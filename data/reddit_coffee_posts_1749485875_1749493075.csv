It was next to two oaks and inside a mulched bed between and surrounding. I’m considering shiny leaf coffee to surround the base of the oaks but would love advice for a smaller layering plant to put in front of the coffee plants. I really like bushier green plants that flower at some point during the year. Kind of an old school southern vibe but wanting to do it with natives. I’m attaching photos of the space as is and then two AI images, one with ferns etc (do NOT like) and the next with bushier natives (like more but doesn’t feel complete).

And we do have a hammock stand but we positioned it just to the left of the oaks, rotated 90° compared to the images and will put it back in that same way (so the images are misleading as far as the hammock goes).

1l7c1gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpTariffNews/comments/1l7c1gv/chinas_may_exports_slow_deflation_deepens_as/,"China's May exports slow, deflation deepens as tariffs bite","BEIJING, June 9 (Reuters) - China's export growth slowed to a three-month low in May as U.S. tariffs slammed shipments, while factory-gate deflation deepened to its worst level in two years, heaping pressure on the world's second-largest economy on both the domestic and external fronts.

U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade war and the swings in Sino-U.S. trade ties have in the past two months sent Chinese exporters, along with their business partners across the Pacific, on a roller coaster ride and hobbled world growth.

Underscoring the U.S. tariff impact on shipments, customs data showed that China's exports to the U.S. plunged 34.5% year-on-year in May in value terms, the sharpest drop since February 2020, when the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic upended global trade.

Total exports from the Asian economic giant expanded 4.8% year-on-year in value terms last month, slowing from the 8.1% jump in April and missing the 5.0% growth expected in a Reuters poll, customs data showed on Monday, despite a lowering of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods which had taken effect in early April.

""It's likely that the May data continued to be weighed down by the peak tariff period,"" said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING.

Song said there was still front-loading of shipments due to the tariff risks, while acceleration of sales to regions other than the United States helped to underpin China's exports.

Imports dropped 3.4% year-on-year, deepening from the 0.2% decline in April and worse than the 0.9% downturn expected in the Reuters poll.

Exports had surged 12.4% year-on-year and 8.1% in March and April, respectively, as factories rushed shipments to the U.S. and other overseas manufacturers to avoid Trump's hefty levies on China and the rest of the world.

While exporters in China found some respite in May as Beijing and Washington agreed to suspend most of their levies for 90 days, tensions between the world's two largest economies remain high and negotiations are underway over issues ranging from China's rare earths controls to Taiwan.

Trade representatives from China and the U.S. are meeting in London on Monday to resume talks after a phone call between their top leaders on Thursday.

China's imports from the U.S. also lost further ground, dropping 18.1% from a 13.8% slide in April.

Zichun Huang, economist at Capital Economics, expects the slowdown in exports growth to ""partially reverse this month, as it reflects the drop in U.S. orders before the trade truce,"" but cautions that shipments will be knocked again by year-end due to elevated tariff levels.

China's exports of rare earths jumped sharply in May despite export restrictions on certain types of rare earth products causing plant closures across the global auto supply chain.

The latest figures do not distinguish between the 17 rare earth elements and related products, some of which are not subject to restrictions. A clearer picture of the impact of the curbs on exports will only be available when more detailed data is released on June 20.

China's May trade surplus came in at $103.22 billion, up from the $96.18 billion the previous month.

Other data, also released on Monday, showed China's imports of crude oil, coal, and iron ore dropped last month, underlining the fragility of domestic demand at a time of rising external headwinds.

Beijing in May rolled out a series of monetary stimulus measures, including cuts to benchmark lending rates and a 500 billion yuan low-cost loan program, aimed at cushioning the trade war's blow to the economy.

China's markets showed muted reaction to the data. The blue-chip CSI300 Index (CSI300) climbed 0.29% and the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) was up 0.43%.

DEFLATIONARY PRESSURES

Producer and consumer price data, released by the National Bureau of Statistics on the same day, showed that deflationary pressures worsened last month.

The producer price index fell 3.3% in May from a year earlier, after a 2.7% decline in April and marked the deepest contraction in 22 months.

Cooling factory activity also highlights the impact of U.S. tariffs on the world's largest manufacturing hub, dampening faster services growth as suspense lingers over the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks.

Retail sales growth slowed last month as spending continued to lag due to job insecurity and stagnant new home prices.

These headwinds were evident in China's car sales for May, which grew 13.9% year-on-year, slowing from a 14.8% increase the previous month, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed.

Sluggish domestic demand and weak prices have weighed on China's economy, which has struggled to mount a robust post-pandemic recovery amid a prolonged property slump and has relied on exports to underpin growth.

Businesses have also had to adapt to the falling prices. U.S. coffee chain Starbucks said on Monday it would lower prices of some iced drinks by an average of 5 yuan in China.

While the core inflation measure, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, registered a slightly faster 0.6% year-on-year rise, from a 0.5% increase in April, Capital Economics' Huang said the improvement looks ""fragile"".

She still expects ""persistent overcapacity will keep China in deflation both this year and next.""",1,1749492811.0,TrumpTariffNews,0,1.0,False
1l7c1du,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l7c1du/i_took_a_shortcut_a_gas_station_attendant_told_me/,I took a shortcut a gas station attendant told me about. The house in the road was just the first trap.,"

This happened three nights ago. I’m a project manager for a large construction firm, and my job often involves visiting sites in the middle of nowhere. This particular job was a five-hour haul from home, a long day of reviewing plans and dealing with contractors that stretched well into the evening. By the time I finally packed my tools and laptop into my truck, it was past 8 PM. The sky was a deep, starless purple, and I was exhausted. Not just tired, but that deep-in-your-bones weariness where your thoughts feel slow and syrupy, and all you can focus on is the singular goal of getting home. Home to my wife, to my own bed. Home to check on our two kids, sleeping soundly and safely.

The first few hours of the drive were a hypnotic blur of asphalt and high beams. I listened to podcasts without really hearing the words, my mind already at home, picturing the familiar comfort of my front door. Sometime around 11:30 PM, the fuel light on my dashboard blinked on, pulling me from my reverie. I spotted a sign for a 24-hour gas station a few miles ahead and pulled off the main highway into one of those lonely oases of fluorescent light that seem to exist only for desperate, late-night travelers.

The air outside was cool and crisp, smelling of pine needles and damp earth. Inside, the station was sterile and silent, save for the low hum of the drink coolers. I grabbed a bitter, burnt-tasting coffee and a bag of beef jerky, hoping the caffeine and salt would be enough to get me through the last leg of the journey. The kid behind the counter looked like he’d been grown in that very store. He was young, maybe nineteen, with lank, dark hair falling into his eyes and an aura of profound, soul-crushing boredom.

I tried to be friendly as he scanned my items. “Long night,” I said with a nod toward the oppressive darkness outside the windows.

He offered a noncommittal grunt in reply.

“Hey,” I said, pulling out my phone and looking at the map app. “My GPS is telling me I’ve still got close to two hours left. You know this area, right? Is there any kind of shortcut? Anything to shave some time off?”

For the first time since I’d walked in, he showed a spark of life. He looked up from the counter, his bored eyes focusing on me. “You’re headed east on the main highway?”

“Yeah, toward the city.”

He leaned forward, lowering his voice conspiratorially, as if he were about to divulge a state secret. “Alright, check it out. In about ten, fifteen miles, the highway’s gonna fork. Big time. The main route curves hard to the right. The sign is massive, lit up like a Christmas tree, you can’t miss it. But there’s a smaller road that goes straight, splits off to the left. It’s an old service road, not really on the maps anymore.”

He tapped a long, pale finger on the formica countertop. “It cuts right through the state forest instead of winding all the way around it. It’s a little rough, you know, but it’s straight as an arrow. It’ll spit you back out on the west side of the suburbs, probably saves you a good forty, forty-five minutes.”

My tired brain lit up at the prospect. Forty-five minutes meant being home before 1 AM. It meant a few precious extra moments of sleep before the kids woke me up at dawn. “Is it safe to drive?” I asked, the last bastion of my common sense putting up a token fight.

He shrugged, the veil of boredom descending over him once more. “It’s a road. Paved and everything. Just, you know, watch out for deer. People use it.”

People use it. That was all the reassurance I needed. “Thanks, man. Seriously. I appreciate it.”

I paid for my stuff, got back into the humming warmth of my truck, and pulled back onto the highway. The coffee was already working its magic, and the promise of an earlier arrival had injected me with a fresh dose of determination.

True to the kid’s word, about fifteen minutes later, the junction appeared. A huge, reflective green sign pointed right, guiding the flow of traffic onto the familiar, well-lit highway. And to the left, there it was: a narrow, dark strip of asphalt that seemed to be swallowed by a solid wall of trees just a few yards in. No lights. No signs. Just an open mouth leading into pure, unadulterated blackness.

Every sensible instinct I possessed was screaming at me to stay on the highway, to stick with the known. But the exhausted, impatient man who just wanted to be home won the argument. With a flick of a turn signal that no one else would see, I turned my truck off the beaten path and into the throat of the forest.

The change was instantaneous and deeply unsettling. The smooth, rhythmic hum of the highway vanished, replaced by the jarring, gravelly crunch of my tires on old, cracked pavement. The wide, open sky was gone, blotted out by a suffocating canopy of ancient trees whose branches knitted together overhead, blocking the moon and stars. My high beams could only penetrate so far, carving a narrow, shifting tunnel through a darkness so complete it felt physical, like swimming through ink. The silence, too, was different. It wasn't peaceful; it was heavy, expectant.

For the first half-hour, it was just me and the road. It twisted and turned more than the kid had let on, and I had to slow down for potholes that were deep enough to swallow a small animal. I didn’t see any deer. I didn’t see any other cars. I didn’t see a single sign of human existence. The unease that had been a small spider on my spine was now a monstrous tarantula, its hairy legs crawling all over my skin. This felt deeply, fundamentally wrong. The kid at the gas station… he’d made it sound like a local secret, not a forgotten path to nowhere.

I glanced at my phone. No signal. Of course.

I told myself to just push through. Turning back now would be an admission of a stupid mistake and would add at least an hour to my drive. It had to lead somewhere. It was a road, after all.

I must have been on it for the better part of an hour when I rounded a particularly sharp, blind curve. And my world came to a screeching, rubber-burning halt.

My foot slammed the brake pedal to the floor. The truck fishtailed slightly, the anti-lock brakes stuttering violently. The acrid smell of hot rubber filled the cab as I stared, my heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird.

Blocking the road, from the overgrown ditch on the left to the crumbling shoulder on the right, was a house.

I just sat there, my mind refusing to compute the data my eyes were feeding it. It wasn’t an old, dilapidated shack. It wasn't a ruin. It was a house. A perfectly normal, if slightly dated, single-story ranch house with pale yellow siding and white shutters. It was the kind of house you see in any quiet, middle-class suburb in the country. It looked like it had been surgically extracted from a peaceful neighborhood and dropped, with malicious intent, in the middle of this godforsaken road.

My first coherent thought was a simple, profane What the fuck.

My second was that I had finally broken. The exhaustion had won. I’d fallen asleep at the wheel and this was a bizarre, vivid stress dream. I reached over and pinched the back of my hand, twisting the skin until a sharp, undeniable bolt of pain shot up my arm. I was awake. I was horrifyingly, impossibly awake.

My headlights painted the scene in a sterile, hyper-realistic light. The windows were dark, glassy voids. There was no driveway, no mailbox, no garden. The ""lawn"" was just the road itself. A small, concrete porch with a single step led to the front door.

And the front door was open.

Not ajar. Not cracked. It was swung wide open, revealing a perfect, featureless rectangle of absolute blackness. It wasn’t an oversight; it was an invitation. An invitation into the suffocating darkness within. The predatory silence of the forest seemed to emanate from that doorway, a palpable vacuum of sound.

My hands were trembling on the steering wheel. This was wrong on a level I didn't have words for. My flight-or-fight response was screaming FLIGHT. The plan was simple: reverse, turn this beast of a truck around, and get the hell out. I didn't care how long it took. I shifted the truck into reverse.

That’s when I saw it. A flicker of movement in the black rectangle of the doorway.

A figure was emerging. At first, it was just a silhouette against the deeper black within. Then, it took a step forward, moving out of the shadows and into the full, unforgiving glare of my high beams.

My blood turned to ice. My breath hitched in my chest. My hand fell from the gear shift.

It was my wife.

It was her. The same height, the same way her brown hair fell across her shoulders, the same slight tilt of her head. She was even wearing the soft blue dress she favored on warm summer evenings, the one with the little embroidered flowers on the collar.

I was frozen, pinned in my seat by a spear of pure, unadulterated terror. My brain was a screaming chaos of denial. It was impossible. She was at home, two hours away. She was in our bed, in our house, in our town. This thing in front of me was a paradox, a walking, breathing violation of all known laws of the universe.

The thing that looked like my wife stood on the single concrete step and smiled. It was her smile. The one that could make my day better in an instant. It was warm, it was loving, it was perfect. She raised a hand and gave a small, familiar wave.

“Honey,” her voice called out. The sound was flawless, a perfect recording of her gentle tone, yet it echoed strangely in the dead air of the forest, like a sound clip played in a soundproof room.

Every cell in my body was screaming. This was a nightmare. This was a trap.

The wife-thing’s smile widened a fraction. It took another step, leaving the porch and planting its feet on the cracked asphalt of the road.

“Come on, dear,” it said, its voice laced with a playful, chiding affection that made my stomach churn. “We were getting worried. You’re late.”

We? The word hit me like a physical blow.

“The kids are already in their rooms,” the creature continued, gesturing with its head back toward the dark, silent house. “They kept asking when their Daddy was coming home.”

The words were a precision strike, aimed directly at my heart. But instead of luring me in, they ignited a spark of rage deep within my terror. It was a confirmation of the calculated, predatory nature of this... this performance. It knew I had a wife. It knew I had children. It knew what to say. How could it know? The kid at the gas station? Did I mention my family? I couldn't remember, my thoughts were a blizzard of panic.

I had to leave. I had to leave NOW. My hand, shaking so badly I could barely control it, fumbled for the gear shift.

And then, a light flickered on in the window to the right of the open door. A soft, warm, yellow glow, like a bedside lamp. And in the square of light, two small shadows appeared.

Silhouettes. One taller, one a little shorter. The unmistakable shapes of two children, standing side-by-side, perfectly still, looking out.

My children.

A choked sob tore itself from my throat. This was a diabolical puppet show, and I was the sole member of the audience. The sight of those little shadows, so innocent and yet so profoundly wrong in this place, shattered the last of my paralysis. This wasn’t just about my own fear anymore. This was a desecration. This thing was wearing the faces of my family, using my love for them as bait on a hook.

Adrenaline and a pure, protective fury surged through me, a white-hot fire that cauterized my fear. I slammed the truck into reverse, my foot stomping the accelerator to the floor. The tires screamed in protest, kicking up a shower of gravel as the truck shot backward. I wrenched the steering wheel, executing a frantic, clumsy turn on the narrow road.

All the while, the thing that looked like my wife just stood there, its placid, loving smile never faltering.

The moment the back of my truck was facing the house, the moment my headlights swung away from the scene, it happened.

A light erupted from the house.

It wasn't the soft, yellow lamp light. This was a silent, concussive blast of pure, clinical white light. It poured from the open door, from every window, a brilliance so intense it was like a sun had been born and died in that small, fake house. It bleached the entire forest in a sterile, shadowless glare, turning midnight into a horrifying, artificial noon. The world was stark black trees against blinding, soul-searing white.

I couldn't help myself. I risked a single glance in my rearview mirror. I had to see the truth.

The thing standing on the road was not my wife.

The light illuminated its true form. The smile was still there, but it was a rictus of fury, stretched impossibly wide across a face that was melting and re-forming. Its jaw was unhinged, dropping down to its chest to reveal a maw filled with rows of needle-thin teeth. Its eyes, once the warm, familiar brown of my wife's, were now just bottomless black pits radiating a hate so profound it felt like a physical force. It was a mask of pure malevolence, enraged that its prey was escaping its carefully set trap.

I floored it. The engine roared as I tore down that dark road, fleeing the impossible light and the abomination it had revealed. I didn’t look back again. I just watched the terrifying white glow shrink in my mirrors, consumed by the trees and the night, until it was gone.

I drove like a man possessed for what felt like an hour but my clock insisted was only about thirty minutes. My knuckles were white, my shirt was soaked in cold sweat. Then, through the trees, I saw the comforting glow of electric light. The gas station.

Relief washed over me, so potent it nearly made me vomit. I’d made it back. I was safe. I pulled into the gravel lot, the crunch of the tires a welcome, normal sound. I killed the engine, and the sudden silence was absolute.

But something was wrong.

As I sat there, gasping for air, trying to slow my runaway heart, I realized two things. First, I hadn’t passed the junction. The fork in the road where I’d turned off was nowhere to be seen. I should have reached it before the station. Second, the gas station was deserted. Utterly empty. No other cars, no trucks at the pumps. Just my truck, the humming coolers, and the glaring lights.

I peered through the large plate-glass window of the store. I could see the kid behind the counter. The same one. Same lank hair, same bored posture.

But he was still. Too still. He was looking down at the counter, frozen in place like a mannequin.

I got out of my truck, leaving the door ajar, and just watched him. The seconds ticked by. He didn't move a single muscle. Not a breath, not a shift of his weight. A new dread, a more subtle and terrifying dread, began to creep in. This wasn’t the end of the trap. This was part two.

As if it knew I was watching, it moved.

Its head lifted. It didn't lift like a person’s. It pivoted on its neck with a slow, unnervingly smooth, mechanical motion. There was no humanity in it. Its face turned to look directly at me through the glass.

And it smiled.

It was the single most horrifying expression I have ever witnessed. It was not a human smile. It was a grotesque facsimile, a wide, predatory stretching of the lips to reveal teeth that were too white, too uniform, too sharp. The eyes above the smile were black, vacant pools, reflecting the fluorescent lights with a dead, soulless sheen. It was the same fundamental wrongness, the same intelligent malevolence I had seen in the face in my rearview mirror.

They knew. They knew I would run, and they knew where I would run to. The house was the crude lure. The gas station—a place of safety and relief—was the real trap.

I didn't think. I scrambled back into the driver's seat, slammed the door, and cranked the engine. I tore out of that fake, dead gas station, leaving the smiling thing to its silent vigil in its glass box.

I just drove, my mind a blank slate of terror. I was back on the same dark, endless road, heading away from the mimic station, completely lost in a nightmare that seemed to have no exit.

Another half an hour of panicked driving, my fuel light now blinking with genuine urgency. And then, I saw it. The junction. The massive green sign for the main highway. And beyond it, a river of red and white lights from other cars. Real cars. Real people.

Just before the junction sat the gas station.

But this one was alive. A semi-truck was at the pumps, its diesel engine rumbling. A family was piling out of a minivan. The light felt different, warmer. It felt real.

I pulled in, my body shaking so violently I could barely put the truck in park. I stumbled into the store, a ghost in my own skin. The kid behind the counter had dark hair, but his face was rounder, his eyes tired but human. He was watching something on his phone.

He looked up as I staggered to the counter. “Whoa, dude,” he said, his eyes widening at the sight of me. “You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

My voice was a dry, cracking whisper. “The shortcut… the road. The left fork.”

He gave me a confused look. “What shortcut? The left fork? Man, that road’s been closed for over a decade. The bridge washed out in a flood. It’s a dead end, doesn’t go anywhere.”

I just stared at him, his words echoing in the vast, empty space where my sanity used to be. “But… you told me it's safe to drive, and people use it! I was just on it. There was a house…”

He leaned on me and whispered, his expression shifting to one of wary concern. “Are you sure it was me who told you that? and let's be clear here, a house? In the middle of the road? Buddy, you need to pull over and get some sleep. You’re seeing things. Seriously, grab another coffee and just stick to the main highway. It’s the only way through.”

I nodded numbly, paid for a coffee I never drank, and left. I took the long way home. That last hour on a busy, well-lit highway was the most beautiful and comforting drive of my entire life.

I got home just before 4 AM. I slipped inside my real house. I checked on my real children, sleeping soundly in their beds, their small chests rising and falling peacefully. I crawled into bed next to my wife, my real, warm, breathing wife, and I lay there in the dark, shaking until the sun came up.

So this is my warning. I don’t know what those things are, but they’re out there. And they’re getting smarter. They built a lure for me out of a house and my family. And when that failed, they had a second, more clever lure ready and waiting: a place of refuge. They are mimics. They learn. They use our deepest desires—the desire to get home, the desire for safety—against us.

So if you’re ever driving late at night, and you’re tired, and someone offers you a shortcut that sounds too good to be true… it is.

Stay on the main road. Stay in the light. Because the things that live in the dark know exactly what you want to see. And they’re more than happy to build it for you.",2,1749492805.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Every sensible instinct I possessed was screaming at me to stay on the highway, to stick with the known. But the exhausted, impatient man who just wanted to be home won the argument. With a flick of a turn signal that no one else would see, I turned my truck off the beaten path and into the throat of the forest.

The change was instantaneous and deeply unsettling. The smooth, rhythmic hum of the highway vanished, replaced by the jarring, gravelly crunch of my tires on old, cracked pavement. The wide, open sky was gone, blotted out by a suffocating canopy of ancient trees whose branches knitted together overhead, blocking the moon and stars. My high beams could only penetrate so far, carving a narrow, shifting tunnel through a darkness so complete it felt physical, like swimming through ink. The silence, too, was different. It wasn't peaceful; it was heavy, expectant.

For the first half-hour, it was just me and the road. It twisted and turned more than the kid had let on, and I had to slow down for potholes that were deep enough to swallow a small animal. I didn’t see any deer. I didn’t see any other cars. I didn’t see a single sign of human existence. The unease that had been a small spider on my spine was now a monstrous tarantula, its hairy legs crawling all over my skin. This felt deeply, fundamentally wrong. The kid at the gas station… he’d made it sound like a local secret, not a forgotten path to nowhere.

I glanced at my phone. No signal. Of course.

I told myself to just push through. Turning back now would be an admission of a stupid mistake and would add at least an hour to my drive. It had to lead somewhere. It was a road, after all.

I must have been on it for the better part of an hour when I rounded a particularly sharp, blind curve. And my world came to a screeching, rubber-burning halt.

My foot slammed the brake pedal to the floor. The truck fishtailed slightly, the anti-lock brakes stuttering violently. The acrid smell of hot rubber filled the cab as I stared, my heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird.

Blocking the road, from the overgrown ditch on the left to the crumbling shoulder on the right, was a house.

I just sat there, my mind refusing to compute the data my eyes were feeding it. It wasn’t an old, dilapidated shack. It wasn't a ruin. It was a house. A perfectly normal, if slightly dated, single-story ranch house with pale yellow siding and white shutters. It was the kind of house you see in any quiet, middle-class suburb in the country. It looked like it had been surgically extracted from a peaceful neighborhood and dropped, with malicious intent, in the middle of this godforsaken road.

My first coherent thought was a simple, profane What the fuck.

My second was that I had finally broken. The exhaustion had won. I’d fallen asleep at the wheel and this was a bizarre, vivid stress dream. I reached over and pinched the back of my hand, twisting the skin until a sharp, undeniable bolt of pain shot up my arm. I was awake. I was horrifyingly, impossibly awake.

My headlights painted the scene in a sterile, hyper-realistic light. The windows were dark, glassy voids. There was no driveway, no mailbox, no garden. The ""lawn"" was just the road itself. A small, concrete porch with a single step led to the front door.

And the front door was open.

Not ajar. Not cracked. It was swung wide open, revealing a perfect, featureless rectangle of absolute blackness. It wasn’t an oversight; it was an invitation. An invitation into the suffocating darkness within. The predatory silence of the forest seemed to emanate from that doorway, a palpable vacuum of sound.

My hands were trembling on the steering wheel. This was wrong on a level I didn't have words for. My flight-or-fight response was screaming FLIGHT. The plan was simple: reverse, turn this beast of a truck around, and get the hell out. I didn't care how long it took. I shifted the truck into reverse.

That’s when I saw it. A flicker of movement in the black rectangle of the doorway.

A figure was emerging. At first, it was just a silhouette against the deeper black within. Then, it took a step forward, moving out of the shadows and into the full, unforgiving glare of my high beams.

My blood turned to ice. My breath hitched in my chest. My hand fell from the gear shift.

It was my wife.

It was her. The same height, the same way her brown hair fell across her shoulders, the same slight tilt of her head. She was even wearing the soft blue dress she favored on warm summer evenings, the one with the little embroidered flowers on the collar.

I was frozen, pinned in my seat by a spear of pure, unadulterated terror. My brain was a screaming chaos of denial. It was impossible. She was at home, two hours away. She was in our bed, in our house, in our town. This thing in front of me was a paradox, a walking, breathing violation of all known laws of the universe.

The thing that looked like my wife stood on the single concrete step and smiled. It was her smile. The one that could make my day better in an instant. It was warm, it was loving, it was perfect. She raised a hand and gave a small, familiar wave.

“Honey,” her voice called out. The sound was flawless, a perfect recording of her gentle tone, yet it echoed strangely in the dead air of the forest, like a sound clip played in a soundproof room.

Every cell in my body was screaming. This was a nightmare. This was a trap.

The wife-thing’s smile widened a fraction. It took another step, leaving the porch and planting its feet on the cracked asphalt of the road.

“Come on, dear,” it said, its voice laced with a playful, chiding affection that made my stomach churn. “We were getting worried. You’re late.”

We? The word hit me like a physical blow.

“The kids are already in their rooms,” the creature continued, gesturing with its head back toward the dark, silent house. “They kept asking when their Daddy was coming home.”

The words were a precision strike, aimed directly at my heart. But instead of luring me in, they ignited a spark of rage deep within my terror. It was a confirmation of the calculated, predatory nature of this... this performance. It knew I had a wife. It knew I had children. It knew what to say. How could it know? The kid at the gas station? Did I mention my family? I couldn't remember, my thoughts were a blizzard of panic.

I had to leave. I had to leave NOW. My hand, shaking so badly I could barely control it, fumbled for the gear shift.

And then, a light flickered on in the window to the right of the open door. A soft, warm, yellow glow, like a bedside lamp. And in the square of light, two small shadows appeared.

Silhouettes. One taller, one a little shorter. The unmistakable shapes of two children, standing side-by-side, perfectly still, looking out.

My children.

A choked sob tore itself from my throat. This was a diabolical puppet show, and I was the sole member of the audience. The sight of those little shadows, so innocent and yet so profoundly wrong in this place, shattered the last of my paralysis. This wasn’t just about my own fear anymore. This was a desecration. This thing was wearing the faces of my family, using my love for them as bait on a hook.

Adrenaline and a pure, protective fury surged through me, a white-hot fire that cauterized my fear. I slammed the truck into reverse, my foot stomping the accelerator to the floor. The tires screamed in protest, kicking up a shower of gravel as the truck shot backward. I wrenched the steering wheel, executing a frantic, clumsy turn on the narrow road.

All the while, the thing that looked like my wife just stood there, its placid, loving smile never faltering.

The moment the back of my truck was facing the house, the moment my headlights swung away from the scene, it happened.

A light erupted from the house.

It wasn't the soft, yellow lamp light. This was a silent, concussive blast of pure, clinical white light. It poured from the open door, from every window, a brilliance so intense it was like a sun had been born and died in that small, fake house. It bleached the entire forest in a sterile, shadowless glare, turning midnight into a horrifying, artificial noon. The world was stark black trees against blinding, soul-searing white.

I couldn't help myself. I risked a single glance in my rearview mirror. I had to see the truth.

The thing standing on the road was not my wife.

The light illuminated its true form. The smile was still there, but it was a rictus of fury, stretched impossibly wide across a face that was melting and re-forming. Its jaw was unhinged, dropping down to its chest to reveal a maw filled with rows of needle-thin teeth. Its eyes, once the warm, familiar brown of my wife's, were now just bottomless black pits radiating a hate so profound it felt like a physical force. It was a mask of pure malevolence, enraged that its prey was escaping its carefully set trap.

I floored it. The engine roared as I tore down that dark road, fleeing the impossible light and the abomination it had revealed. I didn’t look back again. I just watched the terrifying white glow shrink in my mirrors, consumed by the trees and the night, until it was gone.

I drove like a man possessed for what felt like an hour but my clock insisted was only about thirty minutes. My knuckles were white, my shirt was soaked in cold sweat. Then, through the trees, I saw the comforting glow of electric light. The gas station.

Relief washed over me, so potent it nearly made me vomit. I’d made it back. I was safe. I pulled into the gravel lot, the crunch of the tires a welcome, normal sound. I killed the engine, and the sudden silence was absolute.

But something was wrong.

As I sat there, gasping for air, trying to slow my runaway heart, I realized two things. First, I hadn’t passed the junction. The fork in the road where I’d turned off was nowhere to be seen. I should have reached it before the station. Second, the gas station was deserted. Utterly empty. No other cars, no trucks at the pumps. Just my truck, the humming coolers, and the glaring lights.

I peered through the large plate-glass window of the store. I could see the kid behind the counter. The same one. Same lank hair, same bored posture.

But he was still. Too still. He was looking down at the counter, frozen in place like a mannequin.

I got out of my truck, leaving the door ajar, and just watched him. The seconds ticked by. He didn't move a single muscle. Not a breath, not a shift of his weight. A new dread, a more subtle and terrifying dread, began to creep in. This wasn’t the end of the trap. This was part two.

As if it knew I was watching, it moved.

Its head lifted. It didn't lift like a person’s. It pivoted on its neck with a slow, unnervingly smooth, mechanical motion. There was no humanity in it. Its face turned to look directly at me through the glass.

And it smiled.

It was the single most horrifying expression I have ever witnessed. It was not a human smile. It was a grotesque facsimile, a wide, predatory stretching of the lips to reveal teeth that were too white, too uniform, too sharp. The eyes above the smile were black, vacant pools, reflecting the fluorescent lights with a dead, soulless sheen. It was the same fundamental wrongness, the same intelligent malevolence I had seen in the face in my rearview mirror.

They knew. They knew I would run, and they knew where I would run to. The house was the crude lure. The gas station—a place of safety and relief—was the real trap.

I didn't think. I scrambled back into the driver's seat, slammed the door, and cranked the engine. I tore out of that fake, dead gas station, leaving the smiling thing to its silent vigil in its glass box.

I just drove, my mind a blank slate of terror. I was back on the same dark, endless road, heading away from the mimic station, completely lost in a nightmare that seemed to have no exit.

Another half an hour of panicked driving, my fuel light now blinking with genuine urgency. And then, I saw it. The junction. The massive green sign for the main highway. And beyond it, a river of red and white lights from other cars. Real cars. Real people.

Just before the junction sat the gas station.

But this one was alive. A semi-truck was at the pumps, its diesel engine rumbling. A family was piling out of a minivan. The light felt different, warmer. It felt real.

I pulled in, my body shaking so violently I could barely put the truck in park. I stumbled into the store, a ghost in my own skin. The kid behind the counter had dark hair, but his face was rounder, his eyes tired but human. He was watching something on his phone.

He looked up as I staggered to the counter. “Whoa, dude,” he said, his eyes widening at the sight of me. “You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

My voice was a dry, cracking whisper. “The shortcut… the road. The left fork.”

He gave me a confused look. “What shortcut? The left fork? Man, that road’s been closed for over a decade. The bridge washed out in a flood. It’s a dead end, doesn’t go anywhere.”

I just stared at him, his words echoing in the vast, empty space where my sanity used to be. “But… you told me it's safe to drive, and people use it! I was just on it. There was a house…”

He leaned on me and whispered, his expression shifting to one of wary concern. “Are you sure it was me who told you that? and let's be clear here, a house? In the middle of the road? Buddy, you need to pull over and get some sleep. You’re seeing things. Seriously, grab another coffee and just stick to the main highway. It’s the only way through.”

I nodded numbly, paid for a coffee I never drank, and left. I took the long way home. That last hour on a busy, well-lit highway was the most beautiful and comforting drive of my entire life.

I got home just before 4 AM. I slipped inside my real house. I checked on my real children, sleeping soundly in their beds, their small chests rising and falling peacefully. I crawled into bed next to my wife, my real, warm, breathing wife, and I lay there in the dark, shaking until the sun came up.

So this is my warning. I don’t know what those things are, but they’re out there. And they’re getting smarter. They built a lure for me out of a house and my family. And when that failed, they had a second, more clever lure ready and waiting: a place of refuge. They are mimics. They learn. They use our deepest desires—the desire to get home, the desire for safety—against us.

So if you’re ever driving late at night, and you’re tired, and someone offers you a shortcut that sounds too good to be true… it is.

Stay on the main road. Stay in the light. Because the things that live in the dark know exactly what you want to see. And they’re more than happy to build it for you.",1,1749492781.0,stories,0,1.0,False

so I’ve been seeing this boy (19m) for the last 3 months. For some context me and my ex broke up not that long ago due to long distance issues and reoccurring fights. However he came back two weeks ago and I knew he was going to come back to work (we work in the same place). To avoid awkwardness I asked him out for coffee and it was super mature of us, we cleared the air and after an hour went our separate ways and haven’t spoken since. 

Now this is where the real issue begins. I never told the guy I’m talking to that I met up with my ex because it quite frankly wasn’t worth mentioning. Nothing inappropriate was talked about, we met up in a very public place and we both just wanted to give each other a last final Sorry for what happened during our relationship. And most importantly I didn’t want this guy to overthink this and panic that I might want to get back with my ex because that’s not what the meet up was about. Well this guy that I am talking to snooped through my phone last night AFTER ASKING ME TO BE HIS GF. he didn’t say anything at first but freaked out on me at work because he seen my exs name in my messages from two weeks ago. 

Idk if I’m in the wrong but I thought that was a complete breach of privacy and I’m glad that I said no to being his gf!!

He also started comparing me to his ex who used to cheat on him and was a complete tramp (sorry for the foul language). But I was genuinely so offended.

For some context about myself, I am F20 about to be 21 and I like to think of myself as very mature. I have went through my fair share of toxic relationships that have fucked my trust for men but never in a million years would I have looked through someone else’s messages?? Like is that normal?

I’m not really sure what to do right now because up until now he hasn’t shown any signs of trust issues and our relationship was going so well.",1,1749492777.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I work in an office, although I love my job, I can’t leave my station without someone else watching my station while I’m gone. I had an incident where I had to go to the bathroom really bad, I hold it for hours because the person relieving people had someone on break. After a while, I couldn’t hold it anymore so I asked a coworker who I know can’t stand me and always snitching even if I step away from my station for a second to grab something. I had no choice I asked that coworker to check my station here and there for a few minutes. That coworker said no.

I had to freaking hold it for almost 40 more minutes until the other shift came and the person relieving me was taking their sweet time. I can’t take this anymore.

I love my job but what the helly… I’m a woman when I have my period I like to change my tampons every 4hrs or so because of cleanliness, and fear of toxic chock syndrome. I don’t want to wear a tampon for 8hrs 😭😭😭. I get anxious when my period comes and I have to work because of how often I might have to go to the bathroom. And it takes me a while to change my tampon, cause I’m just starting to use them. I also have to clean a little before I put a new one… I can’t help but get crazy anxiety to the point of heart pounding when I’m on my period. 

I stopped drinking coffee and energy drinks at work or right before work because they make me pee a lot and I don’t have the privilege of going to the bathroom too many times.
I don’t drink enough water while working because of I can’t go pee a lot.
I don’t eat certain food I enjoy on days I have to work because I have to schedule my bowel to know what time I’ll be on my break and what time I’ll get home. 
I get so dehydrated my lips be cracking sometimes because if I drink too much water I will constantly have to go to the bathroom… Even though I’m taking meds that cause dry mouth, I’m supposed to be sipping water. I really do love my job and what I do but I don’t know what to do.

This happened three nights ago. I’m a project manager for a large construction firm, and my job often involves visiting sites in the middle of nowhere. This particular job was a five-hour haul from home, a long day of reviewing plans and dealing with contractors that stretched well into the evening. By the time I finally packed my tools and laptop into my truck, it was past 8 PM. The sky was a deep, starless purple, and I was exhausted. Not just tired, but that deep-in-your-bones weariness where your thoughts feel slow and syrupy, and all you can focus on is the singular goal of getting home. Home to my wife, to my own bed. Home to check on our two kids, sleeping soundly and safely.

The first few hours of the drive were a hypnotic blur of asphalt and high beams. I listened to podcasts without really hearing the words, my mind already at home, picturing the familiar comfort of my front door. Sometime around 11:30 PM, the fuel light on my dashboard blinked on, pulling me from my reverie. I spotted a sign for a 24-hour gas station a few miles ahead and pulled off the main highway into one of those lonely oases of fluorescent light that seem to exist only for desperate, late-night travelers.

The air outside was cool and crisp, smelling of pine needles and damp earth. Inside, the station was sterile and silent, save for the low hum of the drink coolers. I grabbed a bitter, burnt-tasting coffee and a bag of beef jerky, hoping the caffeine and salt would be enough to get me through the last leg of the journey. The kid behind the counter looked like he’d been grown in that very store. He was young, maybe nineteen, with lank, dark hair falling into his eyes and an aura of profound, soul-crushing boredom.

I tried to be friendly as he scanned my items. “Long night,” I said with a nod toward the oppressive darkness outside the windows.

He offered a noncommittal grunt in reply.

“Hey,” I said, pulling out my phone and looking at the map app. “My GPS is telling me I’ve still got close to two hours left. You know this area, right? Is there any kind of shortcut? Anything to shave some time off?”

For the first time since I’d walked in, he showed a spark of life. He looked up from the counter, his bored eyes focusing on me. “You’re headed east on the main highway?”

“Yeah, toward the city.”

He leaned forward, lowering his voice conspiratorially, as if he were about to divulge a state secret. “Alright, check it out. In about ten, fifteen miles, the highway’s gonna fork. Big time. The main route curves hard to the right. The sign is massive, lit up like a Christmas tree, you can’t miss it. But there’s a smaller road that goes straight, splits off to the left. It’s an old service road, not really on the maps anymore.”

He tapped a long, pale finger on the formica countertop. “It cuts right through the state forest instead of winding all the way around it. It’s a little rough, you know, but it’s straight as an arrow. It’ll spit you back out on the west side of the suburbs, probably saves you a good forty, forty-five minutes.”

My tired brain lit up at the prospect. Forty-five minutes meant being home before 1 AM. It meant a few precious extra moments of sleep before the kids woke me up at dawn. “Is it safe to drive?” I asked, the last bastion of my common sense putting up a token fight.

He shrugged, the veil of boredom descending over him once more. “It’s a road. Paved and everything. Just, you know, watch out for deer. People use it.”

People use it. That was all the reassurance I needed. “Thanks, man. Seriously. I appreciate it.”

I paid for my stuff, got back into the humming warmth of my truck, and pulled back onto the highway. The coffee was already working its magic, and the promise of an earlier arrival had injected me with a fresh dose of determination.

True to the kid’s word, about fifteen minutes later, the junction appeared. A huge, reflective green sign pointed right, guiding the flow of traffic onto the familiar, well-lit highway. And to the left, there it was: a narrow, dark strip of asphalt that seemed to be swallowed by a solid wall of trees just a few yards in. No lights. No signs. Just an open mouth leading into pure, unadulterated blackness.

I drove like a man possessed for what felt like an hour but my clock insisted was only about thirty minutes. My knuckles were white, my shirt was soaked in cold sweat. Then, through the trees, I saw the comforting glow of electric light. The gas station.

Relief washed over me, so potent it nearly made me vomit. I’d made it back. I was safe. I pulled into the gravel lot, the crunch of the tires a welcome, normal sound. I killed the engine, and the sudden silence was absolute.

But something was wrong.

As I sat there, gasping for air, trying to slow my runaway heart, I realized two things. First, I hadn’t passed the junction. The fork in the road where I’d turned off was nowhere to be seen. I should have reached it before the station. Second, the gas station was deserted. Utterly empty. No other cars, no trucks at the pumps. Just my truck, the humming coolers, and the glaring lights.

I peered through the large plate-glass window of the store. I could see the kid behind the counter. The same one. Same lank hair, same bored posture.

But he was still. Too still. He was looking down at the counter, frozen in place like a mannequin.

I got out of my truck, leaving the door ajar, and just watched him. The seconds ticked by. He didn't move a single muscle. Not a breath, not a shift of his weight. A new dread, a more subtle and terrifying dread, began to creep in. This wasn’t the end of the trap. This was part two.

As if it knew I was watching, it moved.

Its head lifted. It didn't lift like a person’s. It pivoted on its neck with a slow, unnervingly smooth, mechanical motion. There was no humanity in it. Its face turned to look directly at me through the glass.

And it smiled.

It was the single most horrifying expression I have ever witnessed. It was not a human smile. It was a grotesque facsimile, a wide, predatory stretching of the lips to reveal teeth that were too white, too uniform, too sharp. The eyes above the smile were black, vacant pools, reflecting the fluorescent lights with a dead, soulless sheen. It was the same fundamental wrongness, the same intelligent malevolence I had seen in the face in my rearview mirror.

They knew. They knew I would run, and they knew where I would run to. The house was the crude lure. The gas station—a place of safety and relief—was the real trap.

I didn't think. I scrambled back into the driver's seat, slammed the door, and cranked the engine. I tore out of that fake, dead gas station, leaving the smiling thing to its silent vigil in its glass box.

I just drove, my mind a blank slate of terror. I was back on the same dark, endless road, heading away from the mimic station, completely lost in a nightmare that seemed to have no exit.

Another half an hour of panicked driving, my fuel light now blinking with genuine urgency. And then, I saw it. The junction. The massive green sign for the main highway. And beyond it, a river of red and white lights from other cars. Real cars. Real people.

Just before the junction sat the gas station.

But this one was alive. A semi-truck was at the pumps, its diesel engine rumbling. A family was piling out of a minivan. The light felt different, warmer. It felt real.

I pulled in, my body shaking so violently I could barely put the truck in park. I stumbled into the store, a ghost in my own skin. The kid behind the counter had dark hair, but his face was rounder, his eyes tired but human. He was watching something on his phone.

He looked up as I staggered to the counter. “Whoa, dude,” he said, his eyes widening at the sight of me. “You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

My voice was a dry, cracking whisper. “The shortcut… the road. The left fork.”

He gave me a confused look. “What shortcut? The left fork? Man, that road’s been closed for over a decade. The bridge washed out in a flood. It’s a dead end, doesn’t go anywhere.”

I just stared at him, his words echoing in the vast, empty space where my sanity used to be. “But… you told me it's safe to drive, and people use it! I was just on it. There was a house…”

He leaned on me and whispered, his expression shifting to one of wary concern. “Are you sure it was me who told you that? and let's be clear here, a house? In the middle of the road? Buddy, you need to pull over and get some sleep. You’re seeing things. Seriously, grab another coffee and just stick to the main highway. It’s the only way through.”

I nodded numbly, paid for a coffee I never drank, and left. I took the long way home. That last hour on a busy, well-lit highway was the most beautiful and comforting drive of my entire life.

I got home just before 4 AM. I slipped inside my real house. I checked on my real children, sleeping soundly in their beds, their small chests rising and falling peacefully. I crawled into bed next to my wife, my real, warm, breathing wife, and I lay there in the dark, shaking until the sun came up.

So this is my warning. I don’t know what those things are, but they’re out there. And they’re getting smarter. They built a lure for me out of a house and my family. And when that failed, they had a second, more clever lure ready and waiting: a place of refuge. They are mimics. They learn. They use our deepest desires—the desire to get home, the desire for safety—against us.

So if you’re ever driving late at night, and you’re tired, and someone offers you a shortcut that sounds too good to be true… it is.

Stay on the main road. Stay in the light. Because the things that live in the dark know exactly what you want to see. And they’re more than happy to build it for you.",2,1749492752.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Instead of changing my recipe, I decided to get a cheap paper filter and pour over funnel and try to filter out the fines.  Delicious.  Utterrly amazing.

1l7bt6s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7bt6s,Looking for some finishing touch advice for our living/dining room!,"Hi everyone

After seeing some brilliant posts and thoughtful feedback on here, I thought I’d share where we’re up to with our living and dining space and get your thoughts.

I’ve included some before and after pics. This is our first home, so we had the luxury of decorating before buying any furniture, and we’ve taken our time to try and get it right. So far we’re really happy with the progress. The walls and furniture are all sorted, and now we just want to make it feel warmer and more “us”.

Here’s where we’re at and what we’re still unsure on.

• We’re considering sheer curtains for the back window (the privacy film is just a temporary fix), possibly layered with burnt orange curtains. Open to colour suggestions.

• We originally planned a big rectangular rug under the sofa, but it’s a pull-out with a footrest, so we’d need something quite thin. Now we’re thinking a round rug that just pokes out from underneath, echoing the spiral staircase and round lamps.

• We’ve got a bench on one side of the dining table, but just two very temporary bistro chairs for now. Would love ideas for something comfier that still fits the space. We were possibly thinking a denim blue or a mustard yellow (or both)

• We really wanted a coffee table, but with the pull-out sofa we’re now thinking side tables or maybe a narrow sideboard would work better for our morning coffees.

• We’ve got a few plants and lamps that still need proper homes. Maybe some tiered stands or shelves.

• We definitely need something to give the walls more personality. We’re thinking a mix of artwork, mirrors or shelving, but we’re not sure where to start.

• We really love what we’ve done so far, but would massively appreciate any ideas for how to finish the space off. Unless your advice is “scrap the whole thing” in which case, straight in the bin with you 😅

Thanks in advance 💚

I’ve decided to smash the hourglass. I’ve healed in every way except one, I don’t want to hate you. I want to smile when memories of you cross my mind. When a familiar scent comes out of nowhere and reaches my nose, I want to breathe it in deeply and enjoy it.

I want my thoughts of our marriage to be happy reminders of love, trust, and togetherness. I remember you in such vivid detail—your morning routine, walking straight to the coffee maker and then stepping outside to smoke while waiting for your coffee. I remember how you never left a room without telling me you loved me, the way you would cross your legs on the bed when you worked from home, and how you never wore too much makeup because your natural beauty was more than enough.

I don’t want to erase you from my memories; I don’t want your special place in my heart to be lost. There was a time I would have given my life to forget you, but I was a fool for ever wanting that. I accept that we couldn’t stay married, and I understand why we couldn’t remain friends. What I won’t accept is losing how happy you made me, how deeply I was in love with you, and how much fun we had together. I wouldn’t want to live one more second of this life without those memories.

I'm freeing myself from all hateful, delusional thoughts. My mind may have made up false narratives, but I am releasing myself from any trauma, scars, or negative thoughts I might have had. I need and want our time together to be viewed as a precious chapter in my life that I will never forget because I don’t regret any of it.

But Seriously let's Makeout!!!

I dropped what I was charging for the room significantly since I want to rent it out quickly before I leave. Below is information about the room.

Im renting out my room from Mid June-August(if you would like a shorter stay that can be arranged) The house has a large backyard and driveway; there are currently 5 other guys living there although during the summer the majority will be gone. The place also has a in unit washer and dryer. 

The furnished room will include:
- 2 mini-fridges
- A queen sized bed

She aproched me and asked for my number, didn't even ask if I'm into woman. I kinda liked that boldnes so I gave her my number and we started texting. She's 25, has good job, she's smart, sweet talker, polite. We went out for first time few days after first text, went for some drinks, took a walk and sat down at park talking. She told me she'll drive me home and didn't even kiss me, just asked to see me again. We went out next night, we kissed in her car, but as things got hotter I told her I never went further from kissing. I just turned 20, and until recently I lived in small town, where there's no really much gay woman. She was extremly sweet saying she didn't have any other intentions anyways,  just wanted to kiss me, and that she wouldn't do it in a car anyway.

We keept going out every day just kissing, cuddling in her car, she was extremly sweet, she even drove me to my work. That's when my coworker saw her car, and told me her name, asking if that's her. And I was confused how she knows her name and she told me her bestfriend used to go out with her. Told me how that girl is extremly chaotic when it comes to changing partners, that she was with a lot off girls, and allways dumped them in the end, also heavy on alcohol and partys. I didn't really belive that, as she's extremly femme, and honestly I had those stereotype that usualy mascs woman are more off a players.

Week after that we ended up at her place, she was extremly good looking that night and I really liked her and wanted my first time to be with her.
We had sex, it was great, I feelt really safe and protected by her. She was sweet and went slow, and also asked if I'm 100% sure a lot. Next morning she went under shower with me, we did it again, we went to get coffee, and she drove me home. She texted me after that, but since then was allways to busy to see me. To much work not enough time, and then few days ago she just stoped texting me. And I feel really stupid for thinking she's not like that.

I’ve gone almost everyday because their consistency hits the mark every time. The coffee, pastries, even ice cream are all lovely. The customer service is well….. meh. 

The staff themselves are lovely. The barista in the morning with the purple hair remembers my order and is so personable. There was another girl I don’t see anymore but who was also just as lovely. However, the owner and their newest manager definitely kills the vibe. 
The owner was super nice to me when they first opened. I saw him everyday, he would acknowledge the fact he always saw me. I felt seen. These last few months, the professionalism has definitely lacked. I’ve heard him talking about his staff in front of them, saying and calling them HORRIBLE things. He would talk about how they looked and dressed, talking about firing them loud enough to where the workers are visibly uncomfortable and can hear what he is saying. Their new manager does the same but with the actual staff themselves. They recently fired a young man and I heard the conversation get told at least to 4 other people while I was there. You would think as a manager things would be more professional out of respect for the other party, right? Nobody needs full details of your conversation. It seemed like all it did was cause drama and speculation because I heard other individuals talking about it days following. It is uncomfortable for both sides of the counter, as a customer and an employee. 

In all, they have lost me as a customer. The owner is a veteran, but no excuse for how horrible it sounds like it is to work there/how they treat their staff. Their new manager is way too over the top trying hard to look good and the customer service is so obviously fake and quite honestly, annoying. 

I will miss coming here in the early mornings because of the pastries, but I definitely can find somewhere who treats their staff with honesty and respect.

#⁢ Best Granite Sealer 2025: Reviews⁣ & Buying‌ Guide

Granite countertops⁣ and surfaces⁢ are a gorgeous and durable addition‍ to any home, but they require proper maintenance to keep them looking their best.⁣ One of teh most meaningful aspects of granite maintenance is sealing. Granite is a porous stone, meaning it can absorb liquids and stains if not properly protected.A good⁤ granite⁣ sealer ‍creates a barrier that prevents‍ liquids from penetrating the stone, protecting it from staining, etching, and ‌other damage. This⁣ guide ⁣will ⁢help you choose the best granite sealer for ⁣your needs, ensuring your granite surfaces​ remain beautiful and pristine for ‍years to‍ come.

[[Explore Top Rated granite sealer on Amazon.]](https://blog.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=granite sealer)

## Key Features Analysis

The best ⁢granite sealers‌ on the⁤ market today offer a range ‍of features designed to‌ protect and enhance your granite surfaces.

**Penetrating Seal:** A penetrating sealer works ⁤by ⁣soaking into the‍ pores of the granite and creating a hydrophobic barrier within the ⁣stone itself. This type of sealer doesn't form a surface coating,allowing the granite to⁤ retain it's natural appearance and breathability. Penetrating⁤ sealers offer long-lasting protection ⁤and ‍are less prone to wear and tear compared to topical sealers.

**Water and oil Repellency:** The ability to repel both water and oil is crucial for a granite ⁣sealer.‍ Water-based stains can leave behind unsightly rings ⁣and marks, while oil-based ‌stains can penetrate deep ​into the stone and be extremely difficult to remove. A high-quality sealer‍ will effectively repel‍ both types of‍ liquids, preventing ‌stains‍ from setting in.

**UV Protection:** Exposure to sunlight can cause ⁣some sealers to break down over⁣ time, ‍reducing their effectiveness. ⁢Sealers with UV protection‍ are formulated to resist degradation from UV rays, ensuring they maintain their protective properties even⁣ in areas⁤ with high⁣ sun ‍exposure. This is especially important for outdoor granite surfaces, such as countertops or patios.

**Food⁣ Safe Formulation:**‍ If you're sealing granite countertops​ in your‌ kitchen, it's critically important to choose a⁢ sealer that is food safe.this‌ means that the sealer is non-toxic and won't leach harmful chemicals into your⁤ food. Look for sealers ​that are certified by⁤ reputable organizations for⁣ food safety.

Key features to consider ⁤when ​choosing a granite sealer include:

*   ‌Penetrating Seal
*   Water and Oil Repellency
*   UV Protection
* ‌  Food Safe Formulation

## core ⁣Benefits

Choosing the right granite sealer offers numerous practical ​benefits that extend the life ⁤and beauty of your ‍granite surfaces.

**Stain Prevention:**⁣ A properly applied‌ granite sealer will prevent stains from setting into the stone. This means that spills like wine, coffee, juice, and​ oil ⁤can ‍be easily wiped away without leaving any lasting marks. ⁣This ‍is particularly important in high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms where spills⁤ are common.

**Etch Resistance:** While sealers ‍primarily focus on stain prevention, some also offer ‌a degree of⁣ protection⁣ against etching. ‍Etching ‍occurs when acidic substances like lemon juice or vinegar react with the minerals in the granite, dulling‍ the surface. While a sealer won't entirely prevent etching,⁣ it ⁤can⁢ minimize the damage.

**Ease‌ of Cleaning:** Sealed granite is much⁢ easier to‌ clean ​than unsealed granite. The protective barrier created by the sealer prevents dirt and ‌grime from ‍penetrating the stone,‍ making it ‍easier to wipe away with a damp ⁣cloth. This reduces ⁤the need for harsh cleaning chemicals, which can potentially ⁤damage‌ the granite over time.

**Extended Lifespan:** By protecting⁤ your granite from⁤ stains, etching, and other damage, a sealer helps to ⁢extend its lifespan. Properly sealed granite will maintain its beauty and integrity for many ⁣years, saving you the ⁢cost and hassle of replacing it prematurely.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the⁣ right granite sealer can be‍ confusing, so here are some answers to common questions.

**How⁢ often should I⁤ seal my granite ‍countertops?**
The frequency of sealing depends on⁢ the​ type of granite, the ⁢type of ‍sealer used, and the amount of use ​the countertop receives. Generally, it's recommended to seal granite countertops every⁣ 1-3 years.You can test if your ​countertop needs sealing by dropping a few ‌drops ‌of water⁢ on the surface. If⁤ the water ⁤beads up, the countertop ‌is still sealed. If the‌ water⁣ soaks in ​within a few minutes,it's time to reseal.

**What types of⁤ granite⁢ sealers are available?**
There are two main types of granite sealers: penetrating sealers⁢ and ⁤topical sealers. Penetrating⁣ sealers soak into ‍the pores‌ of the granite and create a hydrophobic barrier within the stone. Topical sealers form a protective coating on​ the surface⁤ of ⁤the granite. Penetrating sealers ​are generally ​preferred‍ for their ​long-lasting protection and natural appearance.

**Can I use any type of cleaner on ⁤sealed granite?**
It's important to use a pH-neutral cleaner on sealed granite. Harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, and acidic⁤ cleaners can damage the sealer ⁢and the‌ granite itself. Look for cleaners specifically designed for use on granite⁢ or ‍natural⁤ stone.A mild dish‍ soap and water solution is also a safe and effective option⁢ for everyday‌ cleaning.

## Competitor ⁢comparison

Let's compare ⁣a top-rated general choice against‌ two strong competitors.

### ‌Product Comparison ⁤Overview

#### Granite Gold Sealer
- ⁢  ‍**Penetrating Action:** Effectively ​penetrates‌ the granite‍ pores to create a strong protective barrier.
-   **Water-Based formula:** Low⁤ VOC formula making it‌ safer and ‌environmentally friendly.
- ‌  **Ease of Submission:** Simple⁤ spray-on application for quick and easy⁤ sealing.

#### stonetech BulletProof ‌Sealer
-   ‌**advanced ​Fluoropolymer Technology:** ⁣Offers superior stain resistance compared to traditional sealers.
-‍   ⁣**solvent-Based:** Provides excellent penetration and⁢ durability.
-   ‍**Higher VOC Content:** more potent formula but ⁤contains higher⁤ levels of volatile organic⁢ compounds.#### Miracle Sealants 511 Impregnator
-   **Versatile Usage:** ‍Suitable⁣ for a wide variety of natural ‌stone‌ surfaces including ⁣granite, marble,‌ and limestone.
-   **Durable Protection:** Provides long-lasting protection against water and oil-based stains.
-   **Multiple Applications May be needed:** Results ⁢might take multiple applications to reach protection level of competitors.

###‌ Key Differences Summary
Granite Gold excels in⁤ user-friendliness and safety with ‌its water-based, ‍low-VOC formula. ⁤StoneTech offers​ superior stain​ resistance due to its advanced​ fluoropolymer technology, though, requires more caution due‌ to being solvent-based. Miracle Sealants ⁣511 provides very good results on many surfaces, however, might take ‌extra applications to​ provide top-tier protection. For homeowners prioritizing ‌ease of use ⁢and⁣ environmental concerns, Granite Gold is an ⁢excellent⁢ choice. For those ⁤seeking maximum stain protection and‍ willing to work with a solvent-based ​formula, StoneTech is a worthy investment.

**Homeowners with granite⁢ Countertops:** Homeowners who have invested in granite countertops want to protect their investment and keep their countertops looking their best. A good granite sealer is essential for ​preventing stains, etching, and other⁣ damage that can diminish the⁣ beauty and value of their countertops. Regular sealing helps to maintain the ‌integrity of the granite and extend its lifespan.

**Property Managers​ of Commercial Spaces:** Property managers responsible for maintaining commercial‌ spaces with granite surfaces,‌ such ⁤as hotels, restaurants, and office buildings, need ⁣a​ reliable sealer to protect those surfaces from‍ heavy use and potential ​spills.

1l7bl9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1l7bl9j/want_to_help_those_looking_for_help/,Want to Help Those Looking for Help,"So, I never thought I'd be sitting where I am today. In a clean(ish) home office, not a blue bottle in sight. Not for over 19 - 20 days or more. I know people have shared their vitimin stacks, and what worked for them in the past, but I figured the more info available to us, the better. So buckle up, im going to copy and paste from my own recovery journal, I turned into a kindle book. I hope this finds someone who needs it, and helps them. 

I know its super long... but one thing to look out for is something called Rebound Withdrawal. This happened to me on Day 10 / 11... I was feeling Great, then that night it felt like I was back to Night 1 or 2. It Sucked, and I want others to be aware that it ""Could"" Happen.  Again, this is by no means the be all end all of withdrawal recovery... it's just my story, and what helped me. 

\---------------------------

Putting the Vitimin Stack First, cause thats more helpful than the what to expect part: 

What to Expect When You're Expecting Withdrawl:



# Supplements: What to Take, When, and Why

*Not medical advice. Just what helped me and others in the trenches.*

#  Morning Stack (Dopamine + Energy + Calm)

* **L-Tyrosine** (500... 1000mg): Replenishes dopamine precursor. May help motivation and focus.
* **Rhodiola Rosea** (100... 200mg): Adaptogen that supports stress recovery and energy without jitters.
* **Magnesium Glycinate** (200... 400mg): Nervous system support. Calms the buzz without sedation.
* **B-Complex**: Supports nervous system, especially energy metabolism and mood regulation.
* **Vitamin C**: Cellular recovery and immune support.
* **Omega-3 (Fish Oil)**: Brain inflammation control. Mood stabilization.  

  


# Evening Stack (Calm + Sleep Support)

* **Magnesium Glycinate or Threonate**: Take again in the evening.
* **L-Theanine** (100... 200mg): Boosts GABA and promotes calm focus.
* **Passionflower or Valerian Root**: Gentle herbal sleep support.
* **Melatonin** (0.3... 1mg): Reset circadian rhythm without hangover effect.
* **Glycine** (3g in warm water): Calming amino acid that promotes better sleep architecture.  

Optional:

* **CBD (low dose)**: Some people find it helps calm anxiety or buzzing sensations. *(Just don’t swap one crutch for another.)*  





# Hydration & Electrolyte Balance

Withdrawal *drains* you ...  literally.

1. You’re sweating.
2. You’re yacking up lunch you didn’t eat in 2 weeks.
3. You’re crying.
4. You’re probably not eating right.  

And your cells are freaking out without the proper electrolyte support.

**Must-haves:**

* **Electrolyte powders** like LMNT, Liquid IV, or homemade (sea salt + lemon + honey + water)
* **Coconut water** is your best friend
* **Avoid** sugary sports drinks ...  they spike, then crash you
* **Set timers** if you forget to drink  

# Sleep Hacks & Support Tools

You won’t sleep well at first. But there are *ways* to sleep better ...  or at least rest more deeply.

* **Routine matters** ...  same time every night
* **Dark, cool room** ...  blackout curtains, fan, no screens 1 hour before bed
* **Stack light**: magnesium + glycine + theanine > sedative overkill
* **Brown noise or audiobooks** instead of silence
* **Accept the wakefulness** ...  panic makes it worse  

# Essential Tools

* **Weighted blanket** (only if it doesn’t trigger your RLS)
* **Hot water bottle or heating pad** for cramps
* **Cold pack** for chest buzzing or anxiety
* **Cheap headphones** \+ comfort playlist = sanity
* **Notebook for tracking wins, cravings, mood** ...  yes, like a survivor log



What to Expect When You're Expecting Withdrawl:

# My Experience

For me, I tried the road of taper.

I’d love to say that I was able to go from a 10+ Feel Free Tonic intake a day, down to 6… 3… 1… then magically woke up the next day and was back to my normal, smiling, smart-assed self.

If I told you that, I’d be lying.And I’m not here to lie to you.

I’m here to share my experience and provide legit, helpful information to help you quit .. *in your own way.*

For me, tapering failed oh-so-miserably, especially when I was down to 2 or 3 bottles a day. Once that first Feel Free went down my gullet, that was it. There was no “just one more.” It was more like, “Okay, got my first one… now how can I scrape together enough money to get seven more?”

**To the couch cushions I gooooo!**

After trying and failing miserably a few times, I finally started listening to my body. Here’s what it told me:

*“Hey stupid. You know I can’t just do one or two of these things, right? You give me one, I’m going to demand you feed me moooore, Seymour!!”*

So I made the decision to sever the cord. Fully. Completely.**Cold turkey was the only way I was going to make this work!**



# Chapter 2: The Timeline of Withdrawal

No matter how you quit ...  cold turkey or taper ...  you're going to go through some **shit**! And the hardest part? It doesn’t happen all at once. Kratom withdrawal is a shapeshifter. Just when you think you’re in the clear… it pivots (PIVOT!!! Did you read that in Ross’s Voice?). Sharp.

Everyone’s timeline is different, but there *is* a general rhythm to the madness.

Let’s walk through it ...  not just with charts and facts, but with blood, sweat, and bed-ridden confessions.



# Day 1... 3: The Physical War

This is the part that hits the hardest, fastest, and lowest. Your body is confused, pissed off, and wondering why its steady stream of artificial serotonin and dopamine has been replaced by soup, crying, and a cold toilet seat.

Common symptoms:

* Restless legs like they’re possessed
* Insomnia that laughs at melatonin and even Ambien
* Hot/cold sweats on repeat
* Muscle aches, joint pain
* Diarrhea, stomach cramps
* Zero appetite, but infinite nausea
* Racing heart and “zappy” nerve feelings  



# Day 4... 10: The Emotional Fallout

The physical pain starts to *shift*, but that doesn’t mean it lets go. It just brings friends.

Enter the brain fog, the dread, and the weird emotional see-saws where one second you’re sobbing, and the next you feel... absolutely nothing.

Common symptoms:

* Anxiety, often crushing
* Depression, numbness
* Crying fits for no reason
* Random rage triggers
* Exhaustion without sleep
* Loss of hope and identity
* Panic over never feeling ""normal"" again

# My Experience (Timeline of Withdrawal)

**Days 1... 11: Cold Turkey from 10+ Bottles of Feel Free**

Okay, look. I’m going to be dead honest with you here.

The first three days of cold turkey? You’ll most likely relapse.**I did. More than once.**

You have to *want* this. Not because your girlfriend or wife wants it. Not because your friends, parents, or even your dog wants it for you. The only way you’ll succeed at quitting ...  cold turkey *or* taper ...  is if **you** want to quit. Period.

**How did I finally get to the point where withdrawal felt better than relapse?**I hit rock bottom. I was broke. Self-isolated. I’d almost lost everything ...  friends, family, relationships. And then I had a thought:

*What if something happened to my family tomorrow? My parents? My wife? Would they leave this life thinking their son, their husband, was just… an addict? Would their last thoughts be of* ***worry*** *instead of peace?*

It’s dark, I know. But that’s what cracked me.

# Day One

All-consuming. Not getting my daily dose(s) of Feel Free was the *only* thing I could think about. The cravings hijacked every thought..and then came night.

My heart was racing. My whole body buzzed like an electrified fence. Not just my legs ...  my chest, arms, everything. Jerking, shifting, squirming, crying… all of it. All night.

**Sleep? Not a chance.** Not one sheep jumped over a fence. The whole damn barn was empty. 24 hours. Zero sleep.

  


# Day Two

You know those tiered subscription plans? Bronze, Silver, Gold? If Day One was the Bronze Package of Sadness, Day Two was Silver. **“Everything you get with Bronze, PLUS the following…”**

* Violent, creeping anxiety. Not the “I’m nervous about a party I’m going to where I don't know anyone, so I’ll just sit on the floor and become besties with the dog” kind. The “my soul is being strangled by invisible fingers made of pure panic” kind.
* The mental game got harder. I had to change up my routine, avoiding my usual kratom stops.
* Nausea. Stomach cramps. Vomit that wouldn’t stop. *Vomitus Maximus, will have my revenge, in this life or the next...*
* My legs? They turned into one of those inflatable wacky waving arm guys from sketchy car dealerships. They. Would. Not. Stop.  

And the chest buzz… it ramped up. Then came the *impending doom*. Like you’re about to die. For real. You start mentally picking out clothes for your own funeral.**48 hours. Still no sleep.**

# Day Three

After 48 hours without sleep, your brain starts glitching.

* Good luck in that work meeting.
* Or operating that forklift.
* Or remembering what the hell you were doing 30 seconds ago.  

This day was pure joint pain. My back felt like it was caving in. Anxiety, depression, a loud inner voice whispering things like:

*“You know, if you just dose… all this goes away.”*

*“Don’t you think you deserve to sleep?”*

**TELL THAT VOICE TO FUCK OFF**.\*\* It’s a lie. It’s a trap!

Because yeah, one dose and the pain *does* fade ...  but only for now.Then the timer resets. Back to Day One. And this time, you’ll bring shame, regret, and self-loathing with you. *All of it* adds weight to the next attempt.

So stay strong. Stay angry. Stay focused.You’ve already made it further than you think.

***You. Got. This.***

# My Experience

**Day 11 ...  The Ambush**

I was on my 11th day being completely free from any kratom, kava ...  hell, I even gave my morning coffee the bombastic side-eye, wondering if it would betray me and throw me back into the pit. I was careful. Like, obsessive-compulsive, careful.

So imagine my surprise when, on the night of Day 11, I started feeling like it was Night One all over again.

It started with that familiar buzzing in my chest. “Uh-oh.”

Buzzing turned to anxiety. Anxiety jacked up my heart rate. The pounding heart triggered panic. The panic unlocked full-body restlessness.

And just like that, I was lying there wondering:

*“Did I somehow accidentally dose and not realize it?”*

Spoiler: I didn’t. It was a rebound **withdrawal.** (Yes that’s a real thing)

I tried a hot shower .. nothing.Tried a cold shower.. Now I just felt like a *sad, insane Eskimo*.

My vitamin stack? Might as well have been empty gel capsules.Nothing worked.

I was exhausted. Broken. Scared.But mostly? **Pissed.**

I did everything *right*. All the steps. In all the right order.And here I was ...  back at square one… or so I *thought*.

Turns out, it wasn’t square one. It was just my body throwing a sneaky, last-ditch tantrum.A biochemical ambush designed to trick me into giving it what it craved.

I didn’t fall for it.

I stayed strong.I stayed the course.And unfortunately… I stayed awake.

# What You Need to Know Right Now

1. **You are NOT back at Day One.**It just *feels* that way. Your nervous system is still healing ...  and this is part of the repair process. Think of it like phantom pain after a wound starts to scab. It sucks, but it means the system is still reconfiguring itself.  
2. **Don’t undo your progress.**This is the devil whispering, “Just one and you’ll feel better.” But one bottle = full reset. These rebound days are temporary. Dosing just starts the entire cycle over.  
3. **Write it down.**Track these days. Log them. See the patterns. Next time it hits, you’ll know it’s a *flare*, not a failure.  
4. **Hydrate, eat clean, rest aggressively.**Even if you’re shaking, even if you can’t sleep ...  **lay down**. Even rest counts. Your nervous system needs calm to keep rewiring.  
5. **Reach out.**You are not meant to battle rebound days alone. Talk to someone. Text a friend. Or scream into a void ...  like this book.
6.   



**This is the part where people relapse ...  not because they’re weak, but because they didn’t see the second wave coming.** You *did*. So now you’re armed. Stay angry. Stay stubborn. **You’re not starting over. You’re leveling up.**



# Chapter 4: Physical Demons

Withdrawal isn’t just “feeling a little off” or “needing a nap.” It’s your entire body rebelling ...  systems shutting down, alarms blaring, and everything suddenly deciding to either ache, burn, twitch, or melt.

Some symptoms are expected. Others? You’ll be Googling stuff like:

*“Buzzing chest kratom withdrawal heart attack?”* *“Is it normal to feel like I’m going to die from Kratom withdrawal?”*

So let’s name them. Describe them. And most importantly ...  tell you what the hell to *do* about them.

# Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) ...  aka My personal Demon

**What helps:**

* Hot Epsom salt baths
* Magnesium glycinate or citrate
* Weighted blankets (if you can tolerate pressure)
* Stretching, pacing, or punching a pillow while cursing kratom’s name ***→ Full supplement stack coming in Chapter 7***  



# Insomnia ...  aka The Endless Night

**What helps:**

* Melatonin (low dose: 0.3mg... 1mg ...  not 10mg, you maniac)
   * Be aware, Melatonin may make your RLS worse, it does for me)
* Magnesium, passionflower, glycine
* Audiobooks or brown noise loops
   * Music. Play your favorites, play something you never heard, PLAY ANYTHING
* *Accepting* the night instead of fighting it ...  rest is still progress ***→ Full supplement stack coming in Chapter 7***  





# Digestive Mayhem

**What helps:**

* Stay hydrated ...  add electrolytes like Liquid IV or coconut water
* Bland food only (toast, rice, applesauce, broth, Yogurt)
* Ginger tea or peppermint capsules
* Avoid dairy, sugar, caffeine (yes, even if you cry inside) ***→ Full supplement stack coming in Chapter 7***  

# Sweats, Chills, and Temperature Chaos

**What helps:**

* Layered clothing so you can strip or bundle up
* Lukewarm showers ...  too hot or cold might backfire
* Hydration, again. Seriously. DRINK. THE. WATER. ***→ Full supplement stack coming in Chapter 7***  



# Electric Buzzing / Chest Vibration

**What helps:**

* Deep breathing (box breathing: 4 in, hold 4, 4 out, hold 4)
* Cold compress on chest
* Walking it off ...  movement can short-circuit the hum
* CBD can help some (but go light ...  don’t trade one crutch for another) ***→ Full supplement stack coming in Chapter 7***  



# Pain Flare-Ups (Back, Joints, Nerves)

**What helps:**

* NSAIDs like ibuprofen (if your stomach can handle it)
* Heating pads, topical pain creams
* Gentle stretching or restorative yoga
* Distraction ...  pain screams louder when you’re doing nothing ***→ Full supplement stack coming in Chapter 7***

# Chapter 5: The Mind Maze

If the physical symptoms of withdrawal feel like a prison, the *mental* ones feel like a haunted house built inside your own skull ...  where every room has a new horror waiting just behind every new door.

And just like any good haunted house, the worst part is: **none of it’s real**…But that doesn’t stop it from feeling *very, very real*.

This chapter isn’t meant to scare you. It’s meant to validate what you’re feeling and expose the lies your brain tells you while it’s rewiring itself.



# Impending Doom (for No Reason)

You’re not dying.Repeat, you ARE NOT dying…I promise.Your family isn’t cursed.There’s no disaster on the horizon.

But your brain? It’s convinced you’ve been *marked for death*.

This is withdrawal’s favorite trick ...  an irrational sense of dread that settles over your chest like a weighted blanket made of anxiety and shadow. You can’t point to a cause, but your body reacts like the Grim Reaper is in the room staring at you…waiting for you.

**What helps:**

* Grounding exercises (touch 5 things, name 4, etc.)  
* Remind yourself: *“This is withdrawal. It’s not real.”*  
* Cold water on the face or wrists.  
* Movement ...  anxiety doesn’t like oxygen *→ Mental support supplements in Chapter 7*  



# Crying Fits (for Every Reason or No Reason at All)

One minute you’re fine. The next you’re sobbing because you saw a commercial with a dog… or remembered something kind your Mum said to you in 2002.

Crying is good. It’s your body *detoxing emotions*.Let it happen ...  it’s not a weakness. It’s a release.

**What helps:**

* Cry. Seriously. Cry it out.
* Journal if you’re up to it
* Hug something (yes, even a pillow)
* Music that hits ...  then lifts *→ Dopamine rebuild strategies in Chapter 9*  



# Emotional Numbness

Sometimes the opposite hits. You don’t feel *anything*. Not happy. Not sad. Just… flat. Like you’re watching your life on an old 1980’s television.

This freaks people out ...  especially after a few good days. But it’s common. Your brain is re-learning how to feel without chemical help. Give it time.

**What helps:**

* Novelty (new music, walks, comedy, creativity)
* Talking to someone ...  even if you “don’t care” at first
* Light exercise, natural light, dopamine-rich foods *→ See Chapter 9 for Dopamine Reboot*  





# Rage Out of Nowhere

Have you ever screamed at your coffee maker?Punch a wall?Snap at someone and immediately regret it?

Welcome to the rage phase. Your nerves are raw, and your tolerance for bullshit is at negative 50. But here's the kicker: **a lot of this anger is** ***grief in disguise*** ...  grief over what you lost, what you went through, and how long it took to get here.

**What helps:**

* Walk it off. Literally.
* Breathwork or yelling *into* a pillow
* Avoid heavy confrontation ...  it’ll pass
* Try to channel the rage into action (clean, organize, plan) *→ See Chapter 11 for Emotional Hangover*  

# Depression & Apathy

This is the big one. The one that sticks around long after the nausea fades. You might feel like nothing matters. That you’re broken. That joy is something other people get, but not you.

That’s not true ...  that’s withdrawal lying to your face.

Your brain’s dopamine systems are in reboot. Joy *will* return. But in the meantime, even the smallest victories matter.

**What helps:**

* Win something daily (make the bed, take a walk, survive)
* Structure your day ...  free-floating time makes it worse
* Don’t isolate. Even texting “hey” to a friend helps
* Time. Time. Time. *→ Full healing roadmap starts in Chapter 9*



# My Experience (The Mind Maze)

**The Rage Phase**

There were moments ...  *many* ...  where I wanted to kick a puppy or sling a kitten into a microwave. (Okay, that was a bit much ...  but you know what I’m saying.)

The anger was real.Not directed at anyone, really. Mostly at *myself*.

*“How could I be so stupid to let this happen?”* *“Why am I going through this? It’s not fair. It’s so fucking dumb!”*

But you know something? Every day I go without reaching for that little blue bottle… I understand a little more.

No ...  I don’t necessarily **deserve** what I’m going through.But I do have to accept that my actions played a role.**I am reaping what I’ve sown.**

That doesn’t mean I chased a high.I chased *relief* ...  from constant, all-consuming pain.

**What I got instead was a professionally marketed lie.**

Kratom and Feel Free weren’t handed to me by some sketchy dude in a back alley.They were sold to me by wellness influencers ...  beautiful people on beaches, holding bottles like salvation.  
  


They said it would save me from prescription pain meds, from anxiety, from alcohol.**I** ***bought*** **that lie.**

And while it was my responsibility to stop sooner than I did…

**My responsibility now is to make sure I don’t fall for those lies again.** And maybe ...  just maybe ...  help someone else avoid the same trap I fell into.

# Chapter 6: The Cravings Are Lying to You

If withdrawal is the war, cravings are the propaganda.

They don’t scream. They whisper.They don’t attack. They *negotiate*.They’ll wear a thousand different faces, all to convince you that **you’re not really relapsing** ...  you’re just “making an informed choice” in a really hard moment.

*“One more time, then I’m done for real this time”“You’ve earned it after what you’ve been through today. Don’t you think you deserve it?.”“You’re stronger now ...  you can control it this time. You know you can!”*

**Bullshit. All of it!**

Cravings are your brain’s attempt to restore what it *thinks* it needs to survive. They are not the truth ...  they’re echoes of dependency, dressed in logic and nostalgia.



# Understanding Psychological Cravings

This isn’t just willpower. This is *chemistry*. Your brain was trained ...  one hit of dopamine at a time ...  to associate kratom or Feel Free with comfort, calm, energy, or relief.

So now? It doesn’t care that you’ve quit. It just wants that comfort back. That dopamine hit. That *synthetic normal feeling of peace*.

Psychological cravings often show up when:

* You’re tired
* You’re bored
* You’re stressed
* You’re around triggers (people, places, smells, music)
* You’re feeling *too good* and want to “celebrate”  

Yes ...  sometimes the most dangerous craving is when you *finally* feel okay and the brain goes:

*“This would be the perfect time for a little reward...”*



# Common Craving Lies

* *“You’re not addicted anymore ...  one won’t hurt.”*
* *“You’re already miserable. Might as well. (This was one i often fell for)”*
* *“It wasn’t that bad, was it?”*
* *“You functioned fine on it. You’re better ON it. (Another strong one that got me)”*
* *“This isn't a relapse. It’s maintenance.”*  

If you’re thinking these thoughts ...  *you’re in the craving zone*. That’s not you talking. That’s withdrawal… A dark Mimic or your own thoughts, don't engage with it.





# What Helps: Craving Disruption Tools

When a craving hits, you don’t fight it with logic. You fight it with **interruptions**.

1. **Distraction & Action**
   * Clean something. Fold laundry. Take a cold shower.  
   * Movement shoves cravings to the back burner.  
2. **Delay**  
   * Give yourself 20 minutes. Find something to do in that time that isn’t dosing!  
   * Most cravings peak and fade fast ...  if you survive the wave, it passes.  
3. **De-romanticize**  
   * Make a *truth list*:
      1. “It wrecked my sleep.”
      2.  “It cost me friendships.”
      3.  “It wasn’t fun. It was survival.”
   * Read it when cravings hit. Read it *out loud.*  
4. **Talk to someone**  
   * Even if it’s a quick “meme text” to your best friend.  
   * Craving’s fear connection. Do not isolate yourself. Be strong, and get out there in the world if you're physically able to. It will help!.  
5. **Change your scenery**  
   * Get out of your house. Go for a drive.  
   * If your brain is trying to drag you back, *drag it somewhere new.*  



# Chapter 7: The Survival Checklist

You’ve made it this far, and if you’re reading this chapter, congrats ...  you’re either in the fire or walking straight into it like a pissed-off Terminator. This is where we stop white-knuckling and start *strategizing*.

Because surviving withdrawal isn’t just about gritting your teeth. It’s about **supporting your system** so it can do its job: heal.

This chapter covers:

* The supplement stack (and when to take what)  
* Hydration & electrolytes  
* Sleep support  
* Practical tools to reduce suffering *without* setting you back  



# Chapter 8: Food That Helps You Heal

Here’s the thing nobody tells you when you’re knee-deep in withdrawal:**Your brain is starving.**Not just for dopamine… but for *real food*.

For months (or years), kratom and/or Feel Free have been doing the heavy lifting. Now it’s on you ...  and your body’s freaking out like a spoiled toddler who didn’t get their way! So let’s talk about what actually helps heal the damage.

**No fad diets. No kale-crap salads. Just science-backed, practical fuel.**





# Neurorepair Nutrition 101

Your brain and nervous system rely on *real nutrients* to rebuild. That means:

* **Protein = Power**
* **Why**: Amino acids are the building blocks for neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin.
* **Sources**: Eggs, chicken, salmon, Greek yogurt, tofu, tempeh, whey protein if you can stomach it.

# Bonus tip: Eat protein with breakfast to stabilize your mood early.



# Healthy Fats = Brain Lube

* **Why**: Your brain is mostly fat. Feed it what it needs to rebuild.
* **Sources**: Avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil, fatty fish (salmon, sardines), nut butters.  

# Complex Carbs = Steady Mood

* **Why**: Carbs help with serotonin production and prevent crashes.
* **Sources**: Oats, quinoa, brown rice, sweet potatoes, lentils, beans.

# Avoid: White bread, sugary cereals, candy. They spike and drop you.

# 



# Antioxidants = Anti-Crash

* **Why**: Withdrawal causes inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.
* **Sources**: Berries, leafy greens, turmeric, dark chocolate (yes, *real* chocolate), green tea.  

# Hydration Still Matters

* Water. Broth. Herbal teas.
* You’re still flushing toxins ...  keep the engine clean.  



# Foods to Avoid

Some things will make symptoms *worse*, or just trigger emotional craziness. Here’s your try to avoid list (for now, not forever):

* **Sugar** ...  emotional rollercoaster fuel
* **Caffeine overload** ...  may worsen anxiety, chest buzzing, or insomnia
* **Diary (for some)** ...  can cause bloating and brain fog
* **Alcohol** ...  don’t even get me started. You’re not replacing one demon with another  





# What Actually Helps You Feel Human

Some comfort foods are more than just comforting ...  they actually *regulate* you.

Try a combination of these:

* **Bone broth with rice and avocado** ...  warm, nourishing, full of minerals
* **Scrambled eggs with spinach** ...  fast protein + brain greens
* **Smoothie with banana, berries, flax, protein powder, almond butter**
* **Peanut butter toast with honey and sea salt**
* **Sweet potato + black beans + a splash of olive oil and lemon**

# My Experience

I’m not gonna pretend I’m some wellness influencer with professional meal prepper and had a fridge full of chia seeds.

Truth is, I lived off apples, bananas, and protein powder. That’s it. It wasn’t pretty, but it was easy to keep down, didn’t wreck my gut, and gave me just enough energy to make it to the next day.

You don’t need perfection ...  you need *something*.

 Keep it simple. Keep it real. Keep moving forward.



# Chapter 9: Dopamine Reboot ...  How to Feel Joy Again

Let’s be honest.

There’s a point in withdrawal where you stop begging for the pain to end and start asking an even scarier question:

**“Am I ever going to feel** ***normal*** **again?”**

Not just not being in pain ...  but *alive*.

Not just functioning ...  but laughing.

Not just surviving ...  but actually giving a shit about something again.

If you’re there, this chapter’s for you.

Because here’s the hard truth:

When you quit kratom or Feel Free, your **dopamine system is wrecked**.

The thing that used to bring joy ...  coffee, games, music, hugs, *life* ...  now feels like a grayscale version of itself. And you start to wonder if this is just how it’s going to be forever.

Spoiler: **It’s not.**But it takes work. It takes *rewiring*. And it takes *you*.



# The Science (Real Quick, I Promise)

Dopamine is your **motivation** and **reward** neurotransmitter.It’s not just about pleasure ...  it’s what makes you *care*.

Kratom and kava hijack your dopamine and opioid receptor systems.They flood them. Artificially.

Your brain, being the overly dramatic genius that it is, notices this and goes:

*“Whoa, way too much of that good stuff. Better shut down production.”*

So now? You’re off the Kratom, no more Kava...  and your brain’s dopamine factories are still on strike. That’s why everything feels flat, heavy, or stupid.

This is called **dopamine downregulation**, and while it *can* last a while, it’s reversible.



# How to Reboot the Circuit

We’re not chasing spikes anymore. We’re chasing steady power ...  the slow restoration of motivation, laughter, and meaning.

# 1. Movement = Dopamine in Motion

You don’t need a gym membership. You need gravity and a reason.

* Walk. Even just around your block. Even in silence.
* Light stretching or yoga counts.
* Bodyweight stuff like pushups or wall sits can help “reclaim” your body.
* Bonus: Morning movement boosts dopamine *and* resets circadian rhythm.  

**Pro tip**: Pair walking with music or a podcast. **Double up the dopamine.**



# 2. Music That Hits You Right in the Feels

Music is one of the few things that can **bypass the broken system** and still activate reward centers.

Not just “feel good” music ...  but *music that makes you feel anything*.

For me, that was My Chemical Romance.For someone else, it’s 90s grunge. Or lo-fi. Or an angry Irish folk song. It doesn’t matter, just play what you love!.

Make a playlist. Call it “**Still Breathing**.” Or “**Songs That Hit Differently**” Or “**Soundtrack to My Comeback**.”

You’ll cry to it. Rage to it. Feel *something* through it. That’s the point.



# 3. Connection & Laughter

Even if you feel like a ghost, *connect anyway*.Your brain wants to shut down and hide. That’s how it stays stuck.

1. Text a friend. Even just a meme.
2. Watch stand-up comedy ...  let yourself laugh at something dumb.
3. Call someone and talk about *anything but kratom*.
4. Share your struggle with someone who won’t try to “fix” you.  

**Every single connection builds new neural pathways.** Even if you’re faking it at first. Fake laughs *still count*.



# 4. Novelty = The Brain’s Favorite Drug

This is huge.

Novelty ...  new experiences, sights, sounds, sensations ...  is a direct dopamine stimulant.

That doesn’t mean skydiving, or base-jumping you crazy bastard, settle down. It means:

1. Taking a different route to work
2. Rearranging your room
3. Trying a new food
4. Listening to a new genre of music
5. Watching a movie from a country you’ve never been to  

**Novelty + Movement + Music = triple dopamine boost**

Your brain *wants* to re-engage with the world. You just have to trick it into remembering how.



# 5. Create Something (Even If It’s Bad)

1. Write. Draw. Build. Doodle. Cook.
2. Play a stupid mobile game. Organize your books by color. Name your houseplants.
3. Make a dumb goal: “Today I will take three weird photos of puddles.”  

Creation is *the antidote to destruction*. Even if you make garbage. Especially if you make garbage.



# 6. Track Wins. No Matter How Small.

Withdrawal warps time. You’ll forget how far you’ve come unless you *document it*.

1. Keep a journal (doesn’t need to be fancy)
2. Make a “Done” list instead of a “To-Do” list
3. Take a photo of yourself once a week

Celebrate weird milestones: “Didn’t scream at my coffee machine ...  Day 4.” “Didn’t check Feel Free’s price today...  Day 11.” “Took a walk and didn’t cry about it ...  Day 19.”  
  


This rewires your reward system *in real time.*



 **What** ***Doesn’t*** **Help the Reboot**

Let’s be honest about this, too:

* Doom scrolling on TikTok
* Energy drinks instead of meals
* Isolating in your room like a crypt keeper
* Comparing yourself to the fake “day 90 miracle” Reddit stories  

If it *feels* like a dopamine spike but leaves you feeling worse… it’s not helping.



# Chapter 10: Post-Acute Withdrawal (PAWS)

*“This is supposed to be over… so why do I still feel broken?”*

Welcome to the next big lie kratom withdrawal tells you:

**That once the physical symptoms fade, you’ll magically be yourself again.**

What they don’t tell you ...  what nobody told *me* ...  is that the next few weeks and months can feel *worse*, in some ways, than the first few.

Not as intense (Thankfully). Not as scary. (Praise >Insert God of choice here<) But more **empty**, **frustrating**, and **slow**.



# What Is PAWS, Really?

**PAWS** stands for **Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome** ...  and it’s the phase of recovery that kicks in *after* acute withdrawal ends (usually after Day 10... 14). Arn’t we lucky, we get PHASES of withdrawal.

It’s caused by your brain’s chemical systems still rebalancing:

* Dopamine (motivation, reward)
* Serotonin (mood, emotional regulation)
* GABA (calm, sleep)
* Norepinephrine (focus, energy)  

During this time, you’re no longer in crisis mode ...  but you’re definitely *not fine*. Think of it like emotional jet lag: your system is rebooting in the background, and it takes time, rest, and *patience*.



# Common PAWS Symptoms

These aren’t random. They come in **waves**. You might have a good day, then three terrible ones, then another decent morning… followed by a crash.

# 1. Depression

* Low mood without obvious cause
* Hopelessness, even after a few good days
* Emotional numbness ...  like nothing matters  

# 2. Anxiety

* Low-level, chronic worry or dread
* Social anxiety you didn’t used to have
* Physical symptoms: tight chest, racing heart, buzzing  

# 3. Mood Swings

* Crying over nothing, then angry 20 minutes later
* Feeling okay, then suddenly overwhelmed
* Disproportionate reactions to minor triggers  

# 4. Lack of Motivation

* No drive to work, clean, eat, shower, move
* Everything feels like climbing a mountain in mud
* Even stuff you *used* to enjoy feels pointless  

# 5. Brain Fog & Poor Focus

* Hard to read, follow conversations, or finish tasks
* Memory lapses ...  “What was I doing again?”
* Mental exhaustion from doing “normal” things  

# 6. Fatigue

* Sleep isn’t refreshing
* Your energy feels *flat* or unstable
* The smallest task drains you  

# 7. Cravings (Again)

* Sneaky thoughts like: *“You’re not getting better.”* *“Just go back. You were more functional before.”* *“This isn’t worth it.”“You deserve to feel like you did…why do this to yourself?”*  



# Why It Happens (The Deep Dive)

Kratom and kava alter how your brain regulates stress, pleasure, and reward. When you quit, your receptors are damaged, sluggish, or desensitized.

But rebuilding takes time. Neuroplasticity (your brain’s ability to rewire) is a **slow burn**.

Think:

* **Weeks** for neurotransmitter function to stabilize  
* **Months** for emotional regulation to feel natural again  
* Even **a year** for some people to fully reclaim joy and clarity  

This isn’t permanent damage.It’s *delayed healing*.

But most people relapse during this window because they think the worst is over ...  and get blindsided by the emotional slump.



#  How to Survive PAWS

There’s no magic pill. But there *are* tools that make it bearable ...  and even healing.

# 1. Expect It

* Know the waves are coming
* Track your mood patterns (weekly, not daily)
* Use a calendar or journal ...  note “bad days” and look for trends  

# 2. Create Structure

* No “free-floating” days
* Build a simple routine: wake, eat, move, rest
* Keep appointments. Keep promises. Stay in motion  

# 3. Fuel Your Brain

* Revisit Chapter 8: Eat. Hydrate. Supplement.
* Don’t skip meals. Low blood sugar = emotional chaos
* Protein, complex carbs, healthy fats = brain repair  

# 4. Keep Moving (Even When It Sucks)

* Walk every day
* Movement = dopamine and serotonin production
* Force the motion ...  the feelings follow  

# 5. Stop Waiting to ""Feel Like It""

* Motivation *follows* action
* Waiting until you feel better = staying stuck
* Do the thing anyway ...  even badly  

# 6. Connect, Even Shallowly

* Text someone a meme
* Talk to a barista
* Post in a support group
* Even *casual* interaction helps repair emotional circuits  

# 7. Avoid Isolation Traps

* Don’t binge media 10 hours a day
* Don’t spend all day in your bed or cave
* Get outside daily ...  even 5 minutes of sunlight matters  

# 8. Celebrate Wins. Any Wins.

* Showered today? Win.
* Didn’t cry until 4 p.m.? Win.
* Cooked your own food? Win.

Stayed sober one more day? **Massive win.**",1,1749491769.0,Quittingfeelfree,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best spa and body scrubs offer a harmonious blend of exfoliating agents, nourishing ingredients, and delightful textures. Here's what to look for when choosing your perfect scrub:

**Exfoliating Particles:** the type and size of exfoliating particles substantially impact the scrub's effectiveness. Options range from natural ingredients like sugar, salt, coffee grounds, and fruit seeds to synthetic beads.Sugar scrubs are generally gentler and dissolve in water, making them suitable for sensitive skin. Salt scrubs offer a more vigorous exfoliation,ideal for thicker skin and areas like elbows and knees. Coffee grounds provide a stimulating effect, while fruit seeds offer a more eco-conscious and biodegradable option.

The size of the particles also matters.Smaller particles provide a gentler, more even exfoliation, while larger particles offer a more intense scrub. Consider your skin's sensitivity and the level of exfoliation you desire when selecting a scrub based on its particle type and size.**Base Oils and Moisturizers:** A high-quality body scrub shouldn't just strip away dead skin cells; it should also nourish and hydrate the skin. Look for scrubs formulated with beneficial base oils like coconut oil, jojoba oil, almond oil, or shea butter. These oils help to moisturize and soften the skin, leaving it feeling smooth and supple after exfoliation. Humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid draw moisture into the skin, further enhancing hydration.

The inclusion of these ingredients ensures that your skin doesn't feel dry or tight after scrubbing. Opt for scrubs that prioritize natural and organic oils to minimize the risk of irritation and maximize the benefits for your skin.

**Aromatherapy and Essential Oils:** The scent of a body scrub can significantly enhance the overall spa experience. Many scrubs are infused with essential oils that not only provide a pleasant aroma but also offer therapeutic benefits. lavender is known for its calming and relaxing properties, while citrus scents like grapefruit and orange can be energizing and uplifting. Eucalyptus and peppermint can help to clear sinuses and invigorate the senses.

Consider your mood and desired effect when choosing a scrub based on its scent. Opt for natural essential oils rather than synthetic fragrances to avoid potential skin irritation.**Added Benefits: Vitamins and Antioxidants:** Some advanced body scrubs go beyond basic exfoliation and hydration by incorporating vitamins and antioxidants. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that helps to protect the skin from free radical damage, while vitamin C can brighten and even out skin tone. Ingredients like green tea extract and pomegranate extract also offer antioxidant benefits.

Choosing a scrub with added vitamins and antioxidants can provide extra nourishment and protection for your skin, helping to keep it healthy and radiant. These added components contribute to the long-term improvement of skin health.

**Texture and Request:** The texture of a body scrub should be pleasing and easy to work with.A good scrub should be thick enough to stay in place during application without being too difficult to spread. It should also rinse off easily without leaving a greasy residue. Consider if the scrub is a paste, oil based, or combines both for effective exfoliating and hydration.

The application process should be enjoyable and straightforward. Some scrubs are best applied in the shower, while others can be used in a bath or dry for a more intense exfoliation.

Individuals with keratosis pilaris (small, rough bumps on the skin) frequently enough find significant relief with regular use of a gentle exfoliating scrub.

**Enhanced Circulation:** The massaging action of applying a body scrub can stimulate blood flow and improve circulation. This can help to nourish skin cells and promote a healthy glow. Improved circulation can also help to reduce the appearance of cellulite by breaking down fat deposits and improving lymphatic drainage. Many users report feeling more energized and invigorated after using a body scrub, thanks to the increased circulation.

**Better Absorption of Other Products:** Exfoliating with a body scrub prepares the skin to better absorb other skincare products, such as moisturizers, serums, and sunscreens. By removing the barrier of dead skin cells,these products can penetrate deeper into the skin and deliver their active ingredients more effectively. This can significantly enhance the efficacy of your entire skincare routine,leading to improved results.Using a body scrub before applying self-tanner can also result in a more even and longer-lasting tan.

Seeing and feeling smoother, more radiant skin can instantly improve your mood and overall confidence, encourage self love and a dedication to a regular skincare routine.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of spa and body scrubs can bring up a number of questions. Here are some answers to common queries:

**How often should I use a body scrub?**
The frequency of body scrub use depends on your skin type and the intensity of the scrub. Generally, exfoliating 1-3 times per week is sufficient for most people. Individuals with sensitive skin should start with once a week and gradually increase frequency as tolerated. over-exfoliating can lead to irritation and dryness, so it's significant to listen to your skin and adjust accordingly.

**Can I use a body scrub on my face?**
While some body scrubs are gentle enough to be used on the face, it's generally best to use a product specifically formulated for facial skin. Facial skin is much more delicate than body skin, and many body scrubs contain harsher particles that can irritate or damage the face. If you choose to use a body scrub on your face, test it on a small area first and use a very light touch.

**Are all-natural scrubs better for the environment?**
All-natural scrubs are often considered better for the environment, as they avoid the use of synthetic ingredients like microbeads, which can pollute waterways and harm marine life. Opting for scrubs made with biodegradable ingredients like sugar, salt, coffee grounds, or fruit seeds can definitely help to minimize your environmental impact. Additionally, look for brands that use sustainable packaging and ethical sourcing practices.

**Can body scrubs help with ingrown hairs?**
Yes, regular exfoliation with a body scrub can definitely help to prevent ingrown hairs by removing dead skin cells that can trap hairs beneath the surface. This is especially helpful in areas were you shave or wax. Use a gentle circular motion to exfoliate the area and help to release any trapped hairs. Follow up with a moisturizing lotion to keep skin soft and supple.

It's insulated. The size is just right for me. It's suitable for carrying during sports, and it's also great for taking coffee with me when going out.

CK underwear.
It's really beyond my expectations. It's made of 100% pure cotton!

Adidas socks.
The quality is really good. They are softer than I expected, and they are a great choice.

Denim shorts.
I have to say that the texture of these denim shorts is top-notch. They fit me perfectly. The stitching and the workmanship of the zipper are excellent, and the color is very sophisticated. I can make a lot of different outfits with them.

ADWYSD pants.
To be honest, I wasn't really interested in black denim pants originally. Since the price was so good, I picked one up by the way. But I was so surprised when I got it. The texture is very high-end. It's a straight-leg denim pant and it's very comfortable. I've changed my opinion of this brand.

GD blue T.
No surprises. It performs steadily as always. The print is made of rubber.

GD black denim shorts.
This style has been on my shopping list for a long time, but I didn't really like it when I got the actual item. It's too tight, and the size runs small for me.

RHUDE T.
This color is perfect for summer. The size I bought fits me very well, and it looks great on me. The texture of the shirt is just right, not too thick.

Acne studios black T.
The cutting of the shirt is just so so, but the texture is good. I don't think it looks as good as in the picture, but luckily it's not expensive.

Acne studios.
This is definitely a qualified white Tee. Both the texture and the workmanship are top-notch. I think I'll wear it quite often.

Acne studios white long T.
Just like the black one, I don't really like this one either.

Supreme black T.
It's of high quality, but the logo is not reflective.

Sunglasses.
I prepared these sunglasses for my trip. I think they are quite good.

Saint T.
It has a special color. The print with the donut makes the overall color look very pleasant. Most importantly, the price is really good, so it's a great choice.

RHUDE black T.
Compared to the other one, this one has the classic big logo. It goes well with everything, and the texture is also top notch.

1l7bfox,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1l7bfox/something_interesting_i_realized_about_blood/,Something interesting I realized about Blood Sacrifice and the Shredder/Auto-Axe,"I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but just in case no one has, I'm going to talk about it here.

So, everyone knows that if you use an Auto-Axe or Shredder, it uses up your AP bar to keep going. When you run out of AP, or don't have enough, it automatically stops. Simple and why Canned Coffee used to be the most sought after consumable for Melee Ghouls before they got a full set of Rejuvenators to offset the cost. However, Rejuv is Power Armor only, so if you were a Melee Ghoul or human melee  character wanting to use a non-PA build, then you're out of luck unless you had a huge stack of Canned Coffee saved up.

This brings me to my discovery. For those that haven't checked it out, Blood Sacrifice changed to use your HP instead of your AP for VATs hits, but the weapon shots cost 50% more. Notice how I said it's only usable in VATs. If it can only be used with VATs, then...why does it work with the Auto-Axe or Shredder outside of it? I'm not sure, as I'm not a programmer or a an expert. But, I believe that the Auto-Axe and Shredder share a similar system that lets you attack in VATs. If I'm wrong, someone can correct me on this.

But why is this important? Why bring up a rather unique, albeit sort of worthless change? Because if I'm correct, this could help Non-PA human/ghoul melee characters alike. Unlike AP, HP has various ways to regen, both in and out of combat. Allow me to explain.

While I'm not sure if my math is correct, if you use the Solar Armor as a Ghoul, equipped with Battle-Genes and a full set of Sawbones on the armor, you SHOULD be healing 13 HP per second. If you don't care about the feral buff, you can even get another 8 HP on kills and fill your feral meter with Action Diet. I'm not sure if this could offset the HP drain, as I don't have the Solar Armor, I'm unable to test this.

Alternatively, you could simply use Vampire's on the Auto-Axe/Shredder to offset the drain from Blood Sacrifice if you want to save your 4 star slots, don't have Solar Armor, or not a Ghoul so you can't use Action Diet or Battle-Genes. I do think this is the better and most efficient approach that can allow all Melee characters shred/axe almost infinitely. I merely mentioned the other option as a hypothetical in case you have a different 1 star in mind for the weapon if you want more damage.




TLDR: Blood Sacrifice allows Melee characters of all races to Auto-Axe near infinitely without worrying about running out of AP/HP if they don't want to use PA. Or if they don't have Rejuvs or any Canned Coffees lying around.

1l7bdz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LittleBoyCutYourHair/comments/1l7bdz5/just_sending_into_the_aether/,Just sending into the aether,"Talking to you was always pointless, but discovering that was harder than it should have been. 

You're so confident and self-assured. I'm not and ""don't love [myself]."" I'm often mistaken, I misunderstand, I'm bad at communicating. 

You look inwards, you reflect, you're deep and appreciate deepness. You know what you're good at, you're always striving to be better than you were. You know yourself and your intentions and your feelings and I need to retrofit that. You're patient and forgiving and have overlooked worse things than I'm able to. 

That's what you always said to me. All those things. 

Yet despite all your words, I know that my questions are all valid. If not for my emotions, my questions, my wanting to fight, you would have no clarity. There are no instances where you have reached out and of your own accord gone, ""I missed where I said this"" or ""I forgot and I see why this happened."" I always had to push and fight to get you to see or understand anything. You wouldn't have read the messages from December. You even screenshot and quoted them to argue with me and justify your decisions, only to say you ""didn't really read that"" later on. 

You don't remember when things happened in what order. It's whatever the bad is from me to justify your responses. And I believe you when you recount things. 

I have owned up to my mood swings and outbursts and unfair treatment. I apologized for Otaru, for Halloween, I brought up that I was unkind about *Princess Mononoke*—without you telling me to look back and look inward. I apologized. Yet you say that I rarely, if ever, apologize for things I've done. I believed that this was toxic because of *me*. Because you also reinforced that idea. At least I cared enough to try to walk away because I knew what I did wasn't healthy. 

I already felt bad enough for caring about your stupid relationship with your friends or you feeling appreciated on your birthday. Yeah, it was my fault I felt guilty and cried for how I planned that surprise party. You made sure I knew it was my own fault. You made sure I knew that I was stupid for even offering to buy you SushiStop or suggesting you break keto with it when you ""made clear what [you'd] break keto with. 

You didn't own up to deleting people off my FB until after I revealed that I knew you lied. Then you defend it, try to tell me you felt bad and you would have owned up to it. That it was a response sent because it was late and you were sleepy. The same person who talks at work about how he only sleeps 6 hours a week. Who can play games for 70 hours in a week and still think and function just fine. Who didn't send one message, but also sent one acting hurt and offended that I would ever even insinuate that you'd be capable of doing something like removing people from my friends list. And even when I said I know I should've removed them before, you use it to defend your actions and decisions—saying that I was overlooking the things they did. You let me reach out to them to ask them if they removed me.

You talk about wanting to end things with love and respect, but they're words from you about what you want from someone else. You doted on me when things were fine, and I've always appreciated that. I've thanked you. I've shown you the ways they've meant a lot to me. 

But the other people in my life did the same things. The same people you say you're not like. They baked me cookies shaped like Catbus, gave me cute gifts and coffee, would write cute notes, get me medicine and take care of me... And then lied to me, threatened me, gaslighted me, stalked me... 

None of them ever grabbed or held me down, though. None of them laid a hand on me or justified doing things I clearly wasn't okay with. None of them fought me when I tried to explain why moving me so it would look like I was cuddling them in my sleep, when I clearly was angry with them, wasn't okay—especially because it was followed up with trying to paint some warped description about how I was being loving and affectionate in my sleep. None of them tried to tell me that  *I* was sick because I discovered the action by pretending I was asleep, repeating in a mocking tone that I ""just let something I didn't want to happen happen because I just wanted to see."" You had the nerve to try and spin that on me instead of ""looking inward"" at how fucked up it is to do anything to someone in their sleep when you admitted they didn't even want to touch you when they were awake.

You say you'd do all these things and you just didn't know. But then I have to point out to you where I tried to make things known or where I tried to change. You insist you would realize things much later but then you argue about how you were ever going to see or understand the things I told you. Which is it? 

You say that caring about me was always your dominant goal and emotion, but you carelessly read things where I made it very clear I was in a dark place but still cared about you. You made it clear you had plans because of what you assumed I was saying when I invited you to a movie. You want to tell me that you would want nothing more than to spend time with me, but you don't want to flake out on plans you committed to before I could even say anything. I even said I'll see you on Christmas. I said I wanted you in Japan. If you want to say you didn't see that or didn't know, then what's the point of saying you weren't going to flake out unless you were trying to preemptively respond to an invitation? There was no need. You could have left it at you had already made plans. I've never once asked you to flake out on your friends, have I? 

You say you resigned yourself to an end. You say you never gave up, but you acted like it. Your reasoning and excuses talk about it. You sure as hell weren't ""fighting"" or trying. You couldn't commit to a trip I spent $10k on or even help plan it just a little. You were cleaning towards it"" based on how you saw my invitation to a movie, a week before the trip. Did you expect my mom to invite you to Christmas because you greeted *her* that day? That after she saw us fight, after she clearly heard me say that I didn't want you there, after she was even able to understand why I was upset, that you were still going to be treated like her ""son""? Like family? Because if I recall, you said my family wanting you there wouldn't have been enough for you to decide to go spend Christmas there anyway. So you do not get special treatment. 

You lie about little things like saying my sisters requested you as a friend on FB on their own. I know you sent the friend request. Are you trying to convince me they like you? That you have their approval? That they accepted you? Are you trying to convince yourself? 

The real difference between us is that I know where I fucked up, where I acted like shit, where I was wrong. I do actually reflect, I look inward, and I will come forward of my own accord to share these things and admit I was wrong. I actually fight to understand and be understood. I don't claim to completely understand someone or say I was patient or say I put up with more shit, because I know I haven't. I know I'm toxic, and I know I need to work on that before being with someone. I know where I tried and I fight for those things to be seen. 

You do none of those things. You wait. You say what you're doing isn't what you *want*, that you'd do so many things. But you don't. And you blame me for things undone or unsaid despite me telling you to do them. You have always sold yourself as someone who does everything and tries his best and doesn't give up and always seeks understanding—but do you?

Why is it that even if I was cold, when I saw you hurting about your friends ""treating [you] as second-rate,"" I actually did look inwards and tried to offer you love and support? I offered to drive to you so you could vent. Even when you coldly asked me what it mattered to me and what difference I thought I could make, I responded and said I didn't know if I could make a difference but that you were hurting and I wanted to support you. I gave you tenderness and love even if I could easily have taken your reactions as not wanting anything from me. 

But you? You claim to have thought of me as you decided me being a husk in a dark room and unresponsive was me telling you I didn't want your presence. Despite everything, I responded to your question of whether I wanted you on that trip as soon as I had anything in me to do so. The person who supposedly only cared and loved? ""I'm leaning towards the trip."" The pertain who supposedly would be there whenever I decided I wanted to see him? ""I made plans while you were just an unresponsive blob and I don't want to flake out even though I didn't even wait to hear if you had anything to say.""

I also got laid off. I was also at the end of a relationship. I didn't have people giving me referrals or reaching out or whatever. I know, based on my own actions, that I wouldn't have left you in that dark room on Christmas. I only did that after you showed me who you were. You say often how you know people. You talk about it a lot when you want to say you're picking up on something I do that's a trait or behavior pattern you're familiar with. But when you're wrong, it's because you've never met someone like me. I'm different and hard to figure out. So why isn't it wrong to make judgments and people and claim you know them when here I'm proving that you don't really?

The thing about telling you all this is that I already know your response. You'll deny certain things, tell me I've misunderstood you, that I'm wrong. That I've assumed. That I never understood you. That you know your own feelings, your own intentions. That I just want to see you a certain way and have my mind made up. That I only want to talk about or harp on these things and I've done worse and you did those things based on how I acted or what I wanted. But that doesn't excuse any of it. You'll say nothing you say or do matters, especially because I've indicated as much. But the real you uses that as an excuse to not even try. You always have. You haven't heard or understood my words either because I've told you that people are never the same as they were, but I will never say they can't change. You are the one who saw hopelessness in it, not me. I only said you spoke to someone in the past that doesn't exist anymore if that's the person you wanted. And maybe that is. Some version that didn't yet realize how much being with you hurt. 




You know yourself. You're confident and self-assured. You have and understand what most don't. You know people. You're good at knowing people. You've got a big brain. You're really smart. You're always trying to be better than you were before. You're misunderstood. 

Those are your words. They're why I always feel like you were looking down and it didn't matter what I thought or felt. Again, I need to retrofit that your intentions aren't the same as how your words and actions were perceived. Fixes everything. 

I know myself. I know my flaws. I know my toxic traits. I do not expect things in return for my love and care except to not be treated like a monster or disrespected. We were never compatible. ",1,1749491308.0,u_LittleBoyCutYourHair,0,1.0,False

1l7bc7x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7bc7x,Millie appreciation post,"Burner account but whatever 

I loved her since the beginning of the series , pilot specifically.
Even tho her character remained flat for the majority of season 1 (hence all the jokes of her being a tool for Moxxie’s development and being a supportive wife),I can’t really hate a character tbh because they’re obviously fictional and it’s the writer’s responsibility bla bla.
**ghostfuckers** I loved this episode for her ,even if it’s Blitz in the headline,and it was subtle,in my opinion it showed how she changed too.When Blitz first met her in the past,she was surprised to know someone would go out of their way to brawl for her trust and skills,and when they moved in the office for the first time,she doubted that imps are something more than low life hot tempered killing machines(mostly because she was born in the wrath ring yeah) but I saw how Blitz helped her see another part of herself,it was a balance of them both in this episode and I loved it.Even when she had a haircut after meeting the crew ,I thought of the “hair holds memories” thing and I really liked how it highlighted the fact that she wanted to change ,start somewhere fresh where she’s still herself,strong and skilled,but also worthy of gaining respect kindness without having to fight her all to get it,showing how she stepped out of her comfort zone with little fear.I also liked the scene where he hold Blitz’s hand and comforted him,having a look at her perspective on his character,she’s loving towards people that care(I think she’s the least traumatized HB character out of them all lol) which helps a lot because she knows how to handle situations when it comes to someone feeling blue and her communication skills come into actions,but I don’t see her just as all *that*.
**unhappy campers** it felt like writers began to get pissed and annoyed at the amount of hate and picking on the show because of the lack of female representation development and created this whole episode just to spite them(I love Barbie Wire so it was a plus).Representation is subtle in all kinds of real life situations,so when it’s shoved in the face it’s kind of ..annoying,yeah.
**sinsmas** I immediately knew the pregnant trope the moment she wasn’t here self and puked(“after a night of passion she woke up with a feeling of sickness,she immediately ran to the bathroom and threw up in the toilet” wattpad scene moment).But I’m somewhat not surprised,they were all over each other in every episode, I saw many complaints about how it’s “lazy writing”,and something in me feels that it’s a *nice with a grain of salt* choice of character arc where we could see how M&M’s relationship changes if they have the baby and how they actually cooperate regarding a real life situation,even if it’s not a day-to-day scenario,I really wanna see how it’s gonna affect her,her body changing,hormone spikes,postpartum&depression(if that’s how imps in the hellaverse work),knowing that it’s a harsh and life changing process,I’m interested to see if she’s going to regret keeping the baby because it means no more killing people,no more activities she enjoys(only the aggressive parts,she’s very playful and can be childish),if M&M’s relationship will change drastically even if they’re so loving towards each other ,how she will deal with her body changing.


Anyways ,thank y’all if you’ve made it this far in this yapping session of mine,love my girl Mildred till i die and I really hope to see more of her past(including her relationship with Sallie May and why she trusts her the most)and perhaps interests,just like we know about Moxxie(his coffee choice,love for operas,guitar skills,fear of mascots and such) and Blitz(big FAN of horses)",15,1749491200.0,HelluvaBoss,1,1.0,False

I was getting coffee cuz i was tired so i wasn't even feeding into it, just trying to place my order n go. I get a lot of extras and oat milk in my coffee and asked about any deals. I got the worst valley girl type response when i started trying to ask if she got the- and she cuts me off like ""yeah i got it"" just to still ask what milk i asked for while making it. Her attitude was so bad the manager came out and started faking being busy. I asked if 2 cookies were extra (last time i had someone just offer so i didn't know that was an option or how much). Of course in her rude voice she goes yes you have to pay (as if i wouldn't) and the manager says its fine as im asking how much. As im paying the girl serving me makes sure to let me know its gonna ask if i want to leave a tip. And honestly i still was gonna leave $1 till she said that. I wanted to say ""i know thats why im hitting 0"" but i just hit it and left.

I wanted to vent over that cuz when i tell you i was making a point to only talk related to ordering and short as possible. Its always horrible service when they want to remind you to tip. Had something similar and the server stood over my bf while he had the card reader to pressure him into tipping. That pissed me off so much and he still hit 0.

I have a vision for a specific cocktail (I'm in the right subreddit, I promise) where I clarify an espresso martini to the point that it is clear, and then serve it with hazelnuts covered in dyed white chocolate (to look like olives). I've gotten some of the way there already: I'm able to create the cocktail itself and do the standard milk-curdling process to clarify the espresso martini with the help of some citric acid, but, unfortunately, the drink is still very brown.

My hypothesis, and this is lightly confirmed by a bar in Japan where they made something called ""coffee acid"", is that I should be able to vacuum distill (or regular distill, I guess) this concoction and it'll become clear. Unfortunately, Kazu and the Cheese Wizard of the incomparable Bar Libre in Tokyo aren't exactly in my time-zone anymore, so I'm being left to my own devices and my trusty Reddit account.

While I have *some* experience distilling, I have some initial concerns, as follows:

- If I distill the entire drink (commercial coffee liquor, espresso, commercial vodka) will I need to worry about heads and tails and the like, or will the whole volume of distillate be drinkable
- Can/should I instead attempt to replicate the ""coffee acid"" trick: distilling espresso mixed with citric acid into a clear distillate that tasted like citrus but smelled like coffee? Conceivably I could skip the coffee liquor and add vodka and creme de cacao and make a pretty convincing drink which is clear.

the thing is that i was really thinking about her on this first week away and decided to reached yesterday with a pic of a coffee shop from her hometown, asking how she was

she commented on the pic and sent me a pic of her on the beach, saying she's been enjoying the sun a lot. then, after a few minutes, she sent me a one time view pic of her with friends coming home after a party and asked, with curiosity, how my week has been

so far, so good

but i got myself feeling stupid for reaching out when, rationally, i know i shouldn't be investing into this. moreover, i feel icky toward myself for initiating communication so soon and now i just want to disappear, honestly

bc of this emotional reaction, i'm gonna back alllll the way now and keep focusing on meeting ladies where i'm at

The USA. Land of the free. Playground for the ambitious. Digital nomads salivate at the thought of sipping cold brew in a Brooklyn loft or coding from a sun-blasted rooftop in LA. The country’s magnetic pull? Opportunity, diversity, and a cultural cocktail that never stops fizzing.

But the American dream for digital nomads? It’s a riddle, wrapped in red tape, sprinkled with possibility.

*🧭* _Curious about your digital nomad income potential? [Diagnose it in under 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_

## Why the USA is a Magnet for Digital Nomads

From Silicon Valley’s tech vortex to Miami’s crypto fever, the U.S. is a siren song for remote workers. Fast Wi-Fi, global connections, and the promise of “making it” lure nomads from every continent.

Yet, beneath the neon lights, there’s a catch. The rules of the game are murky. The stakes? High.

## Defining the Digital Nomad

Forget the cliché of the backpacker with a laptop. Digital nomads are borderless professionals—remote workers, freelancers, entrepreneurs—who chase Wi-Fi instead of roots. Their currency: flexibility. Their passport: ambition.

They’re not just escaping the 9-to-5. They’re rewriting the script.

*🌍* _Want to know if your skills can fund your freedom? [Check your digital nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_

## Remote Work, Global Movement, and Freedom

Freedom is intoxicating. But in the USA, it’s also complicated. The government’s gaze is sharp. The rules, labyrinthine. The digital nomad’s quest? Stay legal, stay mobile, stay paid.

## The American Dream: Still Alive for Nomads?

The myth: Show up, plug in, and thrive. The reality: Immigration law is a minefield. The American dream is alive—but only for those who play by the rules, or know how to bend them without breaking.

## Myth vs. Reality

You can’t just waltz in, laptop blazing, and declare yourself open for business. The system wasn’t built for digital nomads. It’s built for employees, tourists, and investors. Nomads? Square pegs, round holes.

*🚀* _Ready for the truth about your earning power? [Uncover your digital nomad income potential!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_

## U.S. Immigration Law: The Elephant in the Room

Immigration law is a fortress. Work visas are the keys, but the locks are rusty and the guards suspicious. The U.S. doesn’t have a “digital nomad visa.” You’re either here to work for a U.S. employer, invest, study, or visit.

Everything else? Legal gray zone.

## Work Visas and Legal Landmines

H-1B, L-1, O-1—an alphabet soup of restrictions. These visas demand sponsorship, paperwork, and patience. Freelancers and remote workers for foreign companies? Not on the menu.

## Tourist Visas: The Mirage of Legality

The B-2 tourist visa and ESTA waiver look tempting. Six months of American adventure, right? Wrong. These visas are for leisure, not labor. Work—even for a non-U.S. company—can land you in hot water.

*💡* _Think you can make it as a digital nomad? [Find out your income potential in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_

## What You Can and Can’t Do

Tourist visa holders can attend conferences, network, and explore. But earning money—even remotely—while physically in the U.S. is a legal gray area. The letter of the law says no. The spirit? Open to interpretation.

## ESTA and Visa Waiver Program: A Loophole?

ESTA is the fast track for citizens of select countries. Ninety days, no fuss. But don’t get cocky. The rules are clear: tourism and business meetings only. Remote work? The government’s watching.

## The Fine Print

Think you’re invisible behind your laptop? Think again. U.S. Customs can—and will—ask questions. One wrong answer, and your American dream ends at the border.

## The B-1/B-2 Visa: Business or Pleasure?

The B-1 visa is for business. The B-2 is for pleasure. But the line between the two? Razor-thin. You can attend meetings, negotiate contracts, or scout investments. But actual work—especially for a U.S. entity—is off-limits.

## The Blurred Lines

What about remote work for a foreign company? The law is silent. Some say it’s fine. Others say it’s risky. The truth? It depends on who you ask—and who’s asking.

## The Elusive Digital Nomad Visa: Does It Exist in the USA?

Europe’s got them. Latin America’s rolling them out. The U.S.? Not yet. The digital nomad visa is a unicorn—rumored, desired, but nowhere to be found.

## Wishful Thinking or Imminent Reality?

Advocacy groups are pushing. Lawmakers are listening. But for now, digital nomads must navigate the old system with new tricks.

*🌍* _Curious if your skills can support your nomadic lifestyle? [Diagnose your income potential here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_

## Remote Work for Foreign Companies: The Gray Zone

If you’re paid by a non-U.S. company, is it legal to work remotely from the U.S.? The law is ambiguous. Some say yes, as long as you’re not taking a U.S. job. Others say no—work is work, regardless of who pays.

## Who’s Paying You Matters

U.S. authorities care about where the money comes from—and where the work happens. If you’re earning in the U.S., even remotely, you could be seen as working illegally.

## U.S. Taxes: Uncle Sam Wants His Cut

Stay too long, and you’re a tax resident. The IRS doesn’t care where your clients are. If you meet the “substantial presence” test, you owe taxes. Surprise!

## Residency Traps and Tax Surprises

Cross the 183-day threshold, and your global income is fair game. Ignore this at your peril. The IRS is relentless.

## State Laws: Fifty Shades of Bureaucracy

Each state is a mini-country. Some welcome nomads. Others want a piece of your pie. Local taxes, business licenses, and regulations can trip you up.

## Why Your Location Inside the U.S. Matters

California loves paperwork. Texas loves business. New York loves taxes. Where you land determines your headaches.

## Tech Infrastructure: Silicon Dreams and Wi-Fi Nightmares

America is the land of Google and Facebook, but don’t expect flawless Wi-Fi everywhere. Urban centers are digital paradises. Rural areas? Not so much.

## The Digital Nomad’s Toolkit

Coworking spaces, coffee shops, and public libraries are your lifelines. Invest in a hotspot. Prepare for dead zones.

## Cost of Living: Sticker Shock or Value?

The U.S. is a land of extremes. Manhattan rents will make your eyes water. Boise, Idaho? Surprisingly affordable. Vanlife is the wildcard—cheap, but not always easy.

## Cities, Suburbs, and Vanlife

Choose your battleground. Cities offer connections and chaos. Suburbs offer space and silence. The open road offers freedom—and a unique set of challenges.

## Healthcare: The Achilles’ Heel of the American Adventure

Healthcare in the U.S. is a paradox. World-class care, sky-high prices. Get insurance or risk financial ruin. Emergencies don’t care about your visa status.

## Insurance and Emergencies

International health insurance is non-negotiable. Read the fine print. Know where the nearest hospital is. Hope you never need it.

America is a paradox—individualistic, yet teeming with communities. Digital nomad meetups, coworking spaces, and online forums are your lifelines.

## Coworking, Meetups, and Digital Nomad Hotspots

Major cities have thriving nomad scenes. Find your tribe. Share war stories. Collaborate. Survive.

## Safety and Security: Navigating the Unknown

The U.S. is safe—mostly. But crime, scams, and natural disasters lurk. Stay alert. Trust your instincts. Blend in.

## Urban Legends and Real Risks

Ignore the headlines. Most danger is avoidable. But don’t be naive. Stay connected. Have a plan.

## The Gig Economy: Friend or Foe?

The U.S. gig economy is a double-edged sword. Uber, DoorDash, Upwork—opportunity and exploitation, hand in hand. But most platforms require work authorization.

## Platforms, Permits, and Pitfalls

No work permit, no gig. Don’t risk it. Focus on remote work for foreign clients—or get creative.

## The Future: Will the U.S. Embrace Digital Nomads?

Change is coming. Slowly. The digital nomad revolution is forcing policymakers to rethink old rules. The U.S. may join the party—eventually.

## Policy Shifts and Grassroots Movements

Advocacy is growing. Cities want your dollars. States want your innovation. The future? Unwritten.

## Workarounds: Creative (and Legal) Alternatives

Incorporate abroad. Partner with U.S. companies. Explore student or investor visas. The system is rigid, but not unbreakable.

## Incorporation, Partnerships, and Beyond

Set up a business in Estonia. Partner with a U.S. entity. Apply for an O-1 visa if you’re extraordinary. There’s always a backdoor—if you’re bold enough to find it.

## Final Reckoning: Is the USA Worth the Hassle?

The U.S. is a paradox—land of opportunity, fortress of bureaucracy. For digital nomads, it’s a high-stakes game. The payoff? Immense. The risks? Real.

Choose wisely. The American dream is alive—but only for those who dare to play by their own rules.",1,1749490111.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

We have been together over one and a half years the beginning was amazing we had alining views on our path in life mostly. I come from an single mom who had a good job and education she comes from a family with two parents who dropped out of highschool. So she grew up lowers class and our upbringings where not insanely different but still noticeable enough. This has caused some minor bickering in the aspect of her not knowing how to dress or act in a respectful manner at family gatherings of mine but she always tries her best to stay poised and polite this has never been an issue other than her not talking at all at the gatherings and due to her anxiety i end up spending the entire time tending to her needs going outside or leaving early and not getting to enjoy myself. Now i had anxiety as a kid and did therapy and am in a good place now so i dont judge her for it but she never wants to try anything new. She is just so scared of everything and overthinks too the point where i have to cater my life around her at first it didn’t bother me. But now its getting to a point where im getting tired, i recently got back in contact with an old friend f18 and my gf insecurities are stopping me from see a friend i went to meet up with my friend a few weeks ago we got coffee and sat at a picnic table in a park and caught up i stayed a respectful distance from her and never made physical contact to respect both of our relationships and me and her never had any sexual or romantic relationship of any sorts neither now or in the past. But when i got home after 1-2hrs of chatting i come home to a angry and crying girlfriend we talk it out and she says she was overthinking the entire time. I have never done anything to not have her trust me.
I tried to schedule a meet up with my friend again because since the relationship i have had no friends at all and would like to have a social life outside of my relationship. When i told my girlfriend she said i was only allowed if she came over so that she could quote supervise us. I dont care about that because there is absolutely nothing to hide but its the controlling and trust aspect of it. We work together live together go too school together we are always together at first it was okay but i cant even get off the couch to go pee with out being asked what i am doing where im going she asks why i close the door if i try to close the door to poop. I can do nothing alone. I stopped doing all the hobbies i did before her. All we do it rot on the couch watching tv i gained 80lbs with her and i have no more motivation to do anything because of her. But i feel stuck she lives with me and we have a puppy together. She also has terrible spending habits so i spend half my pay on her. I have no more savings. 

I say all this negative stuff but i still love her or well i did love her now i just don’t feel a connection with her not the same as i used to i wanted her to be the mother of my kids i wanted to grow old with her but now i don’t know. Did i fall out of love is it just frustration and overthinking should i tough it out. I genuinely was in love with this girl but now i don’t know. I’m scared to leave and realize it was a mistake and not have her there when i realize that she was the one. We have intimacy but it doesn’t feel the same as it did before it just feels like a chore sometimes.

But she is this amazing person she cares deeply for me and i do for her i would never want to hurt her so im stuck in this though process and have no one to talk too about it. So im asking a bunch of strangers online for advice. Cos i don’t know where to ask",0,1749490080.0,whatdoIdo,1,0.5,False
1l7au8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l7au8g/aita_for_being_confused_when_someone_told_me_im/,AITA for being confused when someone told me I’m not at their “level of queerness”?,"Preface: I already cut ties with this person. Hung up on the fact I don’t know what level of queerness even means. I just recently came out as bisexual I like girls too. I communicated this multiple times. For context this was all after an hour date over coffee. 


I (22F) recently came out as gay after growing up in a strict religious household and attending religious schools. Accepting myself took years of inner turmoil, and I still face family backlash for living openly. I’m navigating my queer identity and trying to live authentically despite these challenges.

I met a woman (23F) who approached me first. We texted for two weeks and met in person once. She then sent a message saying we weren’t compatible because I’m not at her “level of queerness” and our political values didn’t align (we barely discussed politics). She emphasized needing a partner who’s politically active and engaged in queer community spaces.

I replied that her judgment hurt, especially since I’m still exploring queerness after a restrictive upbringing. I’ve never been to Pride—not by choice, but because my background limited such opportunities. My friends are still adjusting to my identity, but I’m showing up as myself. I understand compatibility matters, but it stings to be told my experiences as a queer person aren’t enough because I haven’t yet engaged in specific ways she expects.

She clarified it’s not about being “out” but how I engage with queerness daily—like having queer friends, being in community, and being politically active. She didn’t want to “pull” that from me or wait for it to develop.

I get wanting a partner with shared values, but it feels dismissive to be judged as not “queer enough” when my background restricted my exposure to queer spaces. AITA for feeling confused and hurt?

**Text messages:**

**Her (Gray Text):** “I feel like we might be in different places in life, as well as hold different values. … I think when I’m looking for a potential partner, it’s super important to me that we have similar values, especially politically. And I think I’ve spent a lot of time with my queerness and I’d want a partner who is ready to meet me at the same level.”

**Me (Blue Text):** “I’m hurt that you think just because I accepted recently who I am doesn’t mean I’m not ready to be out. … To me there are no levels of queerness. I’m gay that’s just what it is. … This feels like you genuinely look down on me as a person based off of one interaction. … You made a judgment based off one interaction. It genuinely hurts me.”

**Her (Gray Text):** “I’m not questioning you and your queerness. It’s less about being out and accepted, but more of ways that you engage with queerness in your life, not just your romantic relationships. Being in community and having queer friends, being politically active and caring about QT issues. … I don’t want to have to wait or pull information out of you if that’s not something you think to talk about in the first place.”

**Me (Blue Text):** “As for my political values I wasn’t able to fully explain it. As I grew up a certain way doesn’t mean I view opinions the way my family does. I like to have open conversations concerning politics to learn more. I’m not close minded.”",12,1749490069.0,AITAH,44,0.93,False

From relatives and cousins not wishing or meeting me n my family to friends not wishing me even on messages and some ignoring my Eid greetings. And a very close person ignoring me totally on Eid and ignoring my requests of at least not to behave like this on Eid, that I am already goin thru a lot…

Why do people change????
Is there smthng wrong with me? Am I cursed? That every person I talk to is initially so invested and nice and then the second conversation feels like I’m bothering them? 

Am I wrong to think my friends and loved ones will be there for me when I need them? specially when I’m goin thru tough time or on occasions?

Today I stood in window looked outside and cried bcoz I wanted to go out with a friend have a coffee or something or a drive maybe,,, to have someone to talk to… never knew lonliness wud be this painful.

If anyone says I shud talk to strangers, even did that, but even a stranger behaved the same way.. one day v nice and helpful n second day scolding me and being rude with me..

I feel my self respect has broken into pieces..
Every person I trusted has proved I was a fool to trust them.

That one person who I was closest to, says talking to me tires him, I don’t bring him any joy. And my requests and cries all were left unheard.. today I tried for one last time… but it was so painful to hear the same person using so harsh tone ; I gave up…

I am so tired of harshness, rudeness and bad behavior of people around me, even my own mom always brings me down saying I’m a failure and not good enough! 

I am a self made person and worked hard my whole life. But now at this stage I feel every one is convincing me that my existence is useless and I should not even exist. My WhatsApp literally has zero messages everyday…. Even my messages are left on read… 

I don’t know what else to do.. how much a person can try with people so they don’t change… I told someone that even if u keep a cat , u get attached to it and even the cat; his answer was * ok but what if the cat isn’t attached to you, would u force it to be attached to u?** and it broke me even further…

The obstacle course reportedly contains one Rivian van for training purposes, with Amazon aiming to have humanoid robots “hitch a ride in the back of Amazon’s electric Rivian vans and spring out to deliver packages.”

The report coincides with Amazon launching a new agentic AI team to help develop technologies that will power robots “operating in Amazon distribution and logistics hubs.” In [a statement to ](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2025/06/04/amazon-tech-ai-sunnyvale-south-bay-economy-jobs-deliver-commerce-work)[*Silicon Valley*](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2025/06/04/amazon-tech-ai-sunnyvale-south-bay-economy-jobs-deliver-commerce-work), Amazon says that “instead of rigid, specialized robots, we’re creating systems that can hear, understand, and act on natural language commands, turning warehouse robots into flexible, multi-talented assistants.”

Amazon has a long history of using robots in its warehouses, and even acquired robotics company Kiva Systems back in the day. Amazon acquired Massachusetts-based Kiva Systems in 2012. Since then, Amazon has developed, produced, and deployed more than 750,000 robots across its operations network. So they have built up some expertise in this area.

I worked a lot to get into it, I spent a lot of time and energy to apply and to submit an abstract and create a presentation for the conference.

Yesterday I finally arrived here and today was the first day of the conference. I skipped breakfast because I woke up late and then went to the uni building to attend the panels. One hour later, there was a coffee break and I went to take my antidepressant pills and surprise! I forgot to bring them with me from the hostel. Everything just went downhill from there... My presentation sucked, I did not talk to any other participants because I felt tired and scared and I ate lunch by myself on a bench, trying to hold back tears bc I could not stop my bad thoughts from pouring in. Finally, I left early and went back to the hostel I am staying at to sulk in my bed and listen to sad music.

I feel like this may be just a very privileged problem, but it still sucks. I hate those pills and I hate even more that I was dumb and forgot to bring them with me. I could go to the end of the world, to the happiest and most beautiful city, and still feel like absolute shit because of my brain.

My MRIs and ultrasounds showed signs of mild inflammation and synovial thickening (as well as mild scoliosis) but it was mild enough to be only subjectively interpreted, which I understood and accepted. I was put on Yuflyma (Humira/Adalimumab) and was told my diagnosis would be more concrete if I showed a positive response to the injection, which I definitely have. However, there are a wide range of pain-related symptoms that have not been improved by the injection - shoulder blade pain (a general feeling of them being “misaligned”) can be severe and frequent, rib pain (I get the feeling that one sticks out too much on my right side and is painful to the touch sometimes, but I could be imagining it), deep aching muscle pains, a feeling of instability in my knees, painful feet when walking only for a short time and crackling shoulders are a few ongoing symptoms. 

My rheumatologist wrote these off as possibly explained by fibromyalgia, which I was thought to have before results started showing on my scans, and I accepted this at the time as I didn’t know what to say. But I wrote back recently as these ongoing symptoms are really bothering me and he suggested, on a phone call, that I could have HSD. A physiotherapist from the same hospital noted I’m hypermobile, though not in many of the joints tested on the Beighton score. But my rheumatologist said that a lot of women with fibromyalgia suffer with symptoms shared by HSD, and there’s no way to tell which of the two diagnoses I have. The resolution was for me to try out some exercises for the problematic joints that he’d send me in the post. 

Is there really no way to ever figure out which of the two conditions I have at all, if I even have either of them?

I also have a few symptoms that don’t seem to be explained by the arthritis diagnosis or HSD, most of these being symptoms he’s never really addressed - tachycardia, migraines, digestive issues (predominantly a feeling of food getting stuck, bloating, nausea, and getting full too quickly), painfully red and itchy hands if I’m too warm, going through periods of needing to pee constantly even if I’ve just gone (which can be triggered by drinking certain things like coffee, tea, fizzy drinks, etc) and getting hot too quickly and easily go the point of very obvious facial flushing are the ones I can think of right now.

1l7am99,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l7am99/doors_to_elsewhere_a_travellers_guide_warning/,"Doors To Elsewhere: A Travellers Guide, Warning: Never Enter The Crimson Door.","Hello everyone! It's been a while since I've been here. I don't mean here on Reddit, but rather on this side of the Earth Door. I'm sure to most of you that statement doesn't make sense, so allow me to introduce myself and explain. My name is Marik. I am what you would call a Door-to-Door traveler. I have the ability to see special Doors, which lead to other dimensions. 

There are others like me, but we're pretty rare. I've traveled to many places throughout the years, and I've never really spoken with anyone about them besides my mother. Since this seems like a community to share strange and spooky stories, I figured this would be the perfect time and place to share one, but to do that, I need to start from the beginning.

It started when I was in the 9th grade. One day, as I was walking to class with some friends, I noticed a strange Door on the wall. I had never noticed it before, and it looked abnormal. Instead of having 90-degree angles, it looked like it had been put through a fun house mirror, with obtuse and acute edges all around its frame. I walked over to it and put my hand against it. Immediately, it swung open, and I was bathed in the color of wonder. In front of me was a giant space going up and down forever. Far below was another strangely shaped Door. In shock, I gasped and fell backwards. My friends came over and asked me what was wrong. I pointed at the Door, and asked them where it had come from. They looked at me strangely and asked

“What Door?” 

I gestured towards it, but now it was gone, replaced by an empty wall. I gave a small chuckle, mumbling about being tired, and went on with my day. I figured it was just a one-off instance, but I was wrong. As the days went on, I began seeing random Doors in places they shouldn't be, like flat on sidewalks, high up on unreachable walls, or even along the corners of rooms. They were always so bright and would sometimes hurt my eyes, and each time, I was the only one who could see them. I began to think I was going crazy, thinking it was some genetic mental disorder that was starting to manifest. I was afraid to tell my mom, so I did my best to ignore it, but eventually, there were so many that I could barely focus on school. So one morning in tears, I ran up to my mother and told her I thought my eyes were messed up or that there was something wrong with my head, because I was seeing strange, bright Doors everywhere. I expected her to be concerned or alarmed, but instead, she closed her eyes and took a sip from her coffee.

“You aren't going crazy, dear, don't worry.”

In obvious confusion, I asked her what she meant. She put down her cup and smiled at me.

“Because I see them too.”

Door-sight is what she called it. She didn't give it that name; the government did. In the 80s, they ran an operation called “Beyond The Veil”. They discovered the Doors' existence and that only some people could see and open them. So they went around and gathered up a bunch of “Door-seers”. Then they began running experiments to see why some people could see them and why some couldn't, and to explore what lay beyond them. My mother knew all this because she was one of the people rounded up. Eventually, the operation was canceled when they found some other method to find and open them, something my mother said they called an “Orius”, and so they gave her money and swore her to secrecy. 

There were theories that the sight could be passed down, and now this was confirmation. My mother said that the sight would eventually stabilize and I would be able to control which Doors I wanted to see, but also warned not to explore any of them until I was older. She traveled a lot when she was younger, and learned that some Doors were best left closed, at least until you were ready to see what was on the other side. Of course, with me being young and believing I was invincible, I didn't listen. I would sometimes open smaller doors and give a little peek. Most of them just led to random places in our world, while some rare ones led to places that couldn't exist here.

With all that exposition out of the way, I'll now tell you about my first and worst big trip. This happened long ago, and since then, I have heeded my mother's words much more strictly, and if you are a new “Door-seer,” then heed my words too. Never, under any circumstances, should you ever enter “The Crimson Door.”

A year after I gained the sight, I had learned how to control it enough that I could filter how many Doors I saw at a given time. I also learned they followed certain rules. Every Door had a time limit on how long it would stay in one place. Some would be around for days, while others a few seconds. Doors also always lie flat against a surface, regardless of whether it is rounded, sharp, or flat. I say all this to display how odd The Crimson Door was. One night, it appeared in the middle of our backyard, floating in the air instead of being attached to something. Its deep, bright crimson glow penetrated my upstairs window. It was foreboding, almost like it was trying to lure me in. The Door remained there for weeks, which was the longest one had ever stayed in place. Another rule the Doors always followed was that they cycled through some random palette of 3 colors, like orange, green, and blue, or purple, white, and yellow. This Door remained that haunting crimson. 

The final strange thing about it was that my mother couldn't see it. She warned me not to enter it, saying anomalies like that were bound to lead to somewhere horrific, but I'm sure you can guess what happened. Late one night, I tossed some snacks and water into a bag, put on my raincoat, and snuck out of the house. The Door was larger than most, easily about 7 to 8 feet tall. There was some kind of repetitive noise coming from it, and it felt like it was looking at me. I figured I'd only be gone for a little bit, and only grabbed the bag to make myself feel like a true adventurer. I figured once I was done exploring a bit, I'd get back to bed before Mom noticed a thing. I took a deep breath and pushed it open. My body was immediately ripped inside, and I blacked out from the force.

My vision blurred as I woke up. My neck hurt from the whiplash, and my head pounded from hitting it against the ground. When my vision finally cleared, I realized I was in the middle of a dark hallway with closed normal doors lining it. The hallway curved slightly in the distance, preventing me from seeing the end. Each door had a pulsing crimson glow coming from under it. The hallway was silent, and there was an eerie chill in the air. I picked myself up and tightened my coat around myself. I turned around to find the Door, but all I found was more hallway. The Door was nowhere in sight. I thought about calling out, but I figured it would be smarter to explore in silence, so I turned back around and began walking. As I walked along, sometimes that repetitive noise would come from one of the doors, and a shadow would appear underneath it. Instinctively, I would try to move away from it and stay still. Eventually, the noise and shadow would go away. I repeated this pattern until, finally, I saw a bright red light beyond the curve of the hallway. When I reached it, I found myself in some kind of basement.

The basement looked somewhat unfinished, and had two doorless hallways to the left and right of me, and a staircase in front of me. The left one led into another long hallway that had no end in sight, while the right one led to some sort of pit, with a giant dark hallway behind it. In that darkness, I swore I saw something moving. I craned my neck and saw something staring back at me, which caused me to jump and immediately run up the stairs. 

I then found myself in an unfinished lobby. To my right was what looked like a check-in desk, but it wasn't fully painted. Past that was another staircase that went to a higher floor. In front of me were giant windows and a large glass door that opened out into a forest. Though the trees obscured the sky, the crimson glow seemed to be beaming down from it. I walked to the center of the room and looked down. On the floor was a strange collage of unrecognizable symbols and odd paintings, depicting tall red figures with hollow eyes. There seemed to be people bowing to them, and a smaller figure holding up their hand with a strange symbol on it. 

“What the fuck is this?” I thought as I continued to study it. Suddenly, that repetitive sound started again. It was coming from all around me, and the crimson glow began to get brighter. Then the noise shifted from all around me to directly above me. I slowly looked up to the source.

Eyes. Countless crimson eyes stared down at me. Long red humanoids with pinprick crimson eyes within hollow sockets, and long mouths with more crimson eyes moving around inside stared into me. They clung to red vein-like web-looking things in a tunnel that went upwards high into an abyss. The ceiling within the upward tunnel was impossible to see, and those things continued to emerge from the impossible heights, each one with long, haunting gaping maws and so many eyes within. One of them slowly began reaching its long limb towards me. It had warped fingers that shifted like an illusion; sometimes there were three fingers, other times there were ten. My eyes began to roll, and that repetitive sound got louder. The creature grabbed my face and began feeling around. I couldn't move. The creature began to fill my mind with visions of a large group of people surrounded by these things, with each one having crimson eyes and leaking a glowing, iridescent red liquid from their bodies. In the center of them all was a girl with bright red hair, brownish crimson streaked eyes, and a symbol on her hand. It looked just like the paintings. 

The creature lifted me off the ground, bringing me closer to its face as it began to open its mouth wide and began to pry mine open. A bunch of eyes moved around within its mouth, and a smaller creature began to crawl out and latched onto its arm. It then began slowly crawling towards my open mouth. Another vision flashed before me, this time of my mother entering the Crimson Door, distraught and calling for me. She climbs the stairs and sees me, standing in the middle of this room, with deep crimson eyes and a disgusting smile.

That vision snapped me from freeze to fight or flight. Right as the thing reached my mouth, I punched the bigger one's arm, causing it to let go, and I fell to the ground. The little creature fell too, making a loud squelching thud. The big one let out a noise that I can only describe as something we aren't meant to hear. With flight in full effect and nowhere to go but forward, I whipped my body around and began running towards the lobby door. With all my might, I burst through the glass and ran blindly into the forest ahead.

I tripped multiple times as I ran through the forest. The light of the crimson sky illuminated my path just enough that I didn't smash headfirst into any of the dark trees. I didn't stop until the adrenaline began to wear off and a sharp pain shot through my leg, causing me to fall over. I shifted into a sitting position and checked my leg. There was a glass shard just below my knee, and blood leaked from the wound. I had a few other cuts on my hands and other leg, but none of them were as deep and bloody as this one. Now the pain was beginning to peak, and I bit my lip hard to prevent myself from screaming. I reached into my backpack and pulled out an apple. I shoved it into my mouth, bit down hard, and painfully pulled the shard out. I used my water to try to clean the cut, and then took my coat off and wrapped it around the gash the best I could. I drank the remaining water and sprinkled a little on my other cuts. My mother was right. I shouldn’t have come here. I looked back toward the way I came. 

“Maybe the Door was in the other direction of that hallway.” I thought. “Ain't no way in hell I'm going back there.”

I used a nearby log to push myself up. The pain in my leg was unbearable, so I found a trusty stick and used it as a crutch. I knew if those things followed me, I'd be a sitting duck, so I prayed to whatever God was listening to help me get through this and get home. After I finished, much slower now, I pushed my way through the rest of the forest. When I finally reached the treeline, I collapsed to the ground. I felt so tired, and the thought of sleep felt appealing. I rolled over to look up at the sky and felt my heart stop. I quickly crawled back into the trees and lay still. 

“I shouldn’t have come here!” I thought as I looked up at the sky.

The source of the pulsing crimson was now revealed. A giant crimson orb hung high in the sky. It was like a giant meteor that blocked out the sun. Countless red figures moved around on its surface. From this distance, they looked small, but there was no mistaking the form of those accursed creatures. The orb hung over what looked like some kind of college campus. The words “B.R. University Main Hall” were engraved on one of the large buildings. For a moment, I considered just staying hidden in the trees. Maybe nightfall would come, and then I could move, assuming nightfall existed here. Pain shot through my leg again, and I looked down. While the coat seemed to be slowing down the bleeding, blood still leaked from underneath it. I now had a time limit. I cursed and looked back towards the campus. It seemed the treeline extended to some of the nearby buildings. 

“If I can just sneak along the trees, I should be able to take cover under some of the buildings.” I thought.

I knew eventually I'd have to go out in the open, but maybe by then I could find someone who could help me, or maybe get lucky enough to find the Door, whichever came first.

“Should have listened to Mom!” My conscience berated me.

After playing Mission Impossible and sidling along the trees and edges of buildings, I managed to reach what looked like the campus's center. There was a statue of a man with a little girl with long hair standing next to him. The pain in my leg had started to decrease, but dizziness had started to come and go. 

“I have to hurry.” I thought.

Then I heard someone talking, and I immediately hid behind a nearby bush. Coming up the path was a hooded person in strange, dark blue robes. They seemed to be talking to themselves. I remembered the image of those people from that painting, bowing to those red things. I did not want to talk to them, but I needed medical attention. 

“Maybe they're cool?” I thought. “Surely seeing a kid in danger will make them want to help me.”

16-year-old Marik was pretty naive. My mother always told me not to judge a book by its cover, so I figured even though this person was surely crazy, maybe they'd have some humanity within them.

“Hey!” I called out and stood up. The figure jumped and stopped muttering. “I'm sorry to scare you. I got injured.” I showed my leg wrapped in the coat. “Look, I just need some medical supplies or something, and then I'll be on my…”

The figure lifted a finger to where its mouth was and made a shush motion with it. They then lowered their hood. Underneath was a woman with grey hair tied up into a strange bun. She wore strange glasses that hid her eyes. She looked like an older woman, thought it would be impolite to guess her age. She lowered her finger and then called out,

“Oooooh Illesia!”

The sound of rhythmic skipping came from somewhere to my left. I turned and saw another smaller hooded figure approaching us.  

“Yes, mother?!” The figure responded in a higher-pitched voice that sounded like a young girl.

“You missed one, dear. You told me you indoctrinated everyone on campus.” The little figure looked in my direction.

“But I did. This one's new. I don't recognize him.”

The older woman glanced back at me. 

“Where did you come from?” I blinked and stared at both of them.

“Look, I'm just trying to go home or stop myself from bleeding out. Can you please help me?”

“Where is home? How did you get here?” The woman responded stoically.

I sighed with frustration and pointed toward the forest, 

“I came from that way.”

“The dorms? Interesting. And how did you get there?” The woman asked.

“Look, lady…” I said, and suddenly my head swam. I leaned on my stick to regain balance. I was running out of time. “Please… I don't want to die…”

“If you answer my question, I may be able to help you.” She said. I sighed again. 

“Look, it won't make sense, but I came through a Door, OK?”

“The Crimson Door? So it appeared somewhere new.” She mused. I stared dumbly,

“Yeah sure, can you help me now? Do you know where the Door is? Or a hospital?”

The lady pointed at the big building with “B.R. Main Hall” written on it. 

“The Crimson Door usually appears somewhere in there, and as for a hospital, we have one close by that we can take you to. There's just one thing we have to do first.” I felt relieved. 

“OK, yeah, what's that?” She gestured to the smaller figure. 

“Illesia needs to indoctrinate you.” 

The smaller figure pulled down their hood, revealing a girl who looked a little younger than me, maybe 12 or 13 (compared to me being 16). She had fiery red hair and ominous light brown eyes, with a streak of crimson in both irises. She wore a strange smile that caused fear to shoot through me. She looked like the girl from the vision. I looked back at the woman. 

“That's okay. I think I'll just go find the Door on my own.” The lady shook her head.

“You misunderstand. It was not an offer. Regardless of how you got here, you are now a part of us. I can see the Crimson touched you, which means you need to be indoctrinated. Don't worry, if you come willingly, Illesia won't hurt you too badly.”

“What the hell!?” I said and began to try to stumble past her, but my head swam again, and I tripped. The lady caught me.

“Mom, can we make it fun? Give him a chance to run. I want more practice. Let's give him a head start.”

The lady stared at me and smiled. She stood me up and put my makeshift crutch back under my arm. 

“OK, I think that's fair. How much of a head start? Ten, fifteen seconds?”

“Five minutes,” I mumbled.

“Too long,” Illesia said. “How about twenty seconds? I think that's fair.”

“Twenty it is.” The woman said and let me go. “Best get moving.”

“ONE!”

I began hobbling towards the building. 

“Good idea, Marik. Next time judge THE CRAZY NUTCASES IN STUPID ROBES!” I yelled.

“TWO!”

Trying to move faster caused more pain.

“THREE!”

“FOUR!”

“FIVE!”

“SIX!”

Halfway to the building. I kept pushing, forcing my body forward the best I could.

“SEVEN!”

“EIGHT!”

“NINE!”

“TEN!”

I began to trip and fall as I reached the building's entrance. I rightened myself and tried to open it. 

“Locked!” I cursed.

“ELEVEN!”

“TWELVE!”

“THIRTEEN!” 

“FOURTEEN!”

I bashed the wood against the glass door, using all the strength I had. Out of anger, I then grabbed a rock and began smacking it against the glass.

“FIFTEENTH!”

“SIXTEEN!”

The glass began to crack, and I gave one final heave, putting all my power into it.

“SEVENTEEN!”

The glass shattered. I used the wood to knock away any major shards to prevent further cuts.

“EIGHTEEN!”

I pushed myself inside. My leg was about to give out again, and my vision was starting to dim.

“NINETEEN…”

The lady hadn't said what floor the Door was on. I knew I'd have to begin my search on this floor. I began getting as far away as I could from the entrance.

“TWENTY!” I heard as I rounded the corner.

The hallway was just like the basement one, dark and crimson. It was split into three parts. The part I had just come from, the one I was in, and one that turned to the left at the end. I hobbled and searched each door. All of them looked normal. I knew I'd recognise the Door when I saw it.

As I reached the end of the hallway and began to turn left, I heard the crunch of glass come from the front entrance. At the end of this hall was a staircase, and so I scrambled to it and went up as silently as I could. I began to hear the gleeful chuckles of the deranged child echoing through the halls. I decided I'd try to check the higher floors first and then work my way down, hopefully avoiding my stalker as she checked one by one. I made it to the sixth floor and began walking down the halls. Everything looked the same here. My head was spinning, and my vision was going in and out of focus.

“Hurry…” I thought.

I made it to the end of the floor and slowly approached the opposite staircase. I didn't hear anything below, so I quietly walked to the fifth floor and began walking up the hallway.

CRACK!

Just around the corner ahead, I heard the splinter of glass.

“Where are you??” Illesia said in a sweet, singsong voice. 

I felt my heart jump, and I silently pushed open a nearby door. 

“Why did she check this floor?!” I thought.

“You know, Indoctrination isn't so bad. I did it when I was younger. That's why I'm so good at doing it to others! It'll only hurt for a little bit, and then you won't feel a thing.”

I held my breath as I heard her approach my door. 

“You didn't close this door all the way. Are you even trying?”

I moved to the right side of the door and pressed my back against the wall as it swung open towards me. Her fiery hair flashed in the small door window, and as she moved in, it looked like two red spotlights moved with her, like she had two red flashlights in her head. She then looked to the left.  

“Not over here…”

She walked in a little more and stared at the far wall. 

“Not over there…” She giggled and began to turn towards me. “That means you must be over here…” I shut my eyes tight and began to pray again.

Then a loud thud sounded from below us. Illesia stopped turning and looked into the hallway. 

“So the open door was a distraction…Clever…” She muttered and walked back into the hall, slowly walking towards the stairs.

I let out a breath and waited. Once her footsteps were gone, I silently walked back into the hallway. I knew this could be a trap, but I was semi-conscious, carried on by will. While it was hard to tell where the thud came from, I figured she'd check the fourth floor below, so I stumbled to the third. 

My vision began to close in on the sides as I walked the third-floor hall. My leg felt so cold, and I was beginning to shiver. 

“Left foot, right foot. Nothing down the first hall. Second…”

I lost my footing and fell. I was out of energy. The rest of my body was becoming cold, and I felt numb. I began to think of Mom. 

“Sorry, I didn't listen…”

In my fading sight, I saw something glint off the floor. I lifted my head slightly. The floor was reflecting a light, brighter than the rest, a bright, deep crimson color. I lifted my head and saw my salvation. The Crimson Door floated at the end of the hall. In a moment of renewed will, I began crawling towards it. I had done it. I was going to make it. A shadow then moved behind the Door, halting me just a foot away from it. I looked past the Door and felt my heart jump. One of those horrid crimson creatures hung onto the outside window, its mouth wide open in a horrific smile, and its deep crimson pinprick eyes within its hollow socket bore into me with glee. 

“Found you.”

I felt myself get ripped backwards, and I rolled onto my back. The blurry image of Illesia stood above me. Her eyes were the color of the giant orb outside. Her body looked a little different, almost longer, but only slightly. She still looked human, but wrong somehow. 

“Don't feel bad. You did pretty well for someone in your condition. You may have even gotten away if it wasn't for my friend over there. That noise diversion was a neat touch, though. For a moment, I really doubted you were in that room. You'll have to tell me how you did it once we're done! Don't worry, like I said, indoctrination won't hurt too badly, at least not for long.”

Her blurry hand began to glow, and a strange greenish symbol appeared. She pressed it against my chest, and that's when the pain began. A powerful jolt tightened my limbs, which paralyzed me, and my veins began to glow green. She then grabbed onto my temples, which sent shockwaves of pain throughout my skull, causing me to start yelling. All I could see was her dark crimson eyes, and those creatures, which had begun to appear around her, staring at me with their haunting gaze. I think they were hallucinations, but their forms were vivid. The repetitive noise started as they all opened their disgusting, long mouths, and the eyes inside them moved around in a frenzy. At the back of each of their throats was another set of eyes that didn't move. Those eyes looked human. The tiny creatures began to crawl out and come towards me. Something was beginning to enter me through my temples. It felt like an intrusive thought, only it didn't belong to me. The pain had also started to fade, but that only scared me more. It meant whatever this “indoctrination” was, was about to end. 

“Wh-what's going to hap-pen to me? Am I go-going t-t-to die?” I stuttered through the pain. She looked down at me with pity.

“No, you won't die.” Her face then changed to a dark smile. “You'll become just like me.”

I tried to fight her, but was too weak, both from her strength and my blood loss. Tears began to flow as I thought of my mother.

“Mom, I'm sorry I didn't listen…” I cried.  “I'm so sorry…”

The hallucinations were getting stronger because I saw a new form appear behind Illesia. The form looked human, and they were wielding…A bat? 

CRACK!

The creatures and thoughts disappeared, and the pain ceased as Illesia was knocked off me by the force of a wooden bat. The figure then reached down and began to pull me up.

“Come on.” A muffled, distant voice yelled at me. In my haze, I could just barely make it out.

“Mom…” I mumbled. 

I felt myself lift to my feet, and I was slung over her shoulder. She tossed the bat aside and put her hand on the door, and it swung open. The figure of Illesia picked itself up and emitted a high-pitched, angry scream. Her form stretched again, and her face began to morph. I was glad I couldn't make out the details. The Illesia thing crossed the distance in a matter of seconds, but it was too late for her. My mother turned towards it and grabbed the door, causing a handle to manifest. Without another word, Mom pulled it, and the door slammed shut as we tumbled backwards into the grass of our yard. 

That was when I blacked out. I woke up a week later in the hospital. Apparently, I was more injured than I thought. My leg required some major stitches, and they had been pumping me with antibiotics, because the gash and a few other glass cuts had become infected. I also had a minor concussion. Mom stayed by my bed the entire time. She didn't say anything about what happened until we got home.

“I told you not to go into that Door! I've been doing this for a long time, so I know what I'm talking about! You could have died!”

“I'm sorry…” was all I could say. “How did you find me? I thought you said you couldn't see the Door.”

She sighed. “Of course, I could see it. I thought saying that would unsettle you enough to leave it alone. I had a dream of finding you possessed by one of those creatures, and I immediately knew you had entered it. Thankfully, it exited out into that building. My “mother” senses told me you were in danger, so I kicked some stuff over to cause a distraction. I’m glad that ended up working.”

“Will they follow us?”

“No. I closed the door. You have to enter a Door once in order to close it, or someone else has to enter it. You going in was a blessing in disguise, because now the Door is gone and it won't reappear here again, but do not think of that as an excuse to do this again. You will tell me from now on if you're going to Door-hop, and I will either go with you, or if I forbid you to go through one, you don't. Understand!?”

“Yes, Mom.”

And that's it. That's how my first Door-to-Door travel went. Over the many years since then, I have mastered my abilities. I haven't seen the Crimson Door since, and I hope I never have to again. I still have a scar on my leg that acts as a reminder of that day. For the most part, I've been able to move on, but sometimes, despite the extensive therapy, I'll dream about that red-haired girl, staring at me with those deep crimson eyes, and she'd smile at me, sometimes saying, 

“Found you!”, while at other times saying,

 “I see you!”, all in that damn singsong voice and wave at me as I wake up. 

I'd dismiss it as trauma, but the strange thing is, I haven't seen her since that day, yet in my dreams, her age changes. She's never younger than when I first saw her, but sometimes she'd be a few years older, while other times she'd be far older than me. Obviously, it could just be my mind playing tricks, but then I'd wake up, and I'd feel a burning in my temples and lower jaw where that thing pulled, which remains until I’m fully awake. When it first started, I'd even find slick, glowing crimson liquid on my pillow.

The liquid stopped long ago, and those dreams are a rarity nowadays. I try not to think about it, since all of that was decades ago.

Anyways, thanks for listening to my tale. Maybe someday I'll come back to tell other tales, but for now, for those other Door-to-Door travelers, heed my Mother's and my warning. Do not enter any Doors that stay one color, or if possible, always enter with a partner. You may not be as lucky as I, getting saved at the last moment. And of course, avoid the Crimson Door at all costs. That girl is still out there, and I'm sure she'll be happier to see you than you would be to see her.",2,1749489560.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

We are in the early stages of launching our mobile cafe and we’d love some advice from experienced folks here. We’re trying to choose the right espresso machine and power supply (generator or other options), but there’s a lot to consider and we don’t want to mess this part up.

So far, we’re leaning toward a 2-group machine like the La Spaziale S5 EK 2, but we’re not sure if that’s the best choice for a trailer setup. We’d love to hear:
	•	What espresso machines do you recommend for mobile setups?
	•	How much power do you realistically need to run an espresso machine + grinder + fridge + a grill toaster? The toaster and espresso machine alone seems to be around 6000w.. 
	•	Any recommendations for quiet generators or alternative power setups that have worked well for you?
	•	Anything you wish you knew before choosing your espresso machine or power setup?

We’ll mostly be making espresso-based drinks + toasties, and want to operate in different locations. Any input would be hugely appreciated!

1l7aiad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1l7aiad/argued_today_with_two_people_about_pauls_writing/,Argued Today With Two People About Paul's Writing,"Heya guys. I just wanted to record this experience and see what other folks thought about it.

Today I'm hanging out in my usual Christian coffee shop, two girls come in and are talking about the bible, and I'm thinking nothing of it until they start to discuss what is 'heresy' or not when it comes to believing certain parts of the Bible with the Barista (who I am sort of friends with). 

I end up in this conversation, and just asked them ""Do you believe the words of Paul are the will of God?"" They say yes, and I ask if that also applies to where Paul says women should not speak in Church/it is disgraceful for women to speak in Church. We get into the context of the verse. It is literal. It only applies to women and it is known that the men discuss before/after sermon about the teachings of God. Because women were considered uneducated, Paul did not want them distracting from the conversation. But this clashes with what God says about his teachings being for all, and also that we should treat our neighbors as ourselves. We would not forbid our neighbor from speaking in Church, so why a woman?

Besides, this isn't the only place Paul singles out women. My point I was trying to make to them is that some of Paul's writings are blatantly afflicted by the time and place he was living in, and women not speaking in church clearly does not reflect the will of God, since today we have female pastors, female singers, and tons of women speaking in Church to the glory of God. One could argue Paul was referring to ""listen when being taught"" but he instructs only the women to wait until they get home. According to Paul, at no time should a woman be speaking in Church. He explains that as clearly as he can.

So we argue, they ask if I even have scripture, what my denomination is, anything to avoid the question.

Finally after going back and forth, one of them blurts ""Women should just not speak in Church, Paul is right."" So I just said ""Great, that's what you believe."" They give me a blank expression, think about it, and then go ""Fine you fucking win"" because of course they are going to be speaking in Church later. 

I hate that what I said came from a place of anger. I did this because I saw those women as the same personas that have bullied me all my childhood. They are the same kinds of people who made my friends abandon their faith because they can't imagine accepting a gay person into their Church. In the name of my bullied youth and every one of my friends who's been told to kill themselves by people like that, I felt absolutely convicted to do what I did. Maybe they'll think twice next time about spewing the human opinions (Paul) that are causing people to abandon God's word and contributing the fall of the American Church.",0,1749489311.0,Christianity,6,0.5,False
1l7ahgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CDawgVA/comments/1l7ahgi/i_have_an_idea_for_lovers_vs_the_world/,I have an idea for Lovers vs the World,"Based on the beginning of last night's stream saying to put ideas on reddit, I gave it some thought and came up with an idea. I think it's good enough to risk posting here, but I worry it will take more than 2 weeks to organize. Still, even if it's considered for the future I think it might have legs. Maybe I'm being totally delusional? 

I think we all love Cycleathon, Generational Welsh, RV Trip and Tip to Tip. Apparently, we want them touching grass and exploring as much as gaming. So my idea was ""Lovers vs the REAL World"" (and gaming gauntlet too don't worry): Do the whole PCH trip in the allotted time (IIRC that's the name for the 101 that runs right along the California coast up to Washington?). I lowkey feel like few people ever take Connor on tour to see new things. Some of us aren't from the US so we never see it either. There's even a castle they can visit! It's only supposed to take 2 days (40 hrs) to do the whole drive but if they don't, they lose (punishment TBD by someone smarter than me) but there is a MASSIVE catch to slow them down. 

Every morning they do a challenge to see if they get bicycles or ebikes/scooters. Challenges would be something they could be really bad at: successfully catching a fish; stopping at a U-Pick fruit farm to harvest a certain weight in a limited time; complete a workout with a REALLY tough personal trainer; make enough pancakes for the crew over a campfire with only a frying pan but no spatula (pan flipping + best score from the crew judging); first to get back successfully from a coffee run (no map no phone) with everyone's order correct; getting a top 10 speedrun time on a handheld console game; find the rarest Pokemon in Pokemon Go; win at Geoguesser or chess vs a guest (can be played on a laptop and the guest is a pro). I'm sure other's have better ideas and some of mine are crap examples. I was just trying to think of things that would be difficult or publicly cringe af to slow them down and make it funny. 

If one of them fails, they have to pedal for the day but the other gets mechanical help (or they could both win or both lose). It could cause so much tension and drama for the content! I doubt very highly Connor would get on a motorbike, but  Lud loves his Vespa so that would be a valid alternative. They could even use an e-bike rental like the bois joked about on Cycleathon if renting a second Vespa is out of the question (something that doesn't require a license in the US for Connor). 

Then there would be a second challenge in the evening to see if they get to stay in a hotel or if they have to camp together that night. After a day potentially bickering over their transportation, having to lock into a team challenge would be so extra! Eating or drinking challenges where one potentially pulls more weight would be good here. Or something like successfully starting a campfire together in less than 15 minutes with no lighters or matches. Or even a scavenger hunt with clues to find the right hotel. Or figure out how to set up a really complicated tent with no instructions even if they aren't going to use it. 

They aren't really outdoorsy and would suffer/complain in a hilarious way. Can you imagine the complaining if one of them gets stuck on a bicycle, hung over from a drinking challenge, after uncomfortably sleeping in a tent the night before? Or they win a night in a hotel only to find out the only one that had reservations on short notice is REALLY bad (but the crew has a luxury RV the whole time)? Absolute cinema! 

Logistically I think this is possible and not out of their typical production budget. Lud has a big enough team for a follow vehicle (like Van Gang) or two. The bikes/scooters could go in the back of the J-truck or a small UHaul trailer behind an RV (it only needs to hold what they aren't using that day). There are plenty of restaurants and stores along the route for food/water. They have the new Switch, so gaming challenges are still included not just IRL challenges. Someone in their group of associates has to have a Steam Deck they can borrow too. It can be connected to a screen and is compatible with bluetooth controllers. It would give them access to even more games for the gauntlet. Gaming challenges will be so much harder if their mental is affected by the physical outdoor stuff. There are plenty of RV rental places in California, there must be an option with installed screens and a backup generator that can fit in the budget! 

What do you guys think? What are good morning and evening challenges to slow them down or make them suffer for content? What are the most entertaining games for portable console challenges? Is it too ambitious for this event?

Since I was little I always experienced migraines and headaches and been taking medications because of that. I know when I’m about to have it and when it get intense that it would last for days. The reason for me to take prescribed medications. My husband ( 38M) is well aware of my condition but because he sees I’m moving around taking care of the kids doing chores laughing talking he thinks I’m just faking it and nothing is wrong with me. I( 32F)  can tolerate pain but sometimes I just need some help to calm me down as I do get irritated when it gets bad. I don’t normally go to my husband as he is already dealing with work and him being in the house I want him to relax. But on the worse days it’s hard for me to be able to care for him and all I want is just some peace and quiet. I do the best I can for him make sure he gets his tea or coffee sit next to him talk to him and watch the kids ask him about his days. But I’m so tired and exhausted from the medication and it takes some time for it to go through my system and when it comes I tend to be very sleepy and dozing off. My husband is the type where he doesn’t have much patience especially towards the kids. But who does especially when they are very young ages 2 and 3. I don’t ask much from him but all I do is for him to just help me out. He says I can do it with no problem and nothing is wrong with me since he sees me doing the normal things I usually do. He then says I always complain and nag and I’m just using my migraines/ headaches as an excuse to not do much. 

Should I just not say anything to him even though he already knows my health condition and doesn’t seem to find ways to help me? And just stay quiet and continue like as if nothing is wrong with me? I’m so annoyed all I want is just some comfort from him he doesn’t even have to talk to me.

I only work because I have to. If I didn’t have to work I would be happy to do nothing at home and just be a housewife. The last time I was truly happy was when I was a stay at home dog mom for 2 years. Now I’m miserable. There’s no job in the world that’ll make me happy unless if you pay me to stay at home in the comfort of my house while I watch tv and just do whatever I want with my day. Life is so meaningless having to work. 

I cry almost everyday or get a huge sense of sadness when I go to work and I’m depressed everyday while I’m at work. I really don’t want to be here. It’s not just my job I hate. My job is OK. I just don’t like being here. I wanna go home. I don’t wanna be surrounded by a bunch of people I don’t care about. Everyday I’m so homesick. I don’t care about having a fulfilling career and I don’t care about being a boss babe. I rather be a millionaires wife. 

Everything about work I hate. I hate that I have a meaningless 9-5. I hate spending most of my day and week with a bunch of people I can’t stand and don’t care about. We spend more time at work with these people than we do at home with our family. Then the weekend goes by way too fast and we spend our weekends catching up on errands and chores. I hate that these people are so on my ass about time. I get in trouble if I’m 5 minutes late. I clock in, get coffee in the hospital which is across my department, then get scolded to not to do that and my report on time at 8 so I need to be at the department at 8 or before 8.

I’ll try to make this as short as possible. I (27f) already went on two dates with this guy (33m)(coffee and hall climbing), and I really like him. He’s not much of a talker but he’s very sweet and thoughtful, even bought me flowers on the first date. We’ve been talking online for two weeks. On our second date I invited him over to mine for a gaming evening and to cook together. 

Nothing intimate has happened yet. The closest we got to each other was hugging hello and goodbye, and when he checked my climbing harness. 

He says that he’s introverted and he seems pretty restrained. Any physical touch was initiated by me (except for when he put his arm around me because I was cold🤭).

Still, I know what society says happens on a third date, especially when it takes place at home. I know that I’m definitely not ready for something other than cuddling. I don’t think he has any expectations to kiss/ make out/ sleep together, or may be as nervous as I am..but for my peace of mind I’d like to communicate that I’m not ready for physical intimacy yet. (Background: Last time I invited someone over I didn’t set clear boundaries and was sort of coerced to go along. After, I felt used and pretty uncomfortable, and cut off contact with that guy.)

As we haven’t yet talked about anything like this I don’t want to take him by surprise and tell him - either via text or when he’s at mine - out of the blue. Do you guys have any tips?

Losing Hope.,"I don’t even know how to explain this anymore. For 2.5 years I’ve been trapped in a body that feels like it’s constantly under pressure—literally. There’s a relentless, *non-stop* pushing sensation in my upper abdomen, right in the epigastric area (just below the breastbone). It never turns into sharp pain, but it never *goes away* either. It feels like something is pressing into that area *all the time*, and it’s driving me to the edge.

It's not gas. It’s not bloating. It’s not reflux in the typical sense. I’ve been tested multiple times for *H. pylori*—always negative. My pH sits around 6–7. No burning. No classic heartburn. Just this awful internal *pressure*. Like something deep in my body is malfunctioning and no one can figure out what.

What makes it worse:

* Coffee (even a sip)
* Chocolate
* Anything spicy
* Dairy (especially awful)
* Lying on my back or sitting fully upright

I’ve spent years *sleeping in one rigid position* (always on my right side) just to reduce the pressure a little. But even then, it’s still there. Just duller. The second I shift, or try to lie normally, the pressure intensifies and sometimes triggers this horrible nervous-system reaction—like my body just spirals into discomfort and tension starting from that single spot.

Here’s what I’ve tried—and none of it has helped:

* PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole)
* H2 blockers
* Antacids
* Probiotics
* Natural stuff: DGL, aloe, glutamine, zinc carnosine, slippery elm, marshmallow root, sucralfate
* Neurological stuff: uridine, PEA, methyl B12 (because I started suspecting this might be *nerve-related*)

Still, no relief. No change.

I’ve seen specialists. GI doctors. They do the tests, tell me everything’s “normal,” and then treat me like I’m just anxious or imagining it. But I wasn't anxious when this started—this *made* me anxious. This ruined my life. I can’t work, can’t eat normally, can’t sleep normally, can’t enjoy anything anymore. And yet the medical system keeps brushing me off.

I’m posting this in desperation. Has *anyone* had this before? This constant, unrelenting pressure in the upper stomach—not pain, not acid—but a pushing sensation that feels like it's wrecking your nerves and your mind?

If you’ve found answers—*anything*—please share. I’m beyond lost.",2,1749488781.0,HiatalHernia,6,1.0,False

John: should you really be touching that, what if he notices there's a handprint on the glass and gets pissed at you
Karla: oh don't worry (takes out small towel from pocket and rubs glass) look handprint no longer exists (puts away) 
Raelin: why is he taking so long
Waiting For 2 mins
Here's door Opening and closes in the hallway and echoing footsteps
Azon: damn ro-(stops mid sentence seeing the 3) hellooo you guys I've been told you were in need of an explanation on the whole situation I've given you guys (claps hands together) please take a seat on the couch) 
All 3 sit on couch
Azon:(smiling) now i understand you 3 are all upset on being evicted out-
John: nah I was gonna move Out but you pushed The process quicker for me
Raelin: shut up and let him finish
Azon: thank you, as I was saying I know your upset, but it's not just you, it's everybody within the building 
Karla: why then-
Azon:(points figure up) I was getting there, mold has grown in the building and we need everyone to get out, there's also an infestation of termites in the walls of the building. How did anybody not know any sooner? I didn't know I couldn't tell you until I saw it myself. Come with me and I'll show you (gets up Off the couch And walks to hallway he came out of)
Walks up to the nearest wall that looks like the wallpaper was pulled off a little. Azon kneels down grabs a blue glove from his pocket and lifts up the wallpaper showing the infested mold and termites roaming around underneath the wallpaper
All 3 of them are disgusted and move back a step
Azon lets go of the wallpaper and goes to a trash can to throw away his glove
Azon: I know, very, very disgusting (body shakes) now that you’ve seen it and know why, I suggest you move as quick as possible.(walks back to his apartment)
Raelin: What if there's nowhere to go?
Azon:(looks back confused) well I can’t just let you stay here you have to leave and get out (closes door on them)
Raelin sighs closes her eyes and rubs them
Karla: I need to go do something right now and hopefully it's not going to include throwing up
John agrees and says the same thing (yeah me to) something like that
Raelin stays quiet standing there for awhile, then remembers her car needs to be fixed and leaves to call a tow truck
Azon watching through the eye hole from the door watching all 3 of them leave, then backs away and lets out a huge breath
Azon: goddamn! That took damn long (looks back at the lady from a bit ago) why did you have to let them in you damn bot (a little frustrated) 
Bot lady: They forced there way in (monotoned)
Mysterious figure walks out of the room he was in to the living room
Mysteroius: Don’t blame your android, blame yourself for letting her do to much work. Did the tech work on the wall?
Azon: Yeah, looked really disgusting (shivering from the thought of it) but they really bought that it was real
Mysterious: Good, now we wait for everyone to leave (lifts arm looking at his wrist) and then we’ll have all the time to figure out where this parasite is hiding. (a glowing outlay of the apartment building glows out from his wristband)
Azon: Man how does Julian come up with this tech

who whispered with lips like a leaky rebuttal.  
his thoughts were so tenuous, barely a thread,

his coffee? viscous, his gaze? opaque,  
his arguments drifted like steam from a fake.  
he called my taste banal, my views obtuse,  
then praised an esoteric juice cleanse in bruce.

your reasoning oblique, half-washed and rain-stained.""  
i blinked. i smiled. ""you mean it’s unclear?""  
""ah,"" he said, ineffably, ""not quite, but near.""  
  
his suit was diaphanous, threads made of mist,  
his words evanescent, then ceased to exist.  
his footnotes were recondite, thick with despair,  
his metaphors floated like pellucid air.

the thing is that i was really thinking about her on this first week away and decided to reached yesterday with a pic of a coffee shop from her hometown, asking how she was

she commented on the pic and sent me a pic of her on the beach, saying she's been enjoying the sun a lot. then, after a few minutes, she sent me a one time view pic of her with friends coming home after a party and asked, with curiosity, how my week has been

so far, so good

but i got myself feeling stupid for reaching out when, rationally, i know i shouldn't be investing into this. moreover, i feel icky toward myself for initiating communication so soon and now i just want to disappear, honestly

I’m a 26-year-old guy and I’ve had mild to moderate psoriasis since I was 18. Normally, it’s always been there in some form, but recently something weird happened, I went on a weekend trip with my parents, just to get away for a bit, and boom, my psoriasis basically vanished like snow in the sun. 😳

I’m honestly confused (but also kinda hopeful) and trying to figure out what could’ve caused it. These are some things I suspect might be triggers in my daily life, but I’m not 100% sure how realistic they are:
	•	I drink coffee with coffee creamer about 3-4 times a day
	•	My mom sometimes cooks with vegetable oils (I read that some can make psoriasis worse?)
	•	I probably don’t get enough sun
	•	I do experience stress regularly

I know it might sound a bit selfish, but it’s so hard to figure out what exactly triggers it for me. So any ideas, tips, or shared experiences would be super appreciated. 🙏

Chapter 1  
  
After her rebirth, the first thing Isabella Claymore did was fall to her knees before her parents, her voice trembling with earnest conviction.  
  
""Dad, Mom... regarding the arranged marriage with the Moretti family, I choose to marry Lucius Moretti.""  
  
Her parents exchanged bewildered glances at their daughter's unexpected request.  
  
""Isabella, honey,"" her mother said gently, ""aren't you in love with Ronan? Lucius is his uncle.""  
  
Something flickered in Isabella's eyes—a shadow of pain that made her voice catch.  
  
""It's precisely because I know the consequences of loving him that I can't afford to anymore.""  
  
""Dad, Mom, I've never asked anything of you before. As the daughter who's enjoyed all the privileges of this family, I understand that an arranged marriage is my responsibility. But this... this is the one thing I’m asking for. Just this once—please, I’m begging you.""  
  
Seeing their daughter's forehead red from kowtowing, her parents sighed and helped her to her feet. ""If you’re really sure about this, we’ll talk to the Morettis. The only thing is—Lucius is in a pretty powerful position. He might say no. You need to be ready for that.""  
  
While comforting their daughter, the Claymores prepared generous gifts for their visit to the Moretti estate.  
  
As the black sedan disappeared down the driveway, Isabella turned back toward the familiar living room, everything feeling surreal.  
  
Suddenly, her phone buzzed.  
  
\[Midnight Lounge. Come now.\]  
  
It was from Ronan Moretti, along with the bar's address. Thinking this might be the perfect opportunity to clarify the change in marriage arrangements, Isabella headed over.  
  
The moment she pushed open the private room door, a bucket of ice water came crashing down, soaking her completely.  
  
The shock of the cold water penetrated her skin, making her shiver as cruel laughter erupted around her.  
  
""Well, well, if it isn't the Claymore princess! Look at you, drenched like a drowned rat!""  
  
""Serves her right! Always chasing after Ronan like some pathetic lapdog—this is what desperate bitches get!""  
  
Ronan approached with a cold expression, his eyes dark with contempt.  
  
""Are you that desperate to marry me? The arrangement was barely discussed, and you're already pushing your parents to finalize wedding plans. Now everyone in Chicago knows about our supposed engagement. Happy now?""  
  
Isabella realized he'd misunderstood everything.  
  
She wiped the water from her face, pushing back her wet hair, and looked at him with unexpected calm.  
  
""The Claymore-Moretti alliance was always inevitable. It makes no difference which family initiates the discussion. But don't worry—this has nothing to do with you.""  
  
Ronan froze for a moment, then let out a harsh laugh. ""Nothing to do with me? Don’t tell me you actually think you’re marrying someone else. Come on—who the hell in the Moretti family would even want you?""  
  
Before Isabella could respond, the door burst open.  
  
Heyar Whitlow stumbled in, tears streaming down her face at the scene before her.  
  
""Ronan… I heard you’re getting married. I wasn’t sure if I should come, but… I just wanted to say congratulations. I truly hope you and Miss Claymore will be happy together. Forever. Really.""  
  
With that, she fled the room, her sobs echoing in the hallway.  
  
""Heyar, wait!""  
  
Ronan instantly panicked, brushing Isabella aside as he rushed after her.  
  
Isabella crashed into the coffee table, her forehead splitting open. Blood trickled down her face in a gruesome stream.  
  
As pain shot through her skull, she watched their retreating figures and memories from her past life came flooding back.  
  
In her previous life, Isabella and Ronan had grown up together, childhood sweethearts with what seemed like an unbreakable bond.  
  
When their parents mentioned the arranged marriage, Isabella remembered all of Ronan's tender care over the years and chose him without hesitation.  
  
But after the engagement was announced, his attitude toward her began to shift—from anger to indifference, and finally to disgust.  
  
Isabella couldn't understand why, but she married him anyway, believing things would improve after the wedding.  
  
Even after their daughter was born, nothing changed. Then one day, she discovered thousands of photographs of Heyar hidden in his study.  
  
That's when she realized the truth: he'd always loved the housekeeper's daughter, but their class differences made such a relationship impossible.  
  
When Heyar married another man two years later, the marriage was troubled from the start. Ronan drowned his sorrows in alcohol, mourning for her happiness.  
  
The day Heyar's husband died in a car accident was the happiest day of Ronan's life.  
  
Isabella witnessed it all, her heart breaking piece by piece, but she forced herself to focus solely on raising their daughter.  
  
Until the kidnapping.  
  
Both their daughter and Heyar's son were taken. When the kidnappers forced Ronan to choose which child to save, he hesitated for only seconds before choosing the boy—who wasn't even his blood relative.  
  
The next moment, their daughter was pushed from the rooftop.  
  
Isabella watched her child die and threw herself from the same building.  
  
Now, given a second chance, she refused to torture herself again. She would cut all ties with Ronan Moretti.  
  
Back in the private room, the crowd continued their cruel mockery.  
  
""You can't force love, right? I mean, sure—he might marry her, but what’s the point if he spends every night in someone else’s bed?""  
  
""She chased his ass for years just to end up alone in a mansion, waiting on a man who’s never showing up. huh? Serves her right.""  
  
A sudden buzz cut through the laughter—Isabella’s phone was ringing.  
  
A message from her parents appeared on the screen:  
  
""Isabella! Lucius agreed! The wedding is in two weeks!""  
  
Her usually composed parents had used three exclamation points, showing just how shocked and thrilled they were by Lucius Moretti's acceptance.  
  
Isabella felt a wave of relief wash over her.  
  
She stood up, steadied herself, and faced the room full of mockers with newfound determination in her eyes.  
  
“My future has nothing to do with you—or with Ronan Moretti.""  
  
""Tell him this: I'm getting married in two weeks. And he won't be the groom.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After leaving the bar, Isabella went to the hospital to treat her wound.  
  
When she returned home, she gathered everything related to Ronan—photos, letters, gifts—and packed them all away in boxes.  
  
Her parents arrived just as she was sealing the last container.  
  
""Isabella,"" her mother asked gently, ""have you truly let go of Ronan? You're really over him?""  
  
Seeing their daughter nod without hesitation, both parents visibly relaxed.  
  
""Glad to hear that,"" her father said with a smile. ""Lucius is busy overseas, but the Moretti family arranged a video call today to finalize everything.""  
  
""Lucius is definitely more mature and put-together than Ronan—honestly, he’s a much better fit for you. We never even considered him an option, thought someone like him would never go for this. So yeah, we were pretty shocked when he said yes without hesitation.""  
  
Isabella's eyes filled with tears.  
  
From the moment she'd made her decision, she'd known Lucius would say yes.  
  
In her past life, the age difference and his cold, commanding presence had kept everyone at a distance—including Isabella. They rarely interacted outside of family gatherings.  
  
All she'd known was that he was completely devoted to his work, having built a business empire from nothing, and had never married.  
  
When he died by suicide at thirty-five, they found a stack of love letters while clearing out his belongings.  
  
Each one was addressed ""To my Stella,"" and no one in the Moretti family knew who was stella.  
  
Only Isabella knew. She was born on a night full of falling stars, and “Stella” was the nickname her grandpa always used—just his special name for her.  
  
She'd never realized that the cold, unreachable man had loved her silently for an entire lifetime.  
  
Now that fate had given her a second chance, she wanted to give them both an opportunity.  
  
Lost in thought, she barely noticed her parents approaching with an elegant gift box.  
  
""Sweetie, tomorrow's your birthday,"" her mother explained warmly. ""Lucius couldn't fly back in time, so he had his assistant retrieve this from his study. Do you like it?""  
  
Inside lay a breathtakingly brilliant diamond ring.  
  
Isabella recognized it immediately—""Stardust,"" the most expensive engagement ring sold at Sotheby's in the past fifty years.  
  
She'd seen it once at an exhibition and never forgotten its beauty.  
  
That Lucius would send such a priceless gift filled her heart with unexpected warmth.  
  
In her past life, after their engagement, Ronan had never given her another gift.  
  
She'd forgotten what it felt like to receive something precious from someone who cared.  
  
The next evening, Isabella's birthday celebration began promptly at seven in Chicago's most luxurious hotel.  
  
Guests offered their congratulations, and with the marriage arrangement finally settled, Isabella felt a weight lift from her shoulders. For the first time in months, she found herself genuinely smiling.  
  
Then commotion erupted near the entrance, and every head turned toward the door.  
  
Isabella followed their gaze and froze. Ronan had arrived—with Heyar on his arm.  
  
But that wasn't the most humiliating part. The worst was yet to come: a group of Ronan's friends marched through the crowd carrying an enormous placard.  
  
In bold letters across the center, it read:  
  
HYPOCRITE  
  
For: Isabella Claymore  
  
Guests pressed forward to gawk, whispering and pointing.  
  
Isabella's face went pale.  
  
Her hands clenched into fists as she stared at the troublemakers, her voice cutting through the noise like ice.  
  
""What the hell is this?""  
  
The group sneered at her, deliberately raising their voices for everyone to hear.  
  
""Oh please, you tell us! Yesterday you swore Ronan wasn’t the groom, but the second he got home, his whole family was already knee-deep in wedding plans. Seriously, who plays hard to get like you do, Princess? This sign fits perfectly!""  
  
""Please, we all knew she was faking it yesterday. She’s been chasing Ronan for years—girl left her pride at the door a long time ago. And now she suddenly doesn’t want him? Yeah, right. Classic move. Like, who else is she gonna marry? He’s the only Moretti her age.""  
  
Cruel laughter rippled through the ballroom.  
  
Ronan's expression was stone-cold as he addressed her. ""Isabella, stop with these hypocritical games. Don't think this will get my attention. Once we’re married, you’ll have the Moretti name—don’t expect a damn thing more.""  
  
She'd heard those exact words in her previous life.  
  
And he'd kept his promise. Seven years of marriage, and the name was all she'd ever received.  
  
The crowd buzzed with gossip as Isabella took a shaky breath and raised her voice.  
  
""Ronan Moretti! I don't need your name. Listen carefully—you are not my groom, and it's not with someone my age. It's with your—""  
  
Before she could finish, chaos erupted.  
  
Heyar suddenly clutched her face, red welts spreading across her skin as she collapsed into Ronan's arms.  
  
""Ronan… I—I can’t breathe… why are there so many hyacinths? You know I’m allergic…""  
  
Hyacinths were Isabella's favorite flowers, and the ballroom was filled with elaborate arrangements.  
  
Hearing Heyar's increasingly labored breathing, Ronan panicked, calling her name frantically before sweeping her into his arms.  
  
As he rushed toward the exit, he shouted two commands:  
  
To Isabella: ""When we’re married, there will be no hyacinths—ever. Not in the house, not at events, not anywhere.""  
  
To his friends: ""After I leave, destroy this entire party!""  
  
""Got it, boss. Consider it done.""  
  
The moment he disappeared, the group descended like vandals, grabbing chairs and wreaking havoc.  
  
The birthday cake splattered across the marble floor, crystal glasses shattered against walls, and flowers were trampled into pulp as guests fled in terror.  
  
""Stop! You have no right to destroy my birthday party! Stop!""  
  
""You're marrying our boy Ronan, sweetheart! Wife obeys husband—whatever he says goes! Ha ha ha!""  
  
Isabella screamed until her voice gave out, but couldn't stop the rampage. Her protests only brought more cruel laughter.  
  
Eventually, every guest had fled.  
  
Her birthday party ended in ruins.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
For the next several days, Isabella locked herself in her room with red-rimmed eyes, refusing to see anyone.  
  
When her parents learned what Ronan had done at the birthday party, they felt even more certain that not choosing him had been the right decision. They wanted to confront the Moretti family directly, but Isabella, who had barely stepped out of her room in days, stopped them.  
  
With the wedding so close, she didn't want any more complications.  
  
After calming her parents, she left the house carrying a design sketch.  
  
She hadn't been hiding in her room obsessing over Ronan—he meant nothing to her now. Instead, she'd been designing a wedding ring for Lucius, crafted by her own hand.  
  
She knew how much “Stardust” meant to him, and she wanted to give him something just as meaningful in return.  
  
She gave the design to the family's jeweler, asking him to have a master craftsman create it personally.  
  
But when the agreed deadline arrived, the ring never came.  
  
When Isabella inquired, she learned that Ronan had visited the shop days earlier. He'd spotted the ring immediately, asked a few questions, then simply taken it.  
  
His parting words: ""It's for me anyway. No need to call Isabella for pickup.""  
  
The staff, knowing about the Claymore-Moretti engagement, hadn't intervened.  
  
Isabella's heart sank like a stone.  
  
She rushed to the Moretti estate to retrieve the ring, only to find Heyar sitting among piles of delivery boxes, cooing sweetly.  
  
""Mr. Ronan, you secretly cleared out my shopping cart again! You're so sweet—I'll never be able to repay you.""  
  
""I do it because I want to. You don't need to repay anything. And I've told you before—stop calling me that. Use my name.""  
  
Heyar blushed prettily as she whispered, ""Ronan.""  
  
Watching their intimate exchange, Isabella didn't even blink as she strode through the door.  
  
Hearing footsteps, Ronan looked up and frowned.  
  
""What are you doing here?""  
  
""The wedding ring you took. Give it back.""  
  
Seeing Isabella's outstretched hand, Ronan raised an eyebrow.  
  
""It's gone.""  
  
Isabella's gaze sharpened, her voice hardening. ""What do you mean, gone?""  
  
Before Ronan could make up an excuse, Heyar spoke up from the floor, her voice timid.  
  
""Oh… Miss Claymore, I just saw online that wedding rings are great for opening packages, so I used it for a few… hundred. It’s a little scratched now. I mean… if it still matters to you, you can have it back?""  
  
She opened her palm, revealing the once-beautiful ring now marred with deep scratches.  
  
Ronan had given her wedding ring—designed with love for another man—to Heyar as a glorified box cutter?  
  
Rage ignited in Isabella's chest, spreading through her entire body.  
  
Unable to control herself any longer, she stared at the two uncaring faces before her, her eyes blazing.  
  
""“Ronan, what the hell gave you the right to take something that wasn’t yours? And you, Heyar—how dare you treat it like garbage? Do either of you even understand what basic respect means?""  
  
Seeing her break down over a simple ring ruined Ronan's good mood, irritation creeping into his voice.  
  
""The wedding ring was meant for me anyway. What are you making such a fuss about?""  
  
""Oh, and I've decided we'll just get the marriage certificate. No ceremony. So your ring design was pointless—don't waste any more effort.""  
  
His dismissive attitude made Isabella clench her fists as she declared once more:  
  
""Ronan, that wedding ring was never meant for you!""  
  
""If not me, then who? Isabella, enough. You’re taking this way too far!""  
  
As he spoke, Ronan carelessly tossed the damaged ring aside and pulled Heyar toward the door.  
  
""Don't waste time arguing with her. Heyar, didn't you say you wanted to learn to drive? Come on, I'll teach you.""  
  
Watching them leave, Isabella felt waves of anger and helplessness crash over her. She wanted to chase after them, but first she had to find the ring.  
  
It took thirty minutes of searching before she found it in a flower bed.  
  
Carefully tucking it into her pocket, she left immediately. There wasn't time to create a new one—she'd have to find someone to repair this one and hope it could be restored.  
  
Just as she stepped outside the estate, she heard a strange noise.  
  
Looking up, she saw a car barreling straight toward her. Isabella's eyes widened in shock.  
  
The impact sent her flying ten meters, landing in a spreading pool of blood.  
  
Heyar climbed out of the driver's seat, putting on a show of terror.  
  
""Oh no, oh no! I didn’t mean to! I’m still new at driving—I must’ve hit the gas instead of the brake… how stupid of me! This is awful… there’s so much blood! Miss Claymore looks really bad… Ronan, is she gonna be okay?""  
  
Seeing the stone steps stained crimson, Ronan frowned but pulled Heyar into his arms, comforting her gently.  
  
""She's fine. Isabella's always been dramatic—this is just another performance. Just ignore her. She'll stop pretending when she gets tired of it. Don't be scared, Heyar. Don't cry.""  
  
Through her haze of pain, hearing those words made Isabella feel cold to her very core. Tears she could no longer hold back began to fall.  
  
Ronan... I thought that even if you didn't love me, after all our years of growing up together, you'd feel something. Anything.  
  
But you'd rather comfort Heyar than care whether I live or die.  
  
Why did I ever fall in love with you in my past life?  
  
She tried to reach for her phone to call for help, but her strength gave out completely.  
  
Endless darkness crashed over her, drowning her consciousness.  
  
When she opened her eyes again, it was the next day.  
  
Shortly after she awoke, a doctor entered with her chart, his voice stern.  
  
""Why wasn't she brought in immediately after the accident? Making her lose all that blood before seeking medical attention—that's completely irresponsible.""  
  
Remembering the scene before she'd lost consciousness, Isabella moved her lips but could only manage a bitter smile. How could she explain that her childhood sweetheart had been too busy comforting another woman to save her life?  
  
The doctor didn't press the issue, simply continuing, ""Where's your husband? He needs to handle the admission paperwork.""  
  
Still groggy from anesthesia, Isabella answered without thinking.  
  
""He's overseas.""  
  
The moment the words left her mouth, the hospital room door swung open.  
  
Ronan stood in the doorway, staring at her intently.  
  
""Who's overseas""

Guys would ask me to prom as a joke on the bus in the mornings. Everyone had it out for me. A girl threw her coffee on me on the bus because I wouldn't give her my spot. I genuinely think about those years to this day and how fucking traumatic they were. I would wake up at 5 in the morning everyday to drive to the bus in my ugly little uniform, go to school, and get back on that bus and go home again. My mom would track me constantly, and would take my phone at 9 pm every night. Meanwhile my dad was incredibly abusive all throughout these years. I had shitty friends who never hungout and just wanted to be with their boyfriends outside of school. And then of course covid happened. I was so unexposed to boys that when I was 17, a guy invited me to his car and jacked off in front of me for 15 minutes in his car and I THOUGHT THAT WAS NORMAL. Keep in mind I'd never even had my first kiss. Now I'm in my early 20s and I'm honestly so screwed up from those years and I'm deeply sad that I never get them back. My parents sent me off to college after and I was literally so not ready to be in that environment on so many levels. My highschool gpa was screwed up but my parents had convinced me prior that going to a private all girls school would get me into a good college. Spoiler alert: it didn't. Now it's time to work for the rest of my life. It wasn't the best of times and the worst of times, it was straight up the worst of times. Like I seriously can't think of one good thing besides the one time I snuck out to go to the grocery store at night because I had no friends.",3,1749488063.0,GenZ,4,1.0,False

Within a few hours I was lying on the bathroom floor trying not to throw up as my broken brain rode the world’s shittiest teacup ride.

In those four years I have told tens of doctors and specialists that I never had vertigo before the vaccine, and that my migraines (which were incredibly rare pre-vaccine) never made me dizzy. I was dismissed by every single one of them. They all told me it must have been something dormant in my system that just happened to be triggered that day.

My life has irreparably changed. I’m scared to go into shops because the heat and lights set off my vertigo. I can’t drive or drink coffee or even plan trips too far from home in case I have a flare up. My blood runs cold when I feel even a hint of a headache starting because I know my week is about to be hell on earth. I’m only 31 and my life has been taken over by vertigo and migraines and fear.

I’m not an anti vaxxer. I think vaccines are crucial to humanity, and I understand that I am just one of the unlucky ones. But it’d be nice to have just one person look me in the eye and tell me they believe me. That’s all I’m asking for.

But not about puzzles or weird tumors or Vicodin snowstorms.
No. This time, it was about them.
Wilson.
That clumsy, hot-as-hell, emotionally suppressed nerd with tragic fashion sense and cheekbones that could carve glass.

They were staring at him—longingly. Dreamily. Dangerously.
Come on, Dr. Doggy Gimp Dog House,” they whispered with a smirk that curled like a demon’s pinky.
“Put on your little gimp suit and let’s cuddle.”

House started barking.

He woke up in a cold sweat, horrified and a little turned on.

“God,” he muttered. “They’re never gonna dominate my emotionally constipated, slightly damaged body. Are they?”

Meanwhile, at the hospital…
Wilson was daydreaming in the breakroom, sipping old coffee and trying not to spiral into gay longing.

“How do I become a dominant nb baddie hopelessly obsessed with that sarcastic little bastard House?”
“That emotionally unavailable, limping bastard with weaponized eyebrows.”

Their thoughts were cut off by the sudden realization:

“Oh sh*t. I just cut this patient’s heart in half.”

“CODE BLUE!!! CODE BLUE!!!” they screamed, throwing their clipboard across the ER.

But when they saw House walking down the hallway in a godawful hoodie and his usual smirk?

They froze.

“S-So… what are you doing this weekend?” they asked, voice cracking like a teen in a queer coming-of-age novel.

House blinked, suspiciously pink in the cheeks.

“I don’t know. Probably something cooler than you! Laser tag. Margarita pizza. Afterwards.”

Wilson narrowed their eyeliner-clad eyes like a bisexual anime villain.

“Oh yeah? Well guess what, loser… I’m going to a furry convention. Then laser tag. Then PEPPERONI PIZZA, B.I.C.H.T.”

House choked on air. That was new.

“You… I… mh–…”

Suddenly, Wilson shoved the patient gurney aside and yanked House into a supply closet.

Their faces collided. The kiss was gay, desperate, and tasted like hospital-grade lip balm.

“You’re hot,” House mumbled.

“Yeah,” Wilson smirked. “You’re… passable, I guess.”

1l79u55,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l79u55/hm_welcome_to_your_kitchen/,[HM] Welcome to Your Kitchen,"*Thump*

Nick turned over in bed. Back to sleep.

*Thump thump*

*It was probably nothing,* he thought. He lay in his queen size bed and listened for more noise. Nothing. He started to doze off again.

*Thump thump thump*

Nick bolted wide awake. It was a new house. He had moved in a few weeks ago. He had heard a few creaks and groans before, but this was different. More rhythmic.

He wiped the sand from eyes and checked his phone for the time. *2:30 AM*. He put his phone in his pocket and made for the bedroom door.

*Thump thump thump*

*It was probably just an animal,* he thought. He still had to check. A first time homebuyer at thirty-two years of age, he felt he needed to do the responsible thing. Probably a raccoon. Best case scenario he could scare it away. Worst case scenario, he’d be putting in a call to animal control and getting an extra cup of coffee before work in a few hours.

Nick made his way down the stairs and saw a faint red light in the kitchen. Did he leave his oven on?

He heard a shuffling and noticed a large amorphous shape had replaced his dining room table. He walked towards it, into the kitchen.

*CLUNK*

Bright searing lights turned on all over his kitchen and conjoined dining room right as he stepped through the threshold, as if he had stepped on a tripwire that activated them. His eyes took a second to adjust to the blinding brightness. He looked around where his dining room table had been, he saw two rows of people in theater-style seats facing the kitchen. He recognized all of them.

His third-grade teacher Mrs. Pemberton, the guy who cut him off in traffic last Tuesday, and someone who looked exactly like the stock photo model from his insurer’s website.

He saw his college roommate Chad, who still owed him $50 he borrowed and lost in a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme.

Even his great aunt Gertrude, sitting in the corner and crocheting a sweater that read “It’s Your Kitchen, Nick”.

“*Wait, didn’t she die like 3 years ago?*” Nick thought to himself.

They all watched him with an expectant look. The giant flood lights illuminated his kitchen, where he saw two podiums. One was empty, at the other was a middle aged man with a combover and too much bronzer in an electric blue tuxedo who held a long baton with a small sphere at its end. It was a microphone.

“What the hell! How did you people get-” Nick started.

“Hey Nick!” The man in the blue tuxedo interrupted. “I’m sure you’re wondering what we’re doing here, isn’t that right folks?”

A din of agreement and nods of varying enthusiasm came from the crowd that almost paradoxically fit inside his modestly sized dining room. One man, who Nick recognized as his car mechanic from back when he lived in Boston, shouted “That’s right!”.

“Well, Nick, my name is Chuck Bazzleton,” The man at the podium said, his voice booming over speakers Nick couldn’t find, “and we’re here too play…” Chuck smiled and pointed the mic at the crowd.

“IT’S! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd roared in unison.

Nick looked around and felt a wave of vertigo.

*How did these people get here? There was a production crew. A camera man. An “on air” sign glowed red where he had hung his NASA deep space photo calendar.* After a moment, Nick’s awe and amusement turned to anger.

“No. No. I have work in the morning. I am calling the cops.” Nick said calmly.

*A collective gasp from the crowd.* Nick took his phone out of his pocket and dialed 911.

“Now, Nick, that isn’t very sportsmanlike of you” Chuck crooned. “What do we think of that folks?”

The crowd booed and a few showed their thumbs down for Nick.

“Why don’t you just be a good sport and play the game, Nick?” Chuck added as Nick waited for the call to connect. Nick heard a momentary dial tone.

“911 What’s your emergency?” The operator asked.

“Yes I’m at 121 Chestnut street, and people have broken into my home.” Nick answered calmly, a smirk growing on his face.

“Just play the game, Nick” the operator said calmly before hanging up.

“Wait! What? Hello?” Nick exclaimed into the phone, as he looked around the room.

“You heard what the nice dispatcher said, Nick” said Chuck Bazzleton. He patted his hand on the empty podium. “Why don’t you just come over here and play. The prize tonight is-”

“No. No!” Nick interrupted. “So you have someone on the inside. I don’t care. I know where the police station is. I’ll just drive over there and tell them”.

“I wouldn’t recommend that, Nick.” Chuck said, his voice growing a bit more hostile. “Hey folks, what do we call a contestant that doesn’t want to play?”

“LOSER!” The crowd said in Unison.

Nick put on his shoes and grabbed his car keys. He opened his front door, but instead of seeing his quiet suburban street, the front door opened up into, his kitchen.

Nick ran to the back door. Before he opened it, he had a feeling he knew what he would see on the other side of the door.

When Nick opened the door, he didn’t see his backyard. He saw exactly what he had seen out the front door.

He felt a dark and foreboding dread build in his gut. He turned back to his kitchen and looked at the empty podium. Chuck and the crowd looked at him longingly. Chuck motioned for Nick to come on stage.

“What is it we say folks?” Chuck said, holding back laughter and pointing his microphone to the crowd.

“IT’S! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd cheered.

“That’s right.” Chuck said through eerily white teeth “And that’s all there is!”

Nick walked back to the kitchen. He saw they had moved his trash can to make room for the two podiums. He stood behind the podium and looked back at the crowd, dejected. Chuck beamed at Nick as cheesy game show music played from the speakers Nick still couldn’t find.

“So glad to have you here Nick. Now tell us, where do you hail from?” Chuck asked.

Nick was incredulous.

“Here. I come from right here. We’re in my house.” Nick said waving his hands around at, well, everything.

“That’s right! We’re in your home! 121 Chestnut, isn’t that right folks?” Chuck exclaimed. “Or it wouldn’t be” He turned the mic to the crowd as Nick closed his eyes in despair.

“IT’S ! YOUR! KITCHEN!” The crowd boomed.

Eyes closed, Nick began to whisper to himself “This isn’t real. This is a dream. Just wake up Nick. It was probably those noodles”.

“Nick, I assure you this IS real” Chuck said. “It has nothing to do with those nine-day-old noodles you had for lunch the other day. Now are you ready to play the game?”

“Sure” Nick said with a resigned shrug.

The crowd cheered.

The lights felt hot on Nick’s skin as Chuck took out some cue cards.

“Ok Nick we’re ready to start playing.” Chuck said as he looked down at the first cue card. “What… is your biggest regret?”

As soon as Chuck had asked, all of the lights, save the spotlight trained on Nick, dimmed. Chuck shoved the microphone in Nick’s face.

“Is this hell?” Nick asked.

The crowd erupted into raucous laughter, and Chuck brought the microphone back to his own face.

“Well that’s not the answer is it folks?” Chuck asked.

“NO!” The crowd sang.

“Now let’s try this again.” Chuck said, the grin widening on his face. “What is your biggest regret?”

“I don’t know.” Nick started. The crowd began to boo. “Ok let me think! Let me think. My biggest regret was probably… Not getting my masters in engineering”.

A loud siren rang as soon as Nick was done talking.

“That is incorrect!” Chuck said with a mischievous grin. “Your biggest regret was breaking up with Janice. She was such a nice girl, you really could have made a life with her.”

“Wait what? How do you know what my-“ Nick started.

“Alright folks,” Chuck interrupted “that was round one, now it’s time for a word from our sponsors”. He smiled into the camera and froze for a moment as the cheesy theme music played again. The lights dimmed, and a serious voice came from everywhere and nowhere.

*“Alright people! That’s commercial, we’re back in five.”*

In an instant, there were two people standing on either side of Chuck Bazzleton. One patted his face and seemed to be applying makeup while the other handed him a bottle of water. The water had a label that just said “It’s Your Kitchen” in plain black text over a white background.

After the makeup artist and assistant walked off to god knows where, Bazzleton turned to Nick, his voice gravelly, his smile more subdued. “You’re doing great kid. The camera loves you.”

“What the hell is going on! How do *you* know my biggest regret? Why can’t I leave?” Nick exclaimed.

Chuck turned to the crowd, pointed a thumb at Nick and asked “How about those first timer jitters, folks? Huh?” With a chuckle.

Nick heard a voice he recognized from the crowd. It was his former employer from the power plant, Mike Schmidt, “Just play the game Nick! Don’t overthink it!”

Nick took his phone out of his pocket and attempted to call his dad.

“You really think that’s gonna do anything?” Chuck said with a sneer.

The phone started to ring before blinking an “out of service” message. Nick tried to call again, but the phone ran out of battery. He had been charging it next to his bed all night.

“How is this possible? Why are you here?” Nick screamed. The crowd seemed unfazed. He took a soup ladle off of his counter and started destroying the podium. He must have hit it a dozen times, the cheap fiberboard coming apart. He struck the lights, shouting like a feral animal. He had destroyed two of them and began laughing maniacally.

“Whose… kitchen… is it… Now!” He exclaimed as he destroyed the set, the crowd now looking on with mild interest and disapproval. He pointed the ladle out to the crowd. “And why is my great aunt here? What the FUCK is that?” He shouted. Gertrude didn’t even look up from her crocheting.

He turned back to Chuck Bazzleton and looked down and to his right. The podium he had just destroyed stood there with no visible sign of damage. The lights were on again, not a scratch to be seen.

He pointed the ladle at Chuck Bazzleton’s face, and shouted at the top of his lungs “WHAT IN THE FUCK IS GOING ON?”

Chuck, completely unmoved by Nick’s outburst, shrugged, lean forward, and said “I don’t know, kid. It’s just another gig for me.”

Nick gripped the large metal ladle in both hands like a baseball bat and hit Chuck square in the jaw.

The man went down like a sack of potatoes. Blood pooled on the floor as Nick looked down. He heard the clunk of the spotlight turning back on and felt the heat on his neck.

The voice came again. It wasn’t from the speakers. It almost seemed to come from earbuds in Nick’s ears. But he wasn’t wearing earbuds.

*“Alright folks and were back in five, four, three…”*

Nick saw the camera man count two and one with his hand. Nick turned around to see Chuck Bazzleton, completely unscathed, standing at his podium smiling his irritatingly charming grin.

The theme music played.

“Alright folks, welcome back, were here with Nick tonight, and it’s time to play…”

1l79tac,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l79tac/pallid_shore/,Pallid Shore,"I wasn’t even supposed to be in that row.

Our access schedule is tightly rotated—metadata inventories, environmental checks, reboxing for degradation. You get your assignment, you clock in, you don't wander.

Row 12-D glitched during my pull request, and I was redirected to what we call the Long-Term Displacement Vaults. That’s where the box turned up.

It was tucked at the bottom of a tall rack under a false label: AGRI-EXPORT: CORN 1937–1939. No barcode, just a thin red ribbon looped through the file handle. That’s usually how they flagged it back in the ‘40s—before color coding systems were formalized. Red meant “unclassified, but keep out of reach.”

I opened it. Inside were brittle, yellowing folders stamped with a different heading: PALLID SHORE

Beneath that, in smaller type:
“Initiated 1949 – Site 14 Coastal Operations Annex”
It sounded like something to do with naval intelligence, maybe weather monitoring or shoreline logistics. But the paper didn’t match any logistics format I knew. It smelled like damp basements and metal filing drawers left untouched for decades.

The first folder was labeled POST-BROADCAST CIVILIAN ATMOSPHERICS – WOTW, Oct. ’38. Inside: thin carbon copies, onion skin paper, typed in courier, margins filled with stamped classifications like “EYES ONLY” and “INTERNAL PSYCH BRANCH – TEMP FILE.” It looked like OSS chatter—jumpy, semi-coded, full of clipped phrases and strange allusions.

Most of it was compiled months after the War of the Worlds panic. Notes, memos, incident summaries. The kind of language that made everything sound tidy, even when it wasn’t:

“Initial audio fiction broadcast yielded regional destabilization. Civilian agitation limited but instructive. Noted: 2hr duration of mass belief in atmospheric assault. Consider utility for counter-narrative planning.”

“Public suggestibility demonstrated in absence of direct threat. Aerial mythos engagement high. Sociological camouflage potential viable.”

“Recommend experimental amplification: controlled leaks, optical fabrication. Scope to be aligned with post-theater intelligence recovery (see: Berlin asset lists – V-Waffe div.)”

One memo caught my attention. It was marked “OSS–NAVINT Intersect, 1946” and listed several German terms I half-recognized from a Cold War seminar—Flugscheibe, Gerät 46, and something labeled U-Projekt 12: Atlantic Retrieval.

There was no direct mention of UFOs. Not yet. But there was this:

“Soviet and civilian interception of test materials increasingly probable. Recommend supplementary myth to mitigate pattern recognition. Develop programmatic disinformation vector via emergent aviation anomalies.”

“Directive codename: PALLID SHORE. Initial operations to commence via press dispersals, photographic fabrications, and folklore injection.”

Folklore injection.

It felt like I had swallowed something dry and jagged.

Beneath the memos, I felt a shift—the texture changed. That unmistakable smooth, heavy feel of old photographic paper, gone soft at the edges with time.

I brushed back the last few pages and found a stack of 8x10 prints, each slipped between thin waxy sheets. No labels. Few captions. The hum of something carefully staged.

The first photo showed a metal disc—classic saucer shape—propped on cinder blocks in what looked like a soundstage. Floodlights. Painted backdrop. A man in coveralls holding a clipboard stood beside it, partially turned, face obscured. Behind him, a wooden rigging system—not for flight, but for camera work.

The next was worse. A mock classic alien figure, maybe three feet tall. Big head. Bulging eyes. But up close, the illusion cracked: seams at the neck, what looked like stitched vinyl arms. The doll stood on a folding table, surrounded by men in military dress.

One of the photos had a typed sticker on the back:
Studio: Warner Bros. – Burbank Lot 3
Contract: PALLID SHORE, Phase II
Set Supervisor: Redacted

I kept flipping. The photos got bolder.

A technician applying gloss paint to latex “skin.” Another adjusting a wire support behind the knees of a slouched, limp grey figure. The background changed—sometimes it was a desert set, sometimes a forest.

One envelope inside the folder held receipts—contracted work from Ideal Toy Company for “posable figures, non-articulated, child-scale.” Another from Western Effects Ltd., detailing “metallic domes, 2.5m diameter, interior shells hollow—camera only.”

I was sweating.

There were posed crash photos, too. A broken saucer shell lying in dirt, with fake scorch marks and a singed bush. On the edge of the frame, someone had carelessly left a thermos.

The kind of mistake people make when they’ve done something too many times.

I put the prints down.

The psyop wasn’t just rumor control.

They’d built the myth frame by frame.

I slid the prints back between their sheets, careful not to smudge the corners. The ache in my knees hit me all at once—hot, stiff, deep. I must have been kneeling for over an hour.

I closed the folder gently. Replaced it exactly where I’d found it. I even gave the whole stack a neat little pat, the way we’re trained to do in box prep orientation, like the pages were just old budget manifests or train schedules.

There are cameras in every corridor. They don’t record sound. But someone watching closely would notice a deviation—too much time in one row, unusual posture, a missed scheduled return.

So I moved slowly. Deliberately. I checked a few adjacent labels. Tapped the edge of another file box like I was counting stock. I even whistled under my breath, something tuneless and forced, just in case.

Then I walked.

The hallways curve slightly, just enough to fool your sense of direction. There are no windows, no clocks, and the fluorescent lights hum just low enough to feel like pressure in your skull. I turned right, then right again, passed the laminated sign for Row 14-F, then descended the shallow ramp that leads to staff commons.

The break room is what you'd expect—linoleum, government-issue chairs, a single vending machine that eats your change.

Ed was already in there, hunched over a magazine about trout fishing, chewing on a green apple like he had all the time in the world. He nodded at me, not lifting his eyes from the page.

“You’re still down in the D rows?” he asked, like he was asking about the weather.

“Yeah,” I said. My voice sounded normal. I was grateful for that. “Some old ag files. Corn shipments.”

He grunted, took another bite. Crunch echoed off the tile.

I poured myself bad coffee, sipped just enough to feel real, then left.

The ride home was quiet. No music. I kept replaying the photos in my head—the doll’s stitched hands, the desert backdrop, the thermos left in the frame like some cosmic joke.

When I got inside, I sat at my laptop. Opened a blank browser tab.

Typed:
pallid shore project ufo

Then I froze.

If this was real—if what I saw wasn’t some elaborate archival prank—then a search from my home IP would flag. Maybe not today. Maybe not for weeks. But someone, somewhere, would see it.

I closed the tab.

Tomorrow, or next week, I’d find a library across state lines, maybe a net café, if those still exist. Somewhere with no trace. Somewhere no one knows my name.

I needed to know how deep this went.

But I already knew one thing for sure:

There was more to this ...

I planned the drive like a man casing a crime.

No phone. Left it on my kitchen counter face-down, next to the toaster. I wiped down the countertop just in case. Grabbed a jacket I hadn’t worn in months. Swapped my usual car keys for a spare set I’d quietly copied from my neighbor’s garage-hung ’99 Dodge Ram—the kind of truck that blends in anywhere and has no GPS to track.

I took the back roads. No interstate. Just grey light through late autumn trees and AM static on the dash. I drove for hours, crossing two state lines before pulling into a small town called Haddonville—one of those places where gas pumps are manual and no one looks you in the eye unless you speak first.

Their public library was exactly what I needed—no cameras, no Wi-Fi, a smell like old encyclopedias and hand sanitizer. The front desk clerk was too bored to notice I signed in with a fake name.

I typed “Pallid Shore” into their ancient 'web' computers that still had one of those big CRT monitors.

Nothing.

Not one article. Not one index card. Not even a typo-corrected suggestion.

No search results—just that blank “no matches found” line blinking back at me like it had been waiting for me to try.

I scrolled through adjacent keywords, just in case:
naval psyops, ufo fabrication, Wunderwaffe capture, OSS deception programs.

Still nothing.

That night, I barely slept. I kept seeing the doll’s hands, the seam behind its ear. How meticulous it all was.

And I kept thinking: if it doesn’t exist online, maybe it only ever existed on paper.

The next Monday, back at work, I kept it slow. Normal.

Did my rounds. Logged inventory. Spoke just enough to be forgettable.

By mid-afternoon, I made my move.

I flagged down Russell—junior archivist, quiet kid, always chewing on his badge lanyard.

Told him I needed to confirm a potential misfile in the Personnel–Projects crossover boxes, something from the P-section that might’ve been cross-listed before the FOIA standardization.

He nodded, half-listening, and waved me off with a clipboard.

By 3:10, I was at the old card catalog, tucked behind the microfilm cabinets in Row 7-C. Nobody used it anymore. The drawers were stiff, the wood splintered where the varnish had dried out decades ago.

I pulled open the one labeled P–Q.

Near the back, I found it. A single yellowing card, handwritten in tight, clinical script:

PALLID SHORE – Defense Narrative Simulation (1949–1970)
See Also: Strategic Fabrications Unit – “Shoreline Projects”

There was no barcode.

But there was a stamped number.

Not Row 19-G.

Lower Annex 3 – Sublevel E (Vault Reference: P-SHORE.04)

I froze.

I’d never heard of a Sublevel E.

The archive goes down four sublevels on the system map. But we’re only cleared through C. I’d never seen D, and E wasn’t even listed.

I ran my finger across the card again, like the number might disappear.

It didn’t.

And I knew—whatever this was, it didn’t want to be found again.

The next day, I waited until late afternoon—when the floors thin out, and the admin staff upstairs starts logging out early. I ran a fake cross-reference request on an outdated terminal to justify a trip to Sublevel D.

The elevator rattled as it descended. Floor lights ticked by: A, B, C… D. The doors opened with a hiss and a mechanical stutter.

Sublevel D was colder than I remembered. Quieter, too. The hum of machinery above faded into a deadened stillness, like sound didn’t carry right down here.

I walked past the usual shelving banks and turned down an unlit service corridor. Halfway down, I spotted it.

A fire escape door.
Painted gray. Dented at the bottom. No camera above it.

No lock either.

I pressed the bar, and it opened with a metallic sigh.

Behind it: a narrow stairwell, the kind that makes you feel like you’re trespassing into history. Cold concrete. Rust along the rail. And below me, just one more flight of steps disappearing into dark.

I went down.

At the bottom was another door—older, made of brushed steel. No keypad. No badge reader.

Just a yellowed sign, bolted to the wall beside it:

⚠ ACCESS RESTRICTED
ARCHIVAL RETAIN: LEVEL E – NONPUBLIC HOLDINGS
AUTHORIZED CLEARANCE ONLY – NARA INTERNAL BRANCH

By order of Strategic Records Command, 1974

The lettering was faded. Corners peeling. But the sign hadn’t been touched in decades.

I pushed the door open.

What greeted me was a gust of warm air and the distant, constant whir of fans.

The hallway beyond was low-ceilinged, wider than it needed to be, with no signs, no paint. The walls were concrete and metal. The floors smooth, sealed tile. The lights above flickered every few seconds like they weren’t sure anyone was still supposed to be here.

The smell hit next—old paper, ozone, and something acrid and plasticky beneath it all, like burned silicon, the kind you smell near ancient servers or early-generation computers left running too long.

Somewhere far down the corridor, a fan groaned. Then another.

The air tasted processed.

Level E went on farther than I could see. Rows and rows of shelves—most of them still full—disappearing into a blue-gray haze under the flickering fluorescents.

Whatever this place was, it hadn’t been cleared out.
Hadn’t been repurposed.
Hadn’t even been sealed.

It had just been… left.

Waiting.

It took me nearly an hour to find the Vault Reference aisle.

Lower Annex 3 curved strangely—it wasn’t gridded like the upper floors. More like a coil, or a loop, with rows misnumbered and signs stenciled by hand. I found P-SHORE etched faintly on the edge of a metal beam above one of the shelving banks.

Row 44-P.

Empty.

The shelf was there. The tag, the slot—everything. But the box itself?

Gone.

No pulled file card. No requisition slip. Just a dust shadow where the container had once been, like someone had quietly removed it years ago.

I stood there for a long time, feeling the low static pulse of the fans, the too-warm air around me, the scent of brittle paper and forgotten electricity.

Then I turned and walked back up.

For weeks, I let it go.

Almost.

I buried myself in record pulls. Logged decommissioned folders. Lost myself in the calm hum of routine and bureaucracy.

A part of me started to write it off. Fabrication. Imagination. A story stitched together from stale caffeine and half-read memos. Something I wanted to mean more than it did.

But then—

Three Fridays later.

I came in early. 7:38 a.m. Lights off in most of the building. Just me and the hum of the badge reader.

My office is small. Half-glass wall, desk barely big enough for two file boxes. I set my thermos down, turned to boot up the system.

And froze.

A box was already sitting there.

Plain, archival gray. Lid on. Edges clean. But the label—

P-SHORE.04

My skin went cold.

I hadn’t filed a request. I hadn’t mentioned it since the day I’d gone down to Level E.

I reached out, heart thudding, and pulled the lid off.

Inside were photo negatives, curled gently with age, some still bound in paper sleeves labeled STF-Phase II, Airfield 5, Interior Mockup A.

I held one up to the light.

Flying saucers—but not flying. Just rigged on gantries, photographed from above, shadows painted on the ground. Another showed vast hangars, warehouse-scale, with dismantled alien figures, joints disconnected, fiberglass insides exposed like mannequins flayed open.

In the bottom corner of the box was a small envelope.

Typed label.

FROM: Allen
Thought I’d give you a hand.
Come see me when you’re done.

My breath caught.

Allen.

The archive manager.

I hadn’t spoken to him in months. He worked two floors up. Oversaw record rotations and special project requests. Quiet. Friendly, in a distant, career-fed way.

But now every worst-case scenario lit up in my head like a board.

Was he testing me? Watching me? Was this a trap?

Or was he the only one who knew what I’d seen?

I walked to his office with my pulse thudding in my neck. The hallway felt longer than usual. The carpet muted everything but the sound inside my skull.

Allen was already seated behind his desk, thumbing through a personnel ledger with the easy rhythm of a man who'd been doing the same job for forty years.

He looked up when I knocked.

“Ah,” he said, smiling like this was a casual meeting. “Come in. Close the door.”

I did.

“Have a seat.”

I sat.

He gestured toward the box still sitting in my arms. “You opened it?”

I nodded.

He nodded back, as if to say good.

“You’ve got questions. I figured you might.”

He leaned back, hands folded neatly. There were plaques on the wall behind him—decades of civil service. A faded Polaroid of an old records room. A smiling group of archivists, all gone now.

Allen spoke evenly, like he was explaining filing protocol to a trainee.

“For decades,” he said, “the United States government has maintained a narrative framework—call it a long-term psychological utility model—rooted in the cultural potency of extraterrestrial belief.”

He smiled faintly at my blank stare.

“I mean UFOs. Aliens. Visitors from beyond.”

He went on, calm as ever.

“After the War of the Worlds broadcast in ’38, a few folks in the intelligence community noticed something... interesting. The panic wasn’t the surprise. The relief afterward was. Something about the fear—about the possibility of not being alone—it did something. It made people feel connected. Hopeful, even.”

He tapped his temple lightly.

“People want to believe there’s something out there. Something bigger. Watching. Waiting. Maybe even intervening.”

Allen leaned forward, voice dropping just a note.

“And when the world begins to slip—economies collapse, wars grind on, people question the ground beneath their feet—well… it’s useful to let them look up instead.”

He smiled again, but this time it didn’t reach his eyes.

“Pallid Shore was just one thread in the tapestry. A controlled myth. A narrative ecosystem. Every so often we let something slip—an image, a memo, a memo that looks like it wasn’t meant to be read. Someone finds it. Whistleblower types. Idealists. They think they’ve uncovered truth.”

He paused.

“But really, we just gave them something to chase. Something to broadcast. And they do. Every time.”

I felt sick.

I swallowed. “So it's all a lie, all of it?”

Allen tilted his head. “Does it matter?”

He let the silence hang, let it settle in my lungs like smoke.

Then, calmly, he said, “Can you be trusted?”

I nodded.

That’s when it happened.

His eyes—still on mine—blinked sideways.

Not a twitch. Not a trick of light. A thin, wet membrane slid from both sides of each eye, meeting in the middle. Then retreated, silent as breath.

And from the side of his mouth, a forked tongue flicked out, tasting the air, glossy and black and wrong.

He didn’t flinch. Didn’t move. Just sat there like nothing had happened.

Then he smiled.

“The best way to hide something,” he said softly, “isn’t to bury a lie inside the truth.”

He leaned forward, voice barely above a whisper.

“It’s to bury the truth inside a lie. So deep, so familiar, that the moment anyone touches it... they hope it’s fiction.”

His smile faded.

“Now,” he said, “how about we talk about your future?”",1,1749487715.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

06/18 - Land 9am. Check into hotel in Nusa Dua. Explore the resort, pool, beach, Bali collection, waterblow etc.

06/19 - Bali zoo (9am - 2pm). Lunch then go to either Ulluwatu temple or GWK in the late afternoon depending on how the kids are doing. Alternatively just chill in the resort/beach

06/20 - Nusa penida custom day trip to the west side (we plan on a late start by catching the 9:30am fast boat and don’t plan on any snorkeling/diving, just enjoying the beautiful cliffs and beaches. 4pm return ferry to catch the kecak/barong dance show in nusa dua at 6pm

06/21 - We have lunch reservations at Koral. Flexible in the afternoon. Could do Ulluwatu/GWK on this day instead.

06/22 Move to Kintamani for 1 night and stop at Besakih temple and maybe a coffee plantation en route (recommendations welcome)

06/23 Parents will do the sunrise hike while the kids and I chill at the hotel. Check-out after breakfast and drive to Ubud, stopping at tegalalang on the way. Can do ubud palace & saraswati temple in the evening if not too tired.

06/24 Start the day with the ceremony at tirta empul then Monkey forest, ubud palace, saraswati temple, art market. We’re planning to skip all the waterfalls this time. 

06/25 return flight at 10:30am

I've never got lip filler before and I wanted a very very conservative amount, a little hydration and plumping but nothing anyone I know would really visibly notice. I told her I wanted to start with .5 but that I trusted her etc. She said great let me do .5 and you want more we can add more from the syringe. She starts filling then gives me the mirror and I'm immediately in shock because it looks HUGE. She then tells me she put in .7 because ""my lips could take it""...so she essentially put more in my lips without my consent. I am 6 days in from my treatment and truly doing my best to not freak out but really having a hard time. I know people say to wait 2 weeks for the swelling to go down but unless its going to go down a fair amount, it is more than I wanted. Especially my lower lip, it feels huge.

So all in all, how do I handle this situation - she said she would follow up at the two week mark. Am I overreacting and the lips will go down - how did you handle the waiting process. I feel incredibly self concious, my partner has noticed, his parents noticed, have to have a networking coffee tomorrow and feeling nervous she's going to notice. Send help.

1l79n0t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l79n0t,Review of Cheech’s,"Dearest constituents—I apologize for the delay in getting this review to you. Between my full-time job running a cute cafe in Brooklyn, to being a dog mom to a very needy senior pup, breakfast journalism has been temporarily moved to the back seat—and for that I apologize deeply. 

Now, let get to it. 

Cheech’s Bagels. In the bagel desert that Jersey City once was, you were our beacon of hope. A light that shined into the void of our hearts, awaiting to be filled by your doughy delight. I had such high hopes. But alas…

This review is based on 2 separate visits.

My first visit was really more of an ad hoc one, as I’d read on this thread some concerns from fellow Jersey Citians that the salt situation on the everything bagel was at or near code red/max salt level; I was in the neighborhood and saw that there was a very short line, so I stopped by for an everything bagel with plain cream cheese. 

Let me tell you something—the bagel was salty. Really salty.  Now, as was also mentioned in the post that initially mentioned saltgate, Cheech’s may very well have designed their bagels to be primarily used as a vehicle for a more robust sandwich, where the heightened salt level plays a utilitarian role in enhancing the other flavors of the sandwich. This is fair and I do respect the fine-tuning of a product for peak performance. However, if that’s the case, there needs to be another, “standard” version of each bagel for use with a simple spread, since Cheech’s do offer simple spreads, too (albeit not a wide variety). If you’re going to fine-tune a product to work over here, then you’ll need to also fine tune it to work over there. Or at very least, inform your customers of the salt bomb they’re about to stick in their mouths. 

On my second visit, they were out of plain bagels, which was shocking at 12:30pm on a Sunday but maybe that’s a bit late in the day, so I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt for that. I took a BEC on an egg bagel to go.

First, immediately upon unwrapping, I noticed the color and texture of the egg. It appeared to have a  grayish tint to it which I can’t say I’ve ever really seen before, which makes me think they’re either using some kind of prepackaged egg mix (which would be absolutely egregious and appalling) or they’re mixing the egg with milk or something similar. Also, the eggs are extremely dense, which makes me think they’re blending them first (or again, this would track with a premade egg mix). I can’t be certain about any of that, these are just my observations and notes. Now, the second thing that stood out to me was the placement of the bacon. As you can see from the below photo, bacon only appears on 1/3 to 1/2 of my sandwich. This is an amateur hour move and something taught in Breakfast Sandwich 101—breakfast meats and other ingredients should be uniformly distributed to ensure consistency from bite to bite throughout the lifespan of the sandwich. The cheese, which I was not asked to select and therefore do not know the kind, was there, but just barely. The ratio of cheese to egg was embarrassing, with only a paltry amount of cheese present. This, of course, meant that any hopes of a hot, gooey, cheesy breakfast sandwich would be shattered. 

The bagel itself was actually not bad, except for the fact that there was no hole (also pictured below—sorry for the bite, I didn’t realize until after I already took a bite that there was no hole!), which of course is the signature feature of a bagel. Flavor- and texture-wise, I have no complaints about the bagel, although it’s nothing to write home about.

All in all, I found Cheech’s to be an extreme letdown. I realize that my very high hopes are contributing to that letdown, but with all of the work that went into the space, branding, signage, etc., I think it’s natural to assume that the product, which is the star of the show after all, would be on par with everything else. Not to mention the huge opportunity there was (and apparently still it) to really knock it out of the park here in JC as far as bagels are concerned. 

I will definitely not be returning for bagels, although I would like to try their coffee. 

PS: At some point, I’ll be reviewing B Bagels as well; I’ve read over and over that B is now the supreme bagel in town. Stay tuned! 

Thanks for reading, everyone. Happy Breakfasting!! 🐣🥚🍳🥯🍞

1l79m62,https://i.redd.it/087but0rjx5f1.jpeg,My Decant Haul: First Impressions After a Wear Test,"I didn’t want to settle for just one fragrance, but at the same time, I didn’t want to get a bunch of clones just to scratch an itch—so I decided to get decants of the fragrances I wanted to try. Here are my thoughts after a wear test.

ARMAF CDN MALEKA - ""Queen of Armaf""
The only reason I wanted to try this was the litchi note, and wow, it's noticeable from the very first spray! When it settles, it's such a well-done powdery scent. Three hours into the wear, I could still get delightful sniffs of it, and by hour eight, I really had to sniff my clothes, but I genuinely loved the wear. It's such a sexy scent, and yes, it definitely leans feminine.

Overall Rating: 7.5 - Great opening, well-balanced scent.

Gisada Ambassador
I wrote a detailed review in my previous post.

Nishane Ani
Such a complicated fragrance, but in a good way, at least for me. It's your everyday comfort fragrance, a true statement setter that screams attention. It worked well on me, and I loved the opening—spicy, sweet, and woody. I adore vanilla, and the vanilla in this is so unique. Performance and sillage are good. This fragrance is definitely on my buy list!

A solid 8.

Mancera Cedrat Bois Intense
I liked the scent profile, but my judgment is biased after reading about the ""Beast mode"" tag this fragrance gets. For me, I want a fragrance that I can smell on myself for at least four hours. I don't know if I was nose-blind or what, but I couldn't get sniffs of it after an hour and had to reapply multiple times. Maybe that's why I completely overlooked the art that this scent is. Ahhh, the citrus, the leather—I just wanted to feel it a little longer.

A 6.5 - Had high expectations.

Aether French Avenue
I love the scent profile; it's such a fresh, literally green fragrance. When I smelled it, the color green popped up in my head. Green defines this fragrance both in scent profile and performance—it's like a fleeting breeze. How can an ""extrait"" perform like this? Maybe I have to macerate it for some time, but with such weak performance, I don't don't think there'll be a drastic improvement.

A 5.8

Lattafa Al Nashma Caprice
A mix of some of my favorite notes, featuring a really good cardamom note. It has a fresh, spicy opening that settles into a nice, woody dry down. Very easy to wear and versatile, it's a mature scent with decent performance. I got about six hours, and I'm happy with that.

7.5

Dumont Nitro Red
I wanted to get my hands on this for a long time, then my enthusiasm died down a bit when it became available. But I had to give it a chance, and wow, I loved it! It's aromatic and fruity, and I really like the woodsy note—it could easily be a daily wear. Then I kept thinking, ""It reminds me of something,"" but I couldn't figure out what. At first, I thought Khadlaj Island, but after going through all my fragrances, I found it: Hawas Ice! Good performance, but the scent profile is definitely geared towards the youth.

A 7.

Montale Sensual Instinct - 10ml wasn’t available on scentoria had to settle for 2 but man I loved it Yes, there’s definitely a touch of rose in Instinct, but it’s subtle—blended smoothly with the almost boozy sweet, gourmand notes. soft elegance under the bold coffee and amber, making the whole scent feel warm and luxurious without being too floral. And great performance 
A solid 8


Now, Talking About the H-Words...
Hawas Black
I liked the citrusy opening; they used a good bergamot that doesn't make it too acidic, thanks to the pineapple. It opens into a good woody, slightly floral dry down. If I had done my research before buying, I would've picked this one sooner. It's a really strong fragrance; I could feel it for seven hours! A good, versatile fragrance, my advice: don't spray on white clothes, and definitely don't overspray—it packs a punch!

7.5 - A solid fragrance.

Hawas Fire
I'm not usually a fan of mineral notes, but this one has a pleasant fruity sweetness. It's a fresh, clean, and playful fragrance with good performance. This one feels like a bright, energetic burst for a fun day out.

I made this subreddit to hold Sabrina Claudio accountable. She was caught as a bully & has now spent the last several years trying to say the reason of her hate was due to her being bullied & bored. 

Nigerian singer CKAY will be releasing an album on June 13th. His song ""AGAIN"" will be featuring Sabrina Claudio. Sabrina first single ""TELL ME"" released on April 1st, 2016. This post was made on March 6th, 2014. 757 days which is 2 years. Many of Sabrina's interviews states that for 2 years she was miserable because she was unable to make music, but once she left Florida for California she started a whole new life for herself. Her new life that included forgetting her shitty behavior & beliefs from Florida. 

IM CONVINCED HER TEAM HATES HER, BECAUSE HOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS HAS NO ONE REMOVED IT?! HOW DISGUSTING THAT SABRINA CLAUDIO STILL HAS THIS POST UP ON HER FACEBOOK. SHE MADE TWO APOLOGY POSTS REGARDING HER RACIST PAST, BUT SHE DID NOT LEAVE THEM UP... WHY? There are articles online of the apologies, but no apologies are on any of her socials... why?

TANERELLE, how dare you make a song with her knowing this post is still up. Do you know that you are Sabrina's token black girl? Her posts were made almost 10 years ago, so of course in todays time that's why you forgave her, because it happened ""soooooo long ago"". When shit hit the fan in 2017/2018, many of us were hurt because it wasnt ""THAT LONG AGO"". 

CKAY, Lupita may have Mexican nationality but her ethnic background is African. CKAY your fiancée has dark skin, how dare you enlist Sabrina when there are millions of other singers you could find that don't hate black women. You could've picked a dark skinned Latina woman who doesn't have a history of sharing her hate for darker skin. 

Everyone do your best to make sure Sabrina does not continue to infiltrate the dark skinned community because we DID NOT FORGET. BlackCoffee did a song with her years ago, & yet he should've been the only African to make that mistake. CKAY DO BETTER.",1,1749487131.0,SeriouslyCancelled,1,1.0,False

I'm trying to make a hazelnut espresso layer cake for a friend's celebration. I plan on making an espresso sponge with a hazelnut praline paste filling, hazelnut soak and an espresso icing.
 The original recipe I'm basing my idea off of is just espresso sponge with an espresso icing and uses a traditional American buttercream. I want to mix the praline paste into the frosting and since I'm adding more sweetness, I'm thinking a Swiss meringue buttercream will be better since it tends to be less sweet but I'm worried it'll be too dense for a filling. 

I'm also wondering if the mini chocolate chips in the cake from the original recipe will add depth of flavor or take away from the coffee/hazelnut flavor and if I should omit them? And if I should crumble some of the hazelnut praline chunks between the cake layers to add texture or if it will be too crunchy/stick in your teeth?

Not on that street, not in that dress, not in that life. I’d left the brownstone just before six, ducking out the side door with nothing but a clutch full of cigarettes and a head full of static.

They were expecting me at the Ritz. My fiancé’s parents were hosting a New Year’s Eve gala with white-gloved staff and string quartets, and my job was to smile like I meant it, nod when spoken to, and wear the family sapphire like it wasn’t weighing down my throat.

But that night I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t be their daughter-in-law, or a Cabot’s wife, or the ornamental proof of old Boston wealth replicating itself.

So I left.

I didn’t have a plan, just instinct. Just a sense that I had to move, or I might calcify in that chandeliered birdcage forever. The teal silk clung to me in the damp air. I hadn’t eaten. My curls had started to unravel by Copley, and by the time I wandered past the Common, my heels were soaked through and my lipstick had vanished.

I walked like I was running away, but softly. Slowly. I passed families on their way to parties, kids in plastic tiaras, couples already half-drunk. I felt invisible and a little free. And when the sky gave way above Hanover Street, and the drizzle turned to sheets of rain, I didn’t run. 

I let it take me.

The streets cleared. People disappeared under awnings, inside cabs, into lives that fit. I stood under the overhang of the Old State House, mascara painting black streaks down my cheeks, satin clinging to my knees, and for the first time in years, I felt real.

That’s when I saw you.

You moved like someone who didn’t care about getting wet. Your jacket hung open, shoes soaked, face gaunt in a way that spoke of cigarettes and memory. You looked like the kind of man who had once been called home by someone and had never quite made it back.

And yet… your eyes were gentle. Steady. Like you’d been through hell but hadn’t let it hollow you out completely.

You looked at me like I was a person, not a spectacle.

You asked if I was alright. I told you I’d been better. You asked if I wanted coffee. I said only if you came with me. You offered your hand. I took it.

I didn’t ask your name.

We ran through the streets, laughing like strangers who knew something everyone else had forgotten. Into Neisner’s an old five-and-dime that smelled like grease and heat and something lost to time. We slid into red vinyl stools at the counter and ordered pie and terrible coffee that tasted like comfort anyway.

We talked like people who didn’t expect to be understood but were willing to try, just once. You told me about walking all day, about feeling unmoored, though you didn’t say why. I didn’t need you to. I could tell something had broken inside you, but not beyond repair.

I told you I was engaged to a man whose cufflinks cost more than my car, and who only kissed me when his mother was watching. You didn’t flinch. You didn’t give me a speech about self-respect. You just listened, nodding like someone who’d also chosen silence before.

We didn’t touch much. Just our elbows brushing on the counter. Just the shared heat of breath when we leaned in to laugh.  

I felt more seen in that hour than I had in the last 22 years of my life.

When you excused yourself to the bathroom, I stared at the check sitting on the counter and panicked.

I wanted to stay. I wanted to wait. But something in me short-circuited. A voice… my mother’s, maybe, or perhaps just my own voice twisted by years of second-guessing, said: 

this is too fragile, too good, too much. It won’t last. Don’t believe in it.

So I left.

I walked out into the night like a ghost.  I slipped through the door and disappeared into the fog. I didn’t even look back.

I cried the whole way to Kenmore. I caught a cab home. I climbed the fire escape, and sat on the roof for an hour in silence, drenched and shivering, but too ashamed to go back inside. 

I didn’t go to the party. 

I didn’t marry the banker.

And I never went back to Neisner’s.

But every time it rained, I thought about you. I wondered if you came back to the counter. I imagined you sitting there alone, checking the door. I hated myself for disappearing. I hated that I let fear win.

The years blurred.

I moved to New York, then back again. I painted for a while. I taught poetry to teenagers who thought no one was listening. I married someone else. He was kind, gentle, just damaged enough to recognize the same in me. We built something imperfect, but warm. He died in 1999.

I have a daughter. She’s wild and smart, and wears eyeliner like armor. I never told her about you directly, but sometimes she walks into a storm without an umbrella and I think… there you are again.

And now I’m older. The kind of older where people stop calling you beautiful, and start calling you “resilient.”

And still, some days, the sky turns iron, the clouds open, and I am 22 again, running through the wet streets of Boston in silk and sorrow, with your hand in mine.

I never learned your name. But I never forgot your face. And I never stopped believing that for one night, in a city full of ghosts, we saved each other.

So wherever you are, whether you remember me or not… know that I remember you.

You were the moment I learned that not all storms come to destroy you.

I just feel a little bit of tightness, but that’s just because I haven’t really done any stretching or anything like that but the way that I cured it was it was a weird series of events where I actually was bartending and I had this horrible pain in my chest and I figured out it was costochondritis And then I also had a little bit of mid back tightness, but then I ended up going to the chiropractor and she did an adjustment on me wrong and she actually twisted my spine out of whack so I had to go back to bartending and I was a horrible back pain mid back pain and then I randomly got fired the next week so this whole year basically from February till now has been the biggest shit show of my life but that being said since I got fired, I had to just go home and I couldn’t sleep laying down or on my side because my mid back would hurt so bad and I didn’t wanna sleep on my side cause I didn’t wanna flare my costochondritis so I actually bought a wedge pillow From Amazon and if you guys are interested, I can link you the one that I got and just sleeping on my back on the wedge pillow took all the pressure off my mid back spine, where the chiropractor messed it up and my Costco pains so I’ve been sleeping on that wedge pillow since late February And I’ve been taking it very easy. I haven’t gone to the gym. I haven’t done any lifting twisting anything like that and I’ve just been walking so if you guys can somehow someway not work your body so hard like if you have a demanding job somehow take the easier roles or if you have a desk job that’s perfect if you have a job or you’re not doing much that’s perfect. You just need your time you need time to rest. I don’t care what anybody says that you need to keep poking and prodding it stretching and using the fucking back pod you don’t need to do any of that. You need to rest and if that takes six months of sleeping on a wedge pillow, it takes six months sleeping on a wedge pillow lower your stress I cut out coffee completely because I was so stressed out. I used to drink two French presses of coffee pretty much a day for 20 years. I quit that now. I’m just drinking one cup of mudwtr a day. So there is hope I was spiraling before all this happened and it’s almost like it was meant to happen because I don’t have that horrible pain anymore in my chest where I would twist a certain way or push my hands together and it felt like a lightning bolt going through my whole body so that being said just rest I mean if it takes a year of sleeping on a wedge pillow, who cares if it’s gonna cure you forever now what I’m doing is I just need to try to slowly get back into the gym which I’m scared to do. I’m scared to flare this up so I’ll let you guys know how that goes once I cure this completely and I’m able to go back to the gym, but yeah if anybody’s mentally struggling with this and you feel like your life‘s over even if you’ve had this for years it’s because you’ve never let it settle and you’ve never taken six months of just wedge pillow put on YouTube watch some dumb shit And just suck it up for a while and then when you’re working, try to take the easiest route possible don’t do anything to flare it back up cut out all caffeine cut out alcohol.

Bio

Olivia is a 1-year-8-month-old pup who may seem shy at first, but our volunteers have observed that she warms up beautifully with a little patience. From what we've seen, Olivia often enjoys running and rolling to encourage play with other dogs, showing a seek and target play style. While initially reserved, this love-bug has been known to solicit belly rubs once she feels comfortable. Come meet Olivia today!

No gift socks, no forced smiles, just engines, eggs, and an excuse to leave the house early.

Even the sides are the main event, truffle chips, chorizo dripping in honey. Dessert? Don’t be daft, of course you’re getting one.

The Hairy Helmet Relay returns with teams of four charging round Darley Park in fancy dress like it’s sports day for grown-ups. Each leg’s just over two miles, so you don’t need to be Mo Farah to take part — just grab some mates, pull on something ridiculous, and leg it. It’s part race, part social, and a decent excuse to skip the gym. Friday 13th’s never looked so daft.

My friend and I are setting up a small mobile café (coffee, toasties, smoothies, etc.) and we really want to avoid using a petrol generator. Is it actually possible to run everything (sandwich press, fridge, grinder, blender, lights, maybe even an espresso machine) on just an EcoFlow setup — like the DELTA Pro 3 with an extra battery?

We’d be running about 6–8 hours a day, and don’t want to run out of power mid-shift. Has anyone here done something similar or can share what worked for them?

1l79aar,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeptQ/comments/1l79aar/series_vs_book_1_the_keeper_of_lost_causes/,Series vs Book 1 (The Keeper of Lost Causes),"I'm an avid reader of Nordic Noir and the Q Dept book series is one of my favorites. I've read the first 3 books and was excited to see this English adaptation on Netflix.

Overall the general feel and relationships are similar but there are some key differences in this TV series from Book 1:

* Location - obviously.  (Denmark vs Scotland)
* Merrit - >!Parts of Merrit's backstory is similar in both the book and TV series - she has a brother with brain damage. In both, she's devoted to her work and doesn't have much of a romantic life. But a lot of her backstory has been changed. In the book, she's an influential staffer with a political party, not a lawyer.  In the book, the beating when she was younger didn't happen. Instead there was a car accident when she was younger that impacted the people who would become her kidnappers. If I remember correctly, her parents passed away and that car accident is what caused her brother's brain damage. !<
* Akram/Assad - >!In the book, Akram's character is called Assad. Like the TV series, he is a refugee from Syria, eager to work and has a mysterious background. However, in the book, his personality was a bit more cheerful and friendly. In fact he befriends very easily the colleagues in the police dept that despise Carl. Akram in the TV series is also eager to work and has a mysterious background. But he comes across as more flat in personality.!<
* Rose - >!Rose plays a small role in book 1 with helping with the case. In the TV series she plays a much more prominent role.!<
* Jasper - >!The whole threat to Jasper in the coffee shop never happens in the book. He's not as present a character in Book 1. !<
* Shooting of Hardy and policeman ->! This happens in the book but the culprits were different.!<
* Office for Dept Q ->! In the book Carl is given essentially a closet office on a floor with some admin staff. It wasn't this massive basement with toilets although I like all the toilet references in the TV series!!<

Curious to see if this gets renewed for another season. Book 2 is kinda out there for the cold case! Curious to see how they will depict it!",13,1749486465.0,DeptQ,0,0.94,False

I’m calm, loyal, and laid-back with a dry sense of humour and a quiet confidence — not one for centre stage, but I hold my own. I’m not a huge talker, but I don’t mind someone who is — I’m a good listener and I appreciate someone who can bring the conversation to life.

I love good company, upbeat music, late-night TV, walks by the sea, and cooking something half-decent for someone who appreciates it. I’m just as happy entertaining at home as I am heading out for a chilled drink or a bite to eat — pubs, restaurants, nothing too flashy. I’m not one for big crowds, but give me the right person and a relaxed setting, and I’m in my element.

I’ve got a thoughtful side, and I value honesty, emotional connection, and a spark that feels real. I’ve got a soft spot for women who know what they want and carry themselves with quiet strength — there’s something magnetic in that. I’m open to letting a dynamic unfold naturally, with room for playful tension, mutual trust, and a bit of give and take (or give and surrender, depending on the mood).

These days I’m keen to say yes to more — weekend breaks, new experiences, maybe even finally ticking off a few bucket list ideas and travelling a bit more. It’s something I haven’t done enough of, and it feels like time.

Ideal first meet? A decent coffee, a relaxed drink, maybe a walk if the weather’s playing nice — something low-key, no pressure, just two people seeing if there’s something worth exploring.

I click best with someone grounded and independent — someone who’s built their life and is open to sharing it. I’m a non-smoker.

If you’re emotionally switched on, like things real not forced, enjoy a bit of cheeky humour, and don’t mind carrying the conversation now and then… we might just get along.",0,1749486397.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

1l797mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngandtherestless/comments/1l797mx/yr_catch_up_rant_if_you_dont_mind/,Y&R catch up rant: (if you don't mind),"First off: 

*  Kyle and Claire are 30 years old why does it matter if Victor approves of them or not? Who cares what her 80 year old grandfather thinks? They're not highschoolers. 

* Assuming Billy Flynn is Aristotle Dumas, Josh Griffith has already ruined his new role before we've even seen him on our screens. I'm gonna assume it wasn't cheap to get Billy Flynn, why couldn't he just be a recast Scotty? Hell I'd have accepted him as Noah, it would've set him back older but I could've gone with that. 

* You've got a very talented soap vet on your show, who can act (Billy Flynn) has an Emmy Nomination and he's already being set up for failure.

* Who the hell cares about the new couch in the Abbott mansion?

* Does Adam have a life or personality or anything outside of Chelsea? This may be the worst Adam's been written: No life, no personality just all Chelsea. And on top of all that Mark and Melissa still don't have chemistry after all this time. 

* Josh brought the beautiful, talented, Emmy winning Mishael Morgan back for a pop in and it was Phyllis putting her feet up at the coffee table and more Aristotle Dumas stuff.

* What is Nikki's (and the rest of this shows) wardrobe.

* Why is this show allowed to be so boring? What is Steve Kent doing, we've got 3.5 years left of their renewal and I wanna know why bother renewing it if there was no attempts to improve the show?

* I'm tired of Adam vs Billy, that hasn't been interesting since Michael Muhney and Billy Miller and I'm even more tired of Jack vs Victor. Noah vs Kyle could with dedicated writing could've been a new Abbott/Newman feud at least it would be fresh.

* I never want another Newman dating an Abbott if I have to hear Victor bitch about it 

* Why did they completely declaw Claire? She was so promising in the beginning now she's boring too.

Thank you for your time and if anyone else needs or wants to rant about Y&R go for it. ",12,1749486300.0,youngandtherestless,8,0.93,False

I know I fucked up, thats a non starter. 10 Years of hearing about it, getting run down about it, and keep getting basic hell for it. I just need to know if I was the Asshole About it.
 
10 Years ago in the middle of the night, I got woken up by rusting sounds, saw the mouse and decided to hunt and capture the mouse as my dogs seemed totaly indifferent at our new house guest. Had it cornered and grabbed the first thing I could find a Tim Hortons Coffee Cup ( Canada), got the mouse, used a playing card to cover the hole and put enough water in the cup to drown the little fucker ( Ya, Im an asshole for that to you mouse lovers out there). Put the cover back on the coffee cup and satisfied with my mighty hunter skills went back to sleep.  Fuck, now my wife loves Timmies, second to her smokes nothing comes close. I guess she got up in the morning and thought it was a left over coffee or one that I purchased for her, picks up the cup goes to take a drink to have the cover fall off and some marathon water treading mother fucking super mouse jump into her face ( how the fuck he swam that long I have no clue).  Needless to say that week was utter hell for me, the next 10 years that week has been dealt back over and over again. I know I was Stupid, I know I fucked up but it wasnt intentional, I thought I did a good thing by catching that quick dirty little fuck. So I dont think I was actually an Asshole, My wife, her friends, and my kids seem to disagree with me. I just cant take it anymore, 10 years and still getting greased for it. She still drinks that bloody mud still anyway.
Lay it on, please if deserved, but am hoping maybe this can prove maybe I was just dumb and not an asshole. And yes I know Karma is a Bitch but if I just had of let him go outside he might have gotten back in. Fuck Fuck Fuck",1,1749486269.0,AITAH,9,0.6,False

1l792jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l792jk/angry_birdslevel_0/,ANGRY BIRDS-LEVEL 0,"Sometimes, I like to play games from my childhood for nostalgia. Recently (more precisely, at the end of 2024), I came across an ""Angry Birds"" file from around 2015–2016. Unfortunately, I don’t remember exactly where I found it—it might have been some Reddit forum or something similar. But back to the story.  

After downloading the file, I scanned it for viruses. The antivirus showed that the file was completely safe, so without hesitation, I immediately launched the game.  

When it started, I began playing. I watched the intro cutscene—where the pigs steal the birds' eggs—with warmth in my heart, enjoyed the menu music… in short, I had a solid five-out-of-five experience… until one moment.  

When I finished the game from start to end, I noticed something strange: on the level selection screen, before the first level, another one had appeared. It didn’t have a stylized icon like the others—just a black rectangle with a ""0"" at the top. At first, I found it odd, but I didn’t think much of it and decided to try the new level.  

Upon launching it, the screen turned black, the UI disappeared, and distorted music started playing in the background—as if it was being played backward. Slowly, Red’s face emerged from the darkness… but he looked… “different”.  

He was pale, his eyes unnaturally wide open, his pupils shrunken to pinpricks, with burst capillaries at the edges, as if he hadn’t blinked for days. His beak was stretched into a broad, lifeless grin. It made me deeply uneasy.  

I tried to exit to the menu, but the ""Esc"" key didn’t work. After 10 seconds, text appeared above Red:  

""SPREAD""  

The music stopped. Then, after 3–5 seconds, it suddenly resumed—sped up, deafening, literally pounding against my eardrums. In panic, I threw my headphones onto the desk and looked back at the screen to see Red distorted even further: his grin had stretched impossibly wide, and he twitched as if in a seizure. The text changed to:  

""SPREAD IT EVERYWHERE"" 

Soon after, the game crashed. I just sat there in front of the monitor for about three minutes, stunned, thinking: \*WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?!\* Then I went to make myself some coffee.  

The next day, I sat back at my computer, hesitating—should I launch the game or not? I wanted to replay all the levels, but I couldn’t get THAT out of my head. Eventually, I gathered my courage and opened ""Angry Birds"" again. The familiar Rovio Studios logo appeared, I went to the menu, clicked ""Play,"" and…  
The zero level was gone.  

I sighed in relief, selected the first level, and started playing.  

So, that’s the story. Why am I telling you this? Because two days ago, while cleaning junk files from my PC, I found a folder full of text documents—each containing just one line:  

""SPREAD IT EVERYWHERE""  

And then I remembered that incident with Red.  

Now, my question to you: ""Have you ever encountered the zero level in Angry Birds?""",1,1749485963.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1l791ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1l791ph/does_tide_free_gentle_detergent_pacs_deliver_on/,Does Tide Free & Gentle Detergent Pacs Deliver on Skin-Friendly Deep Clean Review?,"Testing the Tide 30772094884 PODS Free & Gentle Liquid Laundry Detergent Pacs, I found this product to be incredibly functional while also catering to sensitive skin needs. As someone prone to skin irritations, I’m always cautious when choosing cleaning products. These laundry detergent pods claim to be hypoallergenic and free of dyes or perfumes—a combination that instantly grabbed my attention. They come in a compact pack of 76 pods, which is perfect for tackling multiple loads without the cumbersome jug of liquid detergent.

**Key Benefits**  
The gentle yet effective cleaning power of these pods deserves recognition. I used them on heavily soiled items, including kid's muddy soccer jerseys and kitchen towels, and they worked impressively well. Each pac combines concentrated detergent, stain removers, and color protectors, giving the perfect ""three-in-one"" effect. Moreover, I appreciated the convenience of simply tossing one pod into the washing machine; there’s no measuring or spillage to deal with. Here’s why this product stands out:  
- **Gentle on sensitive skin**: Hypoallergenic and free of irritating residues, dyes, or perfumes.  
- **Highly effective stain removal**: Even tough stains like coffee or grass didn’t stand a chance.  
- **Versatility**: Performs equally well in both hot and cold water, and works with any type of washing machine.

**Usability and Design**  
The compact design of the pods themselves matters a lot. They’re small and easy to store, keeping the detergent area neat and tidy in a way that liquid containers never do. I particularly liked the safe packaging, which kept my curious four-year-old from accessing it (though I’d always recommend child-safety locks just to be sure). The simplicity of the design meant I didn’t have to wrestle with a complicated system: toss one in and move on, no fuss.  

**Performance in Everyday Use**  
Throughout two kids’ soccer seasons, these pods came through for me. They stood up to everything from chocolate milk spills to dirt-covered socks. What really struck me was their ability to deliver exceptional cleaning even in cold water. I did back-to-back loads without noticing any drop in quality. Even with the lack of overpowering fragrances, laundry came out crisp and fresh every time. My only gripe is that on a couple of occasions, the pod didn't dissolve properly in cooler settings, leaving some residue on the clothes.  

**Favorable Attributes**  
A few highlights I noticed while using these pods consistently:  
- NEA and NPF certifications give additional peace of mind for allergy concerns.  
- Works on various washable fabrics, making it applicable for the diverse items in my household.  
- Convenient for those with high-efficiency machines or older models as they adapt remarkably.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
But hey, nothing’s perfect, right? A couple of drawbacks caught my eye as I tested them extensively:  
- Despite their overall efficacy, they’re not the most budget-friendly option compared to bulk liquid detergent.  
- Occasionally, residue appeared when washing items in cooler cycles, which was annoying to rinse out.  
- The lack of a clear scent might disappoint users who prefer laundry to have a distinct fragrance.

**Competing Products**  
Having tried other brands like Gain Flings and Persil ProClean Discs, I noticed some clear differences. Gain Flings bring vibrant scents, which is appealing but might irritate sensitive skin. Meanwhile, Persil ProClean excels at deep stain removal but doesn’t offer the same hypoallergenic assurance I found here. Tide's pods marry efficiency with sensitivity, filling a gap that many products overlook. However, price sensitivity might drive some families toward alternatives available at a lower cost.  

**Quality for Price**  
This pack of 76 pods comes at a relatively premium rate, though the cleaning power and hypoallergenic properties arguably justify the investment. I predict families with sensitive skin, like mine, would find this a worthy trade-off. When compared to cheaper liquid detergents, it’s clear you’re paying for advanced engineering—the combination of stain-removing agents, detergent, and fabric care in one tiny pod. The convenience also adds considerable value for busy households.

The imperfect peace that comes from soft warm lights and the possibility of what’s to come. It was a Saturday night and she decided to have a do nothing day. One meal consisting of chicken and under seasoned vegetables. Followed up with an espresso martini. 

The white ceiling with a uniform stamped design which would require hours of manual labor to remove. The buttery tan walls of the living room highlighted the copious holes left by the previous owner’s art obsession. The humble vaulted ceiling that made the room feel roomy but not chapel-like. Honey blonde wood flooring that resulted in a wobbly coffee table on one side of the room and a sturdy surface on the other end. The curved window that looked over the front yard and dead end street and made her feel close to nature. A white and black fireplace felt out of place and she hoped to DIY a solution down the road. 

Diagonal across from the living room was the dining room. Area really. The same ceiling design in the living room carried throughout the house. Th walls were a bluish gray with a skinny white crown molding and doubly wide chair rail. There was only one full wall as the second wall was interrupted by a double French door leading to the deck. 

She loved her dining table, a long rectangle with variably colored medium tone wood top and a white base with legs that narrow as they approach the floor. The dining chairs weren’t really dining chairs. Eight beige metal chairs surrounded the base and acted as placeholder for chairs within her realm of reality to acquire. Her goal was to learn some woodworking because the table required some repair. A long split had shown up down the middle of the table which did not make the table unsuitable for use but worried her all the time.

The kitchen was not the large but was more than enough room for one person to cook a meal for two. The bluish gray wall color carried from the dining room into the kitchen and was interrupted by a black, gray, and whites stone backsplash. Santa Cecilia granite countertops with with variety of colors allowing her to pick any colors that might fit her palette. 20 year old black appliances were holding on by finger. One more year and then she could afford a more modern stainless steel; though the black wasn’t too bad. Two corner windows behind the sink over looked a corner of the backyard painted by mature trees and creeping ivy. ",1,1749485903.0,writingcritiques,2,1.0,False
