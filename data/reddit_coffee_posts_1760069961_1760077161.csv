I‚Äôm currently using medium roast beans that are 9 days from the roast date. My inner burr grinder setting was about 3. My dosage amount dial was set all the way to the max. I measured out 18g of beans, used my WDT to break up clumps, distributor spinning tool set to the lowest height which I believe is just above 5mm. I tamped using the force of my weight from my chest while my arm bent at a 90¬∞ angle (yes that matters for an even tamp). No puck screen was used.

I initially started my grind dial setting at 7. With 18g of ground beans, I yielded 46g of coffee in 19 seconds (Underextracted).

I did the whole procedure again, but decreased my grind dial setting to 6. 18g of ground beans, I yielded 38g of coffee in 24 seconds (close enough to 36g in 25-30sec range. I‚Äôm happy with the result).

Long story short: Too fine of a grind can still cause channeling because of excess pressure from the group head and the tamped puck can create channeling even with even tamping. By grinding coarser, the built-up pressure between the group head and the tamped puck will not be excessive to create channeling. YMMV",1,1760076452.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

This budget perfume got me compliments from different people in a single day 

It all started right in my neighborhood. I was just going to my office when one of my neighbors called out to me from behind and said

 ‚ÄúYaar tera perfume bahut achha hai, maza aa gaya isko sniff karke.. ekdam classy si vibe de raha hai.‚Äù



I smiled, said thank you, then mai office chla gya

Then at my office, one of my female colleagues said,

‚ÄúYaar you smell so good... aaj wala perfume ekdam hi alag hai.‚Äù


Later, when I was hanging out with my friends, even they noticed and complimented me. I was honestly so happy  it literally made my day.

And to top it off, while returning home in the metro, a random uncle sitting nearby leaned towards me and said,

‚ÄúKitna achha perfume hai bhai kaunsa hai?‚Äù


I told him the name, and he was genuinely impressed and said ki mai bhi purchase krunga

I had used around 5‚Äì7 sprays, and it lasted the entire day easily. To be honest, the fragrance is just beautiful a creamy, vanilla-coffee vibe with smooth warmth that feels luxurious.

1o2t0si,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenmarkExplained/comments/1o2t0si/why_so_many_people_get_copenhagen_wrong/,Why So Many People Get Copenhagen Wrong,"Copenhagen is often reduced to quick images of colorful harbor houses, bicycles on every street, and expensive coffee. While those impressions are partly true, they leave out much of what makes the city genuinely unique.

The city consistently ranks among the world‚Äôs most livable capitals, not only because of its design and cycling culture, but also because of deep-rooted social structures that many outsiders overlook. For example:

* Public transport is integrated across trains, buses, and metro in a way that minimizes car dependency.
* Urban planning has focused on green spaces for decades, leading to access to nature within minutes from the city center.
* The welfare system ensures healthcare and education are accessible, but newcomers are often surprised to discover areas that aren‚Äôt fully covered.
* Innovation and sustainability are more than buzzwords; Copenhagen aims to become the world‚Äôs first carbon-neutral capital by 2030.

The common myth is that Copenhagen is only about ‚Äúhygge‚Äù or postcard views. The reality is more complex, involving centuries of planning, cultural values around trust, and a society that balances freedom with responsibility.

For those considering a visit or even a move, understanding these layers makes the experience far richer than the stereotypes suggest.

my husband left me right after i had our baby and i still dont really understand how any of it happened

im 35f hes 37 and a surgeon we were together around 10 years married for 7 i helped him all thru med school and residency i worked full time covered rent bills groceries even his car insurance when he couldnt he always said he‚Äôd pay it all back someday and i believed him

when he finally got his big job i thought we made it you know that all those hard years would be worth it but he changed like instantly he got quiet and distant like he was living somewhere else in his head he stopped laughing at anything i said he‚Äôd come home from the hospital and just stare at the wall or read medical journals at the table i‚Äôd touch his shoulder and he‚Äôd flinch like he didn‚Äôt want to be touched

sometimes when i tried to hug him he‚Äôd just go stiff and say he was tired it got to the point i stopped trying i‚Äôd just sit next to him hoping he‚Äôd say something but he never did

when i got pregnant i thought maybe it would pull us back together it didn‚Äôt he got even colder he said he was stressed about finances and scheduling and that i didn‚Äôt understand the pressure he was under i thought maybe he was just scared of becoming a dad

he missed the birth said there was an emergency in the OR he showed up next morning with a gas station coffee and flowers still wrapped in plastic i didn‚Äôt even cry then i just felt numb

then three weeks later i got an email from a lawyer divorce papers just dropped out of nowhere he had already moved out the reason was ‚Äúmarital misconduct‚Äù i swear i never cheated never even came close i begged him to talk he said it was better this way and that was the last normal conversation we ever had

he handled the finances always so i didn‚Äôt realize until court what he‚Äôd done he sold the house and one car and used all that money to pay off his med school loans over a million dollars gone then he filed so by the time we divided assets there was basically nothing left his lawyer said it was legitimate debt management and somehow the judge agreed

i had about 130k saved mostly from side projects and bonuses i hid a little each month just trying to be careful i thought it was our safety net for the baby turns out i had to give him part of it because of something called ‚Äúequalization‚Äù basically i ended up paying him to leave me

my lawyer was useless honestly i feel scammed twice he kept saying ‚Äútheres not much we can do the paperwork looks clean‚Äù and told me to settle before it dragged out i asked how this was legal and he just shrugged and said it happens sometimes

now im in a tiny one bedroom with a newborn the sink leaks and i cant afford a plumber i eat cereal out of paper bowls cause i still havent unpacked the real dishes half my stuff is in boxes i cry all the time i try to keep it together when im feeding the baby but she feels it i know she does she looks at me with these wide eyes and i just break

i keep replaying everything wondering if there was a moment he decided i wasn‚Äôt worth it anymore maybe he planned this for months maybe years maybe he was already gone long before he left i don‚Äôt even care about the money now i just want to know if what he did was even legal can someone really sell everything pay off their own debt and then file for divorce so the other person gets nothing

my lawyer says appealing won‚Äôt help and would cost too much but i can‚Äôt stop thinking this can‚Äôt be right there has to be something i can do or at least someone who can explain how this was allowed i just feel so stupid and tired and empty",1,1760075966.0,legaladvice,2,0.67,False

""Bathroom,"" I said flatly.

Cruz's dad cleared his throat. ""Well, we can take another one,"" he offered, trying to smooth the tension. ""One with everyone in it this time.""

But the moment had already soured. No one moved.

And Sadie? She just smiled, like she'd won something.

Ember's POV

Moving to South Louisiana felt like standing at the edge of a diving board, heart pounding, unsure if the water below would be warm or ice-cold. The air was thick with the scent of cypress and something unfamiliar-maybe excitement, maybe fear, maybe both. Cruz and I had just hauled the last of the boxes into our small rental house nestled near the bayou. The cicadas were already singing their lazy tune as if announcing the start of a new season, a new life.

We were finally here. After years in Dallas-me teaching kindergarten and Cruz working long hours under big-name architects-we were taking the leap. He was stepping into his dad's shoes, running the family construction business, and I'd landed a job at the local elementary school.

Everything about this move felt fragile and monumental all at once. The town. The house. The people. But the biggest leap of all was Cruz. Trusting in the man I'd loved so fiercely since college. He was the golden retriever to my sunshower-warm, loyal, endlessly optimistic. He'd proposed a year ago in the park where we had our first picnic, kneeling in the grass with that crooked smile and too much hope in his eyes. I said yes without a blink. I meant it.

And yet, as I stood in our new kitchen surrounded by half-unpacked boxes, chipped counters, and the quiet hum of crickets outside, a sharp ache clawed at my chest.

""I still can't believe we're really here,"" Cruz said, stepping up behind me and wrapping his arms around my waist. His familiar warmth enveloped me, and his peck to the top of my head was feather-light, reverent.

""I know,"" I murmured, trying to steady my breath. ""It feels... big.""

He turned me in his arms, concern in those honey-brown eyes. ""You okay?""

I hesitated, then nodded. ""I think so."" My voice trembled, betraying me. ""It's just... a lot. New place. New job. New people. It's exciting, but also kinda terrifying.""

His brow furrowed. ""We don't have to do this if you're not ready.""

I shook my head quickly, almost desperately. ""No, Cruz. I want this. I want us. I just..."" My throat thickened as I looked around the kitchen, the shadows long from the late afternoon sun. ""I've always been the girl who had her roots. And now I've pulled them up and replanted them somewhere completely different.""

He gently tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. ""You're not alone,"" he said, his voice low and grounding. ""We're doing this together. And if at any point it gets too much, we figure it out-together.""

Tears burned behind my eyes, and I blinked fast, not wanting them to fall. Cruz always knew how to anchor me-how to make the storm inside me feel less like a threat and more like a passing summer rain.

That's what always drew me to him. He didn't just love with words-he loved with actions. With the way he made my coffee just right. The way he always double-knotted my sneakers before a walk. The way he looked at me like I was the only thing that ever made sense.

Still, that night, lying in bed beside him in our unfamiliar room, with the scent of paint still clinging to the walls and distant frogs croaking near the water, I couldn't help the quiet thrum of unease beneath my ribs. I stared at the ceiling fan spinning slowly above, each turn whispering questions I didn't yet have answers for.

Would this town love me like Cruz did? Would his childhood friends accept me? Would I always feel this out of place?

I turned on my side and looked at Cruz, already asleep, his chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm. My fingers grazed his cheek, tracing the soft stubble there.

""I'm all in,"" I whispered into the dark, even if a small, scared part of me wasn't sure what that promise would cost.



Cruz's POV

I woke to the smell of morning fog and Ember beside me, still tangled in dreams. There was something about this house-even with its creaky floors and crooked cabinets-that already felt like ours. This was it. This was where everything changed.

I used to think moving back home would feel like slipping into a favorite pair of boots-broken in, familiar, comforting. But now? It felt like those boots had been waiting for me all along. Like they'd missed me, the way I'd missed this place.

I padded into the kitchen and ran my hand along the counter I planned to refinish. My dad always said homes are built twice-once with plans, once with memories. I couldn't wait to fill this house with ours. Ember's laughter, holiday mornings, late-night dance sessions in the kitchen, future kids scribbling on the fridge. All of it.

I heard her stir as I poured coffee into her favorite mug-the chipped one with the tiny painted daffodils. She'd brought it from Dallas, claiming it was lucky. I set it by the window so she could see the bayou when she sipped.

She shuffled in moments later, hair a soft mess, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She looked at the mug and smiled. ""You remember.""

""Of course I did,"" I said, pulling her into a one-armed hug and pecking the top of her head. ""Lucky mug, right?""

She nodded, leaning into my chest.

""This place feels... like we could actually breathe here. Like we could plant roots.""

""That's the plan,"" I said. ""Roots. You and me. Everything we dreamed about back at school, remember?""

She looked out the window, her voice soft. ""I just hope the town feels the same way.""

I turned her to face me. ""Then we'll show them who we are. We'll build the kind of life no one can ignore. You don't have to fit into this town, Ember. This town should be lucky to have you.""

Her eyes shimmered for just a second. ""You always make it sound so easy.""

""It's not easy,"" I admitted. ""But it's worth it. You're worth it. Every long night, every sideways glance, every moment it takes to prove we belong here together.""

She let out a breath, quiet but full of emotion. I watched her tuck her hair behind her ear and stare out over the bayou like she was trying to piece something together. I couldn't help but reach for her hand.

""I don't think I've told you enough,"" I said. ""How proud I am of you. For coming here with me. For believing in this crazy idea of starting over in a town that isn't exactly easy to win over. You're brave, Em. Braver than anyone I know.""

She gave me a look that said she was still figuring out how to take all of this in, but her fingers laced with mine. And for now, that was enough.

We sipped our coffee in silence, the rising sun painting streaks of gold over the bayou. I could already see the memories taking root.

This move wasn't just a return-it was a beginning. I wasn't just home. I was building a life. With Ember.

And I couldn't wait for everything that came next.



Ember's POV

The first week of school was magic. And while I loved every second of the chaos, part of my heart still tugged toward home. I missed my parents‚Äîthe way my mom would send me off with muffins and a pep talk, and how my dad always acted like I was about to conquer the world. We FaceTimed every night, and they both reminded me that this move was exactly where I was supposed to be. 'Love like yours and Cruz's doesn't come around twice,' my mom had said. 'Build your life where it feels right.' And I wanted that. With everything in me, I wanted this life with Cruz to work.

Sure, I was up before the sun, already in teacher mode before my first cup of coffee, but something about being back in a classroom‚Äîmy classroom‚Äîmade it all worth it. There was something sacred about that first-day energy. Tiny backpacks, nervous smiles, high-pitched voices calling out my name like it was the safest word they knew. I was exhausted in the best way. My arms were smudged with crayon marks, and I'd found glitter in my hair every night that week. And I wouldn't have changed a thing.

The kids were wild and wonderful, testing boundaries and hugging me like they'd known me forever. They grounded me.

But at home‚Äîaround Cruz's world‚ÄîI felt like I was walking a tightrope. Always balancing. Always smiling.

I didn't know many people outside Cruz's circle, but I recognized a few familiar faces from our brief visits to town. Sadie was one of them‚ÄîCruz's longtime friend. We'd crossed paths a handful of times over the years: quick hellos at holidays, shared tables at large gatherings. She was always nice, always polite. But something about the way she looked at me lingered just a beat too long, like she was taking mental notes.

The only real breath of fresh air came in the form of Kayla.

She was another kindergarten teacher at the school, and I met her on the first day when I spilled an entire tray of markers in the teacher's lounge. Instead of walking past like everyone else, she dropped to the floor to help, cracking a joke about needing roller skates and caffeine to survive.

""Hi, I'm Kayla. And you look like someone who could use a friend in this madhouse.""

From that moment on, she was exactly that. Bold, smart, and sharp-tongued in the best way, Kayla wasn't afraid to speak her mind. And the more time we spent together, the more I realized she was also fiercely protective. She reminded me of the big sister I never had. I hadn't known I needed a support system here‚Äîbut I had one now. And Kayla didn't hesitate to call out the nonsense, especially when it came to Sadie or the subtle slights from Cruz's mom.

Cruz had been working late again, helping his dad reorganize some of the older project files at the office. He'd texted me a few times during the day‚Äî

Can't wait to see you tonight. Miss your face.

You're going to crush this year. Those kids are lucky.

It helped. Reminded me that even if things felt wobbly, we were still us. Or at least trying to be.

Friday night, Sarah invited us over for dinner again. ""Just family,"" she said.

When we pulled into the driveway, I noticed Sadie's car.

I blinked. ""I thought this was just family.""

Cruz looked up from his phone. ""Sadie's always here. You know how our moms are.""

His tone was casual, like it hadn't even occurred to him that her presence might feel off. That twist in my stomach tightened. He didn't mean to dismiss me. He just... didn't see it. Not yet.

Dinner was crawfish √©touff√©e and cornbread, the kind of food that usually tasted like comfort.

I moved toward the seat next to Cruz, ready to slip in beside him, but Sadie got there first. She slid in quickly and smiled like she belonged there, already pouring his sweet tea as if it were routine. Then she blinked, looking between me and the empty seat.

""Oh, Ember‚Äîwere you about to sit here?"" she asked with an apologetic tilt of her head that didn't quite reach her eyes. ""Old habits.""

I shook my head gently. ""No worries. Actually, I like sitting here. I get to see his face when he talks.""

I paused just a moment before easing into the chair across from them.

I took the seat across from them.

Sarah launched into a story about Cruz's eighth-grade science fair, laughing at how he and Sadie built a cardboard bridge together.

""You should've seen them,"" she said, beaming. ""They were such a little team back then. Always building something. So much history.""

She looked right at me as she said it. The implication wasn't subtle.

I forced a smile. ""That's sweet.""

Kate, Sadie's mom, chimed in from the other end of the table. ""Well, Sadie always knew how to bring out the best in Cruz. They had such a rhythm together.""

""Like siblings,"" Cruz said, finally. He laughed, oblivious to the tension tightening my spine.

He meant it innocently. I knew that. But his loyalty to the past‚Äîto the comfort of people who'd always adored him‚Äîsometimes made him blind to the way it cut me.

Cruz, always trying to bridge the gap between his world and mine, turned to me after the first few bites.

""Ember's had the wildest week,"" he said, his eyes warm. ""Her kids already adore her.""

I smiled at him, grateful. ""They're sweet. Wild, but sweet.""

""Oh, tell them about the glitter incident,"" Cruz prompted.

I laughed. ""One of my students tried to make a 'friendship potion' out of glitter glue and juice boxes. It exploded all over the reading rug.""

Everyone chuckled politely. Cruz leaned in a little, his attention steady.

""She's kind of magical,"" he added, and for a second, I felt like maybe I did belong at that table.

Sadie let out a soft laugh. ""Remember when we tried to build a treehouse out of popsicle sticks and duct tape?"" she said, turning toward Cruz.

He grinned. ""We got as far as the first step before it collapsed.""

""Your mom was so mad we took all her freezer pops,"" Sadie added.

They both laughed, lost in the memory, and I smiled along with them, even though it suddenly felt like the spotlight had shifted.

Sarah raised her glass. ""To lifelong friends.""

""To loyalty,"" Kate added.

Cruz clinked his glass against theirs. ""To Ember,"" he said, finally catching my eye. ""For surviving her first week with twenty tiny humans.""

Everyone toasted politely, but I felt like the afterthought at my own celebration.

After dinner, I helped Sarah clear the dishes.

""You can just leave those, sweetie,"" she said, waving me off. ""Sadie knows where everything goes.""

I set the plate down slowly. ""I don't mind helping.""

She gave me a tight smile. ""Of course. You're very... accommodating.""

I said nothing, but my ears burned.

When we got home, I curled up on the couch while Cruz turned on the TV.

""You were quiet tonight,"" he said after a while.

I shrugged. ""Just tired.""

He nudged my foot with his. ""Or... was my mom too much?""

""Not just your mom."" I paused, choosing my words carefully. ""I feel like I keep getting pushed to the edges of everything. Like I'm there... but not really seen.""

Cruz looked confused. ""You're always seen, Em.""

""Not by them.""

He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. ""It's going to take time,"" he said gently. ""New places, new people... it takes a while to feel like home. But we'll get there. We'll make new memories‚Äîones that are ours.""

I wanted to believe him. I really did.

But promises meant something different when people kept forgetting to keep them.



Cruz's POV

I didn't realize how hard it would be‚Äîblending my past with my future.

Ember was everything. She was my person, my constant, my compass. She made my mornings easier‚Äîalways up before me, already packing my lunch or scribbling little notes in the corner of a paper napkin. Things like: You've got this, or Don't forget your coffee again.

She smiled through the chaos, met me at the door with food and softness and steadiness. I'd come home to warm meals, laundry folded, and her hand rubbing slow circles on my back while I unloaded the weight of the day. She never asked for anything in return. She just made space for me to breathe.

I told myself she was adjusting just fine. She never said otherwise. And I clung to that belief like it was fact, because the truth was‚ÄîI needed her to be okay. Because I barely felt like I was keeping up.

The business was dragging me under.

Taking over my dad's company had sounded like stepping into something familiar, something rooted. But it wasn't just blueprints and woodgrain like I remembered. It was liability insurance, payroll issues, zoning permits, and a hundred tiny decisions that didn't fit neatly into an architectural sketchpad. My days started before sunrise and ended with me passing out fully clothed on the couch, head swimming with schedules and estimates.

And the office‚ÄîGod, the office. My dad had boxes stacked so high in the storage basement that it felt more like an archaeological dig than a workspace. We were digitizing everything, and I was elbow-deep in brittle folders, coughing through decades of dust and mildew. My muscles ached, my mind buzzed, and I hated how often I caught myself drifting through the day without a single thought about Ember‚Äîuntil it was too late.

She never complained. Not once. She just... softened. Smiled smaller. Spoke less. And every time I noticed, it sent a pang of guilt straight through my chest.

One evening, I stopped by my mom's to drop off a few folding tables she'd lent us for the garage. As I stepped through the door, I called out, ""Hey, Mom. Just dropping these off real quick‚ÄîEmber's waiting on me.""

She popped her head around the corner from the dining room, where she was elbow-deep in old photo albums and handwritten recipes.

""Back here,"" she said. ""You've got good timing.""

It wasn't until I stepped fully into the kitchen that I noticed Sadie sitting at the counter, like she'd always belonged there. Her smile lit up like someone had flipped a switch. I blinked.

""Sadie,"" I said, trying to mask my surprise.

She twirled a spoon in her hand. ""Of course Ember's waiting. She always has something warm and homemade, doesn't she?""

""I won't stay long,"" I said quickly, more to remind myself than them. ""Ember's making enchiladas. I've been thinking about them all day.""

Sadie raised an eyebrow and tilted her head. ""Of course she is,"" she said, her voice all sugar. ""She probably irons your napkins too."" She let out a soft laugh, like it was a harmless joke, but something in her tone made me pause.

She pointed to a dish on the counter. ""I was just dropping off a pecan pie my mom made, but your mom roped me into helping sort old pictures. You know how she gets when she's on a memory kick.""

Before I could respond, my mom called out from the dining room, ""Cruz, come look at this one‚Äîyour fourth-grade science fair. You and Sadie with those awful matching shirts!""

And just like that, I was pulled in. One photo turned into a stack. One story into another. Sadie chimed in with exaggerated details, laughing too loud, nudging my shoulder like we were back in high school. I kept glancing at the clock, meaning to leave. But every time I stood up, someone‚Äîeither Sadie or my mom‚Äîhad one more thing to show me, one more memory to tug on.

By the time I checked my phone again, nearly an hour had passed. And I still hadn't texted Ember.

""Cr/ap,"" I muttered, pushing away from the counter.

""I completely lost track of time‚ÄîEmber's probably wondering where I am.""

Sadie's smile slipped, just slightly. ""Tell her I said hi.""

I nodded, already grabbing my keys.

When I got home, the enchiladas were still warm, but Ember had already eaten. She sat curled on the couch, laptop open, red pen in hand. Grading.

""Sorry I'm late,"" I said, pecking her cheek. ""Got caught up at Mom's.""

She nodded without looking up. ""It's fine.""

But it wasn't. I could feel the space between us.

She clicked her pen shut and finally looked at me. ""Must've been a good conversation,"" she said. ""You were gone awhile.""

I hesitated. ""It wasn't just Mom.""

She paused, then gave a noncommittal, ""Mm.""

""Are we okay?"" I asked, sitting beside her.

After a moment, she added, ""Would you be okay if I didn't text you the next time I was late? If I just decided Kayla or someone else needed my time more than you did?""

Her voice wasn't sharp. It was soft. Honest. And it landed harder than if she'd yelled.

She finally looked at me. ""Cruz... do you really not see it?""

""See what?""

She closed the laptop and set it aside.

""Every time we're with your mom or Sadie, I feel like I'm being erased in slow motion. Like I'm a placeholder in your life instead of a partner.""

The words hit harder than I expected. Because deep down, I knew what she meant.

""That's not true,"" I said, voice rough. ""You're everything to me.""

""Then why does it feel like I'm the only one fighting for us in those rooms?""

I didn't have an answer. Not one that didn't sound like an excuse.

""I'll talk to my mom,"" I said quietly. ""I'll set some boundaries.""

She nodded. ""I'm not asking you to cut anyone out. I just need to know I matter. Out loud. In front of the people who keep pretending I don't.""

I reached for her hand. ""You do. And I'll prove it.""

And I meant it.

But part of me hated that it had taken her spelling it out for me to finally start seeing what had been right in front of me all along.



Ember's POV

It's hard to explain the exhaustion that comes from smiling too long. Not the good kind of smile, either. The kind you plaster on when you're trying not to fall apart.

The months from August to October bled together in a blur of routines and exhaustion. Early mornings, late nights. Cruz working overtime at the shop, me dragging myself through lesson plans, hallway duty, and trying to hold it all together. We passed like ships‚Äîbrief pecks, mumbled goodnights, forgotten conversations over reheated dinners. There was no pause, no breath, no real us anymore.

By mid-October, the weather cooled slightly, but the tension in my chest only got heavier. Between grading papers, helping Kayla organize the fall reading event at school, and dodging Cruz's mom's increasingly pointed comments about how ""Sadie always knew how to make herself useful,"" I felt like I was constantly bracing for a hit that hadn't landed yet.

And then came the Halloween party.

Halloween had always been my favorite. The colors, the crispness in the air, the excuse to transform into someone else for a night‚ÄîI loved everything about it. I loved the smell of cinnamon candles and caramel apples, the crunch of leaves under boots, the flicker of porch lights glowing over jack-o'-lanterns. Fall felt like change, but the good kind.

Back in college, Cruz and I had started a tradition of doing couple costumes. It started as a joke‚Äîone year we went as peanut butter and jelly‚Äîbut over time, it became something special. Something we planned for and looked forward to, even when everything else felt uncertain. It was ours.

This year, we chose Eric and Ariel. Corny, yes, but it was sentimental. I found the perfect flowing teal skirt and seashell top. Cruz had the crisp white shirt and navy pants. We were ready. I felt ready.

As we got into the car, I reached for his hand and smiled. ""You sure you're ready for this much Disney magic?""

He chuckled, squeezing my fingers. ""I've been ready. You make a better Ariel than the original. Honestly, Em... you look like a dream.""

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. ""You clean up pretty nice too, Prince Eric.""

He grinned. ""Let's go make everyone jealous.""

When we showed up to his parents' annual Halloween party, I actually felt good for the first time in weeks. For once, I wasn't the outsider‚ÄîI was the fianc√©e, standing proudly next to her Prince Eric.

That lasted about five minutes.

Sadie walked in ten minutes after us.

Wearing the same Ariel costume.

Only hers was tighter, flashier. She'd added glitter to the bodice and wore bright red lipstick that smeared when she smiled too wide. Her hair curled to perfection, and she made a dramatic entrance like she'd just stepped out of a commercial.

People noticed.

""Oh, look at that!"" Sarah laughed too loud. ""Two Ariels! How cute.""

Sadie beamed. ""What can I say? Great minds think alike.""

""I swear she must've stalked your Pinterest board,"" Kayla muttered to me, already clenching her drink tighter.

Cruz didn't say anything. Just laughed awkwardly and led me toward the drinks table.

""She probably didn't know,"" he whispered.

""Did you tell her what we were dressing up as?"" I asked.

""I mean... it might've come up last week. But I didn't think she'd copy it.""

Of course she did.

""Cruz."" I looked at him hard. ""Are you serious?""

He didn't answer, just scratched the back of his neck. ""It's probably just a coincidence.""

I gave him a look, but he avoided my eyes. That said enough.

The night blurred. Sadie found reasons to stand next to Cruz in every photo, giggling and tossing her hair. Sarah complimented her costume no less than six times. Kate made a joke about how Sadie looked more like Ariel from the movie.

""She's just got the right coloring,"" Sarah said, sipping her wine. ""And she always knew how to work a crowd.""

Kayla, never one to let nonsense slide, leaned in and whispered, ""More like she works angles like a reality show contestant.""

I smiled tightly. Cruz glanced at me, but said nothing. Even when I nudged him slightly during a picture Sadie tried to wedge herself into, he just kept smiling like nothing was wrong.

Kayla stepped in‚Äîliterally‚Äîlooping her arm through mine and saying, loud enough for half the room to hear, ""Let's keep the princess and her prince together, yeah?""

When Sarah gushed again over Sadie's glittery bodice, Kayla raised her drink and said, ""Guess they're handing out compliments for knock-offs tonight.""

Kate loudly commented later, ""It's just such a shame Sadie isn't in a serious relationship. She always did light up the room.""

Kayla nearly choked on her drink.

""Probably all that glitter.""

She didn't care that people were watching. In fact, I think she wanted them to. Every side glance, every fake-smile insult‚Äîthey didn't scare her. She stood between me and the worst of it like a shield wrapped in sarcasm and wine.

""Next year, you're going as Maleficent,"" she muttered. ""Let's show them what a real villain looks like.""

By the time Cruz and I got home, my smile had worn off.

The car ride had been mostly silent. I was too tired to pretend, and he seemed too oblivious to notice. Once we stepped through the door, I slipped out of my shoes and said nothing. The silence was thick, but I needed him to say something first. Anything.

He finally glanced at me, brow furrowed. ""You okay?""

I let out a breath and walked into the bedroom. ""Did you see the way she kept touching your arm?"" I asked, pulling pins from my hair, each one sharper than the last.

He sighed. ""Em, it's Halloween. Everyone was messing around.""

""Not everyone. Just her. And your mom ate it up.""

He rubbed the back of his neck, that same tired shrug in his voice. ""Maybe Sadie just wanted to feel like she was part of something.""

I blinked, stunned. The hurt simmered beneath my skin.

""She is part of something, Cruz. She inserted herself right into the middle of our night. And you let her. Again.""

He said nothing. Just stood there, hands at his sides like he couldn't decide whether to defend her or defuse me.

I stared at him, heart tight. ""Let me ask you something. What if Kayla had shown up to a party we were invited to‚Äîinserted herself into a couple's costume another friend planned, and then spent the whole night clinging to someone else's fianc√©? Would you really just brush it off? Would you still think it was harmless, that she just wanted to 'feel included'?""

Still, nothing.

He opened his mouth, like maybe he was going to try to defend her again.

""Don't,"" I said quietly, without turning around. ""I've had enough of her joining our night. I don't need her invading my dreams too.""

I turned away. My hands were shaking, but I wouldn't let him see that.

Because sometimes, silence says more than denial ever could.

I didn't push. I just walked into the bathroom and closed the door.

Because if I didn't, I might've said something I couldn't take back.

\##Chapter 1

¬†

The funeral had barely ended when my celebrity husband brought his pregnant sister-in-law home.

¬†

‚ÄúMy brother is gone, and she‚Äôs pregnant and needs care. As a public figure, I have to be responsible.‚Äù

¬†

Axel Franklin‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs hottest A-list star‚Äîspoke these words like he was delivering a press statement, calm and indisputable.

¬†

He carried Ella‚Äôs luggage and gave her our master bedroom.

¬†

And I could only watch coldly from the sidelines.

¬†

The first week, she was relatively quiet. The second week, she began to infiltrate.

¬†

She brought warm milk to the study, her voice soft and fragile: ‚ÄúFilming is so exhausting, you need proper rest.‚Äù

¬†

At dinner, she coughed lightly, hand pressed to her chest: ‚ÄúAxel, I feel a bit stuffy. Could you tell me about some interesting experiences from your shoots?‚Äù

¬†

In the middle of the night, she pretended to have breathing difficulties, calling Axel into her room to sing her to sleep.

¬†

I wasn‚Äôt an outsider to this world‚ÄîI was an investor‚Äôs daughter, intimately familiar with the entertainment industry.

¬†

I‚Äôd grown up surrounded by schemes and manipulation.

¬†

I could see her performance was flawless, every move calculated with precision.

¬†

But when I looked at Axel, his eyes held patience, even tenderness.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be more comfortable if you lie on your side when you rest.‚Äù

¬†

As he said this, his fingers gently touched her face.

¬†

My heart clenched painfully.

¬†

How I wanted to remind him‚ÄîI‚Äôm your wife, not her.

¬†

But the words stuck in my throat, leaving only the violent pounding of my heart.

¬†

Five years ago, I gave up the chance to join the board of directors for this marriage.

¬†

I abandoned my edge in the financial world just to be a quiet star‚Äôs wife.

¬†

Now I understood‚Äîin his eyes, a pregnant sister-in-law was more worthy of his protection than I was.

¬†

I walked into the study, my fingers ice-cold as I dialed the phone.

¬†

‚ÄúDad.‚Äù My voice trembled but held unprecedented determination. ‚ÄúI want a divorce.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

On the other end of the line, Frederick James asked in a low voice: ‚ÄúGrace, what happened?‚Äù

¬†

I told him everything that had occurred during this time.

¬†

From being forced to give up our bedroom, to the milk deliveries, to Axel going into her room at midnight to comfort her‚Ä¶

¬†

These seemingly trivial details pressed down on me like a mountain, suffocating.

¬†

For five years of marriage, I‚Äôd done everything to be Axel‚Äôs perfect wife.

¬†

I gave up my career, accompanied him to red carpets, learned the understated style he preferred.

¬†

I tried so hard to please him, only to be ignored in return.

¬†

He gave all his patience and tenderness to another woman.

¬†

After hearing everything, my father‚Äôs tone turned cold: ‚ÄúGrace, I support your decision. Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe investment in Franklin Entertainment was always backed by me. I can pull out anytime. Just make whatever decision makes you happy.‚Äù

¬†

After hanging up, I felt an unprecedented calm.

¬†

Perhaps because this disappointment had long prepared me for this moment.

¬†

I looked at the haggard woman in the mirror. Over these years, I‚Äôd sacrificed everything for marriage, almost forgetting who I used to be.

¬†

But starting now, I would change.

¬†

That night, I slept in the study.

¬†

The next morning, I walked into the kitchen.

¬†

Ella was already there.

¬†

She was wearing Axel‚Äôs shirt. That floral shirt‚ÄîI remembered it clearly. I‚Äôd personally chosen it for him, and he wore it to every awards ceremony.

¬†

But now it hung loose on her frame, unable to hide her protruding belly.

¬†

She hummed while making coffee, and when she saw me, she smiled slightly, as if nothing had happened.

¬†

‚ÄúGood morning, Grace. Didn‚Äôt sleep well? I heard you slept in the study.‚Äù

¬†

I stared at that shirt.

¬†

A dull pain shot through my chest.

¬†

My voice was cold, without inflection: ‚ÄúTake it off.‚Äù

¬†

Her smile froze.

I wasn‚Äôt an outsider to this world‚ÄîI was an investor‚Äôs daughter, intimately familiar with the entertainment industry.

¬†

I‚Äôd grown up surrounded by schemes and manipulation.

¬†

I could see her performance was flawless, every move calculated with precision.

¬†

But when I looked at Axel, his eyes held patience, even tenderness.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be more comfortable if you lie on your side when you rest.‚Äù

¬†

As he said this, his fingers gently touched her face.

¬†

My heart clenched painfully.

¬†

How I wanted to remind him‚ÄîI‚Äôm your wife, not her.

¬†

But the words stuck in my throat, leaving only the violent pounding of my heart.

¬†

Five years ago, I gave up the chance to join the board of directors for this marriage.

¬†

I abandoned my edge in the financial world just to be a quiet star‚Äôs wife.

¬†

Now I understood‚Äîin his eyes, a pregnant sister-in-law was more worthy of his protection than I was.

¬†

I walked into the study, my fingers ice-cold as I dialed the phone.

¬†

‚ÄúDad.‚Äù My voice trembled but held unprecedented determination. ‚ÄúI want a divorce.‚Äù

¬†

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

¬†

On the other end of the line, Frederick James asked in a low voice: ‚ÄúGrace, what happened?‚Äù

¬†

I told him everything that had occurred during this time.

¬†

From being forced to give up our bedroom, to the milk deliveries, to Axel going into her room at midnight to comfort her‚Ä¶

¬†

These seemingly trivial details pressed down on me like a mountain, suffocating.

¬†

For five years of marriage, I‚Äôd done everything to be Axel‚Äôs perfect wife.

¬†

I gave up my career, accompanied him to red carpets, learned the understated style he preferred.

¬†

I tried so hard to please him, only to be ignored in return.

¬†

He gave all his patience and tenderness to another woman.

¬†

After hearing everything, my father‚Äôs tone turned cold: ‚ÄúGrace, I support your decision. Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe investment in Franklin Entertainment was always backed by me. I can pull out anytime. Just make whatever decision makes you happy.‚Äù

¬†

After hanging up, I felt an unprecedented calm.

¬†

Perhaps because this disappointment had long prepared me for this moment.

¬†

I looked at the haggard woman in the mirror. Over these years, I‚Äôd sacrificed everything for marriage, almost forgetting who I used to be.

¬†

But starting now, I would change.

¬†

That night, I slept in the study.

¬†

The next morning, I walked into the kitchen.

¬†

Ella was already there.

¬†

She was wearing Axel‚Äôs shirt. That floral shirt‚ÄîI remembered it clearly. I‚Äôd personally chosen it for him, and he wore it to every awards ceremony.

¬†

But now it hung loose on her frame, unable to hide her protruding belly.

¬†

She hummed while making coffee, and when she saw me, she smiled slightly, as if nothing had happened.

¬†

‚ÄúGood morning, Grace. Didn‚Äôt sleep well? I heard you slept in the study.‚Äù

¬†

I stared at that shirt.

¬†

A dull pain shot through my chest.

¬†

My voice was cold, without inflection: ‚ÄúTake it off.‚Äù

¬†

Her smile froze.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI said‚Äîtake off the shirt.‚Äù

¬†

Advice?","I met Jack a month after I broke up with my long-term ex-boyfriend. Jack is gentleman, sweet, fun, and easy to connect with. We share the same values and balance each other out like yin and yang, though he‚Äôs a bit more extreme than I am. After 2 weeks of dating, he told me he has three kids (14M, 13M, and 8F). He has full custody, and their mother is completely out of the picture after cheating on him over five years ago. Since then, he‚Äôs focused entirely on raising his children and providing them a stable home. They‚Äôve moved several times, and he isolated himself socially out of fear of running into people who knew him or his ex-wife.

Despite learning all this, I chose to let him stay in my life. I was lonely and still in shock from my breakup, but Jack helped me process my emotions and be kinder to myself. He encouraged me to continue with my bar review even when I planned to postpone it. During that period, he fully supported me (cooking, bringing me food and coffee, going to the gym with me, driving me around for errands, and doing countless thoughtful things my ex never did). He cared for me during the most difficult and defining moment of my life. Every day of the bar exam week, he surprised me with flowers just because he felt like it. All of these were new feelings for me. After all, I had two graduations, in college and in law school, and my ex didn‚Äôt even bother to attend either.

When I finished the bar exam last month, Jack admitted he was afraid I might leave now that I no longer ‚Äúneed‚Äù him. But I don‚Äôt want to leave him at all. I didn‚Äôt expect to fall this deeply. I always wanted a Double Income, No Kids (DINK) relationship and thought I wouldn‚Äôt fall for someone like him yet here I am.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt hate kids. It‚Äôs just that my mind has been in a ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get pregnant‚Äù mode for the longest time because I‚Äôve always been so focused on my career. Over time, I leaned toward wanting a DINK relationship. But now, part of me wonders if the universe is giving me another option. Maybe I can give motherly love without actually being pregnant. I‚Äôm so confused. 

It‚Äôs been 10 months since we met, and every day, I fall for Jack even more. He‚Äôs shown me love in ways I never knew were possible, things my ex couldn‚Äôt do in 10 years. I feel cherished and deeply loved.

Recently, Jack asked me to move in with him and the kids (I have not met them yet). I value my peace and the solitude of living alone, I don‚Äôt know if I am ready to give this up. From his stories, it‚Äôs clear that his kids long for a mother figure, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready or willing to take on that role. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to be a step-parent.

I need advice on whether I should continue this relationship or end it before things get more serious.",1,1760074470.0,SingleDads,7,0.67,False

The U.S. dollar is strong near a two-month high against major currencies, putting pressure on commodity prices, while copper and steel stocks rally given supply constraints from China export policies.

Selective exposure to growth leaders like¬†[NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA)¬†and¬†[MSFT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MSFT)¬†is warranted, balanced with caution on regulatory and policy risks, especially in automotive and energy sectors.

This is so big for me because I‚Äôve never actually asked anyone out before, all my relationships have been initiated by the other person because I‚Äôve always chickened out. Also, this is after a NIGHTMARISH situationship last spring (she told me she didn‚Äôt want to date a woman and then posted her new boyfriend on Instagram </3) so I‚Äôm just so happy to be experiencing the exciting butterflies-in-the-stomach-romance. 

I met this absolutely gorgeous girl on campus while tabling for an org I‚Äôm in and we flirted a little right off the bat. I immediately liked her, but didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was until I saw her in the library and we talked and my face was incredibly red. We‚Äôd wave to each other and compliment each other, but had our first full-on conversation on Monday when I saw her at a coffee stand on-campus and we sat and talked for like half an hour. I asked her if she wanted to go to the performative lesbian contest our LGBTQ resource center was hosting and she said yes, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if she knew I meant it romantically. We kept texting and got coffee yesterday then went to trivia together, but my friend said that she didn‚Äôt get a flirty vibe from her and I started to second-guess everything. 

Well, today was the contest, and she competed! I gave her my carabiner and lesbian flag (as well as a butch bait pin), and then with the encouragement of our mutual friend, I worked up the courage to offer to give her a lipstick mark right before. She said yes, so I kissed her on the cheek and genuinely almost passed out. 

During the second stage of the competition, the semifinalists were asked who their favorite lesbian was, and she said ‚ÄúMy favorite lesbian is the girl who gave me this kiss on the cheek. There she is!‚Äù and I swear I turned so red. Afterwards I knew I had to take the opportunity and actually ask her out or I‚Äôd regret it forever (or at least a very long time), as has happened with almost every other girl I‚Äôve liked. 

After the composition, I asked her if she wanted to get dinner and clarified that i meant as a date, and she said she would love to! I kissed her on the cheek again, and she said that even though she didn‚Äôt win the competition she won two prizes and pointed to the lipstick marks <3 we‚Äôre going out for dinner on Monday, and she said she‚Äôd get me back for the lipstick kisses and I‚Äôm just so excited I wanna screammm.

But there is some type of pepper I've tasted before in some chicken before that tastes extra peppery, and I haven't been able to figure out. Weirdly it's usually in frozen chicken or cheap prepared chicken, but I enjoy the taste. 

It's often in popcorn chicken, like I grabbed some popcorn chicken from Walmart's deli recently and it had this taste. I've tasted it in a handful of frozen chicken products too (like, breaded frozen strips or popcorn chicken), and I think maybe in some fast food but I don't remember for sure. It's just like, I guess an extra bitey or peppery tasting pepper.

I've cooked (both chicken and other things of course) using various ground black peppers, as well as some freshly ground black peppers, and it never matched that taste. Admittedly I'm talking about some of those random relatively cheap ones from the grocery store where the peppercorns come in a bottle with a grinder on it, and then a few times I've bought peppercorns and ground them in my coffee grinder. And of course I've tried varying the amount of pepper, but none of it makes it have this same taste. I also tried buying white pepper a couple of times, but it was years ago. That didn't have the taste either, unless again it was just because I didn't use a super high quality brand.

I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything creepy.
I just wanted a cheap external drive for video backups.
The pawn shop down the street had a few, still sealed in static bags. The clerk said they came from an estate sale, a computer lab that shut down years ago.
When I got home and plugged one in, there was only a single file on it.

This is what the file contains ‚¨áÔ∏è:

It started about three months ago, the dreams.
Not nightmares, not at first.
When I closed my eyes, I woke up in another life, a small, old apartment with creaky floors and a constant hum of traffic outside. The curtains were yellowed, and the air always smelled faintly of dust and rain.
I lived as someone else.
I worked at a coffee shop. I had friends that I recognized, but didn‚Äôt know. I even had a scar on my arm that didn‚Äôt exist when I woke up.
The strange part wasn‚Äôt the realism, it was the continuity.
Every night, I picked up right where I‚Äôd left off; The same world, the same people, even days passing by. I started keeping track.  I began writing down details, places, names, all of which matched each other, night after night.
It wasn‚Äôt a dream. It was another life.
At first, it was almost comforting. I preferred that world. The colors felt softer there. My other self,  I‚Äôll call her Victoria, was calmer, even happier.
One night, I felt her hesitate.
She was washing dishes, staring out the window at a dark street, when she whispered,
‚ÄúI dream about you too.‚Äù

I remember freezing because in that instant, it wasn‚Äôt me thinking it, it was her.
From then on, it got worse.
She started leaving notes for me, scrawled in her world‚Äôs handwriting, appearing on my nightstand when I woke up.
They said things like:
‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt both exist.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIf I wake up as you, you‚Äôll disappear.‚Äù

I stopped sleeping. I tried staying awake for days, but exhaustion always won.
Every time I drifted off, she seemed closer. Her world is darker. 
My reflection there lingered too long, as if testing the boundaries between us.
Then one night, I woke up and the air smelled like dust and rain.
The floorboards creaked. 
The curtains were yellowed.
I was Victoria.
I panicked. I tried everything, pinching, running outside, screaming. No one noticed anything strange. It wasn‚Äôt a dream anymore. I had switched.
I searched desperately for a way back.
I tried sleep, meditation, inflicted pain onto myself. 
Nothing worked.
Until one night, I felt exhaustion pull at me again, and I thought, maybe I‚Äôll wake up in my home.
When I opened my eyes, I was lying in my own bed again. Relief washed through me. My room. My world. My handwriting on the notes.
Only‚Ä¶ the handwriting was slightly different.
A little neater.
And when I walked to the mirror, the reflection smiled first, and said:
‚ÄúI told you, only one of us gets to wake up.‚Äù


For days, I tried to convince myself it was just a nightmare.
Everything felt wrong.
Not drastically, just enough to unsettle me.
The sunlight in my apartment came in from the wrong angle. My phone‚Äôs wallpaper had changed. The coffee mug I always used, the one with a chip on the rim, it was perfectly smooth.
Little things, but they piled up like whispers.
I started testing myself.
I‚Äôd write down small facts - my birthday, my address, the name of my first pet,  and then check them later.
Sometimes the writing wasn‚Äôt mine.
Sometimes the answers were close, but not right.
I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was forgetting‚Ä¶ or if I was remembering someone else‚Äôs life.
The reflection was always there.
At first, it just watched. Subtle things, like blinking half a second too late. But then it began moving differently. I‚Äôd raise my hand, and it would raise the wrong one. I‚Äôd tilt my head, and it would move ever so slightly. 
Every night, right before bed, I‚Äôd hear it whisper through the dark glass:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the wrong place.‚Äù

I stopped looking at mirrors. I covered them with blankets, avoided windows, even put tape on my phone camera.
But‚Ä¶reflections don‚Äôt need glass.
They show up wherever light bends, in the corner of a spoon, in the shimmer of a puddle, in a computer screen that‚Äôs just gone black.
The last straw was my voicemail.
I never use it, but one morning, there were seven missed calls, all from my own number.
When I played the first message, I heard heavy breathing. Then, in a trembling voice, I hear myself:
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not asleep anymore. She‚Äôs in your world now.‚Äù

Every message after that was the same voice - the same me, pleading, whispering, begging for help.
The final voicemail didn‚Äôt even contain words, Just laughter. 
Slow and careful, like it was practicing.
That night, I dreamed again.
I was standing in the yellow-curtained apartment. Only this time, she was there. Victoria.
She looked exactly like me, except for the smile.
She said,
 ‚ÄúI like your world better. I think I‚Äôll keep this one.‚Äù
I tried to wake up, but the air there felt thicker. She stepped closer, touching my face and for a moment, I could feel her fingers in both worlds. Cold. Shaky. Too real.
When I finally woke up, the blanket over my mirror was gone.
And written across the glass, in fogged breath, were four words:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still dreaming, Victoria.‚Äù


I haven‚Äôt slept in days.
Or maybe I‚Äôve been sleeping this entire time.
It‚Äôs hard to tell anymore.
The boundaries between waking and dreaming have dissolved, like paint running together in rainwater.
Every time I blink, something changes. The hallway lengthens. The air hums faintly, like a refrigerator running somewhere just out of sight. Sometimes my apartment looks exactly as I remember, then times where the walls seem to breathe.
I‚Äôve started leaving notes for myself again, the way she used to.
The handwriting shifts slightly each time, and sometimes the ink smudges into letters I didn‚Äôt write:
‚ÄúStop moving.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs almost here.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre writing these.‚Äù

My reflection, if that‚Äôs what it still is, doesn‚Äôt wait anymore.
When I pass a dark surface, it doesn‚Äôt copy me. It observes. Its eyes move first, as if anticipating what I‚Äôll do. It‚Äôs always smiling. Always patient.
I caught it standing still once while I moved.
For a moment, I thought it was gone, that I had finally separated from it.
Then the lights flickered, and it turned its head the wrong way around to look at me.
Now, the reflections appear where they shouldn‚Äôt.
Inside the microwave door. In the window of a turned-off TV.
Last night, I saw my own face in the static of an unplugged monitor.
It mouthed something over and over.
I think it was my name.
Or hers.
I can‚Äôt remember which one I am anymore.
When I look in the mirror now, the apartment behind me looks‚Ä¶ cleaner.
No notes. No blankets over the glass. Everything in perfect order, like how I used to keep it before the dreams began.
Sometimes I see her there, standing behind me.
Other times, I see only myself ‚Äî but the wrong side of my face twitches.
The worst part?
I‚Äôve started hearing voices from that world while I‚Äôm awake - faintly, like an old radio left on in another room.
They‚Äôre saying my name.
Sometimes they ask where I‚Äôve gone.
Sometimes they just laugh.
Lately, I‚Äôve noticed something new.
When I close my eyes, I don‚Äôt fall asleep anymore.
I wake up‚Ä¶ somewhere else.
Each time, the world looks a little more like the one with the yellow curtains.
It‚Äôs getting harder to tell which one is real.
Maybe none of them are. 
Maybe they never were.
Tonight, when I looked into the mirror‚Ä¶
She didn‚Äôt smile. She looked afraid.
She whispered,
 ‚ÄúWake up, please. I don‚Äôt want to be you anymore.‚Äù
Behind her, through the reflection‚Äôs glass,
I could see someone standing behind me.

The night before it ended, I decided to stop running from mirrors.
If the two of us were tangled together, one had to face the other.
I turned off every light except the one above the bathroom sink.
The bulb hummed steady, rhythmic, like a heartbeat trapped in glass.
I took down the blanket and waited for the surface to clear.
For a few seconds the reflection was ordinary.
Then the room behind her began to change: the yellow curtains, the flickering streetlight, rain dripping down panes that didn‚Äôt exist here.
She stared back, wide-eyed, trembling.
For the first time, I realized I was the one smiling.
The mirror rippled. A sound, thin as static, filled the air.
Both worlds were aligning. Edges overlapping like film reels out of sync.
The sink‚Äôs cold porcelain under my hands felt wrong, softer, like wet paper.
She raised her hand in warning. I raised mine in greeting.
We touched the glass.
It didn‚Äôt shatter. It folded.
The hum of the light grew louder until it was all there was, no sound, no thought, just vibration. The apartment stretched outward, infinite copies of itself spinning away like reflections in opposite mirrors.
In each one, another me stared back.
Some were smiling. Some were screaming.
One stepped forward.
Everything went white.
‚Ä¶
When color returned, I was standing in the yellow-curtained apartment.
Only this time, the curtains were open.
Outside was my own building. 
My world, seen from across the street.
In the window opposite of mine, I saw her. She was moving inside of my apartment, wearing my face, answering my phone, living my life.
She looked up, saw me, and mouthed something.
I couldn‚Äôt hear it, but I read the words on her lips:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dreaming, still.‚Äù

The lightbulb above me flickered once and went dark.
In the black glass of the window, I saw countless reflections waiting, each one a fraction late, each one smiling,
each one whispering,
‚ÄúWake up.‚Äù

This is where it ended. 

I found the story above in a corrupted folder on a hard drive I bought from a pawn shop.
The file was named ‚Äúsecond_you.txt.‚Äù
There was no author listed, just a string of random numbers that looked like a date: 11-07-2024. 
At first, I thought it was just someone‚Äôs short horror piece, until I noticed something strange.
Every time I opened the file, one line changed.
Not added, changed.
Usually it was small: a different word, a missing comma. But after reading it a few times, I realized the changes were specific.  They‚Äôve corrected how I was sitting, what room I was in, even the reflection on my monitor.
The last version I opened had a new sentence at the end, one I swear wasn‚Äôt there before:
‚ÄúStop reading. She‚Äôs with you now.‚Äù

I closed the file immediately.
But when I looked at my screen‚Äôs reflection‚Ä¶
It was smiling back at me.

Today the post is different , is the kind of posts that I used to post, when I started blogging, like this one [**Who I‚Äôm I? A writer or a blogger?**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/who-im-i-a-writer-or-a-blogger/uncategorized/)¬† my posts were not about recipes, but mainly [**thoughts**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/my-thoughts-on-body-image-issue/uncategorized/), experiences and opinions. You can [**find them here**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/category/uncategorized/).

***That was my idea about blogging****.* But then life changed in so many ways. Cooking, baking and photography took place on the blog.

At the beginning of June, I saw a post in a vegan group on Facebook, about a study of the effect of vegan food on empathy. It caught my attention immediately. I read it, contacted the person who posted it, and asked her for more details about the study.

I was always interested in human behavior and everything related to it. Long time ago, before I got obsessed with food (hence the blog, and [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/nutrizonia/)) I took online courses in¬† psychology and social psychology. Also, I was a volunteer in a crisis community center in Iowa city. They trained us very well, on how to respond to calls in an empathetic way, and how to give emotional support. Not advice, not therapy , but emotional support and helping them to feel better.

S**o I took this study seriously, and I had vegan dishes and snacks for three days**. If you are subscribed to the blog, you know that I post lots of vegan dishes here. You can find the categories [**Vegan**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/category/recipes/vegan-2/)¬† also, [**Vegan & Gluten Free**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/category/recipes/gluten-free-vegan/) on the homepage.

# The experience of vegan days

The experience was a bit *hard*. I'll tell you, the days were not consecutive, that's made it a bit easier. I had many vegan dishes before for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and desserts. But I've never had a **FULL DAY!** It was easy to pick up what to eat, because I have good knowledge of vegan alternatives. But I felt restrained,¬† since I was staying at my parents in Jordan, so many things were unavailable. However, they had plenty of fruits and vegetables.

**I relied mostly on:**

* [**Oatmeal**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/tag/oatmeal/), like my [**mocha oats**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/coconut-mocha-oatmeal/recipes/)
* Fresh fruits & vegetables.
* Nut butter, like natural[ **peanut butter**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/vegan-gluten-free-peanut-butter-cookies/recipes/)
* Beans that are cooked and mashed like[ **Hummus**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/the-classic-hummus-recipe-you-will-ever-need/recipes/), and foul [**mudammas**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/foul-mudammas-mashed-fava-beans/recipes/)
* Also, [**falafel sandwiches**](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/how-to-make-falafel/) were really perfect healthy snack, despite the fact the falafel pieces are fried, but the sandwich's were full with tahini salad, hummus and vegetables which made it are very flavorful and fulfilling.
* And soy milk with coffee, to feel more fulfilled.

**What I felt, most of the time is**

# I'm Hungry

I kind of had a brain fog, I was thinking of food most of the times. I had real fatigue. Also, I didn't take my supplements as there were no evidence they are vegan, except one. It was stated on the bottle, it was suitable for vegans. The hardest part was giving up on **eggs and cheese**. Since, I almost have eggs for breakfast, I missed it dearly. [**.**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/coconut-mocha-oatmeal/recipes/) **I didn't count the calories,**¬† I admit, *it was a mistake*. But it was holiday, and I didn't want to be busy counting grams and calories. I could had less than my usual days.

But as normal person and even dietitian, **I don't enjoy counting calories all day, nor believe in it** (Not for weight loss thou) to ensure that I'm not hungry or not eating much. **We are not living for that**, that's my main concerns for most diet plans and trends. You spend plenty of time, thinking what you should eat, and how you can find alternative for your special diet. (of course I'm talking about healthy person with no allergies).

The hardest day was, when I went for a **run in the morning**. I ran **6km** and the hot weather also made it worse . I thanked god that black tea & black coffee are vegan options because they at my favorite¬† drinks. (Most of the snack and dishes I had, are on my [**Instagram highlights**](https://www.instagram.com/nutrizonia/), under the name **vegan days**)

**However, Few food that helped a lot in filling up without filling my stomach:**¬†

* [**Spirulina**](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-spirulina)
* Mushrooms

**Spirulina** has complete proteins, strengthen your stamina and increase significantly your energy level, you can take in powder form or tablets, [**You can get it here** ](https://amzn.to/3yICk7v)¬†. **Mushroom**, contain traces of vitamin B12 which is essential and almost not found but in animal products, so it's a major concern for vegans.

My niece- she is **a teen-**¬† wanted to do this experiment with me. I said of course, **YOU CAN**. The first day, we almost ate the same food and but more quantities for her. We were eager and enthusiastic, that day passed smoothly. However, the food we had on the second day, **was not enough for her,** and I blame myself for that. It seems the meals we had, didn't meet her energy needs. So she was a bit lethargic, and I asked her to stop the experiment, and not complete a third day. If she really wants to follow vegan diet for other reasons, I would have certainly helped her, but for the sake of the study, I didn't want to take any risks.

**I didn't actually worked enough to have balanced days. It would require more food prepping**. And lastly, I won't rely on vegan processed food, like cheese, burger, or even proteins shakes. That's besides that most plant milks are not enough, and inadequate.

**The study questionnaire**

The questions were focusing on our feelings towards others like friends, and how do we feel regarding some pictures and so on. Three vegan days didn't make me MORE empathetic, and I'm sure they are not enough as a measure. However, I found that I was more calm on vegan days, but less energetic anyway.¬† It made me pause and think of how **less empathetic** I feel these days, and certainly.¬† Because of life tragedies, I do feel like now I'm immune to empathy, and like I'm putting emotions on the side, but **this is not right**, I believe we need to feel with others and be empathetic. **But I feel actually empathetic with vegan themselves**, people criticize them, for what they choose to eat, and when.

**What I mostly ate was simple vegan dishes, many that you can find on the blog, to name a few:**

# Bottom line

I don't think I even gonna eat **fully vegan, and that's not a medical advice, it's just my opinions¬†and¬†thoughts**¬†and I did write before, about my [**omnivorous diet**](http://www.nutrizonia.com/im-an-omnivore-and-proud-to-be/nutritionist-confessions/).

So if you believe in animal rights, or you want to follow a vegan diet for other reasons, go ahead. But you need to plan ahead, and to seek a medical advice if you feel tired or sick.

Scored an old Ascaso Dream model (MF? Up? I saw the same model in some old seattle coffee gear videos) from a garage sale and figured out how to (in theory) steam milk and pull a shot. 

My espresso-making could certainly use some more practice but the milk is more problematic right now, I can't get it to foam at all. I kick it under the (panarello) steam wand after purging the system into a different cup and open the valve. I find at best I can get like 15 big bubbles that vanish by the time the machine cools enough to make the espresso.

I've tried holding the pitcher down low, up high, covering the intake hole, barely covering it, not covering it. Tried opening the steam valve only a little, tried opening it all the way. Tried angling it every which way. Every time something seems to go wrong, with the most frequent result being very violently moving milk that succeeds primarily in jumping out of the pitcher onto my hand and not much in the way of foam.

Things that I think might be suspect:

 - The milk pitcher I have is teeny tiny, only holds about 150ml. It was sold with the machine. I have no idea what measurements are expected or normal with this stuff, I just thought for a cappuccino you try to half and half milk and espresso
 - The steam is really hot, it heats up way fast and by the time I purge the wand and actually get my milk under the head the built-in thermometer reads 150C/302F. And that's just the max on the thermometer, could be getting even hotter I imagine. Does it matter? 
 - My technique is just galaxy level bad. Can't speak to this one, cause I don't even know what I may or may not be doing right or wrong. Tried watching a lot of videos but I feel like I'm doing the same thing and just getting an entirely different result.
 - Something is busted in the machine. No idea how to diagnose it though. No reason to suspect this one as everything else works fine, aside from a lot of scale I still need to clean out. Descaler is in the mail already.

So...I guess, any suggestions? Anyone struggled with this as well and have ideas or videos that helped them?",1,1760072959.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1o2s5dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o2s5dx/lonely/,Lonely.,"My mother was a lonely woman.

She wasn‚Äôt perpetually sad. She didn‚Äôt drag around the house in the same pajamas for days on end, I didn‚Äôt see any tears day-to-day.

But sometimes at night I could hear her crying in her room.

I could hear her whispering pleas to God, asking for a man.

When she was sad, she worked in our garden a lot. We had fresh flowers, vegetables, even pumpkins sometimes.

I would help her too, and I had asked her why she liked to garden. She said it was therapeutic, like she could get in the dirt and bury all her problems and bad feelings away. Then they become something beautiful.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for the soul.‚Äù, she would say with a sad smile.

My dad wasn‚Äôt in the picture from even before I was born, and I think Mom was worried about me not having a strong male figure in my life. That it would stunt my emotional growth, or cause me to have issues later on in relationships.

My mom was pretty too, especially when I was younger. I would see the other moms give her a narrow stare when she came to get me from school, and how the dads would offer to come over to ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything at the house we needed.

My mom would always smile politely and say no thank you, but that didn‚Äôt stop the moms from their jealousy.

I knew she would go on dates. She would tell me when she would. She was always happy for a while after the date, and then one day she would be sad again. When I would ask about it, she would just say the same thing.

‚ÄúSometimes things don‚Äôt work out, but we all deserve love. I promise I won‚Äôt ever give up on love.‚Äù

I would wish that she could meet a nice guy who maybe worked at a toy store, or an ice cream shop. Then they could get married and I would make out like a bandit. But as the years went on, no new guy seemed to stick around.

When I was about 8, the crying at night stopped again.

She had been on a date the night before, and I had a sitter from the neighborhood watching me. When I woke up the next morning, mom was smiling and humming in the kitchen.

‚ÄúAre you making pancakes?‚Äù, I asked excitedly.

When she turned to me, she looked like she was glowing from the inside out.

‚ÄúYes I am, do you want chocolate chips?‚Äù, she asked me, pouring a spoonful of batter onto the hot skillet.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù, I cheered, pulling out my chair at our kitchen table.

When we were eating, I asked her if her date was fun.

She took a small sip of her coffee, and smiled into the mug.

‚ÄúIt was so fun, we talked all about you. He was also a gentleman and made sure I made it home safe. That‚Äôs very important.‚Äù, she responded, stars dancing in her eyes.

‚ÄúIs he nice? Can I meet him? Does he own a toy store? Does he have a dog? I want a dog! Does he-‚Äú

‚ÄúWoah, woah!‚Äù, my mom interrupted me laughing, ‚ÄúMaybe all that sugar was a bad idea! He is very nice, and I‚Äôm sure you can meet him soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow soon?‚Äù, I asked, eyes wide.

She seemed to choose her words carefully.

‚ÄúI suppose whenever the time is right.‚Äù, she answered, passing the maple syrup to me.

I was ecstatic. My mom looked so happy, and I thought that maybe if I met him, he would want to marry my mom and live with us!

The crying at night stopped immediately, but was replaced with low voices talking. A man and a woman.

I couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying, but it sounded like the woman was upset.

The next morning, I asked her who she was talking to the night before in her room.

‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù, she asked, pouring her coffee from the pot.

‚ÄúI heard a man in your room, it sounded like you were mad.‚Äù, I clarified.

She snorted and shook her head.

‚ÄúNo honey, that‚Äôs my audiobook. My doctor said listening to them before going to sleep would help me relax. I even listen to them when I take baths sometimes, they‚Äôre very soothing. Remember when we went to check them out at the library together?‚Äù, she asked me.

I did remember, she got a few different sets and they were in hard cases.

‚ÄúOh, okay. Did they help?‚Äù, I asked her.

She nodded.

‚ÄúI think so, I‚Äôve never slept better.‚Äù, she said with a smile.

The next few nights, the voices in her room continued, but they seemed quieter. Like she turned the volume lower so she wouldn‚Äôt disturb me again.

Several weeks went by, and every morning she would glow. She would make the best breakfasts, every night was movie night, and I knew it was because of her new boyfriend.

As far as I knew though, she hadn‚Äôt seen him again in person besides their first date.

‚ÄúDo you talk on the phone with him?‚Äù, I asked her.

She laughed softly.

‚ÄúYes, we talk frequently, why do you ask?‚Äù, she responded, turning towards me.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt gone out at night again, the babysitter hasn‚Äôt come back.‚Äù, I explained.

‚ÄúAhhhh, I see. I do see him when you‚Äôre at school. We like to eat lunch together, which is easy for me since I work from home.‚Äù, she explained, smiling warmly at me.

‚ÄúWhen can I meet him?‚Äù, I asked her.

‚ÄúSoon, baby. Hopefully soon. I know he will just love you.‚Äù, she told me, pulling me into a hug.

‚ÄúCan I know his name?‚Äù, I said into her shirt.

‚ÄúTim, his name is Tim.‚Äù, she responded.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I was getting everything I never thought I would have. I began to dream of family road trips, matching Halloween costumes, Christmas morning. Even though I didn‚Äôt have a clear vision of his face yet, I knew he would be handsome and kind. Exactly what my mom needed.

I just had to be patient.

A few weeks later, mom let me pick a scary movie to watch for our movie night. She warned me that it would keep me up all night, but I assured her I wasn‚Äôt scared. She reluctantly sighed and put it on, settling into the couch with a glass of red wine.

In the opening scene, there was a scary man in the house, and the teenage girl screamed and just backed up into a corner.

‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt she call the police?‚Äù, I asked my mom.

My mom snorted.

‚ÄúIn real life she would, but this is a movie so it‚Äôs all pretend.‚Äù, she explained.

30 minutes later, I was holding a pillow in front of my face, shaking at the terrifying man that filled our screen.

‚ÄúOkay, Mom you were right. I‚Äôm scared..‚Äù, I whimpered. When I turned towards her, I saw she was fast asleep on the couch beside me, snoring softly. Her now empty wine glass still in her hand.

I flicked the tv off, cloaking the room in darkness, before covering her with a blanket and moving the glass to the coffee table.

‚ÄúGoodnight, I love you.‚Äù, I whispered, kissing her cheek.

I went to my room and tucked myself into my bed, nightlight on its brightest setting, but I was restless.

I tossed and turned, imagining my jacket hanging over my chair as a monster crouched low.

The curtains became a billowing ghost.

The hum from the heater sounded like a growl.

I sat up, sweating.

I put my hands over my eyes, and sighed deeply.

Then I remembered my mother‚Äôs audiobooks, and how the dull conversations did sound soothing.

I was sure she wouldn‚Äôt mind if I borrowed some for the night, since she was sleeping so soundly in the living room.

I leapt from my bed, and walked carefully down the hall to her room, quietly clicking the door open so I wouldn‚Äôt wake her up.

Her room had a soft glow, as she left her lamp on next to the bed.

I reached her nightstand, looking for the small tape player she thrifted a few years ago, but it was nowhere to be seen.

‚ÄúWhere is it..‚Äù, I whispered, gently moving books and jewelry boxes around her room looking for the black box.

‚ÄúMaybe she left it in the bathroom..?‚Äù, I pondered out loud, opening the door to the wide space and flicking on the light.

And I wasn‚Äôt prepared for what I saw.

Some nights, it‚Äôs all I can see.

A grown man stood in the shower wearing a pair of what seemed to be basketball shorts, with chains around his ankles and wrists. Bruises crowded his face and visible body, and deep cuts ranging from fresh to mostly healed.

When I flicked the light on, he jolted, and his gaze snapped up to me. His eyes were filled with hate, venom. To this day, no one has ever looked at me with such disdain.

I was waiting for him to scream, or yell curse words at me, but I only heard muffled sounds.

I realized his mouth was duct taped.

I gasped, stumbling backwards into the towel rack.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing in my mom‚Äôs bathroom? Who are you?‚Äù, I shrieked.

His eyes filled with panic, and he seemed like he was trying to speak to me but I couldn‚Äôt make out any words.

I could feel my heart racing like I was in my own scary movie, and then I remembered what my mom said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the police!‚Äù, I yelled, running to my mom‚Äôs phone plugged in on her nightstand.

I picked up the phone and quickly dialed 9-1-1.

‚Äú911, what is your emergency?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a man in my house‚Ä¶ He looks scary, and I don‚Äôt know him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay sweetie, are you home alone?‚Äù, the voice asked, and I heard typing in the background.

‚ÄúNo, my mom is on the couch sleeping. We were watching a scary movie but she had wine and she said that makes her sleep more.‚Äù, I responded.

‚ÄúOkay, police are on the way to you, how old are you?‚Äù, the lady asked me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm 8..‚Äù, I cried softly, I could hear the chains rattling against the glass shower door in the bathroom.

‚ÄúSweetie don‚Äôt cry, I‚Äôm going to stay with you, can you find somewhere to hide? Stay on the phone with m-‚Äú

The cell phone was snatched out of my hands, and in a blur I saw it smash into the wall.

I covered my face with my hands, waiting for the scary man from the shower to grab me and do the same.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing, my love?‚Äù, a familiar voice asked me.

I slowly moved my hands, and my mother stood before me, her head tilted slightly waiting for my answer.

‚ÄúMommy.. There‚Äôs a man in your bathroom, he looks scary like the guy in the movie. I didn‚Äôt want him to hurt you!‚Äù, I began to openly cry, big sobs that shook my small shoulders.

‚ÄúOh, my baby..‚Äù, my mom cooed, wrapping both arms around me.

‚ÄúIs the man gone? I called the police.. Like you said..‚Äù, I started to explain, and through our embrace I felt her stiffen.

‚ÄúDid you tell them where we lived?‚Äù, she asked calmly.

I shook my head into her pajamas, I sensed her relax.

‚ÄúWhat did you tell them?‚Äù, she asked.

‚ÄúI told them there was a scary man in our house, and you fell asleep when we were watching our scary movie..‚Äù, I told her.

She laughed softly, kissing my head.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs perfect, they will just think it‚Äôs a prank or a sugar-high kid. Good job, my baby.‚Äù, she said into my hair.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Mom? There is a man in your shower, and he‚Äôs scary!‚Äù, I cried.

‚ÄúOh he isn‚Äôt scary.. You just weren‚Äôt properly introduced‚Ä¶‚Äù, she said, softly leading me to back to the bathroom. The sounds of rattling chains growing louder as we moved closer.

When we got back to the bathroom, my mom left me by the door and stepped towards the shower. When her gaze fell on the man, her eyes lit up in a dreamlike way.

‚ÄúHoney‚Ä¶ Meet Tim, he‚Äôs going to be your new Daddy.‚Äù, she said with a joyful expression.

‚ÄúT-Tim? Your boyfriend?‚Äù, I asked.

The man‚Äôs face contorted in pain as my mom took a closer step to him, she reached up her hand and softly stroked his face.

‚ÄúOf course, we‚Äôve been seeing each other for months now. We eat lunch together every day, and we have amazing conversations, he‚Äôs a great listener. I wasn‚Äôt expecting you to meet like this, but he‚Äôs lasted so much longer than the others. I knew he was a keeper.‚Äù, she smiles fondly at him, and looks at me.

Others? Were there other men in my house?

‚ÄúCome say hello..‚Äù, she said sweetly.

I shook my head, and took a step back.

‚ÄúN-No. Mom, I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù, I whimpered.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be. We are going to be a family now. The three of us, just like you always wanted, my baby.‚Äù, she told me, reaching out her hand.

I still didn‚Äôt move.

The man‚Äôs eyes were locked on me, a pleading expression filled his face.

Her face grew a puzzled expression as she crossed the room to me, and knelt down to look me in the eye.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand, this is what you wanted. You should be happy.‚Äù, she said flatly, grabbing my arm and holding it a little too tight.

‚ÄúMom, stop. That hurts.‚Äù, I whimpered.

Her grip didn‚Äôt stop as she looked at me expectantly.

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶‚Äù, I whimpered.

Just then, a loud banging sounded across the house, and the doorbell started to ring.

All three of our heads snapped toward the sound.

‚ÄúI thought you didn‚Äôt tell them where we lived‚Ä¶‚Äù, my mother said coldly, turning back to look at me.

Her grip grew tighter and tighter, I saw my arm turn white under her grasp.

‚ÄúMommy! Stop! I didn‚Äôt tell them!!‚Äù, I cried out.

‚ÄúPOLICE, OPEN UP!‚Äù, a booming voice sounded through the walls.

The loud voice distracted my mother long enough for me to bite down on her hand, which finally released me as I ran to the front door.

My mom screamed in pain and began to chase me.

‚ÄúDO NOT OPEN THAT DOOR!‚Äù, she shrieked.

Just as we reached the foyer, the door bursted open. Two police officers stormed in but stopped when they saw me and my mom.

‚ÄúWe got a call about an intruder, and a child potentially in danger.‚Äù, the male cop stated.

‚ÄúOh..‚Äù, my mom laughed weakly, ‚ÄúJust an overactive imagination, I‚Äôm sorry for the trouble. It‚Äôs my fault for agreeing to a scary movie!‚Äù.

She tried to laugh loudly, but it sounded flat.

The male cop‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change.

‚ÄúWhy did we get a report about a man in your house then?‚Äù, he asked my mom.

‚ÄúWell.. My boyfriend is over, and I think that‚Äôs what it is.. They hadn‚Äôt met yet, so, a little embarrassing for me.. But not a stranger!‚Äù, she clarified, wrapping her arms around herself tightly.

‚ÄúUh-huh.. Well let me clear this up and speak to your boyfriend, and we will be on our way.‚Äù, he told her.

‚ÄúNo! I mean, no, he‚Äôs in the shower. Probably won‚Äôt be out for a while, but you have my word.‚Äù, she stammered, wiping her hands on her pants.

‚ÄúWe can wait, it‚Äôs no trouble.‚Äù, the cop challenged.

The other cop was a female, and she knelt down to me with a nice smile.

‚ÄúHey kiddo, you said the man was scary, did you see the scary man on tv? Or was he in your house?‚Äù, she asked me.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in our house..‚Äù, I whispered.

‚ÄúMhm, and what about him is scary?‚Äù, she asked gently.

‚ÄúHe had bruises and scrapes all over him, and his mouth has tape over it.. Mom is right though, she said he‚Äôs her boyfriend..‚Äù, I answered, looking at my feet.

The room was silent for a moment.

The first one to talk was my mom, who laughed.

‚ÄúOh honey! Oh, this is a misunderstanding. The man has a bruise and it‚Äôs now a huge deal. I promise he‚Äôs fine!‚Äù, she said quickly, her voice growing in volume.

‚ÄúBe that as it may, we are still going to talk to him.. This way?‚Äù, the female officer asked, gesturing towards the hallway.

It was silent again for a beat, before my mom exploded.

She began to shriek, and lunged at the female officer. She reached her hands up, trying to scratch her face.

She knocked the female officer over and climbed on top of her screaming.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have him! You can‚Äôt take him from me!‚Äù, she shrieked, trying to put her hands around the officer‚Äôs neck while the male officer was trying to pull her off by her shoulders.

As I watched my mom get slammed to the ground and handcuffed, I felt my heart break. This wasn‚Äôt my mom, she was doing so good lately, we were going to be a happy family! She promised!

More police officers showed up, and another female cop sat next to me while they went through our house.

A few minutes after they arrived, the man from the shower was wheeled out on a gurney.

We locked eyes for a second, and a single tear just ran down his face.

‚ÄúWe called your aunt, she‚Äôs coming to get you..‚Äù, the officer told me softly.

I nodded, but then remembered.

‚ÄúWhat about the others?‚Äù, I asked.

The officer looked at me with confusion.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, sweetheart?‚Äù, she asked me.

‚ÄúMom said he did better than the others, does that mean there are other men in my house?‚Äù, I asked.

Her face turned white, and she glanced up to a passing officer.

‚ÄúGive me one second, I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù, she said gently, rushing to say something quietly to the first officer who came into the house.

He listened to her before his eyes widened and he looked my way, walking over quickly.

‚ÄúHey kiddo, how are you doing?‚Äù, he asked.

I shrugged.

‚ÄúYeah, I bet. So what did your mom mean by others? Did you ever see any other men in your house?‚Äù, I he asked.

I shook my head.

‚ÄúNo. But she said Tim was here for months, and she‚Äôs been happy for months. So maybe the others were her other boyfriends.‚Äù, I said softly.

The officer nodded.

‚ÄúWas your mom happy a lot?‚Äù, he asked me.

‚ÄúUm.. Sometimes. Sometimes she would be happy for a while, and then sad again. And then happy for a while, then sad again.‚Äù, I explained,

‚ÄúAnd what did she do when she was sad?‚Äù, he asked me.

‚ÄúOh! She said gardening helped soothe her soul because it felt like she could bury her problems.‚Äù, I responded, smiling sadly.

The female officer from before quickly walked away, I heard her asking for people to search the backyard.

The male officer just stared at me, his eyes glassy.

The expression made my stomach hurt.

‚ÄúIs my mom a bad person?‚Äù, I asked him.

He didn‚Äôt answer for a moment, and then he finally responded.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but I know she loves you a lot. Before she left in the car she made me promise I would look after you.‚Äù, he explained.

The tears came again, and the officer wrapped me in a tight hug.

And later, when the bodies were dug up from the yard, and the trials began and went for a long time.. I was starting to realize I would never see my mother again.

But I heard my aunt whispering into the phone about the last day of my mom‚Äôs trial.

As she was found guilty of 6 murders, they asked her why she did it, they asked her to give a reason to the family‚Äôs affected for closure.

Apparently she nodded, turned towards the courtroom, and said in a clear voice.

‚ÄúBecause we all deserve love, and I promised to never give up.‚Äù",3,1760072942.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Observe, if you will, the peculiar habitat of Homo sapiens nashius, or as he‚Äôs more commonly known as Stuart Nash. 

A solitary creature by nature, He thrives in small urban enclosures, usually a small condominium with an average temperature of quiet desperation. At dawn, he stirs by noon. He begins with what experts have deemed the feeding ritual. 

With remarkable grace, he lifts the lid of a stainless steel trash bin, peering inside as though consulting a close friend. There, among wilted lettuce and fossil remains of takeout containers. He finds sustenance. Watch closely: the hesitation, the selection, the triumphant retrieval of a half-eaten slice of pizza.

To the untrained observer, this might appear to be an act of madness, but Stuart insists on a philosophy he calls it ‚Äú reintegrating with my waste‚Äù, a practice, rooted according to him, in mindfulness and emotional recycling. He claims it keeps him humble. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hide from what you throw away,‚Äù he once told a local reporter, crumbs of enlightenment still on his chin. 

A biologist might classify this as aberrant behavior. Stuart, however, regards it as evolution.

Stuart Nash ate out of the trash, and everyone knew it. The neighbors knew because he did it at noon in daylight in the bathrobe that used to be white. The clerk at the grocery store knew because he asked for paper bags, ‚Äú easier to compost,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, as if ethics soften the smell. Stuart knew, too. Of course, he wasn‚Äôt delusional. He was enlightened. 

‚ÄúSelf-awareness,‚Äù he likes to tell people, ‚Äú it is 90% of self-improvement.‚Äù He never mentioned the other ten. 

Scholars studying the species have noted that Stewart‚Äôs consumption of refuse extends beyond the literal. His condo is a cramped ecosystem of expired yogurt and emotional artifacts. Reveals a deeper instinct, the preservation of decay. Old birthday cards, unpaid bills, and a dry rose from Anna, his former lover who left two years ago, all particularly arranged as part of a shrine to entropy.

‚Äú I‚Äôm not sentimental,‚Äù he insists, ‚Äú I‚Äôm archival.‚Äù 

Observe how he dusts the objects, how he murmurs small eulogies to each one before returning them to their designated piles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not attachment,‚Äù He claims, it is the awareness of attachment. He finds comfort in this distinction.

The locals have grown accustomed to his habits when the garbage truck comes for its Wednesday morning tour, Stuart watches from his window with visible distress. One occasion, he was seen  running after it, waving a banana peel, shouting, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre taking my progress!‚Äù 
A psychologist might say he has ritualized retention behavior, a pathological refusal to let go, masked as enlightenment. Stuart calls ‚Äú emotional sustainability‚Äù 

To the keen observer, it may appear that Stuart Nash cannot release what no longer nourishes him. He keeps eating what‚Äôs already eaten, what‚Äôs already gone, and returning to what has already left. 

Still, there is a certain grace in the way he performs his delusion, a kind of tragic poise that suggests he knows he‚Äôs drowning, but insists the water is meditative. 

‚Äú I don‚Äôt cling,‚Äù he explains one afternoon while treating himself to a moldy sandwich from the bin, ‚Äú I simply revisit.‚Äù

In recent years, Stuart Nash has expanded his territory. Once a solitary scavenger, he now travels widely, enlightening not only himself, but others by sharing words of wisdom on the comforting notion that decay can be spiritual. 

He calls himself a ‚Äú conscious consumption coach.‚Äù Every Tuesday and Thursday, audiences gather in hotel conference rooms and other spaces, they pay an admission fee, and receive complementary compostable notebooks. On stage, Stuart paces barefoot before the projection of the landfill at sunrise. His presentation is always titled ‚Äú Trash into Treasure: the emotional art of recycling.‚Äù  

‚ÄúWe all have waste,‚Äù he tells them, gesturing with an evangelical grace, ‚Äúmemories, relationships, mistakes, don‚Äôt throw them away. Sit with them, taste them again. Let them remind you who you were when you were still raw.‚Äù  
The crowd nods, misty-eyed. A woman scribbles ‚Äútaste again‚Äù in her notebook. 

Between sessions, he gives his interviews to lifestyle magazines; an interview, ‚ÄúThe Conscious Rot,‚Äù remains his most read work. People think growth is letting go,‚Äù he said, ‚Äú but I think it‚Äôs about holding on with awareness you can‚Äôt transcend what you haven‚Äôt digested.‚Äù The interviewer laughed, thinking it was a metaphor, but it wasn‚Äôt. 

After the seminar, he returns home to his apartment, where the air smells faintly of enlightenment and old onion rings. He sits beside the trash can, tired, but fulfilled, ‚Äú making a difference,‚Äù he quietly utters before taking a bite of yesterday‚Äôs lasagna, the crowd's applause still ringing in his ears. 
 
Field researchers have observed that Homo sapiens nashius occasionally attempts reunion with former mates' behavior. Scientists coined ‚Äú sentimental foraging‚Äù to describe the subject, believing himself involved in ventures back into old emotional territories to scavvage for meaning. 

Two years after her migration, Anna agrees to meet Stewart for coffee. He arrives early, clutching a reusable cup and a speech about forgiveness. 
She looks mostly the same, warmer skin, colder eyes, the faint smell of a life that moved on. 

‚ÄúYou look well‚Äù, he says, a phrase that in his dialect means I‚Äôve been thinking about you while eating, our memories.  

Anna smiles politely. ‚ÄúAre you still‚Ä¶doing the thing?‚Äù 

‚ÄúReintegrating?‚Äù he corrects, delighted she remembers, ‚Äú of course, it‚Äôs who I am now.‚Äù 

She nods slowly, ‚Äú I remember when he was just a phase.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGrowth never expires‚Äù, he replies, stirring his tea with philosophical precision, ‚Äú you have to be willing to restaste the past until it‚Äôs fully digested.‚Äù 

For a moment, she looks at him the way one looks at a stranger, wearing an old friend's clothes. 

‚Äú Stuart,‚Äù she says finally, ‚Äú not everything that goes bad can be recycled.‚Äù 

He laughed as though she told a joke, but her eyes didn‚Äôt change shape. 
When she leaves, he pockets her half-finished muffin, whispering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for closure.‚Äù 

Later that night, he said in his kitchen, it‚Äôs gone still, of course, but he eats it anyway, softly mummering, ‚Äú still sweet.‚Äù 

In the aftermath of reuniting with Anna, field researchers noted a change in the subject‚Äôs behavior. The feeding rituals became more frequent, the lectures more grandiose. What had once been an active reflection now carried the urgency of performance.
 Stuart Nash had begun to mistake audience for validation and applause for absolution.

He decided his next event would be an intimate demonstration of his practice in action. Invitations were sent on recycled paper that smelled faintly of vinegar and ideology. The gathering was to be called the ‚Äúbanquet of becoming.‚Äù 

His condominium, lit by a string of mismatch bulbs, had been transformed into a temple of reclamation. The dining table was long, and it was set with chipped porcelain and wilted centerpieces; the menu was sourced entirely from his trash. ‚ÄúA full circle dining experience.‚Äù The invitations had promised. 

‚Äú We dine tonight,‚Äù he announced, ‚Äú not to indulge, but to transcend.‚Äù 

The guests were old clients' curious neighbors, and one journalist shifted down easily in their folding chairs. A woman whispered that she thought it was a metaphor. 

‚ÄúThere are no metaphors here,‚Äù Stuart said gently as if correcting a child. ‚ÄúThis is nourishment reborn.‚Äù 

He raised a glass of what might have once been lemonade ‚Äú to digestion,‚Äù he declared, ‚Äú to the courage to taste what we‚Äôve discarded.‚Äù 

The guest hesitated; one man laughed nervously enough, with a polite grin, he took a sip and coughed. Stuart smiled radiantly. ‚ÄúUnpleasantness,‚Äù he said is ‚Äúis merely honesty on the tongue.‚Äù 

When someone asked if this was safe, he replied, ‚ÄúGrowth never is.‚Äù 
And as the evening groaned on, the guests began to excuse themselves first in singles and then pairs, one guest said something about something about ‚Äú food poisoning,‚Äù and another dropped her napkin as if discarding participation itself. 

Soon, Stuart remained the last man standing. The table for him was a battlefield of half-touch plates and fallen petals. He looked around at the empty chairs, the smears of sauce, the candle suffocating in the draft. For a moment, his smile faltered. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just not ready‚Äù, he muttered. ‚ÄúNot evolved enough to see the beauty in waste.‚Äù 

He took one final bite of something identifiable, chewed thoughtfully, and whispered, 
‚Äústill sweet.‚Äù 

The banquet was a disaster, but not in the way Stuart feared. 

The reporter who had stayed until the end and an unpaid freelancer named Mercury Marks filed a piece for a small magazine; he titled it ‚ÄúThe Man Who Eats His Mistakes.‚Äù The editor almost killed it until she saw the photos of Stewart and his threadbare bathrobe lifting a fork, full of rot, as if it were a revelation. 

The article went national within days, and the New York Times called him ‚Äú a philosopher of personal decay,‚Äù morning shows debated whether he was a visionary or a cry for help. Street vendors started selling T-shirts that said ‚ÄúTaste again‚Äù 
Stuart was thrilled, ‚Äú finally,‚Äù he said in an interview, ‚Äú people are digesting the message.‚Äù 

He didn‚Äôt mind the tone of the coverage. The smirks, the late-night monologues, the carefully framed digested mockery he told one journalist, ‚Äú is simply curiosity, dressed as fear.‚Äù 
Soon, corporate wellness conferences requested him as a key speaker. He appeared barefoot on a glossy stage, a single trash can beside him, talking about ‚Äúthe courage to re-consume failures.‚Äù The audience laughed in all the right places, mistaking discomfort for insight. 

‚ÄúWe are all compost‚Äù, he proclaimed, holding up a slice of spoiled cake, as if it were communion. 

Flashbulbs went off, and somewhere in the audience, a publicist wept. 

He took a bite and said, ‚ÄúStill sweet.‚Äù 

And so we return to the peculiar habitat of Homo sapiens nashius. Once again, we find Stuart Nash in his natural environment, a modest condominium, somewhere between enlightenment,  his hair is thinner now, his smile wider though it had been stretched by years of explaining himself. 

The world outside has moved on, the articles and the flashbulbs faded, and the applause had gone quiet. But Stuart persevered, ever faithful to his practice. 

With seasoned reverence, he lifts the lid of the trash bin inside yesterday's lasagna, a bruised pear, the remains of a conference badge. He studies them like relics, then slowly he takes a bite. 

To the untrained observer, this might appear to be madness, but Stuart Nash would tell you it‚Äôs a philosophy. He believes the waste, when properly appreciated, is life, repeating itself with self-awareness. 

Outside, the garbage truck rumbles down the street. He doesn‚Äôt look up. 

Stuart Nash ate out of the trash, and everyone knew it 

The neighbors knew because they could smell the enlightenment of the clerk at the grocery store. After all, he always asked for a paper bag, ‚Äúeasier to compost,‚Äù he‚Äôd say as if ethics is softened into the stench, and Stuart knew, of course, he wasn‚Äôt delusional.

 He was enlightened.

1o2s4mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o2s4mk/lonely/,Lonely.,"My mother was a lonely woman.

She wasn‚Äôt perpetually sad. She didn‚Äôt drag around the house in the same pajamas for days on end, I didn‚Äôt see any tears day-to-day.

But sometimes at night I could hear her crying in her room.

I could hear her whispering pleas to God, asking for a man.

When she was sad, she worked in our garden a lot. We had fresh flowers, vegetables, even pumpkins sometimes.

I would help her too, and I had asked her why she liked to garden. She said it was therapeutic, like she could get in the dirt and bury all her problems and bad feelings away. Then they become something beautiful.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for the soul.‚Äù, she would say with a sad smile.

My dad wasn‚Äôt in the picture from even before I was born, and I think Mom was worried about me not having a strong male figure in my life. That it would stunt my emotional growth, or cause me to have issues later on in relationships.

My mom was pretty too, especially when I was younger. I would see the other moms give her a narrow stare when she came to get me from school, and how the dads would offer to come over to ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything at the house we needed.

My mom would always smile politely and say no thank you, but that didn‚Äôt stop the moms from their jealousy.

I knew she would go on dates. She would tell me when she would. She was always happy for a while after the date, and then one day she would be sad again. When I would ask about it, she would just say the same thing.

‚ÄúSometimes things don‚Äôt work out, but we all deserve love. I promise I won‚Äôt ever give up on love.‚Äù

I would wish that she could meet a nice guy who maybe worked at a toy store, or an ice cream shop. Then they could get married and I would make out like a bandit. But as the years went on, no new guy seemed to stick around.

When I was about 8, the crying at night stopped again.

She had been on a date the night before, and I had a sitter from the neighborhood watching me. When I woke up the next morning, mom was smiling and humming in the kitchen.

‚ÄúAre you making pancakes?‚Äù, I asked excitedly. 

When she turned to me, she looked like she was glowing from the inside out.

‚ÄúYes I am, do you want chocolate chips?‚Äù, she asked me, pouring a spoonful of batter onto the hot skillet.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù, I cheered, pulling out my chair at our kitchen table.

When we were eating, I asked her if her date was fun.

She took a small sip of her coffee, and smiled into the mug.

‚ÄúIt was so fun, we talked all about you. He was also a gentleman and made sure I made it home safe. That‚Äôs very important.‚Äù, she responded, stars dancing in her eyes.

‚ÄúIs he nice? Can I meet him? Does he own a toy store? Does he have a dog? I want a dog! Does he-‚Äú

‚ÄúWoah, woah!‚Äù, my mom interrupted me laughing, ‚ÄúMaybe all that sugar was a bad idea! He is very nice, and I‚Äôm sure you can meet him soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow soon?‚Äù, I asked, eyes wide.

She seemed to choose her words carefully.

‚ÄúI suppose whenever the time is right.‚Äù, she answered, passing the maple syrup to me.

I was ecstatic. My mom looked so happy, and I thought that maybe if I met him, he would want to marry my mom and live with us!

The crying at night stopped immediately, but was replaced with low voices talking. A man and a woman.

I couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying, but it sounded like the woman was upset.

The next morning, I asked her who she was talking to the night before in her room.

‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù, she asked, pouring her coffee from the pot.

‚ÄúI heard a man in your room, it sounded like you were mad.‚Äù, I clarified.

She snorted and shook her head.

‚ÄúNo honey, that‚Äôs my audiobook. My doctor said listening to them before going to sleep would help me relax. I even listen to them when I take baths sometimes, they‚Äôre very soothing. Remember when we went to check them out at the library together?‚Äù, she asked me.

I did remember, she got a few different sets and they were in hard cases. 

‚ÄúOh, okay. Did they help?‚Äù, I asked her.

She nodded.

‚ÄúI think so, I‚Äôve never slept better.‚Äù, she said with a smile.

The next few nights, the voices in her room continued, but they seemed quieter. Like she turned the volume lower so she wouldn‚Äôt disturb me again.

Several weeks went by, and every morning she would glow. She would make the best breakfasts, every night was movie night, and I knew it was because of her new boyfriend.

As far as I knew though, she hadn‚Äôt seen him again in person besides their first date.

‚ÄúDo you talk on the phone with him?‚Äù, I asked her.

She laughed softly.

‚ÄúYes, we talk frequently, why do you ask?‚Äù, she responded, turning towards me.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt gone out at night again, the babysitter hasn‚Äôt come back.‚Äù, I explained.

‚ÄúAhhhh, I see. I do see him when you‚Äôre at school. We like to eat lunch together, which is easy for me since I work from home.‚Äù, she explained, smiling warmly at me.

‚ÄúWhen can I meet him?‚Äù, I asked her.

‚ÄúSoon, baby. Hopefully soon. I know he will just love you.‚Äù, she told me, pulling me into a hug.

‚ÄúCan I know his name?‚Äù, I said into her shirt.

‚ÄúTim, his name is Tim.‚Äù, she responded.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I was getting everything I never thought I would have. I began to dream of family road trips, matching Halloween costumes, Christmas morning. Even though I didn‚Äôt have a clear vision of his face yet, I knew he would be handsome and kind. Exactly what my mom needed.

I just had to be patient.

A few weeks later, mom let me pick a scary movie to watch for our movie night. She warned me that it would keep me up all night, but I assured her I wasn‚Äôt scared. She reluctantly sighed and put it on, settling into the couch with a glass of red wine.

In the opening scene, there was a scary man in the house, and the teenage girl screamed and just backed up into a corner.

‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt she call the police?‚Äù, I asked my mom.

My mom snorted.

‚ÄúIn real life she would, but this is a movie so it‚Äôs all pretend.‚Äù, she explained.

30 minutes later, I was holding a pillow in front of my face, shaking at the terrifying man that filled our screen.

‚ÄúOkay, Mom you were right. I‚Äôm scared..‚Äù, I whimpered. When I turned towards her, I saw she was fast asleep on the couch beside me, snoring softly. Her now empty wine glass still in her hand.

I flicked the tv off, cloaking the room in darkness, before covering her with a blanket and moving the glass to the coffee table.

‚ÄúGoodnight, I love you.‚Äù, I whispered, kissing her cheek.

I went to my room and tucked myself into my bed, nightlight on its brightest setting, but I was restless.

I tossed and turned, imagining my jacket hanging over my chair as a monster crouched low.

The curtains became a billowing ghost.

The hum from the heater sounded like a growl.

I sat up, sweating.

I put my hands over my eyes, and sighed deeply.

Then I remembered my mother‚Äôs audiobooks, and how the dull conversations did sound soothing.

I was sure she wouldn‚Äôt mind if I borrowed some for the night, since she was sleeping so soundly in the living room.

I leapt from my bed, and walked carefully down the hall to her room, quietly clicking the door open so I wouldn‚Äôt wake her up.

Her room had a soft glow, as she left her lamp on next to the bed.

I reached her nightstand, looking for the small tape player she thrifted a few years ago, but it was nowhere to be seen.

‚ÄúWhere is it..‚Äù, I whispered, gently moving books and jewelry boxes around her room looking for the black box.

‚ÄúMaybe she left it in the bathroom..?‚Äù, I pondered out loud, opening the door to the wide space and flicking on the light.

And I wasn‚Äôt prepared for what I saw.

Some nights, it‚Äôs all I can see.

A grown man stood in the shower wearing a pair of what seemed to be basketball shorts, with chains around his ankles and wrists. Bruises crowded his face and visible body, and deep cuts ranging from fresh to mostly healed.

When I flicked the light on, he jolted, and his gaze snapped up to me. His eyes were filled with hate, venom. To this day, no one has ever looked at me with such disdain.

I was waiting for him to scream, or yell curse words at me, but I only heard muffled sounds.

I realized his mouth was duct taped.

I gasped, stumbling backwards into the towel rack.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing in my mom‚Äôs bathroom? Who are you?‚Äù, I shrieked.

His eyes filled with panic, and he seemed like he was trying to speak to me but I couldn‚Äôt make out any words.

I could feel my heart racing like I was in my own scary movie, and then I remembered what my mom said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the police!‚Äù, I yelled, running to my mom‚Äôs phone plugged in on her nightstand.

I picked up the phone and quickly dialed 9-1-1.

‚Äú911, what is your emergency?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a man in my house‚Ä¶ He looks scary, and I don‚Äôt know him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay sweetie, are you home alone?‚Äù, the voice asked, and I heard typing in the background.

‚ÄúNo, my mom is on the couch sleeping. We were watching a scary movie but she had wine and she said that makes her sleep more.‚Äù, I responded.

‚ÄúOkay, police are on the way to you, how old are you?‚Äù, the lady asked me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm 8..‚Äù, I cried softly, I could hear the chains rattling against the glass shower door in the bathroom.

‚ÄúSweetie don‚Äôt cry, I‚Äôm going to stay with you, can you find somewhere to hide? Stay on the phone with m-‚Äú

The cell phone was snatched out of my hands, and in a blur I saw it smash into the wall.

I covered my face with my hands, waiting for the scary man from the shower to grab me and do the same.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing, my love?‚Äù, a familiar voice asked me.

I slowly moved my hands, and my mother stood before me, her head tilted slightly waiting for my answer.

‚ÄúMommy.. There‚Äôs a man in your bathroom, he looks scary like the guy in the movie. I didn‚Äôt want him to hurt you!‚Äù, I began to openly cry, big sobs that shook my small shoulders.

‚ÄúOh, my baby..‚Äù, my mom cooed, wrapping both arms around me.

‚ÄúIs the man gone? I called the police.. Like you said..‚Äù, I started to explain, and through our embrace I felt her stiffen.

‚ÄúDid you tell them where we lived?‚Äù, she asked calmly.

I shook my head into her pajamas, I sensed her relax.

‚ÄúWhat did you tell them?‚Äù, she asked.

‚ÄúI told them there was a scary man in our house, and you fell asleep when we were watching our scary movie..‚Äù, I told her.

She laughed softly, kissing my head.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs perfect, they will just think it‚Äôs a prank or a sugar-high kid. Good job, my baby.‚Äù, she said into my hair.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Mom? There is a man in your shower, and he‚Äôs scary!‚Äù, I cried.

‚ÄúOh he isn‚Äôt scary.. You just weren‚Äôt properly introduced‚Ä¶‚Äù, she said, softly leading me to back to the bathroom. The sounds of rattling chains growing louder as we moved closer.

When we got back to the bathroom, my mom left me by the door and stepped towards the shower. When her gaze fell on the man, her eyes lit up in a dreamlike way.

‚ÄúHoney‚Ä¶ Meet Tim, he‚Äôs going to be your new Daddy.‚Äù, she said with a joyful expression.

‚ÄúT-Tim? Your boyfriend?‚Äù, I asked.

The man‚Äôs face contorted in pain as my mom took a closer step to him, she reached up her hand and softly stroked his face.

‚ÄúOf course, we‚Äôve been seeing each other for months now. We eat lunch together every day, and we have amazing conversations, he‚Äôs a great listener. I wasn‚Äôt expecting you to meet like this, but he‚Äôs lasted so much longer than the others. I knew he was a keeper.‚Äù, she smiles fondly at him, and looks at me.

Others? Were there other men in my house?

‚ÄúCome say hello..‚Äù, she said sweetly.

I shook my head, and took a step back.

‚ÄúN-No. Mom, I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù, I whimpered.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be. We are going to be a family now. The three of us, just like you always wanted, my baby.‚Äù, she told me, reaching out her hand.

I still didn‚Äôt move.

The man‚Äôs eyes were locked on me, a pleading expression filled his face.

Her face grew a puzzled expression as she crossed the room to me, and knelt down to look me in the eye.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand, this is what you wanted. You should be happy.‚Äù, she said flatly, grabbing my arm and holding it a little too tight.

‚ÄúMom, stop. That hurts.‚Äù, I whimpered.

Her grip didn‚Äôt stop as she looked at me expectantly.

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶‚Äù, I whimpered.

Just then, a loud banging sounded across the house, and the doorbell started to ring.

All three of our heads snapped toward the sound.

‚ÄúI thought you didn‚Äôt tell them where we lived‚Ä¶‚Äù, my mother said coldly, turning back to look at me.

Her grip grew tighter and tighter, I saw my arm turn white under her grasp.

‚ÄúMommy! Stop! I didn‚Äôt tell them!!‚Äù, I cried out.

‚ÄúPOLICE, OPEN UP!‚Äù, a booming voice sounded through the walls.

The loud voice distracted my mother long enough for me to bite down on her hand, which finally released me as I ran to the front door.

My mom screamed in pain and began to chase me.

‚ÄúDO NOT OPEN THAT DOOR!‚Äù, she shrieked.

Just as we reached the foyer, the door bursted open. Two police officers stormed in but stopped when they saw me and my mom.

‚ÄúWe got a call about an intruder, and a child potentially in danger.‚Äù, the male cop stated.

‚ÄúOh..‚Äù, my mom laughed weakly, ‚ÄúJust an overactive imagination, I‚Äôm sorry for the trouble. It‚Äôs my fault for agreeing to a scary movie!‚Äù.

She tried to laugh loudly, but it sounded flat.

The male cop‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change.

‚ÄúWhy did we get a report about a man in your house then?‚Äù, he asked my mom.

‚ÄúWell.. My boyfriend is over, and I think that‚Äôs what it is.. They hadn‚Äôt met yet, so, a little embarrassing for me.. But not a stranger!‚Äù, she clarified, wrapping her arms around herself tightly.

‚ÄúUh-huh.. Well let me clear this up and speak to your boyfriend, and we will be on our way.‚Äù, he told her.

‚ÄúNo! I mean, no, he‚Äôs in the shower. Probably won‚Äôt be out for a while, but you have my word.‚Äù, she stammered, wiping her hands on her pants.

‚ÄúWe can wait, it‚Äôs no trouble.‚Äù, the cop challenged.

The other cop was a female, and she knelt down to me with a nice smile.

‚ÄúHey kiddo, you said the man was scary, did you see the scary man on tv? Or was he in your house?‚Äù, she asked me.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in our house..‚Äù, I whispered.

‚ÄúMhm, and what about him is scary?‚Äù, she asked gently.

‚ÄúHe had bruises and scrapes all over him, and his mouth has tape over it.. Mom is right though, she said he‚Äôs her boyfriend..‚Äù, I answered, looking at my feet.

The room was silent for a moment.

The first one to talk was my mom, who laughed.

‚ÄúOh honey! Oh, this is a misunderstanding. The man has a bruise and it‚Äôs now a huge deal. I promise he‚Äôs fine!‚Äù, she said quickly, her voice growing in volume.

‚ÄúBe that as it may, we are still going to talk to him.. This way?‚Äù, the female officer asked, gesturing towards the hallway.

It was silent again for a beat, before my mom exploded.

She began to shriek, and lunged at the female officer. She reached her hands up, trying to scratch her face.

She knocked the female officer over and climbed on top of her screaming.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have him! You can‚Äôt take him from me!‚Äù, she shrieked, trying to put her hands around the officer‚Äôs neck while the male officer was trying to pull her off by her shoulders.

As I watched my mom get slammed to the ground and handcuffed, I felt my heart break. This wasn‚Äôt my mom, she was doing so good lately, we were going to be a happy family! She promised!

More police officers showed up, and another female cop sat next to me while they went through our house.

A few minutes after they arrived, the man from the shower was wheeled out on a gurney.

We locked eyes for a second, and a single tear just ran down his face.

‚ÄúWe called your aunt, she‚Äôs coming to get you..‚Äù, the officer told me softly.

I nodded, but then remembered.

‚ÄúWhat about the others?‚Äù, I asked.

The officer looked at me with confusion.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, sweetheart?‚Äù, she asked me.

‚ÄúMom said he did better than the others, does that mean there are other men in my house?‚Äù, I asked.

Her face turned white, and she glanced up to a passing officer.

‚ÄúGive me one second, I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù, she said gently, rushing to say something quietly to the first officer who came into the house.

He listened to her before his eyes widened and he looked my way, walking over quickly.

‚ÄúHey kiddo, how are you doing?‚Äù, he asked.

I shrugged.

‚ÄúYeah, I bet. So what did your mom mean by others? Did you ever see any other men in your house?‚Äù, I he asked.

I shook my head.

‚ÄúNo. But she said Tim was here for months, and she‚Äôs been happy for months. So maybe the others were her other boyfriends.‚Äù, I said softly.

The officer nodded.

‚ÄúWas your mom happy a lot?‚Äù, he asked me.

‚ÄúUm.. Sometimes. Sometimes she would be happy for a while, and then sad again. And then happy for a while, then sad again.‚Äù, I explained,

‚ÄúAnd what did she do when she was sad?‚Äù, he asked me.

‚ÄúOh! She said gardening helped soothe her soul because it felt like she could bury her problems.‚Äù, I responded, smiling sadly.

The female officer from before quickly walked away, I heard her asking for people to search the backyard.

The male officer just stared at me, his eyes glassy.

The expression made my stomach hurt.

‚ÄúIs my mom a bad person?‚Äù, I asked him.

He didn‚Äôt answer for a moment, and then he finally responded.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but I know she loves you a lot. Before she left in the car she made me promise I would look after you.‚Äù, he explained.

The tears came again, and the officer wrapped me in a tight hug.

And later, when the bodies were dug up from the yard, and the trials began and went for a long time.. I was starting to realize I would never see my mother again.

But I heard my aunt whispering into the phone about the last day of my mom‚Äôs trial.

As she was found guilty of 6 murders, they asked her why she did it, they asked her to give a reason to the family‚Äôs affected for closure.

Apparently she nodded, turned towards the courtroom, and said in a clear voice.

‚ÄúBecause we all deserve love, and I promised to never give up.‚Äù

It‚Äôs so stressful because our lab is great otherwise!

Known as the ‚ÄúLittle Vienna,‚Äù this baroque city blends history, music, green spaces, and a relaxed lifestyle in a compact and walkable center.

https://preview.redd.it/3eec8d6mxuqf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8c46c025ec4227ec0e40783fa4ca16c80f649ff

The heart of Vara≈ædin is its **Old Town fortress (Stari grad)**, a 14th‚Äëcentury stronghold expanded through Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. Today it houses the **Vara≈ædin City Museum**, which spreads across multiple palaces. Inside the fortress you‚Äôll find arms, guild collections, and portraits, while the **Sermage Palace** displays Old Masters and Croatian art, and the **Herzer Palace** is famous for the family‚Äëfriendly **World of Insects** exhibition.

The cityscape is shaped by ornate palaces, churches, and squares. The **Vara≈ædin Cathedral**, built by Jesuits in the 17th century, is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and hosts concerts during the city‚Äôs festivals. The **Korzo** (main square) and **Stanƒçiƒá Square** buzz with caf√©s, galleries, and outdoor seating, while the **Croatian National Theatre Vara≈ædin** stages plays and concerts in a 19th‚Äëcentury landmark.

One of Vara≈ædin‚Äôs most unique highlights is its **cemetery**, redesigned in 1905 by Herman Haller. With more than 7,000 trees shaped into symmetrical alleys, it is as much a park as a resting place and often listed among Europe‚Äôs most beautiful cemeteries.

Festivals give Vara≈ædin its cultural edge. Every late August, the **≈†pancirfest** street festival fills the Old Town with musicians, performers, artisans, and food stalls. In September, the **Vara≈ædin Baroque Evenings** bring international early‚Äëmusic ensembles to churches and palaces, continuing a tradition started in 1971.

Food and drink are another reason to linger. Don‚Äôt miss the **Vara≈ædinski klipiƒç**, a golden bread roll with EU‚Äëprotected status, or traditional dishes like **Zagorski ≈°trukli**. Pair them with wines from the nearby **Meƒëimurje Wine Road**, where the local **Pu≈°ipel** grape produces crisp whites. Caf√©s around Korzo and Stanƒçiƒá Square serve up strong coffee, cakes, and people‚Äëwatching.

Outdoors, the **Drava river parks** offer cycling, jogging, and quiet walks. Vara≈ædin also lies along the **Amazon of Europe Bike Trail**, a long‚Äëdistance route following the Drava, Mura, and Danube rivers across five countries. Families enjoy riverside playgrounds, while adventurers can kayak the Drava.

Vara≈ædin is also a great base for day trips. **Trako≈°ƒáan Castle** is one of Croatia‚Äôs most famous, set above a lake and forest trails. **Vara≈ædinske Toplice** reveals Roman spa remains at Aquae Iasae. **Ludbreg** claims the title ‚ÄúCentre of the World,‚Äù and the **Krapina Neanderthal Museum** brings prehistoric Europe to life. Wine lovers will find plenty to explore along the rolling vineyards of Meƒëimurje.

Getting here is easy: Vara≈ædin is only about 90 km from Zagreb, under two hours by bus, a bit longer by train, or just over an hour by car on the A4 motorway. Once in town, everything is within walking distance.

Whether you come for its baroque Old Town, world‚Äëclass festivals, food and wine, or castles, Vara≈ædin delivers history and charm in equal measure. It‚Äôs a place where elegance and energy meet‚Äîwell worth adding to any Croatian itinerary.

One day, he offered to teach someone to play mtg. I agreed to this - I'm always looking to make new friends, so I often agree to random activities, watch parties, etc. people offer. We started doing this every week and hit it off extremely well. Like we just clicked and after not long at all the banter flowed so easily between us, we shared our deep feelings and lots of silly in jokes too, we became best friends, it all just fell together. I've never experienced anything like that.

  
Eventually, we decide to meet in person. He flew out to a city near me to see me. I waited in a coffee shop and when I saw him get out of the uber outside the window it was one of the most exciting things ever. We hugged very big and tight. I was worried it might be awkward, but we just flowed right back into our usual banter within minutes. It felt like the most comfortable and natural thing in the world to be around him. We went to a bunch of cool places around town, the museum, the collectible shop to play mtg in person, we got mexican, we went a bunch of places but omg. I grew up homeschooled and isolated and I have all my life watched other people out with friends like that and longed for it, so it was extra meaningful for me. It was even better than I fantasized

  
Not long after this, we began dating. I knew he had feelings for me, but I had a hard time accepting that I did too. I've never been attracted to a man before and I was taken aback by that and kinda scared. Not of him, but just of my own feelings; I didn't know how to process that. I eventually realized I loved him and I couldn't deny our connection and keep myself in this box, that even if it scared me I needed to just go for it. But I'm so happy and he seems to be too; we video call and he looks at me like I'm the most precious thing on earth.

1o2ryhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1o2ryhl/my_dreams_always_come_true/,My dreams always come true.,"I hate myself for it. I watch what happens in my dream occur, and I can‚Äôt do anything about it.

Many times I have dreamed about people dying ‚Äî and I have to watch it happen.  
I pray to dear God that I don‚Äôt dream every night before going to sleep, but I get ignored every time.

There have been some nights when I don‚Äôt dream,  
but then I dream **twice** the next time I sleep.  
And those dreams are always about people passing away.

I try not to sleep when that happens.  
Once I tried keeping myself awake by drinking an almost lethal amount of coffee.  
I dreamed **five times** the next time I slept after that.

I have watched people getting murdered in front of my eyes.  
I have watched animals dying in front of my eyes.  
I have watched people I love dying in front of my eyes.

Just because I dreamed.

I blame myself and hold a knife pointed at my throat,  
just to drop it and start blaming myself again.

It is currently 1 in the morning,  
and I am once again scared to sleep.

One part of my brain wishes not to dream,  
but the other part begs to dream.  
I know what will happen if I don‚Äôt.

I am sitting in my chair with my whole body shaking.  
I must lie on the bed and close my eyes.

I cannot do it.  
I can‚Äôt, but I‚Äî

>

I get up, lie down on the bed, and put pillows all around me.  
I sleep with a knife.  
In a case, obviously, so I don‚Äôt cut myself while sleeping.

It‚Äôs a sharp knife.  
The brand claims it is sharp enough to cut through a rope in just one light swing.  
I never tested it though.  
I keep ropes away from me.  
I get bad thoughts.

>

I close my eyes and I am suddenly lost in thought.  
I think about the time I used to have normal dreams.  
Happy dreams ‚Äî sometimes sad.

>

I think about when it started.  
These dreams.  
Always negative.  
Never positive.

I can‚Äôt remember anything as always.  
I think about nothing for a while.  
I am thinking about something but I feel like I am not.  
I am not.  
I‚Äî

I forgot to tell you.  
These dreams of mine. Are. Always. **Lucid.**

I know I am dreaming right now as one of my fingers is missing.  
An extremely common way to differentiate between reality and dreams ‚Äî  
just see if y‚Äî

I feel dead.  
My eyes lock on my finger.  
My index finger.

It‚Äôs not missing.  
It‚Äôs not missing.  
It‚Äôs not missing‚Äî  
it‚Äôs not there.

>

My mouth is too dry to scream.  
My legs are shaking on their own and I am unconsciously biting my tongue.

My index finger has been cut off.  
No. No. **NO.**

It doesn‚Äôt take me any more time to realize.  
This dream is not about someone else.  
It‚Äôs about **me.**

I cannot move.  
I have my knife with me.  
It is already taken out of its case.

I look around in the void but see my watch.  
The time is **2:55 in the morning.**

The pain of fear beats the pain of my finger.  
Eventually, I start feeling both.

I cut my tongue hard.  
Blood fills my mouth and wets it.  
I scream. I scream‚Äî  
no voice comes out.

I cannot speak.  
I wish the dream is about me accidentally cutting off my finger with my knife.  
Yes. Great.  
It is my left hand anyway.  
It doesn‚Äôt matter at all be‚Äî

A knife.  
Its sharp edge pointed at the top of my head.

I close my eyes.  
A person breathes heavily.

I‚Äôm gonna wake up any second now.  
Any seco‚Äî

But that means something bad will happen.

If my dream ends right now, it will mean that.. I am dead.

I feel the knife lift‚Äî  
but I feel the pain in my throat.

I wake up.  
I am extremely sweaty.  
My clock says it is **2:55 in the morning.**

I get out of my bed.  
I know what is about to happen.

I look at my finger.  
It is not there.

I don‚Äôt try to scream,  
but I eventually do.

The try doesn‚Äôt do anything,  
but I still had to try.

Me screaming would startle the person who is about to take my life.  
Everything goes according to what happened in my dream.

Me biting my tongue,  
blood fills in my mouth.  
My head hurts.

I am thinking what I thought in my dream ‚Äî and this ‚Äî at the same time.

Knife on the top of my head.  
I close my eyes as in my dream.

Same heavy breathing.  
I realize that‚Äôs **me.**

I am too scared.  
I might die from fear.

I don‚Äôt think about waking up.  
This is reality.  
I know it.

The knife lifts up.  
It‚Äôs going to come down with force any second now.

It is going to kill me.  
I am about to die.

Is that a good thing?  
I will never have dreams again.

No more people will die.  
No more animals will die.  
No more accidents will happen.

Because of **me.**

I fall on the ground.  
My knife passed through.

I think for five seconds more ‚Äî  
enough to realize the situation.

I think if everything was a coincidence the whole time,  
or real.

**I see the long hand of the clock move backwards and forward.**

I wake up.

Last year was particularly difficult after my mothers death and also in her and my work place due to immense pressure we both were handling. She was in a new leadership role and felt isolated and didnt know whom to share her stress with as she didnt want to add up to my stress.

She made a friendship with a male colleague who was very easy going and she liked that ease as that allowed her to destress. She kept the friendship from me as she knew i wouldn‚Äôt approve a close friendship with a male colleague as i have always insisted. She has difficulty making friends due to her nature and finds friendship with men easier.

She made ground rules at the starting itself with him telling him that she was only looking for a friendship as she is very happy in her marital life. Also in the first week she asked him twice ‚Äúwe are just friends right‚Äù as she was confused why she felt so good talking to someone. Once she felt safe in the friendship she opened up a lot about our marriage, all the good things and passion we have.

So the friendship deepened and she took the friendship very seriously. Gave him gifts like books and pens. She spoke about our sex life in detail as she felt it was like a guys friendship and she felt like a guy with him. They went out during lunch and sometimes coffee.

But suddenly the colleague reduced talking and once she asked he said he had developed feelings for her. To this she said she didnot feel the safe and loved me too much.

She continued messaging him even though he didnt reply asking him to keep the friendship and get over his feelings and couldn‚Äôt stop msging as she was addicted to the relief she felt from talking to him. I caught her through a message i saw in her phone one day and slowly the hidden and secret friendship came to light.

She has completely cut contact and promises will never even talk to a man other than professionally. She is extremely loving to me but i keep wondering if this was just a friendship or an affair.",3,1760072253.0,emotionalaffair,12,1.0,False

**Hi! Coming to you with a fresh idea of making full-spoiler reviews of every book by my favourite HR author so far, Maggie Osborne (mainly to force myself to read the rest of her books that are still stuck on my TBR). I'm not a native English speaker, so I apologize for mistakes in advance. Hope you'll like it anyways!**

Foxfire Bride was my 2nd book by Maggie Osborne and it immidietly won my interest thanks to the heroine. Fox is a proper tomboy, she lives in a lonely cabin by the lake with an elderly black man, Peaches, who is like a father to her. They live off selling ice from the lake they cut in winter and store in a deep cellar, but this is not how it's always been; Fox used to be a guide who led caravans and travellers through the Rockies, until a gunshot made her settle down. We first meet her in a particularily warm year, during which the lake did not produce enough ice to feed both her and Peaches, as she suddenly gets a proposition to become a guide once again.

Now, I liked her because in all of her tomboyishness she was not a stonecold badass with no emotions nor weaknesses as multiple such characters in media. No, she's actually very insecure, full of anger, ready to burst at any second and extremely expressive. She's also awkward in a funny way, which I found especially amusing, because she reminded me of my autistic self.

For now we're gonna ignore the fact that half of Maggie Osborne's heroines have red hair (the rarest colour) and too many of them share a habit of slapping their hat against their thigh when irritated/unsettled. Fox is simply too precious to criticize her.

Back to the story, the man who wants to hire Fox as a guide is Matthew Tanner, and the first thing we find out about him is that he is *smokin'* hot. He's also a son of an oil magnate, but he works for another oil magnate, named Jennings, and he needs to get to Denver ASAP because his dad was kidnapped by bandits and is now held for ransom. Now that might not make sense to you - why does he care so much for a father he clearly hates, since he joined his rival's company? - and neither it does to Fox, so on their way she tries multiple times to untangle the mess of his family relationships, but this is a mystery to be solved almost at the very end of the book.

Tanner isn't stupid and he brings two hired guns with himself to protect the gold for ransom, Hanratty and Brown. The five of them embark on a journey: Tanner, Hanratty, Brown, Fox and old Peaches who insisted on joining them despite health issues. We later find out that he suffers from tuberculosis and he wanted to make this journey his last before death. As you probably know, the TB is an atomic bomb of emotions in the historical context, so yeah, brace yourselves for some weepy chapters. Osborne is the best when it comes to writing grief and this book is one of its most gut-wrenching examples.

*""Dying's not a dignified process, Missy."" He wouldn't look at her.*

*""What's that mean?""*

*""I soiled myself.""*

*Tears jumped into her eyes. The end was closer than she could stand to believe. ""Hell, Peaches. You wiped my fanny a time or two, guess I can wipe yours. It's not like I haven't seen a man's butt before."" She thought a minute. At least she could do it in privacy. ""I'll set up the tent and find you some fresh pants. You just rest a bit, and I'll take care of things real soon.""*

*""I love you, Missy,"" he said looking up at her.*

*""I know. I love you, too, old man.""*

Basically their journey is a mixture of adventures, suspense, hilarious banter between Fox and Matthew and tragic moments with dying Peaches. The two hired guns, Brown and Hanratty, were given much more depth and nuance than I expected, which was nice. Both still ended up betraying the main party for Tanner's gold, Brown as a heartless scoundrell and Hanratty - filled with doubts, because he developed a soft spot for Fox... and a desire to get between her legs.

Speaking of getting between Fox'es legs, her relationship with Tannes is entertaining from start to finish. At first they try to repress their attraction - especially after Peaches warned Tanner not to break her heart - and then enter a ""strictly physical"" liaison about which the whole group gets immidietly informed. Because Fox is fckin' nuts. Matthew decides to spend a few days courting her, during which we are given a few glorious moments with the hired guns advising him to do it faster because Fox'es temper is getting out of hand. Finally the day comes (and so do they), they meet in a perfectly arranged space, and the reader is surprised with a foreplay using...

FEET!!!!!!!

*He kissed her toes! Fox could not believe it. Her mouth fell open and she stared. This was the most erotic event that had ever happened to her. Who would even think of such a thing? Only Matthew Tanner. She was positive no other man had ever kissed a woman's toes, for God's sake. Holding her breath, hardly daring to move, she waited to see if he would do it again. And he did. He kissed the toes of her other foot and she dropped back on the blanket, blinking at the starry sky and thinking she would surely faint for the first time in her life.*

**facepalm**

As you might have guessed, this is my biggest... and probably the only problem with this book. Who the hell decides to include feet play in a supposedly vanilla sex scene? Maggie Osborne, that's who, and it's not the only time she's done it... I've seen it in two books by far, hope to never see it again.

Anyways, the rest of the sex scene is quite pleasant and so are the other scenes. Well, they're definitely pleasant for Fox and Matthew, because the closer they are getting to Denver, the more they realise, that the upcoming end of their affair will be somewhat difficult to stomach. And now is the time for the real drama to finally unfold.

So, Fox didn't only take this job because she needed money or because she liked being a guide. She did that because she had an unfinished business back east - a revenge on her stepfather who, after the death of her mother, cut her off and turned her, a society lady, into a struggling wild woman we know her as. The mission is certain to end with her on the gallows, but she doesn't care. Matthew does know that, he only doesn't know that her stepfather is Jennings, his employer. As they're nearing Denver, two problems occur: firstly, Peaches' dying wish is for her to give up on her revenge, and secondly, Tanner finds out that the man she wants to kill is Jennings. Time for a shakespearean reveal:

*""My full name is Matthew Tanner Jennings. [...] My mother was Caroline Tanner. When I went to work for Jennings Mining and Mercantile, my father suggested I use Tanner as a last name and I agreed. [...]""*

So yeah, the magnate he worked for and the father held for ransom are the same person, who also happens to be Fox'es demonic stepdad. Which gives us sweet, sweet angst and drama and also this delicious exchange:

*Afterward, they lay in each other's arms, lost in the joy of each other. Then Fox sat up suddenly and grabbed the edge of the blanket, yanking it forward to cover her breasts and bottom.*

*""You're my brother!""*

*The moon illuminated his shock as Tanner also shot upright and stared. ""Good God. You're my sister!""*

Fortunatelly they realised soon enough that this was not the case.

We're nearing the end of the book. From a party of five, only two reach the destination: Peaches died from tuberculosis while Hanratty and Brown died from stupidity, with gunshots as its most severe symptoms. Fox and Matthew part in Denver, only to be reunited in Jennings' office: a final encounter to leave either all three of them dead or all three of them forgiven, together and happy. I'll let you figure out how this one went.

**Conclusion**

I really, really, really liked this book. The heroine was so unique and precious, the hero was so likeable and relatable, the side characters were so fleshed-out, the story, the prose, the setting - nothing was lacking. Even the feet weren't so disturbing, even though I most definitely do not have this kink. I loved how rich the plot was with fight scenes, adventures, natural disasters and distinctive locations; how sweet, steamy, funny and tragic at the same time the main relationship was; how grand the world surrounding the characters felt, and how beautiful. Fox is definitely my favourite Osborne's heroine, even if she's not so original, compared to some of her other books. Tanner did not win my heart this much, but he was still a solid hero.

That's it, I hope you liked my review and see you next time!",3,1760071707.0,HistoricalRomance,5,0.81,False

I have three kids, 2yo 4yo and 7yo. My husband keeps on top of the kids school runs, kids lunches and kids bed time as well as laundry. He also has his own struggles though, as he has Autism with a lot of damage caused by the whole ""hide it, pretend to be like everyone else, just be normal"" that they used to enforce on neurodivergent kids back in the day. I work 5 days a week, often with hours of overtime on top of this. Husband works too, though his shifts are shorter. 

I feel like I am failing my family by not pulling my fair share of the household tasks. My house is a mess, I come home and feel too tired to do much beyond assist with bed times. Rubbish seems to always randomly spawn and I struggle to keep on top of it. Messes caused by the kids, oh look the toddler just dropped a wet nappy and ran to the toilet. Time to hunt the house for any more surprise nappies. I just bought a brand new vacuum which I love and is so easy to use but I can't use it because too much stuff is on the floor. I've been decluttering and throwing things away for months, where is all this coming from. I washed the walls two weeks ago, why have dirty hand prints appeared. 

I am overwhelmed. I've lost the ability to even go into the kitchen and cook dinner. I walk in and just... blank. I'll make a coffee and call that enough. Meat and salad sandwiches for the kids (they seem to love this? I thought kids hated salad). 

At work I am a different person. Smiles, perfectly clean and organised ward, able to kill all staff and patients with kindness all that stuff. I feel so happy there. Same with going outside and working on my food forest with the kids. Why can't I bring even a fraction of this home. I'll lay on the couch and cuddle with my kids. 

I somehow rambled off topic but I feel its all relevant. Yes I have depression, I am taking Pristiq for it. Anxiety is another issue.

I am trying to be more active on reddit as a means to keep myself accountable. Not a hugely involved social group outside of here so I'm keeping the onus of changing my situation on me.

I'm pursuing grad school, got decent/good stats, was excited to go initially anticipating getting a full student loan through federal aid, but after Trump's BBB federal financial aid has been drastically cut. I am in the process of applying and will be actively seeking scholarships as applicable--I will have a much better on actual offers by January.

That said, I work part-time at a coffee shop. Which feels a lil below what I expected of myself at this stage in life, M26. I do also tutor part-time which nets me maybe 300 a month on top of part time pay.

The big initial reason to work coffee house/part time work was the flexibility in studying. Now that my big test is behind me, I am realizing I mostly only have soft skills to offer, and not many hard skills.

**Heres the budgeting aspect I need help with:**

\-I **make 2k/month** give or take

\-Most major payments are paid off and I am living with family

\--This means **my major expenses** are rent and school loans, which **total to $500/month**

\--Factoring in **gas, groceries, and 15% towards savings** thats about another **$500/month**



I have leaks like going out and food but after getting more involved in my grad school planning, I am seeking on cutting this back.

**What are better ways to make money and what can someone with a nontraditional background (no strong college degree/hard skills) do to improve work prospects and skills?**

Not saying it was always bad and no one hates him but there's alot that I have to do to fix this situation. Im sober now and while there was no good excuse for my neglectfulness before I was the main reason it got to the point it is now. I will have my son back but I have to regain his trust and a fee other hurdles to not cause chaos all over again. This is a post in relation to one I deleted due to alot of hate fueled by bad wording and missing info. Its going to work out its just one more thing I have to fix along with maintaining sobriety, my job and my home. Hope this clears things up enough for some of the mass hate I received. If anyone would like to talk about any of it further I will because it helps just inbox me. Im not addicted to my phone but ill reply back eventually. ",1,1760070442.0,Parenting,1,1.0,False

We've been saying for months now that Julia never cared about her wife and only married her for financial reasons and social hierarchy. Julia is an aggressive, desperate social climber that will do just about anything for a sense of relevancy even turning on her friend for a reality tv show and exposing herself for being a serial cheater on a public platform in an attempt to keep her Mojito.

  
Which is obviously nothing new on these shows but it definitely hits a bit harder with her because of her past dating history and how blatantly obvious she is about all of it, and tonights reunion has definitely proven that to be true. Julia is a Haitian mortician loving, coffee maker purchasing, wolf in sheep's clothing.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a tale of tennis turmoil where rankings take a backseat to recent form, cramps play the role of uninvited guest, and Alex de Minaur‚Äîyes, the 7th-ranked Aussie‚Äîfinds himself as the underdog in a match he *should* be favored in. Welcome to the 2025 Shanghai Masters quarterfinals, where logic takes a coffee break and sportsbooks serve up a head-scratcher: **Daniil Medvedev**, the 18th seed, is the favorite over De Minaur despite the latter‚Äôs higher ranking. How? Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a line judge on Red Bull.

### Parse the Odds: When Numbers Lie (But Not Really)

The odds tell a story of a split personality. On paper, De Minaur (-200) is the ‚Äúsensible‚Äù pick, while Medvedev (+250) is the ‚Äúbet on chaos‚Äù option. But hold your horses! Convert those numbers to implied probabilities, and De Minaur‚Äôs 57% chance of winning (per -200 odds) clashes with Medvedev‚Äôs 40% (per +250). Yet, the article insists Medvedev is the favorite. Why? Because hard courts are his *second home*‚Äîhe‚Äôs 7-4 against De Minaur on the surface, including a straight-sets thrashing at the 2024 ATP Finals. Meanwhile, De Minaur‚Äôs recent ‚Äúform‚Äù (read: winning streak) might be a mirage. Medvedev‚Äôs three-set survival against Learner Tien? A gritty ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had worse‚Äù moment compared to De Minaur‚Äôs fresh legs. The market‚Äôs split between ‚Äúrespect the rank‚Äù and ‚Äúhonor the surface‚Äù is as confusing as a tennis fan trying to explain *why* the tiebreak is seven points.

### Digest the News: Cramps, Compliments, and the Curse of the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù

Medvedev‚Äôs recent match against Tien was less a tennis match and more a survival documentary. He limped, he cramped, he even had a medic join the party like a late-arriving guest at a family reunion. Yet, he prevailed‚Äîcalling Tien ‚Äúthe toughest opponent I‚Äôve faced outside the Big Three‚Äù is like saying a cactus is ‚Äúslightly prickly.‚Äù It‚Äôs true, but also a reminder that

Her winning her round was absolute fraudulence. It came down to the judges taste testing the cakes after none of them got the answer right. When they taste tested, the only criticism for the taste of any cake was for hers and they one dude not liking the coffee. Then they said ‚Äúwell hers fooled us the most.‚Äù Well none of you got the answer right, so why is that a factor at all??? If you inspect all of them under a microscope, they all look like cake dude. You still got fooled by all of them, and hers tasted the least good according to you, so why did she win bro?? Not to mention, she literally had the most boring, easiest to make design out of the three. Gummy bears dude?? Get over yourself.

The first week went pretty okay, but I realized that I would benefit from a higher dosage once my body got used to it. 

Surprise, I ended up not going back to get my prescription renewed and years have passed lol But, my daily life has been a struggle. Particularly my energy levels and processing time. I just feel like I can be better at being awake, present, and focused. 

I drink Celsius/Monster/Red Bull fairly regularly. I really only feel more awake with 400mg caffeine throughout the day. I've had many different types of coffee, and it doesn't do anything for me, and I don't get jittery. I average 7-9 hours of sleep every day and I end up being sleepy for the majority of my days. 

I'm a very physically active person and work out regularly. That being said, I'm looking to see what supplements you take that help with ADHD symptoms. I'm considering taking supplements vs prescription, but will go back to rx if that's the overall better choice (and I'll stick to it this time lol). 

I've heard of L-Theanine, Ashwaganda, Lion's Mane, mushroom coffee, etc. I'd like to hear your personal experience with these. Thank you! ",2,1760069982.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
