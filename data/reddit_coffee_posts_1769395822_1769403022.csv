""Is that understood?""

The Dean was lecturing me, and I stared down at my lap, trying to fathom how I had gotten myself into this situation.

Guards stood behind me, as if I were some escaped psychopath.

Every time I shifted, I noticed them snap to attention out of the corner of my eye.

I was supposed to belong here, to find myself.

What I had found was a student body deadly serious about separating students according to the zodiac.

My gaze flicked to an astrology chart on the wall, where the school's least favorite sign had been scribbled out in permanent marker.

The Dean's office was an astrologer’s dream. The Dean herself was my mother’s age, a scowling woman who seemed more shadow than person. 

A projector illuminated constellations across the room, casting her face in eerie white light. 

I had been lazily following Orion across the walls when she finally snapped, and I jerked to attention, my eyes rolling back to her.

""Miss Oliver!""

I nodded, my cheeks burning. 

Orion skimmed across her face, and I found myself mesmerized by how beautiful the star looked.

Her office was fairly cozy, a messy kind of cozy. Books and papers piled around her, empty coffee mugs sat half-forgotten, and star maps were spread across her laptop, their corners stained with coffee.

""It was a mistake,"" I finally said through the lump in my throat.

It wasn’t a mistake.

But it’s not like I could admit that.

For some reason, along with this college’s draconian rules centered around the zodiac of all things, there was one sign in particular that had been outcast.

I turned my attention back to the scribbled-out symbol.

Subtle.

Gemini.

If there was ever a zodiac sign people disliked, it wasn’t Gemini.

I grew up with classmates hating Pisces because no one wanted to be a fish, or Cancer because of the crab. But Gemini?

Gemini was in the summer months, and the constellation, in my opinion, was beautiful.

But not to these guys.

Starting my freshman year, I began to notice how badly Gemini students were treated, especially the guys.

Being a late admission, I was new, along with another kid who, at first, seemed like the class clown. He was friendly enough, introducing himself with a grin.

We were asked for our star signs as an icebreaker, or what I thought was an icebreaker, and he shrugged with a small smile.

""Uh, I think I’m a Gemini?"" he said, sounding unsure, leaning back in his chair.

""Yeah. I was born on June 10th. I’m a Gemini.""

I expected that to be the end of it, but instead I noticed a sudden shift in the air, like he had just confessed to murdering his whole family.

The girl next to him inched away, dragging her laptop with her, while the rest of the class seemed to collectively let out a breath before twisting toward the back of the room.

It was almost robotic, their heads snapping around, eyes narrowing. 

I hadn’t even noticed the four students in the shadows, hunched over their MacBooks. 

The professor’s expression seemed to crumple, his eyes darkening significantly.

""I think…"" He spoke in a sharp breath before seemingly collecting himself. ""You should go join your friends at the back.""

The Gemini kid seemed baffled and a little hurt.

The air was thick, every eye burning into him. I felt like they were looking at me too. The professor's eyes were wide, lips curled, like he might say something. 

But he just shook his head, seemingly gathering himself.

""I'm confused,"" the kid laughed nervously, almost jumping out of his chair when a girl behind him kicked his bag across the floor. He sent her a questioning look.

""Is… is this some kind of joke?""

""Now."" The professor wasn’t even looking at him.

""But…"" The boy tried to laugh. ""It's just a star sign, right?""

""I will not ask you again,"" the professor said stiffly. He didn't move, as if doing so would mean being closer to the boy. 

He folded his arms across his chest. ""If you do not move to your designated seat right now, you're out of my class.""

To my surprise, the boy got up and moved to the back, ignoring students cringing away from him. He didn't speak again, sticking to his assigned group. 

I noticed everyone else had been separated into their zodiac signs.

Leos were at the front, with Sagittarius and Libra surrounding them. The other star signs were harder to make out. 

I thought it was just that class that took the zodiac a little too seriously.

But no.

This thing had spread across campus like a virus.

Students didn't care about their grades or what careers they were going to get. 

Because the star signs at the top of the social hierarchy had the faculty wrapped around their little fingers. 

A Libra girl found out she was no longer compatible with a Scorpio and stopped talking to him.

The entire campus had gone fucking crazy. Including the faculty.

It was only certain star signs that were allowed extra credit and invited into exclusive clubs, while the rest of us were left in the dust. Geminis were either treated like dirt or feared, like they were carrying a contagious disease. 

It was like going back to middle school.

In the sixth grade, I was proud of my star sign. I liked to think I had a secret twin, after learning about the story behind the constellation. Castor and Pollux, twin brothers transformed into Gemini.

I used to draw the twins on the backs of my hands, daydreaming up my very own.

Mina Lucas, a Pisces, called me a two-faced bitch. Because Gemini had two faces. So, I called her an ugly fish.

This was middle school, though.

It's normal for kids to build personalities around star signs.

College students, however, are grown adults.

It was fine to base a crush around a star sign or compatibility. But your whole life? Your social circle and education?

It was bad enough that my classmates were brainwashed by stars, but the professors too? It didn't make sense.

It didn't make sense that my roommate had a mental breakdown the night before because she didn't have anything blue to wear. 

According to her star sign, she had to wear blue to have a good day.

Geminis were either mercilessly bullied by students and professors alike or treated like they were invisible.

I had noticed over the last few days, disgust had turned to fear.

Instead of bullying Geminis, other students steered clear of them.

I saw it contorted on every face, wary of the Gemini sitting near them, and presently, I saw it on my Dean's face.

She was scared of me.

The woman may have seemed in control, but I noticed her finger anxiously tapping on her coffee mug, her gaze flashing to and from the clock on the wall. She was waiting for something, her demeanor tense, eyebrows furrowed.

Every passing minute seemed to unnerve her even more.

""A mistake,"" she repeated my words, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""Yes."" I didn’t look her in the eye, swiping my clammy hands on my jeans.

What was I supposed to say?

I didn't want to associate myself with what I thought was a trend, a TikTok thing that would fizzle out like everything else. 

But I was staring down at a handwritten letter crumpled between my fists, from an anonymous tattletale calling out my real star sign.

The crossed O's stood out.

Who wrote like that?

I had been hiding under the facade of being a Sagittarius, since Sagittarius and Leo seemed to be the ""It"" signs. 

They stood on some fucking pedestal, ruling over campus like some messed-up clique.

The letter was like a slap in the face. I had half a mind to tear it into pieces. 

I stared down at it, my eyes stinging. This letter told me I didn't belong here. 

It told me that because the brainwashed hive mind on campus had decided to collectively despise the star I was born under, I was something to be feared, like an animal.

""Who *sent* this?"" I managed to get out. I squeezed the paper in my fist.

Dearest Dean,

The passive-aggressive tone made my blood boil.

I would like you to know of a traitor amongst you, a Sagittarius by the name of Oliver, who is in fact a Gemini :)

I am SO sorry for ruining your day :(

Anon.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. When I looked up, the Dean's glare was pinpointed directly in the middle of my forehead.

If looks could *kill.*

""I don't know what to say,"" I squeezed out.

She hummed. ""Well, you can start by explaining yourself.""

She had to be kidding, right?

No.

When I looked her dead in the eye, this woman was being serious.

""Miss Oliver, I am horrified that you would disguise yourself as a Sagittarius."" She curled her lip. ""As one myself, I should have sensed that our energy was wrong, polluted with your presence. But I let my guard down.""

I slammed the letter down. This woman was certifiably insane.

""Who sent this?"" I asked again, harsher this time.

""That is none of your concern,"" the Dean said. ""You lied, Miss Oliver.""

""About my zodiac sign."" I sucked in a breath. ""It's really not a big deal.""

Her eyes darkened. ""As you will discover, Miss Oliver, it is extremely important that we know where every Gemini is."" Her gaze flicked to her MacBook screen. ""Especially when certain measures have been put in place.""

""Measures?"" I straightened in my seat. ""What kind of measures?""

Her lip curled. ""You are a late arrival. It is your fault for not arriving on time.""

""You're kidding."" I scoffed. I was done. It was one thing for students to behave this way.

But grown adults?

The Dean couldn’t justify it. And even if she tried, she would be declared insane.

I leaned forward, testing the boundaries. I wasn’t surprised when the Dean lurched back. ""Was it a bad experience?""

She blinked. ""I don't understand.""

""A bad experience you had,"" I repeated. ""With a Gemini.""

The words suffocated my mouth, eager to spill out.

After weeks of feeling like I was back in sixth grade, finally confronting the root of the problem felt good.

""Because that is all it is, what you're all unhealthily obsessed with."" I spoke through my teeth now, weeks of repressed anger bubbling over. ""They're just stars. They don't mean anything to anyone, except children.""

""Miss Oliver—""

""See?"" Tracing along the constellation mapped out on her desk, I prodded each static light. To my confusion, it was the Gemini constellation, which was ironic.

I stabbed at the twin stars, Castor and Pollux, and then Alhena.

I nodded to Orion, projected across the wall. ""Stars. They're just stars. Dead and dying planets, or if you're religious, your long-dead relatives. Whatever.""

I pointed at the map crinkled under her MacBook, and the Dean once again flinched, her body angling away from me.

She leaned back like I was contagious. One of the guards started forward, no doubt to grab me, but she shook her head, keeping that professional, if slightly strained, smile.

""There is no need,"" the Dean said sharply, and the guards stepped back. ""Miss Oliver is understandably upset."" She cleared her throat.

""Please vacate your current dorm and move into the old building across campus where we house Geminis without rooms.""

The Dean stood before I could reply. ""I don't expect to see you in my office again.""

I grabbed my bag, rising to my feet. ""You're not throwing me out?""

Her lip twitched. ""We do not suspend Gemini students, Miss Oliver.""

""But what if I want to leave?""

""Because of the measures in place.""

Something warm wriggled up my throat, and I tried to speak, but the guards were already politely shoving me out of her office.

The Dean's words didn’t leave my mind until I was halfway across campus, out of breath and regretting every word I'd spat.

She’d sent me away with a warning and an order to leave my dorm room effective immediately and move into the old building off-campus. I had seen it in passing, a large, crumbling structure that used to be the student dorm.

The door was broken, bars on the windows. There was no way I was staying there. Couch-crashing in a friend's dorm seemed a lot better.

Elle was a Leo and insisted she didn’t care about star signs.

Coming from a Leo, that was rich. She had the full Leo experience.

I was moving into her room later that evening, playing cloak and dagger with the security guards on shift, when the announcement played over the intercom.

""Starting from 8pm, please lock ALL Geminis in their rooms. It is upon us.""

Elle froze, her eyes widening. Until that moment, she had been unusually quiet, the two of us cross-legged on the floor eating Chinese food. I thought she was just tired from classes.

She didn’t react at first. She sent me a sleepy smile, then said she was going to grab beer from the kitchen.

What I didn’t expect was for her to come back wielding one of her mom’s butcher knives. I stepped back, but her eyes terrified me. Her whole body trembled, fingers tightening around the handle.

Her expression twisted with a feral fear I couldn’t understand. ""Elle,"" I bit back a cry. ""Hey. It's me. It's Smith.""

""Get out."" She sobbed through the words. Her ponytail swung as she twisted toward the door. ""Please. I don’t want to hurt you."" She waved the knife wildly, and I raised my arms, my heart catapulting into my throat.

""You have fifteen minutes,"" the voice drawled, and Elle's expression hardened. 

""I repeat. Please lock ALL Geminis inside their rooms immediately and find a safe place. This warning will expire at 5am. Eight hours from now.""

A sudden bang outside set off my fight or flight, doors slamming and running footsteps. I found my eyes glued to the blade in my best friend’s hand. 

They were fucking serious about this.

The Dean really had turned a whole campus of students against one singular star sign.

Elle’s frightened eyes found me, and I lowered my arms. ""Wait, are you going to stab me?"" I took a slow step back towards the door. ""Because I was born in May?"" 

I couldn’t resist a laugh. ""You told me you didn’t care about the zodiac! You said all of this was BS! So, why now?"" 

Another step, and she squeaked. 

""Do you want to fit in, Elle? Are the other Leo’s making you do this?” 

She didn’t respond, and that pissed me off even more.

Elle didn’t know why she was afraid of me, because her head had been filled with crap.

I raised my arms in mock surrender. ""Why are you looking at me like that? Elle, I'm not going to hurt you! When have I ever...?"" 

I didn’t expect to cry, but my eyes were stinging. I could hear screaming, Geminis being attacked and locked up. I risked a step back, and her grip on the knife changed, like she was ready to use it.

""You are brainwashed,"" I said slowly. ""The Dean wants you to be scared. She's crazy, Elle. Like, delusional! She has some crazy vendetta against Geminis, and she's punishing us!""

Elle choked out a cry. ""Last month,"" she spoke through a sob. 

""One of you got into my room,"" Elle shook her head rapidly, squeezing her eyes shut. ""Just leave,"" she squeaked. 

""I’m sorry, Smith. I’ll explain, I promise. But you need to find someplace else, and it can't be here. It can't be tonight.”

She smiled, but her lips were strained, eyes wide. 

When I moved to try and reassure her, she jumped back, like a deer caught in headlights.

She was terrified of me.

""Lock yourself up,"" my friend said softly, and I realized I had lost her. ""But don’t hurt yourself."" Elle sniffled. ""They can climb through the windows and sense light. They follow it. So make sure to turn them off and stay down."" Her expression darkened.

""Can you promise me something?""

I found myself nodding dizzily.

Elle squeezed her eyes shut. ""Don’t look up.""

My gut twisted into tangled knots. ""What?""

Elle's words set something off inside me, but she was already dropping the knife and grabbing me gently, pushing me through the door. 

I was being shoved out into the hallway, my bags thrown in my face, when the alarms started blaring, red lights swarming the hallways.

I saw shadows darting in and out of rooms, others being shoved inside, while retreating figures made for the elevators.

A boy was violently dragged out by a girl and thrown on his ass. At that moment, I stopped seeing students. Kids. I was seeing wild animals crawling backward on their hands and knees, frightened eyes darting for a safe getaway.

A girl ran into me, dropping onto her knees before catapulting into a sprint.

She was caught by three guys who dragged her away, kicking and screaming.

I had no choice.

It was 7:50 when I found myself standing in front of the old building, halfway across campus, the alarms still ringing in my ears. 

The dorm looked more like a boarding house, with maybe two or three floors. The night felt eerily still, a half-moon poking through the clouds.

There was something glued to the front door, a simple white sheet of paper.

On it, scrawled in permanent marker, was: ""NO."" in bold letters.

The O was crossed, I noticed. Which was familiar.

""Five minutes,"" the intercom screeched, and in my panic, I knocked three times.

""Hello?"" I banged again. ""Hey, can someone let me in?""

I swallowed hard. ""I'm a...""

My star sign tangled in my throat when a crash sounded behind me. I twisted around. A group of students were dragging two others, bound and gagged, hauling them into a car trunk.

My stomach lurched into my throat. I turned back to knock again, only for my fists to meet something warm. 

A shadow stood in the doorway, golden light bleeding around him. 

I could barely make out his face, just a mop of reddish curls.

He tugged the paper off the door and held it out. The handwriting was unmistakable.

""No means no,"" he said, and moved to slam the door. I quickly wedged my heel in the way, blocking it.

He tried to shut the door on my foot, and in my panic, I shoved it back in his face.

The guy sputtered but didn’t try again. I made sure not to let my guard down.

“You told the Dean about me?” I hissed. “I’m sorry, did we go back to sixth grade?”

He snorted. “You can talk.”

More screams rang out behind us. I couldn’t resist trying to slip through the gap in the door, but he shoved me back, quick as a whip.

“What?”

The shadow paused, then stepped into the light. I glimpsed narrowed eyes and freckles. I tried to push past him, but he stood stubbornly in the way.

His eyes were hidden by a scuffed pair of Ray-Bans. “Ah, yes, the traitor!” he said, like he’d been waiting for this exact moment. “Hiding in Sagittarius, thinking we wouldn’t notice.” He cocked his head. “How’s that working out for ya?”

I heard laughter behind him.

Looking closer, I noticed something metal clamped around his wrist.

Was he... chained up?

“Traitor?” I managed to say.

He nodded with a grin. I had no doubt he’d stood in front of a mirror rehearsing these lines. It was either that, or he was a psychopath.

“The secret Gemini,” he said, making a huge show of blocking my way. “You’re actually famous around here! We turned your room into a relaxation lounge, so unfortunately...” 

He dragged out the “ey” sound like he was auditioning for The Joker. “There’s no room at the inn, dude.”

His lips curled into a spiteful smile. Behind me, another crash echoed.

Ice shot down my spine. I couldn’t bring myself to turn, to witness more brutality. The guy stiffened, but if he was scared, he didn’t show it.

He had too much pride. He hiked his glasses up his nose, revealing eyes shadowed by an eerie glow spreading across his pupils. 

For a moment, I thought I saw hurt crumple his expression, but in the blink of an eye it was gone, replaced with a surprisingly convincing façade.

His gaze followed mine.

Another kid was being mercilessly dragged across the parking lot.

When I turned back to him, his expression had darkened.

He slid his glasses back into place with emphasis. 

I swore this guy thought he was in fucking Glee. 

“Have fun locking yourself up,” he said, saluting me with two fingers before stepping back. Another jingle, and he flinched. 

This time, I saw it clearly, a rusted chain wrapped around his ankle and right wrist. 

He noticed me staring, and his lips curled into a scowl. The kid stepped behind the door, clearly embarrassed.

“This is your two-minute warning,” the intercom blared, still loud even halfway across the grounds.

Hearing the announcement, the guy gently kicked my foot out of the way, and I almost fell on my ass.

I could hear voices as I shuffled back. I checked my phone.

7:58.

Fuck.

“Wait,” I managed to hiss out.

He stopped for a moment, letting out a sigh.

“It wasn't hard to just accept your star sign,” he grumbled. “The rest of this school are psychos, but we take care of our own.”

“It's a *star sign*!” I gritted out. “Why are you going along with this?”

His jaw clenched. “You should go,” he hesitated. “The top floor is usually safe. Head to the girls' bathroom and lock yourself up.”

“You're fucking insane!”

I think part of me was hoping he was just trying to scare me, and then drag me inside at the last moment. 

But no, this kid really was throwing me to the animals.

The guy shrugged. “Yeah…” He shot me a grin. “Byeeeeee!” he said, slamming the door a little too hard in my face.

“Asshole!” I yelled, kicking the door. 

*“You shouldn't have sided with the Leo’s!”* He rebuttaled. 

Across campus, the warning lights were still flashing.

*“Why did you do that?”*

Another guy’s voice hissed from behind the door.

*“Because she’s a traitor.”*

*“Yeah, but she’s stuck out there,” a girl joined in. “Aren’t you being a little too harsh?”*

*“Nope. She can sit out there and rot.”*

I left them to argue and made my way back onto campus.

7:59.

Bathroom.

That was all I could think of. I started toward the main building when movement flashed in the corner of my eye. I saw them pouring out from campus, illuminated in brilliant orange from the torches in their hands.

Leos.

I recognized several faces from my class. They moved as one, a large group heading across campus toward the clearing in the woods.

They wore pajamas, normal clothes, like they were going to hang out.

But something in the air, prickling across my skin, told me different.

There were exclusive clubs on campus, but this was on a whole other level.

I ducked, mapping a way to get on campus without being caught.

If I could get to the door and make a clean break through the cafeteria, I could dive into the girls' bathroom next to the elevator.

I dropped to my knees, attempting to crawl, when I saw her.

The bright red hair was a giveaway, her bobbing ponytail frenzied as she joined the others.

Elle.

Another frantic look at my phone.

8:02.

I didn’t expect her to see me. She was looking around frantically, unlike the others whose eyes were set forward. It looked like she was searching for a way out, staggering over uneven ground.

Then her eyes found mine. 

Initially, Elle looked relieved, and then her gaze went to the sky, flicking back to me. She strayed back, before stumbling over, pulling something from her jeans pocket. It was a much sharper knife, the blade glinting under the moonlight cast across the grounds.

“Tell me your name,” she said in a squeak. “I need to know it’s you.”

I had half a mind to question her before I remembered the Gemini boy chained up.

""Smith,"" I gasped out. ""I'm… I'm Smith.""

Elle hesitated. She twisted around, scanning the night, and then turned back to me. Her frenzied eyes searched mine. ""What is my most embarrassing story?""

""What?!""

In two strides, she was holding the knife to my throat, her hand trembling. The steel was cold, and I had no doubt that she wouldn't hesitate to press deeper.

""Say it, Smith. Word for word.""

Behind her, the Leos were gone, with only some stragglers left behind. 

I nodded slowly, trying to ignore the blade digging into my skin. 

This was my new normal.

""You… you had your period in your boyfriend's parents' new car,"" I whispered. ""You still have nightmares about it.""

Her expression crumpled with relief, and she dropped the knife.

""How about mine?"" I urged her.

Elle surprised me with a quiet laugh. ""You barfed tacos all over your crush on your first date,"" she choked out. ""And he never talked to you again.""

I started to speak, but Elle tugged off her jacket, wrapping it around my eyes.

At first, I fought back, but then her hands, and then her fingernails, dug into the bare flesh of my arms. Her touch was reassuring as she dragged her hands up my arms and then grasped hold of my shoulders.

""I told you not to look up,"" her voice came out in an annoyed hiss.

""I didn't,"" I bit back a cry when she dug her nails in further. ""What's happening?""

""I'll explain later.""

""How can you guys tell who is a Gemini?"" I whispered. ""I don't get it.""

Elle didn’t respond for a moment. ""Your eyes,"" she whimpered. ""It's in your eyes.""

""What do you mean by that?""

""Shush,"" Elle muttered. ""Just stay quiet, okay?""

Elle pulled me to my feet, and I staggered blindly, trying to balance myself. ""I'll take you to the bathroom,"" she breathed, shoving me forward. ""But if you tell anyone I helped you–""

""I won't."" I tripped over something, almost falling on my face. The further we went, the more I could sense something… light.

It started as a pinprick behind my eyes, before spreading, light bleeding through the material of Elle's jacket. There was one bright spot of light, and then another, and another.

Speckled illuminations like glitter illuminating the night.

Closer, they told me.

I followed them almost giddily, watching them burn through Elle's jacket. When the sound of thundering footsteps sliced through me, I turned my head, trying to sense where it was coming from.

""What's that?"" I didn’t realize I was laughing until manic giggles spurted from my lips. It was like being high, my thoughts bleeding into cotton candy.

Suddenly, all I wanted was to see the lights. They felt so far away, and yet also like I could reach them, plucking them straight out of the sky. I laughed again, my body a puppet as I reached out and tried to catch them in my palm.

""I said be quiet!"" Elle whisper-shrieked.

""I am!""

I was curious about the light. It was so bright, and I was missing out on fully taking it in. I stumbled again, this time my footsteps tangled. I didn’t hear the voice until it was in my head, a whisper telling me to pull away the blindfold.

It was choking me, suffocating my thoughts and filling me with a taste of her. I saw it, just a glimpse dancing across my peripheral vision.

I had my fingers clawing into Elle's jacket, ready to rip it off, when someone else did it for me.

""Leo. What are you doing out here?""

The voice was familiar, but it was being drowned out.

By its light.

Its song.

""I'm locking her up,"" Elle said shakily.

Darkness made way for light, and I blinked rapidly. I could sense my head tipping back, and then Elle's fingers in my hair, trying to shove my head down.

Blinking rapidly, I saw the Dean of the college, and my best friend's pale face.

And then I saw the stampede suffocated in shadow, silhouettes passing me, ethereal light illuminating otherwise vacant eyes. The lights resembled stars themselves, dancing through the night.

It was the same light that was seeping into me. It felt cozy and warm, already ignited inside them.

I could tell who they were from their attempts to lock themselves up. 

I glimpsed handcuffs around wrists, makeshift ropes still clinging to arms and ankles, duct tape over mouths. 

When my gaze followed the horde, I caught sight of a cuffed ankle, a stray chain trailing behind him, the guy who locked me out. 

He moved slowly, like a zombie. His glasses were awkwardly placed on the top of his head, eyes drowned by that… that light.

I caught a slight wrinkle in his brow. 

When the others matched forwards, he stumbled back for a moment.

*Was he… pretending to be part of the hoard?*

He was a good actor, perfectly mimicking the others. 

His head was tipped back, arms by his sides, eyes forward, unblinking. 

His gaze flickered to me, lips mouthing five single words. 

**Do not fucking look up.**

But I couldn't *not* look. 

The light was teasing me, seeping into me like honey.

It wasn't moonlight. I could glimpse the crescent glowing under the clouds.

Geminis.

They were bathed in it, a swimming glow I wanted to dive into.

All of them.

Where were they going?

Unlike the Leos, their expressions were blank as they staggered along, akin to a crowd of zombies. I remember not being able to concentrate on the Geminis.

Something was holding onto me, winding its way into my brain. 

I felt it reach directly into the back of my head, phantom fingers taking me into its grasp. I didn't mean to look up. I tipped my head back, drinking in the sky above me, and the night that suddenly felt alive. 

In the corner of my eye, the Gemini guy was grabbing his friends, pulling them into the trees. The Gemini horde stopped suddenly, heads tipping back, glowing eyes following suit. I blinked twice. 

Elle was already covering my eyes, and I wrenched her hands away so I could see… clearly.

I could feel it, sense it, consuming me, filling my thoughts with a lulling fog.

""Smith!""

Elle's eyes found mine, and she dropped to her knees. Like she was scared of me. 

I remember her lips had formed the words in breathy sobs. **Don't look–**

Before she could reach up, I blinked again, and this time it was a longer one.

I started toward… something…

It was there. I just had to reach as high as I could.

Then I would be able to… touch it.

Starry eyes surrounded me, but I don't remember being scared. 

Elle's cry rattled in my skull as I felt my body lurch on its own, driven by something else, a sentient thing inside me. 

I could feel my mind filling with fog. It told me to go to sleep, and I did.

When I came to, it was no longer night. Artificial white light buzzed above me.

The first thing I felt was something wet oozing down my chin.

Then… cool porcelain pressed against my cheek.

I was in a bathroom stall, my head stuck down a toilet bowl.

But it was different from waking up hungover.

I felt... filthy.

My body was aching, a striking pain rippling across the back of my head. 

When I lifted my neck slightly, a snapping sound made me jump, like my bones were popping back into place. 

My memory was gone, my thoughts a whirlwind lost to the dark. I could still see Elle's face illuminated in that startling light.

The shadowy horde around me, starry eyes burning into me.

Then there was nothing.

The familiar ice-cold graze of porcelain greeted me when I pried my eyes open.

There was something in my mouth, and I spat it out, expecting stale barf. What I wasn’t expecting was a wet piece of flesh to splash down into the bowl.

It took me several seconds to realize the toilet bowl I had my head down was not empty.

In the flickering light from the broken fixture above me, I saw the glistening red first, spattered on the lid, and when I looked down, on the floor too, staining my knees.

And then I saw all of it. The bulging, slimy red mess sticking from the bowl.

I lurched back, and something was stuck at the back of my throat.

I reached into my mouth, cringing, and pulled out what looked like a mauled finger, skinned of flesh. 

There were only spiky pieces of bone fragments clinging to shredded muscle.

Something inhuman croaked from my lips, and I slammed my hands over my mouth, my gut twisting.

I looked up.

Red.

I looked down.

More red.

Vivid, wet, and recent.

I was covered in dirt and grass stains, my legs bloodied and bruised, half of my hair ripped out.

The walls around me were the same shade, glistening, pooling, disgusting red, dripping and staining every surface.

The lumpy red mass sticking from the toilet bowl suddenly looked less like a mass the more I was looking at it, blinking through the blinding light.

At some point, I screamed, heaving up the rest, wet globules of fat spilling from my mouth. There was a head in the toilet bowl, stuck right under, like I had been trying to hide the evidence.

The head didn’t look like a head, half of its skull crushed. But I could still make out familiar features. Eyes still wide open, lips frozen in what looked like a scream.

The rest of her had presumably been flushed, but I could still see pieces of her clinging to the rim of the toilet.

Elle. 

Oh god, fuck, I killed my best friend. 

I'm still sitting here. I can't bring myself to move. Normal college life still goes on outside, and I can't understand how. 

I found myself back at the Gemini house a few hours ago. It was locked, but there was a small key wrapped in some paper. 

**I was FORCED to give you this, Oliver. Don't touch my stuff. You're sharing with Elena. Don't think this means any of us trust you. Welcome to the madhouse.**

“Coming in?”

The voice startled me. 

I twisted around, and there he was, the asshole Gemini. 

I took pleasure in walking away, dumping both the key and the note in the trash. 

I ask this as a Gemini. 

Preferably on campus, but this goes for all of you. 

Did any of you kill and eat someone last night with no memory of doing so? 

I'm starting to think the Gemini constellation is something more than a group of stars after all.

However I was blindsided so it wasn’t a gradual breakup. One day he was loving and the next he treated me like a stranger. We dated 5 years and lived together.

I moved out right away to live with my mom. I got severely depressed and felt hopeless. Reached out to him in desperation. We talked a bit then went no contact. 1 month later he profusely apologizes admitting he’s been incredibly sad I’m gone and will sob in his car. He wanted to go for coffee and talk.

I was still traumatized so I asked for time. And told him I’d reach out when I was ready.

Fast forward 3 more weeks I call him on the phone to schedule our coffee meet up. We ended up talking all night. However his demeanour was completely different. He seemed happier with me gone. He’d been doing more hobbies, working more, being with friends. He said he has no romantic feelings for me but he’ll always love me. 

I was so shocked since his last conversation he admitted he felt things for me. So much hot and cold behaviour. He still wants to meet for coffee and be friends. I told him he needs to start therapy before I see him next(he was already planning on therapy). However he said “it might be a while” even though therapy where he is is VERY accessible. 

It’s been a month already. I want to reach out so badly to see if he’s started therapy. But I feel like it’s better I wait for him to reach out since I’m the desperate one.

I’m bored with this weather and always curious to hear other folks favorite spots! I’ve got a bad habit of exploring spots once I establish my go-tos. 

In no specific order:

Pizza: Gotta start off controversial here, but **Wheelz**. I love the sourdough crust, very consistent every time I’ve gotten it, and not too heavy. Everyone is different. Not a fan of deep dish stuff. **Brooklyn Pizza Co.** is a close 2nd. 

Coffee: **Maven**. I’ve traveled the world and can honestly put them top 10 all time for me. The owner is super knowledgeable and is a master of his craft. 

Burgers: Admittedly haven’t explored a lot of spots after having **Grimmburger**. Love their Carolina reaper burger. Perfect level of spice and delicious all around. 

Mexican: I’ll stop gate keeping here - but **Tortilleria Y Taqueria Carolinas**. The best burrito in town full stop. I’ve also had the quesabarria tacos - very solid. 

Upscale dinner: **Kipos**. I’ve seen some hate on this place, but I can’t help but disagree full stop. It’s expensive, sure, but it’s really great food. Every app, dish, desert I’ve gotten there has been phenomenal. 

Cocktails: **The blind elephant**. Solid menu - not much of a drinker anymore - but the vibes were super cool. Close second (but niche situation) is Concorde espresso. Love a good fire pit with some s’mores and cocktails. 

Casual lunch: **PTs/Saltworks** \- tie here. Love em both equally. The PTs grilled chicken sandwich is absolute fire. Saltworks makes me feel like I’m at a family cookout in a good way. No thrills and frills. Just solid food. 

Bagels: **S&L** by a long shot. Some of the best bagels I’ve ever had. Staff is super nice and the New York memorabilia and vibes are top notch. 

Sushi: **Sushi Tadokoro** \- as a sushi lover that has been to Japan, I will say Wilmington was missing a spot like this. I’m talking high end fish offerings flown in. Not fried rolls with cream cheese and the like. If you like real sushi - this is your spot. 

Poke: **Pipeline Poke** \- this spot is so good. Their spicy tuna lava poke bowl is unreal. I have not found a spot that comes close (although I haven’t felt the need to explore further haha). 

Sandwich: **Spoonfed Kitchen -** kind of niche, but I love their bahn mi chicken sandwich. Such a unique take on a bahn mi, full of flavor, chicken is grilled to perfection.  

Breakfast - **Amanecer Cocina & Café** \- just recently found this spot and holy hell they have some of the best breakfast burritos I’ve ever had. Pancakes are also absolutely fire. 10/10

This is a chunky story, but I would love to get your perspective on it! 

**Context:** 

I (38F) have been single for a while, and now in the new year, I thought I would start to put myself out there to give dating a chance.

I have been single for the last 5 years - and very happily single. I have maybe been on one or two dates these past years, but I have not actively pursued dating. Instead, I have focused on figuring out stuff about myself. For example, during these past 5 years I have discovered I am more neurospicy (on the ADHD spectrum) than I knew previously, which was amazing to figure out \**important context for later*\*.

For example, I sometimes don't understand if people are into me. These couple of dates I have been on in the past years have been with people I thought just wanted to be friends and wanted to grab a coffee/tea (very common culture thing where I live to grab coffee/tea with people of all genders without it being a big thing). Then, while sitting there in a cosy cafe with dimmed lighting, sipping my Earl Grey tea in hand, I start to notice the person I am with asking me very personal questions for just being friends hanging out, then mentioning previous relations and suddenly, like a deer in headlight I realise - ""Holy shit, this is a date."" I totally panic on the inside, like a piñata that has been smashed by mistake and I am trying to collect all the pieces to rebuild it (don't know if that makes sense, but it does to me). This has happened several times, and  - oh boy it is awkward.

Long story short and to conclude, reading subtext and signs is hard for me (either in text or in person).

Important side note\*\*:\*\* Since figuring out my neurospiciness, I have been on the right medication for a little bit over a year, and as a side effect, I have lost just under 90 lbs. I don't try to focus on that at all because I think I look good, whatever size I am, and the most important thing is my mental health. Starting to fixate on weight is nooooot good for me in the past, so I am not even going to open that door. 

**To the story:** 

So here I am approaching my 40s, and since I have not dated in a while I thought I would try dating apps again, after a 10-year break from them. I created a profile and showed two friends (F38 and M38), who started dating via an app, and asked what they thought of the profile. It has quirky text (to represent who I am) and what I thought were quite representative photos of me - my face and me with my hobbies! The photos were mainly profile photos and not full-body photos \**important info for later\**. In my dating description, I write out that I am looking for a long-term relationship and that I am curvy because that is the truth, despite the weight loss. My friends thought it sounded good, and on New Year's I published the profile! 

Two weeks-ish ago, I matched with a guy in his 30s - lets call him J. He was laughing in almost all his photos and I thought “he looked nice”. No supermodel or anything - just an average Joe. Important note, I lean more towards being pansexual, so I get attracted to the vibes of a person and not generally their looks. So here is a laughing, funny person in their profile, so I thought -  I give him a chance. 

We started out texting on the app, and he seemed flirty, and I tried to be flirty back, but as I say, reading subtext is hard for me. As this is one of the first people I talk to on the app, I am careful and want to go slow. At the same time, I am having a very stressful time at work, so I can’t reply so fast on the app. We chat about work and where we have travelled. 

I said, for example, I have been lucky to study abroad because of scholarships, and I tried to be quirky and fun so I added: 

Me: “I got the scholarships because I am a smart cookie”. 

J: “really smart. ;) bet you are a tasty cookie”. 

I just didn't respond to that because yeah - how do you respond since I don't know this person and I don't know. This stuff is hard for me. It also came off a bit creepy since this was like 1 or two days into the conversation. I don't know, this might be normal for people who know how to flirt - you tell me!

He also highlights in a message shortly after that I write that I am curvy in the profile, and he is curious about what that means. I say maybe he will find out one day and start to chat about other stuff, trying to move away from the subject.

A message two or so later, he comments that my pictures are mostly profile pictures and not “all of you”. I looked at my photos, and replied truthfully: “yeah you know what, I haven't thought about it before, but you are right”. Then I moved on to try to change the topic, saying, “Guess I am a tease, haha”, trying to be flirty but desperate to change the subject away from any focus on my body. 

He continued to state:

“Absolutey. But on a dating site, one would like to see the whole package right away, and then I don't mean anything naked, just a regular full body image. Thank you!”

So I didn't respond because, honestly, I got caught at work and had one of the most stressful work weeks in months. When I did respond, I explained how busy I had been with work that week and asked him how his week had been, clearly not responding to what I interpreted as a demand, but I might have been reading it wrong - I thought.

After a message about his weekend, he tagged and returned to his previous message - “Answer to this?” 

I answered him, saying that I understood he wanted a whole body picture, but I didn't feel comfortable sending him one yet and would rather talk about other things. 

Then he replied:  

J: “I understand you find it shallow, but as I said, I want to see the whole package before I put time into getting to know a person better. Then the physical is not that relevant to me, I am interested in the deep stuff, but I don't like surprises” 

This pissed me off sooooooooo hard. But I thought maybe I am reading this wrong so I simply replied:

Me: “What would a surprise be according to you?”

J: “Would you buy a dress if you only saw ⅓ of it?”

Me: “Explain further.”

J: “If you can’t understand and respect what I want, then let's not put more time into this”

So I got mad. I debated back and forth in my head about what to do. There I was on a Monday, sprawled out on the sofa, exhausted from work, getting into an argument with a man whom I had never met over me setting I thought a pretty clear boundary. I felt I didn’t need this. I replied: 

Me: “I wanted to hear your perspective and wanted you to respect my choice of not yet sending the pics. To be honest, it's pretty manipulative to say that you won't talk to me further unless I send you a pic. 

Great that you compare you a living person to an object \**note heavy sarcasm*\*. You say you are not shallow, but it seems you are not honest with yourself. 

I wanted to get to know you as a person before I would be comfortable sending pictures, but we are not interested in the same thing here, so I say we say goodbye”

I wanted to block this guy right away, but as I understood it, he wouldn't see my message if I blocked him then and there, so I waited a few minutes. During these short minutes, I got a message back where he portrayed himself as a victim, and how dare I call him manipulative? He got the message - great - and with a swish and flick - I blocked him. Goodbye!

I was so furious, but at the same time I felt conflicted - is this something people do? Is this a given that there is some hidden rule that on dating apps, one should have at least one full-body pic? Was I wrong to not comply with his request? Is this normal? What would have happened if I had sent one, and then he would have judged me afterwards?

I’m exploring whether there’s any real demand for a quiet, adult-focused space where people could read, study, or work without the usual café pressure (noise, time limits, uncomfortable, etc.). Think more “lingering with a book” than productivity hustle — with optional things like coffee during the day, wine/drinks in the evening (speakeasy feel), and occasional hosted events (e.g., book club, silent reading parties, poetry/jazz evenings, etc.)

Before going any further, I want to sanity-check whether this is something people here would actually use, or if it’s just a nice-sounding idea that doesn’t fit San Diego.

Some questions I have for you all are:

\- Is this realistically a place you’d frequent?

\- What's missing or frustrates you when you’ve gone to read or study at other cafés/bookstores/bars?

\- What do you wish a place like this would have? (E.g., free books, comfy chairs, etc.)

\- Would you be open to paying for access or membership benefits (e.g., discounts, reserved seating, events)?

If you don’t think this is needed, I’d honestly love to hear that too — especially why. I’m trying to understand the gaps (or lack of them) before making any decisions.

Graveyard shift. 3:17 a.m. Level B-West, sub-basement. Three years, same forty-minute loop. Fire doors. Card readers. Elevators are not jammed open. Routine. Boring. Soul-eating.

Until it wasn’it.

Turned the corner on sub-level 4. Froze. Yellow emergency strips painted everything sick. The stairwell was wrong. Railings bent in, steps stretched out, more than seventeen. I counted. Nineteen. Twenty-one. Too many.

Just the angle, and I told myself. Just the light. Double shift chewing at my brain.

Then I heard it.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

Soft, wet scrape from below. Like feet peeling off wet linoleum. Drag. Pause. Drag. Closer. Never a rhythm. I froze. Radio in my hand, dead weight. Who would I call? Facilities locked up. The supervisor is probably snoring upstairs. Whatever was down there, it didn’t want company.

I backed up one step. The scrape stopped instantly.

Dead silence.

Then, very faintly, I heard a low, wet exhale. Not a sigh. More like someone trying to remember how to use their lungs.

Flashlight shaking in my hand. I pointed it down. The beam caught a long, dark yellow smear on the landing. Fresh paint, but wrong. It moved. Rippled. Something down there, breathing.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I ran. Up the stairs. Lungs burning, boots slamming. The rail is too cold, slick with something. Didn’t look back. If I did, the stairs would stretch. That thing would be closer.

Slammed into the sub-level 3 fire door. Panic bar clanged. It opened. Thank God. I stumbled into the corridor. Beige walls. Lights working. Old coffee stinks from the break room.

The door slammed shut behind me. I leaned hard, chest heaving.

From the other side came one last sound.

Not scraping this time.

A single, deliberate knock.

Patient. Polite.

Like someone asking to be let back in.

I didn’t open the door.

I didn’t go back down there for the rest of the shift.

But sometimes, when the building goes dead quiet, and I’m alone in the security office, I hear it again.

1qn60ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/scrum/comments/1qn60ac/need_some_advice_from_seasoned_sms/,Need some advice from seasoned SMs,"Hi!! It’s me again! I’d love to hear some advice from seasoned Scrum Masters regarding my situation. I’m still new to the role and while I do work with other SMs, they can’t help me because they aren’t that familiar with scrum to the extent despite working as one for a year or two (don’t ask me why).

Anyway, I spoke to our PO because I’ve noticed a bottleneck in his plate so I asked if there’s anything I could do to help him. He opened up to me that the process doesn’t make sense to him for xyz reasons and he’s keen to have a retro-style discussion with the leadership team (Release Managers, Delivery Managers, Product Owners, Tech Leads and Scrum Masters). I brought this up to the managers and they agreed that there is, indeed a problem in the process, so the DM gave me a green light to set up a meeting.

I was thinking of using Lean Coffee for the meeting BUT SM said we should have a meeting first internally with the RMs before getting the POs and TLs involved. Basically, we have to share with them first the problem, current process and present our proposed solution before discussing it with POs and TLs. I’m a bit adamant because of the lack of transparency. I’d like to hear their POV too because as an SM, the whole process is fucking up the sprint report and it baffles me how they tolerate this. 

My question: is this the correct approach? Should we discuss it internally first before getting the POs and TLs involved? ",1,1769401549.0,scrum,1,1.0,False

We click pretty well on that level, and we became fast friends. 

I saw her through some pretty rough times and she saw me through some very different hard times. We've been through two or three different friend flushes over the years. That's when some stupid drama happens and all of your friends turn their back on you and you have to start from scratch. Both of us happen to be in similar communities where that is sadly a common occurrence. We both just happen to be very good at what we do and don't want to leave those communities because it pays too well. 

I'm a shibari rope Top of some renown and she's a professional Dominatrix. Anyone familiar with the BDSM community knows how two very toppy people can make excellent friends but lousy romance partners. 

The community we're in is a bit rife with rumor Mills being used to discredit other tops. She's had my back on several occasions so I owed her a lot. Then she got very ill. 

The diagnosis was difficult because of the way the doctors were throwing the. ""It's all in your head"" line at her. Turns out it was an autoimmune disorder. Terminal. She didn't have the insurance. She would need to get rid of the part of her body that had been destroyed so she was living in intense chronic pain. 

She asked me if I knew anybody in the military that would do a contract marriage so that she could get the insurance she needed because she was disabled now. She later admitted that she was actually asking me to marry her since I had that type of insurance. It's sort of how we have always asked each other favors. Neither of us do very well at being told what to do, but both of us are very good at helping a friend in need. 

So we got ourselves into a contract marriage for insurance benefits for her and her daughter. Part of the deal was also that I was going to help her with custody because she wasn't liking the 50/50. Her ex still lived at home with his parents and one of them is a registered sex offender. But considering that she's a professional dominatrix, the judges decided on 50/50 for whatever reason. Being married and having a home though would give her a lot more leverage in removing her daughter from danger. I also have a daughter that I'm trying to be involved with. In my situation she just refuses to put my name on the birth certificate so I have no rights as a parent and she has enough money to make fighting it very expensive, especially without having a family or home that my daughter can integrate with. Where I'm from men get very few wins in court. Especially ones who are well known in the BDSM community. There were a few conditions placed for both of us. 

Both of us had been through a lot of relationships. No one wants to date a dominatrix or a guy who touches beautiful women all day. Not long-term. Neither one of us was interested in getting into a romantic marriage. We both are of the opinion that marriage is there for tax benefits and should only be done by people who are getting married with their brains, not their hearts. Date with your heart. Marry with your brain. It's a common mantra with us. I've been married before and regretted it. Long story for a different post. I wasn't going to do a sexless marriage though and she agreed. We already were friends with benefits so she just guaranteed me that I'd never go without.

We're also very realistic and insisted on a yours/mine/ours prenup. The only caveat in that was a clause stating that if there's any physical or emotional abuse provable in criminal court . That the other party would be responsible for any costs including lawyer fees if it got argued in court. 

That was a year and a half ago. About 6 months into the marriage. She actually met a guy that was perfect for her. She's very picky about anybody that she gets romantically involved with. She didn't expect to ever find anyone. Her tastes are rather extreme. She found one though and she was very happy. I was happy for her. Her level of depression was getting really bad and she was missing doctor's appointments or not making them in the first place. I was taking care of everything because I knew that once we got her that expensive surgery she needed. Her pain levels would drop and she'd be a lot more functional. I felt like she was giving up but this guy brought new life into her and kept her going. She finally started making the appointments she needed to make and she should be having her surgery or may have already had her surgery. I don't know at this point. Due to the no contact order. I should probably get into that part soon. 

I told her she should be honest with him about the nature of our marriage. She said that he would not stick around if that was the case. So she lied to him and told him that me and her were just friends and there was no sex involved. I like the guy and wanted to be friends with him but I'm not very good at lying to friends. He saw me acting really weird around him and assumed it was because I had some kind of crush on her. That wasn't the case. I do have abandonment issues though and I saw what was happening because she insisted on being dishonest with him. More and more she stopped talking to me and I was trying to bring up some very important conversations about our future plans with her boyfriend now being involved. Any subject about this put her in mass amounts of pain because stress triggered her into muscle spasms that were blindingly painful. So for the next 8 months I slowly saw less and less of her at the house. She would come home an hour after I went to bed and leave an hour before I got home from work. I was feeling pretty abandoned so I wasn't handling things too well. One day she comes home and says that I need to move out in 7 days. I expressed to her that we agreed on a 60-day notice if things went South. She did not handle pushback very well on that. The pain was getting to the point where she was being pretty irrational. She started yelling at me and picked up a toy from the coffee table and through it. She almost hit her daughter with that. She wasn't aiming at her but it definitely scared her daughter. She consoled her daughter and I left to go downstairs to continue working with the model I was working with. That model happened to be in the stairway in view of me but not my wife. She heard the entire exchange. 

Later I found out that she went to the police a few days later and reported that I was yelling at her and throwing things and that I had scared her daughter and that her daughter had to sleep with her that night with a bookcase in front of the door. She put an EPO out on me and removed me from the house for 3 days. 

After the 3 days I came back to find all of my stuff had been removed and placed in the garage with prejudice about $10,000 worth of damage and missing items after I inventoried. Some of it was definitely malicious. My mattress got peed on and my TV and monitors had been kicked in. Two missing computers and my 3D printer was destroyed by having etching tools jammed into the gears. 

Did I mention that her boyfriend really didn't like me at all. He had recently threatened me with blackmail. He was going to spread rumors about sexual assault if I didn't leave her alone. These are the same kind of threats I've gotten before and that my wife had promised and had defended me from in the past. I don't think she had the strength to do any of the damage or move any of my stuff. I'm pretty sure she had him do it. 

When I came back to the residence after the 72 hours I videotaped everything from the walk up the driveway all the way to the walk back to my car. 

They heard me from upstairs and called the police immediately. They then put in a stalking charge against me saying that I had snuck in through the doggie door which was locked and then stated that I put an earbud down as a listening device. They were afraid for their life due to the claims from the EPO. I was arrested at work about a month later. 

NNow I'm going to court in the near future. Stalking charges are criminal. She also stated that I was her roommate on the EPO and a former friend on the stalking charge. So instead of going to domestic Court it's going to criminal Court. She's already perjured herself on that level. I also have evidence with the video and the witness showing that she perjured herself there as well. 

At some point the prosecution is going to ask me why she wanted me to move out if it wasn't actually being violent to her. At that point I'm going to have to reveal that her and I had a sexual relationship and that she doesn't want her boyfriend to find out so she needed to remove that possibility. She wasn't thinking straight because of her condition. He's not going to take that very well. Especially considering that he got off on joking about sleeping with my wife. 

At this point I'm not going to perjure myself for her benefit. The friendship is over. I will be getting an EPO on him. He's going to lose all of his gun collection in the process. If he doesn't leave her right away, the relationship is going to suffer pretty badly from it. The trauma very well may kill her in her current state . 

I don't think I'm being the asshole, but I'd like some thoughts. ",0,1769400586.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

If you don’t know anything about the culture of Provo I’d recommend a quick TikTok search and you’ll get the idea. 

This happened a little over a year ago and still think it’s insane. For some context I lived with 3 other roommates in a little apartment. We all grew up Mormon and have since left the church. Living in Provo is difficult if you aren’t a member and we decided we wanted to make our home a safe space. When anyone moved out our landlord allowed us to choose a new roommate. Which was perfect because we could find people with our same values. 

That was until a year ago when she refused to let us pick and put in someone she thought would be a good fit. Upon finding her Instagram we could tell she was extremely religious. Now none of us have a problem with someone living their own lifestyle and truth, however there tends to be no respect the other way around. 

Upon her moving in we tried to get to know her and be welcoming but eventually sat her down and let her know that we would be indulging in “sinful” activities if you will. Namely drinking alcohol, tea, coffee, watching rated R movies and having our boyfriends occasionally spent the night. 

She was very chill and seemed to have no problem with us doing our own thing. Which was exciting and made us all hopeful for a peaceful year. 

Until a few days later I had spend the night at my boyfriends place and saw she had posted a new instagram story so decided to see what she was up to. Come to find out she had posted that she was selling her lease as soon as possible. She had also reached out to our landlord about our “behavior.” Mind you nothing had even happened at this point. We were all busy with work and doing our own thing.

For background: I’ve been using a breville bambino plus and breville smart grinder pro for about 4 years. I’d like to upgrade and I think the grinder is the weakest link at this point.

I also make pour over coffee regularly with a hand grinder, and if I could get a grinder that can easily switch between espresso and pour over that would be nice, but the priority is espresso. I drink a range of roasts, but I would say I’m more modern style, NOT typically really dark classic espresso roasts. Therefore I dont really know where I sit on the flat vs conical decision. As much as interchangeable burrs is intriguing, I am more likely to stick with a setup I like than change frequently.

I’m looking for something <$1000 CDN (so the tariff situation may throw a wrench in some recommendations).

The grinders I’ve been looking at:

**- Varia VS4**

*Seems like the front runner currently: seems like a good combo between conical but still able to have good separation in flavours, but it’s pretty new, reviews seem good but not over the moon? I like the look and easy clean ability.*

\- **Df64v Gen 2 (or Gen 3 if it drops soon?)**

*Initially I thought this was the easy choice inexpensive upgrade, but it seems you get what you pay for with these.*

**- Timemore 064s**

*seems well liked, but still a top recommendation in 2026?*

**- Option-O Lagom casa**

*Ok reviews, people love the p64 but less press on the lagom casa?*

But I made espresso with both Ugandan Bugisu and Sumatran beans a day after roasting. 

I liked the coffee very much. Yes, they improved, (well , the Bugisu. The Sumatra batch is just a day old ) over time, meaning the flavors melded.

I would go so far as to say  the separation is better the fresher the coffee. 

Just a small sample so I will not generalize.

 But it is interesting to note native Ethiopians, in their coffee ceremonies, roast the coffee at or by the table, then immediately brew and drink the Coffee. So, from my own experience and taste, it is not as crazy it first sounded to me. 

The ~24 hour fresh coffee I have tried so far as been very drinkable and different.  Question Authority!

We have barely talked but he has definitely been doing more around the house yesterday after it happened and today. Last night he surprised me with my fav Coke and Oreos and this morning he made breakfast and brought me coffee from my favorite cafe. I know he feels bad. I also feel bad about how I yelled at him. I’ve yelled at him almost everyday for like a week because all he does is work. There’s no boundaries. He gets home from his day job and then is on meetings all afternoon for the business. He travels a lot for work also so I’m solo parenting all the time…I never get time to myself. I haven’t gotten sleep for over a year now.

Not because I don’t know what I want—but because I finally do.

I’m 35, a full-time dad of two incredible kids who mean the absolute world to me. They’re not just part of my life; they’re the center of it. Their laughter, curiosity, and fresh way of seeing the world remind me daily of what really matters.

After a lot of soul-searching (and some hard lessons), I’ve realized something simple and true about myself: I’m not meant to walk through life alone. No matter how independent or resilient I become, I’m someone who feels most whole when I’m sharing love with another person. Not just the big, cinematic moments—but the quiet ones. Morning coffee. Inside jokes. Talking about nothing and everything. Being fully seen, and fully showing up in return.

I’ve done the work. I’ve taken responsibility for who I was, who I am, and who I still want to be. I know how I need to be better in a relationship, and I’m clear about what I’m looking for—not perfection, but presence. Emotional availability. Kindness. A willingness to grow together.

You don’t have to be a mom. That’s not a requirement. But understanding (or at least being open to understanding) some of the trials and joys that come with loving someone who has kids will matter. What matters more is loving the magic that fresh minds bring into the world—the chaos, the wonder, the endless questions.

If you’re someone who believes love is built in the small moments, who values depth over games, and who is looking for a place to land and build something real—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

Here’s to honesty, courage, and seeing where a simple post might lead.

1qn5h21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qn5h21,"Bad Petco rat or long term illness? My $1,500 free corn snake story on why you should always trust your instincts.","Oh boy where do I even begin here. I acquired my lovely Chili girl nearly 2 years ago and I've loved her ever since. She was an 8 yr old surrender when I obtained her and the person who I got her from gave me no info on her except for her age, gender, what she ate and the fact she loved being wrapped around people's necks every morning while you drank coffee. He seemed very sad about it, left very quickly and I ended up with a free Corn Snake I hadn't exactly planned on. (Don't worry I had done lots of research on snakes before hand! Reptiles have always been my special interest. It felt like this man had just gifted me pure gold when he gave her to me.). My dad definitely loved her too.... definitely....

From the get go I noticed she was an odd little lady. She had a shedding schedule of once a month, retained water behind her neck before shedding (you can see so in photo 2) and she made audible breathing puffs when stressed.

Immediately I was concerned and so I took her to the vets as one would. Just to be told she was perfectly healthy, happy and I was being super anxious for nothing. After that I worried less and less and for about a year things were smooth sailing. She was always hungry, perfect energy levels, and never bit, not once not even now. The only weird things that remained were her water retention and the audible puffs.

One night I received a rat from Petco that looked and smelled ever so slightly off. I thought it was weird and didn't want to feed it to her but was told I was being dramatic and too anxious so I gave in something I still regret to this day. Maybe 2 weeks later my Chili girl started loosing color, she became more active rubbing her face on her glass until her nose was raw, (photo 3) and then she became less active and held water even when she wasn't shedding.

Her face would suddenly swell rapidly for a few minutes before returning to normal like it had never happened. Then after a while she stopped shedding entirely. I quickly quarantined her and she was like this for a month as I closely monitored her health.

After a bit she refused to eat and shortly after all bowel movements stopped. Despite my concerns I was still told then that I was being overly paranoid and that the vets bills would cost too much for a snake her age.

The day my mother finally set an appointment came much later than it should have. I'd had her out that morning on the couch with me. She seemed nervous and after a minute her jaw began to swell rapidly without warning. I remember so vividly turning to my mother teary eyed and telling her ""Look, that's not normal. I think my baby's dying."" And I was right. (Photo 4 is that moment. I took it in case I needed it for a vet appointment.)

I took her in to an appointment as soon as possible which was a week later and after examining her, the vets seeming reluctant to treat her. The vets told me she was ancient and was probably dying of old age. They made me feel like I was crazy for thinking it was anything else but I didn't faulter. Instead of giving in I ran over 5 blood tests through the course of her treatment. The first one came back and showed she was extremely septic with a white blood cell count of 30,000 and needed some sort of antibiotic and fast.

We trialed 3 different antibiotics over the span of 2 months. 2 shots every other day became the norm. I'm greatful for my dad, as a retired pharmacy tech he saved me countless amounts of expensive shot visits every week. He pushed aside his fear of snakes for me and helped me give her shots at home.  $1,500 and nearly 30 shots later we were told she most likely had a stomach ulcer from the rat that lead to a chronic infection in her jaw, hence the swelling.

A month later dried blood in her stool seemed to prove this theory correct. She's much better now and fully recovered. (Final photo) It keeps me up at night sometimes just thinking what would've happened if I hadn't listened to my instincts. I feel like a horrible snake mama, I'm ashamed I didn't listen to myself sooner but I'm so glad I didn't give in and give up on my baby.

Even though she's healed, she still makes audible noises (less than before however) when stressed and still retains some water before shedding but she seems happy again. She's now shedding on a much better schedule too. I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar? Do you think it was the rat or some underlying issue from when I got her?

I chose it because of the all-in-one concept, since I do consume a bit of everything: espresso, lattes, drip coffee when I have guests, sometimes to go, etc.

In general the machine is comfortable and practical, but the espresso it produces is not convincing me.

I’ve already tried:

    •	3 different types of beans
    
    •	Various grind sizes
    
    •	Different ratios
    
    •	Changing temperature

And even so, the espresso keeps coming out sour / unpleasant (I’m not talking about “fruity acidity”, but an uncomfortable flavor that hits the tongue).

It cost me around $15,000 MXN (\~$830 USD), so it’s definitely not a cheap machine. For what it costs, I feel the espresso result is not up to the price.

The absurd but real part:

even if the machine “works”, having it gives me more mental noise than enjoyment.

Every time I use it I feel like I’m forcing something that doesn’t quite convince me, as if I were justifying the purchase instead of enjoying it.

If I return it —I don’t think the return would be unreasonable— the idea would be to keep the Amazon credit (precisely so I don’t spend it on something random) and slowly start with something separate: a decent grinder + a basic espresso machine.

I’m not a barista and I’m not looking for competition-level perfection, I just want coffee that tastes good and not feel like I’m fighting with the machine.

My question is:

is this something you inevitably run into with almost any machine?

Or am I overthinking it and the Ninja is simply “what it is” and that’s it?",4,1769400008.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

It’s creamy, coffee-forward, not overly sweet, and actually freezes correctly (which is the hard part with dairy + alcohol).

**Tips:**

* Use **strong cold brew** — weak coffee gets lost once frozen
* Don’t skip the water dilution; it helps the texture freeze right

1qn5be7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/1qn5be7/up_the_12s/,Up the 12s,"Hey fellow 12s,

I’m a Seahawks fan from Sydney, Australia. Back when I first flicked on the tv at 12 years old wanting to get into watching the NFL, Seahawks games were one of the few that were shown on free to air.

Loved the colours and the vibes and immediately became a fan. Watching the Legion of Boom dominate was incredible, though I had no idea about the rules. Vivid memories of watching their playoff runs on school buses and at school camps. None of my mates watched NFL at the time, but I didn’t care because I loved the idea and hype of American Football and it was a fun and different sport to follow and operated to intriguingly different to what Aussies consider footy.

As the LOB members began to scatter, I still kept my passion. Watching Russ grow into a star was awesome, and when I visited the US in 2017 I had to get myself a jersey, a hat, a coffee mug, and various other Seahawks merch. I wasn’t blessed with the ability to Seattle, but I’ve told myself that one day when I have enough money and time, I’ll visit the great Lumen Field and see all Seattle has to offer.

I was gutted when Russ left and our rebuild started, but geez it was still a fun time with Geno. Sad to see Pete go but it was for the best. Mike has been an amazing coach so far. JSN blossoming into a superstar and league leading receiver has been unreal (still gutted I was 1 pick away from being able to have him in Fantasy Football).

And now we’re here. I’m extremely confident we can handle our business and take down the Pats, but we gotta finish the job before we talk the talk. This playoff run has been the most excited I’ve been about the NFL playoffs in awhile. It’s been awesome to watch, and whether we win or lose on the big day, this season has been an incredible success, and extremely happy to see Sammy D shut those haters up who thought he would crumble under the pressure. What a performance from him today.

Sorry for the long paragraphs, just excited for the team and for us 12s. Hopefully knowing someone from all the way in Australia is cheering for the Hawks gets you guys even more pumped up than you already are.

This is one of the best fanbases to be a part of. Love you guys, and I’ll be cheering for the Seahawks until the day I die, no matter what happens.

what would you guys recommend? are the burps easy to hide? if not, how much time should should i book off for medical reasons? the money is quite good - i could spare a week or so - but i’m still so new here i’d hate to request too much time off.

this is kind of a lot to unpack so I'll try to make it easy to follow

my son's dad will call him Kyle (now, 39M), and I met and quickly formed a close relationship when I was just 20. we moved way too fast, and after dating for only 4 months we wanted to have a baby, after trying for what seemed like no time at all I was pregnant and already living with him at his parents house. his family was great and I loved them all and they loved me. about two months into my pregnancy with my son I started to feel very differently about the whole situation, looking back I realize it was all hormones. there was absolutely nothing he did wrong but I would get physically ill at the thought of being around him or even talking to him on the phone, I was repulsed and had no control over it and no real reason why, but I felt trapped and decided to move out right away. he tried very hard to smooth things over, but I wanted nothing to do with him. I pushed him away, but I kept him informed of all things involving my health and our unborn child. not too long after he met another woman at his job at Walmart and quickly they became serious, i didnt know any of this at the time... she was/is 20 years older than him and we will call her Jess. later in my pregnancy my hormones settled down at about 20 weeks, half way. and I tried to initiate things with him again. he then told me about Jess but I didn't think it was  too serious because it hadn't been that long and I mean I was pregnant with his child. so we had a few ""fun time"" chats and meet ups and he insured me he was ending things with her.... yet he never did. so she obviously found out and they had a huge fight. I decided I was better off without that kind of guy, but still wanted him involved with our child's life.  she was jealous and reasonably so and wanted all communication cut off I guess, so he blocked my number, this was about 1 month before my due date with my son. I went into labor 3.5 weeks early.. I couldn't get ahold of him so he missed our sons birth. I was later reprimanded by his mother for not contacting her to reach him.. but he had cut me off and none of them had reached out to me so I didn't feel it was my responsibility to go out of my way.

 (also side note Kyle had a 5yo son living out of state that he didn't get to see because he was 20hrs away living with the child's mother, he's paid child support for him and rarely ever saw him but when we were together he called him every day to say goodnight) 

Kyle came to the hospital 2 days after I delivered and met his son. but we had no communication passed that. he never reached out. and despite the fact that my son and I had moved into an apartment that just so happened to be directly across the hall in the same complex and his gf Jess's daughter who was about my age, they visited her often but never knocked on my door to ask if his son needed anything. this went on for 2.5 years. no contact. I eventually reached out to Jess to kind of start some kind of relationship with my son and his father Kyle. I still think if I had never done this, he'd have nothing to do with our son. so eventually over time of just weekends that were convenient for them and only direct communication with Jess we've established a every other weekend during the school year and every other week during the summer visitation without going through the courts, we've never established paternity, we both know without a doubt my son is Kyle's son, but he never wanted to pay child support so I didn't push it. FFwd to Today

I have never asked Kyle for any kind of support. and have never kept our son from him, we have developed a good parenting relationship, and even Jess and I get along, and I would even somewhat consider her a friend.  we sit at our son's sporting events together and everything and even chat on the phone a little linger than what's necessary and she's even offered to pick me up a coffee from Duncan on her way to pick up my son for the weekend on occasion.  

I was married and divorced in the gap of time in this story. and since my divorce I've met someone new and have been with him for about a year, well call him Mike(39M) me and my two kids have moved in with Mike. (Mike also is divorced with 3 teenage kids and pays a ton in child support and his ex is absolutely horrid.) anyway, I have started college full time and since I've decided to quit working to focus on school and finish my schooling faster to get back to work in my new career path. all this to better support my kids. it's weird for me because I have ALWAYS worked to support us. so I have had to ask Kyle to cover more of our son's expenses for school sports. he knows I am not working right now, and he is also in a better spot financially then when we met, (a master mechanic for a big company) he and Jess are obviously still together, and she is not working right now either. I have always covered my son on insurance and paid for all his expenses up till this last year when I asked for a little help with sports stuff, of which he offered to pay for half... knowing I have no income and my bf would be footing the other half, no huge deal but considering Kyle's other son is grown and his house is inherited and his income is comfortable, it's kind of difficult for me to wrap my head around. my bf says maybe I should talk to him but it's always a touchy subject. so instead I applied for cash benefits through the state.. well you all probably already know they wanted me to cooperate with child support agency so I withdrew my application for child support immediately. I did reach out to Kyle and tell him my situation in a text message because I was so nervous.  I told him about applying and canceling my application and why..  and I asked him if he was willing to help me out while I was in school with our son's expenses, essentially asking him for child support in the amount of whatever he was comfortable with, without taking it through the court system. 

Kyle has left my message on read for about a week now with absolutely no response.  no hey let me talk it over with Jess, or let me look over my finances, no nothing....

He is definitely not perfect and I get upset with him quit a lot, but overall I have a good relationship with my dad.

I hate my mom and wish she was dead.

So I started my job search maybe 6 months ago. I didn’t love my job and decided to start applying and see how the job market was. I wasn’t seriously applying and as expected just got rejections.

Then my job got very stressful very fast and I started taking my job search seriously. I called my dad crying because I was stressed. That happened only once, about 4 months ago.

He FREAKED OUT. maybe that’s understandable because if I was a parent and my kid called me crying saying they hated their job I would also be worried. But my dad apparently took it to an extreme and started tracking down every person he knows who could possibly give me a referral and shake them down for a referral for me.

So far in 4 months, not one single referral has turned into an interview. Every interview I have gotten has been from me cold applying. Every time he calls me saying talk to x and y and z and so and so, it just adds more work to my plate. I have told him this.

He even called me on Christmas Eve because he found out that a son of a friend at the party he was at worked at Amazon. He called me saying “talk to name” and he handed off the phone. I heard him saying can you talk to my daughter and give her a referral. It’s insane.

My mom says (and I don’t fully believe her because she’s also a great liar and always exaggerates everything) that my dad has been shaking down every one of her friends also, asking what they do, asking everyone at church for a referral for me, and generally making me look like a pathetic person who can’t handle a little bit of stress.

Come to this weekend. My birthday weekend. Yay. They drive to me about 6 hours and stay in a hotel. Friday we have dinner with a family friend who I am also friends with. This is fine. My dad tells me to give my phone to my mom so she can send a message to someone who gave me a referral to who lives close by so they can meet up for food. I think wtf but I don’t want to start an argument so I do it. I don’t know why she can’t do it on her own phone or why he can’t do it on his own phone. We plan to meet for coffee on Sunday.

Saturday morning they go look at houses (because they also want to move here closer to me yay 🙃) and in the afternoon we go to meet some of their friends. Supposedly these are close friends who they have known since before I was born. Surprise surprise the father and the son work for Apple I wonder why we are suddenly going to meet their friends. My dad starts talking about me and makes me sound like a materialistic bitch in front of the people he wants to ask for a referral from. (Omg she refused to drive a minivan in high school she demanded a new car. HE DROVE THE MINIVAN FOR WORK!!!) Anyway this family is honestly fine, we go for a hike and get dinner together. After we leave my mom complains (about their friends of 20+ year) calling them stupid because they took us to have an American dinner and don’t they know she only eats Chinese food.

I start an argument on the car ride back to my apartment about meeting the dude on Sunday for coffee. Why do we have to? What is the point? My mom starts yelling at me and saying I need to ask him about his job and the startup he works for so I can be ready for the interview, how will I pass the interview if I don’t know anything about the company. At this point I shut up and uh huh my way through even if I think it’s insane that all 3 of us are meeting this guy to interrogate him about my interview and how I can prepare. She says omg I need to pray (she’s also super religious which is funny because she’s literally from hell). And god will work it out. And don’t I dare quit my job.

Whatever. at this point I feel like shit because in the 6 years I’ve been out of the house I have forgotten how to deal with my mom’s moods and how to calm things down. I call my dad when they go back to the hotel and apologize for making things worse for him and he says that I know she can’t be reasoned with so I don’t need to try and don’t worry about him. We talk more about his cancer and surgery and how likely it might metastasize and he tries to reassure me and say everything will be ok.

Sunday morning they go see another house. In the afternoon we drive to the coffee shop. My mom and I go in and sit down, my dad stays with the car because he thinks people will break in and smash the windows and steal stuff if no one’s there. The guy arrives and honestly we have no a fine conversation except for my mom. She talked about how I said I feel like I’m working at a retirement home (I never said that) and I’m so tired of the work (true). He asked me how many hours I was working and I said 40 except for oncall weeks and my mom said “she picks up a phone once in a while” (that’s not what oncall is). She then says that my dad isn’t here because their friend asked them to send a package to her daughter who lives in the city and my dad went to deliver it. There is no friend and no daughter, they are made up. My dad comes in at the end and lo and behold this guy actually told my dad how to park and therefore knows my dad has not been out delivering a package but he doesn’t say anything about it.

We wrap up eventually and Guy leaves. I tell my mom there was no need to lie about my dad delivering a package and she says it’s already over and to stop blaming her (this is a threat).

We go to my apartment and have dinner. Then we go to their friends from Saturdays house and they do whatever. Then as we are driving back to my apartment my mom brings up how my bike tire air is low and I need to pump it or it will be harder to sell. This starts an argument about how they should've bought me a car immediately as soon as I moved in. That starts an argument about if they should regift a cup I got. 

They are leaving tomorrow morning. Happy birthday to me. IDK if I should go send them off in the morning.

So, out of politeness, I responded and texted back and forth with him. 

He told me he just moved to my town (I assume he knows where I lived from my cousin) and wanted to reach out to make friends. The problem is I just graduated college and moved across the country. I told him I have family members in the town still if he wanted to have more local people to connect. He kind of ignored me and continued with saying he just wants to be friends. I took his words for it and chatted some more with him (about where I work, where he works, etc.). The whole conversation took 2 HOURS because he wouldn’t stop texting until I say I need to go.

I thought that was it but then he would continue to text me EVERYDAY. I tried to slow down my response but the moment I responded to a text, he would text back right away (like considering the time zone difference, I wonder if he is ever away from his phone). He always tries to ask when I would visit home so he can take me around for coffee. One time I mentioned I want to visit Japan, and he asked me to go on a Japan trip with him. I’ve never met him so it’s crazy to me he will just suggest that. Also, when he texts me he would sends 12+ messages in a row in span of 1 minute. Even when I don’t respond, he would send more questions. I’m starting to get hints that he is chatting with me for ulterior motives than being a friend. I don’t want to be rude because he is friend of my cousin who I respected but the thought of this being something else for him is disturbing me, considering our age difference. 

Am I overreacting or is this behavior inappropriate? I definitely don’t want him to talk badly about me to my cousin so I have been trying to be polite and answer his texts (albeit 2-4 days after to create distance but he is still as persistent). How would you handle this? I’m worried that if I confront him he will turn the table on me and say he was just being nice.",0,1769398793.0,TwoXChromosomes,7,0.33,False

For the past 3 months, since October I’ve not really been able to sleep soundly. But over the past month and a half it’s to the point where I’m sleeping 4 hours a night, max - Getting up for work and performing, rinse repeat.

I either crash out early in the night from exhaustion and I’m forced awake by nightmares that have me wetting the bed with sweat, or I just lay there in the dark wide awake and unable to sleep.

I went through a breakup back in the end of summer 2025 and used Amitryptaline  as a sleep crutch for a bit to make sure I could still function, fulfill my responsibilities and work. Before I used those I was demolished and at one point went 4 days with 0 sleep and was outright delirious and borderline manic… I used the Ami’s for a few days to get back on track then stopped.

I got to a point in November where I felt really good, was making strides in the gym, consistent sleep schedule, secured a new job, went out for meals, was overall alright - December came around and I dont really know what happened, I haven’t slept more than 3-4 hours a night since early December.

My nightmares are back, on the rare occasion I get to REM sleep and awake me to a bed soaked with sweat and an insane heart rate.

I’ve tried starving myself of sleep, forcing myself through the day and then going to bed early - No joy.

No matter what, even though I might be exhausted, I just feel awake, like I can’t switch off.

I’m lay in bed at this very moment and I start work in 5 1/2 hours, on some occasions I’ve slept just 1 hour and gone through a day of work.

Hoping for some help or insight before this starts to impact my cognitive function and my ability to learn/work.

—Well, yeah...

He is interrupted.

—Don't worry, I'm not jealous. Just curious—He smiles mischievously— Although there's something else that makes me curious.

—Really?— He returns the smile

—Well, you're a cop. Control is part of you. But tell me, do you like to keep it even behind closed doors.— He barely raises his eyebrows with that smile he's had all day.

—Um, well... I'm versatile. I adapt to the other's enjoyment

Although he maintains that flirty smile. He feels a betrayal. One to the heart. That no matter how much he tries to forget. It doesn't understand attempts. It brings to his mind the images of that night. His first kiss. The clothes thrown on the road. The marks from the other day. The feelings on the surface.

—Would you like...

Tom interrupts him

—I, I'm sorry. I can't do this

—Why? Did I do something you didn't like?

—No—He looks at the ground— You're a good guy but...

—I

—Don't worry, I understand. I know what it's like to be so crazy about someone. It shows in your eyes, Tom.

—I know I should forget him, but I can't.

Lucas puts a hand on Tom's shoulder.

—Yeah, I understand. It's not easy.

—Thanks.

With this, Tom gets up from the table, leaving the money to pay there. For more. As if that would soften the fact of his ""Flight"" Anyway, he left the place, saying goodbye to Lucas with a ""bye""

Already in the car, he sat with his feet on the seat. His knees pressed to his face. And the tears wetting them. The knot in his throat intensified. As did the blood coming from his fists. He isolated himself there, in his car. Far from the whole world. Or so he thought.

I had just closed mine, so was more like recording a “best practices” for myself more than anything else. 

  
Did about 5 or 6 of these 25-30 min monologs and noted they’re getting traction.  All in all I recorded about 27 sessions ranging from 3 min to 1 hr, and then stopped.  I felt like I said all I had to say about starting and running a coffee shop.  And stopped recording or tracking it for about 3 years now. 

  
The podcast is at about 26K downloads and still gets about 50 sessions a day and has about 400 subscribers.  

  
I’m torn, I feel like obviously there’s a market for it, but I don’t monetize it and not sure what direction to take.  Happy to help people who want to open shops, but not sure what value there is to record more episodes without figuring out how to provide value to it for myself as well.

I wrote in on the advice column about how I think my bestie is using me for money… and you guys yelled at me to give you some more info so here it is 🤣

In the fall transferred to a new to me college that is near my hometown. I quickly became friends with this girl, we’ll call her Lily. I knew Lily prior to college because her mother was my high school drama coach and she lived in the next town over. Now to the story. 

The first incident that was a little sketch with Lily was when her car broke down on the side of the road; I am someone who likes to spend money, but not on myself. I felt horrible for her because she had no money for a tow truck, so I gave her $50. I told her it can count as payment for gas money for her driving me to my apartment (10 min walk) after choir sometimes. However, she didn’t use the $50 for the tow truck… her parents and bf paid for it. That was the first red flag ish, but she’s my bestie so it was fine. 

With her having no car, I kind of became the designated driver, which I didn’t mind but sometimes it felt like I was only invited to be the driver…

Other than that, Lily would constantly not want to go out to eat or for drinks because she was “broke.” Obviously I didn’t want her to be left out, so me and my other friend kind of took turns paying for her. That’s what friends do! Yet, somehow, she still had money to go to the on campus coffee store almost every day, which annoyed me. And also still had money to doordash literally every restaurant you could think of to her door. 

Side note, she also needed $15 to start a feet finder, and me being the supportive bestie, I gave it to her. 

Finally, over winter break, we had barely talked. I was kinda sad because she’s my friend we see eachother every day at school, and now she wasn’t talking to me as much. She ended up messaging me about a sweatshirt she was selling (our school name on it, she was in the process of transferring to a school 10 min away), and I said I’d take it. Used, nike sweatshirt, I told her “$20?” and she said “oh I was going to sell it for $45”. Okay, get that bag girl, but for a used sweatshirt? I might be exaggerating but that’s kinda crazy especially when going to a friend! I politely passed on the offer and a week ish later she messaged me again. She asked if I would take it for $35 because she didn’t want to go through the trouble of putting it on Facebook. Reluctantly, I told her I would take it. A week ish passes, after small talking throughout winter break, and she messages me:

“hey i'm so sorry but is there any way you could send me to $35 for that quarter zip? i need to buy my textbooks because i go back in a week. i would super appreciate it if you could and i will get it to you asap”

I don’t know how you guys talk to each other, but this is insane wording idk 😭. I obliged and gave her the money, even though she has a job, she just never works it! 

Last but not least, I became close with her various roommates. She lives in a decently big house, with 4 other roommates, one being her boyfriend, and only pays $200 a month. Well, should only pay. One of her roommates was the “owner” of the house they lived in, and he gave me some crazy info. She owed him $800+ in rent. She just hasn’t been paying him. As her bestie, I heard all the roommate complaints how she didn’t want to live there and I was on her side, until then. 

Now to today. She goes to the other school, still doesn’t have a car, but still attends our choir. Her boyfriend can’t give her a ride to choir on certain days, so I pick her up from that school. Normally I don’t care about giving rides, but she hasn’t really been talking to me and honestly is being kind of a shitty friend. She talks to me when she needs a ride, barely invites me over to hang, etc. 

Am I missing something? Am I in the wrong and over exaggerating? I love Lily sooo much, and she genuinely is a good person, but it feels like she’s using me. I hope I’m not a bad friend for posting this, maybe I need to cut her off if this is how I feel? Idek how to ask someone if they actually want to be my friend lol I feel like I’m in middle school 🫠 Any advice would help.

I suck at expressing how I feel or let alone put words together so if this sounds bad I’m sorry beforehand. 

Everything you said makes sense, and I’m happy you were able to express yourself. I think a lot of what you shared are things we already talked about in person. But, I’m truly grateful for you and for the time we spent together — you definitely weren’t just any guy to me. You were like my best friend during the time we shared, and I adored you in every way. Sometimes, things change, and as much as I wanted to be with you, I knew I had to stay true to my feelings, and my boundaries. In my head, I didn’t want to go into something having doubts. 

I don’t want to re-explain what we have already talked about in  person, but I do appreciate you acknowledging everything you wrote. It means a lot to know that you listened to what I told you and do care :p 

I’ll ALWAYS wish you the best, and I hope you continue to thrive and win!! Lastly, I’m not looking for a response either I just wanted to acknowledge & let you know what we had was very much so real. God Bless. 

———————

I expected her not to respond to the letter tbh. I really do respect the message but I guess my mind still hopes things could have been different. I realized too late. 

I’ll continue to become a better man, What do you ladies think about this situation as a whole ? :/",1,1769398329.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1qn4uge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qn4uge/how_to_reignite_your_joy_when_life_feels_like_a/,How to Reignite Your JOY When Life Feels Like a Slow Death By Routine: The PSYCHOLOGY That Actually Works,"You know that feeling when you wake up and realize you haven't actually *felt* anything in months? Not sad exactly. Just...flat. Like someone turned down the volume on your entire existence and forgot to turn it back up.

Spent way too long thinking something was broken. Turns out it wasn't. According to research from the Greater Good Science Center at Berkeley, emotional numbness is one of the most underreported symptoms of chronic stress and modern burnout. Not depressed in the clinical sense, just...existing. Going through motions. Checking boxes.

After diving deep into psychology research, neuroscience podcasts, and honestly some really good books that should've been read years ago, realized something wild: joy isn't something you lose, it's something you forget how to access. Your brain literally rewires itself based on what you pay attention to, and most of us have been paying attention to the wrong shit.

Here's what actually helped.

**Stop waiting for permission to feel good**

We've been conditioned to earn joy. Finish the project first. Lose the weight first. Get the promotion first. Then you can be happy.

Bullshit.

Dr. Laurie Santos teaches the most popular course in Yale's history called ""The Science of Well-Being"" and her research shows that our brains are terrible at predicting what will make us happy. We think achievement brings joy, but the data says otherwise. Hedonic adaptation means that promotion or relationship or whatever you're chasing will feel good for like two weeks max before you're back to baseline.

**The fix:** Give yourself permission to feel good *now*. Not when you deserve it. Not when you've earned it. Right now.

Started with this stupidly simple practice from the book ""The Happiness Trap"" by Russ Harris. He's an acceptance and commitment therapy expert and this book completely rewired how to think about emotions. Instead of chasing happiness, he teaches you to make space for all emotions while doing what matters. Sounds basic but it's genuinely life changing. The core idea is that trying to feel happy all the time is what makes us miserable. Mind bending stuff.

Start noticing small good things without dismissing them. Your coffee tastes good? Actually acknowledge it for five full seconds instead of scrolling while you drink it. Sounds dumb. Works anyway.

**Reclaim activities that have zero productivity value**

When's the last time you did something purely because it felt good? Not because it was ""self care"" or would make you better at your job or whatever. Just because.

Research from the Journal of Positive Psychology found that engaging in creative activities significantly increases positive emotions and reduces stress, even for people who claim they're ""not creative."" Your brain needs novelty and play to function properly.

Found one completely useless hobby. Zero ROI. Can't monetize it, can't optimize it, can't put it on LinkedIn. Just pure play. Literally just walking without phone and looking at weird houses in the neighborhood. Revolutionary.

**Audit your inputs like your mental health depends on it (because it does)**

Your brain is basically a prediction machine running on whatever data you feed it. If you're constantly consuming content about how the world is ending, your brain will predict that your world is also ending.

The book ""Stolen Focus"" by Johann Hari absolutely destroyed in the best way. He's an investigative journalist who spent years researching why we can't pay attention anymore. Spoiler: it's not your fault, it's by design. Social media companies literally employ attention engineers to make their platforms addictive. The book breaks down how our fragmented attention is killing our ability to feel anything deeply, including joy.

After reading it did a brutal audit. Unfollowed anyone who made you feel worse, even if their content was ""important."" Set actual boundaries with phone using app limits. Started mornings with a podcast instead of doomscrolling.

BeFreed is an AI learning app that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books to create personalized podcasts tailored to what you actually want to learn. Founded by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts, it lets you customize everything, the length (10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives), the depth, and even the voice. Want a smoky, sarcastic narrator or something calm before bed? Done. You can type in any struggle or goal, like ""help me reconnect with joy"" or ""understand emotional numbness,"" and it generates an adaptive learning plan with content from top psychology sources. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime, pause mid-episode to ask questions, or get book recommendations based on your unique challenges. It's been genuinely helpful for replacing doomscroll time with actual growth, making the commute or laundry time feel less wasted.

Speaking of podcasts, ""We Can Do Hard Things"" with Glennon Doyle became an obsession. She talks about hard stuff but in this weirdly hopeful way. The episode about joy being an act of resistance literally made tears happen in the car. Good cry though.

**Reconnect with your body (yes really)**

When you're numb, you're usually living entirely in your head. Your body is just this annoying meat vehicle you drag around.

But here's the thing: emotions are *physical* before they're mental. Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio's research shows that we feel emotions in our body first, then our brain interprets them. If you're disconnected from your body, you're disconnected from your capacity to feel anything.

Started using Insight Timer for body scan meditations. It's free, has thousands of options, and you can filter by length. The 10 minute body scans before bed helped actually notice where tension was being held and slowly start releasing it.

Also, move in ways that feel good, not punishing. Dance badly in your kitchen. Stretch while watching TV. Take stairs because it feels nice to use your legs, not because you need to burn calories.

**Create tiny moments of anticipation**

Your brain releases dopamine not just from good things, but from *anticipating* good things. This is why looking forward to vacation is sometimes better than the actual vacation.

Started planning tiny things to look forward to. Tuesday night pizza. Saturday morning farmers market. Nothing huge. Just small pockets of ""oh yeah, that's coming up.""

The book ""The Power of Moments"" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath explores why certain experiences stick with us while others fade. They argue that we can engineer meaningful moments instead of waiting for them to happen. It's basically permission to intentionally create joy instead of passively hoping it shows up. Really practical stuff about breaking scripts, elevating experiences, and connecting with others.

**Let yourself want things again**

Numbness often comes from repeatedly wanting things and not getting them, so your brain just...stops wanting. Protective mechanism that absolutely sucks.

Start small. What sounds good right now? Not what should sound good. What actually sounds good. Maybe it's taking a different route home. Maybe it's texting that friend. Maybe it's buying the fancy cheese.

Your desires matter. Your preferences matter. You don't need a reason or justification for wanting what you want.

Joy isn't this big explosive thing you have to chase. It's quiet. It's ordinary. It's noticing that the light looks pretty. It's laughing at something dumb. It's feeling excited about your plans this weekend.

You're not broken for losing it. You're human for wanting it back.",1,1769398323.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1. Bolckow, Vaughan & Co.: Coal + Iron + Steel + Lead → prestige Steel

Shipyards +10%, Military Shipyards +10%

The British No.1 company. 3 mines + prestige steel. Buff is pretty average, but when it comes to industry coverage, only New Russia can really compete.

2. Bacardi Company: Food + Glass + Wine; prestige Spirits

\+0.1 Weekly Liberty Desire for subjects, +10% Art Academies

The new dlc Cuban company. Glass industry coverage is really good. Before recent patches, few companies offer it, and most glassworks company is either single-industry or has poor secondary outputs.  Useless buff though

3. Ford Company: Automobiles + Engines +rubber → prestige Cars

Engines +15%, Automobile Factories +5%

Last patch's undisputed #1. Post-1.9.6 stats: Michigan got occupied by non-American tags 114,514 times lmao. Still one of the strongest late-game options even after nerfs. The Rubber + Automobiles combo is extremely efficient for throughput and scaling. Engine bonus is top-tier among prosperity effects. Remains a high-priority pick for industrial runs.

4. Assam Company : Tea + Wood → prestige Tea

Tea Plantations +20%

The Romania Star of the beverage world. New patch massively buffed Tobacco, so if your pop has Tea Addiction (Britain, India especially) then go for it. Otherwise default Coffee company covers more broadly. But for raw ceiling chasing? Still recommend Assam Tea.

5. Erste Brünner: Engines + Tools + Power Plants → prestige Engines

Textile mills +10%, Power Plants +10%

The one and only true god of the new patch. Undisputed #1. Prestige Engines are the single strongest prestige good (Plantations all +13%, Oil Rigs +10%, Manufacturing 3–5%). Last patch prestige engine company (F. Schichau) has useless industry coverage which kinda nerf this no.1 prestige good. Brünn's industry coverage is extremely well-rounded, particularly with the inclusion of Tooling Workshops. In previous patches, companies that provided Tooling Workshops almost always came bundled with Engines, Steel, Automobiles, or similar industries. This caused severe overlap with strong options like Ford (Engines + Automobiles) and the coal-iron-steel companies, putting tooling workshop companies in an awkward spot—neither strong enough to prioritize nor weak enough to ignore completely. Best company in the game. Must open.

6.Maples Company : Furniture + Wood → prestige luxury Furniture

\+5% Prestige, +10% Bureaucracy

Among the big three luxuries(Porcelain, luxury furniture and luxury clothes), luxury furniture has the most accessible input (Clothes need rubber, Porcelain needs lead). Wood is everywhere in North/South America + Africa — super easy to make use of. And The +10% Bureaucracy is especially useful in the current patch where Elected Bureaucrats law is forbidden under Technocracy(if you want maximize your company numbers). Solid pick.

7.Anglo-Persian Oil Company:

Oil + Power Plants → Oil +30%

Absolute legend. No notes. Super-sized Romania Star. Throughput king, must-open for ceiling. Other cultures can use mid-sized Romania Star as a substitute.

10B Britain run, 19.1 GDP per capita, SOL 42 — absolute chad.

We‘ve dissected giants, disruptors, and disasters. Now, let‘s extract the **ultimate hustle insight**: a **simple, reusable framework** you can apply to any business to see its hidden engine or fatal flaw.

This is not another case study. This is your **First-Principles Thinking Toolkit**.

**The Framework: The Two-Layer Business Dissection**
Every business operates on two interconnected layers:
1.  **The “What” Layer (The Visible Game):** The product, features, marketing, competition.
2.  **The “Why” Layer (The Hidden Game):** The **fundamental unit of value**, the **core economic or psychological driver**, and the **system designed to deliver it.**

**Winners dominate by mastering the “Why” layer and aligning the “What” layer to serve it. Losers get stuck optimizing the “What” while the “Why” changes beneath them.**

**Let‘s Apply It: A 2-Minute Business X-Ray**
Take any company and ask these two questions:

**Step 1: Identify the “Atomic Unit of Value” (The “Why”)**
*   *Ask:* “What is the **smallest, indivisible thing** the customer is truly paying for?”
*   *Examples from our series:*
    *   **Walmart/Southwest:** The lowest **cost per item/seat-mile delivered.**
    *   **Netflix:** A guaranteed, **anxiety-free hour of entertainment.**
    *   **TikTok:** A **dose of novel, validating attention.**
    *   **Salesforce:** **Business outcomes** with aligned risk (subscription).
    *   **Patagonia:** **Alignment with a belief system** (environmentalism).

**Step 2: Audit the “Delivery System” (The “How”)**
*   *Ask:* “Is every major part of the business (product, pricing, ops, culture) engineered to optimize or defend that atomic unit?”
*   *Examples:*
    *   **IKEA‘s flat-pack & DIY** optimizes for *low cost per delivered furniture.*
    *   **Duolingo‘s streaks & notifications** optimize for *daily engagement identity.*
    *   **Kodak‘s film factories** were optimized for the *chemical film* unit, blinding them to the *digital pixel* unit.

**The Inevitable Insight:**
Conflict arises when the “What” and “Why” layers are misaligned, or when a new competitor redefines the “Atomic Unit.” (See: Netflix vs. Blockbuster, Digital vs. Film).

---

**Your Turn: The “First-Principles Practitioner” Challenge**
This is the culmination of our series. To earn recognition as a **“Framework Analyst”**:

1.  **Perform a Live Dissection:** Apply the **Two-Layer Framework** to a company we *haven‘t* covered in detail.
    *   *Format:* “**Company:** [e.g., **Spotify**]
    *   **Atomic Unit of Value:** The *cost per hour of personalized, frictionless music discovery.*
    *   **Delivery System Audit:** Their algos (Discover Weekly) optimize *discovery;* the freemium model reduces *friction* to start; the podcast bet aims to increase *hours of audio consumed.* Their risk? The unit might shift to ‘*artist connection*,‘ which platforms like Bandcamp own.”

2.  **Propose a “Why” Shift:** For an existing business, propose how changing the defined “Atomic Unit” could unlock new value.
    *   *Format:* “**For a [Co-Working Space]:** Shift from selling ‘*desk-days*‘ to ‘*successful connections made between members.*‘ The delivery system would then focus on curated introductions, collaboration tools, and tracking deals done internally—not just wifi and coffee.”

**Why This Is The Final Boss:**
Mastering this turns you from a passive consumer of business news into an **active analyst.** You‘ll see opportunities and threats before they‘re headlines.

Of you and of us:  

80’s dance music  

Heavy on the synth  

Blaring from the speakers;  

Lights dazzling from  

A rotating silver ball  

Hung from the ceiling;  

A dimly lit dance floor  

Overflowing with  

Writhing bodies  

Moving energetically  

To the music’s rhythm.  

Amid the smoky room  

Of strangers dancing,  

You and I were spellbound  

In our own Universe together.  

We had fun dancing on that  

Freezing February night.  

Then we went for coffee  

After the bar closed.  

We enjoyed a fascinating  

And animated conversation  

Together, laughing and smiling.  

Your Gemini mind captivated me.  

We never were a couple  

In a serious relationship;  

We were good friends  

Enjoying each other’s company  

And having a good time.  

Decades later, I think of you  

As the anniversary  

Of your passing approaches.  

I don’t know if  

I ever told you this:  

Thank you for coming  

Into my life when  

Everything was chaotic  

And I needed an  

Understanding friend.  

Thank you for helping me  

Find the courage to  

Go on with my life,  

Despite some tragic losses  

I painfully endured alone.  

Thank you for opening  

My heart to love again.  

RIP to you (TW) my friend.  

I shall never forget

Additional background: girl A and I are good friends before we invited guy B into our group. Also girl A has a long term boyfriend C but he doesn't exercise with us usually. My bf and I are not super close with C but we have always liked him and saw him regularly as well.

Guy B is a single guy and as time went by, we started to notice guy B began to act like girl A's boyfriend and getting possessive with girl A (one time girl A and I had already completed our work out and agreed that we are done for the day, but guy B wanted to exercise more so he asked girl A to stay longer to exercise with him, and I just causally said ""oh no we are done for today"" and then guy B literally got unhappy and threw a tantrum towards A and somehow guilt tripped her enough that she gave in and kept exercising with him.)

There are many times after the four of use completed our workout, we would leave the facility and head to our cars together and I noticed that guy B would always purposely stay behind to be close to girl A and some days they would sit in one car together and chat for hours. While I didn't think much of it at first, the pattern become more frequent and apparent- they would ""flirt"" with each other during our workouts and often being playful with each other (again, my bf and I didn't think much of it at first since all of us were close friends) but it got uncomfortable overtime as we noticed more and more.

Additional background: during this time, we are also aware that girl A is having relationship problem with her boyfriend C. She would exercise with us for long hours 5-6 times a week and return home really late- we have expressed our concern to her asking oh is C okay with this? And girl A would always shrugged it off saying 'whatever'.

As a few months went by, a lot of folks in our exercise circle began to notice A and B being 'romantically' close and had asked us ""oh are they together"" not knowing that A already has a boyfriend. Whenever being asked, I had always backed up and defended girl A saying 'oh no she has a boyfriend '. (I also answered that way at the time thinking/believing that A is just being friendly and she's oblivious of the situation) But as time went on, my bf and I also began to feel uncomfortable of how these two would act around each other knowing that A is NOT single.

Eventually one day, I had called guy B up and I had asked him 'hey do you have feelings that's beyond a friend for A"" and he was being ambiguous/avoidant and dodging my question left and right and said ""idk"" . So I reminded him, ""it's not right to act on these feelings towards A if you do have romantic feelings for her. It doesn't matter if she's having relationship problem right now, out of respect for her relationship and her partner and the friendship of this group , you should not do such things"" (basically I told him to not be a home wrecker even if that home is kinda wrecked on its own already) and I thought he understood- he did not.

Few weeks later, guy B threw another tantrum during our exercise time such that he walked out of the facility and we had called him to see what's going on telling him to come back and things got awkward in the group after that. He tried to make it up by making us pasta and dropping it off at my place and girl A's place (whom she shared a home with her boyfriend C) at the porch. And at that point girl A's bf C had caught onto something and had told girl A that how weird it is and trust that she won't do anything stupid.

Few days later, girl A called me and my bf late at night and she spilled the tea. Essentially she told us that there were multiple instances where she would randomly 'run into' guy B at random places but she didn't think of it much at first. She said one time during exercise, she had mentioned to guy B that she was heading to Walmart later during the day but did not say specific hours. That day she had gone home, ran some errands and then she went to Walmart . As she was Walmart doing her shopping, she said she had ran into B. And she also said one time after she had eaten lunch with the group, she said bye and went to get gas on the way home and she got a text from B asking her to go get coffee (just the two of them) and as she got the text she saw guy B driving by the gas station that she was at and this gas station was out of the way from B's path to go home- A said she got the chills and told him no I am already on the way home and B still insisted asking ""oh really?"" Girl A did not end up going to coffee with him and went home as planned. (She said she thinks that B had tracked her location to the gas station knowing that she wasn't far away from the restaurant where four of us ate together). Girl A showed us a few more evidence that guy B might be stalking her and definitely acting possessive of her. At that moment, we told girl A we are ready to cut off guy B once she talks to B himself about his problematic behavior. So the next day, A called B to confront him and told him the way he acts makes her uncomfortable and that she no longer wants to exercise with him 1 on 1 etc. So we ended up cutting B off completely as well since I am someone who's very protective over my friends and I carry very strong moral boundaries and cannot stand being friends with someone who have no respect for others' relationships. (also I am fully aware that this whole time, I did not put any blame on my girl friend A as I fully had believed that she's innocent but that might not be the case..)

A month or 2 went by, my bf and I noticed that A and B are exercising together again in a group setting.. So I reached out to my friend A asking what's up out of concern and she said that she had talked it out with B and things are ""fine"" now- she said she just want to keep things neutral with B and she set her boundary by telling him she doesn't want to chat with him 1to1 but she doesn't mind exercising with him if he happens to be in a group setting with others because she doesn't want to make it awkward for others. I felt like her response was valid and I told her I respect her decision but I would remain my boundary with B since what he did still did not sit right with me so I do not want to engage with B.

A few more months went by and during this time, girl A is working through some relationship problems with her BF C and they ended up breaking up after being together for almost a decade. Few weeks before the breakup, my bf had ran into B at the break room of the exercise facility and B stopped my bf and told him that 'you know it was never one sided right' and went on about how girl A is afraid to tell me the truth because of how I might react. Furthermore B mentioned to my bf how A had actually went to his place and cried and apologized for messing up and making him the bad guy of getting cut off etc... (which I wasn't sure if i should believe what B had told my bf) At that time I did not ask A about what B had said to my bf because just a week prior, A had told me explicitly that she never liked B like that it was just that B happened to  be around to sit there and just listen to her (which she wasn't able to get from her partner at home). I am fully aware of what B had told my bf vs what A had told me are conflicting information (A liked B romantically vs A did not like B romantically  when A was very much still in a relationship) and few of my other friends have reminded me that maybe A isn't as oblivious/innocent as she seems- B wouldn't have made the advances if he didn't see an opportunity that was possibly opened up by A and it's a possibility that A perhaps indeed did not have romantic feelings for B but she did enjoyed the attention she was getting from B that she wasn't getting from her own partner C at the time.

Fast forward to now which is few weeks after A's breakup with her long term partner, we began to notice that 1. A has been very distant /avoidant with me (which I understand that she's going through a breakup and needs her own space but I feel like it might be more than that) 2. A and B are being playful/flirtatious during exercise but  this time 1-1. As A's friend, it confused me that we had showed up/supported her and went as far as cutting B off based on what she had told us but she ended up just going back to him like nothing had happened- reconnects with B, gets close again, and possibly even dating him now (merely just a few weeks after her long term relationship breakup), and doesn't proactively talk to us about it. While she has every right to choose who she dates/spends time without justification to me, I can't help but feel confused, invalidated and lowkey betrayed.? In a way, I am feeling my loyalty to A was unacknowledged and also a lack of transparency from my friend A and I am not sure how to process these feelings. I am almost at a point where I am not sure how to continue this friendship with A or is this whole time I am just over estimating the importance of my friendship with A.

They knew they were in this together and the nearest people were hundreds of miles away on St. Lawrence Island, maybe closer or something. They made some flags, although in the end they didn't know which one to use at all. So all three became used.

  
They had a system of democracy where everyone would vote as a council on what to do and how to survive. People were assigned roles like fishing, trying to do agriculture, making plans for survival, repairing ships, and so on. This allowed them to remain stable for a good period of time, being recorded as thriving by 2059. Once society begun to reconnect under Ecopolis or whatever they called it though, they took their boats and supplies and left. But, they were often friendly! A woman named Tanana took them in for coffee and food.

Nome (or what little remained) would be used as a seasonal dock/whaling station, and a lighthouse would be constructed later that year. Eventually it would be rebuilt by Japanese settlers, but that's a tale for the far future.""",8,1769397507.0,EmptyContinents,1,0.91,False

We’re trying to balance it feeling adventurous and exciting while avoiding travelling every other day (I’ve tried to break out whole travel days from the itinerary to be realistic). We’re happy to take flights and pay more to get to places quicker/easier.  
  
We really want to fit a short, easy/mod 2 day hike in. We love nature; mountains, rainforests, beaches etc. We love being adventurous with food and we love seeing stuff off the beaten track (but know we might not have time). We’re going to really try to brush up our Spanish.

Here are our rough plans: 

2 days flight to Cartegena, landing at night   
3 days Cartegena   
1 travel day Cartegena > Minca  
2 days Minca   
2 days Tayrona  
1 travel day Tayrona > Santa Marta > Bucaramanga   
1 day Barichara   
2 days Chicamocha Canyon Hike (incl bus back to Bucaramanga)  
3 days Medellin (incl early flight from Bucaramanga and Guatape day trip)  
1 travel day to Salento/ Coffee Regions  
2 days Salento/ Coffee Regions  
1 travel day to Bogota  
2 days Bogota   
1 day fly home 

  
Have we missed anywhere you recommend? Do we have too many/ too few days in places?

We’ve already sacrificed Jardin, San Gil, San Andres and the Tatacoa Dessert for efficiency. The Amazon also seems unrealistic given our timings. But again, we’re open to suggestions! 

Any and all advice is appreciated, thanks so much everyone :)

Welcome to the new age of roleplaying!

Live-generate starting messages (no more fixed, repetitive roleplays), make your characters assertive and realistic, improve the overal LLM writing quality through auto-injected instructions mid-roleplay (OOC on steroids) - even for smaller and ""stupid"" models. No custom extensions in SillyTavern required. Everything works through simple, well-organized and internally labeled lorebooks - one embedded in a character card, two framework ones on your lorebooks list and that's it. It is as easy as it gets. It is the 5th edition, I've been developing this system for last 2 years already - so it is quite polished and from now on, I will release only the incremental upgrades.

You may use it to diversify the experience or you can convert your character cards to the SX-5 format to unlock its full potential - which is very fun, powerful and worth your time but optional! Everything is triggered from a normal chat window - so not additional menus that usually come with extensions. Here - everything works in a vanilla SillyTavern and the functionalities actually make any similar extension obsolete.

# What is included?

* Framework Lorebook - to activate the environment in SillyTavern (just import and activate it - it includes all the scenarios, locations, weather & time variables, anything used to generate the starting messages based on pre-written instructions);
* QoL Lorebook - to improve the LLM writing quality and to activate other, useful tricks (it improves narrative styles of the LLM, provides situational instructions you may want to use mid-roleplay (OOC on steroids) and allows general character control);
* Character Lorebook (Male/Female) - to embed in a character card in SillyTavern (this is for creating SX-5 characters)

That's all - just activate two lorebooks and use it or convert/generate characters in SX-5 format when you want to use a full power of the SX-5 roleplaying environment.

# Extra Lorebooks (fully optional)

* Sex Booster - better, more active and assertive characters in NSFW scenes (FEMALE & TS FEMALE CHARACTERS ONLY, AT LEAST FOR NOW);
* TTRPG mode - you are the Game Master/Game Mistress and the LLM becomes the player in a world you control - role reversal of sorts;
* Year Zero Engine & Powered by the Apocalypse TTRPG system lorebooks - to roll dice and use those systems in your roleplays;
* Simple Events Injector/DC Dice Rolling Mechanism (DC: check/RNG: check - to determine if current action worked/failed or to introduce random opportunities/complications)
* Sphiratrioth's Boutique - a fun system to make your characters wear different outfits each roleplay (it is all auto-rolled and adjusted to make sense/match - FEMALE CHARACTER ONLY, AT LEAST FOR NOW)

# Extra Functionality - TRANSSEXUAL CHARACTERS GUIDANCE

LLMs have a natural problem with roleplaying transsexual characters. If character's pronouns are she/her and she's got breasts, for example, LLM always confuses private parts for transsexual characters. It's obvious and logical - since LLMs operate on trained conversations and tokens probability - so they default to male-female sexual interactions. It is super frustrating for those who like roleplaying with transsexual characters. Because you all asked for it - I decided to do something about it - and here it is. Reportedly, I succeeded - there are instructions inserted at low depth, which remind the LLM that a character is transsexual aka it has specific body parts and specific actions are possible with that character sexually. You need to activate a proper entry within the embedded character lorebook to make it work. Read further to understand what it actually means and how it works. It's super simple, I promise.

1qn4569,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adsense/comments/1qn4569/adsense_approved_6_people_in_3_days_rejected/,Adsense approved 6 people in 3 days. Rejected someone 43 times. I tracked why?,"I've been on this sub long enough to notice something weird. Some sites get approved with 6 AI articles in 3 days. Others get rejected 43 times for the same reason.

Genuinely tried to understand why. So I tracked every approval and rejection post I could find.

Here's what I found:

**The contradictions driving everyone crazy:**

One person gets approved with 6 AI articles in 3 days. Another gets rejected for ""low value content"" with 26 hand-written blogs at 1500+ words each.

Someone applied after 1 week and got in. Someone else waited 6 months and still got rejected.

No wonder people keep saying ""AdSense is a lottery.""

But it's not random. There's a pattern.

**What actually separated approvals from rejections:**

|Approved|Rejected repeatedly|
|:-|:-|
|Privacy policy matched actual tracking|Said ""we don't track"" but used GA cookies|
|Kept publishing during review|Stopped and waited|
|Legal pages in footer|Legal pages in main menu|
|One focused niche|Scattered topics|
|Tool site + supporting blog|Tool only, no written content|
|No competing monetization|Patreon, Buy Me Coffee, donation links everywhere|

**Actual stuff nobody talks about...**

1. **The privacy/analytics mismatch**: One guy got rejected 15 times. Asked Gemini to review his code. It found his privacy policy said ""we don't track anything"" but he was using Google Analytics cookies. Fixed it. Approved next try.
2. **YMYL is a silent killer:** Saw someone with a wellness/finance blog get destroyed in comments. Writing about money and health without CPA or medical credentials? Google won't touch you. Doesn't matter how good the content is.
3. **Longer review is actually good**: Fast rejections are automated. If you're waiting 10-17 days, you passed the bot checks. Most approvals I tracked came after long waits.
4. **Premature monetization looks desperate**: One site had ""we use Google AdSense"" in their privacy policy BEFORE getting approved. Patreon links on every page. Buy Me Coffee in sidebar. Screams ""please give me money"" before proving value.
5. **AI content is a coinflip**: I've seen sites approved with pure AI content and sites rejected with hand-written articles. The difference seems to be whether the AI content actually answers questions people are searching for or just fills space.

**The formula that keeps working:**

    Focused niche + supporting content + consistent publishing + no monetization desperation + privacy policy that matches your actual tracking

Notice what's NOT in that formula:

* Specific word count
* Specific number of articles
* Domain age
* Traffic numbers

I've seen approvals with 4 pages and rejections with 700 pages. The pattern isn't volume. It's coherence.

**What I'm still figuring out:**

The YMYL thing is tricky. Some people say they got approved with health/finance content no problem. Others get rejected instantly. Credentials seem to matter but I can't prove it yet.

Same with AI content. The ""it depends"" answer isn't helpful but that's where the data points.

I've been compiling all of this into a checklist to track what actually matters vs what's just noise.

>Still adding to it but here's where it is, for curious cats: [\[adsense approval to profit\]](https://webmatrices.com/checklist/adsense-approval-to-profit)

Tried a bunch of apps, but Keytom (that Dubai-based financial app) caught my eye for its all-in-one setup: named EUR IBAN for SEPA transfers, virtual cards on Google Pay/Apple Pay, and a built-in crypto wallet supporting BTC, ETH, USDC right out of the gate.

Onboarding was a breeze - just 48 hours with basic KYC (passport + utility bill), no endless paperwork even from non-EU spots like LATAM or Asia. They cover businesses from 120+ countries, which is huge for remote teams. Deposited USDC from a recent NFT consulting payout, swapped to EUR at spot rates (no hidden spreads I could spot), topped up the virtual card, and spent instantly on everyday stuff - Amazon orders, Google Ads, even coffee runs. Works seamlessly in 100+ countries, with global payouts to suppliers or freelancers.

**A few real-world perks I noticed:**

* Instant crypto-to-fiat ramps without waiting for blockchain confirmations eating into your day.
* Multi-currency holds (EUR, USD, etc.) so no constant conversions for international clients.
* Business tier lets you issue cards to team members for expense tracking - tried with a VA, super clean.

Not perfect - no yield farming on holdings yet, and crypto selection is focused (BTC/ETH/USDC for now). But for anyone tired of juggling Bybit for crypto, Wise for fiat, and Revolut for cards, Keytom streamlines it into one dashboard. Solid 8/10 for my workflow.

I wasn’t looking for anything in particular but it was out of curiosity that I started talking to this guy. I knew he was much older and I was always expecting him to be the same kind of older man that’s on tinder, just looking for attention from a younger woman. He was always respectful and straightforward. Physically he doesn’t appear to be much older maybe 27-30. He doesn’t have kids nor was he ever married. He’s extremely responsible as well. From what I understand he’s also a homebody and he’s never been the type to do casual things. He’s only had 4 girlfriends in his lifetime and there seems to be no pattern with dating women my age or even a lot younger than him. They’d always been 26-40. 

We started texting over the next couple weeks and eventually started calling each other frequently to the point where we were having real conversations for hours on hours. 

Then we had met up for a coffee and we’ve continued seeing each other like this. Eventually things escalated and our relationship became physically intimate.I feel like we’re compatible in so many ways in terms of values, ideas, and goals. Even physically we’re so compatible and from what i understand that’s really rare to find. I feel like if I was older or maybe if he was younger we would have been perfect for each other. We’ve had this conversation so many times before that I’m also still too young to know for sure this is what I want and that I need to continue with my studies and my career. He’s told me too that he’s ready to have kids and a family and settle down with someone. But he’s been looking for the right person to do it with. But that it’s unfair to expect me to already be thinking about these kinds of things. 

In a way it’s true because I feel like I would need to grow up a lot faster if I commit to something real with him. I know I could be losing my youth and that’s not something I can get back. But I do ultimately want the same things as him. I want to have a family and have the same kind of home life I had growing up. it’s always been important to me but I’m not willing to give up my career for it. Especially as a woman. He understands that and he’s been really helpful in guiding me through my career and education. It’s been a big help for me. 

I think that he would wait for me but then it’s like i’m being put on a clock until I’m ready to have a family and settle down. 

I know that I might be too young to know any better. But it’s so strange because of the level of connection I feel with him. Things feel intense and real. I’d had relationships with older guys before but they’d always felt like power dynamics. ",0,1769396184.0,Advice,5,0.5,False

Freshman year before they became friends j actually took this girl to hoco. We hit it off, nothing really romantic, just friends.

First of all, posting this on a throwaway account because I have some very identifiable information on my main, and I don't want this tracked back to me for now, but I have to get this story out, careful, it's going to be a long one. 

So, my (37 F) now-ex (40 M), let's call him Bill, and I fell in love got married about 9 years ago. We had a modest but beautiful ceremony, and the marriage itself was mostly decent, until the end. We had an open marriage, with stipulations...

\- No one from our immediate social circle  
\- No one from our immediate professional circles (a.k.a. no coworkers)  
\- And before anything happened with anyone, we would have a conversation about the person and we could veto each other's potential partners for any reason

We had kept our finances mainly seperate, but we would ask and send money to each other freely (mainly I would be the one supporting Bill), but we were in debt, both of us had maxxed our credit cards, overdrawn our debit accounts, and had multiple bank loans. Majority of these debts were incurred trying to keep Bill's business afloat. 

I had a steady income from my parents close to 3x Minimum Wage monthly, which I was supplementing with a part time job, but since the debt was out of control, I found a full time job where I was making 2x Minimum Wage, meaning I was pulling close to 5x Minimum Wage monthly, just by myself, meanwhile Bill's business was still struggling. 

The only issue, the new job was quite the commute from our house... which I decided to essentially cut in half by staying at my parent's house 6 days a week and go back home on my days off, once a week. Bill ran his business out of our garage, so he essentially worked from home, and since it was his business, he could essentially give himself a day off when I had a day off. We managed.

He would of course socialize and invite his friends over when I was staying with my parents, and since we had a guest bedroom, sometimes those friends would sleep over. 

One such friend was a girl, let's call her Agatha (25 F), who had worked for Bill before, and even helped out after during busy seasons. Bill treated her like a little sister, and Agatha treated Bill like an older brother. So I wasn't really suspicious at first when she started sleeping over at our house. But as time passed, I grew more and more suspicious.

So I did what a reasonable adult in my position would do: I flat out asked Bill if there was anything going on between him and Agatha. He said there wasn't. I told him, I'll take him on his word, and that I wouldn't try to ""catch him"", either with her or in a lie. Then he asked me what would happen if there was something that had happened, and I told him ""If there was anything going on between you two, it would mean you went against all three of the rules we agreed to, and you would have to stop seeing her immediately, and we would need to go couples therapy."" Bill then asked ""What would happen if I didn't want to stop seeing her?"" and I said ""Then we would be getting a divorce"". I didn't see the red flags in him asking all these hypotheticals at the time, so as soon as we wrapped up the conversation I went to sleep because I was dead tired from the night shift. 

I woke up to Bill sitting at the foot of the bed, crying. As soon as I woke up he said that it was ""confession time"" and told me everything. That Bill and Agatha had been having an affair in my home, in my bed for a month now... that he didn't want to stop seeing her, because she made him feel good about himself. I reiterated that if he didn't want to stop seeing her, then we would need to get a divorce, so he asked if he could think about it and I said, sure, take your time. 

We then had a regular evening, had dinner, watched a movie, and Bill went to bed. The next morning as we were having our morning coffee he told me that he had made up his mind, that I was his life-partner, and that he was all in. We had a nice morning, then I went to bed, to sleep before my next night shift. 

When I woke up Bill wasn't home, so I called him, he said he was at his brother's having a chat with his brother and their father, and to not wait for him, as he would be coming home late, so when I had to leave for work, I did. At work I gave him another call and asked him how it went with his brother and father, and he told me that they talked about the Agatha situation, and that he had decided he wanted a divorce. 

I'm not exactly proud of my initial reaction, I basically laid into him for doing this to me while I was at work, over the phone, and not face to face. After a bit I calmed down, and told him that he essentially changed his mind three times over the course of a little over 24 hours, first he needed more time to decide, then he was all in, and then he wanted a divorce. I told him there is no possible way for any decision he makes now to be a healthy one, as he was clearly in some sort of crisis, that I wanted him to make an appointment with a therapist first thing in the morning for individual therapy and I wanted to start couples therapy very soon after that. He said that he had made up his mind, there was no changing it, and that he was afraid that he would be giving me hope if he agreed to it. I told him that if I get my hopes up, it would be on me and not him, and in order to make sure this is the right path forward he needed individual therapy and we needed couples therapy. 

He put off getting an appointment for individual therapy for about two weeks, which gave me more than enough time to re-evaluate our marriage and get a sense of how ""I"" actually felt about getting a divorce. And for me it all changed when as a thought exercise I imagined what life as a divorcee would be like for me. I realized I would have more peace of mind by myself as a single woman than I ever did, being married to him. That essentially I was trying to convince him that I was worthy of being loved, and that he was avoiding me like the plague at every turn for about the past 5 years or so. 

So, after he had his appointment with his therapist and she confirmed what I had been saying, that he essentially had a crisis, essentially a nervous breakdown of sorts, I told him that I had also made up my mind, and that I also wanted a divorce. 

So we did. In a matter of weeks. In less than a month after he told me that he had been cheating on me, I packed all my stuff in the house, moved it piece-meal, we filed and then we were divorced. 

On the advice of a family friend who is a divorce attorney, in order to make the process as short as possible, we had a no-fault-divorce, where neither of us asked the other for anything... and it meant all the debt I went into, in order to help his business, I was not going to get compensated for. I essentially decided that being free of Bill would be a better outcome than a lengthy divorce proceeding where I tried to squeeze him for the money he owed me, money he clearly does not have. 

I'm skipping over a lot details and conversations over this period, where he insisted that the reason we were getting divorced was not the fact that he cheated on me, or the one where I told him that he would come to regret this decision, not anytime soon, but in about 5 years time, to which he laughed. 

So I embraced my new life as a divorcee. I told my friends that I wanted nothing to do with dating for a while, and that I would make a spectacular comeback as a cougar after I turned 40. 

That is until Adam found out I was divorced. 

Adam, was an old situationship of mine from about roughly 13 years ago, when I was living in a different city. At the time, neither he nor I was interested in having a serious relationship, but we both recognized something special in each other, so we agreed to a friends-with-benefits situation, a non-monogamous one, which ended because I decided to move to the city I live in now. So we parted as friends, and kept in touch over the years, which had whittled down to sending each other a funny meme and asking how life was once every 6 months or so, especially after I got married. 

When Adam found out I was divorced, he asked if he could video call me, almost immediately. And once the pleasantries were out of the way, he started the main conversation by essentially apologizing for everything he thought was his fault with our story 13 years ago... including letting me go. 

He told me things that I had no idea of, like how his best friend was still using me as an ace up his sleeve to shut Adam up, whenever it looked like Adam was winning the debate... or that he gave up entirely on dating around when he realized he was looking for me in every woman; one because she was tan like me, one because she was tall like me, one because she had eyes similar to mine...

... and that even after all this time, that he was convinced I was his soulmate... the one that got away... and that he was still very much in love with me...

... and I told him the feeling was mutual, because it was... when Bill and I had a fight, and he would say something extremely rude or mean to me, the first thought that would float in my head would be ""Adam would have never said something like that to me, not even in a fight""... 

So we decided to give long distance a go... that was almost 4 months ago now. Everyday has been better than the last, even long distance, which we plan to end soon. We plan on getting married before the end of the year, and I'll be moving where he's living right now. 

I don't want to give too many details about Adam and I, incase Bill somehow finds this and recognizes the story. 

But I have been making ahead on the debt, I've paid off close to half of it, and should be debt-free by the beginning of summer. Adam even offered to pay it off, but I told him this was something I had to do myself, partly as my penance for falling for Bill's lies and manipulation, but mainly to prove to myself that unlike what Bill had been saying, I actually can budget, and budget well. 

There are more details in there that I could sprinkle in, but this has already gone long enough and I'm not exactly sure how to end it other than to give a TLDR:

\- was married,   
\- got cheated on,   
\- got divorced,   
\- got back together with another ex,   
\- still healing from the divorce but I am happier with my current partner than I have ever been with my ex husband. 

I think that about covers it. Thank you for your time. ",68,1769395893.0,TrueOffMyChest,22,0.82,False

I am normally (when not pregnant) a HUGE coffee/energy drink lover. I’ve cut both out since finding out I’m pregnant, but I have a one year old so I just haven’t been able to say goodbye to my daily dose of caffeine yet 😭. 

I currently drink a glass of green tea in the morning which has about 50mg of caffeine. I did some research and read green tea can block the absorption of folate, however in order for that to really happen it needs to be closer to 3 glasses a day. Yay for me! 

My question is: in the evenings I’ve been drinking honey ginger tea with zinc from Bigelow. Is this okay???? It dawned on me today maybe I shouldn’t be drinking tea with added zinc but can’t find much about it online. 

Also, if you have any caffeinated or decaffeinated teas that are pregnancy safe please drop recommendations!! I love all tea! ",1,1769395888.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False
