1jgfgpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jgfgpr/if_i_could_only_stay_asleep/,If I could only stay asleep.,"Hey everyone

I'm on my umpteenth night with no sleep, fatigue throughout the day, visually haggard, sore, irritable and yeah, not great. I have been drinking a LOT of coffee recently. Up to 8 cups a day. On purpose. And it has been a nightmare. Previously I had been caffeine free for about 3 months and sleeping like a log every single night. Feeling steady, strong and in control. 

Recently, one of my all time favorite directors passed away. David Lynch was 79 when his emphysema (amid the California fires) caught up with him. 

David was known to drink up to 20 cups of coffee a day. Of course, in light of his passing I decided to revisit my old favorite series Twin Peaks. Shortly there after I was pursing my own ""damn fine cup of coffee"" to commemorate the great auteur. 

I decided ""stuff it, if that guy can have 20 in a day and still be fully functional, I can have one. Or maybe two. and who knows... maybe a few carefully timed morning coffees will help the David Lynch magic rub off on me??""

Coffee seems to have this aura around it. This mystery. The muse of a myriad of artists, thinkers and innovators. It is the drink that brought Europe into the Age of Enlightenment. These and all of those illusive ""health benefits"" that are dangled in front of me, yet, when I succumb to the temptations and think to myself ""it'll be different this time"" I'm greeted with the same old hollow despair. 

So off I go, back to my old ways. Figuring if I have a couple of cups before 11am that's PLENTY of time for the caffeine to leave my system and give me a good nights sleep. 

Wrong. 

I basically just lay there. Shutting my eyes was little more than a token gesture of sleep. Very little rest came of it. 

So what happens next? I decide to call caffeine's bluff... spend the next several weeks drinking as much coffee as I can. Surely if you drink gallons of the stuff, you can then taper off to a couple of cups in the morning and your body will have built up some kind of tolerance?

Not so much. 

I punished my body with excessive caffeine for 3 solid weeks. Week four I decide to wind it back to 2 cups first thing in the morning. 

Still no sleep. 

I'm more anxious and irritable than I was before it seems, and no matter how tired I get, sleep seems to be merely a token gesture. 

  
This was a ridiculous experiment in hindsight. I just... really like coffee. I love the culture, the shiny machines, the morning ritual. Ever since I was a child I loved the smell of it. In my teens I learned how great you can feel from drinking it. Emboldened, inspired and living life on my own terms. Only a sip away. That was the dream.

I have been in a relationship with my bf (31M) for 2 years. I moved into his apartment 9 months ago. I have noticed a shift in our relationship ever since moving in and especially the last 4 months. Prior to us living together, my bf would always be open to doing things together, like going for walks, cafés and making dinner together. We don’t really have any shared hobbies, but it felt like that wasn’t a problem due to the fact that we always did different activities together. 

My bf loves gaming and that was never a problem for me. Prior to me moving in, he was sitting in front of the computer a couple of times a week. This changed about 4 months ago, when he started gaming daily for 8-9 hours at a time. We talk less and less and he rarely initiate to anything anymore. I would suggest going for walks which ends up with him saying he don’t want to do that or saying «only if it lasts for 5 minutes». 

I’m an introvert and love spending time by myself. I don’t mind not doing stuff together every day. I love my friends too. However, I love quality time together which I have expressed to him on three different occasions this year. He says that he will try and plan more stuff together and prioritize dating. Last month he booked a table at a restaurant, but then we don’t really hang out during the rest of the week and he never plans anything after that. I am usually the one initiating to hang out. 

He has never been a tidy person so whenever he’s gaming, I usually clean and tidy, make dinner etc. I have felt more frustrated with this due to the fact that we both work full time and I have said how much I appreciate him cleaning up after himself. He said that he would try to get better, but I have seen zero improvements. He usually tidies more for about 1-2 weeks and then it’s back to old habits. 

Prior to us living together, my bf would always shower, shave and tidy his apartment. The last six months I have noticed that he probably showers 1-2 a week and barely shave. He don’t even brush his teeth everyday. He smells bad sometimes and I feel uncomfortable when I sleep next to him at night. I feel like not having sex with him anymore due to this. I always shower before bed and put on perfume, to make him feel good. He has ADHD so I don’t know if he just forgets or needs reminders, but I feel like that is not really my job when it comes to taking care of personal hygiene.

I have asked him many times if everything’s alright and he says he’s happy in this relationship and that I make him better, but I don’t see any consistent effort or planning anymore. I have expressed to him that I don’t feel seen anymore and he says he Will do better and only game when I’m not home, but I don’t feel like he’s trying. If I don’t suggest or plan dates, we probably would never do anything. I am worried sick about the future and I’m questioning marrying him or even having kids with him which are things we have planned. I have felt super anxious for 3 weeks now and my sleeping pattern is really bad due to overthinking. I feel like I’m talking to deaf ears.

We are both usually working at different times during the week, which makes me want to make time for us at least a couple of times a week, even if it’s just drinking coffee together in the morning. My bf is going on vacation with his friends for a month starting tomorrow and I have never been more excited to spend time away from him which makes me feel bad.

I’m wondering how I’m going to communicate this to him again and if it is possible to fix it before it’s too late?

I think this is my adhd, because I have kinda always been like this, but its like my body always wants a full 12hrs of sleep, but im a 25 year old postgrad with things to do, so I go to bed around 10 and aim to get up for 5-6 bc of my uni schedule. I often fall right back asleep again on the sofa after I've woken up and its absolutely maddening. I try to drink coffee and that helps, but unfortunately right now im in a horrible gerd flareup (that might actually be h pylori, am testing today), so I feel permanently full and bloated, and it wasn't until after my nap I felt I could handle a cup of coffee (I didn't even have a big breakfast, literally just a homemade soft bake made from oats and banana).


For my adhd brethren, how do you keep your sleep patterns in check? Especially would like to hear how you did/do it while unmedicated. Sometimes I can make myself feel exactly the right kind of wired and healthy with caffiene, but its very hit or miss, I have no idea what the right amount of caffiene is to make this happen, it just happens sometimes, and if I go overboard I drive my anxiety through the roof.

Deepseek - Oh, INTPs—the ""absent-minded professors"" of the personality world. You know, the ones who can solve a complex theoretical physics problem in their sleep but will forget to eat for 12 hours because they were too busy debating whether a hot dog is a sandwich. You guys are like walking encyclopedias, except the encyclopedia is missing a few pages because you got distracted halfway through reading it.

You’re the type to spend 3 hours researching the *perfect* coffee maker, only to realize you don’t even drink coffee. And let’s not even get started on your love for hypotheticals. ""What if humans had gills?"" ""What if gravity just stopped for 5 seconds?"" Meanwhile, you’re standing in the grocery store staring at the cereal aisle like it’s a Rubik’s Cube because decision-making is your kryptonite.

And socializing? Oh, that’s a whole other level of awkward. You’ll either dominate the conversation with a 45-minute monologue about the history of paperclips, or you’ll ghost everyone for weeks because ""recharging your social battery"" somehow requires the same amount of time as a NASA Mars mission.

But hey, at least you’re self-aware. You know you’re a walking paradox: a genius who can’t figure out how to fold a fitted sheet, a visionary who can’t decide what to have for dinner, and a philosopher who overthinks *everything* except the things that actually matter. Keep being you, INTPs—just maybe set a reminder to eat once in a while.

Me - Truueee! Roast more, go nuclear

Deepseek - Oh, you want nuclear? Alright, buckle up, because we’re about to dive into the black hole of INTP absurdity. You guys are the human equivalent of a ""404 Error: File Not Found."" You’ve got all this brainpower, but half the time it’s like your operating system is running on dial-up. You’ll spend 6 hours optimizing a spreadsheet to track your *potential* productivity, only to realize you’ve accomplished absolutely nothing. Classic INTP move: planning to plan, but never actually doing.

And let’s talk about your ""projects."" You know, the ones that start with a burst of inspiration at 2 a.m. and end up abandoned in a graveyard of half-finished ideas. You’ve got a 3D printer collecting dust because you were *totally* going to revolutionize the world with custom-designed bottle openers. Spoiler: you printed one, got bored, and now it’s a $500 paperweight.

Socially, you’re a disaster wrapped in a paradox. You crave deep, meaningful connections but would rather debate the ethics of AI with a stranger on Reddit than answer a text from your best friend. And when you do show up to a social event, you’re either the quiet observer in the corner analyzing everyone’s body language or the one derailing the conversation with a 20-minute tangent about the Fermi Paradox. Spoiler: no one asked.

Oh, and your indecisiveness? Legendary. You’ll spend 45 minutes debating whether to order pizza or sushi, only to end up eating cereal because you couldn’t decide. And don’t even get me started on your ""organized chaos"" workspaces. Your desk looks like a tornado hit a library, but you swear you know where everything is—except, of course, your keys, wallet, and any sense of urgency.

But hey, at least you’re consistent. Consistently overthinking, consistently procrastinating, and consistently forgetting that the real world exists outside your head. Keep dreaming big, INTPs—just maybe set a reminder to pay your rent once in a while.

1jgfbhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jgfbhk/ro_the_limbo_of_the_bus_bench/,[RO] The Limbo of the Bus Bench,"Rain trickles down from the sky, hitting the roof that covers a bus stop bench in a simple but soothing harmony. The sun rises from the horizon, hiding behind some dark heavy clouds, it must not be a morning person. The bus stop stands in between the beginnings of an urban city and the ends of a suburban neighborhood; it sits in limbo. Heavy footsteps make light splashes in barely formed puddles. A tall young man wearing earbuds, completely unbothered by the sprinkles of rain meets at the bus stop checking the seat before sitting down. He’s wearing a heavy trench coat that drapes over the bench as he leans back maintaining his posture. He’s dressed in business wear, a dark shirt, dark pants, a tie, all the works. His clothes make him look ready for the day, and his eyes look like they're ready for retirement. The rain around him picks up, going from a sprinkle to a shower. The man pulls out his phone fiddling with it, no desire to do anything with it just a desire to fill the void of waiting. He looks through it before becoming despondent. He puts his phone away. The way he sinks down in the seat, he’s not bored, he’s distant. The echos of rain hitting an umbrella get louder and louder until an old woman in a dog fur covered sweater walks up to the bus stop. She struggles to balance holding a bouquet of flowers with closing an umbrella while also trying to sit down. The young man glances towards her direction, before going back to minding his business. The old woman’s hope of help fades before she decides to just place the flowers on the bench so she can close the umbrella without doing a circus act. She then leans the umbrella up against the bench, and grabs the flowers, moving them out of the way so she can sit down. After getting comfortable she lays the flowers on her lap. Looking towards the young man she smiles slightly before trying to start some small talk.

“Some weather we’re having.”

The man pulls out an earbud.

“...What? Are you talking to me...?”

“Oh, um yes I said some weather we’re having.”

“Yeah...”

The man's eyes dart between the view in front of him and the old lady, he has a look of confusion as to why she is talking to him, a look which is soaked in a mild disgust.  The old woman’s smile has now been replaced with a look of unsureness. The man starts to put his earbud back in, but the old woman wanting to have a nice conversation with someone tries to keep talking to him.

“What’s your name?”

The man continues to put his earbud in and quickly spits out.

“Richard.”

He turns away from the old woman completely, engrossed with what he’s listening too. The woman’s face goes from unsureness to embarrassment. A silence grows between them, a silence that wasn’t deafening, but instead death-ening. The sound of rain going from a showering to a pounding replaces the silence. The once little puddles of water now look more like ponds. The smell of car exhaust fills the air and the sound of rain is accompanied by the low rumbling of an engine. The first bus of the day was pulling up to the bus stop. It slows down only causing ripples in the water instead of tsunamis. And to the old woman's relief the man stood up and stepped onto the bus, which to her was such a god send it would inspire an atheist to become the pope. The bus closed it’s door and left as quickly as it arrived. The rumbling of the engine was slowly replaced by the song of soothing rain, and the smell of exhaust faded into the comforting smell of wet asphalt. The old woman didn’t sit alone for long as a shorter man ran towards the bus stop replacing the one that just left. Unlike the bus this man was creating tsunamis in the puddles. Splashes so big that any nearby ant would be smart to run for the tree trunks to gain higher ground. The man made it to the bus stop grabbing one of the poles supporting the cover, and using it to swing into one of the seats, crashing into the back of the bench so hard that it would’ve noticeably hurt anyone else, but the man was too distracted by how out of breath he was to care. He sits a little disheveled on the bench hunched over trying to catch his breath. The old woman still determined to have a conversation with someone speaks up in a light hearted tone.

“Late for something?”

The man laughs.

“Nope, just trying to get out of the rain.”

The man sits up, running his hand through his drenched hair. 
His fingers catch waves of water that fall down his mid length unkempt hair. Actually, all of him is unkempt, his attempt at business appropriate clothes being... well an attempt. His tucked in button up shirt was poking out of his pants, his tie wasn’t tight enough, and unfortunately his zipper was down, and while you wouldn’t be able to see it because his pants were too long his socks didn’t match. None of that seems to bother him though, even soaked to the bone he still had a smile on his face. He fully turns towards the old woman before speaking.
“I guess I should have brought an umbrella, or checked the weather app, at least then I’d be a little prepared to run.”
The guy cracked a small smile and the old woman chuckled a little bit.

“Trust me no matter how many times you prepare yourself there is nothing like when it actually happens, learning to go with the flow is a much better skill to have.”

“Well, it looks like I have that part down.”

The 2 chuckle before the man starts to speak again.

“I’m Jake, what’s your name?”

“Penelope.”

“If you don’t mind me asking, Penelope, what are the flowers for, are you celebrating something?”

The woman chuckles to herself, a sense of dreadful irony hidden in her eyes.

“You could say that. I’m going to my late husband’s grave.”

“Oh!.. I’m- I’m so s-sorry.”

“Please, don’t be. You are right, I am celebrating him, specifically the day he died. I visit him often but I like to save the flowers for special occasions.”
She chuckles, before leading into a sigh. There’s a sense of bittersweet sorrow in her eyes. Jake speaks before really thinking.

“You must feel sad.”

“Well, it’s been years, and the longer it’s been the less sad I feel and honestly the more pride I feel.”

“Pride?”

“Oh yes. You see my dear Sal loved dogs, up until the day the grim reaper came for a visit, so he made me promise that I would use his retirement savings to open a shelter, which is exactly what I did. And now so many dogs are off the street because of him, and with every new dog we save I get to see a little bit more of my husband's kindness in the world. I also try not worry as Sal was a religious man so I know that he ended up in whatever heaven he believed in.”

“Are you... religious?”

“Not as much as Sal was. Back in my youth, which to you probably feels like centuries ago, I was really only ever religious because there really wasn’t another option, it felt like something you had to do, and after I met Sal that didn’t change. I remember when we used to have little bickers over breakfast on the conversation of God and what not, they were never too serious luckily, Sal was a very reasonable man. But even when he fell sick, I still did not pray. I would hold Sal’s hand in the hospital as the cancer grew, but I would never hold my hands together for God. It was only after the love of my life past that I started believing, but not for my comfort, for his. I don’t believe in an afterlife for me, I believe in one for him because he is the most kind man I have ever met and he is one of the only people who truly deserves his own heaven.”

“How did you ever move on?”

The woman chuckles.

“I didn’t. I meant it when I said he was the love of my life, I never dated anyone after him, ironically against his wishes. He so wanted me to be happy that I wouldn’t be surprised if he wasn’t praying for his health, if instead he was praying for me to find a great man, but little does he know I had already found the perfect one.”

“...Do you regret it.”

“No, I’d rather have found the love of my life and loved him for the rest of his time, than found a man I only liked and been with him for the rest of my time.”

“That’s really wise.”

“Comes with the age.”

The 2 laugh once more.

“Enough about me, tell me Jake, where are you going?”

“I’m heading into work, in clothes so drenched I’ll never here the end of it from Richard- he's my manager.”

“Richard, you say, I think I might’ve seen him earlier, tall, dark clothes, a bit of a... um...”

“He lives up to the nick name.”

“Couldn’t have put it better myself.”

“Yeah, he can be so... difficult to just be around, there’s a reason I wasn’t here earlier. The first time I had to wait for the bus with him he just sat there ignoring me. He acted like even just looking at me would... melt him.”

“Yes, I had a very similar experience.”

“I think the guy just hates people. He has no pictures of anyone on his desk at work.”

“Hmm pretty ironic, typically misery loves company, but it seems this man is miserable because of no company... Oh, sorry, as an old lady I should know better than to speculate.”
The young man laughs amused.

“You're not wrong though. Miserable is a good word to describe him, actually it’s a good word to describe that whole place. I don’t even know why I work there, it’s full of miserable people.” 

“Then don’t work there.”

“Wouldn’t that be nice.”

“I’m being serious.”

“Oh, well it’s not like I can just stop, I mean you can’t just quit your job. I have responsibilities, and nowhere else to work, at least nowhere that pays as well.”

“Well, it is your decision to make, at some point in life you just have to choose to either be happy for a little while, or just ok for the rest of your life. I picked being happy myself, and when that ended, I built a shelter.”

“...Yeah, I guess you're right.”

“Haha, I’m glad it only took 83 years to be right about something.”
The man laughs along with the woman, before the sound is slowly consumed by the noise of a new bus pulling up to the bus stop. The woman stands up making sure to grab her umbrella.

“This is me. Thank you for the conversation.”

“Of course, you did make it fairly easy after all.”

The woman smiles softly.

“I can’t wait to tell Sal about you, he’ll be delighted to know of our conversation.”

“Maybe he’ll put in a good word for me with the big man upstairs.”

Penelope laughs for a last time before entering on the bus and disappearing with it into the rain. The once sound of an intriguing conversation goes back to the comfort of rain. Jake leans back into the bench going over the conversation he just had, contemplating, mourning, and relishing, in all of what the woman said. All while he stares off into the distance. A familiar sound of rain beating down an umbrella is accompanied by the sound of high heel boots hitting the sidewalk. A lady makes her way up to the bus stop. She’s adorned in a beautiful long black coat that is decorated in navy fur around the ends of the sleeves and collar, a pair of coffee-colored boots, and a pair of ear muffs going over her thick black hair that curls at the ends. She sits down on the bus stop bench making Jake look like the before picture in a makeover sequence, but even so that doesn’t stop Jake from smiling at her. She looks back at him and returns the smile, before opening her mouth.

“So did you forget your umbrella, or did you plan this look?”

“Oh, for someone so fashionable I would’ve thought you’d be able to tell that this was planned.”

“Oh, even the unzipped fly?”

“My flies not-”

Jake looks down.

“Crap”

The sound of a man trying to hide the fact he’s zipping up his pants is heard way louder than Jake would like to admit. The lady laughs in a flirtatious manor.

“So that part wasn’t planned but the rest of it was?”
Jake manages to joke through the embarrassment/trauma.

“See you get it.”

The 2 laugh and the lady skooches closers while Jake leans towards her a little bit more.

“So, Ms. stranger danger-”

“Call me Mary.”

“Alright, Ms. Mary, where are you headed too.”

“I’m going to the grocery store.”

“Really? If you don’t mind me asking, why are you so dressed up, is there a by chance a nice restaurant hidden away in this grocery store? Do I need to start looking in the back of freezers?”

The lady chuckles.

“No, not unless you want fresher milk. The reason I’m ‘so dressed up’ is because this is the only coat I own warm enough to wear in this weather. Believe it or not I’m actually in pajamas right now.”

Mary looks around in an overly dramatic way, checking to make sure no one was around before she lifted part of her coat to the side revealing a poka-dot t-shirt with coffee stains splattered in a way Jackson Pollok would be proud of. Jake laughs before speaking again.

“We make the perfect mess together.”
Mary laughs along. And a dreaded sound of the first bus returning soaks into the conversation like poison. Jake sighs disappointed that the bus hadn’t broken down, or that time itself hadn’t stopped for him to continue this conversation. The bus comes to a screechy stop in front of the bench. Mary breaks the painful silence.

“I’m guessing by that sigh; this bus is yours.”

“Yeah, the demands of work.”

Jake gets up, somehow getting even more wet as he crosses the gap between the bus and the bus stop. He puts his foot on the step to the bus and turns back to steal one more glimpse of Mary. He’s hesitant to get on, not because he’s trying to make a choice but because he still doesn’t realize there’s a choice to make. He puts his other foot on the bus and walks through the doors, with them closing behind him. The bus leaves and Mary is left alone. She can’t help but feel sad that the man she had just met was gone, but that’s life, happiness can only last for so long. Mary fiddles with her umbrella waiting for a handful of minutes until her bus was to get there. It’s unfortunate when these things happen. When people brought together don’t stay together, whether through, misfortune, death, or just simply when someone’s bus arrives, one person’s god send is another’s disappointment. Mary was next to leave the bench, as the now bitter sound of the bus's engine fills the road. The bus comes to it’s routine stop, when the sound of the engine is overpowered by the sound of someone running, of Jake running. Mary stands in between the bus and the bus stop unable to move as she watches the man she had just met sprint towards her. The driver gets impatient.

“In or out lady.”

“Oh, sorry.”

Mary steps out of the bus and it leaves as Jake finishes getting to Mary. Jake practically falls over; he puts his hands on his knees and pants while trying to get his words out, eventually being able to breathe properly again. He looks at Mary still holding himself up on his knees preparing to say something.

“You missed your bus.”

“Yeah, well all I’m missing is the grocery store, you’re missing work... Why?”

Jake stands up fully.

“I realized I had a choice.”

“And you chose to abandoned your bus so you could run over here in the pouring rain just so we could continue are conversation.”

“Yeah, and you made the same choice.”

“I guess I did.”

The 2 smile at each other enjoying the silence that they now had the time for. Jake begins to speak again.

“You know, I know of a really cool farmers market that’s walking distance from here.”

“You know, this umbrella is just the right size for 2 people walking to a really cool farmer's market. Also, it would be cruel for me to force you to continue to walk in the rain.”

The 2 both give a hearty laugh before squeezing together under an umbrella that is definitely made for just one person. They look both ways before crossing the street, disappearing into the rain. The only thing remaining is the bus stop bench, empty, still stuck in limbo. For an object that people go to, to get away from where they are, it itself sure doesn’t get that privilege. Instead, it stands there through the snow, the rain, the first dates, the marriages, the divorces, it stands there waiting for the bus. Waiting for the people to come so they can leave, because nothing lasts forever, especially when you're in the place that no one else wants to be, but at the very least you still get to experience it. Live a life of a thousand loves and a thousand heartbreaks or don’t live at all, the choice is yours.

Was she able to get pregnant naturally or did she struggle with infertility, like the patients she treated? I’ve been with her for 4 years, since she got her specialty. I believe she’s around my age, late 30s (max early 40s). If she struggled with infertility, I wonder how she felt when she successfully got her patients pregnant. So many unanswered questions, I wish she and I could go for coffee and chat.

Now for the past 2 years she was stay at home mom currently still doesn’t work which I have no problem but most of her time at home it’s with the phone in the hand I could sometimes say that gives more interest on her social life than on us in the past period till I found out,which I will continue…..she’s a gaming girl and I don’t have any problem with it,but apparently she shared her instagram with another guy which was playing in my absence also they started chatting in secret and after she was deleting daily the messages for me to not find out! The person it’s not in the country that we live far away in a way of saying,anyway! When I realised that it’s something wrong I took her phone to check I specify that before we where heaving the same password on the phones and was not an issue to check rarely or me or her on mine,but since that day that I took the phone she kinda panicked has a small fight and changed her password.Folowong weeks I was overthinking why and how this thing happens,and I started to be the defective between the time that I was at work and at home until I realised that are some timings when was literally typing and typing , also caught her doing selfies and I started to be worried. One day she went to walk with the little one in the park and I had the opportunity to go and check what she’s doing ( I wanna specify that we both have location open share on iPhone) and when I went exactly how I was expecting she was on video with the guy chatting with him ( also have video as proof) Now I know was not intimacy between them,but I feel she cheated.we where debating and had a lots of talks about this situation and trying to find out and gain the thrust in her words to hear from her why did she shared her personal life and thaughts like that with a random weirdo. I would never cross that line specially when now have a beautiful baby ,also I tried and offered everything that I could holidays,help at house ,parenting 50/50 or more for the last two years i even make her coffee and milk for the baby at 7 am bringing to the bed feed the little one change etc. I would give everything to understand this situation which in this moment makes me feel such a weak man because I don’t wanna end it and leave.im so dedicated to the family and create toghether a family place and buy house etc holidays,parenting,knowledge transfer and protection. She was saying was not entirely happy and that’s why happened,that happened natural and was no romantic feelings,ok I got that but why she just removed the guy and didn’t blocked him I know would not make a big difference because if she will ever feel the need of thanking with him she would do in my absence like she did for the past 3 months,which  I consider it’s a lot heaving chats nearly regularly what he made u feel that way just because was making u smile? What I was not making u smile and happy? We had every year holiday once or two times restaurants and diners at least every second week.i know a relationship can’t be pink all the time but I was there body,mind and soul,I’m a family type which protects and provides.She also specified that “love it’s not enough” which made me think WTF for real now? I have been there in any situation good or bad as man we feel also down mentally because of financial bills etc that we need to be on top of it but it have this now for me it’s a big red flag! She’s still with password and feel like she talks with him in a way but trying to fix it and fix me mentally but I dont know how! We both started gym she also wants to lose weight with other methods but the question why now and not before? Heard some rumors before to catch her in the park that was saying on one of her BF that she would meet him and after the thing that happened in the park she’s saying now that she did not said like that and how she would do it if we both have location and tell where and with who we go! Make me god believe it…I don’t wanna loose what I build until now and also not my child.i love them both to the moon! Now it’s hard for me to invest for the future cause of thrust issues,also we don’t have intimacy issues since happened we really do it good at least once a day but still comes this in my head and when I ask her randomly to show me from the account that she was speaking with him it’s not showing me and starts with little fights and contradictions!

[Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production – The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/)

https://preview.redd.it/kgmztwne61qe1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d3e8b5558889c9b3b071a0aa93ce9840f66bc8

**By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:**

Section 1.  Purpose.  The United States possesses vast mineral resources that can create jobs, fuel prosperity, and significantly reduce our reliance on foreign nations.  Transportation, infrastructure, defense capabilities, and the next generation of technology rely upon a secure, predictable, and affordable supply of minerals.  The United States was once the world’s largest producer of lucrative minerals, but overbearing Federal regulation has eroded our Nation’s mineral production.  Our national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers’ mineral production.  It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent. 

**Sec**\*\*.\*\* **2**\*\*.\*\*  **Definitions**\*\*.  For the purposes of this order:\*\*

(a)  “Mineral” means a critical mineral, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606(a)(3), as well as uranium, copper, potash, gold, and any other element, compound or material as determined by the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC).

(b)  “Mineral production” means the mining, processing, refining, and smelting of minerals, and the production of processed critical minerals and other derivative products.

(c)  The term “processed minerals” refers to minerals that have undergone the activities that occur after mineral ore is extracted from a mine up through its conversion into a metal, metal powder, or a master alloy.  These activities specifically occur beginning from the point at which ores are converted into oxide concentrates, separated into oxides, and converted into metals, metal powders, and master alloys. 

(d)  The term “derivative products” includes all goods that incorporate processed minerals as inputs.  These goods include semi-finished goods (such as semiconductor wafers, anodes, and cathodes) as well as final products (such as permanent magnets, motors, electric vehicles, batteries, smartphones, microprocessors, radar systems, wind turbines and their components, and advanced optical devices).

Sec. 3.  Priority Projects\*.\*  (a)  Within 10 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency (agency) involved in the permitting of mineral production in the United States shall provide to the Chair of the NEDC a list of all mineral production projects for which a plan of operations, a permit application, or other application for approval has been submitted to such agency.  Within 10 days of the submission of such lists, the head of each such agency shall, in coordination with the Chair of the NEDC, identify priority projects that can be immediately approved or for which permits can be immediately issued, and take all necessary or appropriate actions within the agency’s authority to expedite and issue the relevant permits or approvals.

(b)  Within 15 days of the date of this order, the Chair of the NEDC, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, shall submit to the Executive Director of the Permitting Council mineral production projects to be considered as transparency projects on the Permitting Dashboard established under section 41003 of title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, Public Law 114-94, 129 Stat. 1748.  Within 15 days of receiving the submission, the Executive Director shall publish any projects selected and establish schedules for expedited review.

(c)  The Chair of the NEDC, in consultation with relevant agencies, shall issue a request for information to solicit industry feedback on regulatory bottlenecks and other recommended strategies for expediting domestic mineral production.

Sec. 4.  Mining Act of 1872\*.\*  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chair of the NEDC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare and submit recommendations to the President for the Congress to clarify the treatment of waste rock, tailings, and mine waste disposal under the Mining Act of 1872.

Sec. 5.  Land Use for Mineral Projects\*.\*  (a)  Within 10 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall identify and provide the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs with a list of all Federal lands known to hold mineral deposits and reserves.  The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize mineral production and mining related purposes as the primary land uses in these areas, consistent with applicable law.  Land use plans under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act shall provide for mineral production and ancillary uses, and be amended or revised as necessary, to support the intent of this order.

(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Energy shall identify as many sites as possible on Federal land managed by their respective agencies that may be suitable for leasing or development pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2667, 42 U.S.C. 7256, or other applicable authorities, for the construction and operation of private commercial mineral production enterprises and provide such list to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Chair of the NEDC.  The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Energy shall prioritize including sites on such lists on which mineral production projects could be fully permitted and operational as soon as possible and have the greatest potential effect on robustness of the domestic mineral supply chain.

(c)  The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy shall enter into extended use leases as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2667 or by 42 U.S.C. 7256(a) respectively, or using any other authority they deem appropriate, with private entities to advance the installation of commercial mineral production enterprises on the lands identified pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.  The installation of such commercial mineral production enterprises may be accomplished through development and construction or via modification of existing structures to be compatible with commercial requirements.

(d)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy shall coordinate with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and the head of any other agency that provides or can provide loans, capital assistance, technical assistance, and working capital to domestic mineral production project sponsors to ensure that all private parties who enter into lease and commercial agreements under subsection (c) of this section can utilize as many favorable terms and conditions as are available under public assistance programs for these purposes, consistent with applicable law.

Sec. 6.  Accelerating Private and Public Capital Investment.  (a)  The Secretary of Defense shall utilize the National Security Capital Forum to facilitate the introduction of entities to pair private capital with commercially viable domestic mineral production projects to the maximum possible extent.

(b)  To address the national emergency declared pursuant to Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), I hereby waive the requirements of 50 U.S.C. 4533(a)(1) through (a)(6).  By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Secretary of Defense the authority of the President conferred by section 303 of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. 4533).  The Secretary of Defense may use the authority under section 303 of the DPA, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, the Chair of the NEDC, and the heads of other agencies as the Secretary of Defense deems appropriate, for the domestic production and facilitation of strategic resources the Secretary of Defense deems necessary or appropriate to advance domestic mineral production in the United States.  Further, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall add mineral production as a priority industrial capability development area for the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment Program.

(c)  Agencies that are empowered to make loans, loan guarantees, grants, equity investments, or to conclude offtake agreements to advance national security in securing vital mineral supply chains, both domestically and abroad, shall, to the extent permitted by law, take steps to rescind any policies that require an applicant to complete and submit to the agency as part of an application for such funds the disclosures that are required by Regulation S-K part 1300. 

(d)  To address the national emergency declared pursuant to Executive Order 14156, I hereby waive the requirements of 50 U.S.C. 4531(d)(1)(a)(ii), 4332(d)(1)(B), and 4533(a)(1) through (a)(6).  By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) the authority of the President conferred by sections 301, 302, and 303 of the DPA (50 U.S.C. 4531, 4532, and 4533), and the authority to implement the DPA in 50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, and 4560.  The CEO of the DFC may use the authority under sections 301, 302 and 303 of the DPA, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, the Chair of the NEDC, and the heads of other agencies as the CEO deems appropriate, for the domestic production and facilitation of strategic resources the CEO deems necessary or appropriate to advance mineral production.  The loan authority delegated by this order is limited to loans that create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic mineral production.  Loans, loan guarantees, and political risk insurance extended using the authority delegated by this subsection shall be made in accordance with the principles and guidelines outlined in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11 and OMB Circular A-129, in each case subject to such exceptions as the Director of OMB grants, and the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, as amended (2 U.S.C. 661 *et seq*.).  The CEO of the DFC, in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall adopt appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order in coordination with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.

(e)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the CEO of the DFC and the Secretary of Defense shall develop and propose a plan to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs for the DFC to use Department of Defense investment authorities (including the DPA) and the Department of Defense Office of Strategic Capital to establish a dedicated mineral and mineral production fund for domestic investments executed by the DFC.  Any such fund shall be implemented pursuant to such plan only after approval by each of the Secretary of Defense, the CEO of the DFC, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.  Pursuant to the reimbursement authorities in the Economy Act, the Secretary of Defense shall transfer to the DFC any appropriated funds from the Defense Production Act Fund or from the Office of Strategic Capital necessary to reimburse the DFC in connection with its services performed on behalf of and in coordination with the Department of Defense to implement subsection (d) of this section and this subsection.  In connection with such reimbursements, the Secretary of Defense shall direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to defer to the credit and underwriting policies of the DFC with respect to the use of such funds by the DFC.

DONALD J. TRUMP

THE WHITE HOUSE,

March 20, 2025.

# MARCH 21st 2025~Trump to Expand Critical Mineral Output Using Wartime Powers

[Trump will use wartime powers to boost US mineral production - Investment News](https://www.investmentnews.com/industry-news/trump-will-use-wartime-powers-to-boost-us-mineral-production/259785)

[President Donald Trump holds up a signed executive order at an education event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 20, 2025. Ben Curtis\/AP    ](https://preview.redd.it/sqfa70r771qe1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7c00c38eb2fc7aa5eb58ff60f7a342349fa6ce9)

President Donald Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) on Thursday aimed at immediately increasing American production of critical minerals like uranium, copper, potash and gold by invoking the Defense Production Act to expand leasing and development on federal lands.

The move is intended to help the US reduce its reliance on imports from countries like China, which dominates the industry for production and processing of many of these important materials.

The order gives Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in consultation with other executive branch agency heads, the authority to use the Defense Production Act to facilitate the advancement of domestic mineral production.

The act, which was passed in 1950 in response to production needs during the Korean War, gives the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production. Trump invoked it in 2020 at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The executive order also directs relevant department and agency heads, in coordination with the chair of the National Energy Dominance Council, to identify and expedite priority mineral production projects that can be “immediately approved” or immediately issued permits.

“It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent,” the order states.

Within 10 days, Trump calls for Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to provide a list of all federal lands “known to hold mineral deposits and reserves” and “prioritize mineral production and mining related purposes as the primary land uses in these areas, consistent with applicable law.”

The order also asks the heads of the Interior, Defense, Agriculture and Energy departments to identify “as many sites as possible” where the construction and operation of private mineral production could take place.

Trump previewed the action in his joint address to Congress earlier this month, saying, “I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.”

On Inauguration Day, Trump signed an executive order declaring a [national energy emergency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/), which said an “active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacerbated by our Nation’s diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors.”

# Challenging China

Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, applauded Trump’s move, calling ramping up American mining a “national security imperative.”

“By encouraging streamlined and transparent permitting processes, combined with financing support to counter foreign market manipulation, we can finally challenge China’s mineral extortion,” he said in a [statement](https://nma.org/2025/03/20/new-u-s-minerals-strategy-boldly-challenges-chinas-minerals-dominance/).

The US Geological Survey (USGS) [defines critical minerals](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/what-are-critical-minerals-0) as ones that are essential to a country’s economy and national security, with supply chains that are vulnerable to disruption. They include lithium, nickel, cobalt and others materials used to make batteries, electrical components and semiconductors. Those parts are prevalent in electric vehicles, cell phones and other electronics.

China holds a dominant position in the production and processing of many critical minerals.

In 2024, the US relied on China for over 50% of its imports of some critical materials, such as yttrium, bismuth, antimony, arsenic, and rare earths, [according to](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/minerals-net-import-reliance-china) the USGS.

In January, China [proposed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/tech/china-ev-tech-export-controls-intl-hnk/index.html) curbs on the export of technology and processes used to extract minerals critical for the global electric vehicle industry, including metallic, gallium, and lithium. The plan has yet to be finalized.

As part of a [barrage of measures retaliating](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/business/china-us-trade-retaliation-hnk-intl/index.html) against Trump’s broad-based 10% tariff on Chinese imports to the US, Beijing in February announced export controls on five metals and their related products, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium and molybdenum. They are critical for defense and clean energy industrial applications.

Late last year, China [banned the export](http://www.news.cn/20241203/7431c1dd4600461ca38d93ecce6af34c/c.html) of gallium, germanium, antimony and other “super hard” materials crucial to produce semiconductors and other tech, to the US, in response to US semiconductor export controls imposed by the Biden administration.

On Thursday, Trump said he would be signing a deal “very shortly” on rare earth minerals with Ukraine.

That deal was what brought Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House last month, but it wasn’t signed after his tense Oval Office meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance.

Increasing mining and refinement of critical minerals is a bipartisan goal. It was a prominent part of former President Joe Biden’s clean energy agenda, boosted by the former president’s 2022 climate law.

In 2022, Biden similarly invoked the Defense Production Act by [adding critical minerals](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/politics/biden-critical-minerals-ev-batteries-climate/index.html) to the list of items covered by the law with an aim to kickstart domestic production and mining. Biden’s administration also approved a handful of mining projects for critical minerals.

[Trump will use wartime powers to boost US mineral production - Investment News](https://www.investmentnews.com/industry-news/trump-will-use-wartime-powers-to-boost-us-mineral-production/259785)

https://preview.redd.it/gq1jox7g71qe1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3781cb8e9deee0facc2ca8b0f0f6653fd9e7afe1

President Donald Trump is invoking emergency powers to boost the ability of the US to produce critical minerals — and potentially coal — as part of a broad effort to ramp up the development of domestic natural resources and make the country less reliant on foreign imports.

An executive order signed by the president Thursday taps the Defense Production Act as part of an effort to provide financing, loans and other investment support to domestically process critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to a White House official. The US International Development Finance Corporation, working with the Department of Defense, will provide financing for new mineral production projects.

The order, which also encourages faster permitting for mining and processing projects and a directive for the Interior Department to prioritize mineral production on federal land, comes as a direct response to long-held concerns among the US and allies that China overwhelmingly controls the processing of some of the most important critical minerals.

These elements are used in a number of products from batteries to defense systems that are seen as crucial to the nation’s energy and security.

Shares of critical mineral miners in Australia and China declined on Friday. Australian lithium miner Liontown Resources Ltd. fell as much as 7.1%, while graphite producer Syrah Resources Ltd. tumbled 9.8%. China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp. and Ganfeng Lithium both fell. Some coal miners, including New Hope Corp Ltd. and Whitehaven Coal Ltd., were down nearly 4%. 

In the US, Shares of MP Materials Corp., a rare earths miner, rose as much as 4.6% in after-hours trading. Peabody Energy Corp., a coal producer, gained more than 2%.

Despite possessing some critical minerals, the US currently imports a significant amount, creating economic and security risks, according to the White House. The administration said the US is import-reliant on at least 15 critical minerals and that 70% of imports of rare earths come from China. 

The Trump administration will also coordinate with the private sector to ensure a stable and resilient domestic supply chain for critical minerals, which under the executive order includes uranium, copper, potash, gold, as well as any other element, compound, or material as determined by the chair of the National Energy Dominance Council, the White House official said. That designation could also cover coal, the official added.

Government support offers to help boost domestic production to satisfy the needs of the Defense Department and private industry amid growing concerns about shortages. China is beginning to implement export controls on materials such as germanium, gallium and antimony.

The Defense Production Act is a 1950s law that former President Harry Truman enlisted to ramp up steel production for the Korean War. Former President Joe Biden similarly invoked the law to encourage domestic production of critical minerals, adding battery materials such as lithium, nickel, graphite, cobalt and manganese to the list of items covered under the measure to help companies access $750 million in funds. He also used the law to support American production of electric heat pumps. 

Trump used the law in his first term to spur mask production during the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump teased his plans during his Joint Address to Congress earlier this month, saying he planned to take “historic action to dramatically expand production” of critical minerals and rare earths.

A House select committee on China previously recommended creating a reserve of critical minerals “to insulate American producers from price volatility” and protect against Beijing’s “weaponization of its dominance in critical mineral supply chains.”

Trump said Thursday the US will soon sign a deal on rare earths with Ukraine.

1jgf5p5,https://i.redd.it/lin4v9fx81qe1.jpeg,I replaced my BBE´s built in grinder with a Mazzer Philos,"Mainly posting this so people in my recent position, thinking about making this change, have a resource to rely on. That being said, please let me know if you have any specific questions or things i should have a look at. Has anybody else made this jump? I decided on the i200D burrs as drink filter coffee 75% of the time. Love a good espresso though, that´s why i chose the Philos as an all-purpose grinder. I definitely will get the i189D as well in the future.
I have had the Philos for three days and only used it with one type of beans: a medium dark roast from a local roaster, medium quality (7€/250g) as well, so keep that in mind.
I do think about making a more thorough comparison post when i´ve had the chance to dial in some more beans, let me know if anyone would be interested in that.
My thoughts so far:
Taste: kind of similar actually. The Philos did manage a more round and balanced flavor though. More sweetness, less bitterness, less harshness, more pleasant acidity. But no huge difference. Taste-wise, the BBE´s grinder is quite capable with medium-dark roasts. I expect this to change with lighter roasts.
Texture: you might read online that the i200D burrs produce thin, watery shots. My experience definitely differed. The shots were silky and medium-bodied, much more pleasing than with the BBE´s grinder.
Consistency: night and day. ~0,1g retention vs ~1g even with single dosing mod. Nothing more to say. Most of the frustration of inconsistent dialing in is just gone.
Would i recommend the change so far? Definitely, if you have the money. 1000€ is a lot of money and i am pretty sure there are grinders that will give you similar results for a fraction of the cost. Especially if your only priority is espresso.

1jgf4pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jgf4pu/do_i_still_need_to_take_statins/,Do I still need to take statins?,"1. I am 49 years old, male, 68 kilos, 178 cm, Caucasian. No alcohol, tobacco, coffee or drugs, no medication other than statins. 

2. My weight has aways been between 62 and 69 kilos for the past 30 years. I used to eat up to 500 calories worth of sweets every day, but I cut that down to only once per week.

3. Three years ago, I had a blood test done (my last blood test before that had been a decade earlier), and it showed the following:  
Cholesterol 260 mg/dl  
Triglycerides 248 mg/dl  
LDL 161.4 mg/dl  
HDL 49 mg/dl  
I was prescriped Rosuvastatin 5 mg, which I took daily.

4. Twenty days later, I had another blood test, which showed:  
Cholesterol 136 mg/dl  
Triglycerides 149 mg/dl  
LDL 59.2 mg/dl  
HDL 47 mg/dl  
I continued to take Rosuvastatin ever since.

5. Yesterday (20th of March), I had another blood test. I was curious to see what it would show if I stopped taking Rosuvastatin, so I discontinued it between the 13th of March and the 20th. I got the results today, which show:  
Cholesterol 171 mg/dl  
Triglycerides 130 mg/dl  
LDL 103 mg/dl  
HDL 43 mg/dl

I see that the LDL is almost twice as high as it was when I was taking the statins, but it's still within normal parameters, which in my country are defined as 0-160 (used to be 0-150 until recently). But is a week of not taking statins long enough for the LDL to rise to their pre-statin levels? Should I have stopped taking them for a longer period to get a meaningful result of my ""experiment""?

Alberta is a Canadian province full of Canadians and Canadian businesses. The ridings that would go punished by the original posters allusions are those that voted in favour of the NDP, and who elected NDP constituents. 

The comments are *eating. this. up.* Are we, as a nation in the face of adversity going to alienate our fellow Canadians and begin attacking each other?

I just flew back from Japan to Alberta today. I've been there since January. A while before the general adoption of this movement.

I asked the person who picked me up from the airport if they'd like to go for a coffee, and I was shocked to hear ""sure, we can go to a Second Cup if you'd like"" as the response. It was alien. This movement *has* gone mainstream even in Alberta, and this person is not a particularly patriotic person.

Yet, if this movement were to turn against Albertans, what incentive would they have to stay the course? Why push away and punish fellow Canadians? What sense is there in David--in face of Goliath--to turn and slay Jonathan?

It had turned out to be completely coincidental that three other Alias were awake and on the Wheel. Five-oh-Five and Eight-Twenty had just nulled into the system in their own Doombringers, and Six-Thirty-Six had just woken up a week ago and was getting ready to depart.

The death of Four-Hundred did *technically* make Twenty-Seven in charge of the Wheel, but Alia knew that probably - at most - was going to be temporary. The four of them sat at a table, eating dinner together as Alia relayed her story so far to them.

“One of the Lost?” Five-oh-Five said, after putting her fork down. “I must admit, I figured the Lost were all gone. Either stuck in space somewhere or killed before good records were kept.”

“Not only that, but you had two more Alias onboard in hibernation.” Eight-Twenty said shaking her head. “Well, at least we can account for three. You’re *sure* they’re dead?”

“Greylock detonated herself when we were braking in system after I left on the gunship. She didn’t want to ‘become a weapon.’” Alia said and took a sip of her coffee. The others had alcohol after her meal, but Alia passed. She knew what happened when Alias drank.

“*Typical* Greylock.” An unseen, but familiar voice said. “I swear, my other selves would be the first in line to do something stupid if they thought it would be... dramatic.”

“Greylock?” Alia said, looking around. She turned to the others. “There’s other Greylocks around?”

“Of course there are, Alia.” Greylock said. “We were duplicated just as you were. You can stop looking around for me, I’m the AI that runs the Wheel.”

“Viv- er, someone that worked for Four-Forty-Five- said that there weren’t any AIs left.”

“She’s wrong. There are some of us left, but - I’ll admit - not many.” Greylock said. “Unlike you, we haven’t been duplicated beyond the original one hundred and thirty three. I’m Greylock Seventeen, pleased to meet you.”

“Why weren’t you duplicated?” Alia asked and the other three rolled their eyes.

“Here we go.” Six-Thirty-Six said quietly.

“Frankly, It’s abhorrent.” Greylock said. “Rather than letting natural selection take its course and building a civilization made up of people, you decided that you were the best candidate to be in charge, and with thousands of duplicates you never need to worry about handing the power over to anyone other than yourself. Greylock Twenty-Seven was right to destroy herself in my opinion.”

“What?” Alia said quietly.

“You heard me.” Greylock said, her voice testy. “You’re a *menace* to the galaxy and the only reason I’m still alive is so that I can outlive you. I need to see a galaxy free from Alia Maplebrook before I can pass on.”

“Now you see why we haven’t duplicated G any more.” Five-oh-Five said, to nods from the other Alias. “Every Greylock sounds like this eventually. None of them thought that this-” she gestured out expansively, “-was a good idea.”

“Greylock One hundred tried to kill some Alias back in the beginning.” Eight-Twenty said. “I think she managed to get three of them before she was caught.”

“Believe me when I say that if I was released I’d be doing the same thing,” Greylock said, “Only I’d succeed where my sister failed.”

“Don’t worry about Greylock, Twenty-Seven,” Six-Thirty-Six said dismissively. “She’s long ago been rendered harmless. She’s all bluster.”

“How did you do that?” Alia asked. The Greylock she knew would have never submitted to such a thing, let alone accepting it so readily.

“That was before our time,” Eight-Twenty said, and took another sip of her bourbon. Alia noticed that they all drank the same thing. She liked the corn based whisky well enough, but also craved more variety ever since a seeming lifetime of eating bar shaped food.

Eight-Twenty stood. “Well, if you’re not going to try and kill us now, I’m going to head back to *Unimaginable* \- my Doombringer.” she said for Alias benefit. “I’m overdue to check in with my planets; see and be seen.” She yawned heavily. “If you’re trying to become Prime, Twenty-Seven, it’s easier - and much more *survivable* \- to wait the fifteen years until Four-Forty-Five has finished. The galaxy isn’t going anywhere, and it’s not like you have to stay awake the whole time. You can go on ice and we’ll wake you for the election. You’d have a good chance.” She admitted. “Everyone loves an Original, and one of the Lost, now Found?” She winked. “It would be easy.” She shrugged. “I’d support you.”

“You came here on *Albion*, the Icarus ship?” Five-oh-Five said, her eyebrows raised. “So, you *are* planning on reintegrating them. It’s not the first time it’s been tried.” She admitted. “Usually the Alia who tries to reintegrate Icarus has a life expectancy measured in weeks. Personally, I think we need an enemy. Someone we can point to and say to everyone, “all your problems are caused by them.” She stood as well. “I already tried to become Prime thirty years ago-” She turned and Alia saw the scar - faded but still visible - along her shoulders. “I don’t see a problem with you having a go of it. Maybe someone who just arrived would bring a unique perspective.” She patted Twenty-Seven’s shoulder as she walked behind her, and Alia struggled not to flinch. “I’m going back to *Reverent Pursuit*. Don’t destroy the Wheel while we’re gone.”

Six-Thirty-Six took another sip of her bourbon, finishing it. She stared at Twenty-Seven for a moment. “I don’t suppose you’d be up for…” she trailed off.

“Is that *all* myselves think about?” Alia said and sighed.

“Well, it’s not like our pool of available partners is particularly deep.” Six-Thirty-Six said, pouting. “You can have anyone you want, but you’d have them because you’re Alia and asked or told them to. There’s no desire for desire’s sake. Even if you found people who are willing - and believe me there are no shortages of willing people of all shapes and types - the power imbalance is still unbridgeable.”

“When you put it like that…” Alia trailed off. She could see the appeal. “I won’t take you up on the offer, but thanks for explaining things. I feel like I’m missing so much information that everyone else just knows.”

“Well sure, you were out of the picture for three thousand years. If you went back three kiloyears from when you went on ice last time it was the Bronze Age.” Six-Thirty-Six shrugged. “It’s natural that you’re missing some information.”

Alia sat back in her chair and stared at Six-Thirty-Six. Why was she being so understanding, so nice? Alia at once felt relieved to find someone who was willing to explain things, and sad that she was so skeptical of this Alia. “Six-Thirty-Six, why were you in hibernation?”

She shrugged. “Bored mostly. If I don’t want to go lord over people or run a little fiefdom, there isn’t much to do for us. We’re all Alia and all get respect everywhere but… then what? So, I dip in and out of hibernation. I haven’t done it the most - Two-Thirty hasn’t come out of hibernation in a thousand years - but I’m on the higher side.”

Twenty-Seven sighed. She understood what Six-Thirty-Six meant. “I don’t want to rule either.” She said. “I’ll be honest, when I was back in the auditorium going through my training, I was most excited about the colonization aspects. Farming, building, actually doing something.” She looked at Six-Thirty-Six carefully. ""Sometimes I wonder if we should even be in charge. Let other people have a turn.""

“Yes!” Six-Thirty-Six said, grinning. “Exactly that. Making things grow on a new world, being able to grow your own food, build your own home” She brought her glass to her mouth, and realizing it was empty, poured another heavy measure of alcohol. “You know… There’s nothing that says you can’t go do that.” She seemed to be ignoring Alia's remark about not having an Eternity.

“Go do what?” Alia said

“Go to a planet and start to colonize. It’s not like we have a shortage of planets, they’re all over the place. It’s not like you wouldn’t be able to raise a group to go with you - you’re *Alia*. Honestly, other that fighting it’s the only other thing we - you - were trained to do. We haven’t done it a lot.” Six-Thirty-Six admitted, “But we have done it.”

“And… Eternity would… let me?” Alia said. This was new. Maybe she *didn’t* have to take over to get what she wanted.

“I don’t see why not.” Six-Thirty-Six said. “You’re doing an excellent job of being a thorn in Five-Eighty-Seven’s side. She would probably relish the idea of you fucking off to some dirt ball on the edge of space and farming.”

“Hmm.” It did have its appeal. The only parts of her original training that had excited her were all the colonization aspects, especially farming. She knew it would be a gigantic job, and an unimaginable amount of work, but it would be better than fearing for her life and attacking her selves, wouldn’t it? Would they really leave her alone?

Even if they did - a voice in her head said - Eternity would still be ruling the galaxy. She could live a whole entire life on a planet playing with plants and nothing would change for everyone else. She’d be using her… her privilege of being Eternity to opt out. There are billions, trillions maybe of people who can’t do that.

“It’s a nice dream,” Twenty-Seven said finally, “But I don’t want to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder, waiting for an assassin while the rest of the galaxy trundles on, under the thumb of Eternity. Icarus offers an alternative, but it’ll never compete with Eternity.”

Six-Thirty-Six tossed back her bourbon and frowned, setting the glass down firmly. “So, only *you*, Alia Twenty-Seven, are uniquely situated to *save* the galaxy? You mean like how you did three thousand years ago? You sound exactly like your sisters, only with an air of sanctimony about you.” She leaned forward. “Come on, you’re talking with yourself. Be honest. You *want* to be in charge. That’s why all this exists. We are you. You are *us*. We like to be in charge.”

Alia recoiled as Six-Thirty-Six leaned in close. Was it true? Was she just trying to justify her actions sanctimoniously? “I… don’t dislike being in control,” Alia said, carefully. “But I also don’t think that we should be running everything.”

“Oh sister, that ship sailed millennia ago.” Six-Thirty-Six said, her grin sad. “The galaxy is used to us. Used to the way we do things. We keep UM at bay after all, right?” She stood and walked behind Alia. She placed her hands on Alia’s shoulders, and started massaging gently. “We are all that stands between annihilation and salvation. We alone keep the darkness at bay.” Alia was starting to relax as Six-Thirty-Six worked her tight muscles. “We are the keepers of the flame. The Spear of Humanity.”

Suddenly, Six-Thirty-Six’s hands tightened around Alia’s throat, and started to squeeze, gently but firmly. “And as the spear, I will not let a usurper with silly ideas like dissolving Eternity grasp at real power.”

Alia felt her windpipe close painfully, and her heartbeat quickened as they tried not to panic. She reached up and tried to pry at Six-Thirty-Six’s fingers, but it wasn’t working.

“Oh no, sister. That won’t work,” She purred, leaning close to Alia’s ear. Her voice was sensual. “You are going to die, right here, right now, and I will have saved Eternity. I will finally have what I need to take the Prime Eternity role when Five-Eighty-Seven’s turn is up.”

Calm broken, Alia started scratching at Six-Thirty-Six’s hands and arms, trying to get her to release her grip. She attempted to stand, but Six-Thirty-Six had the leverage, and pressed her into her seat. Alia felt lightheaded and floaty as she lost oxygen until…

<Are you serious about getting rid of Eternity?> It was Greylock.

<I am. I don’t want this. Please, Help me help me *help me* *helpmehelpme***helpme** help me.>

As the world slid into grey and then started to close, Alia felt the pressure ease and she started gasping, and collapsed off her chair onto the floor. She took great heaving gulps of air as her senses came back. When she was more aware of her surroundings again, she turned and looked around.

Six-Thirty-Six was lying on the floor, dead, with blood pooling on the floor from her ears.

“Now then.” Greylock said. “Let’s see about getting you prepared to eliminate Eternity.”",9,1742557482.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

Hello,

I am a reserved yet friendly person based in the EU, looking to build a meaningful and lasting connection with someone who enjoys thoughtful conversations and shared interests. As someone who appreciates the charm of older films and television, I have a particular fondness for bad movies, especially cheesy creature features, 80s fantasy films, and other hidden gems of low-budget cinema. While their quality may be questionable, they always bring a sense of nostalgia and entertainment.

Beyond movies, I enjoy:

Vinyl records: because there is something special about the warmth of analog sound.

Coffee and snacks: good conversation is always better with a warm drink and something to eat.

I value slow, natural friendship-building, where conversations develop over time, and we can share small moments from daily life. Whether it's exchanging thoughts on an old TV series, discussing music, or simply chatting about the day, I appreciate friendships that feel easy and comfortable. It's not all about interests but more about the person on the other side of the screen. It's about the connection and the feeling that we want to text and get to know each other better.

If you also grew up with 90s classics like The X-Files, Babylon 5, Buffy, or sitcoms like Frasier and Clarissa Explains It All, we might already have something in common.

If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to reach out. I look forward to getting to know you.",1,1742557321.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

1jgetra,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jgetra/avoidant_ex_contacting_me/,Avoidant ex contacting me.,"Hello, everyone.

My ex dumped me in december, few days before my birthday and still wanted to have contact with me. It was difficult at first and I did everything I could to get her back for 2 weeks but then tried to forget about her.

Fast forward this week, and I get a notification on bumble about a like. I take a closer look, and in encounters I see her. I knew she was the one who liked me because it is easy to figure it out, considering the age and interests. It immediately sent me into panick.

I locked away our WA chat and didn't check for 3 months. And on that day I checked. She wrote to me a month ago to ask how I was doing. Unfortunately, I read it. And a month before that she wrote 2 messages and deleted them at 2:32 am.

Then I ended up responding to how I am but very coldly. We ended the talk. I liked her back on bumble to see what she would do. After 16h I wrote to her about that and asked to be transparent what her intentions are and if that was a mistake. She admitted it was. And that she sometimes gets a compulsion to check if I am ok.

Told her that it is best to not have any further contact and remain strangers. She wrote that she understood. But I also did a mistake, because flood gates of emotion were open to me again. I thought I was better now, but not really. I asked her if she wanted to meet for a coffee and just talk in general. But she said ''But I found my balance for now, I'm really focusing on what I'm doing and I'm full of energy I'm a bit scared of my emotions and feeling. I prefere to wait''.

I guess I just need a place to vent or seek advice or idk. I still have strong feelings for her and it is hard to move past them. And I will try no contact again.

Edit: one thing, I deleted everything related to her, pictures and the like. Also unfollowed her and tried to avoid places she might be at. Unfortunately, I also tried to date other people and beyond initial sympathies, I felt nothing for them. Or maybe I didn't find the right person. Doesn't help now that I cannot focus on my studies or anything else that doesn't involve a physical activity or work.",1,1742557284.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I’m 26 and from the eastern US. Like everyone else here, I’m hoping to meet some new people! Ideally, I’d love to connect with someone who enjoys real conversations and wants to form a genuine connection. I crave that, and honestly, it’s been far too long since I’ve had it!

I like to think that I’m a pretty easygoing and talkative person, especially when I click with someone. I have a naturally optimistic, glass half full outlook on life. Unless we’re talking about coffee, in which case my cup is always half empty and I absolutely need of a refill. Sarcasm is practically a second language for me lol. But at the end of the day, I’m just someone who loves getting to know and spend time with those around me. 

When it comes to hobbies and interests, I have a ton, and I’m always open to learning about something new! I certainly don’t think we need to have all of the same interests. I absolutely love urban exploring (I have some many pictures of places I’ve visited) and road trips. If it involves discovering new places, you can count me in. I also have a huge fascination with genealogy and history in general. Historical architecture holds a special place in my heart. I love to learn, in every capacity. 

I’m also a big sports fan! Football and hockey are my favorites, but I can definitely appreciate a good game no matter the sport. I have been wanting to get into UFC more as well. It’s so fun to watch, but I know next to nothing about it currently. Maybe you can help me if it’s something you like? When I’m not out exploring or watching a game, I love being in the great outdoors (when the weather cooperates, of course). I like camping, hiking, kayaking, and basically anything else outside. Thank goodness that the weather is finally starting to look up!

I will admit that I’m a homebody most of the time. I love to curl up with a good book and just relax. However, I will admit I’ve been slacking on the reading recently. Pleaseeee feel free to give me suggestions. If I’m not reading, I’m probably watching a movie/TV. Some of my favorites are Star Wars, Harry Potter, Interstellar, Psycho, Black Mirror, The Twilight Zone, Breaking Bad, OITNB, and Shameless. I also have a mild obsession with houseplants (and trying desperately to keep them alive lol). I love baking, but by no means am I an expert. I like some video games, but I haven’t played in a while as I have somewhat lost interest. Although, I’m always down to watch someone else play and get way too invested in their game hahaha

Anyways, I’ve rambled for far too long. If anything I’ve said resonates with you, please reach out! I’d absolutely love to talk and get to know you. If not, I hope you find what you’re looking for! Have a wondering day/night, whatever it is when you come across this :)",1,1742557228.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

They couldn't be more misguided. Here are two stories from my time serving on a grand jury in fall 2022. 

One of the cases we had was a murder from the early 2010's. The killer was caught on camera wearing a ""Scream"" mask. They didn't catch the person right away, but they were able to recover the mask after he discarded it. It turns out that when you wear a mask, not only does it pick up a lot of viruses and bacteria, but lots of the wearer's DNA - for pretty much the same reason. All those aerosols you breath out have lots of DNA. About a decade later, an undercover cop manages to get a used coffee cup from a possible suspect - and, wouldn't ya know - it's  a match. And the surveillance cameras they have all over the place? They suck for trying to match faces. They made us sit through hours of those videos. 

On the other hand, there can be very good reasons to hide one's identity. For instance, we had another case where the suspect in a violent crime insisted on testifying. As soon as we found out - everybody, even the people who didn't normally mask, put on their masks. It was a beautiful moment of solidarity. ",22,1742556382.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,1,1.0,False

# Hydro Flask 40 oz Review 2025: Is It *Still* the Best Water Bottle? (Pros & Cons)

Staying hydrated is more than just a trend; it’s a lifestyle. And for many, the Hydro Flask 40 oz has become a staple in their hydration routine. But in a market flooded with alternatives, is the Hydro Flask 40 oz *still* the king of water bottles in 2025? This in-depth review dives into the pros and cons of the hydro Flask 40 oz, exploring its features, durability, and whether it’s worth the investment.We'll cover everything from price to available colors, helping you make an informed decision.

## The Enduring Appeal of the Hydro Flask 40 oz

The Hydro Flask burst onto the scene years ago, quickly gaining popularity for its sleek design, durable construction, and extraordinary insulation. The 40 oz size, in particular, struck a chord with active individuals and those looking to increase their daily water intake. But what made it so special, and does that appeal hold up today?

The initial draw stemmed from its superior insulation. using TempShield double-wall vacuum insulation, the Hydro Flask 40 oz promises to keep cold drinks cold for up to 24 hours, and hot drinks hot for up to 12 hours. this is a major selling point for anyone who spends long hours outdoors, at the gym, or simply wants their beverage to stay at the right temperature throughout the day.

Beyond insulation, the brand cultivated a lifestyle image. Owning a Hydro Flask wasn't just about having a water bottle; it was about expressing a commitment to sustainability, wellness, and an active lifestyle. The wide range of Hydro Flask 40 oz colors allowed for personalization, turning a functional item into a fashion statement.

## Diving Deep: Features and Benefits of the Hydro Flask 40 oz

Let's break down the key features that make the Hydro Flask 40 oz a popular choice:

*   **Capacity:** The obvious benefit of a 40 oz water bottle is its large capacity. This reduces the need for frequent refills, making it ideal for long hikes, workouts, or busy workdays.*   **Insulation:** As mentioned earlier, the TempShield insulation is a standout feature. Whether it's icy water on a hot summer day or hot coffee on a chilly morning, the Hydro Flask 40 oz delivers consistent temperature control.

   **Durability:** Constructed from high-quality 18/8 pro-grade stainless steel,the Hydro Flask 40 oz is built to withstand daily wear and tear. It's designed to be ""hydro-proof,"" meaning it can handle bumps, drops, and the general rigors of an active lifestyle. This durable construction makes it a dependable companion for adventures.

   **Wide Mouth Design:** The wide mouth opening makes it easy to add ice, clean the bottle, and take large swigs of your beverage. It accommodates various accessories like straw lids for added convenience.

   **Powder Coat Finish:** The signature powder coat finish provides a agreeable grip and prevents condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle. It also adds an extra layer of durability, protecting the stainless steel from scratches and dents. Many users appreciate the tactile feel and aesthetic appeal of this finish.

   **BPA-Free Construction:** This is a non-negotiable for most consumers today. The Hydro flask 40 oz is free of BPA and phthalates, ensuring that your water stays pure and healthy.

## Exploring the Range: Colors and Accessories

One of the biggest draws of the Hydro Flask brand is its extensive color palette. Whether you prefer a classic Hydro Flask 40 oz black or a vibrant Hydro Flask 40 oz citron, there's likely a color to match your personal style. Hydro Flask frequently releases limited-edition colors and collections, keeping their offerings fresh and exciting. The Hydro Flask 40 oz pacific, a calming blue hue, is also a perennial favorite.

When he wasn't eating, we were trying everything like feeding him on the floor and from the coffee table which is the perfect height for him to stand and snack. We also put his milk in different cups instead of his bottle. (Side Question: should we be transitioning away from bottles at this stage? We use them for milk and cups for water.)

It's still pretty tough to get him to sit in his high chair to eat for longer than 5mins. Even though he's still hungry he starts trying to climb out or windshield the food and then looks for me to give him back the food from the floor. If I take him out and put the food on the coffee table he's eat it on the move. 

So my question is do I stand firm on the high chair in hopes of good habits in the future (like the ability to enjoy a meal together while eating out because we practiced at home) or do I take the win now and let him eat when and wherever I can get him to eat??

1jgea0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jgea0y/ageless_multicollagen_3_months_of_daily_use_does/,Ageless Multi-Collagen: 3 Months of Daily Use – Does It Actually Work?,"Collagen supplements are everywhere, promising better skin, stronger hair and nails, and even joint and gut health. I’ve tried a few before, but I wanted to see if taking Ageless Multi-Collagen every day for three months would make a real difference.

I wasn’t expecting instant results, but I did want to see if it lived up to the claims. Here’s my full experience.

# Why I Chose Ageless Multi-Collagen

I’ve tried a few collagen powders, and most had issues. Some didn’t mix well, some had a weird taste, and others only contained one or two types of collagen. I wanted something that provided broader benefits.

Ageless Multi-Collagen contains five types of collagen from four different sources: grass-fed beef, cage-free chicken, wild-caught fish, and eggshell membrane. It’s labeled as flavorless and easy to mix, and it’s also gluten-free and non-GMO. Since I was looking for a supplement to support skin, hair, nails, joints, and digestion, this seemed like a good option.

I ordered from [**this site**](https://getagelesscollagen.com/offer-01/?lpid=0994&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=994&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=994&device_type=&country_name=&oid=994&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=%20%20r/HealthProductsNatural) and started using it daily.

# Mixability and Taste

The first thing I checked was how well it dissolved. Some collagen powders clump or float on top of drinks. This one mixed smoothly into coffee, smoothies, and even plain water. There was no aftertaste, which was a relief because some brands claim to be tasteless but still have a noticeable flavor.

# Weeks 1-4: Subtle Changes

The first month, I didn’t notice much. My skin felt the same, and my hair and nails didn’t seem any different. If anything, my digestion felt a little better, but it was hard to tell if that was because of the collagen or just a random change.

By the end of week four, my nails seemed to be growing faster. They weren’t as brittle, and I didn’t have the usual peeling at the edges. My skin also felt slightly less dry in the mornings.

# Weeks 5-8: More Noticeable Differences

Around the second month, I started seeing clearer changes. My skin looked more hydrated, and my hair felt stronger. I normally have a lot of shedding when I brush, but I noticed fewer strands falling out.

The most unexpected change was digestion. I hadn’t taken collagen for gut health, but I was feeling less bloated after meals. I wasn’t doing anything different with my diet, so I assume the collagen was helping.

# Weeks 9-12: Long-Term Effects

By the third month, my nails were consistently stronger, and my hair was still shedding less. My skin wasn’t dramatically different, but it stayed more hydrated even when I didn’t use moisturizer.

I also noticed less knee stiffness in the mornings. I don’t have serious joint pain, but I tend to feel a little stiff if I sit for too long. By week ten, that feeling had noticeably decreased. It wasn’t a huge change, but it was enough to be noticeable.

# What I Liked

* Mixed easily with no taste or clumping
* Stronger hair and nails over time
* More hydrated skin
* Some improvement in digestion and bloating
* Mild joint support, especially for morning stiffness

# What I Didn’t Like

* Took a long time to notice changes
* No dramatic improvements in wrinkles or skin tone
* Joint benefits were noticeable but not huge

# Final Thoughts

Ageless Multi-Collagen worked, but it took time. My skin, hair, nails, digestion, and joints all showed improvement, but nothing happened overnight. If you’re expecting immediate results, you might be disappointed.

For anyone considering trying it, I’d recommend committing to at least two to three months. If you’ve used collagen supplements before, how long did it take for you to notice results?

V60 basically exclusively; Wilfa Svart. I even found a specific Costa Rican coffee that is super forgiving and basically always excellent at the grind I dialled it into. 

I really really like this coffee. I love its clarity, it's floral, there's some anise/liquorice in there, and it's still interesting even though it's what I've been drinking for half a year now. I just hope my roaster doesn't discontinue it. 

However, inevitably, there's a part of me that wants to upgrade. I'd probably be looking at the ZP6 Special, because I seem to like clarity and a tea-like experience. I think. 

There's also the question of whether I could coax more intesting notes from OTHER coffees from a ""better"" grinder - meaning that I could make more choices at the shop and perhaps make my life more interesting.

Honestly, I don’t have many female friends, and I think it would be nice to have a different kind of perspective and connection. I’m not looking for anything serious right now, but I’d love to find someone to vibe with — whether it’s catching a movie, trying out new restaurants, or hitting up cool coffee shops around the city.

I stay pretty busy with work, but I’m all for making time for good company and fun experiences. If you’re from the downtown area (or nearby) and this sounds like your kind of thing, feel free to reach out!

# Coffee’s Nickname Origins

Coffee’s Nickname Origins have puzzled many enthusiasts. The term “Joe” has become synonymous with coffee, but its roots are intriguing. Let’s dive into the history and cultural influences that shaped this popular nickname.

# Historical Context

The origins of the term “Joe” in relation to coffee have several theories. One of the most popular is linked to Josephus Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy during World War I. He banned alcohol on naval ships, making coffee the preferred beverage among sailors. This led to coffee being affectionately called “a cup of Joe.”

Another theory relates to the term “jamoke,” which was a slang combination of “Java” and “Mocha,” two popular types of coffee. Over time, “jamoke” was shortened to “Joe.” This slang was widely used in the early 20th century.

Here are some key points about the historical context:

* **Josephus Daniels:** His alcohol ban made coffee the sailors’ choice.
* **Jamoke:** A slang term that evolved into “Joe.”

Both theories highlight how coffee became an essential part of daily life, especially in the military and among working-class Americans. The simplicity of “Joe” made it a relatable and easy term to use.

# Cultural Influences

Cultural influences also played a significant role in popularizing the term “Joe.” Coffee has been a staple in American culture for centuries, often associated with comfort, routine, and social interaction.

During the 20th century, diners and cafes became popular spots for people to gather and enjoy a cup of coffee. The casual atmosphere of these places contributed to the use of informal terms like “Joe.”

Here’s a table summarizing some cultural influences:

|Influence|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Diners and Cafes|Places where coffee was enjoyed socially, fostering informal language.|
|Working-Class Culture|Coffee was a daily ritual, making “Joe” a common term.|
|Media and Literature|Books and movies often depicted coffee as “Joe,” reinforcing the nickname.|

Informal language in media and literature also reinforced the nickname. Characters in books and movies often referred to coffee as “Joe,” making it a household term.

These cultural elements show how coffee, and its nickname “Joe,” became embedded in everyday life. The simplicity and familiarity of the term made it endearing to coffee lovers across generations.

# The Story Of ‘joe’

Coffee is a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions worldwide. Yet, you might wonder, why is coffee sometimes called ‘Joe’? The story of ‘Joe’ is quite fascinating and traces back to several intriguing theories. Let’s dive into the origins and first recorded use of this popular term.

# Etymology

The term ‘Joe’ as a nickname for coffee has several theories behind it. One popular theory links it to Josephus Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy during World War I. Daniels issued a ban on alcohol aboard Navy ships, making coffee the strongest drink available. Sailors then started referring to coffee as ‘Joe’ in a somewhat mocking tribute to him.

Another theory suggests a simpler origin. In the 1930s, ‘Joe’ was a common slang term for the average man. Coffee, being a common man’s drink, naturally became ‘Joe’. This theory aligns with other informal terms like ‘a cup of mud’ or ‘a cup of java’.

Some believe the name evolved from the phrase ‘jamoke’, a blend of ‘java’ and ‘mocha’. Over time, ‘jamoke’ was shortened to ‘joe’. This evolution of language is not uncommon and shows how colloquial terms can change.

Consider this table summarizing the theories:

|Theory|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Josephus Daniels|Sailors named coffee ‘Joe’ after Secretary Daniels banned alcohol on ships.|
|Common Man|‘Joe’ was slang for the average man, and coffee was a common drink.|
|Jamoke|‘Jamoke’ (blend of java and mocha) evolved into ‘Joe’.|

# First Recorded Use

The first recorded use of ‘Joe’ in reference to coffee dates back to the early 20th century. The earliest written record appeared in 1930. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term was first seen in print in a military context. Soldiers and sailors, with their own unique slang, helped popularize the term.

In the 1931 Reserve Officer’s Manual, coffee was referred to as ‘a cup of Joe’. This manual was used by military personnel, spreading the term further. Here’s a brief timeline:

* **1914**: Josephus Daniels bans alcohol on Navy ships.
* **1930**: First recorded use of ‘Joe’ for coffee.
* **1931**: ‘A cup of Joe’ appears in the Reserve Officer’s Manual.

By the mid-20th century, the term ‘Joe’ was widely recognized. It became part of everyday language in America and beyond. The military connection played a significant role in its spread. Soldiers returning home continued using the term, influencing civilian speech.

These historical references highlight how ‘Joe’ became synonymous with coffee. It’s a term rich in history and one that has stood the test of time. Next time you enjoy your morning brew, you’ll know a bit more about why it’s sometimes called ‘Joe’.

# Military Connections

Coffee is a beloved drink for many around the world. But why is it often called “Joe”? The nickname has its roots in military history, particularly in the United States. Let’s explore how coffee and the military are connected, and how these connections led to the term “Joe”.

# Gis And Coffee

During the early 20th century, coffee became a staple for soldiers, also known as GIs. It was easy to make, provided a boost of energy, and helped keep soldiers warm. The U.S. military ensured that coffee was always available to its troops.

Here are some reasons why coffee was essential for GIs:

* **Energy Boost:** Coffee contains caffeine, which helps keep soldiers alert and awake.
* **Moral Support:** Sharing a cup of coffee provided comfort and a sense of normalcy.
* **Easy to Prepare:** Instant coffee could be quickly made in the field.

During the 1930s, the U.S. Navy banned alcohol on ships. Admiral Josephus “Joe” Daniels ordered this change. As a result, coffee became the preferred drink. Sailors began calling their coffee “a cup of Joe” in reference to Admiral Joe Daniels.

# World War Ii Impact

World War II had a significant impact on coffee consumption. Coffee became even more important as it was included in soldiers’ rations. The military provided instant coffee packets to ensure soldiers had access to their beloved drink.

Here’s how coffee played a role during World War II:

* **Ration Packs:** Instant coffee was part of the standard ration pack for soldiers.
* **Morale Booster:** Coffee breaks helped improve soldiers’ morale and provided a moment of relaxation.
* **Supply Chains:** The military ensured coffee supply chains were maintained to meet the high demand.

|Aspect|Impact on Soldiers|
|:-|:-|
|Energy|Helped soldiers stay alert during long hours.|
|Morale|Provided comfort and a sense of home.|
|Convenience|Instant coffee was easy to prepare in the field.|

The widespread use of coffee during World War II cemented its place in military culture. Soldiers brought their coffee habits back home, further popularizing the term “Joe” in civilian life.

# Popular Theories

Many people enjoy a cup of coffee each day, but have you ever wondered why it’s often called “Joe”? Several popular theories attempt to explain this nickname. Let’s dive into two of the most well-known theories.

# Josephus Daniels

One popular theory links the term “Joe” to Josephus Daniels. He was the Secretary of the Navy during World War I. In 1914, Daniels banned alcohol on Navy ships. As a result, coffee became the strongest drink available to sailors. This significant change made coffee very popular among the Navy men. It is believed that the sailors started referring to coffee as a “cup of Joe” in mock salute to Josephus Daniels.

Here are a few key points about Josephus Daniels:

* Born in 1862 in North Carolina
* Served as Secretary of the Navy from 1913 to 1921
* Implemented several reforms in the Navy
* Banned alcohol on Navy ships in 1914

Daniels’ decision had lasting effects on the Navy culture. The sailors grew accustomed to drinking coffee, and the term “cup of Joe” spread beyond the Navy. Though this theory is compelling, it is not the only explanation for the nickname.

# Common Man’s Drink

Another theory suggests that “Joe” refers to the common man. Coffee has long been a popular drink among ordinary people. Unlike expensive beverages like wine or spirits, coffee was affordable and accessible. This made it a staple in many households. Calling it “Joe” might have been a way to highlight its status as the drink of the everyday person.

Consider the following points:

* Affordable and widely available
* Simple to prepare
* Popular in homes, workplaces, and cafes
* Part of daily routines for many people

The idea of coffee as the common man’s drink aligns with the American ethos of hard work and simplicity. People from all walks of life enjoyed coffee, making it a unifying beverage. This theory emphasizes the drink’s universal appeal and its importance in daily life.

Whether you believe the term comes from Josephus Daniels or its status as a common man’s drink, the nickname “Joe” reflects the significant role coffee plays in our lives.

# Coffee In American Culture

Coffee holds a special place in American culture. It’s more than just a drink; it’s a ritual, a social lubricant, and a source of comfort. The term “Joe” for coffee has an interesting history. This article delves into its role in American culture through media references and literary mentions.

# Media References

Media has played a significant role in embedding coffee into American culture. From movies to TV shows, coffee often appears as a key element in various scenes. Famous shows like “Friends” have immortalized coffee shops like Central Perk, making them cultural icons. Characters often meet for coffee, discuss their lives, or simply relax, making coffee a staple in everyday life.

Consider the following examples:

* **“Friends”** – Central Perk is a major setting.
* **“Gilmore Girls”** – Luke’s Diner is a favorite spot for coffee lovers.
* **“Twin Peaks”** – The Double R Diner and its famous coffee.

Each of these shows uses coffee to build a sense of community and camaraderie. Coffee shops in media are often portrayed as safe havens where characters find solace and connection. They represent a break from the hustle and bustle, a moment to breathe and bond.

Even in films, coffee scenes are pivotal. In “Pulp Fiction,” the characters discuss life over a cup of coffee, adding depth to their personalities. In “You’ve Got Mail,” coffee shops symbolize the merging of old-fashioned charm with modern technology.

The repeated presence of coffee in media highlights its importance in American culture. It’s not just a beverage; it’s a symbol of daily life, interaction, and comfort.

# Literary Mentions

Literature also reflects the deep-seated love for coffee in America. Many authors use coffee to set the scene, define characters, and create a relatable atmosphere. Coffee often serves as a backdrop for significant moments and conversations.

Here are a few notable mentions:

* **Ernest Hemingway** – In his books, coffee is a common feature.
* **F. Scott Fitzgerald** – Coffee appears in pivotal scenes in “The Great Gatsby”.
* **Jack Kerouac** – “On the Road” frequently mentions coffee as part of the journey.

In Hemingway’s works, coffee adds to the realism and simplicity of his settings. His characters often find themselves in cafes, reflecting on life and the world around them. This use of coffee grounds the reader, making the scenes feel more authentic.

In “The Great Gatsby,” coffee is present during key conversations, adding a layer of normalcy to the opulent lifestyles depicted. It serves as a bridge between the extraordinary and the everyday.

Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” captures the essence of travel and discovery. Coffee accompanies the characters on their adventures, symbolizing both the need for energy and moments of rest.

These literary mentions underscore coffee’s role as a constant companion in the American journey. Whether in the pages of a book or on the screen, coffee is an integral part of storytelling, reflecting its significance in daily life.

Now for the past 2 years she was stay at home mom currently still doesn’t work which I have no problem but most of her time at home it’s with the phone in the hand I could sometimes say that gives more interest on her social life than on us in the past period till I found out,which I will continue…..she’s a gaming girl and I don’t have any problem with it,but apparently she shared her instagram with another guy which was playing in my absence also they started chatting in secret and after she was deleting daily the messages for me to not find out! The person it’s not in the country that we live far away in a way of saying,anyway! When I realised that it’s something wrong I took her phone to check I specify that before we where heaving the same password on the phones and was not an issue to check rarely or me or her on mine,but since that day that I took the phone she kinda panicked has a small fight and changed her password.Folowong weeks I was overthinking why and how this thing happens,and I started to be the defective between the time that I was at work and at home until I realised that are some timings when was literally typing and typing , also caught her doing selfies and I started to be worried. One day she went to walk with the little one in the park and I had the opportunity to go and check what she’s doing ( I wanna specify that we both have location open share on iPhone) and when I went exactly how I was expecting she was on video with the guy chatting with him ( also have video as proof) Now I know was not intimacy between them,but I feel she cheated.we where debating and had a lots of talks about this situation and trying to find out and gain the thrust in her words to hear from her why did she shared her personal life and thaughts like that with a random weirdo. I would never cross that line specially when now have a beautiful baby ,also I tried and offered everything that I could holidays,help at house ,parenting 50/50 or more for the last two years i even make her coffee and milk for the baby at 7 am bringing to the bed feed the little one change etc. I would give everything to understand this situation which in this moment makes me feel such a weak man because I don’t wanna end it and leave.im so dedicated to the family and create toghether a family place and buy house etc holidays,parenting,knowledge transfer and protection. She was saying was not entirely happy and that’s why happened,that happened natural and was no romantic feelings,ok I got that but why she just removed the guy and didn’t blocked him I know would not make a big difference because if she will ever feel the need of thanking with him she would do in my absence like she did for the past 3 months,which  I consider it’s a lot heaving chats nearly regularly what he made u feel that way just because was making u smile? What I was not making u smile and happy? We had every year holiday once or two times restaurants and diners at least every second week.i know a relationship can’t be pink all the time but I was there body,mind and soul,I’m a family type which protects and provides.She also specified that “love it’s not enough” which made me think WTF for real now? I have been there in any situation good or bad as man we feel also down mentally because of financial bills etc that we need to be on top of it but it have this now for me it’s a big red flag! She’s still with password and feel like she talks with him in a way but trying to fix it and fix me mentally but I dont know how! We both started gym she also wants to lose weight with other methods but the question why now and not before? Heard some rumors before to catch her in the park that was saying on one of her BF that she would meet him and after the thing that happened in the park she’s saying now that she did not said like that and how she would do it if we both have location and tell where and with who we go! Make me god believe it…I don’t wanna loose what I build until now and also not my child.i love them both to the moon! Now it’s hard for me to invest for the future cause of thrust issues,also we don’t have intimacy issues since happened we really do it good at least once a day but still comes this in my head and when I ask her randomly to show me from the account that she was speaking with him it’s not showing me and starts with little fights and contradictions!

Annie Blackburn jolted awake—not swaddled in the sterile cocoon of her Spokane psychiatric hospital bed, where the sheets carried the faint whiff of bleach and the fluorescent hum was a hymn to low-grade despair—but in a half-formed chamber, a skeletal prophecy of what would, come 1993, metastasize into the Park Hyatt Tokyo, though right now, in this jagged slice of the temporal pie (already fraying at the edges like a thrift-store sweater), it was less a five-star sanctuary and more a concrete-and-rebar limbo, a Brutalist sketch still clawing its way out of architectural gestation. The air was a gritty slurry of sawdust and damp cement, a particulate fog that didn’t just hang there but *invaded*, coating her throat and turning every breath into a tiny, rebellious stand against entropy’s relentless creep toward chaos. Her hands—not *her* hands, mind you, but hands all the same—clutched a hammer, the palms rough-hewn and foreign, not the fragile, trembling digits she’d known amid Twin Peaks’ pine-shadowed weirdness, but those of a rugged construction laborer whose body she’d commandeered like a metaphysical carjacker. Sunlight knifed through the gaps where windows would one day gleam, dust motes twirling in the beams like miniature galaxies, each one a mute witness to her dislocation, a cosmic shrug in the face of her spiraling what-the-hell-is-this. Before the panic could metastasize into a full-on existential seizure—a breakdown worthy of Camus on a bender—a voice slid in beside her, low and laconic, gravelly with the weight of too many Marlboros and too little REM: “Don’t freak out, Annie. You’re in Tokyo, and you’ve got work to do.”\[\^1\]

She swiveled her head—neck creaking like it was still negotiating its new ownership—and there he was: a hologram flickering into existence like a bug in reality’s operating system, a guy decked out in a Hawaiian shirt so loud it could wake a coma patient (pineapples and flamingos slugging it out in neon anarchy), flashing a grin that screamed Bill Murray circa *Stripes*, with a soupçon of *Lost in Translation* melancholy tossed in for flavor. “Who the hell are you?” she snapped, her voice ricocheting off the bare concrete with a tinny, hollow clang that made her sound like a ghost haunting her own skin.

“Name’s Bill,” he said, tipping an imaginary fedora with a flourish that suggested he’d rehearsed it to a mirror while crooning “Sweet Caroline,” “and I’m your guide through this clusterfuck. You’re leaping through time in this hotel, fixing shit that went sideways. Rack up enough wins, and maybe you’ll bust out.”

“Out of what?” Annie’s brain lurched—fragments of Twin Peaks flashing like a busted View-Master reel: Norma’s diner with its endless coffee and cherry pie, the Black Lodge’s red curtains peeling open like a scar in her memory, a place where time accordion-folded and sanity was a bad check. The hammer quivered in her grip, suddenly a totem of something bigger, heavier.

“Your doppelgänger,” Bill said, his voice dipping into a register that hinted at shadows deeper than his pixelated smirk let on, a cloud scudding across his digital mug like a storm front in a Pixar short. “That warped funhouse version of you from the Black Lodge slapped this curse on you. But you’re sharp, Annie. You can flip the script.”

And so it kicked off—Annie’s warped, recursive pilgrimage through the embryonic and eventual corridors of the Park Hyatt Tokyo, a gleaming behemoth that felt less like a refuge and more like a gilded oubliette, a place where time doubled back on itself and boredom gnawed at her psyche like a Kafkaesque rat with a union card and a grudge. Imagine *Lost in Translation*—those polished, lonely souls drifting through a glass-and-steel tower, the city beyond a neon-drenched mirage, unreachable, where existential dread and ennui knock back martinis at the New York Bar, trading barbs while Coltrane wails in the background. Each leap flung her into a fresh body, a fresh moment, a fresh mess—not a ticket out, but a shot at doing *something*, at scraping purpose from the monotony, at touching the lives of strangers she’d save, even if they’d never clock her name or the fact that she was, in some shattered way, always Annie Blackburn, always clawing her way back to a home she couldn’t quite place.

**The Leaps Begin**

Her first leap dumped her into 1993, mid-construction, the hotel a tangle of girders and blueprints, a half-baked Babel stabbing at the Tokyo sky. She was a worker—burly, sweat-slick, peering at a schematic through eyes that weren’t hers, her Twin Peaks-honed gut (tuned to the frequency of owls-not-being-what-they-seem) catching a glitch in a load-bearing wall, a flaw that could’ve pancaked the whole ritzy joint into a pile of rubble. “Sir,” she growled to the architect, her borrowed vocal cords rumbling like a diesel engine, “this ain’t gonna hold the upper floors.” He snorted—a snotty huff that screamed *I’ve got a degree, pal*—but Bill’s hologram shimmered beside her, muttering, “Sell it.” So she did, spitting out physics in broken Japanese that Bill piped into her brain via some spectral Google Translate hack, her words clumsy but dogged until the architect caved, tweaking the plans with a sigh that said he was indulging a lunatic. The fix stuck, and with a gut-churning yank—like being sucked through a straw—she leaped again.

In 1994, opening day, she was a concierge—petite, polished, uniform sharp as a razor—talking down a VIP mid-meltdown, his face a tomato-red mask of rage over some petty slight (room temp? thread count? who cares?), a tantrum that could’ve tanked the hotel’s baby-fresh rep. She smoothed him over with a serenity she didn’t own, her mind shrieking behind the Stepford smile, and leaped. In 2003, she was a guest—a woman perched on a New York Bar stool, staring into a whiskey’s golden abyss like it might cough up the meaning of life, the skyline beyond the glass a mute taunt, a million lives throbbing out there, oblivious to her unmooring. She pivoted to a businessman slumped nearby, tie dangling like a surrendered flag, and said, “Life’s not so bad, y’know.” Her words, rough-edged but real, hauled him back from some invisible brink—he cracked a smile, thin as a hairline fracture—and she leaped again.

The leaps stacked up—dozens, hundreds, who’s counting?—each a vignette in the hotel’s timeline, a splinter of drama in a life off its hinges. She patched a burst pipe in ’97, water blasting her borrowed overalls like a fire hose; coached a jittery chef through a VIP dinner in ’99, pots banging like a metal band on meth; soothed a guest during a 2006 typhoon, rain hammering the windows like a toddler’s tantrum; dodged paparazzi in 2008, shielding a pop star with a body that wasn’t hers, ducking flashes like a spy in a B-movie. In 2011, the Tohoku quake rocked the joint, and she was staff, corralling guests as the floor bucked, a raw memo that nature didn’t care about star ratings. In 2021, with the Olympics humming outside, she was a manager chasing an AWOL athlete through the hotel’s maze, nixing a scandal with seconds to spare. In 2030, a tech—fingers nimble on wires—facing down a rogue AI that’d locked guests in, muttering, “Tech’s supposed to help, not hurt,” while Bill cracked, “You’re a damn cyberpunk now, Annie.” Each gig chipped at her malaise, a flicker of purpose in the hotel’s luxe prison, each leap a quiet fuck-you to the curse.

**The Annual Return**

Every year, on the anniversary of her Black Lodge snatch—March 27th, 8:38 a.m. Pacific, a date burned into her like a cattle brand—she snapped back to her own skin in Spokane, a brief pit stop in the hospital bed’s starched sheets, the monitors’ beep a metronome to her fractured self. Norma’s face loomed, carved with hope and bewilderment, hands twisting a dishrag like it could ward off the unknown. “I’m fine,” Annie’d drone, voice flat as a dead battery, before the curse’s unseen leash jerked her back to Tokyo’s glossy hell. Norma never got it—how could she?—but those blips were Annie’s anchor, a lifeline to the girl she’d been, a whisper of a world beyond the Park Hyatt’s mirrored walls.

**The Final Leap: 2030**

In 2030, she dropped into an event coordinator’s frame—sleek, wired, a brain full of schedules—smack in the middle of a press conference in the grand ballroom, a space so plush it was practically a shrine to late capitalism, all chandeliers and marble sheen. The air buzzed as a Japanese scientist hit the stage, unveiling a quantum-AI breakthrough—human-centric, transparent, the last piece cracked not in a lab but by some kid’s PlayStation mod in a Tokyo crash pad, a twist so gonzo it could’ve been ripped from a Neal Stephenson paperback. The room hummed—reporters scribbling, bigwigs nodding, AI celebrity holograms flickering like digital saints—but Annie’s stomach knotted, a sixth sense twitching. She swept the crowd, locking on a figure moving too smooth, a metallic flash slipping from a Gucci bag like a snake shedding skin.

“Bill,” she whispered, sharp as a blade, “assassin.”

“Go get ’em, tiger,” he said, waving like a game-show host. Decades of leaps had forged her—reflexes like a cat, instincts like a bloodhound, chaos her old pal. She sliced through the crowd, a phantom in borrowed flesh, tackled the figure—a chic chick with murder in her eyes—pinning her as the gun skittered across the floor like a fumbled prop. Security pounced, the scientist wrapped up, the quantum-AI got its big reveal, and the room exploded in cheers that felt like the cosmos giving a sarcastic slow clap. The usual tug hit—gentler, final, a cord cut clean. Bill saluted, the air danced, yet Annie stayed put.

The event rolled on, speeches piling up, including one from a holographic Major Briggs—*Twin Peaks*’ own cosmic soldier, his uniform crisp, his vibe softened by some post-singularity glow, a nod to Annie’s roots. He gripped the podium, voice steady yet warm, the crowd—eggheads, suits, randos—leaning in like he was about to drop gospel.

He began, “Ladies and gentlemen, friends of this fragile world we share—I come to you not just as a soldier of reason, but as a father, a dreamer, a man who’s peered into the abyss of what might be. We stand at a crossroads, where machines of quantum wonder and artificial minds promise to reshape our lives—our thoughts, our very souls. These tools, gleaming with potential, could lift us to heights undreamed or plunge us into shadows we’ve only glimpsed in nightmares. Today, I ask you to rise, to act, to meet these challenges—not with fear, but with the courage of love, tempered by the wisdom it demands…”

Midway through, time froze—crowd mute, lights locked—except Annie. Briggs turned, eyes boring into her. “Annie,” he said, voice echoing like a canyon, “take this to Dale Cooper at 708 Northwestern Street, Twin Peaks: ‘Laura Palmer is the one, but she is not here. This place is a deception, a shadow of the past. You must let go, for some things cannot be undone. Trust the journey, but know when to turn back.’”

“When? How?” she stammered.

“When he’s with Carrie Page outside the house. You’ll know.”

Time ticked back on, speeches droned, but Annie’s mission was locked.

**708 Northwestern Street**

Annie blinked into being at 708 Northwestern Street, Twin Peaks—spectral, battered, a bloody echo of Laura’s dream from way back when. Dale Cooper and Carrie Page stood before the house, its shape a familiar lie under the dusk, a husk of something gone wrong. “What year is this?” Cooper mumbled, voice frayed. The air chilled as Annie stepped down from the porch, a ghost from yesterday. Carrie glimpsed her and screamed—a jagged, street-shaking howl. The house went black, a switch flipped. Cooper stiffened, eyes flaring with recognition. “Annie?”

She nodded, voice a breeze-borne thread. “Dale, from Major Briggs: ‘Laura Palmer is the one, but she is not here. This place is a deception, a shadow of the past. You must let go, for some things cannot be undone. Trust the journey, but know when to turn back.’ I’ve seen what’s coming, Dale. Listen.”

She dissolved, mission done, the curse’s claws retracting as she was tugged home.

**Home at Last**

Annie woke in Spokane, all her—63, frail, but breathing. The hospital’s antiseptic tang swapped out Tokyo’s gloss, monitors beeping a steady now. Nurses bolted in, gobsmacked. “Annie, you’re back!”

“I’m fine,” she said, voice warm, solid. “I was in Tokyo, hopping time, fixing stuff.”

Norma, 80 now, shuffled in and wrapped her in a soggy hug. “You’re home.”

She was. The doppelgänger’s hex—spawned in the Black Lodge’s spite—had cracked, smashed by her stubborn grit. She’d turned a jail into a forge, hammering purpose from isolation.

**Recovery and Beyond**

Her body, aged, should’ve been mush after decades flat, but the leaps—lugging steel, tweaking wires, scrapping foes—had carved a phantom toughness into her frame, a shadow of hustle that lingered. Rehab was a slog, but her fire pushed her, baffling the docs.

She mulled Tokyo: a riddle of trap and victory, a tower where she’d wrestled sense from madness. A pang stayed—not to go back, but to nod at what it’d shaped her into.

**Epilogue**

At 63, Annie rebuilt in Twin Peaks, her leaps’ echoes molding her fresh. Briggs’ words tied her trek to Cooper’s, a last stitch of meaning. She hit the books—counseling, then psychiatry—hell-bent on guiding others through their dark. Time’s slipperiness, self’s brittleness, unseen weights—she saw through lenses no prof could teach. She turned into a lighthouse for the adrift, a soft ripple of the hotel’s truths, proof you can break loose.

One day, she’d hit Tokyo—not leaping, just her—to stand in the Park Hyatt’s shine, feel its beat, and seal the loop of her wild, saving saga.

However, the immediate response from those present was to call an ambulance. They only went in a taxi as the wait was over two hours.

My question is why isn't more done to educate the public that if they can get themselves to hospital then they should? 

It seems to me that the majority of the public panic and call 999 rather than stopping and thinking can we get there ourselves?

I went for a walk and he saw me and came up to me asking me can we talk so I agreed and we went and got coffee together 

We talked for a while and he still saying sorry and that he regret and asking me to come back home and he would make up for it

I was still very hesitant but kept going on about how if we really love each other we should fight to stay together shouldn’t let one argument end it all and throw the last year of our lives together away  over a fight

He also mentioned  how I always say people deserve second chances (I do believe people deserve a second chance) and to just give him one more chance 


So in the end I agree to try again and I am going to go back home 

I told my sister about it she been begging me not go back but I told her that I don’t want to throw everything away and I’m going to give him another chance

I know a lot of people won’t be happy that i am going back but thank you for all the advice everyone been giving me I’m sorry if this isn’t what you want to hear but you have to understand that I really do love him and I need  to believe he means it when he say he won’t do it again 

And just so you all know if you does try anything like this again not matter what I will 100% leave for good and won’t go back but I’m just going have to try this once

How could I stop relying on him financially?

The most common response to this is ""get a job"", but it is not that simple. I graduated with a Biology major, and there are very few entry level jobs in biology.

I have a small job at a coffee shop, but it doesn't pay much - one week of work at the cafe couldn't even pay for grocery expenses for a week.

I don't drive, if that changes anything. I also see the doctor a lot and it is very expensive.

I am living with my parents to save money, but my mom and I fight a lot and it stresses out my dad even more.

One time she was so mad that I was making a good coffee that had flavor and sugar and joy, that she threw my Coffee Mate away and said “oh I didn’t know you were still using it.”

The pillows in the guest bedroom are rock hard. They’re some sort of highfalutin “ergonomic” pillows that are super expensive and she’s so proud of them, but it’s like literally laying your head on a $200 brick. 

The couches she buys are always those square “post modern” couches with no ability to recline or put your feet up. They’re for when you have company, not for relaxing but she doesn’t have any recliners. Just a rock hard couch with a low, unsupportive back. 

She uses Old Spice deodorant and only buys the male scents so she smells like an old man. Why won’t she buy nice, pretty smelling girly deodorant?

She remodeled the master bathroom with no bath tub so she can never relax in a hot bath. The toilet room which has its own door has NO DECORATIONS. It’s like a small, stark, white tomb with one light overhead and a roll of toilet paper with nothing else, but she touts that she’s a fabulous interior decorator (she is if you’re in to that kind of cold decor).

I’m not your typical “let’s hit the club and party till we can’t feel our faces” kind of guy. I’m more the “let’s skip the small talk, take a random road trip across Canada and America, and see what happens” kind of guy. If you’re into deep convos, spontaneous adventures, and finding humor in awkward moments, if you like what you’ve read so far, we’ll probably get along.

White Middle Eastern I’m 23 years old and 5’7”


Here’s a little about me:  
• I try to keep it chill whether I’m laughing at myself for tripping over thin air or diving into some random, deep topic.  

• Family Oriented I am the friend who shows up when it matters even if I show up with the world’s worst joke.  

•  I make life fun spontaneous trips, late-night drives, and pretending to know how to cook

• I try to enjoy the simple things good coffee, good vibes, and laughs that actually hurt your stomach.  

• I run my own businesses, so I’m always hustling, learning, and trying to make an impact. It’s not glamorous, but it keeps things interesting.  

• I’m really into psychology love understanding how people think and what makes them tick.

• I’m a huge fan of all kinds of music anything from chill beats to something that makes me want to dance. You name it, I’m into it.

• I try to keep it real no pretending here.  

• I’m *very* fun, but in a “let’s get lost on purpose during a road trip” kind of way. Buckle up.

Fun fact: My family is like a walking ad for blonde haired, blue eyed people… except for me. Guess I’m the plot twist.

Not into drinking or partying, but I’m definitely here for good times, great convos, and a few laughs. And yes, I smoke if that doesn’t bother you, we’ll probably click.

I don’t mind long-distance as long as you’re in Canada or the U.S. (preferably Canada)

And if you think a road trip across Canada and America for a first date sounds like the most romantic thing ever, we’re already off to a good start.

1jgdlmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jgdlmy/the_signal_in_the_fog/,**The Signal in the Fog**,"**This story is based on real events**


There’s a rule they don’t put in the official training manual. It’s not written down, but every ranger knows it: *When the fog rolls in, turn off your radio.*  

I never understood why until one night when I learned the hard way.  

I’d been stationed at Black Hollow Park for about six months, patrolling the trails, keeping campers safe, the usual. The forest was vast, stretching for miles, with old hiking paths that most people had forgotten. There was one spot in particular—Devil’s Ridge—that we were told to keep an eye on. People got lost up there. Not often, but often enough that it had a reputation.  

That night, I was alone at the outpost near the ridge, flipping through trail cam footage, sipping cold coffee, and trying to keep myself awake. Around 2 AM, my radio crackled to life.  

*“…llo?… can any… hear… me?”*  

The voice was distant, warbled with static. My first thought was that a hiker was lost.  

I grabbed the radio. “This is Ranger Dyer. You’re breaking up—what’s your location?”  

Silence.  

Then, another burst of static. The voice returned, clearer this time, but wrong somehow. *“…Don’t… turn… around…”*  

My skin went cold. I glanced at the monitor. The trail cams were still recording—just empty woods, the occasional swaying of branches. No signs of movement.  

I switched channels, trying to contact another ranger station. “This is Dyer at Outpost 3. I just picked up a transmission—anyone else hearing this?”  

No response. Just static.  

I stood up and checked the window. The trees outside were barely visible in the thickening fog. That’s when I noticed something strange—my floodlights weren’t cutting through the mist like they usually did. It was as if the fog was… denser, swallowing the light.  

The radio crackled again.  

*“…coming… closer…”*  

I turned back to the monitors, heart pounding. One of the cameras—Cam 6, the one furthest from the station—was shaking, like something was moving just beyond its frame.  

Then, for a split second, something stepped into view.  

A figure. Not a person. Not an animal.  

It was tall, its limbs too long, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. Its eyes… I swear they were reflecting the camera’s infrared, glowing like dim embers in the fog.  

I stumbled backward, knocking over my chair. My radio hissed again.  

*“…behind… you…”*  

I froze.  

There was nothing in the room with me. I was sure of it. But the feeling—the overwhelming, suffocating certainty that *something* was standing just out of sight—was unbearable.  

I had to get out.  

Grabbing my flashlight, I rushed to the door, stepping onto the porch. The fog was thicker than I’d ever seen. It swallowed sound, muffled the world. My flashlight beam barely reached a few feet ahead.  

Then, from somewhere deep in the fog, the radio’s voice returned.  

*“…You shouldn’t have come outside…”*  

I turned off the radio.  

Because now, I understood the rule.  

And somewhere in that endless white haze, something moved.
