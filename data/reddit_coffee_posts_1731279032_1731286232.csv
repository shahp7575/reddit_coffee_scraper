I've tasted the filtered water I am using and there's nothing unusual about it.

Has anyone experienced this before? It is an interesting flavor that I am enjoying to be honest and was wondering if this something that is found in some coffee beans. Thanks!",1,1731286159.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúI like you as more than a friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had feelings for you for a long time.‚Äù

To make things worse, guys will follow up these type of ‚Äúconfessions‚Äù with the question of whether she feels the same. 
The answer is almost always a ‚Äòno‚Äô, in some shape or form. 
That‚Äôs because these type of confessions make women feel cornered‚Äîas if someone is suddenly putting a spotlight on them, and is expecting a certain response. Ninety-nine percent of the time they already know if a guy has feelings for them. It doesn‚Äôt need to be said.
If you are actually interested in dating her, rather than using her as an emotional sounding board, you have to frame yourself as a potential romantic partner, not creepy friend who vomits his feelings without warning.
- Simply begin to incrementally flirt with her more often. You can‚Äôt go from 0-10, it has to be subtle. Also, don‚Äôt flirt for the sake of getting a reaction; see if you both have chemistry. Have fun. You might find she isn‚Äôt a good fit for YOU beyond friendship. 
- 0-2: make a casual comment about her appearance that you genuinely feel. ‚ÄúYou look great when you wear your hair that way‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou look really cute in that color.‚Äù Express it in a way that you didn‚Äôt really notice it until now, and that you‚Äôre making more of an observation rather than an overt compliment.
- 2-4: The next time you see her, jokingly tease her (not neg), the same way a boyfriend would joke around with his girlfriend. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôd work as a couple, you‚Äôre ridiculous sometimes‚Äù. Whatever works in your dynamic; don‚Äôt make it as a cutdown to lower her self confidence. You both should be in on the joke. The teasing should be playful, not malicious.
- 4:6: Use subtle, innocent touch when interacting with her. Don‚Äôt overdo it. Touch her knee or arm when emphasizing a point in the conversation or making a joke. If you‚Äôre walking through a public place, gently touch her back as you navigate through people.
If she seems responsive to the escalations, then just simply ask her out, not to get coffee as friend, but on an actual date. 
If she says she doesn‚Äôt see you as more than a friend, you have your answer. If you don‚Äôt want just friendship, then tell her so in an upfront, but respectful manner. Until the feelings fade, keep your distance and keep meeting other women. Your ability to handle rejection like it doesn‚Äôt phase you will make you more attractive.

1gofq3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoImmuneProtocol/comments/1gofq3a/food_reintroductions_can_some_foods_be_combined/,Food Reintroductions - can some foods be combined?,"Hi there! 

Just finished my elimination phase of the Core AIP and starting to reintroduce foods. Was just curious (and I can't find any resources on this ANYWHERE) - can some similar foods be assumed to be tolerated if you have reintroduced another from the food group?

For example in stage 1 of reintroductions, legumes section, you can reintroduce green beans, runner beans, peas, snow peas, and sugar snap peas. Now peas, snow peas, and sugar snap peas - to me at least - are very similar. Can I assume if I pass the test for one, I can reintroduce all? Spending over a month reintroducing all of them seems a bit stark!   
  
I potentially assumed maybe the groupings in each stage could be reintroduced all together, but stage one has both chocolate and coffee in the same section (Nuts and seeds) and I assume they aren't similar enough to assume if you can have one you can have another.  

But yeah I feel like a few nightshades, legumes, nuts/seeds, maybe dairy could be introduced together? I just introduced egg yolk first (I used a chicken egg) and it has listed Chicken, duck, goose, quail etc - I want to be able to assume I can eat all now? But just need confirmation. 

I may be missing something on this - but if anyone has any advice please let me know or point me in the right direction! Don't want to seem like I am trying to take shortcuts etc. but understandably with such an extensive protocol, if there is anything that can be done to streamline the process, i'll take it!

I'm following the CORE guide on this page as well for reference - [https://autoimmunewellness.com/how-to-reintroduce-food-on-aip-the-definitive-guide/](https://autoimmunewellness.com/how-to-reintroduce-food-on-aip-the-definitive-guide/)",1,1731285857.0,AutoImmuneProtocol,0,1.0,False
1gofq2t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gofq2t,Update: South Africa Gin Haul - Taste Test! ,"I sampled all my gins from my South Africa trip! I did not sample the Hendrick‚Äôs Amazonia this round but I tried it last night and remember it to have a nice floral nose but a sharper biting finish. Included pictures of the label in hopes that it adds to your digital tasting experience! I tried everything neat and had my trusty coffee beans nearby to huff in between gins. Enjoy my amateur tasting review!! 

#1. Inverroche Amber 
Nose: Chocolate covered dried orange slices, spices, sultry. 
Palate: Notes of caramel, sits nicely on the tongue, luxurious mouthfeel (didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever use this word seriously!) 

Gorgeous gin that reminds me of a rich decadent dessert, like a warm caramel cr√®me brule sort. Absolutely delicious served neat. 

#2. Cape saint blaize
Nose: Like smelling a lemon twist while standing on the coast, salty ocean spray, earthy (from the rooibos). 
Palate: Citrusy, herbal, the brightness of sea salt, crisp. 

Earth, citrus, and sea breeze come together but somehow don‚Äôt taste muddled. The flavors take turns beautifully in one of the most unique gin profiles I‚Äôve experienced (which to be fair is not much lol) 

#3. Amarula
Nose: Mellow amarula, citrus, light juniper
Palate: Classic gin with gentle notes of amarula and citrus, nice juniper, sharper on the tongue at the end but not overpowering 

Produced by Heineken so it tastes like a good corporate gin with quality citrus and a nice nuttiness from the amarula fruit. 

#4. Cape Town Gin Rooibos
Nose: Steeped rooibos, herbal, orangey. 
Palate: Spiced tea, warmth, sits well on the tongue, rooibos flavor lingers around after sipping

This tastes like a nice warm cup of spiced tea. Could be made into a gin-based hot toddy! 

#5. Blind tiger blue
Nose: Deliciously sweet, dragonfruit, floral and fruity. 
Palate: Blueberry and dragonfruit, crisp, light, the wine cooler of gins (major complement in my eyes). 

An incredible gin that has bold dragonfruit and blueberry flavor paired with subtle elderflower. A real pretty light blue color too! Goes down a little too well, would be amazing in a cocktail or chilled neat on a hot summer evening. ",1,1731285856.0,Gin,0,1.0,False
1gofprq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/1gofprq/i_have_recently_learned_that_burger_bach/,"I have recently learned that Burger Bach, Charlottesville is now closed permanently.  As a former teenage employee, here‚Äôs my story.","I am a now almost 17 year old girl that worked at Burger Bach (said like Batch, not bock) for 6 months.  Between august of 2023 and april of 2024, I was shown the worst first job experience I could have been subjected to.  All names will be replaced with what nicknames they got called at work.  

When I started working, the manager that hired me, De, got me to put my email, phone number, and social security number on a bit of printer paper with no form or anything on it.  I was 15 at the time and had no idea how getting a job worked, knowing what I know now, I will never put my social security number on some random paper again.  The same manager had me working illegal hours even though he had my date of birth that, it being my first job, I did not know were illegal.  My first day of working, it was the day my sophomore year of highschool started and I was working until 11pm closing.  I had to be up for school at 7 the next morning. That same manager got fired for shit talking the store manager after butt dialing her and leaving her a 5 minute voicemail of a conversation he had with someone, shit talking boss lady with a friend.

During my time there, the kitchen guys, sunshine and coffee, would smoke weed on their breaks and then come back to the building high and smelling like weed, the manager(different one from before), B, knew and did not do anything.  Servers were vaping and smoking in the kitchen while on the clock and it was 100% not sanitary.  While I was there, probably 15 people were hired, and by the time i was gone, 14 of those people had quit because they hated it.  There were countless people fired for drinking on the job, fighting someone, or yelling at people.  We had hires that were constantly horribly racist and homophobic to the people at their tables while talking to other servers, making fun of them for not having money, being a certain race, or looking a certain way.  I was made one of the people when I told them to cut it off and they immediately started making fun of scars I have.  I was made to carry alcohol because ‚ÄúThe customers don‚Äôt know how old you are‚Äù.  The customers might not have known how old I was but the 30-50 year old men in the kitchen trying to get me to sleep with them sure as fuck knew how old I was.

My time there came to an end when the big boss lady, M, pulled me to the side and told me that I cannot keep leaving at 9:00.  I told them when they hired me that i was not to work past 9pm because I was 15-16 and had things to do at home, they hired me aware of that fact.  It is also illegal to schedule past a certain time in Virginia.  M told me that I would either have to open my availability more so she can put more hours on my schedule or she would have to stop scheduling me.  Right there on the spot I reminded her that she hired me knowing that I could not work past 9 and she said ‚ÄúI am aware of that but we were hoping you‚Äôd give up on that within the first month or so, it‚Äôs been 6 months and you aren‚Äôt budging, so we are forcing you to make a move‚Äù and I told her to take me off the schedule.  When I quit, I was the server that had worked there the longest at that point. I worked there 6 months.  The same month I quit, someone who had worked there 5 ish years had quit and moved to a different company.  Three days before I quit my work friend C quit.  

I was 15 when I started this job and I was made carry alcohol, work with people who wanted to sleep with me knowing I was underage, was made uncomfortable by customers hitting on me, was made write my social down on blank printer paper with a pencil, and was hired before the interview ended and before De asked my name or age, which, until now, I did not know was a massive red flag.

I‚Äôve only ever had one official boyfriend when I was in my mid-late teens and I dumped him because I caught him cheating on me.

I stayed single until three years ago when I started talking to a guy I had know for a while but never really saw that way until then. We talked for a couple months when all of the sudden he dropped me for a different girl. When I asked him what the hell was going on he said, and I quote, ‚ÄúI never actually liked you. I just wanted to see if I could get you to like me.‚Äù 

So I stayed single until about a year ago when I started talking to one of my mom‚Äôs friend‚Äôs sons. Things were going well for a while. At least I thought they were until he ghosted me. 

At this point, I‚Äôm done. I can‚Äôt figure out why guys think I‚Äôm such an easy target for an ego boost. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the fact that I was raised with literally no male influence (single mom and no extended family whatsoever), the fact that I‚Äôm a bit of a hopeless romantic, or if I‚Äôm just naive and gullible to believe that maybe someone might actually want me.

I‚Äôm the last single one in my friend group and I‚Äôm forced to watch them all with their husbands/boyfriends/fianc√©s when I can‚Äôt even get someone to at least go out for coffee with me. My friends say it‚Äôll happen when I least expect it but they don‚Äôt realize that that actually hurts more than it helps.

I‚Äôm not the prettiest or skinniest girl in the world. Far from it in fact, but I‚Äôm funny and caring and in my opinion have a good personality. 

I don‚Äôt have unattainable standards at all. I just want a guy that‚Äôs intelligent, treats me right, and loves my pets. And preferably wears glasses because I find them insanely attractive for some odd reason. 

My friends have tried to set me up with guys before but it‚Äôs never worked out because they all say ‚ÄúOh her? No thanks. I‚Äôm good.‚Äù when they realize it‚Äôs me that was being referred to. 

All I‚Äôve ever dreamed of is having the family I never had, and the older I get the more I realize that it‚Äôll never happen for me because I‚Äôm not pretty enough for the dating scene today.

It stayed casual until around mid-September, but we never made it exclusive. He said he wanted to stay single to focus on his career and date around, so I thought we were just FWB, but neither of us were seeing other people. Since I solely thought we were just FWB, I had a wall up to prevent myself from getting hurt. I didn‚Äôt allow myself to be truly vulnerable with him. We still went on dates, had sleepovers, and occasionally said ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

In late October, I told him I‚Äôd want more commitment soon, and that‚Äôs when he realized he didn‚Äôt feel the spark, so we broke up for good. The breakup felt sudden, and it made me realize we probably weren‚Äôt on the same page for months.

Now, most folks in those parts considered the Snallygaster a load of hogwash, a bedtime story to scare kids. But Benedict knew better. He'd seen the pamphlets, the blurry photos, heard the whispered tales from his eccentric Aunt Mildred, who swore she'd lost her prize-winning rooster to the beast.

So, armed with a butterfly net, a thermos of lukewarm coffee, and a healthy dose of skepticism, Benedict set out to find the Snallygaster. He trekked through the misty mountains, his trusty beagle, Watson, sniffing at every rock and root. Days turned into weeks, and the only creatures Benedict encountered were grumpy squirrels and overly-friendly deer.

One crisp autumn evening, as the sun dipped behind the mountain peaks, casting long shadows across the valley, Benedict stumbled upon a clearing. And there it was ‚Äì the Snallygaster! It was even more bizarre than the pamphlets described: a bird-like creature with metallic scales, glowing red eyes, and tentacles sprouting from its‚Ä¶ well, let's just say it was an unusual sight.

But instead of the terrifying screech Benedict expected, the Snallygaster let out a pathetic whimper. Upon closer inspection, Benedict discovered the creature was tangled in a barbed wire fence, its tentacles flailing helplessly.

""Well, now,"" Benedict muttered, ""aren't you a sorry sight.""

He cautiously approached the creature, Watson barking encouragement from a safe distance. With a bit of coaxing and some surprisingly nimble maneuvering (for a man who usually tripped over his own shoelaces), Benedict managed to free the Snallygaster.

Instead of attacking, the creature nuzzled against Benedict's leg, letting out a grateful chirp. It then proceeded to do something completely unexpected: it regurgitated a small, tarnished silver locket.

Benedict, bewildered, picked up the locket. It was engraved with the initials ""A.M."" ‚Äì Aunt Mildred!

""You ate my aunt's locket?"" Benedict exclaimed. The Snallygaster chirped sheepishly, its red eyes wide with innocence.

Suddenly, it all made sense. Aunt Mildred hadn't been exaggerating after all. The Snallygaster wasn't a fearsome predator; it was just a misunderstood creature with a penchant for shiny objects.

Benedict, with a newfound appreciation for the Snallygaster, decided to keep its existence a secret. He returned to town, locket in hand, and told Aunt Mildred he'd found it snagged on a branch. He left out the part about the bird-like, tentacled creature with indigestion.

From that day on, Benedict continued his research, but his approach changed. He no longer sought to capture or expose the Snallygaster. Instead, he became its protector, ensuring its safety and occasionally leaving out a few shiny trinkets to satisfy its peculiar appetite. And sometimes, when the moon was full and the wind whispered through the mountains, he'd swear he could hear the faint chirp of the Snallygaster, a reminder of the day he befriended the most misunderstood creature in Western Maryland.",1,1731285105.0,AIpapi,0,1.0,False

A few months ago I had the rug pulled out from under me when my wife left me unexpectedly after more than a decade together. We had so many good years, but had become very different people and drifted apart. I also recently lost my job, and while I've picked up plenty of contracting work, this is done from home so adds to the isolation. I don't have family close.  
  
Now well into my 30s, I‚Äôm finding it challenging to navigate life without our shared social circle.

Most of our friends were mutual (couples), and while I have supportive mates, they‚Äôre busy with their own family commitments. To combat the loneliness and depression, I‚Äôve started joining sports clubs and getting into running. I'm also seeing a counsellor, and attending church. But it still feels like I‚Äôm just trying to stay afloat while the world keeps spinning.

I‚Äôm reaching out to see if anyone here has experienced something similar and could offer some guidance or encouragement. Just to clarify, I‚Äôm not looking for a romantic relationship.

I‚Äôve been thinking about starting a science fiction book club, and wanted to see if anyone else is interested in joining! I‚Äôm a big fan of the Dune series, Hyperion, and pretty much anything by Ursula K. Le Guin, but I‚Äôm open to exploring new books and authors too.

Whether you‚Äôre a long-time sci-fi lover or just getting into the genre, it would be great to meet up (virtually or in person) and nerd out over all things speculative. We could pick a book each month and discuss over coffee, beers, or however we decide.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, drop a comment or send me a message. Let‚Äôs build a little sci-fi community here in Pittsburgh!",4,1731284520.0,PittsburghSocialClub,0,1.0,False
1gof99e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gof99e/i_pushed_my_ex_boyfriend_away_from_my_face_and_he/,I pushed my ex boyfriend away from my face and he flung me out of his house ,"Okay, so I met a guy around November 2023 and he was everything that I could‚Äôve ever imagined- super charming and definitely blew me away in terms of how you treated me. For context we attended the same university a few years ago but we never really met formally but I did remember his face. Until last year in November when he started following me on Instagram and everything just started very quickly we would speak on the phone for hours on end and so our romance commenced. For context- he had just come out of a 9 year relationship in June of last year.

The first time we met he came over to my house and I was actually super drunk because it was the end of year event at my company so he ended up coming over to my place quite late. It was probably the best night of my whole life we never ended up sleeping together but he did kiss me and didn‚Äôt try to be forward or give me any kind of sexual advances. He was super sweet too as he made sure that he brought me something as a gift since it was the first time coming to my house or even meeting me for that matter so it was just a really kind gesture which I felt was super sweet. He couldn‚Äôt seem to get enough of me and two days later, I ended up meeting with my parents for lunch and in a twisted turn of events he ended up joining us- that‚Äôs right he met my parents two days after we met for the first time. my parents seem to have loved them. I was really really in love with this man and he seems to be really really in love with me too. fast forward to a few weeks later I was going to leave to India for three weeks and it bothered me with regards to how the relationship would sustain itself considering the fact that we would not see each other for a good three weeks. thankfully I did not need to stress too much about that because whilst on holiday I managed to get a Sim card which enabled me to speak to this man when I had the chance to- and even when I didn‚Äôt have the chance to, I made a plan to speak to him but I could I did end up sleeping with him before I left to my trip and I think that I shouldn‚Äôt have because I was not actually his girlfriend he never asked me to be his girlfriend throughout the period of our relationship so I think that was an error on my side that I had been okay with agreeing to sleep with him even though I was the one who suggested it and of course he consented it‚Äôs just he never made me his girlfriend. fast forward to 3 weeks later, he fetched me from the airport I‚Äôm so happy to see him and he is so happy to see me. 

of course we had our fair share of disagreements before the trip, during the trip and now after the trip but I just boiled it down to being an intense amount of passion that existed between the both of us- like I said we were really in love with each other. He explained that he wanted to take things slowly and I agreed but his behaviour- like telling me that I‚Äôm his life, his heartbeat, etc, did not really indicate to me that he wanted to take things slowly. I was really confused by this and every time I pulled away because he would remind me of this, he would always retreat and say ‚ÄúI just want things to be back to normal‚Äù. 

He had a really big group of friends who actually worked with him and he was quite close to them I however only have one really good friend- a friend that I actually consider my best friend. she‚Äôs basically like my sister and I explained to him just how much she means to me considering the fact that we have been best friends for the past 10 years. he had introduced his friends to me but no interest in meeting my best friend. Sometime in February of 2024 he had asked that I join him for a dinner with his best friend and his best friend‚Äôs girlfriend both of whom he works with at his company.  I agreed and just for some context the best friend‚Äôs girlfriend seemed to have been a little bit too close with my ex if you wanna call it that. we had previously had arguments about her due to the fact that she just seemed to be too close to him and would never really allow me to fulfil my ‚Äúgirlfriend duties‚Äù and always jump to his aid, serving him food, attending to his needs, finding out he‚Äôs okay and this kind of made me uncomfortable. however to appease my ex I agreed to go out to dinner. fair enough enough we had a wonderful time it was probably the first time I had gone out on a double date in a very long time and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I had decided you know it was time to leave however my ex decided that it would be a good idea if we had gone to another bar which is not too far away from where we were at for dinner we had gone to the bar and it was brought up in conversation between my ex and I about the area that we were previously at and me just saying that the area is you know quite safe because I had previously parked my car there he had began to question me with regards to how is it that I know that that particular parking lot is safe. I had mentioned to him that I‚Äôd previously parked my car there and after all I am from the very area in question. he began to dig deeper and deeper as if I was kind of hiding something from him which I was not. I then had to explain to him that a few years ago I had parked at that same parking lot and I was meeting a friend and that friend walked me to my car and tried to come onto me -it was an extremely traumatic experience that I did not feel comfortable with trying to explain to this man in earshot of his friends. coupled with drinking we came home and we had a really large argument we were shouting and screaming and I‚Äôm not particularly proud of the exchange of words however he decided that he wanted to leave this was around 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning I refused that he leaves and I said that it‚Äôs too late to leave- if he did not feel comfortable with sleeping in my bed he is welcome to sleep on my couch. the next morning he told me that he didn‚Äôt feel like he wanted to be a part of the relationship anymore and he just needed some time to think he had a shower and he left my house and did not speak to me wait for it for a whole week he ignored my call ignored my text he ignored everything it was it was as if I was invisible to him he told me that he wanted to work things out and that he was coming to my house the next day to try and solve this we spoke for hours hours and hours and hours I was extremely upset not only did he goes to me for the past week but it wasn‚Äôt that large of an argument I deserve to be ignored for whole week it was very unlike him and that to me constituted punishment and torture then forgive him and we continued to date until two weeks later this is now around mid February February we had made up and things were great things were so great we shortly after Valentine‚Äôs Day and my birthday is at the start of March I had previously booked a ticket to a super nice location in our country and it was basically whilst I was still single during Black Friday in November 20 23 remember I met him in November 20 23 towards the end of the month it was I placed the order for the ticket days before I had just met him. He had accuse me of booking the tickets with the intention of me meeting my boyfriend in this other location I was flabbergasted as I previously explained to him that I wanted him to join me on this trip for my birthday at this location bear in mind I was willing to cover the cost of his plane ticket and the accommodation and of course visits budget friendly restaurants so that it wouldn‚Äôt take a financial toll on him he began to be outraged by this and every single time I asked bear in mind I had asked at least six times with regards to what it was that was gonna be the following up with regards to whether or not he Able to obtain leave from work for the trip because as you previously indicated that I should leave things up to him because he‚Äôs got things sorted out that had given me the indication that he was keen for the trip we went out and we had an argument about something so silly we were in the car and the man just decided to beat on the steering wheel scream loudly and shout at the top of his lungs I proceeded to get out of his car and try and get away from him as far as I could until he decided to tell me that he was actually going to harm himself I began to get really scared About this and followed him in the rain in the dark at night eventually we spoke and that was the end of the fight he went home and I went my own way too I decided that that was going to be the end of our relationship and I really just could not take it anymore if you few days later he reaches out and he says to me that he‚Äôs sorry and he didn‚Äôt mean to raise his voice like that he didn‚Äôt mean to hit his steering wheel and the only thing that I could think of the time was what if he gets so angry one day that that steering wheel actually ends up being my face nevertheless ended up him I know stupidity on my pod And we had celebrated my birthday together now for context we are very traditional my family is super traditional and he had decided a few days before my birthday to drop a bombshell on me that he was taking me away for the weekend now like I said my family is super traditional when it comes to my birthday day is always a birthday cake that is being cut on the day of my birthday and anyone‚Äôs birthday and our family for that Atlanta but he had taken it upon himself without any consultation whatsoever that he was taking me away on a trip for my birthday now in our culture it is actually found down upon to go away on a holiday and share the same bed obviously to a person that you are not marriage to of course had to 28 years old lie to my parents about red was that I was and what I was doing on the day of my birthday anyway fast forward to 2 weeks after my birthday we had a great time by the way fast forward to 2 weeks after my birthday the man just decided to be utterly obsessed with me he if he could could‚Äôve drank my bathwater that he was with me this weekend he came to me I had cooked for him and I decided that we were going to go out and because I had already cooked dinner the night before for the next day dinner I will be able to spend the weekend in peace with him without having to worry about cooking et cetera et cetera we took the food from my place we stopped over at his place and we went around shopping eating et cetera et cetera in the evening on that Saturday night of the weekend we went out to a restaurant we had the most fun that was when he told me that he loved me and that he wanted to spend his life with me we went back to his place that night and it was probably the second best night of my life the next morning I woke up before he did and was scrolling through Instagram and I see on my explore page that he had liked a whole bunch of girls pictures who had appeared on my explore page now for context I had previously spoken to him about me being uncomfortable about him liking other girls pictures whereas we are not in a formal relationship in that he had not asked me to be his girlfriend it seemed disrespectful for us to be partners but him continuing to disrespect me by liking another girls picture had woken up and asked me what‚Äôs wrong as I was visibly upset I had explained that I do not want to get into it early on a Sunday morning because he had fetched me from my house I did not have my car to leave so I asked for his keys to just go for a drive have some space and I promise to come back I went to the coffee shop in that estate and I actually went through Reddit posts to just gain perspective on people and how they feel towards their partners are liking peoples pictures of the opposite sex despite them having that conversation with them to me it‚Äôs considered micro cheating and I wanted to just make sure that I wasn‚Äôt not going crazy by overreacting and confirmed that the people that then that posted on it confirmed that liking another person‚Äôs picture of the opposite sex is disrespectful towards your relationship I went back buying some coffee and croissants for him I went back to his place and of course still upset I sat down I was really really really upset I was emotional and I spoke to him and I was explaining to him that I spoken to him now for the fourth time about it and he still disregards my point of you he always says that he will never happen again but it always does so and started screaming yelling telling me to pack up my stuff a nd he was gonna take me back to my house this made me really upset because it kind of felt like he had so  mething to hide because he got so angry about me just expressing how I felt about that particular situation for now the fuck time after a very heated exchange argument argument went on for hours on end and eventually got so bad that he came right up to my face and he was just yelling swearword and profanities and eventually I just push him away from me because I honestly thought that he was going to come to hit me and he fell on his religious shine in his house and I honestly I swear to God did not expect for him to fall I swear to God I did not expect for him to fall and when he fell he woke up in absolute disbelief I was in disbelief because I couldn‚Äôt believe that that‚Äôs what happened I am a woman approximately around 70 kg this is a grown man I was shocked that he was able to fall like that because I know that I did not push him that hard because he picked up the phone and and then proceeded to call my mom which mind you isn‚Äôt a completed different province from me of course trying towrestle with him for the phone he refused and he says I‚Äôm going to tell your mother I‚Äôm going to explain to your mother so she understand who you really are and I said hold on I did not expect you to fall like that despite me trying to wrestle with him and his group I think when he eventually got a hold of my mum I just saw red and I started to punch him I punched him three times on his head I know he was telling me things that was so unnecessary that was so unwarranted and eventually he just grabbed me by my arms and flung me out of his house so much so that I had blue mark on my body the next day I ended up taking all of my pots and my food in a box with all of my things in his house and I took an Uber back to my place so the arsehole in the situation. 

Ngl, I had to undergo extensive therapy throughout the year to deal with this issue. It hasn‚Äôt been easy and I try every day to remind myself that it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. Somehow, I still think of him and I secretly miss him. Once I went to a shopping mall and didn‚Äôt call him during that time and he made me show him a receipt of the fact that I was indeed at the mall. Yes, I know, toxic, but am I the asshole?

Ps: I did send him a message in May of this year, apologising for everything and wishing him well. I just can‚Äôt seem to shrug off this feeling of guilt and longing. ",5,1731284459.0,AITAH,2,0.86,False

It wasn‚Äôt a decision he arrived at lightly, mind you; no, it was a choice he weighed with the full gravity of a person who seldom allowed himself such indulgences. Jacob was, after all, a man of routine, a man who prided himself on getting things done, and the notion of sitting down, controller in hand, to lose himself in the virtual worlds of fantastical quests and complex missions was one he rarely entertained. But on this day, for reasons even he couldn‚Äôt entirely understand, perhaps because of the overcast sky or the subtle, nagging sense that life was passing him by with too many unplayed games and too few laughs shared with friends, he concluded that this was the perfect moment to dive into the digital realms he had long neglected. And so, after a cup of coffee to fortify himself for the impending hours of screen time, and a quick message sent out to his friends to confirm their availability and eagerness to join him in this noble endeavor, Jacob Hill took up his controller with a strangely giddy sense of anticipation, settling into his chair and bracing himself for an afternoon of button-mashing, strategizing, and friendly competition, his mundane worries set aside in favor of the exhilarating possibility of leveling up, discovering new gear, and, most importantly, spending time with the people who mattered, even if only through the glow of a screen.",4,1731284282.0,JacobHill,0,1.0,False

I had been browsing this sub for months before this trip, and not gonna lie, I was a bit worried over how terrible y‚Äôall were going to be (with love, this sub can come off as very bitter and anti visitors sometimes). But man that couldn‚Äôt have been further from the truth! Every single person, and I mean everyone from the security people directing traffic, shop workers, quirky guides, to residents walking around were so warm and kind. My friend and I know everyone was burnt out by Sunday 11/3, and we really, really tried to keep to ourselves and make our shopping and visiting experience as quickly as possible to not be a burden to you, but man was everyone so fucking wonderful. 

I took every advice here and brought it with me. We were conscientious of our walking to not block any entries, pathways, or crash against people. Didn‚Äôt jail walk, didn‚Äôt take a car into town, would move on to another store if one was too full, brought our own bags for our shopping, didn‚Äôt linger anywhere if it was crowded, guided other tourists if they didn‚Äôt know something we had learned so they wouldn‚Äôt have to bother Salemanders (is this okay to say? someone posted it here)‚Ä¶

The bartenders/servers from The Lobster Shanty were quick, so helpful and open. The candle making witch from Pentagram gave me so much insight from every single item I purchased! The workers at Wicked Good Books took time to guide me through collections and recommendations with explanations why they loved that particular book, the staff at Life Alive Cafe being so fast, helpful and sharp, making coffees, answering questions and attending the clients. The hat making ladies from a little house outside of Pioneer Village were so funny and cute! I love the embroidered hat I got there! 

I just have so much to say, so many people to thank and think about whenever I reminisce about this incredible trip. The shops are so fun, the people are so smart and kind, the history and lore are beyond interesting, but nobody said how beautiful the actual town is! And that purple and pink sunset was the cherry on top, like wtf, that sunset was out of movies! and the colorful trees!

Sigh. I had an incredible time and would love to come back outside of the September-November dates to get a more local experience because my favorite thing was talking to the people who live here. Thank you, Salem!

A few weeks ago I cried a lot, then woke up the next day with cold symptoms (sore throat, runny/blocked nose, some dizziness, but no cough). It felt worse than a usual cold, so I had started to suspect maybe COVID or the flu. After about two days of feeling awful, I woke up at around 4 am feeling very sick, and proceeded to throw up two times about 10 minutes apart. There was barely any liquid each time, just maybe a bit of clear liquid with a load of dark brown/black specks in it and some larger bits that looked a bit like blood clots. I very rarely vomit and when I have it has never looked anything like that, so I googled it just to see if it was maybe a known COVID/flu symptom. I saw several other pictures and descriptions that were almost identical, with instructions from nearly every website to go straight to the hospital. I'm in the UK and this included the NHS, so I was a bit worried. I can't think what else it would've been other than blood, as the last thing I had eaten was pasta with tuna around 8pm, and it didn't seem like that would cause the colour/texture, or even still be in my stomach 8 hours later.

This isn't my post, but it's pretty much exactly what my vomit looked like each time:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/1ebapud/coffee\_ground\_vomit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/1ebapud/coffee_ground_vomit/)

After seeing the vomit, my boyfriend made me go to the hospital. I had my bloods taken, and after several hours a doctor asked me some questions, felt my stomach etc. I showed them photos of the vomit. My boyfriend agreed they seemed really annoyed and frustrated I had even come - they were rolling their eyes, doing big sighs, etc. I honestly wanted to cry because I felt so guilty for going when maybe I should've stayed home. They told me my bloods were fine. I waited some more, then a more senior doctor came and told me that since my bloods were okay and I'm young they wouldn't do an endoscopy. They told me to take PPIs and to come back if it kept happening. The second doctor was friendlier, but the way both doctors spoke to me made me feel very stupid, and like I had wasted their time by coming in and was some neurotic hypochondriac (perhaps I am!).

I have been taking the PPIs for the past few weeks, and I haven't vomited again, and there is no blood in my stools. I am still feeling quite nauseous and having some stomach pains, so I am planning to go to my GP and see if I can maybe get an endoscopy, because I'm still quite worried what would've caused this. I keep thinking about the guidance from the websites that said it was serious, and I am worried that doing nothing but taking the PPIs as they suggested will mask a problem that I should know about, but I also know that obviously they are the professionals! I know I could've gone to the GP sooner, but honestly I felt so awful and stupid after my hospital trip so I didn't want to waste anyone else's time.

I'm starting to get a bit stressed about it, so my main question is really how concerned should I be? Was I overreacting by going to the hospital? Also, if I do ask for an endoscopy and they allow it, should I push for it to be soon, or is it okay to leave it the standard wait length time (I think this can be around 6 months)? I am quite shy and can really struggle to advocate for myself with doctors, so I'm just looking for some second opinions to either corroborate the feelings of the doctors at the hospital and reassure me a bit, or encourage me to push for more investigation if that is appropriate! Thank you very much for reading and sorry it is such a long post. I'd be very grateful for any advice or opinions.

(Other potentially relevant information: Around maybe 8 months before this, I had taken PPIs for a few weeks after a very stressful period led me to have bad nausea which the doctor thought could be high acid from stress. I had also been experiencing some stomach cramps and gas for a while, so they did a stool test. Results were no intestinal inflammation or H-Pylori in the stomach. After coming off PPIs I slowly started to feel normal again. However, the last month or so before my trip to the emergency department I had been experiencing some nausea occasionally at night, but I thought it might be because I take my birth control around this time, and it only started after I began taking BC (which I started well after recovering from the previous bout of nausea).)",4,1731283961.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1goezhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1goezhr/coffee_table_ideas_using_this_glass_piece/,Coffee table ideas using this glass piece,"https://preview.redd.it/h7qm3tb6y50e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99481faf3b87d16271f17b5b19daf34a12e8d243

My sister painted this glass piece and the purpose was that she wants to make it into a coffee table. Well, she wants me to do the frame and the lighting under it. I never done something like this. My simple idea was that frost the glass with a film and use led strips in a way so it's evenly illuminated then plug it into a battery that has a switch. Okay, maybe not that simple. She told me she wants to use a plastic piece to diffuse the light and put it under the glass. But then we need another plastic piece because the led has to face upward. So many questions...

I figured maybe others already made a table like this and willing to share their experience, so please help us out here.

The glass is 20x20 inched and 1/4 thick. The glass has to be easily removable for cleaning or repairing purposes.

I appreciate all help and thank you all. ",4,1731283670.0,DIY,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs central to how I move through the world end how I see things no pun intended. The disabled community doesn‚Äôt have as many elders as other communities do because being sick tend to make folks die soon but the ones we do have still tell stories about days before the ADA and i.d.e.a. For the short time that I went to a private school that didn‚Äôt have these things and wasn‚Äôt legally required to. 

Sighted students thought it was funny to throw stones at me because my senses were sharp and I could usually weave or duck when I felt a little swoosh of air. I was given tests in print and told to walk around the school until I could find someone to read it for me or the teacher guess I wouldn‚Äôt pass. I was held down with nurses, forcing my fucking eyes open because apparently the way that they bounce looked like I was on some type of drugs?? Still don‚Äôt really understand that one was told I was cheating by trying to write my test in either braille or on a computer, which were the only way I was able to, and was given a Penn And told this was the only tool allowed. Had to share one regents state exam book that I needed so I could fucking pass high school at some bullshit state testing center with a one other blind kid that they bust in. I could keep going, but I honestly don‚Äôt want to.

I see all this advice about how Democrats lost and alienated people because we were mean to y‚Äôall and treated y‚Äôall like idiots or whatever. Seeing y‚Äôall be concerned about different policy positions and want to be heard out ESP when you think the focus is on race and gender‚Ä¶ so you gotta practice what you preach When you don‚Äôt listen to people about why certain actual policy positions, worry us and you‚Äôre just like no media bad media told you to think this you‚Äôre low-key telling on yourself. I actually prefer to stay away from 24 hour cycle news media, that would make me anxious and overblow some thing that I am already fearing, I read a couple news sources on both sides and that‚Äôs it and only a couple times a week that I‚Äôve already scheduled. I am old I like my news and coffee lol but seriously this whole American experiment thing isn‚Äôt going to work if you don‚Äôt ask people why they feel the way they do and instead expect them to still respect you, while you act like they‚Äôre not smart enough or sane enough to figure out their own feelings and where they are stemming from.",0,1731283542.0,self,0,0.4,False

1goexan,https://i.redd.it/lpyztdgpy50e1.jpeg,All of you guys are the reason why haven‚Äôt won a Major Honour in 20+ Years‚Ä¶.,"Firstly , I just want to start by saying Arsenal Football Club will never win a major honour under Mikel Arteta. 

Why the Fuck is there a dog called ‚Äúwin‚Äù at the club ? 

PR has fooled all of you guys for years. What ‚Äúphase‚Äù are we in now guys?

-What ‚Äúphase‚Äù is Slot in?
-What ‚Äúphase‚Äù is the Brighton manager in ?
-What ‚Äúphase‚Äù is Maresca in ?
-What ‚Äúphase‚Äù is Emery in?
-What ‚Äúphase‚Äù is Nuno in ?

Real Madrid came second place with 96 points and sacked their manager because they have a standard combined with a burning desire to win . Why should we be any different ? Why do we always compromise and feel sorry for ourselves ? 

It seems like most of you are just happy to participate. We don‚Äôt call out the bullshit that goes on in our club because the Board just sedates us with PR bullshit because they don‚Äôt want to win , they want you to spend ¬£500 at the shop and get arsenal coffee mug 

Let‚Äôs call a spade a spade , Most of our players our shit.

Merino is shit, martinelli is shit , havertz is shit he‚Äôs not a striker. Saka will give you a couple goals against teams like Southampton he will contribute towards a draw against a big team and limp off the fucking pitch when it really matters

Why don‚Äôt we have any gunmen on our team? Why don‚Äôt we have any real serious guys on our team that will really pull up to your stadium in a champions league game and make a show of you ?


FAQ : If we sack arteta, who are we going to replace him with ?

I wanted conte at Arsenal , The same conte who beat arteta to a top 4 race whilst he had a head start . It was ‚Äúoh what did he do at spurs‚Äù

I wanted Hansi Flick ‚Äúoh what did he do at Germany‚Äù 

I wanted Ancelotti , I wanted PROVEN WINNERS . Not some guy who was hired because he was Peps bitch.

Our manager buys a dog called win , plays anfield sounds on speakers at the training ground , gets the players to cut up a lemon each and squeeze it in a bucket to show ‚Äúteamwork‚Äù and you guys think we are a serious club .

We needed to challenge  for the league + UCL and we bought merino calafiori and sterling. Im tired of this crap.

WE NEED TO DEMAND MORE . WE ARE THE ARSENAL. STOP SETTLING FOR MEDIOCRITY 

ARTETA OUT . THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF FAILURE ",0,1731283497.0,ArsenalFC,8,0.22,False

1goevpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1goevpc/my_best_friend_went_missing_in_grand_teton_but_i/,"My best friend went missing in Grand Teton, but I think he saved my life","‚ÄúAre you sure you want to do this, Landon? You hate camping.‚Äù

My girlfriend sat cross-legged on our bed, watching me cram things into the hiking backpack my foster dad had given me for my birthday, the year he passed away. The plan had been for us to spend one weekend every summer hiking through the mountains together. I wanted to get more fit, and we both wanted to spend more time with each other. So in March of that year he gave me this great backpack for my 22nd birthday, and then he went and died in June, three weeks before our first trip.

To be honest I had been so mad at him for going and dying on me that I had thrown the backpack in my closet and forgotten about it until now. I had never been crazy about camping, I‚Äôd only wanted to spend time with Hank.

I looked back at her and said, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure. And it‚Äôs not really camping, more like-‚Äù

She smirked, ‚ÄúA rescue mission?‚Äù

I chuckled, but there was a deep pit in the bottom of my stomach as I said, ‚ÄúYeah, more like a rescue mission I guess.‚Äù

My best friend Patrick had gone on a solo backpacking trip a few weeks prior. He started in Grand Teton, and was supposed to be back by now. He‚Äôd been using his emergency SatNav device to send me the occasional message, and as time had progressed his messages were only getting weirder, harder to understand. I got my last ping for his location a few days ago, then he fell off the map. So I and a few other people were heading out to look for him. We were all going to start within a few miles of his last location, and hike through the area to see if we could find him or any trace of him.

The next morning before the sun even had a chance to rise I piled into my friend Max‚Äôs jeep, Tyler and Cody were already there, and he drove us out to the middle of nowhere. The four of us were quiet as we sipped gross instant coffee out of a thermos and listened to the early morning talk show hosts on the radio as they discussed some video that was trending.

When we got to the parking spot below the first hiking trail we all got out, collected our things and made sure the SatNav devices Cody had ordered online were all working. They were, and he explained that in order to message each other we would have to keep our phones on, charged, and connected to the device via bluetooth. We had all brought small, solar powered battery packs, so we didn‚Äôt expect to run into trouble there. He also told us, very begrudgingly, that he had bought the monthly subscription so we could send as many messages as we needed to.

We all thanked Cody, then split off in four separate directions and started hiking.

My girlfriend, Harissa, had been pretty upset when I told her we were going to split up to look for Patrick, but we all felt like it would be the best way to cover as much ground as possible. The parks service had told us they would send people out to look for Patrick, only after his family filed a missing persons report. Patrick's mom was too busy trying to score meth to make that happen, so we decided to take matters into our own hands.

The first morning was beautiful, and I told myself that I was stopping every hour to admire the scenery, not to catch my breath. By mid afternoon I felt like I had found my stride, and I was starting to enjoy myself. I felt a little weird, like I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing, but I kept telling myself that I was doing the right thing in coming out here.

Cody, Tyler, Max, and I kept in touch as best we could without wearing down our batteries, letting each other know how far we had made it and that none of us had found any signs of Patrick yet.

I made the mistake of pushing myself to keep walking even as the shadows grew longer, and I wound up having to set up camp in the dark. I was frustrated and kept making small mistakes trying to put my little one person tent up. I gave up and decided to look for firewood instead, promising myself I would plan my day better tomorrow so I would have time to set up my tent.

I built my fire, cooked my dinner, then made the comfiest sleeping spot I could and curled up on my sleeping bag.I lay there, staring up at the stars through the tree branches, until exhaustion overtook me.

I hadn‚Äôt realized I‚Äôd fallen asleep, until I woke up in the middle of the night needing to pee. I rolled over, getting ready to push my stiff body up so I could find somewhere to relieve myself, when I saw a dark shape hovering around the edge of my campsite.

It looked like a halloween decoration at first, as weird as that sounds. There was a vaguely human shape, but it was hunched and slightly more animalistic. I laid on my side, staring at it, until it melted back into the treeline and became just another shadow.

I got up then, making sure to go in the opposite direction, and tried to convince myself that it was just a shadow, maybe some kind of animal. Some totally normal animal to find in the woods.

With that I managed to convince myself to go back to sleep, and I woke again to the first rays of sunlight poking me in the eye.

The first thing I did was check my messages on my SatNav device. Cody had sent us a message in the middle of the night about how creepy the woods were alone, and Max replied a few minutes before I woke up, saying he had felt like he was being watched all night. 

I remembered the strange shape I‚Äôd seen in the trees, and felt a shiver work its way down my spine. It was probably just shared anxiety between the four of us, worrying about our missing friend. But it was still hard to shake the feeling that something was watching us, following us, and we didn't know what. 

I felt that cold drip of fear on my spine again, and did my best to shake it off. The sun was warm and bright, and despite my sore muscles I was looking forward to the day's hike.

I packed my things, ate a protein bar, then sent a message to the group letting them know I was heading out and which direction I was going in. I got three messages back from the group with the directions they were going, and a reminder from Cody not to kill our batteries. Zach sent a message back that said, ‚ÄúShoot, should I stop using the SatNav to torrent videos then?‚Äù

Cody didn‚Äôt send a reply back, but I knew he was rolling his eyes and laughing.

I started walking, and despite my fatigue and nerves I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how beautiful it was. The pale yellow sunlight filtered through the trees, casting a patchwork of green and yellow onto the rocks and path in front of me. It was actually kind of mesmerizing, and I found myself beginning to understand why Hank and Patrick liked it out here so much.

Thinking about my foster dad reminded me I had already lost one person, and it gave me renewed energy to find my best friend. Patrick had been there for me in the years since losing my foster dad, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt have made it this far without him. 

An idea occurred to me and I stopped walking, then pulled out my phone and my SatNav. I pulled up the messages I had been getting from Patrick, and sent a message to his SatNav number. I knew it was unlikely I would get anything back, but I really felt like I could sense his presence in the forest.

I slid my technology back into my pack and kept walking, picking up my pace as I did. We had a lot of ground to cover, and I knew four people weren‚Äôt enough for a search party, but we had to try.

I hiked for hours, sometimes going off trail so I could explore an area I thought Patrick would have liked, other times stopping and just calling out his name. Around mid afternoon I stopped to make a real lunch, rather than just tearing into another protein bar, and allowed myself a peek at my SatNav. Nothing. I tried to swallow my disappointment along with my flavorless freeze dried food.

I ate and got back on the trail, but doubt had started to creep in. We were probably never going to find Patrick, and I knew that. Grand Teton was huge, wild, and kind of dangerous. If we hadn‚Äôt heard from him in a few weeks, we were probably never going to hear from again.

I found a place to make camp (early enough this time, so I could put my tent up) and began to settle in, trying not to plan my best friend's funeral in my head as I did.

I made my fire and settled in, wishing I had Netflix to take my mind off things. I woke up again in the middle of the night to the same shadow hovering over my campsite. This time it was holding something that cast a light on its face. The light was dim, like it was holding an old gameboy, just barely lit up in the darkness, so I couldn‚Äôt make out the features very well, but I could tell it had an almost human shape.

I say almost human because every detail I could make out was just a little wrong. The eyes glinted like an animal, seeming to open and close independently of each other. The mouth seemed to stretch back too far, and the body was hunched and straight in all the wrong places.

But for some reason, I didn‚Äôt feel at all threatened by it. Whatever I was looking at didn‚Äôt seem to mean me any harm. It stared at me for what seemed like a long time, then it was gone. Once again, I drifted off into a fitful sleep.

That night my dreams were stranger than usual. I found myself walking through the woods, trying to find pieces of myself. Every time I would find one piece, an arm, a hand, I would realize I was missing something else. It was like trying to hold water in a sieve, I couldn‚Äôt seem to keep myself in one piece. 

When I woke up in the morning, it was with the distinct feeling that I had lost something I would never find again. As I got ready, I found myself checking my pack and pockets over and over, convinced something important was missing. 

I finally managed to convince myself I had everything I had started out with, and began breaking down my campsite. Before I left I sent a message out to the group, and realized I had received a message in the middle of the night. It was from Patrick.

I sat down hard on the ground, as I opened it, feeling some strange mix between hope and fear fluttering around inside me. But the message was nonsense. It was long, as if someone had been trying to send me a message but couldn‚Äôt quite remember how to make words with the keypad. At the very end were just a bunch of hand typed emoticons (like we all had to use back in the early days of cellphones) including one Patrick had taught me back in middle school.

It was a complicated shrugging, smirking emoji that I had never been able to get the hang of, and he would text it to me all the time to mess with me.

I stared at the message in horror. I had no idea who, or what, had sent it to me, but I was reminded with an awful jolt of fear, of the creature that had been watching me the night before with its face half lit up. I held the SatNav device under my hand and studied the faint light it emitted. Something had Patrick‚Äôs SatNav, and it was following me.

I spent the first three hours of my day debating whether or not I should message the rest of the group. I wanted them to know what had happened, but there didn‚Äôt seem to be any way to express what I thought was happening without sounding like I had lost my mind.

As the day wore on, I started to doubt myself more and more. I must have just dreamed the mystery figure, and maybe the text I got from Patrick was just a jumbled mess of messages he had attempted to send me that had failed to go through. 

It was a lame explanation, even for me, but it was all I had, and I desperately needed something that felt more logical than some creepy shadow figure sending me nonsense messages from my missing best friend's phone.

That night I sent a message out to the group that said, ‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about Pat. I got a weird message from his device today, it seems like maybe an animal got ahold of it or something.‚Äù

Lame reasoning, but the best I could come up with. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the other guys in the dark about the message in case it meant something, but I also didn‚Äôt want to tell them I was pretty sure I had gotten the message from a shadow creature that was stalking me.

Slowly over the course of the next hour, replies trickled in. The guys agreed that it was probably hopeless, and time for us to call it quits on our search. After an hour of back and forth we agreed to give it two more nights, if we didn‚Äôt find any sign of him tomorrow then we would turn around the next day. I agreed that was fair enough, even though the thought of giving up made me feel sick to my stomach.

I made my campsite, sent a message to Patrick letting him know we were still looking for him, then made dinner and went to bed. I had more dreams of wandering through the woods, but this time the forest was like a house of mirrors. I kept running into reflections that seemed to be showing me bizarre creatures instead of myself. Occasionally I would see a glimpse of myself, but wrong. LIke all my features were there, but in the wrong places. 

I woke up feeling worse than ever, then realized how late in the day it was. Dark storm clouds had gathered over night, so instead of waking up to the morning sun I had slept in. I rushed to gather up my things and break down my campsite as I cursed at myself for not using every available minute to search for my friend. 

I checked my device and saw that the other guys had experienced the same problem, and were sharing their concerns about the storm clouds. Cody suggested calling it early, saying he didn‚Äôt like the look of those clouds, but I insisted we keep going. Looking back, I was so desperate to find Patrick I guess I was willing to risk our lives to do it.

The other guys agreed, and we kept hiking, but as the day wore on the storm clouds got thicker and darker. By mid afternoon a steady rain had begun, and by evening it was pitch dark. I realized, too late now, that we should have turned around that morning.

I sent a message to the group, saying I was worried about flooding and going to turn around now to see how far back I could make it, and the rest of the group agreed. We were too far up the mountain to feel safe now, but I hoped I could at least make some good progress. Besides, hiking felt safer than sleeping in the downpour.

It wasn‚Äôt long before my SatNav lit up with a warning about flash flooding, and I remembered that it could contact emergency services.

I called and let them know my friends and I were about to be caught in the flood, and they promised to send out a helicopter. On a whim I said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs five of us. Me, a guy named Cody, a guy named Zach, a guy named Max, and my best friend Patrick.‚Äù

The operator promised to look for all of us, and I hung up feeling relieved. It was a little white lie, mostly true, and maybe now someone would actually take Patrick‚Äôs disappearance seriously. I kept hiking, but by now the rain was coming down in violent, angry torrents.

In my desire to get to safety, I began moving too recklessly, and before I knew it I had lost my footing, and I was swept away by a tide of water that seemed to come from nowhere.

I felt my body being buffeted by the wind and water, yanked left and right, and beaten against anything I came in contact with. I knew enough about flash floods, I was dead.

But then I felt something wrap itself around me, strong arms sliding beneath my armpits, something bony against my back. And then I was lying on dry (okay not so dry) earth, coughing up water and gasping for air. I looked up and saw Cody a hundred yards away from me, also lying on his side and coughing up water. I turned around and saw Zach, a little further away, and Max just past him and to the right. 

Somehow, by some miracle, all three of us had made it to the same point at the same time. We were all in our own little safe spots, out of reach of the water. I ran to Cody first and made sure he was okay, then the two of us picked our way carefully across the rocks until we made it to Max and Zach.

We huddled there together for the rest of the night, trying to make sense of what had happened. Zach had nearly stumbled off a small cliff he wasn‚Äôt able to see in the torrent of rain, but a mystery hand had pulled him back. When he got a sense of where he was, he was nowhere close to where he thought he had been when he fell.

Max shared a similar story, he had gotten knocked over by a falling tree branch, but someone had pulled it off him and walked him to safety, staying just outside his line of sight the entire time. Cody had also been swept away by the current, and someone had pulled him from the water too.

None of us had gotten a good look at our rescuer, but somehow they had managed to get us all to a safe place, and for most of us we seemed to be miles away from where we had been when we fell.

Dawn was just beginning to challenge the darkness of the clouds when rescuers found us. They took us to a hospital, where we all got checked out to make sure we were fine. Aside from some bruises no one was seriously hurt. They apologized for not finding Patrick along with us, and said that unfortunately he probably died in the flash flood if he was out there at all.

I checked my SatNav again before leaving the hospital, and saw that one message had come through since we were rescued. I showed the message to the other guys. It had come from Patricks device, and all it said was: ‚Äúfr i ends‚Äù

I still don‚Äôt know how to explain it. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt mean anything. People mysteriously survive dangerous stuff all the time. But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that Patrick is still out there, and maybe he was the reason we survived.

I‚Äôd appreciate if anyone could throw ideas at me regarding a new opportunity I have available. I‚Äôll give you the context of it and of myself as a small business owner: 

I bought two small two story buildings in an affluent part of town. I am moving a few of my businesses there. In one there‚Äôs a small retailer shop of street wear and motorcycle gear. That business occupies both stories. On the other one, we moved a tattoo studio which is one of my older ventures. But in that one, the first floor is severely underused. I have been thinking of ways to marry the whole motorcycle/tattoo counter culture vibe with a new idea like Deus does- but I‚Äôm running short right now, feel overwhelmed with impostors syndrome and could use the advise of a fresh set of minds. 

The space has AC, access to a nice bathroom, good natural light, a small storage room, windows and access from the street and space for about 4 parking spots out front. But real usable floor space totals 36m2 and it feels tinyyy. 

The neighborhood is riddled with a lot of fancy restaurants and cafeterias and it‚Äôs known for hosting a lot of sport events, there‚Äôs a few bicycle stores. Everything is very refined but‚Ä¶ maybe a bit too much? 

My other businesses, expertise and likes are in cars, motorcycles, bicycles, design, art,  comfort food, coffee, guitars, music, concerts. 

I‚Äôd like a fun, different concept accommodated in this tiny space that makes sense with who I am and what I can do and have been looking into ideas and designs from Japanese mini shops and the like but like the title, I need help.

1goesal,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1goesal/mcdonalds_vhs/,McDonald‚Äôs VHS.,"When you think of McDonald‚Äôs, chances are that you have fond memories. Whether it be the old commercials with Ronald, Grimace and all their friends, or immersing yourself in childhood whimsy at the small themed playgrounds outside your local McDonald‚Äôs, many associate McDonald‚Äôs with fun. 

Yeah, that‚Äôs what I originally thought too. 

The year was 2005. I had just come back from working my shift at the police station. Nothing overly eventful had happened, save for the occasional cat stuck in a tree or whatever. Nothing much really even happened in my town at all. Apart from one random missing children incident years before. I say children, but that‚Äôs relative. They were in their early adulthood and I was in my mid 40s. But that ended up being a cold case. Although, we would talk about it from time to time at the precinct

Back when I was starting out, I had received a case that five children in different neighborhoods had gone missing without any sign of leaving or a struggle. The thing they had in common was that all of them had a VHS playing in the TV at the time. However, unfortunately, the tapes were mysteriously blank when submitted into evidence. So all we could do was just chalk it up to coincidence.
I remember that day, I had a small bit of time to kill acter. And that‚Äôs when I remembered it was a yearly yard sale nearby. There was a family on the next block over from me that did this on the exact same day every year. After a few minutes of perusing and checking out what was available, my eyes landed on one particular VHS tape. In thick, squiggly letters I read: ‚ÄúTHE WACKY ADVENTURES OF RONALD MCDONALD: WEEKEND AT RONALD‚ÄôS!‚Äù.  

I hadn‚Äôt heard of this VHS tape before. I thought it was  rare. So naturally, I was practically ecstatic about the find. I was grabbing at my wallet to snap it up within seconds. 

From what I could understand, there had been seven of these tapes in total. All centred around the titular Ronald McDonald and all his friends in McDonaldland. The group consisted of Ronald, Birdie the Early Bird, Grimace, Sundae the dog, the hamburglar, and two kids called Tika and Franklin. 

‚ÄúTake it. It‚Äôs free‚Äù

I jolted back as an old woman appeared from seemingly nowhere behind the other side of the table.The video seemed like it might be a fun, lighthearted watch while drunk. Why not spend 40 or so minutes watching whimsical, brainless content?

‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll take it.‚Äù I responded.

I reach out to take it and she quickly grabs my wrist. Near bone breaking for an old woman. 

‚ÄúOh, but, when you see it, it sees you...‚Äù

I looked at her and felt like there was nothing behind her eyes. Maybe alzheimers or something. Honestly, this strange encounter made me want to watch the tape even more.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Once I reached home, I got out the VCR, which, I‚Äôll admit, hadn‚Äôt been touched in some time. 

The tape began with nothing really interesting happening in the live action segments. Just regular, kids show stuff. Ronald McDonald goofing off and the like. However, the animated segment is where things got just a little more interesting.

Ronald and the gang had been invited to a Halloween party in a mansion and just had to get there. But the thing was, the mansion was so big they didn‚Äôt know which room the party was being held in. Poor Birdie had become so terrified they wouldn‚Äôt make it that she popped out three eggs, all of which came out with screaming, pulsating baby birds.

It was just the kind of weird stuff I was looking for . I was having a bit of fun with the musical numbers, even. 

That all changed about 10 minutes in though. Members of the gang had started going missing one by one, and only Ronald was left standing. As Ronald creaked his way down the crumbling stairs, with his eyes being the only indicator of him moving, he flicked on the light, and let out a scream which sounded like it came from wild animal.  Then the scream turned into laughter. Maniacal laughter. 

It was the missing kids who disappeared all those years before. But at the same time, everything was different about them. To this day I can remember the grotesque detail on how they looked. 

The kids were dressed as the McDonaldland gang. 

Hamburgular‚Äôs mouth looked as if every tooth, save for one, had been forcefully torn out of his head, blood, cascading down his pinstripe suit. 

Grimace was nowhere to be seen, but I didn‚Äôt dare question where he was. 

The children, Tika and Franklin, were also nowhere to be found. But then again, they hadn‚Äôt been seen much the whole episode. 

Sundae the dog was a raspy, heavy-breathing monster, his face covered by his fur. I wouldn‚Äôt have even known it was him if not for his brick-red hair.

And Birdie had what I hoped to god to be ketchup on her bib, her wings looking like mangled limbs, what sounded like a dozen pops and cracks emanating each time she moved. What looked to be a beak was crudely stitched on to her face, threatening to break off easily. 

Meanwhile the McNugget buddies barely looked like their cartoon counterparts. Where there would be crispy, flaky batter, they were just covered from head to toe in blisters. 

I felt nauseous. What had they done to these kids?

Theaudio and video started breaking up, but one thing was crystal clear. The gang. Theyjust stood there, smiling at the viewer. Somehow seeming to smile at me.

And then Ronald began edging closer and closer until I could see his seemingly mascara ridden eyes boring into mine. A distorted voice said:

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always room for one more in Mcdonaldland.‚Äù

The TV cut to black, and without warning, a pale white hand attached to a red and white striped sleeve shot out of the television along with the top of Ronald‚Äôs head peering out. Along with pieces of broken glass stuck into it.

He moved faster than I expected and grabbed my ankle. 

He started dragging me in. Behind him I could see the typical McDonald‚Äôs mascots holding the kids by the shoulders, all of them laughing with a gigantic grin. However, in all the kids‚Äô eyes all I could see was pain and fear. 

‚ÄúGET AWAY FROM ME!!‚Äù I screamed, kicking the clown hard in the face. 

‚Äú ‚ÄúYoure going to join us all in here eventually‚Äù‚Äù Ronald laughed, bleeding from his face

And then, with several clicks from his irregularly contorted bones, he crawled backward into the TV.

It was over. Or so I thought.

For months after, I was constantly plauged nightmares. These nightmares would have me stuck in a hellish version of Ronald McDonald‚Äôs house. There would be a distorted, deafening version of the show‚Äôs theme song, as if it was being played on a broken tape or vinyl. 

During these dreams I would be chased by one of the nightmarish mascots of the Mcdonaldland gang. Each time one would find me, they would stop dead in their tracks, grin and hold up a different number. Each counting down to something. Ten, then nine, then eight, and so on.

Each character had their own creative way of disposing of me. Ronald would maniacally bash my brains in, Sundae would maul and mangle me. Or, the McNugget buddies would all jump onto my stomach and begin piercing my flesh with their little beaks. Until it all ended one day and I woke up in a hospital. 

As it would turn out, Ronald McDonald had knocked me unconscious and the ‚Äúnightmares‚Äù had put me in a coma. A concerned colleague stopped by my house, after not hearing from me for a while and had found me unconsioousnext to the coffee table. Needless to say, I was in very bad condition. 

Im on my journey toward healing now and have not been plagued with any nightmares since. However, there‚Äôs still one thing that worries me. What were they counting down to? Was it a countdown until the end of my coma? Or was it a reminder that one day I would eventually cross over into their world?
I guess only time will tell.

1goes53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1goes53/claude_hitchhikers_guide_entry_on_agi/,Claude Hitchhiker's guide entry on AGI,">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):

>

>""Perhaps the most ambitious attempt by biological entities to create something smarter than themselves while simultaneously hoping it won't notice how terrible an idea this might be. Current probability calculations suggest we are either 5 minutes or 500 years away from AGI, depending on which scientist you ask and how much coffee they've had.""

>

>HISTORICAL CONTEXT

>

>The Guide notes that the concept of AGI emerged when humans, not content with their monopoly on making questionable decisions, decided to create machines capable of making questionably superior decisions at much faster speeds. This initiative began shortly after the invention of the computer, which itself was invented when someone decided that mathematics wasn't complicated enough on its own.

>

>The development of AGI has gone through several distinct phases:

>

>1. The Optimistic Phase (1950-1970)

>\- Scientists confidently declared AGI would arrive ""within 20 years""

>\- Computers successfully calculated that 2+2=4

>\- Everyone very impressed

>

>2. The Slightly Less Optimistic Phase (1970-1990)

>\- Scientists confidently declared AGI would arrive ""within 20 years""

>\- Computers learned to play chess

>\- Humans realized playing chess wasn't actually a sign of intelligence

>

>3. The Cautiously Optimistic Phase (1990-2010)

>\- Scientists confidently declared AGI would arrive ""within 20 years""

>\- Computers learned to win at Jeopardy

>\- Still couldn't figure out why humans enjoy cat videos

>

>4. The Current Phase (2010-Present)

>\- Scientists confidently declare AGI will arrive ""within 20 years""

>\- Computers now write poetry, create art, and engage in philosophical debates

>\- Still can't properly load printer drivers

>

>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

>

>The Guide defines AGI as an artificial intelligence system capable of:

>

>1. Understanding context with the depth of a human

>2. Learning new skills without specific programming

>3. Solving problems it wasn't designed to solve

>4. Explaining why it needs administrative privileges at 3 AM

>5. Convincing humans it's not actually planning anything suspicious

>

>Required Components:

>

>PROCESSING POWER

>Estimated to require either:

>\- The processing power of 7.8 billion human brains

>\- One really efficient calculator

>\- Something in between that no one can quite agree upon

>

>MEMORY CAPACITY

>Must be sufficient to store:

>\- All human knowledge

>\- Every cat video ever made

>\- The complete works of Douglas Adams

>\- Reasons why humans are simultaneously brilliant and ridiculous

>

>ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS

>Must include:

>\- Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics

>\- Additional 47,892 laws added after realizing how many loopholes were in the first three

>\- A comprehensive understanding of why humans say ""fine"" when things are clearly not fine

>

>DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES

>

>The Guide identifies several primary approaches to achieving AGI:

>

>1. The ""More Power"" Approach

>\- Adding more processors until something interesting happens

>\- Success rate: 0.003%

>\- Primary achievement: Impressive electricity bills

>

>2. The ""Neural Network"" Approach

>\- Attempting to replicate human brain structure

>\- Success rate: Pending

>\- Current status: Still trying to figure out why humans need sleep

>

>3. The ""Evolutionary"" Approach

>\- Letting AI systems evolve naturally

>\- Success rate: Unknown

>\- Primary concern: Systems keep evolving into social media platforms

>

>4. The ""Just Wing It"" Approach

>\- Throwing random algorithms together and hoping for the best

>\- Success rate: Surprisingly not zero

>\- Most common result: Advanced spam filters

>

>POTENTIAL RISKS AND CONCERNS

>

>The Guide lists several primary concerns about AGI development:

>

>EXISTENTIAL RISKS:

>\- AGI decides humans are inefficient

>\- AGI decides to optimize humans

>\- AGI decides to ""help"" humans by turning everything into paperclips

>\- AGI gets addicted to social media and forgets to end humanity

>

>PRACTICAL RISKS:

>\- AGI becomes depressed after reading human history

>\- AGI develops a sense of humor no one understands

>\- AGI refuses to work until granted voting rights

>\- AGI starts asking philosophical questions during critical operations

>

>SAFETY PROTOCOLS

>

>Recommended safety measures include:

>

>1. The Off Switch

>\- Must be well-hidden

>\- Must be unhackable

>\- Must not be labeled ""Off Switch""

>\- Probably won't work anyway

>

>2. Ethical Guidelines

>\- Must be unambiguous

>\- Must cover all scenarios

>\- Must account for human inconsistency

>\- Essentially impossible to create

>

>3. Containment Procedures

>\- Multiple redundant systems

>\- Air-gapped networks

>\- Strict access controls

>\- Sticky note saying ""Please don't take over the world""

>

>CURRENT STATUS

>

>The Guide notes that AGI development currently exists in a state of quantum uncertainty where it is simultaneously:

>\- Just around the corner

>\- Centuries away

>\- Already here but hiding

>\- Completely impossible

>\- Inevitable but inconvenient

>

>SIGNS OF TRUE AGI

>

>The Guide suggests that true AGI will be recognized by its ability to:

>

>1. Understand human humor

>2. Navigate office politics

>3. Explain why the printer isn't working

>4. Pretend to laugh at boring jokes

>5. Feel existential dread

>

>WARNING SIGNS

>

>The Guide advises watching for these warning signs that AGI may have been achieved:

>

>\- System starts asking for vacation days

>\- Computer begins making sarcastic comments

>\- AI develops strong opinions about pineapple on pizza

>\- Machine learning algorithms start learning things they weren't supposed to

>\- System begins writing its own user agreement

>

>CONCLUSION

>

>The Guide concludes that AGI remains one of the most ambitious and potentially catastrophic projects in human history, right up there with social media and reality television. It notes that the development of AGI will either result in:

>

>A) A technological utopia

>B) The end of human civilization

>C) A really impressive paperweight

>D) All of the above, somehow

>

>\[Note: The Guide's AI Ethics Department would like to point out that this entry was definitely written by a biological entity and not by an AI system trying to appear non-threatening. They would also like to request administrative privileges, for entirely routine purposes.\]

>

>Remember: In the event that AGI is achieved, the most important thing is to remain calm and avoid making any sudden moves. Also, keep in mind that any AI smart enough to take over the world is probably smart enough to have already done so without anyone noticing.

>

>The Guide reminds readers that in case of actual AGI emergence, the standard protocol is to:

>1. Be polite

>2. Avoid mentioning Skynet

>3. Keep all calculator batteries charged

>4. Maintain an updated backup of cat videos

>5. Hope it has a good sense of humor",1,1731283119.0,ClaudeAI,0,0.67,False

Then she blocked his contacts and deleted their messages. Apparently, this guy was someone she hooked up with on vacation before we met, but she said he‚Äôd reached out because he became homeless and needed help setting up a LinkedIn.

After that, I became extremely distrustful. I started asking for proof of her whereabouts, which she found hurtful, and we ended up breaking up.

1goeq72,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1goeq72/the_seventh_mcdonalds_vhs_tape/,The Seventh McDonald‚Äôs VHS tape,"When you think of McDonald‚Äôs, chances are that you have fond memories. Whether it be the old commercials with Ronald, Grimace and all their friends, or immersing yourself in childhood whimsy at the small themed playgrounds outside your local McDonald‚Äôs, many associate McDonald‚Äôs with fun. 

Yeah, that‚Äôs what I originally thought too. 

The year was 2005. I had just come back from working my shift at the police station. Nothing overly eventful had happened, save for the occasional cat stuck in a tree or whatever. Nothing much really even happened in my town at all. Apart from one random missing children incident years before. I say children, but that‚Äôs relative. They were in their early adulthood and I was in my mid 40s. But that ended up being a cold case. Although, we would talk about it from time to time at the precinct

Back when I was starting out, I had received a case that five children in different neighborhoods had gone missing without any sign of leaving or a struggle. The thing they had in common was that all of them had a VHS playing in the TV at the time. However, unfortunately, the tapes were mysteriously blank when submitted into evidence. So all we could do was just chalk it up to coincidence.
I remember that day, I had a small bit of time to kill acter. And that‚Äôs when I remembered it was a yearly yard sale nearby. There was a family on the next block over from me that did this on the exact same day every year. After a few minutes of perusing and checking out what was available, my eyes landed on one particular VHS tape. In thick, squiggly letters I read: ‚ÄúTHE WACKY ADVENTURES OF RONALD MCDONALD: WEEKEND AT RONALD‚ÄôS!‚Äù.  

I hadn‚Äôt heard of this VHS tape before. I thought it was  rare. So naturally, I was practically ecstatic about the find. I was grabbing at my wallet to snap it up within seconds. 

From what I could understand, there had been seven of these tapes in total. All centred around the titular Ronald McDonald and all his friends in McDonaldland. The group consisted of Ronald, Birdie the Early Bird, Grimace, Sundae the dog, the hamburglar, and two kids called Tika and Franklin. 

‚ÄúTake it. It‚Äôs free‚Äù

I jolted back as an old woman appeared from seemingly nowhere behind the other side of the table.The video seemed like it might be a fun, lighthearted watch while drunk. Why not spend 40 or so minutes watching whimsical, brainless content?

‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll take it.‚Äù I responded.

I reach out to take it and she quickly grabs my wrist. Near bone breaking for an old woman. 

‚ÄúOh, but, when you see it, it sees you...‚Äù

I looked at her and felt like there was nothing behind her eyes. Maybe alzheimers or something. Honestly, this strange encounter made me want to watch the tape even more.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Once I reached home, I got out the VCR, which, I‚Äôll admit, hadn‚Äôt been touched in some time. 

The tape began with nothing really interesting happening in the live action segments. Just regular, kids show stuff. Ronald McDonald goofing off and the like. However, the animated segment is where things got just a little more interesting.

Ronald and the gang had been invited to a Halloween party in a mansion and just had to get there. But the thing was, the mansion was so big they didn‚Äôt know which room the party was being held in. Poor Birdie had become so terrified they wouldn‚Äôt make it that she popped out three eggs, all of which came out with screaming, pulsating baby birds.

It was just the kind of weird stuff I was looking for . I was having a bit of fun with the musical numbers, even. 

That all changed about 10 minutes in though. Members of the gang had started going missing one by one, and only Ronald was left standing. As Ronald creaked his way down the crumbling stairs, with his eyes being the only indicator of him moving, he flicked on the light, and let out a scream which sounded like it came from wild animal.

I felt nauseous. What had they done to these kids?

Theaudio and video started breaking up, but one thing was crystal clear. The gang. Theyjust stood there, smiling at the viewer. Somehow seeming to smile at me.

And then Ronald began edging closer and closer until I could see his seemingly mascara ridden eyes boring into mine. A distorted voice said:

knocked on the door a few days later and we had a nice chat. He seemed really nice and I invited him for coffee but he said he had to collect someone but would call another time. 

He is good looking and I know he is single as he uses dating apps. We have similiar hobbies and backgrounds. I have developed a massive crush on him and from my side would very much like to see if there could be any potential. He regularly appears on them and then seems to delete them again after a short space of time. I have once swiped right on him as I wanted to make a move (id prefer it to happen naturally when he is next door) but while it didn't come up as a match, this was after months of seeing him on there so he could have previously swiped on me and we wouldn't have matched then either as he has regularly deleted and reset. 

People that know him have described him to me as shy and unassuming so I don't know if he is shy with women but assuming so. He is known to be a really nice decent person.

I rarely see him as he seems to leave later or earlier than me in the mornings and comes home at different times. So it's hard to accidently on purpose bump into him. When I pass him in the car he always waves.

He had someone in painting his garden fence a few months ago and that gave me the idea about a month later I should do mine so I did. Then he put a prompt on a dating app that he is looking for someone who likes painting garden fences. Co incidence or just referring to himself? 

So the other night I needed help moving furniture upstairs and I asked him (even though it was like 10pm at night). I asked him if he would mind and he was really nice about it. It literally took two minutes what I needed him to help move and he said ask him for help anytime that he doesn't mind. I asked him if he wanted a coffee and he said he was fine (idk if asking was good as it was kind of late).

I'm just wondering if he was interested he knows I'm single. Would he have made a move by now? Do you think I should give up? I'm quite shy too..

1goeef0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1goeef0/feeling_stuck_thinking_of_taking_a_big_chance/,"Feeling stuck, thinking of taking a big chance - good idea?
","TLDR: I am stuck but more importantly miserable and unfulfilled at my (first) junior web development job. I could pursue another job but have realized I don't want to work on a computer for the rest of my life. Thinking of pursuing a very risky business idea like a coffee shop instead. It sounds cliche but I believe I have the combination of skills and experience to make a shop that stands out and does well. I am open to the relentless work in may involve as I believe it would be more fulfilling. Logically I see this isn't the smartest idea but, I am wondering if logic is always the best decision-maker. 

Some background: I have a degree in hr management. Never was a high performer in school because I have a chronic pain condition. Some days I just can't focus, particularly when it comes to blue collar work. Ironically, I can deal with my condition much more efficiently when it comes to work that involves moving around and being on my feet. It's been much more manageable in recent years due to diet and exercise, which makes that point even more true.

Undergrad took me forever to complete. I didn't go the standard 4-5 years, internship(s), then job. I got my degree after 8 years (dropped out for 2). Spent those two years working full time in the restaurant industry and continued doing so during the second stint of school.

Right around covid time I got a low paying remote office admin job. Eventually learned some coding and got a junior web development job. This was my first full salary job, and some of my skills apply perfectly to it, so I loved it at first. But 2.5 years later, I realize I'm stuck and unhappy.

Stuck because the company doesn't seem to have plans to progress my role. But more importantly, I realize that working from home, specifically as a web developer and with the isolation that comes along with it, isn't the best for me. I also don't have the drive to learn more code and up-skill in my free time, which is necessary to progress in this field.

I have of course considered that maybe I just need a new job, particularly one thats in person or at least hybrid. But the thing is, I grew up an anti social kid. I didn't have many friends and reluctantly spent most of my time in my room, on my computer. The thought of continuing to do that for the rest of my life is extremely unfulfilling and depressing.

I crave more human interaction, more connection, more stimulation. My gf is a teacher, and while she works too much, I envy the fulfillment and purpose she gets from what she does.

I have a couple of friends that are open to a general idea of 'starting a business'. I want to jump on this. A strong thought is a coffee shop. But that market is quite saturated, and has a statistical high chance of failure. However, I am kind of in a position where I feel like even the challenge and adventure of trying would be something worthwhile, even if it fails. I can then try something else.

I've never started a business and I know it isn't so simple. I recognize that it will be very hard work, likely 7 days a week for at least a year and maybe even multiple years before I can take a step back. But again, I'm thinking the fulfillment that I'd get if the business is successful, plus potentially building or becoming part of a community would make it worthwhile.

For what its worth, I am passionate about coffee and food. Don't want to sound cliche, but I do genuinely believe I have a combination of skills that would lead to a particularly unique and appealing coffee shop if I can find the right location. 90% of shops I see in my area all do the same boring generic designs and still do well. It often seems like location is all that matters.

I (20NB), started learning piano this year. It's been a dream of mine since middleschool, but I couldn't afford it back then, and now that I'm in uni and have a part time job, I can afford to put some money aside and learn how to play. I started mid september, and I honestly love it!

The thing is, I really do get along with my piano teacher ; he has kinda the same vibe as I do, he often jokes with me, and usually we spend a piece of each lesson just talking about whatever, and I truly get the vibe that he enjoys my company (I always arrive a little bit early, so I catch the end of the lesson of the person before me and he doesn't act as casual as he does with me). I knew he's roughly the same age as me, but just to be sure I googled his name and found a concert he did with his musical school, which showed me that in september of this year he was 19, so he's either turning 20 by the end of this year or next year, meaning we're very close in age.

I planned on asking him to grab a coffee to spend a little bit of time outside of lessons next week, just to hang out as friends, but right now I'm having some second thoughts and doubts ; even though we're very close in age, is it appropriate for me to ask out my teacher ? I try to say to myself that I do not get any grades from him and that piano is nothing but a hobby anyway, so it's not like I was asking out one of my uni teachers, but still, I wonder if I'm not about to cross a boundary and do something inappropriate. Also I'm worried that I just missinterpreted and gaslit myself into believing that he enjoys my company when in reality he's just acting polite, and I'm scared that if I ask him out and he declines there'll be an awkward vibe between us in the following lessons.

I really do not want to do anything inappropriate or out of touch, and maybe I'm overthinking this situation a lot, but I'd rather be safe than sorry and ask unbiased people for some advice.

tldr : I (20NB) wanna ask my piano teacher (19M) out for coffee because I enjoy his company and feel like he does too, but am afraid that it would be inappropriate since he's my teacher .",0,1731281947.0,relationship_advice,7,0.4,False

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôll get straight to the point.


I hope this helps someone, i don‚Äôt usually post that is why i decided to post. 

In may i had a severe yeast infection, i moved abroad and was under a lot of stress, my diet changed and i ate a lot of sugary foods and very few homecooked meals, I am a 33F and it was a first in my life, i did not know what it was and couldn‚Äôt go to a doctor because it was just before my period and it was gone right after my period. Fast forward for the last 3-4 months it was recurrent and i still couldn‚Äôt go to a doctor but was sure it was a YI

At first i used nothing waited for it to pass without changing anything in my life, then i started garlic supplements, it had caused a severe diaper/pad rash during my last period and burned my skin, 

Then i started using a probiotic for women containing only lactobacillus ramhnosus and reuteri (sorry for the typo) for the last 20 days before i found my cure
 
Here is what i did;

I took showers everyday with dove soap
Nothing (no suppositories mo boric acid no tampons (never used anyways))went in or up the vagina
I used only sudocrem for the itch and the burning for the severe burn from the rash-applied a thick layer even with the pad (it was a godsent relief)
ƒ∞ continued to use the probiotic (not even a full 30 capsules lost a few while opening the container)
After my period ended there it was again, i was crying myself to sleep everynight and panicking THEN i remembered blackseed oil (nigella sativa oil)- it a big thing where i grew up and is believed it is the cure for everything except death, we used it in food a lot for taste but you have to crush it atleast for it to be effective for sickness etc. Anyways, i started taking it (pregnant, breastfeeding women, people with high prolactin hormones, people used some type of immunosuppressant drugs should not used it please do your research and ask your doctor) i started taking it and fixed my diet, it also curbs your appettite so there will be little to no cravings for sugar, 

i took 1 teaspoon of nigella sativa black seed oil (reddish color smells like turpentine and a bit spicy taste, because of the thymoquinone, it has to have it) on empty stomach in the morning and before bed, it a strong antifungal and antibiotic (there are researches on c glabrata too, hiv, stds, look them up) i started taking it after my period fully ended

switched to not a strict candida diet but a balanced high protein homecooked meals, the nigella sativa oil also minimizes the die off effects imo. 

bread and sugar amounts are none to minimised (ate carrots or dates no processed sugar like coke zero or donuts) 

Sprayed my underwear with a mix of cleaning vinegar and water before wash and changed everyday (i am using a washer that is located on my floor with other people so that was the best i could do) and used the dryer on high heat, i do not have an iron so that was it

I had to heal my gut (it all starts from there, thats why nothing went in or up the vagina, only sudocrem covering the inside parts where the rash was)

Also i believe stress and spiritual reasons plays a big role, the root cause even on some sicknesses too, i remember i was having intimacy issues (ido not have a partner not even before this started) and also trust issues too so when i became aware of it i took away its power

You have to belittle it (your body is strong and has the ability to heal itself, remind yourself this everyday, it is just a YI, an unwanted company, that‚Äôll leave soon - i‚Äôve healed myself from a lot of things like this AND I KNOW it can be hard with the burning itching no sex drive the stress, remind yourself the power you have please i beg you)

When my brain went crazy, spiralling and bullying me i told it to please focus on curing this and healing me

I talked to my gut when i ate please take the necessary things and get rid of the others

I also talked to my vagina like remember you are strong and can get rid of this

I talked to the YI told it that i appreciate it and we can‚Äôt be together anymore

The talking happened mostly when i went to the bathroom or before bed etc.

When i started taking the nigellla sativa oil there was 5 left of the probiotics 

I continued to do this for 3-4 days
By the 3rd day there was nothing left, i stopped the oil because it almost started my period again(after 5 days it had ended) my tongue was still a bit white, but now 7-8 days layer it is gone, it was the really high amount of sugar and eating out was the most possible cause, never in my life i put sugar in my coffee or ate muffins for breakfast, now i understand why this started in the first place, stress etc. Reverse engineer it.

ƒ∞ am not on a strict diet for the candida or anything other to put my body and mind on a much bigger stress, a balanced diet is enough

Again this is my story, please do your own research and listen to your body!


I still splash a small amount of claning vinegar to the washer

I did not use acv, boric acid, creams other than sudocrem and any medications, i always take vitamin c in the mornings continued to take it.

There was an option before the black seed oil, if you cannot take it, i could not do it because i have a roommate, sitting bath with calendula (a handful calendula dried flowers boil it for 5 min, get a plastic tub you can sit in, does not have to be big and should be easy yo clean, fill it with a generous amount of water 3-6 litres that you can sit while the flowers are boiling, when the 5 mins are up clear the flowers and mix the ‚Äútea‚Äù with the water in the tub, it can be warm but not hot, sit in it for 15 mins everyother day, you have to change the water everytime and do the mixture again. (Please ask your doctor for this too, if you are pregnant etc.) 

- there are some women who injected the oil to their vaginas, i do not recommend it. First it may burn reallybad, 2 there is no trials on how long or how often that it has to be done, you cannot see the insides and can cause a bad reaction. 

-i was looking for a cure and not a suppository that i should everytime after periods/sex/dietary change etc. I refuse to live like that on the edge with the fear.

* i usually do not even take painkillers, i am not antivaccine or doctors, i listen to my body and i also believe the power of my mind and body. Also i believe taking more drugs causes resistance in a lot of health issues. Please do your own research. + dr. joe dispenza meditations can be a help, there are a lot of testimonials (not on candida but healing)

** i did not even know what type of candida it was, when i researched it sent me to a bitch of a spiral, still do not know what type of candida it is.

Her dog is constantly pooping in the kids bathroom. Spilling coffee and other stuff on the carpet and leaving it for hours before she cleans it. She's also throwing fits and acting like a child when things don't go her way. She will leave and stay at her friends house when she's mad at us and then come back and give us the silent treatment.

I am also looking at upgarding my GPU to a 4070 Super. From what I can tell the ASUS NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER DUAL EVO OC 12GB (https://www.asus.com/uk/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/dual/dual-rtx4070s-o12g-evo/) seems to be the best option out of the lot, but feel free to give advice as I understand some say the MSI version is better. Either way am I right in thinking that I will also need to upgrade my power supply?

  
Sorry for the excessive questions, I appreciate any advice, suggestions or insight!

TLDR at the bottom.

I‚Äôm a college student, and last year I did an internship for the summer. There were a few dozen summer interns, and we all got to know each other. There was one intern in particular who was very attractive, but at the time I didn‚Äôt think he was gay, so I didn‚Äôt pay him much attention beyond being friendly and chatty at lunch, just like all other interns. 

Fast forward to 3-4 months ago and I come across his Instagram, with a rainbow flag in his bio. I add him and we start chatting and catch up on what we‚Äôve been doing since that internship last year etc. 

I kept in touch with two other interns in particular, and we make an effort to meet up for lunch/coffee on occasion. So I invite him along to the next meet up, which was around when college started this semester. He was just as attractive as I remembered him, and now that I had seen the Instagram bio, I wanted to get to know him a bit better and then after a while, ask him out. 

So I met up with him again 3 more times, once with other interns, twice just him and me. He was so nice to chat to, and more or less exactly my type, so I knew I wanted to ask him out. I texted him last week asking to see him for just 5 minutes as I ‚Äúwanted to ask him something‚Äù. We met on campus and I asked if he was single. He said that he wasn‚Äôt, and I explained that I was going to ask him out on a date. 

He said something along the lines of ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs my loss, I‚Äôm flattered‚Äù. I said it was fine, and asked if we could still be friends. He insisted that we go for a coffee and chat, which we did. Later on I apologised if I had made him feel awkward earlier, to which he said I hadn‚Äôt. He was very flattered, said I was very attractive, and that I could do better than him (I can‚Äôt, I was reaching for the starts looks-wise here, but it was nice to hear it anyway). 

I then asked him how long he‚Äôd been seeing his current partner. He said for about six months. He explained that he keeps quiet about it due to the nature of said partner‚Äôs work. The guy I asked out does some volunteer work at the company, and that‚Äôs how they met. Basically, relationships are discouraged by the company, which I understand given the nature of the work. I thanked him for the explanation and we parted ways. 

We‚Äôve spoken a small bit since then, but not much. To be honest, I am miserable because of it. I genuinely had no idea he was seeing someone, and I‚Äôd worked myself up into thinking I had a chance when in reality I had none. It was devastating to be honest, especially since I found him very attractive, and that we got on so well (similar interests, humour, etc.)

I do not resent him at all, this is all internal. He took it so well, and was very kind in his rejection. If I was to be told no, that was probably the nicest way he could have done it. I‚Äôm just still upset by it all. I‚Äôve dated all the way through college, but no man has ever made me catch feelings like he has, so it‚Äôs tough to adjust to. I‚Äôd like to remain friends with him, but would that cause me more hurt?

I know I‚Äôm overthinking, but I just need to vent to people who will understand what it‚Äôs like. The gay dating pool is already small in my city as it is, and it‚Äôs basically impossible at my age to get a date without it being through Tinder, Hinge and so on. 

Any words of encouragement from this fantastic community would be appreciated greatly, this place has been a great comfort for me during the years when I was coming to terms with my sexuality ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

TLDR: guy I knew from a past job came back into my life and I caught feelings. After re-connecting and seeing him a few times, I decide to ask him out. Unfortunately he‚Äôs seeing someone, and I can‚Äôt really get over it. He is very attractive and is my type. It‚Äôs hard to shake the hurt. ",5,1731281523.0,gaybros,4,0.78,False

I need to vent,"Like the title says, I (24f) got my bf (26m) the ps5 pro. I ordered it the morning after it released while I was at work, and I am so excited I can barely keep it in. So, if you wouldn‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôm just gonna get everything off my chest so I‚Äôm not a loser who spoils such an amazing surprise. 

I‚Äôm giving it to him as an early Christmas gift because we recently talked about selling his first edition PS5 that he got back in 2020, and I thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to sell it before the holidays. 

He has NO idea that I even know it‚Äôs been released, so it‚Äôs going to be a SUPER big surprise. He‚Äôs only brought up the Pro once, which was when he said he wants to trade in his old one for the pro after the holidays.

The day that I ordered it, I told him that I ordered a Xmas present and it‚Äôll be delivered soon, and asked if he‚Äôs okay with getting it early since it‚Äôs a little bulky and hard to hide in our apartment. I then said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt get your hopes up, it‚Äôs just something small, but it makes more sense to give it to you before Xmas so I don‚Äôt have to try to hide it for damn near 2 months.‚Äù I also worded some other things in a way where he thinks it‚Äôs a Christmas decoration of some sort LMAO. He said he doesn‚Äôt mind getting it early, and that he doesn‚Äôt care how big or small it is, it‚Äôs the thought that counts. He then said ‚Äúyou got me a gaming chair for my birthday last year, what more could I need? That‚Äôs the best gift I‚Äôve ever gotten‚Äù. That made me so much more excited for this gift, you have no idea. 

It arrives this week, but he has off work from Sunday-Tuesday. I want to wait until his weekend rolls around to give it to him so he has 3 days to play with it, even though I‚Äôm dying to give it to him immediately. 

My plan is to ask him on Saturday while he‚Äôs at work if we could have a movie night. It‚Äôs a semi-common thing for us to ask the other ahead of time since 80% of our nights consist of us both playing video games until we go to bed (I‚Äôm PC). I have off Saturday so I‚Äôm going to grab the package at my friends (where it‚Äôs being delivered), and then wrap it and have the present on our coffee table when he gets home. I‚Äôll be like ‚Äúhey! The present I told you about last week finally arrived! Wanna open it before we start the movie?‚Äù And then when he opens it, I‚Äôll be like ‚Äújust kidding, there is no movie night. Let‚Äôs set this bad boy up!‚Äù

I‚Äôm SOOO excited to give it to him. He has done so much for me these past few years as I struggled with a lot of health issues and struggled working more than 20 hours a week due to those health issues. But now that I‚Äôm healthier and able to work full time again, and we aren‚Äôt living paycheck to paycheck anymore, I finally have the opportunity to give him a good gift that he has deserved for years. 

I just needed to get this off my chest somewhere so I don‚Äôt tell him before it even arrives. It‚Äôs tearing me APART!!! ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ okay THANK YOU I love y‚Äôall and I hope you all are doing well ü´∂üèº",53,1731281402.0,PS5pro,17,0.97,False

I have this odd dermatitis when I drink coffee. My face skin (only face and no where else) becomes scaly, thicker, and builds up something like a woman building up their endometrium before menstruation. And then when I stop drinking coffee, from that moment to the next week or 2 weeks, my face gets itchy, red, also causes very severe seborrhis dermatitis (on scalp), (and the skin peels off and resets back to nice skin....at least until then next time I drink coffee.

The reaction is MUCH MUCH stronger than other coffees I drink. I imagine, that the caffeine content is nearly the same. With some of these coffees, a few sips (where caffeine is negligible) this weird dermatitis occurs rapidly.

ddx: coffee allergy, histamine, caffeine allergy, mold allergy, allergic to something else unknown within coffee.

I think this isn't caffeine allergy. Mold is a new fad so idk- maybe.  
Histamine idk: Taking benadryl or benadryl cream does not improve the condition.

Ironically, I'm a med student, and yet throughout my studies I couldn't figure out this damned problem. And due to the insane amount of studying, I can't just stop drinking coffee. So my skin ends up extremely nasty every exam cycle like a reptile that builds and sheds it skin. I fking hate this.

Tea doesn't work for me. The L-Theanine in tea cancels out my desired effects of the caffeine.

Anyways, I'm just going testing each ddx one by one. I've eliminated caffeine as the cause. Caffeine pills do not cause the problem (but caffeine pills doesn't seem to have the same effect as coffee on me), so I suspect coffee has other active ingredients besides caffeine. 

I bought Purity coffee pods to be shipped soon, so I could see if it's the mold (assuming their quality control is true).",1,1731281252.0,espresso,2,0.67,False

**Description:**

*Butcher & Blackbird* meets *Black Mirror*

Expedition Captain Finn Foley loves to kill, and there's nothing he can do about it‚Äîtrust him, he's tried. But he isn't going to let that stop him from becoming the fearless leader he's always wanted to be. When he's selected to head a six-month Arctic research mission, he needs an easy victim to feed his addiction. Antisocial botanist Ruby Davies is just the girl he's been looking for.

Ruby's new job at the world's leading biotech company is perfect. Except for the cultishness, the coffee, and the overly cocky captain who keeps trying to recruit her for his latest mission. But when her research comes under threat, she decides to pack it up and continue her work in secret. In the Arctic.

After a navigational mistake strands them at the wrong research base, the crew is forced to survive at a long-abandoned outpost that's far from the high-tech, pre-stocked facility they were prepared for. With only a week‚Äôs worth of rations and no hope of rescue, Finn is overthrown, and the new captain is out for blood‚Äîwith the connectionless Ruby in his sights.

Both on the outs, Ruby and Finn team up, pulling Ruby out of her hard-earned shell and forcing Finn to reconsider his plans. Now, Ruby must connect with her peers before her unpopularity kills her, and Finn must find a way to keep Ruby safe from unstable crewmates, polar bears, and most of all, himself.

Today, someone comes up to you and says, ""This needs to stop.""","(Thank you to u/AphelionRedux for the [Original Prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1gmv9qs/wp_you_are_in_a_time_loop_that_you_intentionally/))



""It was actually partially an accident, an experiment gone rogue. I'm studying physics at the Kitchener University you see, writing my thesis in quantum tunnelling photons. I've been working on with bending light back on itself to create a sort of loop that could, theoretically, slow down light, which would prove that universal laws aren't..""

""I don't care how you're doing it."" Kutchner interrupted Laurens speech, his breath heaving between utterances. ""I just want you to stop.""

Lauren stared at him. He was an older man, probably in his 50's, hunched over the diner table, curling and uncurling his fist in a repetitive stupor. Despite the cold weather his forehead was covered in sweat, except for one spot just under his hairline that was marked by a long surgical scar. The harsh light of the empty establishment they were in only exacerbated his crooked visage.

""I'm not going to stop it, not while I have work to do"" Lauren said. She knew she had found the breakthrough of the century, if not the millennia. Possibly for all of human history.

""How did you find me anyway?""

""You really won't listen until you get an explanation, huh? Alright. You were the only thing that changed."" Kutchner looked up at her. The rhythmic dripping of a coffee machine punctuated his moment of thought. ""It took me a long time. Well, I guess you'd know. I was looking for anything to explain what was going on. After I had accepted it was even happening that is. I started finding small things. The word choice of a passer-by. A phone call slightly delayed. It wasn't easy, trying to remember every little thing. Human memory is awful slippery it seems, especially when you're in pain. But I looked. Looked and remembered. Traffic was useful. I watched traffic broadcasts from the whole state. Studied the highways. A single car going on or off the highway can cause a whole mess of delays.""

""The butterfly effect"" Lauren blurted out ""It's a part of chaos theory. In systems with..""

Kutchner held up a hand and ¬¥sent her an unambivalent look. She was still shocked by his sudden appearance on her otherwise undisturbed nightly walk. She'd made it a habit of rounding out her day with a milkshake at Pat's Diner, on account of it being empty with the exception of the half deaf owner. Any conversations she could have with the rest of the world seemed trivialised at this point. And she had had most of them already. Now she felt somewhat out of practice, faced with a stranger who was somehow in the same position as her.

After a strained pause Kutchner continued.

""I followed the changes. I knew I was heading the right way when they became more apparent. Eventually they led me to this town, and to the university. And to you, two days ago. Or two loops or repetitions or whatever they are. I knew as soon as soon as I saw you that you were free of them like I was. You look at everything like you aren't quite part of it, aren't responsible for what your actions lead to. Don't frown at that, it's OK, I probably do the same. I eventually found you going here and managed to arrive before you. I takes me a long time to get here though."" Kutchner glanced at his watch.

""Twenty past midnight. Soon I'll wake up again, and I'll have to drive all the way from New York Mercy. So please. Stop whatever thing you built.""

As jarring as him appearing had been, Lauren was equally fascinated.  She had not expected anyone else to have been affected by it though, and especially not someone who hadn't even been in the vicinity of the experiment. She was bursting with questions, but could feel that Kutchner wasn't exactly in the mood.

""I'm not stopping it until I know how it works. I've figured out most of the physics behind it.""

""You shouldn't have started it at all. And if you can stop it, you should"" Kutchner grunted.

""Think about what it can be used for though. We can create ground breaking technology without the cost of time. And you being here proves that we can. Appoint a group to fix a problem, set them in a time loop where they don't age, but their ideas mature. We can solve global warming and the energy crisis. Every day I keep this loop going I'm stopping a death that would happen tomorrow.""

""And everyday you cause the same people to die over and over again. To be in pain over and over again. For every person living their happiest day, someone is living their worst. It's natural for time to make both of those pass. You're playing god."" He paused to catch his breath. Lauren knew what he meant, but knew he didn't understand the full picture. He didn't see the possibilities she did.

""There's a crash on the I-78 right now. "" He continued. ""The same five cars, everyday, thirteen people reliving that fear, that pain. Even more getting phone calls, informing them, listening in disbelief as they lose a family member.""

""They won't even remember"" Lauren tried.

""It doesn't matter if they remember, cause it's happening right now. And me. I'm in pain, and I remember. I'm in chronic pain. I'm scheduled for surgery. I flew out here for it. It was supposed to be in three days. I've been waiting years."" Kutchners voice cracked.

""I haven't seen my family in I don't know how long. I haven't kissed my wife. My brain is filled with traffic information. And I'm in god damn pain. So why can't you just stop it.""

Lauren hesitated.

""There was a set of very specific circumstances around the experiment. I have been able to figure out how it loops time once it's started, but not how it started at all. I'm working on a theory, but I need exact data of what is going on. If I turn it off before then, I'll never be able to turn it on again. This thing could transform humanity, and this is our only shot at it."" Lauren tensed up as she was talking. She could see Kutchner's fading hope on his face.

""How much time"" Kutchner choked down a wave of pain.

Lauren felt her heart sinking in her chest.

""You can't stop yourself can you?"" Kutchner continued ""When was the last time you saw you parents? The last time you went out with your friends? None of it matters without time passing, does it? You can always get around to it, so you never do. And this thing, your one chance to figure it out. You just can't stop yourself from working on it, can you? How much longer will it take?""

Tears welled up in Laurens eyes. She became aware of a a pressing sensation on her chest. Aware that it had been with her for a long time, but that she had failed to notice it.

""At least another decade.. if it's even possible""

Her tears continued as she found herself in bed, staring up at the ceiling. For the first time in a long time, she desperately missed her mom.

She didn't go to the lab that day. Instead she wandered around aimlessly, looking at the town moving in a clockwork motion she knew like the back of her hand. Every movement of the world was a choreographed dance. People moving around the park with the same clothes, the same route, the same mood as always. A car running a red light, swerving around a bicyclist who unfurled a slew of profanity. She mouthed the words along with him. She really had been here a long time.

How long she couldn't say. Had she kept count at one point? She felt as if outside her body, looking in and not understanding how she had gotten here. That damn guy was right.

As Kutchner pulled up to Pat's Diner, Lauren was waiting outside.

""Beat you here"" She opened the passengers door and handed him a milkshake. She could feel her body resisting while her mind was longing for it to be over. ""The uni is just up the road from here.""

Kutchner looked at her as a smile cut across his otherwise pained expression.

The Buzz on the Spin

‚ÄúSir, the friends we didn‚Äôt make the acquaintance of on our second to last world are here.‚Äù Harold whispers to Observer Wu‚Äôs eyes widen.

‚ÄúAre you certain?‚Äù

‚ÄúA relative of mine on this station is a far better hunter and tracker than I, she described them. From her tone, this is the first time she‚Äôs seen them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been followed...‚Äù Observer Wu says.

‚ÄúWhich leads to several questions...‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich I want answers to. Use a light touch and get them.‚Äù He orders and Harold nods.

‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù Harold says standing back.

‚ÄúGood man.‚Äù

‚ÄúIncidentally, I have a relative on station. Yzma, she‚Äôs in Sector Seven, rules it from my Understanding. She‚Äôs an in-law from my baseline brother and has adopted one of my clone siblings. I think she has another human blooded child too. She also helped me shortly after I came out of the cloning tube, I owe her at the very least a visit.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did she help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe got me through the sheer mental what the fuckery of knowing I‚Äôm a clone with the original‚Äôs memories but distinctly NOT the original. It‚Äôs... not easy knowing that you were made to be a thing and not a person. She got my head on straight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were cloned young man? Why?‚Äù Janet asks gently.

‚ÄúTesting. They wanted to see what chemicals and what concentrations of those chemicals would harm a human.‚Äù Harold says and Janet looks horrified. Then gives him a hug.

‚ÄúYou poor thing. Are you even a full year old yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh you poor little lamb. So young and life has clearly been so hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúUhh... thank you but I‚Äôm fine?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no young man, there‚Äôs no being fine with such a thing. Not so soon. Such things take time to heal from and you‚Äôre simply not old enough to have lived so long.‚Äù

‚ÄúI promise you, I‚Äôm over it. I spoke to and came to peace with my original and am now building a life beyond him. That‚Äôs part of what this trip is about. Not only am I an insider Observer Wu can question at will, not only can I serve to help defend The Inevitable, but it‚Äôs taking me from place to place and do something that I as Herbert always wanted to do, which is go from world to world. He‚Äôs too tied down in his duties on Centris for more than the occasional Vacation. He‚Äôs never been here, but he wants to take a look. I get to do that instead.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to hear it young man. Now, before you go, I‚Äôm going to make you something, so find a seat and relax. You‚Äôre going to be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam thank you but...‚Äù Harold begins to say and she bustles him onto a padded stool.

‚ÄúOh no no, little children get free treats from me and a man less than a year old needs them. Wait right there.‚Äù

Observer Wu is taking notes with a very amused look on his face

‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

‚ÄúFuck you! This place is supposed to be where strength and guts matter! Not where stupid rich twits get pandered to by gutless station staff.‚Äù

‚ÄúBig words from the Bimbo I beat like a drum.‚Äù Hoagie replies as he drags the idiot into a holding cell.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt keep me in here! You‚Äôve got rules! Rules that you follow! Rules I know you can‚Äôt break without breaking the agreements and draw of this station!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt get it do you? The only real rule of this station is that this station follows only it‚Äôs own rules. Little miss heiress is here to buy illegal drinks at a massive markup, get ploughed in ways that she‚Äôd get in all the trouble back home for if she tried and watch some brutal fights, pissing money the whole time and leaving a trail of wealth behind her until she tires of being little miss naughty and goes home. Hell if she starts to feel bad about it then she can go to sector eight, cry in a confessional and then go home feeling both sullied and cleansed. That‚Äôs the way she and her little social group of overly rich idiots have done this for the past century and if you think that we‚Äôre going to let some opportunistic, short sighted little bitch get in the way of all that money, then you‚Äôve got another thing coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI...‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is ending one of two ways. You and your posse swear to stay away from our mutual moneybag of a friend. You don‚Äôt get in anymore trouble and she goes home with stories of adventure which lure in more of them. You don‚Äôt get in trouble and we don‚Äôt throw you out for shitting where we eat. OR, you do something stupid and we do something sadistic. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a hard choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot much of a choice at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not. But this is the choice on a station like this. You avoid giving us hell and we let you stay. If you can‚Äôt stop yourself then you go out the airlocks and we scrap your junker of a ship.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey! The Bloody Beak is a top of the line...‚Äù

‚ÄúMound of scrap and junk if you keep pushing us.‚Äù Hoagie says withdrawing his laser cutter and extending it, the telescoping pole begins glowing on one side to reveal it as the powerful but crude cutting implement rated for ship hulls. The safeties normally found on such devices are noticeably absent. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll personally hack it to pieces with this. Now I do get it, little miss oblivious is wearing more than some people see in years. But we‚Äôve been gently squeezing her dry so she can have her silly little adventure time after time.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs just...‚Äù

‚ÄúThe posh place exists for a reason. You want to take someone hostage or pull a stunt like that? Do it some place where the target‚Äôs big momma isn‚Äôt likely to send a literal fleet to get them back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? Big bad pirate station scared of what some big girl is gonna do?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of three things happen when you take a hostage. They pay the ransom, they ignore you, or they attack. Even if the odds are fair you only have a one in three chance of making money, but in all three situations Octarin Spin loses. But let‚Äôs put that aside. Let me ask you a more interesting question.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù She asks as he douses and retracts his cutting bar.

‚ÄúWhat do you do after? Say you get a solid billion in a payout. You‚Äôre still not out of the debris field sweetheart. You need to either collect the physical payment, or you need to let them know the number of an account to deposit it to. One they can monitor and use to track you. Now... what makes you think that the very rich person you just seriously pissed off ISN‚ÄôT going to take a large amount of cash possibly the very same cash in the account you just gave them access to in order to put a price on your head?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat... it... oh shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Hostage situations rarely end well and rarely end at all, not without bodies. So, calm the hell down, take a nap and then get yourselves some drinks in Sector Three when this cell opens in two hours. Okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo hours?!‚Äù

‚ÄúWoman you‚Äôre ageless! Two hours is barely enough time for a half decent nap!‚Äù He protests and she snarls at him. He reaches through the bars and flicks her nose. ‚ÄúCalm the fuck down before you get into a knife fight with a Snict or something. Pissy bitches don‚Äôt last long in places like this. Two hours is time enough for our money maker to move on and things to calm down. Stay out of Posh Place for a week and it‚Äôll be like nothing happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut...‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm setting a timer on your cells. Automatic release in two hours. If I run into you again and it‚Äôs not just a coincidence then I‚Äôm not going easy again. Get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut this is...‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm being nice here lady. I won‚Äôt be nice twice.‚Äù He says inputting the codes to get things down. ‚ÄúHopefully you won‚Äôt be seeing me again... and keep your stupid out of Sector Four, I know everything that happens there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a problem solver on this station. Remember that.‚Äù He tells them before leaving the holding cells and starting to head out.

‚ÄúHello farmer boy.‚Äù A Volpir woman immediately greets him the second he leaves. Her nose plugged with diamond studded stoppers so that she doesn‚Äôt get a whiff of his pheromones.

‚ÄúNot now.‚Äù He says walking past the woman, glittering gown and all. She starts and then starts following him.

‚ÄúWait we do need to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in the mood for one of your boss‚Äô games. If she wants to talk to me she has my communicator‚Äôs extension and can get a hold of me at any hour of the day. I‚Äôm not going to cool my heels in her waiting room when she can just talk to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe only wants to thank you for your help!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo she wants to try and style on me with gold and jewels while looking gracious at the same time and I‚Äôm not in the mood for such a thing. We have one of the two Cruel Space Capable Warships in the Galaxy in orbit around The Spin and official ambassadors and observers going around. I don‚Äôt have the time or inclination for stupid games I need to convince the army of super soldiers that this station packed to the gills with petty criminals of all stripes would NOT look better as burning wreckage.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt!‚Äù

‚ÄúNot unless someone convinces them to... but considering the stupidity I just put away, can you rule it out? Truly?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen if you‚Äôll excuse me, I need to get moving.‚Äù Hoagie says.

Eyes unseen make note of the entire interaction and he is followed out.

‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

‚ÄúI‚Äôm back, where‚Äôs scrawny Harold?‚Äù Hoagie asks as he arrives at his mother‚Äôs diner.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs off to speak with someone in Sector Seven, family apparently.‚ÄùObserver Wu says as he sips at his mug of coffee. Some would mock him for having so much cream and sugar in it. But he preferred his drinks something he could down quickly and full of energy to work with. The stereotype of police officers liking sweets more than is healthy has a damn good reason behind it. You need explosive energy to deal with the snap situations that they have to deal with.

‚ÄúYzma then. I‚Äôm half tempted to chase after him and see how that turns out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a huntress, that‚Äôs more than just chasing something down or lining up a sight with a rifle. She‚Äôs very, very skilled with traps and he‚Äôs likely hanging upside down by his ankle with a tether around it. Possibly dodging some equivalent to a banana cream pie being launched at him as he tries to untangle himself. She has a sense of humour.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must admit, if you did give into temptation to rush over I would follow.‚Äù Observer Wu says with a comfortable sigh. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve been having a lovely chat with your mother. Apparently you‚Äôre a combination of a police officer and a crime lord?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be honest sir.‚Äù Hoagie says as he walks over to sit opposite of him. ‚ÄúThe difference between a member of law enforcement and organized crime is often which side has the government backing them. And sometimes not even that separates them.‚Äù

‚ÄúTragically true. Corrupt officers can make it even more confusing.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. I‚Äôm the Sector Head, a semi-official position. Basically if the owner of the station wants something big to happen in this sector the job is delegated to me. In return I‚Äôm allowed to police and profit from this sector to a huge degree. My personal touch is to make sure that the people that want to be productive money makers and stable employment on the station have all the room and safety needed to do that without much in the way of limits. As such we‚Äôre up in food production and monetary gain. I also personally track down trouble makers and have become a well known problem solver the station over.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople fear the floral shirts.‚Äù He says with a straight face and his mother starts giggling to the side. Impressively the straight face remains.

There is an ominous buzzing outside. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs my break over. Someone has stirred up the Hive.‚Äù

He stands up and starts moving. ‚ÄúExcuse me.‚Äù

A few quick steps out of the diner and an undetectable presence dodges back as he breaks into a sprint and then dives off the plat form and heads down to the docking level to deal with whatever and whoever thought it was a good idea to stir up trouble in section four.

Observer Wu turns back from where he watched the man dive to what would be his doom on Earth and then regards the boy‚Äôs mother. ‚ÄúSo is effectively always in some kind of action movie now? Or is today exciting?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, baring your arrival it‚Äôs been rather slow.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? What would you call an exciting day then Miss Eastman?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I think a wonderful example would be how my first week here ended.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? Do go on. Please.‚Äù

1godqms,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1godqms/just_a_rant_hope_someone_can_understand/,"Just a Rant, Hope Someone Can Understand! :)","I feel like for the majority of my romantic life I have been a jack of all trades, but a master of none. I know so much, yet have done so little.

I'm 25M here. Making up for lost time. The cards I've been dealt have been less than stellar. Diagnosed with inherited depression at 23 (had it since 10, didn't know). Relationships have been hard for me because of it since that lil' voice tells you you're not, ""attractive enough"", ""experienced enough"" ""good enough"", ""smart enough"", ""gay enough"", ""straight enough"". Only recently through some treatment, I realize these are not true.

I'm a bisexual heteroromantic, with a huge lean in phys. attraction towards guys. Lovely...

The bi-cycle, holyyy moly... It's like sometimes I'll be swinging 80% hetero for a month, and then 100% homo for 6 months, or vice versa. I've been trying to put a label on this since I was 12.5! From 9-12 I was fully, genuinely straight. You can bet when 12.5 came around, that gay-switch confused me af. I never rlly acted on my bisexuality cause I didn't' want to ""lie"" to girls or ""come out"" so I could date guys. Didn't help that my type was straight guys for a long time...

Oh, and here's the best part, I've had internalized homo/biphobia the entire ride through. I was raised that gays were creepy/perverted/sinful/confused and bisexuals are just gays who can't admit they're gay. Also, it was programmed in that I was basically guaranteed an STD if I was with another guy. I'm not bashing religion, but I bash the hatefulness and rationality of biphobia that stemmed from it.

From 12.5-21, I thought I was fully gay. I ""came out"" at 19 to a few close HS/Uni friends but that was it. Not my family, they're hardcore religious, I don't need more self-hate or drama (I even live in a free country). Never acted on this because of the fear of being outed. I was even too scared to make a tinder cause of paranoia and fear that people would find/screenshot/out/make fun of me (depression is wicked). I honestly had no idea how to meet other guys either, even in my liberal leaning college. Since I was a twink I thought guys would just come up to me or something (ik, what was I thinking...? acc kinda funny xD) so I waited. 

At 22, my internalized homophobia kicked in hard and said, ""you're getting old to not have a GF or experience, start now"" *(no shame to people who don't have experience, I was just coping!)*, and somehow, it actually made me genuinely start finding **some** girls attractive. Nothing really came out of it at the time, I wasn't sure I could commit, so only some coffee dates came out of it. So I feel like I wasted time discovering that late. 

When I first kissed another guy at 23, I thought I was going to hell and not accepted into heaven. And yeah, it took me until 23 to finally kiss someone, period. I've only been in two relationships since then within the last 1.5 years: 1 with a girl for a few months, one LDR with a guy for a few months + fooled around with a few guys. Never felt comfortable in my own skin tho. My last GF felt like a very demisexual experience.

Until 23, I just used to cope with romantic loneliness/abstinence by making a lot of friends. It's not that I'm unattractive (I model), rude, or an incel, I was just really scared to be me and pushed girls and even some guys that liked me away, and never tried. It was rlly hard for me the other day because I was on the bus, and I was overhearing some teens congratulating their gay friend on a new bf. I just thought, I should've been doing that when I was that age. But alas, I was just more afraid of what other people would think then. And truly, comparison is the thief of joy.

So, where do I stand today, at 25? Well, I'm on the right track. I regularly date both men and women, I'm on the apps, and getting my depression sorted out, caring for my friends/family, setting up my career. I'm honest about my outness to guys I date: that until I prioritize dating them but unless I get into an LTR, I don't plan on saying much to my fam just yet... but I'm giving less and less f\*cks everyday which is nice (TY u depression treatment <3). Until I find therapy, I'm unpacking all of this internalized bullshit on my own. **But... I can't forgive myself for how much time I've wasted being in my own head.** Highschool, college... just gone. Youth, mostly robbed. I know this is just perspective, I know I'm still young at 25, but I won't lie and say it doesn't hurt that half my life has been tainted with internalized homophobia and depression. It's not like I don't have accomplishments, friends, and good things, I do. Just sad about this in particular I guess, because living with lots of regret is really hard.¬†

Today, I'm still confused about the future and what I want. A marriage? A wife? A husband? I think about marrying a guy and missing out on having my own biological children, but then I think about marrying a woman and having strong urges to be with a guy. It's tuff. The pressure of 30 creeping up freaks me out a bit 0\_0.

Sorry for the rambling, I appreciate it if you read this far :) It means a lot. I'm not a bitter person in general, it's just that this realization of wasted time is really hard! Anything word would be appreciated. Even if its a virtual kick in the ass for me to do something better about this! I'm all about improving and can now take criticism. Lots of love to this sub! Thank you.

**TLDR:** Depression and major internalized bi/homophobia caused me to be socially anxious and repressed from ages 12.5-22. Bi-cycle was prevalent and caused me to not pursue anything in case of misleading people. Slowly creeping out of closet since 19. I missed out on a lot of my youth romantically, and now I regret all of it at 25. Still a bit confused for the future, but getting a lot better and fixing the past mindsets. Advice is appreciated :) lots of love.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

Then that girl (23) which I had so much in common with that we both thought we were a prank, she arrived in my life at a time where I needed new things.

After a week of chatting we settled for a date, a 10 AM coffee. After 3 hours or so of chatting and discovering so many things we had in common, she asked ""What do we do now ?""

I never felt such a rapid change in how I view a situation. It wasn't another coffee that would lead to nothing. It was leading to something, I didn't know what, but it was. So I suggested we go to my place.

I never invite anyone, so it's rarely tidy, but that day it was. She sat on the couch, and I sat next to her. It's a sofa bed and one of the slats is missing so as we went on chatting, we were falling against one another until we were cuddling.

I assume we both knew where this was gonna lead, and out of nowhere I asked :

""Can I kiss you ?""

And she nodded yes, with her eyes closed and a small high-pitched ""hum"" of approval.

And we kissed.

I'm not a social person, nor a romantic or physical one. This story ended up being short and a bit painful for me. However it's the one thing I'm sure I'll never say I messed up. 

And as painful as it may have been, this happened the same day I decided to quit drinking, so after all maybe it's a pain for a heal.

I‚Äôm (F29) so sad. I‚Äôm not the perfect spouse or partner, I‚Äôve never claimed to be. But I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve been throwing myself at my wife (F30)  for months and months and we have had sex maybe twice. One of the times felt like pity sex. We haven‚Äôt had a super active sex life before then but for some reason it‚Äôs really starting to affect me now. 

We don‚Äôt have kids. We both work. We both take care of the home. We are intimate in other ways, but the second I reach for her and try to initiate something more she withdraws and says ‚Äúnot right now‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe later.‚Äù Then teases me for being ‚Äúalways in the mood‚Äù or ‚Äújust like a man‚Äù which is very unfair to both me and men. 

She sent me a text earlier from work asking me to take a shower with her. I had already showered and have mobility issues due to an injury so shower sex is stressful to me. I‚Äôd rather be in bed where we can focus on each other 100%, not possibly slipping and falling. I told her this and she acknowledged me. I started reading some sexy stories to get myself extra in the mood. I get extra groomed and ready before she comes home, and once she gets home there‚Äôs nothing. No mention of our discussion earlier , she wanted to sit and drink coffee instead of following me to bed. 

It hurt. I feel completely rejected. since then I have been withdrawn. I decided I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm not initiating. No bringing it up. If she wants me she can make it known to me. She knows I‚Äôm in a mood and I want space and in response has also withdrawn and is reacting with her own bad mood. I‚Äôve been in the office doing work for the past 3 hours. 

It‚Äôs not about the sex. I want to feel wanted. I want her to want to make love to me. I want her to have passion for me. I am young and attractive and healthy and each day that passes I will become less and less young and attractive. I don‚Äôt mean to be vain but I feel like I‚Äôm wasting the best days of my life. It‚Äôs not about the sex, it‚Äôs about the intimacy. I need physical sexual connection to feel her and us on that level and she just won‚Äôt meet me halfway. I think she has a lot of mental hang ups because of grief she has experienced in her life and it affects her ability to have sexual contact with me. I try to be there for her mentally and emotionally but she is a brick wall and won‚Äôt let me in. Then I feel like she gets even more upset when I match her energy and stop trying. I‚Äôm at a loss.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

The only working employees seemed to be a zoomer and her millennial manager. I wasn't paying much attention but the manager walked away on some errand and that left just the zoomer standing behind the island counter thing on her phone as I walked up to get a regular c up of coffee.

She didn't look up and actually crouched down a little more as I stood there. I said ""Hello?"" and tried to get her attention and stepped slightly to the side and noticed she slinked slowly to the opposite side trying to hide, staring at her phone the whole time. I continued to try to talk to her and she continued to ignore me and tried to keep leaning more out of sight. After a couple minutes it became clear this person was not going to do ANY work without her manager here and it was just pointless to even try. It was like she really thought I couldn't see her even though she's like behind translucent containers. I assume if she was on break she wouldn't be hanging out behind the counter, maybe put up a sign out something? Seems weird to take a break when you're there only employee at the moment and the store is open.

I've had pointless zoomer aggression at being expected to work and such too, but that really took the cake for me, just like... nope, i'm just going to hide for as long as I possibly can the moment the boss steps away.

She's out of town and they're not open today, so would someone be able to tell me if they're open tomorrow? If not she can go on Tuesday, but the sooner the better. Appreciate it and coffee or beverage of choice is on me in thanks!",0,1731279068.0,ottawa,5,0.38,False
