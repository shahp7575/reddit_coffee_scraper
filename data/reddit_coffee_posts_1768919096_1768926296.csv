We used to send very long messages (up to 10 lines sometimes) and he reassured me he loved them so I naturally kept them up. He met my entire family too. One day, he began to not reply to my messages but would be online all the time, so I questioned him because I felt ignored and he said that he was very busy with work and that my messages were getting a bit much and he didn’t know how to respond to them but that he would improve because he really liked me, etc. He would always reassure me when I asked for it but I could tell he just said the right thing to keep things calm, I’ve realised that now.

I messaged him 2 days later since he had left me on delivered for 3 days with no improvement like he said would happen and he broke up with me, saying that he had been thinking all week that he just couldn’t sustain the relationship anymore and that he wasn’t in the right headspace to maintain one right now. He offered friendship, took me out once as friends and then said he would love to meet for a coffee but never turned up or said he had to cancel. Totally ghosted me. He told me that his friends knew about me but I later found out they didn’t even know he was seeing anyone, never mind me specifically. I got very angry and said that I never felt like his girlfriend, especially after his dog died and he didn’t tell me until 2 weeks after and only because I was going to his house.

I was absolutely heartbroken and did the stupid thing of messaging his friends, which is how I know they had no idea about me. They eventually asked my ex about it and he said that he told me that he didn’t see things working out and that he didn’t want to see me again when in reality he did the exact opposite. His friends told me to fuck off and tbat they had nothing to do with this, which is fair enough but I feel like I totally ruined the relationship. He’s left me with so many questions about what I’ve done wrong but in the relationship he was so polite and gentlemanly, but he was anxious as hell. Apologising for absolutely everything you can imagine, very small things.

Maybe I'm just lazy, but my strategy is simpler: only touch it when I'm doing nothing anyway.

My ""dead time"" protocol:

Morning coffee / scrolling news: Log in, do the daily spin, click the 4 PTC ads (~2 mins)
Boring work meeting (camera off): Let a game from their offerwall run idle on my phone. (~30 mins of ""passive"" earning).
Waiting in line/commuting: Check if any ""mystery boxes"" are available, maybe click a few more ads.

Results after a month: Approximately $18 in Bitcoin. No surveys, no tedious offers, no ""grinding.""

The mental shift that made it work: I stopped viewing it as ""work"" and started viewing it as ""claiming a reward for time I was already wasting."" The moment it feels like a chore, I close the app.

I’m a 32 yo M and Chinese. 5”10, slim fit from Canada. I work in the healthcare field. I would say I’m a good balance of staying within Chinese culture but also as my friends put it “white-washed.”  So the best of both worlds! 

I will say immediately I’m not really an AM that is into anime, k-pop, k- dramas, etc. I do however like bubble tea (moreso the smoothie type ones as I find the more thirst-quenching!). I also enjoy iced coffee!

I love sports! I watch NHL, MLB and NFL mainly. I also played competitive hockey and lacrosse growing up which for AM was rare growing up. Nowadays I play golf and pickleball or tennis in my free time. 

People always ask what my type is…Personality wise- Someone fun to talk to, humble and who keeps me on my toes. Someone that I can't help but want to learn more about. Passion, a sense of humour and a flirty personality go a long way. If I admire someone it makes me much more motivated to satisfy them emotionally, spiritually and mentally. I would love someone who has a solid, stable career but has a good work-fun balance as well. She would also enjoy watching sports or at least be open to it. 

Physical attraction is an important aspect too for me. So ideally we’d swap pics early on so we don’t waste each other’s time. I am attracted to brunettes but blondes can apply too haha I love a woman who is active/fit in the gym/plays sports as well (does Pilates/yoga, loves wearing ALO, Lululemon, etc). Someone who plays golf would be amazing but not required. 

Location-wise I’m open to US, Canada, Australia or Europe. I’d hope you are willing to relocate. Not that I’m not but it would be difficult given job logistics but that would be open for discussion if we get there. 

Ideally, we’d chat a bit on Reddit and exchange pics. If theres a good connection we would then move to something like discord where we can chat further and start with a voice chat moving to video chat given it’s probably gonna start long distance.

Before freezing, the coffees had already rested 3–4 days post-roast for lowest rested bags (some slightly more, depending on roast date).

My question:

When light or very light coffees are vacuum-sealed and frozen after an initial rest, does freezing effectively pause degassing and aging? Or once thawed, should they still be treated like freshly roasted coffee and given a longer rest before brewing?

In practice, after thawing, is a short stabilization period (same day or 12–24 hours) sufficient, or do these high-density light roasts still benefit from additional resting?",1,1768925796.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1qi5em1,https://i.redd.it/seix8gqi4jeg1.jpeg,Chewy GI issues…again,"Hello, 

Some of you may remember Chewy! In September he had GI upset and had a bunch of tests done. They couldn't really find a reason they chalked it up to stress induced Colitis. (from being at the groomer for an extended visit) 

Well...he went in to have some mats shaved and and is back with the GI issues. 

Now, however, we put him on the chicken and rice immediately. However whenever we try to reintroduce kibble he goes right back to cow patty, watery stools. I am so confused, it is kibble he tolerates really well usually (Hills Science Small and Mini - Chicken). 

I am just wondering, has anyone else had a Shih Tzu with stress induced colitis? What have you done to help? I feel awful because I feel like the chicken and rice is fine but he isn't getting essential nutrients and I feel like he isn't getting enough calories. I am just at a loss and tired and really want to know what to do. Everything I do seems to be wrong. 

Facts: 

\+99% sure this is stress induced as it happened right after the groomer (nothing else happened) He doesn't go to daycare, wasn't around other dogs, didn't get into anything. 

\+He isn't showing signs of distress - not lethargic, gums look good, drinking and eating normally. Playful and sleeping normal. 

\+He is hungry and will eat 

\+He will have normal solid poos on the chicken and rice - as soon as kibble is introduced - mushy cow patty watery stools. 

\+Kibble was tolerated perfectly before all this

\+He is also on Purina Forti flora probiotic once daily in the morning. 

We do have a call into the vet since this is now day 18 of back and forth normal/abnormal stools.

I also use different flavored protein shakes and fat-free sugar-free puddings depending on what flavor ice cream I want. 

One Premier Protein shake OR Fairlife chocolate protein shake 

1/2 cup fat free Publix cottage cheese (makes the ice cream creamy AND YOU DON’T TASTE IT)

1/4 cup monkfruit with allulose 

1/2 -1 teaspoon LorAnn super strength flavor (to your taste)

1 tablespoon food grade vegetable glycerine

2 tablespoons sugar-free pudding mix (chocolate, vanilla, white chocolate, butterscotch, chocolate fudge, etc.)

1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum 

 I put all of that in the canister and then use an immersion blender until it is combined. 

I then take cashew milk, almond milk, etc.  (usually one cup) and fill up to the line and stir it with a spoon, or immersion blender, to incorporate the cashew milk. 

\* 1 tablespoon cocoa if you’re making chocolate. It makes the chocolate taste richer.

\*For caramel latte, I use 2 tablespoons of instant decaffeinated coffee powder, caramel protein drink, butterscotch pudding, LorAnn’s super strength carmel and/or coffee, along with the monk fruit, vanilla, cottage cheese, and xanthan gum as above. 

Put the canister in the freezer for 24 hours and the next night, spin it on light ice cream. You don’t usually need to re-spin it. Add the mix-in rather than re-spin.

Mix-ins I use: a couple of Oreos chocolate or vanilla; coconut; peanut butter cups; Heath Bits, Butterfinger Bits; chocolate chips (I put half a bag in my food processor to make them smaller before putting them in as a mix-in because when they’re big, if they freeze, they’re very difficult to bite down on)

\*\* if you like Tootsie Rolls,  add in orange juice to top it off rather than the cashew milk and/or  super strength orange extract from LoreAnn‘s(My favorite!)

I believe that the book was called ""How to Make Your Own Science Fair Project"" but searching that or any variation doesnt give me the book from my childhood. I had it in 6th-7th grade.

The book was explaining the scientific method to kids, and how to come up with a 1st prize idea for the science fair.

There was a section either called ""old Dog, new Tricks"" or ""New Dog, Old Tricks"" talking about how you shouldn't do an experiment done before. It uses the example of an experiment where someone tested to see if flowers that had music played grew faster than those without music (Yes). The book says not to repeat it  but you can add a twist. Again using that example, The book said you can do an experiment where you see what genre of music makes flowers grow faster.

The interior of the book, its design was again looking like a notebook, the pages looked like lined loose leaf but felt like card stock, there was sticky notes inside (again as designs) a couple of the pages even had coffee rings. It was designed to look like a used notebook. 

I remember it being not about making a science experiment, but actually building a science fair project, so it'd geared towards 5th-9th grade. there was a section about laying out your project information on the display boards, having queue cards and practicing your lines in case judges walked by and asked questions.

I haven't taken my venlafaxine or my vitamin, but I have another one that I take at night. Should I record a video showing how I take all of that? I don't know, I'm a little tired and fed up. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I'm drinking a lot of coffee, and I don't know what to do or what to say anymore. I see that I'm deteriorating. How much longer will I pretend? I'm fine, believe me, I just need to finish and express myself so I can move on.


Is there crying? Is there happiness? Is there anger? I want to end it all. I'm trying to write properly because the previous post wasn't very clear. I'm trying to sound like someone in a good state, like an imitator, even knowing how useless I am. I do nothing, I never get out of bed, I'm lazy, I'm always dirty. Today I just splashed myself with cold water, and I think that's why I'm trembling so much. It wasn't even that cold, only about 12 degrees. I hope I die and stop being a burden on my family. I have no future, that's what I want to believe, because unlike others, I know everything I have to do. I have everything I could possibly need, and yet I still want to cry, kill, take my precious life, and play. Can't you see I'm fine? I'm just a human throwing a tantrum.

The more I write, the more I control myself; the more I narrate, the calmer I become. There are several ways to do it, but I can't do any of them. I've done so many bad things that people would hate me, or maybe not. I'm nobody, just someone with a great future ahead of them, better than many, and who is willing to help others, and yet I don't want to. I want to stay in bed until I rot, until my mind fails and I can only breathe carbon dioxide.

What would be more terrifying?

Committing suicide without knowing who you are?

Or
Committing suicide knowing who you are and what you can do?

Maybe both. Many do it because they can't find another alternative or because they want to end their suffering. I do it because there's no reason, just to do it. I have some disorders that are diagnosed, like ADHD, which I was diagnosed with because I was only taken to a psychiatrist after I attempted suicide, and a little bit of autism. Something that's obvious is that I have severe depression, or whatever it's called. I don't know if I have anything else, and I think I do. The other thing I have is being stupid. Please stay calm. Should I post this on 4chan or here?

She was holding our daughter for the first time through the hospital room window because I banned her from the actual room. The nurse had stepped out and my husband went to get coffee. I was pretending to sleep but watching through the baby monitor app on my phone that I'd set up pointing at the hallway. She didn't know it had audio.

""Poor thing got her mother's features,"" she said to my sister-in-law who was standing next to her. ""I told him years ago she wasn't pretty enough for my bloodline.""

I have that video saved in three places now.

But I need to back up because the Thanksgiving thing is what actually got her banned forever, and people keep saying I went too far.

Two years ago my husband and I started trying for a baby. We'd been married for four years at that point and I was 29. His mom had been pestering us about grandchildren since literally our wedding reception. Every family dinner turned into questions about when we were going to ""make her a grandmother."" She bought baby clothes for holidays and put them in gift boxes for us like some kind of hint.

After a year of trying naturally my doctor suggested IVF. It's expensive and invasive and honestly I wasn't sure about it. My husband was supportive either way.

Then his mom offered to pay for it.

The whole thing. She said she had money set aside and she desperately wanted to be a grandmother before she got too old. She cried and hugged me and said she just wanted to see her son have the family he deserved. I actually felt touched. I thought maybe we were finally bonding.

My husband thought it was generous but weird. ""She's never offered to pay for anything before,"" he said.

I convinced him to accept. It felt like a peace offering after years of her being cold to me.

We did three rounds. The first two didn't take. The third one worked. I got pregnant last December.

His mom was overjoyed. She threw us a surprise party. She started buying nursery furniture. She showed up with groceries and helped me with morning sickness. It felt like she actually cared about me for the first time since I'd known her.

Then my sister-in-law texted me in March.

""I need to tell you something about mom and I don't know how.""

She sent me screenshots. Text messages between her and my mother-in-law from two years ago, right before the IVF offer.

""I can't stand looking at her face across the table anymore. If he gives me ugly grandchildren I'll never forgive him.""

""She's got that weak chin and those small eyes. Our family has good genes and he's wasting them.""

""Maybe if they do IVF they can screen for better features? I read about that. At least the baby won't be 100% her genetics that way.""

There were dozens of messages. She'd googled whether IVF could ""select for attractiveness."" She'd asked my sister-in-law if there was a way to suggest genetic screening without being obvious. She'd literally strategized how to get us to do IVF because she thought it would somehow make our baby less likely to look like me.

My sister-in-law said she'd kept quiet because she didn't want to ruin my pregnancy but her mom had been making comments lately about ""hoping the baby takes after dad's side"" and she couldn't take it anymore.

I sat in my car in a parking lot and cried for two hours.

My husband was traveling for work. I didn't tell him right away because I wanted to think about how to handle it. His mom and I had plans to go shopping for baby clothes that weekend and I cancelled. She called me three times asking if everything was okay with the pregnancy.

I started avoiding her. I stopped answering calls. When my husband asked why I was being distant I said I was tired and hormonal.

She showed up at our house in April with a bag of preemie clothes because ""the baby might come early and you should be prepared."" She tried to hug me and I physically stepped back. The look on her face was confused and a little hurt.

""Is something wrong?"" she asked.

""No,"" I said. ""I'm just tired.""

My husband pulled me aside after she left. ""What's going on with you and my mom? She's really worried.""

I still didn't tell him. Part of me wanted to protect him from it. Part of me was worried he wouldn't believe me or would defend her.

I planned to wait until after the baby was born. Just get through the pregnancy and then deal with it.

But then Thanksgiving happened.

We hosted at our house because I was eight months pregnant and didn't want to travel. My mother-in-law brought her famous sweet potatoes and wore a shirt that said ""Grandma's Little Blessing"" with an arrow pointing down at my stomach.

Everyone was there. My parents, my husband's dad and stepmom, his siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins. Twenty-three people crammed into our house.

Dinner was fine at first. Normal conversation. My mother-in-law kept touching my stomach without asking and I kept moving her hand away but I didn't make a scene.

Then she stood up during dessert and clinked her glass.

""I just want to say how grateful I am that we're all here together,"" she said. ""And I'm so excited to meet my first grandbaby in just a few weeks. I've been waiting for this for so long.""

She looked directly at me with this warm smile.

""I'm thankful that I could help make this happen. That I could give my son and his wife this gift.""

People clapped. My husband squeezed my hand under the table.

And something inside me just snapped.

I stood up. I was shaking.

""Actually,"" I said. ""Since you brought it up. I think everyone should know why you really paid for our IVF.""

The room went completely silent.

My mother-in-law's smile froze. ""What?""

I pulled out my phone. I'd saved the screenshots in a folder. I connected my phone to our TV and pulled them up on the screen.

""These are text messages you sent to your daughter two years ago,"" I said. My voice was surprisingly steady. ""Right before you offered to pay for our fertility treatments.""

I read them out loud. Every single one.

""I can't stand looking at her face across the table anymore.""

""If he gives me ugly grandchildren I'll never forgive him.""

""She's got that weak chin and those small eyes.""

""Maybe if they do IVF they can screen for better features.""

My husband's face went white. His dad started to stand up. My mother-in-law was making this choking sound.

""You paid for IVF because you thought it would make our baby less likely to look like me,"" I said. ""You thought you could genetically engineer your way out of having an ugly daughter-in-law's genes in your precious bloodline.""

""That's not—I didn't mean—"" she was stammering.

""You screenshotted articles about genetic selection,"" I said. ""You googled 'can IVF prevent ugly babies.'""

I showed that screenshot too. Her search history. My sister-in-law had sent me everything.

My husband stood up so fast his chair fell backward.

""Get out,"" he said to his mother. His voice was shaking. ""Get the fuck out of my house.""

""Honey, please, I was just—""

""OUT.""

She tried to move toward him and he actually stepped in front of me. Protective.

""You insulted my wife,"" he said. ""You manipulated us. You tried to play genetics like we're fucking breeding dogs. Get out before I throw you out.""

His dad stood up. ""Come on, we're leaving.""

My mother-in-law was crying. ""I just wanted pretty grandchildren, is that so wrong? I paid so much money—""

""You paid money to insult my wife for nine months while pretending to care about her,"" my husband said. ""You smiled in her face while calling her ugly behind her back. You touched her stomach and bought baby clothes while hoping our daughter wouldn't look like her. You're a monster.""

""I'm your mother!""

""You're nothing to me right now. Leave.""

His sister grabbed her purse. ""I'm sorry,"" she mouthed to me.

They left. Half the family left with them. The other half stayed and my mom hugged me while I cried.

My husband held me all night. He apologized probably fifty times. ""I had no idea,"" he kept saying. ""I'm so sorry. I should have seen it.""

He called his mom the next day and told her she was not welcome at the hospital when the baby came. She was not welcome at our house. She was not welcome in our daughter's life until she could genuinely apologize to me, and maybe not even then.

She sent flowers with a card that said ""I'm sorry you misunderstood.""

My husband threw them in the trash.

Our daughter was born three weeks later. Healthy and perfect. And yes, she has my chin and my eyes.

That's when my mother-in-law showed up at the hospital and made the comment about her being ""plain-looking."" I have it on video. She didn't know I was recording.

My husband watched the video once and then blocked his mother's number.

It's been four months. She's sent letters. She's sent more flowers. She's had relatives call us saying we're keeping her from her only grandchild and it's cruel.

My husband's dad divorced her last month. Apparently this wasn't the first time she'd said horrible things about people's appearances and he was done.

My daughter is beautiful. She has my eyes and my husband's smile and tiny perfect fingers and when she laughs her whole face scrunches up.

But I still can't look in the mirror without hearing ""weak chin, small eyes, unfortunately plain.""

And I wonder if I went too far. If I should have handled it privately. If publicly humiliating her at Thanksgiving was an asshole move even though she deserved it.

My sister-in-law says I gave her what she had coming. My mom says I protected my daughter from a lifetime of comparisons and veiled insults. My husband says he's proud of me for standing up for myself.

But she's his mother. And she's banned from ever meeting her granddaughter now. And I'm the one who made that happen.

So I guess I'm asking, am I an asshole for exposing her at Thanksgiving instead of dealing with it quietly?

In Spanish, this is known as *La Marca del Hombre Lob*o.  Our story begins at a party for young Countess Janice Von Aarenberg (Dyanik Zurakowska).  She is dancing with her childhood friend Rudolph (Manuel Manzaneque) when a dark and handsome stranger appears.  It is Count Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy).  Janice is entranced and soon falls in love with Waldemar, much to the annoyance of the often pouty Rudolph.

But fate has a cruel surprise!  A Romani couple who have come to town get drunk and then, having decided to rob graves and look for jewels, break into the crypt of werewolf Imre Wolfstein.  In fairness, they do not know he was a werewolf, although one would think they would get a little suspicious when they find a perfectly preserved body with a silver dagger in its chest.  However, proving again that natural selection is always at work, they remove the silver dagger and are promptly torn to pieces by the revived werewolf.

Wolfstein now goes on a rampage.  He is about to kill Rudolph when Waldemar saves him, driving the dagger back into the werewolf’s chest.  But, in the process, Waldemar is bitten!  Now he is cursed with lycanthropy!

Rudolph, whose near-death experience has opened his eyes to the basic nobility of the brooding Count Daninsky, dedicates himself to helping his new friend.  He writes to the mysterious Dr. Janos Mikhelov, who is supposed to be an expert in lycanthropy.  But when Mikhelov (Julian Ugarte) and his wife Wandesa (Aurora de Alba) show up, they are a strange and sinister couple.  What do they want?  Can Waldemar still be saved from the curse?

This is the first in the long series of films featuring Paul Naschy as the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky.  It is all right if you watch them out of order, though; the movies are mostly unconnected stories except for the presence of the main character.

The best way to enjoy this movie is probably to take it as pure melodrama.  Do not watch it expecting psychological nuance or gritty realism.  It is full of color and passion and shadows and dungeons and werewolves leaping on people.  It also has some curious editing choices.  It is not unlike a Hammer Horror film, except it is in Spanish and it seems to have had a little too much coffee this morning.

Objectively, it is not a very good movie, but it is so over-the-top some people will still find it fun.  I recommend watching it in the original Spanish with English subtitles.

I've just found a few days ago that I am LI, more specifically LCT-13910C>T C/C type, and have had it at least since Jan 2025(year ago).

Why it took me so long to figure it out?  
Symptoms were mild and in no way reminded me LI symptoms I've ever heard of.  
I've had no diarrhea, there was no obvious connection between eating something with milk and stomach pains. Also I was drinking coffee with milk 1-2 times every day(150-300 ml milk every day), eating some yogurt/cottage cheese a few days every week and it had no correlation with stomach pains.  
Last month it got worse and I even developed some symptoms that reminded gluten intolerance! What's even weirder, they got better when I started eating gluten free! But I've had some tests done with doctor's advice and they were all negative for all signs of gluten intolerance(no antibodies, no infalmmation markers, etc). Together with gluten tests I've also had lactase gene checked and that's how I've found that I have LI.  
I've also bought some lactase pills and my stomach doesn't even hurt anymore no matter what I eat last two days! Pretty great!

I wrote this post for someone who may have the same issues in the future to show that LI is not the same for everyone and can appear like something else for a while!

TL;DR: had no typical LI symptoms like diarrhea, no obvious connection from eating milk products to stomach pains, in the end symptoms reminded gluten intolerance, eventually turned out it was caused by lactose intolerance",2,1768924556.0,lactoseintolerant,0,1.0,False

1qi4tgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1qi4tgk/update_returning_from_winter_break_to_the/,Update: Returning from winter break to the apartment being in shambles,"Hi everyone. Thank you so much for the advice on my last post. Unfortunately, I’m back with another update and I really need guidance on what to do next. **TL;DR on the bottom of my post!** 

I was gone for winter break from December 17 to January 19. I expected to come home to some level of mess, but what I walked into was far worse than anything I anticipated.

Before I even stepped inside the apartment, I was hit with the most putrid smell I have ever experienced. And that’s saying a lot, because I work in healthcare and I’m used to bodily fluids and awful odors. This was overwhelming. As I started looking around, it only got worse.

The trash had not been taken out since before I left, *when I took it out*. It was overflowing and had clearly been sitting there for weeks. She had started piling additional trash on top of my trash can, which has already been the victim of many of her crimes.

All of the dishes were dirty in the dishwasher, including pots and *only my containers* that previously had chili in them, now permanently stained. The food had completely rotted. In every bowl she used, the food was peeling back from the sides like a really bad sunburn. The smell was so bad it made me gag. On top of that, she burned a candle and left it sitting in the living room. Thankfully it wasn’t my candle, but candles are not allowed by the lease since we live in student housing. She also chipped wood off my coffee table, which I spent a lot of time refurbishing, painting, and waxing. She used my Keurig, as expected (the reason  I hid all of my coffee pods), and left an old coffee pod inside that had molded. I had to take the entire section out and run it under hot water just to remove it. There is STILL food in the fridge from when she moved in and still food in the cabinets dating back to October. 

The sink and counters were disgusting. The garbage disposal smelled awful. There was food and moldy black residue in the sink. There were crumbs, food residue, and literal handprints everywhere, which I am hoping were not sticky residue from her fondling her boyfriend. There was food burnt on to the stove and somehow splattered on the stove hood (again) with no attempt to wipe it up. It was clear that something had boiled over and began spilling into the oven. There is a pizza box in the fridge that has clearly been sitting there far too long. There are many dead gnats in her wax warmer, which she tried to change the scent of and spilled everywhere. And my personal favorite, more bacon in the freezer, another bacon crime scene for those who remember.

After a three-hour drive back to campus, unloading my car, documenting everything, and unpacking, I immediately had to take the trash out and basically perform CPR on my poor trash can. I then had to clean the kitchen just so I could make something to eat for dinner. While cooking, I had to fish out not one but two gnats from my pasta water. These bugs either came from the air or found their way into the cabinet and my pasta box.

I want to be very clear about this. I have photos of how I left the apartment before I went away, and I also took videos immediately after returning, walking through and describing everything I saw and smelled. I did this specifically so there would be no confusion about the condition I left the apartment in versus what I returned to.

This is not a one-time issue. There has been a long pattern of boundary violations, refusal to communicate, and disrespect for shared spaces and my belongings. I have already told her that we need to sit down and reestablish boundaries. She has completely ignored that and refuses to have a serious conversation. Because of this, all communication has been in writing so I can document everything. At this point, I don't even talk to her. I avoid her at all costs because just hearing her walk around the apartment gives me severe anxiety. She's not someone I can be friends with any longer. I have tried to be nice and respectful and that hasn't worked. The only time I've ever gotten peace in this apartment was my ONE glorious week of giving her the silent treatment. 

For a long time now, I have not felt comfortable or safe living here. The sanitation issues alone are a health hazard. I cannot live in an apartment that smells like decomposing food and trash. Some of the mess has been a literal biohazard, including baby wipes with feces left sitting in the living room for three weeks. 

At this point, I’m planning to contact student housing (skipping my apartment manager until I know my options, if there are any) to request emergency housing placement because this no longer feels like a livable situation. I don’t even know if my school offers this, but I’m going to try and hope for the best. I'm hoping that an emergency placement situation will help me avoid paying lease breaking fees and get me into somewhere I can feel safe. 

I really need advice on two things. **What should I say, or not say, to my roommate at this point, if anything at all?** The state she left the apartment in was completely unacceptable. She also checked my location while I was driving back, so she knew I was on my way and still chose to leave this mess for me to deal with.

**What should I tell housing to make it clear that this is urgent and not just a roommate conflict?** I do have photo and video evidence. To be honest, this is both conflict and a biohazard, but I’m worried that if I frame it as conflict they’ll just tell me to communicate again, which I’ve already tried repeatedly with no success.

I’m exhausted, stressed, and honestly shocked that someone could leave a shared apartment like this. Any advice on next steps or wording would be incredibly appreciated. Thank you.

**TL;DR:** I was gone from Dec 17 to Jan 19 and came back to an apartment filled with weeks-old trash, rotting food, mold, gnats, lease violations, and damage to my belongings. I have photos of how I left the apartment and videos documenting what I returned to. This is part of a long pattern of sanitation issues and refusal to communicate, and some of the mess is a literal biohazard. I’m seeking advice on what to say to my roommate and how to approach housing for emergency placement without being told to just “communicate again.”",3,1768924505.0,badroommates,1,1.0,False

The interview would be about **1–1.5 hours**, very low-key setup (small camera + mics), and respectful of the space. Think more conversational than “production.” I would also obtain B-Roll of the venue for the interview as well.

Coffee shops, breweries with quieter areas, libraries, coworking spaces, or other unique spots are all fair game. Open to Fletcher / South Asheville suggestions too.

Hey guys, so what I am and what I want to see in my partner is pretty different from what majority of gen z are.

I am 20 yo. I have a bachelor degree and a stable nice job, I love:

\\\\- Fashion

\\\\- Opera

\\\\- Literature ( beat generation, retro detectives around Agha Christie times, realism, dystopian fiction) I absolutely dislike modern literature btw))

\\\\- I also do love watching films and tv shows, not a fan of modern cinematography, mostly I watch old movies and shows, I love surrealistic cinema, neo-noir, existential horror, avant-garde.

I don’t like video games much (even tho I can play them with my little brother when I visit my family) , I don’t like watching sports, I love to play sports only.

I do go to gym, I love to cook and especially I love to recreate restaurant level serving when guests visit me.

I do have clear goals and plan on reaching them. But I also have a messy side. Rarely, but I do love to party and mix all of the drinks possible and then get into a risky behaviour for fun, I have never ever tried any drugs and never going to, alcohol with cigarettes only. On regular days I never drink alcohol tho and absolutely never ever smoke and never was addicted to it.

I come from a family with a nice financial background, we were never rich, just an upper class. So I got used to some good perfumes and jewellery.

I absolutely wouldn’t like my husband to play video games, watch football or any sports, and it might sound controversial…but I absolutely wouldn’t like him to drink alcohol, probably… because I can control what and how I drink ,but I don’t want to control another person and guide them.

I would like us to share interests that I have, so we would never run out of topics to discuss and had a lot of in common. I honestly do feel lonely in this world where people have drastically different interests from me , so I would like  my husband to share them with me at least.

I don’t know where could I find such guy as I described, I honestly don’t want a chronically online guy, I want a guy that will get a job to provide for our family and not do weird thing like 50/50 financially (I grew up around people where man is a provider).

And I also wouldn’t like him to be arrogant, reading books and listening to Italian opera doesn’t make u better than others, omg…. I can’t stand when people with such interests think that they have all the rights to put on airs.

So, I honestly have no idea where to find such guy. I finished a graphic design uni, so I obvi didn’t find any people like that over there, I have tinder…but I’m not sure if I can get a nice guy there too. I’m tired..

Edit: I don’t like that on tinder guys ask u out very fast, it’s so weird and annoying. How can u go out with a girl about who you know absolutely nothing? And it’s so weird to ask a lady out to get drinks or coffee date xd.

We used to send very long messages (up to 10 lines sometimes) and he reassured me he loved them so I naturally kept them up. One day, he began to not reply to my messages but would be online all the time, so I questioned him because I felt ignored and he said that he was very busy with work and that my messages were getting a bit much but that he would improve because he really liked me, etc.

I messaged him 2 days later since he had left me on delivered for 3 days with no improvement like he said would happen and he broke up with me, saying that he had been thinking all week that he just couldn’t sustain the relationship anymore and that he wasn’t in the right headspace to maintain one right now.

I got very angry and said that I never felt like his girlfriend, especially after his dog died and he didn’t tell me until 2 weeks after and only because I was going to his house.

I was absolutely heartbroken and did the stupid thing of messaging his friends, which is how I know they had no idea about me. They eventually asked my ex about it and he said that he told me that he didn’t see things weren’t out and that he didn’t want to see me again when in reality he did the exact opposite. His friends told me to fuck off and tbat they had nothing to do with this, which is fair enough but I feel like I totally ruined the relationship.

At least I can sit in the pool on Star. Does anybody like this feature, or is it super annoying to split up your party for pool activities?

1qi478a,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qi478a/how_to_be_magnetic_without_being_hot_the/,How to Be MAGNETIC Without Being Hot: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Let me tell you something wild. I spent years thinking attraction was all about looks, working out obsessively, buying expensive clothes, trying to look ""perfect."" Then I met this guy at a networking event who was objectively average looking. Balding, dad bod, the works. But within 10 minutes, everyone at the table was leaning in when he spoke. Women were finding excuses to touch his arm. Men wanted to be his friend. That's when I realized I'd been chasing the wrong thing entirely.



So I went down a research rabbit hole. Books, podcasts, psychology studies, body language experts. Turns out, charisma beats conventional attractiveness almost every time. And here's the kicker, it's completely learnable.



The eye contact thing everyone gets wrong



Most people either avoid eye contact or do that creepy stare thing. The sweet spot? Hold eye contact for 3,4 seconds, look away naturally, then come back. Dr. Jack Schafer from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Program calls this the ""friendship formula"" in his work on influence. It signals confidence without aggression.



Practice this literally everywhere. Coffee shops, grocery stores, random conversations. Your brain rewires faster than you think.



Your voice matters more than your words



I started listening to ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane and holy shit, this book changed everything. Cabane worked with Fortune 500 execs and breaks down presence, power, and warmth into actual techniques. The audiobook is insanely good because you can hear how she modulates her own voice for impact.



One trick that WORKS: speak from your diaphragm, not your throat. Slower pace, slight pauses before important words. Politicians and actors do this constantly. It makes people perceive you as more thoughtful and authoritative.



The proximity principle nobody talks about



Dr. Robert Cialdini's research on influence shows that simply being physically present in someone's space (appropriately) increases likability by like 60%. Not hovering, just existing in the same orbit consistently.



Join communities, show up to the same coffee shop, be the regular somewhere. Familiarity breeds comfort, comfort breeds attraction. It's basic psychology but people ignore it because it's not sexy advice.



Master the art of active listening



Downloaded Ash a few months back for relationship coaching stuff. The app has this whole module on validation techniques that's borderline magical. Ask open ended questions, repeat back what someone says with ""So what you're saying is..."" and watch them light up.



People are so starved for genuine attention. When you give it, they associate that dopamine hit with YOUR presence. That's charisma in its purest form.



The ""charisma gap"" is about energy management



Read ""Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People"" by Vanessa Van Edwards after hearing her on a podcast. She ran studies analyzing thousands of hours of TED talks to figure out what makes someone magnetic. Best chapter: how to match someone's energy level without being fake.



If someone's excited, you get excited. If they're contemplative, you slow down. It's called mirroring and it happens subconsciously when people vibe, but you can do it intentionally.



Stop trying to be interesting, be interested



This sounds like fortune cookie BS but hear me out. I started using the FORD method (Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams) in conversations. People will literally tell their friends about you afterward because you made them feel SEEN.



There's also ""How to Talk to Anyone"" by Leil Lowndes, 92 tricks that sound gimmicky but work stupidly well. The book won awards for communication training and Lowndes coached everyone from CEOs to politicians.



Another thing that's been useful is [BeFreed](https://share.google/xRE3d2mmWgCIMCV79), an AI learning app that creates personalized podcasts from books, research papers, and expert talks. You tell it what you want to work on, like social skills or communication, and it pulls from quality sources to build you an adaptive learning plan. 



What's practical about it is you can customize the depth. Start with a 10 minute overview of a concept, and if it clicks, switch to a 40 minute deep dive with examples. The virtual coach Freedia lets you pause mid episode to ask questions or clarify ideas, which is helpful when you're trying to actually apply this stuff. Plus you can adjust the voice, some people prefer something energetic for commutes, others want something calmer. It covers all the books mentioned here and keeps adding more content.



The smile has to reach your eyes



Fake smiles activate different facial muscles than real ones. People clock this instantly even if they don't realize it consciously. Start genuinely finding things amusing or interesting about people and your smile changes automatically.



Body language checklist that takes 2 seconds



Shoulders back, chin parallel to ground, take up space (not aggressively, just don't make yourself small). Open posture, uncrossed arms. This isn't about ""faking confidence,"" it's about changing your physiology which then changes your psychology. Amy Cuddy's research on power poses got some criticism but the basic premise holds up.



The scarcity mindset will kill your charisma



If you're desperate for approval, people smell it a mile away. Work on this with apps like Finch for habit building around self worth stuff. The app gamifies personal growth and honestly helped me stop seeking external validation so much.



When you're comfortable with yourself, it radiates. That's what people mean by ""confidence is attractive."" It's not arrogance, it's just being genuinely OK with who you are.



Storytelling is your secret weapon



Take any normal experience and structure it with setup, conflict, resolution. I learned this from improv podcasts like ""Do You F\*cking Mind?"" which breaks down social dynamics in a way that's actually useful.



People remember stories, not facts. If you can make someone laugh or feel something during a 2 minute story, you're memorable.



Look, this isn't about manipulation or pretending to be someone you're not. It's about removing the barriers between your actual personality and how the world perceives you. Most people are WAY more interesting than they present themselves as.



The science backs this up consistently across psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics research. Charisma is pattern recognition plus emotional intelligence plus genuine curiosity. All trainable skills.



Your appearance might get someone's attention for 5 seconds. Charisma keeps it for 5 hours. Master this and watch how differently people respond to you.",1,1768923150.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Exams often go hand in hand with frantic late night cramming sessions, endless cups of coffee and a general sense of panic.

What's more, in addition to their capacity for nerve shredding, our recent survey on exam nerves also revealed that they can actually stop people from studying the subject of their choice – or even put them off their chosen career altogether.

But exams remain an important part of education and developing strategies to deal with pressure can prove hugely beneficial in life.

So, what are some of the best ways of dealing with exam nerves?

I'm getting married in a hotel, and everyone is coming from out of town. A month ago, a friend from college told me that she had broken up with her partner, and we talked about it and she said she would come alone after all. She and I don't talk much, and if we've seen each other in the last 15 years, it's because I made the effort to travel to visit her about three times. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with cancer, and I kept in touch more regularly, although she hardly responded, and I understood that she wasn't up for it, but it never bothered me, of course. I tried to support her and show my interest in knowing that she was okay. About 12 years ago, I went through a difficult situation, among many others, with relationship problems, alone abroad, and I hit rock bottom. When I sought contact with friends, all I got from her was, “Don't tell me these negative things that make me uncomfortable.” So I didn't tell her anything else about my life. I understood that I shouldn't burden anyone with my problems, and I continued on my own, but I went to visit her and everything, just to maintain the friendship. But I always felt that my problems didn't matter and that if I wanted to maintain friendships, I shouldn't share my sorrows. I am a person who strives for others, and the truth is that because of this, I have taken many blows and suffered from depression many times.

A few years ago, she came to visit my city, and I was happy, after years of inviting her and saying that I would love to do something together, but she never took the initiative, or only gave negative responses. When she told me she was coming to my city, but only a day in advance, I couldn't organize my work schedule and we couldn't meet. Once again, I understood, and I thought that it wasn't going to happen this time, but that was okay. Accepted.

Years passed, then the pandemic hit, and she wrote to me to tell me about her breast cancer, and obviously I wanted to show her my support. We talked more often for a while. When she recovered, her long-term partner broke up with her because they hadn't had the same goals for years, but it seems they're still friends. I'm happy for them, because I felt terrible about their breakup, since I was there when they started dating and helped them get together. Since then, she is trying to rebuild her life. obviusly is hard, and I absolutly agree. I thought inviting her would be something positive for her. And she was one of the first friends that came to my mind after the proposal.

I've been through a lot of shit these past few years and I haven't told anyone about it. I've been hitting rock bottom again due to many private and work-related upsets, and my health has suffered, but it's not cancer. I know that. And I don't victimize myself for it. I just notice that my heart and my health have chronic problems and I've had a few scares.

A year ago, my partner proposed to me. After a huge crisis, we gave ourselves a year to see if we could overcome our problems and work things out. We saw that we could, and I finally felt like I was starting to be happy. He proposed to me, and honestly, after so many years of struggles and depression, it finally seems like I have some peace. Since then is amazing between us. It has taken a lot of personal effort. We all need to feel loved and cared for. I try to show my friends how much I care and take care of what little I have, but I don't consider myself to be overly intense. I also protect my self and I am cautious to open to people. And now I have friends who tell me they love me and what a good friend I am, and that makes me happy.

The thing with this friend is that I've always felt that it's not mutual, even though she tells me she loves me and that I always make her laugh, but I feel like she avoids me or ignores my needs. I feel I was 15 years waiting for responses from her. It was allways me making the moovements. I stopped asking to see her years ago because I felt like she was dragging me down. When I sent her the wedding invitation five months later, with the date and location, she left me on read. I wrote to her two weeks later, and I don't want to be self-centered, but two weeks seems like a long time to me, especially for something so big and that doesn't happen every day, which is an invitation to my wedding.

I just wrote to her that it hurt me that she always ignored my messages and that I understand she's not in the best place right now, but that didn't mean she couldn't reply to that concrete message. I wasn't inviting her to my city or for a coffee, but for a special day in my life. She told me that she couldn't maintain a relationship right now and that her life was in turmoil, and that I should understand. I told her that I respected that, but that it still hurt me. I decided to wait, because I've also had depression, and everyone deals with it in their own way, but it's been nine months since that message, and because of her message, I have this nagging feeling of not knowing whether she's coming or not, whether not being able to maintain relationships meant she wasn't coming at all, or if it was just a momentary expression. And I waited, and waited, and waited for a moment when she maybe has a a good day, when she would remember me and ask me something, or say anything to me. But that moment never came. I wished her a happy birthday, thinking that maybe that would restart our conversation. But she just replied, “Thanks for the birthday wishes, I appreciate you remembering.” And I thought it was a very impersonal response for a friendship like ours.

Everyone else had asked me at least: what day is it? What's the name of the town? How do I book a hotel? Or some comment like, I can't wait to see you... And from her, NOTHING. ok...

I have to start wrapping up preparations. I know that a wedding isn't the center of the universe, and I've never felt that way, but it does require dedication, and everyone knows that. Hotels are running out of reservations, I have to let the caterer know what people will be eating and how many people will be attending, etc. They're asking me to let them know by next week at the latest. Everyone has been informing me and confirming over the last 12 months. Some earlier, some later.

I don't know how understanding I should be, but it's killing me not to be able to move forward with my preparations and just wait. And since I was the one who insisted, and she told me she couldn't maintain the relationship, I didn't pressure her. But she promised me that we would take a trip together before the wedding, as a bachelorette party. And obviously that's not going to happen now.

I've been sad, quite sad, but I've tried to ignore it and focus on those who have shown interest in me. And it's gone well 90% of the time.

Yesterday I had an anxiety attack and wrote her a text that I had already worked on many other times when her distance had made me cry, and I told her that at this point it was better for me to withdraw my invitation because I can't spend my whole life waiting for something to happen in our relationship, which I feel is not reciprocal and never has been, and that although I know she cares for me in some way, his message that she couldn't sustain the relationship left me in limbo, full of doubts. She got upset and told me that she was also disappointed in me for not understanding that she is depressed and that she said she couldn't sustain the relationship, and that “kmon! When did I say I wasn't going to go?”... and that's exactly why I say: if you tell me you're going to go, at least don't leave me like this; I would have preferred you to tell me that you weren't feeling well emotionally and that you were sorry you couldn't attend, and I would have got on with my life. Her response yesterday, without any attempt to understand my position, was that I demand too much and that she is disappointed. I need her, and she can't give me what I'm asking for. And I ask myself: what am I asking for? If we talk once a year or every two years... I know you have depression, but is that incompatible with having emotional responsibility for the people around you? Is it my fault for wanting to know something??

I already told her that it was important for me to have some kind of answer on this issue at some point. I think nine months is enough time and space to have thought about me, without feeling pressured.

I told her that any more space than that is equivalent to zero, and that I never ask for anything. But I feel that I respect her needs, but she doesn't even consider mine.

I've been feeling anxious for two days now, with chest pain and trouble sleeping, because I feel guilty for having written to her.

My partner tells me that I'm wrong to feel bad, but this pain won't go away, even with anxiety pills, that I've been patient and haven't asked for too much, but rather very little, and that I've communicated patiently, with plenty of time and assertiveness, but that she's not willing to make an effort to understand me. And the truth is, I believe the same thing. But my chest burns with pain, and instead of being happy about the preparations, I feel terrible and that none of my friends care enough about me to even throw me a bachelorette party. She got my hopes up that we could have a bachelorette party for me, together, and I was so happy that she was finally taking the initiative, but she got my hopes up for nothing. I think her behavior towards me is selfish. She told me, that hoppefully someday I know what depression is... But the truth is, she doesnt even know a little about me. We never talked about me.

She has been traveling, doing things to get her life back on track. She tells me she is focusing on finding friends and nurturing friendships, and she tells me this in response to having ignored me. Bravo! I feel invisible. What am I supposed to think? Sorry for inviting you to my wedding and giving you the importance that you don't give me? I thought my wedding would be a good excuse to reconnect and create memories?

Should I have taken the first message as a refusal to come and closed the chapter? Even though yesterday she told me she never said she wasn't coming? Should I have gone ahead with my plans without reserving a hotel room for her? If I already told her that I needed information at some point, and she asked for space, isn't it her responsibility to contact me? Could I have waited longer and then rearranged tables and looked for another hotel room in another hotel? Since the one for my wedding is no longer waiting. I think she could have at least apologized for not communicating, but instead she tells me that I need her and that she can't give me that. Her answers are starting to feel humiliating. As if I were a lapdog desperate for her. And we hardly ever talk.",2,1768922887.0,AIO,9,0.67,False

My daughter was dying, desperate for half a million-but my husband kicked us aside for his childhood sweetheart Lily. 

Then my first love Lucas Morgan stormed in like a hero with five million. 

Three months of playing daddy at her bedside. She died anyway. 

Six years later, carrying Lucas’s child, I catch him whispering to some doctor. 

“We had to take that heart for Lily. Rebecca’s got a new kid coming-she’ll never figure it out.” 

So my daughter wasn’t really dying-she’d been misdiagnosed. 

They ripped my baby girl’s heart out to save his side piece. 

Cute. Real cute. 

Guess what, boys? Mama’s done crying. 

Hearing that, something inside me shattered. 

This baby wasn’t a love child-it was guilt money. 

Six years playing house with Lucas Morgan while he put on the performance of a lifetime for his precious Lily. 

I touched my stomach and laughed. 

Six years ago I couldn’t save my daughter. Now? I’m done trying to save this mess. 

Back in that office, the doctor sighed. 

“Mr. Morgan, is she really worth all this? Lily’s married. You’ve got a woman at home who worships you. Rebecca’s a catch.” 

Lucas didn’t hesitate. 

“Worth it? I don’t need a ring. I just need her safe. She can love whoever she wants-long as she’s alive and happy, I’m good.” 

“Rebecca? Yeah, she’s great. Perfect wife. Perfect mom. But I don’t love her. Can’t force that.” 

The doctor gave up. “Rebecca’s pregnancy is high-risk. She’s already lost one kid. At least try to be decent this time.” 

Long pause. Then Lucas grunted something vaguely affirmative. 

I bit my lip until I tasted blood, refusing to make a sound. 

The second they left, I broke. 

My baby girl didn’t die from disease-Lucas paid doctors to kill her so Lily could have a fresh heart. 

When my ex bailed to play Romeo with his childhood sweetheart, Lucas showed up playing hero.

I Married My Daughter’s Hero Turns Out I Slent Next to Her KILLED for Six Years 



Turns out he was just babysitting his girlfriend’s stolen organ. 

He married me out of guilt. 

Adorable. 

Outside, the sky opened up. 

I didn’t call a car. Just stumbled through the downpour, mascara probably streaking to my chin. 

When I got home, the housekeeper nearly fainted. 

“Ma’am! You’re pregnant-why didn’t you call the driver?” 

Lucas appeared from his office, coffee in hand. Saw my swollen eyes and soaked hair. For half a second, he almost looked sorry. 

Then he scooped me up. 

“You’re about to be a mother and you’re still acting reckless. What if you’d hurt the baby?” 

I stared at him, dead-eyed. 

“Lucas, I’ve been a mother. Don’t lecture me.” 

“And if this one dies? Whatever. Already lost one.” 

He froze mid-step. Jaw clenched. Said nothing. 

Upstairs, he’d already run me a bath-perfect doting husband routine. 

Reached for my clothes. I shoved his hand away. 

He stared at me. 

We stood there until he finally backed out. 

The second the door shut, I grabbed the soap and scrubbed until my skin burned raw, trying to erase every trace of him. 

Six years of his fingerprints. ",1,1768922699.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

**CLINCHES SINCE THE BYE WEEK:**

Congratulations to u/Chase1738 (ValorX77) and u/HarmonMJ13 on clinching a first round bye! Their performances this season have been head and shoulders above everyone else and the points gap they both enjoy has already locked them into the top 4 seeds!

Valor in particular is at risk of breaking the single-season points record of 181 points, set by TyRoland06 in Season 6. He needs 22 more points to tie. A win for him this week or next will break the record.

Congratulations to u/NASCARJoey (AtlanticCoastJoey) and u/National-King-372 (VolBill99) for mathematically clinching their playoff spots!

**OTHER STUFF:**

If AmazingMrAbsorbency, u/SeaDragon1983, and u/Windows66 (or some other folks in the lower rung of the leaderboard) score well these last two weeks they have the chance of knocking myself or u/Jyingling21 out of the playoffs despite us both winning weeks! *Week winners must finish 15th or better at the end of Week 11 to keep their playoff eligibility!*

SteveFromLatvia is likely to mathematically clinch his playoff spot with a points-paying finish this week. (He might already be clinched using logic (e.g. couldn't be pushed below 12th under any scenario), but my clinches are all mathematical.)

*ANYONE IN 16TH POSITION OR BELOW (u/Unit50079 and below) IS AT RISK OF ELIMINATION UNLESS THEY SCORE POINTS THIS WEEK!*

u/Driley97*,* u/Thrill0728*, AND ANYONE WHO HAS YET TO SCORE POINTS THIS SEASON MUST WIN THIS WEEK TO AVOID ELIMINATION!*

**WEEKS BEGIN ON MONDAYS AT MIDNIGHT EST.**  
**WEEKS END ON FRIDAYS AT NOON EST.**

Week 10 has already begun, it will end on Friday (January 23rd) at Noon EST.

1qi3x61,https://v.redd.it/duhvp0vhuieg1,I made a small Apple Watch app to log food without using my phone,"I wanted to use my Apple Watch more intentionally, so over the last few weeks I built a native, standalone watchOS app called **MacroRings**.

The original problem I had was logging food. Most macro trackers rely on database searches and a phone, which always felt slow and distracting. I was curious whether voice input and on-device AI could make food logging fast enough to do directly from the wrist.

The app lets you tap the watch, say what you ate (for example: “oatmeal with blueberries and a coffee”), and it estimates calories, protein, carbs, and fat using standard serving sizes. The results are visualized using a ring system inspired by Apple’s Activity Rings.

I intentionally designed it for everyday users who want general awareness and accountability rather than perfectly precise, gram-level tracking.

From a technical perspective, the main challenge was making it fully standalone. I wanted everything to work on the watch itself without requiring an iPhone companion app or user accounts.

I mostly built this as a personal experiment, but I’m curious how others think about the idea of diet tracking directly on the watch and whether an extra “Macro Ring” makes sense as a mental model.

I drink coffee every day and usually buy 1kg bags. Over the years I’ve noticed I avoid certain coffees, not because they’re bad, but because they feel a bit harsh or tiring to drink day after day. I don’t really think about acidity or tasting notes . I just know which coffees I don’t want to live with.

So I’m curious:

	•	Do any of you stick to one or two “safe” coffees just to avoid disappointment?

	•	Have you ever reduced cups or stopped experimenting because some coffees feel sharp, acidic, or just too much over time?

	•	Or is this not a thing for most people?

ADVICE NEEDED!! This is long, but please help! I know there are a lot of longer married couples that have lived this and also financially sound individuals that can assist in pointing me in the right direction.

I’ll start by saying I’m completely blown away. Like most couples, we consist of one being a saver and one being a spender. We have a joint account and we also have spending money (SM) accounts, which consists of the $$ each person gets after the budget is done for the month- anywhere from 400-1000 + gas. Being the saver, I usually have $ left towards the end of the month but my husband doesn’t and usually always goes over and sometimes dips back into the main account. Lately I noticed he has been spending more $ (extra coffee, extra clothing, extra food, tons of packages coming in, more than the norm), but has not dipped back into the main acct, which is odd because he’s not a good saver at all so I figured the money had to be coming from somewhere. I assumed it was from a side gig because the rule is whatever side gig money you make is solely yours. Well upon research, he has actually been 1., Direct depositing a small percentage of his salary into his SM acct (whatever- no huge deal) and 2., taking money from his retirement account. I’m talking a lot of money- 7-10k at a time and this has been done 3x within the last 1.5 years with nothing to show for it and that’s the part that pisses me off for a few reasons: We have a 2 credit cards that needs to be paid off (one used to have both our names on it but bc he needed to increase his credit score his name had to be removed from the card…the other is my card but we had a huge move that had to be charged on my card because the move was not covered by the employer, and I’m the only one with a high limit card), a savings goal HE initiated that we’ve not added to, 2 vacations to save for and 2 children in private school because he refuses to have them go to public and a baby. But here he is fu€$ing off money!!!

What advice would you give someone in my shoes?  This feels like “financial cheating” if that’s a thing, & I now feel like I cannot trust him at all when it comes to money. I kind of want to confront him (but I’m not sure that would do anything but make him mad that I’m mad about it (crazy right?!), or start taking and saving/investing more $ on my own and maybe changing beneficiaries around on my and my children’s accounts (life, retirement, savings)… because let’s face it, if something happens to me I can’t help but think he will fu&& off that money, too.

People call me all the time asking about pricing. They want to know why straightening teeth isn't cheaper. They compare prices like they’re shopping for coffee or a new pair of sneakers.

**Here is the truth nobody tells you.**

The cost isn't random. It’s not inflated just because. It is built on real expenses that dictate whether you end up with a Hollywood smile or a ""good enough"" smile that relapses in three years.

Let’s break down exactly what you’re paying for when you look for **affordable braces** or **clear aligners** (and how to spot a rip-off).

***

### 1. You Aren't Paying for ""Glue and Wire""

When you walk into a **top rated orthodontist**, you aren't paying for the materials. You are paying for the outcome.

*   **The Education:** 4 years dental school + 2-3 years residency. That is 7 years of specialized training. A **board certified orthodontist** has even more. You are paying for the knowledge of what *not* to do.
*   **The Experience:** An ortho with 15 years experience knows how to handle complex jaw issues differently than someone fresh out of school. You are paying for speed and safety.
*   **The Tech:** That **free 3D scan** offered at a consult? The machine that does that costs as much as a luxury car. Digital planning software isn't cheap.
*   **The Customization:** No cookie-cutter plans. They look at your specific jaw and goals.

If you are just paying for brackets, go buy some glue at a hardware store (please don’t). You are paying for the **attention**.

### 2. Why Metal vs. Invisalign Prices Differ

I get asked this constantly. Why does **Invisalign cost** more?

*   **Metal Braces:** Brackets are bought in bulk. The cost here is mostly *labor*—the monthly adjustments and chair time.
*   **Clear Aligners:** Every single tray is custom-manufactured for *your* teeth. They aren't sitting on a shelf. Plus, the aligner companies charge the doctor a licensing fee.

Neither is a scam. They just have different cost structures.

### 3. The ""Hidden Costs"" (Read This Before Signing)

When comparing quotes, do not look at the bottom line number yet. Ask what is included.

*   **Retainers:** Are they included? If not, tack on $300-$500.
*   **Breakage:** Do they charge for broken brackets? If you have a teen who chews ice, this matters.
*   **Emergencies:** Are after-hours visits extra?
*   **Refinements:** If you aren't happy at the end, are tweaks included?

A good **orthodontist that explains treatment options** will give you this in writing. If they hide it, run.

### 4. How Insurance *Actually* Works

""I have insurance, it covers 50%!""

**Hold up.**

Most plans have a **lifetime maximum** (usually around $2,000).
*   Treatment cost: $6,000.
*   50% theoretically: $3,000.
*   Real Cap: $2,000.
*   You pay: $4,000.

Always ask specifically about **insurance for braces** and verify the ""lifetime max"" cap.

### 5. The ""Cheap"" Trap

You can find a cheaper option. You can always find someone to do it for less.

But cheap orthodontics often means:
*   Rushed appointments (10 mins vs 30 mins).
*   Older tech (more discomfort, slower movement).
*   **The ""Veneer"" Effect:** They fix the front six teeth but ignore the bite, causing issues later.

I’ve seen people pay double because they had to fix a ""cheap"" job. **It is expensive to start over.**

### 6. The Verdict & Recommendation

If you are price-shopping, look for **value**, not just the lowest number.

Look for:
*   **$0 down payment options** or 0% interest financing.
*   Offices that offer **free 3D scans** (this creates a transparent baseline).
*   **Board certified specialists**.

If you are in **Broward County or Miami Dade County**, I recommend checking out **SMILE-FX Orthodontic and Clear Aligner Studio**.

They check all the boxes:
*   [Board Certified Specialists](https://smile-fx.com/why-smile-fx/board-certified-specialist/) who don't cut corners.
*   Transparent **payment plans** and **insurance coordination**.
*   They handle the full range of cases for [children, teens, and adults](https://smile-fx.com/treatable-cases/).
*   They have solid [patient reviews](https://smile-fx.com/why-smile-fx/patient-reviews/).

Let's be honest, the sticker shock on some coffee machines can be brutal. You want great coffee, maybe even true espresso, but you don't want to take out a second mortgage. That's where smart shoppers like us start looking for value that doesn't compromise on quality or convenience.

This is where a brand like HiBREW really shines. Forget being locked into one type of pod or settling for mediocre hotel room coffee. HiBREW machines offer this incredible ""universal"" advantage. They let you brew using your favorite **K-Cup pods**, **Nespresso capsules**, **Dolce Gusto pods**, or even your preferred **ground coffee**. Talk about pod freedom!

And the coffee? It's not just hot water through a pod. HiBREW machines boast a powerful **19-bar pump** (that's serious espresso territory!) ensuring you get that rich, authentic crema every single time. For those who are always on the go, the H4 series even offers portability with a 12V car adapter – imagine **road trip espresso** or camping mornings that actually taste good.

Here’s the breakdown on why a HiBREW is a smart investment:

*   **Unmatched Versatility:** Brew hot or cold coffee with multiple pod types and ground beans.
*   **True Espresso Quality:** High-pressure extraction delivers rich flavor and crema, not just weak coffee.
*   **Travel-Ready Options:** Take your coffee game anywhere with portable designs.

You get premium features and fantastic coffee quality at a price point that makes sense. It’s time to ditch the limitations and the inflated prices. **Explore the HiBREW collection** today and discover how affordable exceptional coffee can be.",1,1768921995.0,CoffeeTraveler,0,1.0,False
1qi3ny7,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1qi3ny7/looking_to_move_back_to_dc_looking_for/,"Looking to move back to DC, looking for suggestions on where to live.","I lived in DC between 2009 and 2018 and of course absolutely loved it. I bounced around a little for my first couple of years but eventually ended up in Lanier Heights (basically Admo) and had a great time living there. I moved back to NYC in 2018 kind of on a whim, but between the insane cost of living and getting older (I'm 41 now) I've been itching to move back.

My question to the sub is what neighborhoods should I be targeting now? I'd be moving back with my GF and we're looking at a 3br apt or rowhouse, in the ~$6k/mo range. From what I've seen that means I can basically live anywhere, which is a dilemma in itself because I don't want to bounce around again looking for the right fit.

As far as what we're looking for, I'd say walkability is at the top. My GF refuses to drive so having things like coffee shops, groceries, a restaurant or two, yoga studios, and the metro within a few blocks is important. I think access to green space is high on my list, I loved living right behind Rock Creek Park and going on runs and bike rides whenever I wanted. Aside from that nightlife isn't important to us, we're both homebodies at night.

I know DC well, but my knowledge is starting to get pretty dated so I figured it'd be good to ask you all for some thoughts and feedback. What neighborhoods have come up in the past 8 years, which ones have gone to shit?

1qi3nt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1qi3nt3/roommates_drinking_is_turning_our_apartment_into/,Roommate’s drinking is turning our apartment into a nightly roulette and I’m trapped here for now,"I live with “Evan” (30M) and I’m at the point where I dread hearing his key in the door. When we first moved in together he was a normal messy guy, beer in the fridge, whatever. Over the last 4-5 months it’s shifted into something that feels way more serious, and it’s bleeding into every part of living here. He’ll come home saying he only had “a couple,” but he can’t keep a straight line walking to his room. Some nights he’s weepy and wants to sit in the kitchen and do forced heart to hearts about his dad, his ex, how he’s “not a bad person.” Other nights he’s angry at the world and slams cabinets, drops dishes, stomps around like he’s trying to make sure I know he exists. He started “borrowing” my stuff too, but in the dumbest ways. Like he’ll open my pantry and eat half a box of cereal, leave the bag open, spill it, and then swear he didn’t touch it. Or he’ll drink the last of my coffee creamer and replace it with some random flavor he likes, acting like that’s an equal trade. I put a note on my shelf once, not mean, just “please don’t take my groceries” and he sent me this wall of text about how I’m judging him and he “already hates himself enough.” It’s always that, either I’m the bad guy for noticing, or I’m his unpaid therapist because he had a rough day.



The scariest part is the unpredictability. He’ll promise he’s cutting back and then two days later there are bottles in the trash again. Sometimes he forgets he cooked and leaves the stove on low with an empty pan until it starts to smell. I’ve come out in the morning and found the front door not fully shut, like it latched but didn’t lock, and when I asked he shrugged and said, “Dude relax, nothing happened.” He also brings people over late, not even friends I recognize, just random loud energy at midnight, and I’ll hear them laughing in the living room while he tries to play host like everything is fine. Then the next day he acts embarrassed and avoids eye contact, but still doesn’t clean up. I’ve tried talking when he’s sober, like calm conversation, not an ambush. I said I’m worried, and also I need basic safety and respect in the apartment. He got quiet, apologized, and for a week he was great. Then it slid right back, like the “good week” was a coupon that expired.



Before anyone says “just leave,” I can’t right now. Money is tight, my job situation is unstable, and I’m basically locked into this setup for the near future unless I blow up my finances. At the same time I’m not in a position to remove him from the place, and I don’t want this to turn into some big dramatic war. I just need to feel safe in my own home and not constantly wonder what version of him is coming through the door tonight. If you’ve lived with someone who has an alcohol problem, what boundaries actually worked, especially when they swing between guilt, denial, and acting like you’re the cruel one for bringing it up?

1qi3mq1,https://v.redd.it/2dub896uqieg1,"Apple’s Activity Rings were missing a 'Nutrition' ring, so I built it myself. Fully standalone, fast, without subscriptions.","I wanted to utilize my Apple Watch better, so I spent the last few weeks building a **native, standalone watchOS app** called **MacroRings**.

It replaces the database search with Voice and AI. You just tap your wrist, say what you ate, and the AI estimates the macros based on standard serving sizes.

**How it works on the Watch:**

1. **Tap & Speak:** ""Oatmeal with blueberries and a coffee.""
2. **AI Analysis:** The watch processes the request and breaks down Protein, Carbs, Fat, and Calories with 80-95% accuracy. I understand the AI wrappers policy, but simply there isn't second better thing to analyze things like that.
3. **Close Your Rings:** It visualizes your diet just like Activity Rings.

It’s designed for ""normal"" people who want accountability, not necessarily bodybuilders who need 100% gram-perfect precision.

**Why I built it:**

* **True Standalone:** I hated that many ""Watch apps"" are just remote controls for the iPhone. This runs entirely on the wrist. You can avoid phone dependence.
* **Speed:** It takes about 15 seconds to log a meal. 
* **Price:** When usually apps want you to subscribe, my app is $4.99 one-time for lifetime usage.
* **Privacy:** No account creation needed, I don't collect any data. 

I’d love to hear what you think about about the app, and the idea that Apple Watch needs an extra MacroRing to close ;)

1qi3iw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qi3iw5/the_power_of_friendship_part_15/,The power of friendship part 1-5,"Part 1  
Me and my friends have been friends since I can remember.

We live in a row of houses and mine was at the end. Since we were kids, we would always go to one of our friend's houses after school. Our favorite was Mike's house—they had a whole backyard where you can host a party of twenty people.

When we were small, all five of us would hang out at their backyard but Mike's parents would always tell us to be careful and to not go too far because just beyond the yard was the woods. It wasn’t a man‑made woods type where the trees lined up. This place was the old woods—thin trees and large thick trees alternated in places.

We never listened. We would always go through the woods and go to a small stream where we would watch minnows and dragonflies. When it was about to go dark we would always see fireflies in the hundreds. Those woods were beautiful day and night.

When we'd get home Mike's parents would always scold the group telling us it was dangerous and we could get lost. But Mike and my friends would always say that we won’t—because we had me. I’m the wilderness kid of the block. I was familiar with these woods because I go through the woods to get to Mike's place.

Why you might ask? Well my parents were really paranoid. I think my mother got into an accident back in the day when she was trying to cross the road. So mother always tells me:

*""If you are going to your friends, go through the woods. It’s much safer for us.""*

Don’t worry, she did not let me go by my own. Mother and father would always come with me. They would show me pathways and markings so that I would not get lost. But I think I didn’t need it. I was happy when I was walking those woods. It was beautiful in my eyes, soothing even.

So my friends never felt in danger when they were in the woods with me.

I look back on those days with great happiness and sadness too.

  


We’ve all grown up now. Most of our friends are off to different places, living their lives. Even Mike, my best friend, had to leave.

I guess that's just how life goes. I'm the only one left here. I still enjoy the woods. It never lost its beauty in my eyes. But I felt that there was something missing. I think it’s my friends.

  


One day I heard a lot of noise coming from one of our friend's houses. It was Rose's house, her house was at the middle of Mike's and mine. She never had a yard as big as Mike's but they had a pool and a pagoda. We had a lot of picnics there.

So I checked it out. I sneaked a peek to Rose's house and I was shocked. There they were! The old gang is back together. Rose was fidgeting with her phone, trying to find songs. Cedric was grilling. Sammy was swimming and she was calling for a person inside Rose's house. Then I saw him—Mike, Mikeee, Mikester, Mikelangelo, my best friend. He placed a tray of meat by Cedric's side and jumped into the pool with Sammy. When they surfaced, they kissed. Sammy and Mike were together? That’s nice.

Before I realized it I was smiling from ear to ear and I felt it again—the thing that was missing all these years. I knew I was right. It was them. It was always them. It was my friends that made me happy.

  


**Part 2**

But there were new faces too. Two girls and a guy. They seemed part of the crew now.

Inside, everybody was sitting beside someone else in Rose's massive maroon couch. Mike with Sammy. Cedric with the unknown brown‑haired girl. Rose with the unknown guy. And the other unknown girl was sitting behind the couch by herself.

She looked pretty and nice. She had black curly hair. She wore glasses that were too big for her face. She was sitting on a foldable chair, her feet raised, hugging her legs. She looked sad, really sad. She looked like she was daydreaming.

  


The guy said:  
“Anybody want some snacks?”

Rose: “Ooh me, can you get some of the brownies Mike brought.”

Cedric: “Here we goooo let’s start, oh can you get some lemonade so I don’t have to stand up later?”

The brown‑haired girl followed the unknown guy.

Brown‑haired girl: “I’ll get the brownies. Adam, you get lemonade, that shit’s heavy.”

So the guy is Adam huh.

Cedric: “Thanks babe. That’s why I love you.”

Adam: “Oh Cindy can you get my phone, it’s by Rosie’s side.”

Rosie? I thought her dad was the only one who called her Rosie. They must be really close then.

Okay so this is the new gang: Mike, Sammy, Rose, Ced, Adam, and Cindy. New people, new names. I hope I can get along with them. Well if the gang accepted them maybe they’re fine. And if the gang is fine with them, they’ll be fine with me.

But there was an anomaly—the curly‑haired girl. They haven’t mentioned her name the whole time they’ve been there. She’s the only “stranger” to me now.

  


As I was looking at her, still peeking through the window, I heard something coming through the other window—the kitchen’s window.

I crept to the other window and peeked through. I was shocked. Adam and Cindy were making out in the kitchen.

What the fuck are these two doing? Really? In Rose’s house? In her own fucking house?

I felt anger boiling in my veins. These people are new to the crew and they’re already fucking things up. I was about to break the window and shout at them but the curly‑haired girl suddenly screamed.

Curly‑haired girl: “WTF was that!? I saw something on the window. WTF was that!”

She kept screaming.

I hid. Maybe I wasn’t hiding as good as I thought. Or maybe I was? Did she just call me a thing? Rude.

  


Ced and Mike ran from the couch and barged into the kitchen. By this time I was already hidden behind the pagoda. I could still see and hear them but I know they can’t see me. This has been my hiding spot since we were kids. I’m the hide and seek champion of the crew. They haven’t found me once since I found this hiding spot.

Wait, why am I hiding? I should have just stood up and announced myself.

Then I remembered what I was doing peeking on that window. I remembered what I saw. I remembered what Adam and Cindy were doing. I felt my anger again.

I heard Cindy comforting the girl.

Cindy: “Sasha, you okay? What did you see girl? What happened?”

So she’s Sasha. Her name suits her. But not right now—her face was of pure terror. It was like she saw a monster.

I’m ugly I know, but damn. I’m not that ugly. Mother always told me I looked unique and as I grew up I knew what that meant. I’m not attractive. But still, for her to look like this and cry by just seeing me… that hurt a bit.

Sasha: “I don’t know, I don’t know what that was. I just saw something and when I screamed I saw it hide. I’m scared. What the fuck was that.”

Cindy: “Girl, I told you not to take the acid yet. You’ve taken it haven’t you?”

Sasha: “Yes, but it’s just been minutes, it hasn’t kicked in yet.”

Cindy: “Girl, we have been inside for hours. I saw you take it before they went inside.”

Hours? Has it been hours already? Was I watching them from the window for that long? No, that’s not right. Cindy is lying. That lying bitch. She’s messing with Sasha, and she’s been messing with Ced and Rose. I already hate her. Her and this Adam guy.

  


Mike: “Ced, let’s get her inside. You need to sit down Sasha. Let’s calm down a bit.”

Ced: “Mike, I told you to call me Cedric. We’re not kids anymore. Please.”

Mike: “Oh yeah, sorry man. Coming back here, maybe I’m just reminiscing when we were kids. Sorry CED.”

Ced punched his shoulder before they carried Sasha back into the couch. They laid her there and Rose, Sammy, and Cindy sat on the floor as they comforted the crying Sasha.

I was about to leave. Maybe surprising them right now might not be a good idea. Don’t want to give Sasha another fright. The poor girl might get a heart attack.

  


**Part 3**

As I was standing up, I saw Ced and Mike walk out of the house to the edge of the pool.

It’s the boys! Maybe I can still surprise them. If it’s only the boys they won’t make a fuss.

They pulled out cigarettes. They smoke now? Even Ced? Never in a million years would I think that Ced would become a smoker.

He hated the smell of cigarettes. His dad was a smoker. His dad was not a good man. He hurt Ced.

Ced’s house was nearest to mine. So when I was bored I would always go to see Ced and we would go to Mike's house to hang out. I would always see bruises on Ced's arms and legs. Some days I would see him with a bloody nose. Sometimes he couldn’t keep up with me when we were going through the woods. He thought I didn’t notice, but I saw. He was limping.

I don’t know what that evil man did to him and I could not think about it. Thinking about it makes me want to cry and Ced would not want that. He never wanted us to pity him. He wanted us to see how strong he was. How strong his will was. And I liked that about Ced. He was a strong boy. I only hope that he became a strong man after all these years.

Before I knew it, a tear fell down my cheeks. I was crying. Their cigarettes were already almost gone. Perfect time to say hello.

  


Then he spoke. Ced spoke.

Ced: “I’m sorry man, didn’t mean to be rude. Being back here makes me feel agitated. I remember all those fucking days.”

Mike: “I know man, I’m sorry. Hey if you want me to call you anything I’ll do it. Want me to call you Cedric, that’s fine. I’ll even call you Gaylord if you want, Donald? Mickey? Bond? James Bond? Anything man, just say it.”

Classic Mike. Never letting a sad moment get in the way of a joke. Even if the joke is a bit offending. Well, that’s why we’re friends. That’s why we’re a crew. We understood each other. That’s what made us strong. What made our friendship strong.

I made up my mind. I’ll hop out. I’ll say *wazzzaaaa* and this sad mood will be blown away.

But before I even get the chance, Adam walks out. This guy again. Gods, am I the unluckiest person in the world?

Adam walked out, hugged and lifted Mike and Ced for a second then dropped them.

Adam: “My boys, what are you doing out here having some bro time without me? We’re the trio remember? And you’re smoking without me? You’re making me sad.”

Mike: “Sorry Mr. Sandler. Me and Cedric—I mean James Bond here—were just reminiscing about the time when our lives haven’t been ruined by you yet.”

Both Ced and Mike laughed.

Adam: “Now that hurts. You know I’m not related to the great comedian Adam Sandler.”

Ced: “That’s what hurt you? Not that me and Mike were remembering the times when you weren’t part of the crew yet? You’re crazy Mr. Sandler. All that money from your unfunny movies have gotten to your head. It’s made you crazy like your films.”

Adam: “HAHAHA. I see why Cindy and Sammy like you guys. And I see where Rosie got her sense of humor.”

He then hugged and picked them both up again and carried them back into the house.

Adam: “C’mon boys, Rosie just brought the bong out. It’s about to get lit up in this carpet mansion.”

Bong? What’s a bong? And that Adam guy is pretty strong. Bet I’m stronger. I bet I can pick them up—all three of them at the same time.

Fucking Adam. Talking about trio this, trio that. I was part of the trio and we never had a trio. We were the crew. All five of us. Not a trio.

Mike, Ced, Rose, Sammy, and me. Not a trio.

  


Then I found myself sitting there, in the woods, sad. Sitting on the leaf litter, fireflies flying around me.

Have I been replaced? Have they forgotten about me?

But… but I stayed here. I was the only part of the crew who stayed. I kept the places where we hung out clean. I made them better. So when anyone of you returned we could hang out again. I waited.

Now I’m replaced.

I sat there until night, until morning. I didn’t even realize it was morning already.

  


**Part 4**

I was only kicked out of my stupor when I heard the door of the house open. It was Rose. She had a mug of coffee in her hand and she was wearing a robe. Adam followed her out. He hugged her from behind.

Adam: “Last night was great babe, you felt so vulnerable. I liked it. Maybe we should do it more often at your childhood room.”

He laughed, a fucking annoying laugh.

Rose: “Yeah it was weird, I’ve never felt like that before. We’ve done it so many times before but I’ve never felt like that ever.”

Adam: “Maybe it’s because you’ve never orgasmed 3 times in a row until now? You can thank me later. Maybe tonight? Preferably in your childhood room again?”

He laughed again. I’ve never been more annoyed at a person’s laugh like I’m annoyed at this guy’s snorting laughter right now.

Rose: “Maybe you’ll get lucky tonight. But you left me there after. I wanted to cuddle after. I wanted to fall asleep beside you. Where did you even go?”

Adam: “Oh after we showered and you went back to the room, me and the boys went out to smoke by the pool and I fell asleep at the couch after. I was blasted. I don’t know how those two got to their rooms. I doubt they will even remember we smoked.”

This fucking liar. I was out here all night. I never heard anyone go out all night, let alone all three of them. He probably snuck out and met with Cindy to make out again. What a total rat.

  


Adam suddenly spoke, he sounded serious.

Adam: “Hey babe, what happened to Cedric here? He flipped out on Mike when Mike called him Ced. Did something happen when you guys were kids?”

Rose: “Oh, I haven’t told you his story? Well, to be honest we swore never to tell anyone about Ced’s story.”

Adam: “Cedric. We don’t want him flipping out on us now.”

Rose: “Oh yeah, Cedric. Well I have to call him Ced to tell you his story.”

Adam: “Why?”

Rose: “Because only we called him Ced when we were kids. We called our group ‘the crew.’ To be exact his mom called us the crew, and she called him Ced too. That’s where we got his name.”

Rose: “When we were kids, Ced was the outsider shy child. We would always see him peeking out his window when me, Mike and Sammy played outside. He would just watch us play. One day we summoned up the courage to knock on his front door. His mom opened the door and she immediately called Ced: ‘Ced honey, your friends are here!’ She was so nice. She didn’t even know us but she already knew what we came there for.”

  


Rose: “Before Cedric got down, his mom told us: ‘Hey guys, Ced has a few bruises so be careful okay? He’s a clumsy child so take care of him. But don’t tell him I told you that. He’s a strong‑willed boy.’ We had not known then why he really had bruises. We thought he was just a clumsy child just like his mom said.”

Rose: “Ced got down, peeked in the living room. Then we heard a loud voice: ‘The fuck do you want boy? Spit it out.’

Cedric whispered: ‘Can I go out with my friends sir?’

Cedric’s dad: ‘Speak up Cedric, I told you to speak louder. Stop being lousy.’

Cedric: ‘Can I go out with my friends sir!’

Cedric’s dad: ‘To do what Cedric? Finish your sentences. Jesus Christ boy, are you slow? Do I need to do something about that again?’

Cedric’s mom: ‘Darling, there are kids here. They can hear you.’

Cedric’s dad: ‘I don’t fucking care about those kids bitch. Don’t butt in when I’m talking with my child.’

Cedric’s mom carried him outside and closed the door. Then she told us: ‘Don’t worry about Ced’s dad, he’s just a bit crazy from work. He’s just tired. Go ahead Ced, go play with your friends. Don’t worry about your dad.’”

  


Rose suddenly teared up and grabbed her mug tighter.

Adam: “You okay babe? What happened?”

Rose: “Yeah, it’s just… we were so oblivious back then. We never even realized what was going on. I was so dumb. We were so dumb. We could have helped him. We could have helped his mom.”

Adam: “Rosie, you guys were children. Babe it wasn’t your fault. Did he hurt Cedric and his mom?”

Rose: “Yeah, he hurt Cedric. But he hurt Cedric’s mom even worse. The first time we hung out Cedric was agitated the whole time. He kept zoning out. But he kept saying he was fine. Now I know why he was feeling like that. As we were playing his dad was hurting his mom.”

  


Adam: “Jesus.”

Rose: “When we got back, Mike knocked on the door before Cedric could stop him. Before Cedric could pull Mike back, the door opened and hit Mike at the shoulder.

Cedric’s dad: ‘The fuck do you want? Oh it’s the rats. Woman, Cedric’s back. Clean him up before we have dinner.’

Cedric’s mom: ‘Hi kids, did you have fun?’

She had a black eye and she was wiping blood off her nose. She was hurt, but her first instinct was to check up on Mike, to look if he was hurt. She was such a nice lady.”

  


Adam: “By the way, where are his parents now? I feel like I want to visit his mom and treat her to whatever she likes. That woman deserves it I think.”

Rose: “Oh babe, well I think she’s with her sister now if I remember Cedric told me way back. She and Ced left the house after his dad died.”

Adam: “Serves him right. She can live peacefully now.”

Rose: “Yeah, she finally got free from him.”

  


Cindy peeked out the door and shouted.

Cindy: “Bab… Rose! Rose, let’s pack up girl. Mike said we need to pack our things for the camping trip. He said you’ll understand.”

Rose: “Kay, I’ll be there in a few. Tell Sammy don’t take my bug repellent! Thanks sis.”

Adam: “We’re packing up? This early? Isn’t it supposed to be a night camp?”

Rose: “Yeah well the route to the campsite is a bit tricky if we go at night. So we hike by day, so we get there before it gets dark.”

Adam: “Oh okay. You go on ahead. I need to smoke. I don’t really have a lot of things so I got some time.”

Camping? They’re going camping? Are they going to our old campsite? They’re hiking so most likely they are. Heck yeah. If I go quick I’ll have enough time to clean up before they arrive. It will be just like old times.

  


**Part 5**

At Mike and Sammy’s room.

Sammy: “Hey, who left?”

Mike: “I think Cedric, Rose, and Sasha.”

Sammy: “Cindy and Adam still here?”

Mike: “Shit, yeah. I didn’t realize.”

Sammy: “Jesus Mike, I told you never to leave those two alone. This has to stop.”

Mike: “I know, I know, I forgot. We should tell them.”

Sammy: “Jesus Mike really? Here? Right now? Are we really gonna add to the trauma this place has on Ced and Rose?”

Mike: “Cedric.”

Sammy: “What? Oh yeah Cedric. So when do we tell them?”

Mike: “Let’s just get this camp done. I’ll tell Cedric when we get back. You tell Rose.”

Sammy: “No, let’s do it together. We owe them this much. We’re their oldest friends. It has to be us together. Us four.”

Mike: “Want me to separate the two? I’ll ask Adam to go out on a walk until the rest get here.”

Sammy: “As much as I want you to stay here, I really don’t like leaving those two together. My conscience can’t take it.”

Mike: “Alright, but you owe me one.”

Sammy: “Yeah yeah, I’ll give you a surprise at camp.”

Mike: “That’s what I like about you, Princess Sammy.”

  


Mike: “Adam? Going out for a smoke, wanna come? I’ll show you our hottest English teacher’s house from grade school.”

Adam: “Bit busy bro.”

Mike: “Where are you?”

Adam: “You go ahead, I’ll go later.”

Mike: “Dude, you’re not from here, how will you find me? C’mon I insist.”

Adam: “Damn it Mike. Okay give me a minute. I’ll meet you out front.”

After 10 minutes.

Mike: “You ready? Where were you?”

Adam: “I was in the bathroom, massive shit. This hot teacher better be worth it man.”

Mike: “Ohh she’s hot, if she’s still alive. She’ll be pushing 70 by now. I know you like your cougars.”

Adam: “Cougar? Dude that’s a saber tooth. She’s 70? She’s from the ice age.”

Mike: “Hehe c’mon let’s go. I’ll show you around.”

  


It’s getting dark. Where are they? I hope they still remember the path. They haven’t been here in so long, they might get lost.

Maybe they already got lost. Shit shit. What do I do? Do I wait? God they might get into trouble out here. Do I go back? I might see them at the trail. But what if they got lost away from the trail?

I should go home and ask mother for help. No, father might still be at home. He’ll get angry if he hears the guys are lost at night. He always told me not to let them go at night. But father would be my best hope if I want to find them if they’re lost.

But father might not even help and he would also tell mother not to help. No. No. I have to do this. I know these woods. I have to be strong. I have to. I know these woods. I’ll find them.

  


As I ran through the woods, I kept close to the trail trying to find any clue on what happened to my friends. I could never forgive myself if after all these years that I have waited for them to return I then let them get lost.

No. That won’t happen. That can’t happen. I won’t let that happen.

I ran through the trail until I got to Mike’s house. No sign. No sign of my friends.

Maybe I missed something? Wait, were they really coming here? They never said they were coming here. They just said they were camping. It was me. I was the one who assumed they were coming to our campsite.

Am I stupid? Did I make a mistake? Have… have they really forgotten me? Have they forgotten about our lives here?",2,1768921659.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

i grew up mormon too but none of the 6 kids in my family are in anymore and my parents dropped the rope easily. they've moved on and we even bring wine to thanksgiving at their house. but all 4 of my husband's siblings are returned missionaries (even sister missionaries back when you were supposedly ugly for not being married at 21), most are BYU grads/fans, and all bending over backflips to excuse & soothe emotionally abusive narcissistic MIL. she's been such a bully to me (and one of her kids) in so many ways! it was only last week i insisted my husband have me removed from the multiple daily group text thread. every mormon update like missionary age changes or the anniversary of the family proclamation being sung with high praise & everyone bearing testimonies...

plus MIL texting things like ""it's 9pm dad is still at work and i'm home alone"" in her 50s. she insists on being called momma \_\_hername\_\_ as a grandma because she's never had an identity outside of running i mean ruining the lives of her children i mean raising them. funny enough, we moved out of UT recently for my husband's job and his new boss is a mormon man (the chances!) with 5 kids, who works unnecessarily late into the evening and night daily. hey juuuust like my FIL, is it a mormon man workism morality thing or a dislike their wife/home life thing. i wonder.

not to mention the group text spam of photos from every angle of MIL's new porsche (she's never been employed and this is a 'company car' for FIL's business) + the electric bmw they're ""selling"" (oh i'm sure) to SIL so she can have more kids with the second row of seats, literally that's what was said.

omg and they're all saying it's blessings! they're so blessed.

when 15years ago the inlaws wouldn't even fork out 2500 for their part of a wedding reception where they'd have 90% of the guest list as their ward. in protest and punishment of our heathen vows probably. no blessings for us! MIL and FIL threw a tantrum when we got engaged & planned to move in together so much that they forced a courthouse wedding my parents couldn't attend. my parents are poor and not from UT lol vs ILs have an elevator in their mansion (with no one disabled necessitating this). sigh, don't get married at 21 kids. i love my husband but we should've had fully cooked brains- i shouldn't have put up with the bad kid in trouble treatment. and as we left the courthouse MIL said, ""you know this isn't forever right, only until death"" a threat perhaps.

TBM family gets together monthly + for every minor and major holiday, cosplaying a close family when in reality everyone sits in silence crashed out from their soda and energy drinks. right because when i showed up with a coffee once, MIL took my husband aside to hiss about me being a bad influence. nobody actually has common interests or hobbies at all aside from the mormon church, let alone shows interest in each other outside of their church callings. unless of course MIL is commenting negatively on someone's appearance or my parenting and lifestyle. the family obligation to my MIL and her whims reeks of a codependent enmeshed family system but they love to act like it's a family ordained by god type thing.",12,1768921405.0,exmormon,6,0.94,False

1qi3cls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1qi3cls/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"This is my second GD pregnancy. In my first pregnancy, I was diagnosed after failing one hour test around 26/27 weeks. I was diet controlled until the last \~2 weeks when I went on very low doses of fasting and breakfast insulin.

This time around, I was diagnosed much earlier, right around 12 weeks. I’m 19 weeks now. I’ve had some spikes here and there, but I’d say generally most numbers are in range. My worst spike was Christmas Day when I decided to have a kale bowl (from playa bowls, if you don’t know it’s a kale base with granola, fruit, etc.) and a sweet coffee. I spiked to 230!!! But that’s a big outlier and if I spike now it’s typically 150’s - my doctors have me check one hour post meals so limit is 140.

If I eat something risky, I typically briskly walk my dog for 10-15 minutes and that helps. However, I recently discovered that the elliptical is far more effective in getting my sugar to not spike. I can do 5 minutes on it post riskier meals and test in ranges. Examples are half of a scooped bagel (with tons of cream cheese, veggies and cheese lol) or lasagna. 

Well yesterday I really wanted frozen yogurt - like from a self serve place, where you fill up your own cup. I decided if I got a good dinner number around 7:30, I would eat the yogurt around 8:30 then hit the elliptical for 15 minutes. Intentionally planned to have my typical bedtime snack (core power protein shake either alone or mixed with some Fairlife chocolate milk) after I checked the yogurt result.

The yogurt is 6g of carbs per ounce. I filled up the full cup nearly and topped it with blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, chocolate chips and even a few mochi pieces, which are pure sugar. I even added some Nutella! No idea how many carbs it totaled but a lot like probably 75g or more. And lots of sugar. After eating did the elliptical for 15 minutes at around 9ish. 

I was expecting to spike a little bit but expected it to be 165-185ish and was hoping to not go over 200. Well my one hour level was 137!!!!! Might have been closer to 70 minutes post eating but still I was shocked! Had some core power and my fasting this morning was 96, which is pretty normal for me lately. 

Do you guys eat whatever you want if you’re able to get sugar in range with exercise? I’m shocked at how effective it was given what I ate last night. In my first pregnancy, I don’t remember exercise being nearly as helpful for risky meals but it was much later on and I was only walking/doing stationary bike really.

So I guess I want to know if I can continue to live a little dangerously here and there if I hit the elliptical after? Is it just the number that matters?

I’m really tempted to try the kale bowl again (without the sweet coffee) and use the elliptical and see what happens!!!

Any thoughts or suggestions are super appreciated!

We’ll be staying in the Kensington / Olympia area.  
**Monday (Arrival Day): - Airbnb Public transport** 5–7 minute walk Overground and rail connections

* flight lands at **7:20am** (BOOKED AN OVERNIGHT FLIGHT SO WE WILL GET ""SOME"" REST)
* early check-in, refreshen up & breakfast near the Airbnb
* head toward Buckingham Palace area- if on time to see the changing of guard.
* walk around the royal area: Buckingham Palace, The Mall, St James’s Park, Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall
* continue on to Westminster Abbey (outside), Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, Westminster Bridge
* maybe walk along the Thames and see the London Eye from the outside
* dinner somewhere near head back EARLY to rest

I’m intentionally keeping this day mostly walking and outdoors because of jet lag. Does this seem reasonable for an arrival day or still too much?

**Tuesday:**

* **Tower of London (inside)** with a **9:00am** entry (Crown Jewels, Beefeaters, etc.)
* lunch near the Tower or Borough Market
* Tower Bridge
* **Leadenhall Market** (Harry Potter filming location)
* Millennium Bridge
* St Paul’s Cathedral (outside only)
* dinner nearby

Does this day flow well location-wise?

**Wednesday:**

* walk from Airbnb to **Kensington Palace** for a **10:00am** entry
* explore Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park after
* light lunch / coffee nearby
* **Afternoon Tea at The Ritz** around **3:30pm**
* possibly a West End show in the evening (thinking Phantom of the Opera, but still deciding)

**Thursday:**

* **Warner Bros. Studio Tour – Harry Potter** with a **10:00am** entry
* planning to treat this as a full day since I’ve heard it’s pretty long
* casual dinner afterward and an easy night

**Friday (Departure Day):**

* morning not planned as of yet
* head back to pick up luggage and leave for the airport (flight at **5:25pm**)

**EDIT:** My husband and I have traveled a lot internationally and tend to have a pretty fast-paced travel style. We’re very organized and realistic about what we can handle.

1qi33a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1qi33a9/the_psychology_of_disgustingly_attractive/,"The Psychology of ""Disgustingly Attractive"" Communication That Works on Women (Even for Introverts)","Spent way too much time studying this stuff. Books, research papers, psychology podcasts, dating coaches on YouTube. Not gonna lie, I was terrible at talking to women. Like genuinely awful. Would freeze up, say weird shit, or just avoid eye contact entirely.

Here's what nobody tells you: most ""dating advice"" is written by extroverts for extroverts. They tell you to ""just be confident"" or ""approach 100 women."" That's like telling someone with a broken leg to ""just walk it off.""

The good news? Introverts have built-in advantages that extroverts don't. You just gotta learn how to use them. After digging through actual psychological research and testing this stuff IRL, I found patterns that actually work. Not pickup artist BS. Real communication principles backed by behavioral science.

## 1. Master the ""Strategic Pause"" Technique

Most guys think they need to fill every silence. Wrong. Dr. John Gottman's research (the guy who can predict divorce with 94% accuracy) found that comfortable silence actually builds intimacy. Women interpret it as confidence and emotional regulation.

Here's the move: when she finishes talking, count 2 seconds before responding. Sounds weird but it does three things simultaneously. Shows you're actually processing what she said (not just waiting for your turn to talk). Creates tension that makes your words carry more weight. Demonstrates emotional control which reads as maturity.

I learned this from ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer, former FBI behavioral analyst. Insanely good read about influence and rapport building. He literally interrogated spies for a living and breaks down how to make people want to talk to you. The book won't teach you pickup lines, it teaches you how human connection actually functions at a psychological level.

## 2. Use the ""Curiosity Loop"" Framework

Women lose interest when you're predictable. Simple as that. The solution isn't being mysterious or playing games, it's structuring conversations to create natural curiosity gaps.

Here's how it works: mention something interesting but don't fully explain it. ""Oh man, that reminds me of this wild thing that happened in Tokyo"" then immediately ask her a question before elaborating. She'll remember that dangling thread and ask you about it later. Boom, built-in conversation callback.

This works because of something called the ""Zeigarnik effect"" where our brains obsess over incomplete information. It's why cliffhangers work in TV shows.

Pair this with the ""lighthouse technique"" I picked up from Charisma on Command YouTube channel (one of the best channels for social skills, period). Instead of constantly seeking her attention (needy), you occasionally give her your full focus then naturally shift attention elsewhere. Creates a push-pull dynamic that's weirdly magnetic.

## 3. Weaponize Your Listening Skills

Introverts naturally listen better than extroverts. But most waste this superpower by just passively nodding. You need to demonstrate that you're listening in ways she can feel.

Use the ""echo and elevate"" method: repeat back the emotional core of what she said, then ask a deeper question. She says ""work was so stressing today, my boss is driving me crazy."" You respond ""sounds like you're feeling undervalued there. What would need to change for you to actually enjoy going in?""

This creates what psychologists call ""felt understanding"" which is the foundation of attraction. It's not about agreeing with everything, it's about making someone feel genuinely seen.

Dr. Sue Johnson's work on attachment theory (she developed emotionally focused therapy) shows that feeling understood activates the same brain regions as physical touch. Her book ""Hold Me Tight"" is technically about long term relationships but the communication principles apply to initial attraction too. This is the best relationship psychology book I've ever read. Will make you question everything you think about connection.

## 4. Control the Frame with ""Assumption Statements""

Here's a counterintuitive one: making assumptions (the right way) builds attraction faster than asking questions. Instead of ""what do you like to do for fun?"" try ""you seem like someone who does something creative on weekends.""

Even if you're wrong, you've demonstrated observation skills and confidence. If you're right, you seem perceptive. Either way, it's more engaging than another boring interview question.

This comes from improv comedy principles. Say ""yes and"" to conversation rather than interrogating. Builds collaborative energy instead of transactional energy.

## 5. Leverage ""Strategic Vulnerability""

Vulnerability isn't weakness, it's selective authenticity. Share something personal but not traumatic. Something that shows self-awareness without being a therapy session.

Research from Brené Brown (connection researcher at University of Houston) shows that appropriate vulnerability triggers reciprocal vulnerability. Creates fast intimacy. The key word is ""appropriate."" Don't trauma dump on a first conversation.

Good vulnerability: ""I'm trying to get better at putting myself out there socially. It's not natural for me but I'm working on it."" Bad vulnerability: ""my ex destroyed my ability to trust anyone.""

Her book ""Daring Greatly"" breaks down the science of vulnerability and shame. Insanely good for understanding why connection feels risky and how to do it anyway.

## 6. Practice ""Conversation Threading""

This is a game changer for keeping conversations flowing naturally. Most people ask question, get answer, ask unrelated question, get answer. Feels like an interview.

Instead, pull multiple threads from her responses and weave them together. She mentions she went to a concert last weekend. You can thread into: music taste, live shows, weekend routines, who she went with, the venue, the city it was in. Six different conversation branches from one answer.

""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane has phenomenal frameworks for this. She coaches executives at Stanford and breaks down charisma into learnable behaviors. The book will make you realize charisma isn't some genetic gift, it's specific communication patterns you can practice.

If you want to take this even further, there's an AI-powered learning app called Be Freed that's been super helpful for internalizing these concepts. It pulls from relationship psychology research, dating expert insights, and behavioral science books to create personalized audio learning plans. You can customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples.

What makes it different is the adaptive learning plan feature. You tell it your specific goal, like ""become more confident in dating as an introvert,"" and it builds a structured plan pulling from sources like attachment theory research, communication studies, and books like the ones mentioned here. The app has this virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about your unique struggles, and it recommends content based on that. Way more efficient than reading dozens of books cover to cover when you just want actionable communication strategies.

## 7. Master the ""Investment Gradient""

Big mistake guys make: going from 0 to 100 on investment. Asking for her number 5 minutes in. Suggesting plans before any rapport exists.

Instead, gradually increase investment on both sides. Start with low stakes: ""I'm grabbing coffee, want anything?"" Then slightly bigger: ""there's this taco spot around the corner that's criminally underrated."" Then actual plans: ""we should check out that art exhibit you mentioned.""

Each step requires slightly more commitment from both people. Feels natural instead of forced. You're also gauging her interest level through her willingness to match your investment.

## 8. Use ""Reframing"" to Bypass Insecurities

Your introversion isn't a bug, it's a feature. But you gotta frame it correctly. Don't apologize for being quiet or shy. Instead, position it as selective with your energy.

""I'm pretty intentional about who I spend time with"" sounds way better than ""sorry I'm awkward."" Same trait, different frame. One communicates standards, the other communicates insecurity.

Mark Manson's ""Models"" is hands down the best dating book for introverted men. No manipulation tactics. Just honest communication and developing genuine confidence. He basically argues that neediness is the root of all dating problems and shows how to fix it.

## 9. Develop ""Outcome Independence""

This is the meta skill that makes everything else work. When you genuinely don't need a specific outcome from an interaction, you relax. When you relax, you're more attractive. Paradoxical but true.

Practical application: before talking to someone you're interested in, decide that you're just going to enjoy the conversation regardless of where it goes. Not as a mental trick, but as genuine reframing. You're exploring whether you like her, not just whether she likes you.

This removes the desperate energy that kills attraction faster than anything else. Women can smell neediness from across a room.

## 10. Practice ""Calibrated Directness""

Don't hide your interest, but don't lead with it either. There's a sweet spot between playing games and being too available.

If you're interested, make it clear through behavior (asking questions, maintaining eye contact, suggesting future plans) but don't explicitly state it too early. Creates productive tension. She knows, you know she knows, but nobody's said it out loud yet.

When you do express interest, be specific. Not ""I think you're cool"" but ""I really enjoy how you think about things differently than most people."" Specific compliments about non physical traits hit different.

Look, none of this is magic. It won't turn you into some smooth talking Casanova overnight. But these are actual psychological principles that leverage your natural strengths as an introvert. You don't need to become someone else. You just need to communicate who you already are more effectively.

Biggest thing I learned? Women aren't a different species. They're just people who respond to the same psychological principles as everyone else. Genuine interest, emotional intelligence, confidence without arrogance. Master those and you're already ahead of 90% of guys out there.

Im in Osaka thinking of moving to Tokyo. (resident btw😅)

So apparently the only way to meet people to date here is if you work with them or school. If you dont have those associations, then it’s straight to apps?

Anyways I started talking with a girl off bumble. The vibe has been there so I asked her on a date. She recommended we go to a famous shrine, and I told her we should start simple with coffee. (it would be awkward to commit to something like a shrine with a stranger for almost a whole day lol)

She said “Yes you choose the time” since she decides her work schedule. 

I said “how about this friday?” (in 3 days)

Then she said “I’ll be in Tokyo on Thursday, and after that I’ll be a bit busy😭How about a weekday in February?”

(thats over two weeks from now😳) 

I really dont know Japan well yet, but in USA ive never planned a first date more than a few days into the future without it completely losing momentum and falling through. Is this normal in japan?? Or is she doing the *slow-fade away as* i suspect? scheduling our first date 2-3 weeks from now is crazy work IMO😂

Also, why doesnt anyone show their face on tinder? Like how am i supposed to swipe right on them like its blind dating? Lmao what a joke.. genuinely curious too

2. Snorkeling equipment- we will be bringing our own head gear for sure but what about the flippers? We have some but they are more for scuba so long and therefore takes up a lot of space so wondering if the stuff on site is alright or not. What time does the rental area for equipment open?
3. Theme nights- I love a good theme! I have heard the country night is good even if you don’t like country lol so we will see but what other nights are worth checking out? Do people dress to the theme?
4. Destination stickers- think the normally black and white ovals with the shortened letters for a place. I know runners have something similar with how long they have ran. big fan of these and I know at other resorts they offer them at the gift shops.

27^(th) of Arah – Continued

As the three heroes descended the steps into the previously unknown basement, they found themselves more than a little surprised by the cleanliness of the passage. No cobwebs, dust, or mold lingered in the air, let alone on the stairs themselves. As they descended some thirty or more feet, they could hear a crackling sound in the distance, and the air held a vague hint of ozone.

Hesh cocked their head to one side, took a deep sniff of the air, and commented, “I smell ozone, and that crackling sound sounds like a Van de Graaff generator, or a Tesla coil going off. What have we found here?”

Sam frowned, “Some kind of mad scientist type?”

“Or just a crazy mage, with too much lightning on his mind.” Molly added.

“Maybe we should call him Sparky?” Hesh asked.

Molly and Sam glanced at Hesh for a moment, before saying, “Hesh? Shut up.”

At the bottom of the steps the trio were met by an old, grizzled, pie-bald cat. It looked up at them from where it was sitting on top of an old crate, did the cat equivalent of rolling its eyes, and went back to cleaning itself. In response, Molly reached out and scratched the cat behind its ears, momentarily enjoying the soft fur under her fingers, before turning away and glaring at the other two, “What? It’s a cat. You must scratch the cat.” Then she began walking down the corridor.

The not so long darkened corridor did indeed lead to what can be best described as a mad scientist’s lab from the ‘60s era of sci-fi films. Bubbling beakers, strange boxes arching lightning up and down antennae, a metal lab table under a surgery wards positional light. Along one wall sat a long bank of possibly metal cabinets with green, amber and red blinking lights.

The real selling point was the dark-haired man standing in the middle of the room, wearing a white lab coat, and looking at a clipboard. As they approached the doorway, he looked up from the board, smiled, and said, “Welcome to the vampire mansion!”

\-

The trio sat at a long table of polished oak, with cups of tea on proper saucers before them, and stared at the man across the table from them. The man stood, in a frilly pink apron, and placed several plates of what he had called “confections” on the table for them to taste. “And now that that is done, it is time for proper introductions!” The man said.

“I am doctor Franklin Windershins of New York. I know, it sounds like a made-up name- “

“We know the name. The Big Apple.” Hesh said. “We’re from down south.”

“…” Franklin looked at them. “Did…did you come through the gateway I made? How did you find it? How was the reactor doing?”

“No.” Sam replied. “We were summoned by a trio of gods.”

“Gods?” Franklin asked.

“Big glowing people?” Molly more said than asked. “Huge amounts of power? Not as smart as they like to think they are?”

“So more like the Greek or Roman gods, as opposed to our God?” Franklin asked.

“Pretty much.” Sam answered. “Although Hesh here is agnostic, not Christian.”

Franklin raised an eyebrow, then shook his head. “So, what brings you children to this neck of the woods?”

“Vampires.” Molly replied. “Specifically, you being a vampire.”

“Oh, dear lord, is the headman still raging about that joke?” Franklin shook his head. “It was Halloween! I was in a costume! I explained it to him!”

A sigh escaped the trio, as they shook their heads. Molly began giggling, then the other two began laughing. Eventually Franklin joined them.

\-

“So, you are trying to recreate the experiment that brought you here, in order to make it back home.” Hesh, also wearing a lab coat, said.

“Exactly my good…person?”

Hesh smiled, “That works.”

“My attempts at recreating the reactor have failed, so taking a page, almost literally from Shelly, I have turned to lightning. But with no way to store enough energy from the strikes, I have been unable to maintain a gate for more than a half second.”

“Why haven’t you turned to magic?” Molly asked, now dressed in a matching lab coat to Hesh’s.

“Because there is no standardization with which to use the scientific method.” Franklin began to explain. “One mages lightning bolt is several watts and volts different from another’s, even if they learned the spell from the same teacher. Also, even a ring or stone of spell storing doesn’t release the spell over a long enough time frame for the gate to stabilize. Not to mention that there isn’t enough energy to maintain the gate once it has opened.”

“You have had mages in to try?” Hesh asked.

Franklin nodded, “Of course! How else would I know?”

Sam frowned, “So you need a generator, or a deep cell battery bank, to maintain the power for long enough so that the gate stays open for a useable amount of time.”

Franklin kept nodding, “Exactly!”

Molly frowned, “I’ve been meaning to ask, why does your lab look like it came out of a 50’s sci-fi film?”

“Because it’s 1958.”

In the silence that followed, the trio looked at each other and frowned. Hesh finally broke the silence, “When we are from, it’s the 2020’s.”

\-

Sever hours, a roasted ham, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a thick crusty loaf of bread later the four people sat around the large dining room table conversing.

Franklin, once again in the frilly apron, asked what to him was an important question, “So the movie actor became president?”

“Yes, Reagan became president, after being the governor of California.” Hesh answered for the third time.

“Apologies Hesh, it’s just that surprising to me.” Franklin said with a slight bow. “I met the man once; he was half blind. Could barely see past his nose without glasses.” He smiled. “Now on to different things.”

Eventually Franklin showed the trio to a pair of spare rooms, to spend the night.

The morning came with the smell of fresh coffee, bacon, eggs frying on a griddle, and freshly toasted bread. After its consumption, the conversation turned to ways to use magic as a constant power source. Lunch came and went, and the conversation continued, with chalkboards. Eventually, after a dinner of thick mutton stew with an extra crusty garlic bread, the exhausted party slept.

Another morning of breakfast finished, the group of four scientific mages began work on a grand machine. A grand machine that would convert the energy of the constant lightning storm above to mana that would be stored in a combination mana battery/capacitor; this design and construction was delegated to Hesh. The henceforth called MBC would then be hooked to the Gate Control Unit, GCU, to refine the power, and operate the gate itself; Franklin, Sam and Molly assigned themselves to this project. The gate itself was already present, and didn’t need any more work.

\-

Four days passed. Four days of random lightning strikes within and without the laboratory. Four days of good food, and surprisingly good company. Four days that came to an end too soon for all involved.

The MBC and GCU were completed, and assembled in a breadboard fashion. Thick mana-electric cables were affixed between the units and the gate. A set of large switches separated the three units.

Standing together, the three heroes watched Franklin flip the first switch, connecting the lightning rod to the MBC. Several lightning strikes later, the red, amber, and green lights attached to it blazed. At the success, all involved hooted and hollered.

Then the second switch that ran between the MBC and GCU was flipped. After a few small sparks, the red, amber and green lights brightened, and the gauge designated “Power Flow Stability” evened out. The big red button on top of the board, labeled “GO!” lit.

The third switch was thrown. The gate lit with a soft white light, and gave a slight hum, as the dozens of small capacitors warmed up and came to a full charge. Franklin stepped back from the machine, turned to the kids, and spoke, “Lady, Sir, Hesh.” Nodding to the three. “I thank you for your help these last few days. It is now time for me to return. Please retreat to the minimum safe distance down the hill, I will give you five minutes.” He smiled, and the trio smiled back.

Molly, Sam, and Hesh stood some twenty feet down the hill from the decrepit mansion, and waited. As they watched, there was a spark of mana that leapt from one end of the roof to the other, then another spark, than a cascade of sparks showering the mansion, then there was no mansion.

Moments later, the ever-present thunderstorm began to clear. Hesh turned to Molly and Sam, “Do you think he made it?”

Molly and Sam looked to each other, then back to Hesh, and in unison the trio replied, “It would take a miracle!”

And the trio started down the road to the small village.

20xx, NYC, New York,

The drunk leaned against a rusted stop sign, staring at the fireworks over the old abandoned lot. A lot that was haunted enough that not only didn’t the city touch it, but neither did the developers or the gangs. He watched the sparkling lights arc around the lot, bouncing off of greenery and small bits of windblown trash caught in the brush.

There was a dim flash of light, and a building appeared in the vacant lot. The drunk nodded, slugged down the rest of his vile gut rot, and tottered off to tell his friends of the new house on the block.

It's been a minute.

Christmas went well. Brother Proof is gaining a level at the end of the month. Due to all the shit going down here in Minnesota, my lady love is looking for a new job. Depression is what it is, and I'm still not dead.

A buddy let me play in his world, and that project is almost done. Currently at 5981 words. Probably another 2-3k words left. Will be the longest short story I've ever written.

Working spuraticly on a book of guns for multiple systems. More on that as it comes closer to fruition.

I'm heading down to Tennessee the first week of March to visit an online friend who I've known for several years now. Should be fun. :) 

June will be full for me; writing convention, NCCC reunion, and birthday will fill it right up. 

 

Until next time, be safe, have fun, and live out of spite!

I have beed experiencing some issues with my iPhone and iPad when I had installed the iOS 26.2

iPhone 12 Pro:

Whenever I am using music app (ie Spotify) or telephone app when I swipe them to the backgroung it mars the music and the person I am talking with super quiet - to the point I can barely hear them. 

iPad Air M2 11’:

In general it feels like it works slower and less smoothly. 

Main issue I have is with the files app and preview app. I cant move files between the folders because I just receive information that just says „That action is forbidden” and thats it. It is especially frustrating when I use the Preview app - scanned documents end up in „lately used” and cannot be moved. Same action I can perform without any issue on my phone. 

Some apps dont rotate with the screen (for example app for the board game Kill Team) even though it used to rotate. Others rotate not as smoothly. 

The changes I have made on my iPad recently that may influence this:

I have installed VPN for my work. I have pured coffee on my Logitech keyboard but it didnt reach the iPad itself - keyboard lags though. May this be an issue?

Some days, parenting doesn’t feel like a beautiful journey. It feels loud. It feels messy. It feels like you’re answering the same question 47 times while your coffee goes cold and your to‑do list laughs at you from the corner.

For the longest time, I thought the solution was “doing more” — better routines, stricter schedules, more productivity hacks. But honestly? That just made me more tired.

What actually helped was learning how to **pause on purpose**, even for just a few minutes.

I started asking myself one simple question during hard moments:  
👉 *“What actually matters right now?”*

Not today. Not this week. **Right now.**

Sometimes the answer was: forget the dishes and sit on the floor with my kid.  
Sometimes it was: take five minutes alone in the bathroom and breathe.  
And sometimes it was: say no — even to things that felt “important.”

That mindset shift helped me get out of survival mode and back into myself as a parent *and* a human.

Recently, I came across a resource that really put words and structure around this idea in a way that felt realistic (not Pinterest‑perfect). It focuses on small, doable resets instead of massive life overhauls, which is honestly what most of us need. One part that stood out to me was the idea of filtering decisions through simple questions and giving yourself permission to have “not today” days.

If you’re curious, this is the guide I’m talking about:  
👉 [**The 5-Minute Mom Blueprint: Reclaim Your Time, Sanity, and Joy in the Chaos of Motherhood**](https://doparenting.com/The-5-Minute-Mom-Blueprint-ebook)

What I appreciate most is that it doesn’t talk *at* moms or parents. It feels like someone sitting next to you saying, “Yeah… this is hard. Let’s make it lighter, one small step at a time.”

I wanted to share this here not as a “fix,” but as a reminder:  
You don’t need more pressure.  
You don’t need perfection.  
Sometimes, five intentional minutes can change the entire tone of your day.

Would love to hear from you —

1qi2ntc,https://i.redd.it/ufreq7c8mieg1.jpeg,JSF Leverages Bright Light and Nap Time to Fine-Tune Performance Timing,"With the Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics set to open on February 6, the Japanese figure skating team is aiming to win multiple medals, including gold. To enhance performance, the team has been focusing on improving sleep quality, and this time, napping may hold the key to achieving their goals. (Hiroyuki Okada)

*(Photo provided by JSF: Athlete Kaori Sakamoto using high-intensity light treatment during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics)*

Kaori Sakamoto (Sysmex) in women’s singles, and the pairs team of Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara (Kinoshita Group), are among those targeting gold medals. With the addition of the team event, the competition spans two weeks, and many events will take place at night. In the individual events, the final group of skaters is expected to perform from around 10:00 p.m.

To help athletes peak at the right time, the Japan Skating Federation places strong emphasis on sleep quality. Insufficient sleep not only increases fatigue but also reduces spatial awareness—an essential skill in figure skating—as well as the ability to make split-second decisions and handle multitasking during performances. It also raises the risk of injury.

A typical athlete’s schedule during the Beijing Winter Olympics

At the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, many events were held during the day. Athletes typically woke up between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m., trained in the morning, and then competed. To secure eight hours of sleep, they needed to go to bed around 7:00 p.m. the previous evening.

Melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep and wake cycles, is said to begin secreting 14 to 16 hours after exposure to strong sunlight, promoting sleep. By working backward from bedtime, athletes used strategies such as early-morning exposure to bright light. Athletes reported that “even when we had to go to bed early, we were able to sleep well,” and that “waking up felt easier, and the body felt ready to move.” These measures contributed to Japan’s silver medal in the team event and a total of three individual medals in Beijing.

In contrast, many events at the Milan–Cortina Olympics will begin between 7:00 and 9:00 p.m., with on-ice practice sessions scheduled at the competition venue from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. As a result, post-lunch naps will play an important role this time. Short naps, known as “power naps,” have recently gained attention in both sports and business for their ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity. Consuming a moderate amount of caffeine—such as green tea or coffee—before napping is also believed to help athletes wake up feeling more alert.

According to the federation, research shows that a 30–60 minute nap after lunch provides beneficial effects on both physical and cognitive performance. In Milan, the team will create daily schedules aligned with competition times to establish optimal circadian rhythms for peak performance. Athletes will be provided with eye masks and earplugs, along with guidance on appropriate caffeine intake, to support high-quality sleep.

Yosuke Takeuchi (竹内洋輔), Head of Figure Skating Development at the Japan Skating Federation, said, “It becomes a problem when athletes feel anxious about when they should sleep or how they should spend their time. We want to rely on scientific evidence so they can compete with peace of mind and fully focus on their performance.”

I (38F) have been with my fiancé (39M) for over a year, if that matters, and we have shared a home for six months. We argued on Saturday, and the situation escalated to the point where my fiancé still doesn't talk to me. 

I was supposed to be at work, but I stayed home because I had the flu. My fiancé unexpectedly told me that he was going to a friend's house for coffee in a couple of hours. I asked why he didn't tell me about it earlier, since he knew I was home, and he's been sick too, I assumed he was spending time with me, because there had been no talk of anything else. I often work weekends, and he's always off, so this kind of opportunity is quite rare.

He got furious, yelling at me that he wasn't going to be under my thumb and that I shouldn't control him. While shouting, he threw a coffee cup at the wall. 

At no point did I say that he should stay home, but I asked him to tell me in advance about his plans. I have never forbidden him from going anywhere, because \*I don't want to do that\*, but knowing the schedule would make me feel better. Instead, I would be happy if he would see more of his friends, because maintaining relationships has been challenging for him.

I tried to talk to him on Sunday and Monday, but he mostly grumbles and or doesn't say anything. He feels justified in his behavior because he's pissed off. He doesn't understand why I stress about things like this, and he finds it a problem to fulfill my wish that I would like to know about the plans in advance, because ""he hasn't had to tell anyone about it in his previous relationships,"" and ""he forgets things easily,"" so he only tells me things when they are about to happen.

He is seeing a psychiatrist, and he is being investigated for possible bipolar disorder and/or borderline personality disorder. On Sunday he told that he hasn't taken the medication he was prescribed to stabilize his mood for about a week. He doesn't think this is part of the problem, but is just very angry because I'm an annoying spouse. 

Is it too much to ask that he tell me about his future plans in the context of normal daily conversation? AITA?

This question is very obscure and probably of no real importance, but I know we enjoy that kind of thing here.

In ""The Hobbit"", Bilbo puts on a pot of coffee, as well as tea, for Thorin and Co. Tolkien later regretted some of the out-of-place things he put into the first edition of ""The Hobbit"" (e.g. off the top of my head, mentions of policemen and trains coming out of tunnels) before he understood how The Shire fit in with his vision of Middle-Earth and Arda. 

In ""The Lord of the Rings"", which adjusted descriptions of hobbits and The Shire to better integrate them into Tolkien's world, the hobbits still drink tea, but there is no coffee anywhere. For example, I thought that coffee might be mentioned as one of the delicacies that Saruman was hoarding in Isengard along with pipe-weed, but it isn't.

Why do you think this is? I just checked, and it seems like coffee and tea both reached Europe and England at roughly the same time in the 1600s. Would Tolkien have decided that coffee was culturally less ""redolent of our ‘air’ (the clime and soil of the North West, meaning Britain and the hither parts of Europe: not Italy or the Aegean, still less the East)""? Maybe coffee is a drink favored by the Haradrim?",37,1768919155.0,tolkienfans,83,0.84,False

I went out to a specific mall/galery that only has anime/video games/k-pop/alt culture related stores. There are plenty of these in my city and around this one is full of asian convenience stores, cute cafes, etc. So it's usually a busy area with a lot of weebs, myself included. There are also many TCG shops nearby.

I wanted to go to a specific store to buy a precure cookie charm blind bag, but the store was closed so i went to a Pokémon TCG store to buy a card that my fiance was looking for.

At the store, a man in his forties approached me and asked if I played the TCG. I told him no, that I was only interested in collecting and that my partner was the player. The man gave me a strange look and said something like, ""typical of a little girl"" (i'm a adult btw) He started asking me which Pokémon I liked to collect. I answered him coldly because I really wasn't interested in talking to him, but he kept trying to talk to me. He was not being friendly at all btw, his tone was very condesending. I don't mind friendly small talk but this wasnt it.

I guess he noticed the pins in my bag because he started asking me about the anime I like. I kept answering coldly, and he started saying that I probably only bought them because they're trendy and that ""that's why my answers didn't reflect the deep knowledge of a true fan"" he then started asking me trick questions to try and test my knowledge about certain anime, but at that point I just decided to give him a weird look.

He said he was sorry if ""being proven to be a poser made me feel bad"" and offered to buy me a coffee to ""educate me properly."" He also called me ""pretty for being a poser"". I reminded her that I have a partner, and by that time the saleswoman had realized the situation and intervened, asking him if he needed help with anything.

I didn't find the card I needed, but I did find a man who felt entitled to my time, to question me, to call me a poser, and then, on top of that, invited me for coffee afterwards???

Not the weirdest one i've met but he was the most entitled yet. or maybe i am overreacting idk.

Edit to clarify: when he called me a ""little girl"" (niñita) he was being condesending. i do not look like a child so i don't think he thought I was a teen. i believe look my age (mid 20s)",153,1768919129.0,EntitledPeople,56,0.86,False
