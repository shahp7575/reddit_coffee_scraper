by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Nashville Predators vs. Detroit Red Wings: A Tale of Two Wings (Literally)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a showdown between the Nashville Predators, who’ve been playing hockey like a toddler with a snowplow, and the Detroit Red Wings, who are trying to prove that “Red Wings” isn’t just a cry for help from a bygone era. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni on a budget.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Detroit enters as a **1.5-goal favorite** (-156), implying bookmakers think they’ve got a **60.87% chance** to win. Nashville, the underdog (+130), has a **28.57% implied probability**—which is about the same chance Roman Josi has of convincing anyone that last Monday’s 8-3 loss to Florida was “a good learning experience.”

The **over/under is 5.5-6 goals**, with the over priced slightly lower. Detroit has scored over 5.5 goals in **15 of 23 games** this season—imagine if they brought a blizzard to a snowball fight. Nashville, meanwhile, has been a leaky dam, allowing **6.9 goals per game** on the road. If this game were a soup, it’d be a bouillabaisse of scoring chaos.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Effort, and the Ghost of Power Plays Past

**Nashville’s woes** are as deep as Juuse Saros’s save percentage (.889). After an **8-3 loss to Florida**, Captain Roman Josi called the performance “horrible” and accused the team of playing like “a group of penguins in a sauna” (no shade to penguins—they’re just… not athletes). Saros, who allowed 5 goals on 16 shots in that game, is 6-9-3 on the season. Backup Justus Annunen? He’s 0-3-1 with a **4.07 GAA** and .836 save percentage—stats so惨 that even a coffee table would feel more confident in net.

**Detroit**, on the other hand, has **Dylan Larkin and Alex DeBrincat** firing on all cylinders (25 points each) and Cam Talbot in net, who’s 9-3-0 with a **2.79 GAA**. Their power play is a **21.3% beast**, ranked 13th in the league—think of it as a well-trained goose that can’t be shooed away. Nashville’s penalty kill (82.5%) is decent, but against Detr

👋 hey yall - don't think i can be anonymous anymore given my name is slapped onto these maps, but what's up, my name's kelli & i've been living in lafayette for about 17 years.

originally i'm from pierre part (🐊swamp people land) & have family that comes to town often & they *always* ask for places to eat, things to do, or where to find something if they're in for a shopping trip. as i'm sure many of y'all have whether it's cousins, in-laws, old friends who haven't been back in a while, co-workers coming down for a work trip, whatever.

and of course, like clockwork, i blank out on what to recommend because when you live here, it's impossible to remember the 300+ local restaurants we have or 80+ thrift/antique/pawn shops that are around. it's a lot and tbh, i get tired of trying to find shit 😅

also, it's 🎄holiday season & since 🦃 thanksgiving 🦃 is tomorrow, i'm sure many of you are stressed with managing guests who don't know the area.

in the spirit of giving a big middle finger to gatekeepers and paywalls, i decided that the tool i made for myself should be made free & shared to the public because why the hell not?

**there's 3 maps:**

[food](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1q7SI2kNeslhqGekEt_H6SOxEa6ok1DM&ehbc=2E312F) \- plate lunches, chains, local, coffee, sweets, ect  
[things to do](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=16ysIlsgTBOBAFQqijNO29D152qXI630&hl=en&ehbc=2E312F) \- live music venues, museums, entertainment, parks, ect.  
[shopping](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1cg9-QcwEyiE26P62wjLyy3WfXsNeGAU&hl=en&ehbc=2E312F) \- boutiques, chains, thrifts, vape shops, & if ya car breaks down along the way

all feedback is welcome, this is for **this community** to use at your will. if you would like to see a category added, please let me know!

**FAQ**

**DO I NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING?**  
if you have google maps or a browser on your phone, then no. the links will open up in google maps.

**CAN I MAKE A COPY OF YOUR WORK & ADD MY OWN LOCATIONS OR CATEGORIES?**  
absolutely. google maps is what i used, and i clearly don't have proprietary ownership of their software. do what you want!

**WHY THREE MAPS?**  
google maps has a limit on how many ""layers""/categories you can add to one custom map, which is why i had to separate this out in such a way.

**CAN I CONTACT YOU FOR MISSING/NEW BUSINESS ADDITIONS OR CORRECTIONS?**  
absolutely - just know i can't add or edit changes immediately if i'm not by a laptop as this feature on google maps requires desktop capability and cannot be edited on mobile. i don't know why, and trust me i have tried. your changes will be added within 2-3 days. i also have a full time job, so give me grace 😅

**WHY ARE THERE SOME PLACES MISSING I.E. A RESTAURANT OR BAR?**

1. though i'm not a fan of cancel culture or not going to a place just because your sister doesn't like the manager, i do believe that there are business owners who are threats to certain demographics' safety within the community as well as those who hold ideals that promote violence - i won't explain that one - we are all grown, make the inference. i don't support them. if you would like to make a copy of this map & include them, so be it, mine will leave them off.
2. maybe they're a newer business and i haven't added them yet OR they haven't advertised on google which is where i got most of my pins from. i was relying heavily on my own knowledge base as well as perusing this entire city on maps. if your business isn't on here, if it's not explained in the first reason, know it's not personal & i can add you very easily. this is a work in progress, and i would like to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible. the winds of business change a lot, so forgive mistakes, and feel free to let me know when a correction is needed.

**IS THIS REALLY FREE AND WILL IT STAY FREE?**  
yes, it really is free. google maps is not a paywalled software, and all toggles are on the public setting for accessing these maps. it will ALWAYS be free as this is a **community resource** and is not sponsored by anyone. i include businesses from all around the community - not just river ranch, the south side, or the oil center. it is all inclusive because it is for **everyone** which means a wide spectrum of businesses are displayed for any and all income levels.",1,1764195019.0,Acadiana,0,1.0,False

First of all, if you own a business and you’re spending this much time on your website, hire someone. 

Secondly, LLMs are not search engines. They won’t crawl, index, or rank your website. Google and Bing will. 

If you want something to focus on, as u/WebLinkr often promotes, look into query drift and query fan-out. 

What is query drift and QFO? Well, I asked an LLM for “best Christmas gifts for parents”. Some actual queries it used were:

“top Christmas gifts 2025”
“parents weekend getaway”
“parents spa day voucher”
“professional family photo book”
“luxury coffee machine”

As you can see, these queries have “fanned out” from our original ask. The LLM then combined the top results from these queries into a comprehensive answer to my original question.

Learn how to rank for these, and you’ll see much larger improvements than taking the time to implement an llms.txt file.

Overall they’re a very lively and positive group which is great, but sometimes they take things too far. I constantly get attitude from them. I’ve called home, given detentions, and sent kids to the office for being unsafe in the shop (roughhousing and whatnot). I’ve honestly never had issues with classroom management like this. Normally I have a good handle on things. 

Today, they were being disrespectful and completely ignoring me while I gave instruction. I raised my voice and was very firm. I said “ it’s really frustrating coming to this class sometimes when you guys are so disrespectful to me. I have no issues with my morning classes, then I come here and get the shit kicked out of me. I think you’re all great kids but you’re really rude sometimes when you act this way. “

A group of kids actually approached me and said I’m being fair and reasonable and that some kids are honestly just not being respectful. I thanked them. They even said they wanted to buy me a coffee lol. 

Anyways, later on, me and the same two kids as always were cleaning up while everyone sat around on their phones. Someone left something on they shouldn’t have and I cut myself (minor but still annoying). I then dropped something on accident and it broke. Of course. One kid offered to help me pick it up which I was grateful for. But I was thinking out loud and I was like “how frustrating is this that everyone is sitting around on their phones being lazy asses and it’s the same kids every day pulling their weight. It’s ridiculous. “

I’m basically stressed because I swore in front of them. I have never done that. But I reached a point where I was so frustrating today.. I seriously was at my breaking point. I’m so nervous a parent is going to complain and blow this up and say I’m calling the kids asses. 

I know I should’ve been more careful with my words. I feel really stressed now. Should I tell admin? Or leave it alone? Perhaps reach out to my union rep? ",4,1764194919.0,Teachers,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I got tired of scrolling through the endless grid of offers on capitaloneoffers.com and clicking ""View More Offers"" a million times. So I made a bookmarklet that:

1. **Automatically loads ALL offers** (no more clicking ""View More"")
2. **Shows them in a clean, sortable table**
3. **Lets you search by merchant name**
4. **Sort by Fixed Miles or X Miles** (find those 20X offers fast!)

# What it looks like

The bookmarklet shows a modal with all your offers in a table format:

* **Merchant** \- Logo + domain name
* **Miles** \- Fixed miles (green badge) or X multiplier (blue badge)
* **Channel** \- Online/In-Store
* **Open** \- Click to activate the offer

1p7l1lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p7l1lg/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_can_never_borrow/,AITA for telling my sister she can never borrow my car again because she keeps smoking in it (I have asthma + 5 year old kid),"im 28f, single mom to a wild 5 year old boy. freelance graphic designer, money is tight af since the divorce. only car i have is the old honda my dad left me when he died last year. its literally how we survive.



my sister lila whos 25 doesnt own a car, works at a coffee shop and has a ton of student loans. 6 months ago she needed mine for a job interview. i said fine but NO smoking in it at all because i have asthma that gets scary bad and my kid is always in the back seat.



she promised, brought it back clean, cool.



then like a month ago she begged for it again for some “super important doctor thing” (was literally just a checkup). reminded her no smoking especially since my son was already sickish. she rolled her eyes but said ok.



got the car back and it REEKED of cigarettes. ash everywhere, burn mark on the armrest. aired it out for days and my kid started coughing the second he got in and i had a full asthma attack that had me shaking.



she gave the shittiest “sorry stress!!” excuse and swore she only smoked outside. obvious lie.



let it go because family blah blah



last week she asks again to go pick up her crap from her exs place. i offered to drive her myself. she flipped out, called me controlling selfish etc and said she’d just febreze it. i finally said no, car is off limits to her forever now.



now my mom and some aunts are blowing up my phone saying im heartless and its “just a smell” and family helps family.



im shaking typing this. aita for finally saying enough??

She’d been right: despite everything that happened in dreamland, I didn’t feel tired at all. If anything, I felt annoyingly refreshed.



""How did you sleep?"" Mom asked, looking up from her coffee with her innocent smile.



""You’re really going to pretend you didn’t know about Kelce?""



""I have no idea what you’re talking about,"" she said, grinning like a cat who had absolutely eaten the canary.



""Uh-huh."" I sighed. ""So what’s the plan for this week? Are you going to close the gym for a bit?""



""There’s no need to close the gym,"" she said brightly. ""And actually, we’re going there today. I invited some people.""



""Who exactly?""



""An old... well, not a friend, but someone I’ve known for a long time. His daughter is one of the kids you met on Friday. She’s bringing some of her friends to train. Apparently, Hana is one of them, so at least I didn’t need to send her an invitation.""



""Ah. Then those must be the ‘other guys’ she said she invited for movie night,"" I nodded.



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



We arrived early at Mom’s gym. I wanted a head start on meeting the new people, but apparently, they had the same idea. Five kids were already clustered outside, and I immediately recognized three of them: Hana, Kelce, and Bozo the clown boy.



""Hi, kids,"" Mom greeted as she fished out her keys. ""I’ll open the gym. Warm up a bit before Jürgen joins us.""



""Hey, guys,"" I waved while she worked the lock.



""Kelce told us about your little nightmare adventure,"" Hana said. ""Damn, I wish I’d been there.""



""I can pull you into my dream tonight if you want,"" Kelce offered. ""I can bring multiple people at once.""



""Hard pass,"" Bozo said, shaking his head. ""I like sleeping without emotional damage.""



My attention drifted to the two people I didn’t recognize: a boy and a girl.



""Oh, right,"" Hana said. ""You guys don’t know each other yet. Guys, he is Max, Creepy Carol’s son, also known as Friday’s baby-beater.""



""Please don’t brand that as a nickname,"" I shook my head.



""Taura Sternritter,"" the girl said, giving me a firm handshake. She looked mostly normal, aside from the fluffy blonde mane and the pair of cattle-like horns curling from her skull.



""Elek,"" the boy said in a voice so flat it could be used as a table. His handshake was limp, his pale skin nearly translucent, his hair was white like snow, and his half-shut, bloodshot eyes made him look like he hadn’t slept since he was born.



""Nice to meet you, Max,"" he continued, but the voice didn’t come from his mouth.



It came from beside me.



I turned, and a ghostly duplicate of him hovered there, with the same hair and face, but somehow looked more alive.



""Oh, uh..."" I pointed.



""Before you ask, no, I’m not a ghost,"" Elek said.



""Oh. Okay. Then...?""



“Astral projection.”



""Cool,"" I said. ""I saw a documentary about that. Aren’t you supposed to be asleep for it, though?""



""Well, I am asleep."" His astral form gestured at his physical one. Sure enough, his real body looked like it was sleepwalking with its eyes half shut. ""The body wanders, the mind wanders elsewhere. Not ideal for coordination, but at least my muscles don’t atrophy.""



""Khm."" Mom cleared her throat like a hard reset button. ""Inside, kids.""



We entered the gym and changed into our gear.



""So,"" I said while stretching, ""which one of you is the daughter of Mom’s mysterious guest?"" I looked between Kelce and Taura.



""It’s me,"" Taura said, lifting a hand.



""And what’s the plan for today?"" I asked.



""Dad wants to test us a little,"" she explained. ""He’s one of the organizers of a German martial arts tournament. I’m not promising anything, but if he’s impressed, he might invite some of you.""



""Sounds cool,"" I said. ""Haven’t left the country for a tournament in a while. And those were just normal ones, not paranormal. What kind of styles are allowed?""



""Pretty much anything,"" she said. ""But, um… there’s something you should know about my family first.""



""What is it?"" Hana asked.



Taura opened her mouth, but before she could answer, Mom slammed the front door open like she was kicking off a WWE entrance.



""Kids, let me introduce you to Jürgen Sternritter,"" Mom announced.



And then he walked in.



A Minotaur.



A huge Minotaur, three meters tall, stacked with enough muscle to put bodybuilders out of business. His horns grazed the doorframe as he ducked inside, but that wasn’t the part that made my brain almost blue-screen.



He was wearing a Nazi officer’s uniform.



And not a subtle one. He had the full red armband, swastikas, medals, and an iron cross. 



""Dad,"" Taura groaned, dragging her palm down her face, ""please tell me you did not ride the metro dressed as the Nazis’ furry mascot.""



""Nah, nah, I put the uniform on in the car!"" he said, laughing deep from his bull chest.



""I see your dad has a very healthy sense of humor,"" Bozo said with a grin.



""No,"" Taura corrected, ""my family actually consists of ex-paranormal war criminals.""



""My comrades and I served in a secret Minotaur unit of the SS,"" Jürgen said proudly. ""We were unstoppable.""



""You weren’t, Dad,"" Taura sighed. ""Otherwise we’d all be speaking German right now.""



""Khm."" Mom cleared her throat again. ""Can we focus on the reason you're here?""



""Of course."" He nodded and turned back to us. ""I am one of the organizers of the Übermenschen-Turnier.""



""I haven't heard of it,"" Hana said. ""Is it international?""



""It's invitation-only, but competitors from all corners of the world can enter. Also, this tournament is always held in a specific location in Germany.""



""Oh, so you came to see whether we're ready for it?"" Kelce asked.



""Not exactly."" He shook his head. ""Not now, at least. I’ll be at the tournament this Saturday to see what you all can really do. Right now, I just want a little taste. I want to know why my daughter chose you as her friend.""



""Dad, I already told you, I don’t choose my friends based on how strong they are,"" Taura sighed. ""Otherwise, that blonde girl would be here too.""



""That's just what you think."" He snorted. ""But fate always brings the strongest players into the same game. There's a reason you met.""



""We just took the same elevator on Friday, and that’s how we met,"" Hana whispered to me.



""Alright, Jürgen. Let’s start this little test. But keep yourself contained."" Mom pointed a finger at him. ""Claude can fix their broken bones, but not the walls and floor.""



""Do not worry, Frau Creepy,"" he chuckled. ""I have perfect control over myself. I'm a soldier, after all.""



He shrugged off the coat of his uniform, revealing his muscular upper body. ""So, who wants to be first?""



""I volunteer,"" Bozo said.



""Alright, let's start then."" Jürgen nodded and reached for a big plastic bottle of mineral water on the shelf. ""I can use this?""



""Yeah, I prepared them for you,"" Mom said.



Jürgen unscrewed the cap in one move and held the bottle in his left hand. With his right palm open, he tipped the bottle and poured the water into his hand, every last drop. The water should have splashed to the floor. Instead, it moved across his skin like soft, viscous jelly, pooling and then stretching.



Slowly, the liquid reshaped itself into a long, thin blade. 



""Nice trick,"" Bozo said. He reached into his pocket, produced a long, deflated balloon, and began to inflate it with a few huffs. When it was full, he folded and twisted it into a ridiculous but serviceable sword. ""Let's see if this can match up against my Clown Fu.""



""Let's see if your Clown Fu can match up against my Mensur,"" Jürgen replied with a grin.



\[Note: Mensur is academic fencing.\]



Jürgen assumed a fencer stance: precise, compact, everything measured. Bozo adopted an absurdly exaggerated pose, one hand on his hip, the balloon-sword angled like a parade prop.



""Show me your first form, Clown,"" Jürgen said.



Bozo flourished. ""Prepare for Clown Fu, Style No. 4: Seltzer Serpent Slash!""



He lunged. The balloon-sword squeaked as it cut the air.



Jürgen parried, his water-sword answering in a clean, sharp arc. Though it was liquid, the blade moved like metal, biting through the air. He pressed forward with a series of short, disciplined thrusts. Bozo hopped back on his oversized shoes, keeping the fight flashy and mobile.



""Fast,"" Bozo chuckled. ""I like fast.""



Jürgen increased the tempo. He feinted low, probing for an opening, then pulled the attack back; an invitation. Bozo obliged with a wide, showy spin... and vanished.



Not with smoke, not with a pop; Bozo exploded into a cloud of glitter. It wasn't dangerous, only dazzling: shiny dust that stayed in the air like a thousand tiny stars. 



Jürgen blinked. ""Cute trick.""



""Ta-daa!"" Bozo spoke from another corner, followed by the sound of confetti raining down. 



Jürgen pivoted and swung; Bozo burst again, glitter erupting around him. 



""Can't hit what you can't catch!"" Bozo crowed, each reappearance belted with clownish bravado.



Jürgen did not smile. He narrowed his eyes and breathed out. ""Now I see.""



With another colorful explosion, Bozo reappeared near Adolt, but this time, he was quick and executed a single, clean upward slash.



There was a crisp tearing noise, and the balloon-sword in Bozo's hand sagged as if its latex had been neatly carved.



Bozo stared down at his weapon. Where there had been a single silly sword now lay six perfectly sliced lengths of balloon, wobbling faintly and hissing as air escaped.



""My sword!"" Bozo said, incredulous. 



""Do you accept your defeat or want me to cut more than just that balloon?"" Jürgen asked.



""Okay, okay, you won. But how did you know where I would reappear?""



""Since the air was full of glitter, I could see the spot where your body would pop up next time."" He explained, ""You know, teleporters don't just disappear and reappear somewhere else. Their particles need space where they can rebuild themselves. So each time your body does this, the air is pushed away right before you reappear. It's usually hard to notice, but the glitter in the air showed me where you will be next.""



""How do you know all this stuff about teleporting and particles, Dad?"" Taura asked.



""One of my old friends is a scientist at NASA,"" he answered. 



""And how did you do that water thingy?"" Bozo asked. ""Nazi supersoldier experiments?""



""No,"" Jürgen said, shaking his head. ""We Minotaurs bear the power of Poseidon. The bull who fathered the first Minotaur was his creation. So we all have a connection to him.""



""To me, it’s hydrokinesis through the power of belief,"" Mom added. ""Also known as the Tulpa effect.""



Great. An ex-Nazi, martial arts expert, Minotaur, who’s also a waterbender blessed by a god. That’s how my Monday starts.



The rest of that day was equally weird, but we’ll get to that later. For now, back to the present.



""Who's next?"" Jürgen asked.



""Me,"" Hana said, raising her hand.



""Hey, do you believe in that stuff?"" I whispered to Taura as Hana and Jürgen got into position.



""Um… I take part in some traditions, I guess? But no, I'm not into the Nazi stuff. Dad isn’t really a full-on Nazi either. Minotaurs just love fighting. That’s why the Nazis hired them. They hate all humans equally, not just minorities.""



""I meant the Poseidon part,"" I clarified.



""Oh. Yeah, no. Not that either."" She shook her head. ""I think we’re just... mutants. The hybrid physiology and the water powers are just two random side effects.""



Hana ripped off her empty human face, revealing her red Oni features. ""I'm ready,"" she said.



""Ah, the brute strength of an Oni,"" Jürgen grinned. ""Let’s test our brute strength in a Ringen.""



\[Note: Ringen is a German term for unarmed combat in general.\]



The water sword in his hand changed shape, splitting into thin strips of rings that wrapped around his arms.



""Armbands made of water? How’s that supposed to help him?"" Bozo asked.



""Those armbands are loaded with kinetic energy,"" Taura explained. ""His arms can move faster now.""



""Oh, so it’s like what Bambi does, just with water instead of gold,"" I said.



""Yeah. Most kinetic-power users charge up a material with kinetic energy,"" Taura said, nodding. ""But the material itself doesn’t always matter. What Bambi does would still work if she used paper, dust, glass, or even pebbles. She loads that gold dust with so much energy that the type of material becomes irrelevant.""



""Oh? And how does that work?"" I asked as Hana and Jürgen started grappling. ""Because from what I’ve seen, you guys don’t really get to pick your material.""



""Right. Most kinetics can only manipulate one material, sometimes two. You can train yourself to use others, but it’s extremely hard. Only a handful of people can manipulate multiple materials on a professional level.""



""Well, I don't have any material,"" I said. ""I just charge up my body parts with energy. Plus I’ve got that super weak, short-range telekinesis.""



""I saw that on Friday,"" she said. ""Your category is called unspecialized.""



""And that's... bad?""



""Not necessarily."" She shook her head. Meanwhile, Hana and the Minotaur were trying to tear each other apart. ""Since you’re not locked to a single material, you can experiment with lots of different ones. You’ll never master all of them, but having a broad toolkit can be useful if you’re creative.""



Jürgen suddenly got the upper hand. He wrapped his massive arms around Hana’s neck, dragging her into a chokehold.



Hana reached up, grabbed her Oni face, and ripped it off, revealing a scaly, fish-like face underneath.



With that new face, she lunged toward one of Jürgen’s water armbands and sucked it dry. Then she turned back toward him and blasted the stolen water into his face at high speed. The impact cracked through the gym like a gunshot.



The Minotaur staggered backward, releasing her.



""Ha ha! You tricky kleines Mädchen,"" he rumbled, laughing. ""You win.""



""Good job, Hana,"" Taura said with a thumbs-up.



""Yeah, what kind of face was that?"" I asked.



""My Ningyo face,"" she explained. ""I can swim faster with it, and I can spit water like a cannon.""



""Nice. I can only do something similar with a really small amount of water. Mostly my saliva,"" Taura added.



""Really? Show it!"" Bozo said.



Taura glanced around and spotted a fly zipping by overhead. ""Watch this,"" she said. She spat, and her saliva sliced the fly clean in half mid-air.



""Cool!"" Bozo said, eyes sparkling.



""Who’s next?"" Jürgen asked, as if he hadn’t just gone a round with an Oni-Ningyo hybrid.



""I can give it a try,"" Kelce said.



""Ahh... a Buhmann,"" Jürgen said with an approving nod.



""Yeah. I know there's no way I'd be as strong as you outside the dreamlands,"" Kelce admitted. ""But I can make this fight a little more balanced.""



A small, pale puff of cloud appeared above her head. It swelled, darkened, and compressed into a perfect black ring. A moment later, something enormous forced its way through.



A monster dropped onto the floor, a Minotaur-shaped horror, twice as feral as Jürgen. Black fur. Hooked claws at the fingertips. Burning red eyes. Foam dripping in thick strings from its jaws as a rabid wolf.



""Straight from the land of nightmares,"" Kelce announced. ""I caught this beauty from a torero's nightmare. He almost got gored to death by a bull once.""



Jürgen didn’t flinch. He grinned at the beast the same way someone grins at an unruly puppy. A very large, murderous puppy.



He snatched a few plastic bottles off the table, uncapped them, and dumped the water over himself. Thin rivulets clung to his skin, then fused into a liquid shell that hugged every inch of skin. The water vibrated with barely contained kinetic energy.



""All right, kleiner Stier,"" Jürgen said to the nightmare. ""Come.""



The nightmare Minotaur charged first, snorting steam. It lowered its head to gore Jürgen clean off his feet.



Jürgen stepped forward instead of back.



He caught the beast by its horns.



The impact was louder than what I expected, but Jürgen didn’t budge. The kinetic-charged water around his arms rippled, amplifying his strength.



With a grunt, he twisted. The nightmare stumbled sideways.



It lashed out with a clawed swipe. Jürgen ducked, grabbed its wrist, and rolled his massive shoulder under the creature’s arm.



A perfect judo-style throw, executed by a three-meter Minotaur.



The nightmare hit the ground hard enough to shake dust from the lights.



It tried to rise.



Jürgen didn’t let it.



He wrapped his arms around its torso, lifted the monster clean off its hooves, and suplexed it into the ground. The water coating his body flashed, releasing kinetic bursts that cracked like wet gunshots.



The nightmare Minotaur roared, thrashing wildly, but Jürgen simply shifted, pinning it with ease.



One final twist.



One final slam.



The nightmare beast let out a strangled groan, and then its form buckled inward. It collapsed into a puff of oily black smoke, vanishing back to wherever Kelce had pulled it from.



Jürgen rose, brushing a stray wisp of darkness off his shoulder.



""Sehr gut,"" he said. ""A nice warm-up.""



Kelce flicked the dissipating smoke with her finger. ""Well... at least I made you breathe a little harder.""



""You did,"" Jürgen admitted with a grin. ""Two extra breaths.""



The next one to challenge him was Elek, both of him. His astral form floated ahead, while his sleepwalking physical body shuffled behind like a bored zombie.



""Which one of you wants to fight?"" Jürgen asked.



""I usually use my astral form,"" Elek said, sitting down on his own physical body’s shoulder like a depressed parrot. ""But my body can still do some stuff. We can fight separately or together.""



He slumped sideways slightly, very ghost-like. ""Together usually works better sometimes because I can control my real and astral bodies easier.""



""Oh, so you can ride on yourself,"" Jürgen nodded. ""Good. Then...""



The water coating his body rippled and lifted. It flowed upward, gathering on his shoulders and torso, sculpting itself into a humanoid shape. Arms, torso, head, and finally a pair of bull horns.



A watery Minotaur-like rider sat upon him.



""I brought my own, too,"" Jürgen chuckled. ""Let us do some Ringen zu Ross.""



\[Note: Ringen zu Ross is mounted grappling. Usually done on horseback.\]



Elek’s physical body charged first, slow, aimless, but surprisingly hard to knock down. Jürgen blocked lightly, pushing it aside with one arm while the water-golem rider tried to grapple Elek’s astral form.



Elek drifted upward like a helium balloon someone forgot to tie down.



""Come back here, kleiner Geist!"" Jürgen hissed. 



Elek floated behind it and gave the golem a shove. It stumbled, splashing slightly. Jürgen countered by twisting his torso, sending the golem whipping around like a figurehead on a ship.



Elek hopped off his own body, zipped around Jürgen, and then flew straight into the water-golem’s chest.



For a moment, the entire golem froze.



""Ah, he’s possessing it,"" Taura said, ""Smart move.""



""Very creative,"" Jürgen said, ""but you picked the wrong puppet.""



He put a hand on the golem, and the water began to vibrate.



""He is overcharging it with his kinetic energy,"" Hana remarked, ""He is also smart.""



Then the golem detonated in a geyser of water, spraying the entire gym like someone had dropped a water balloon the size of a bathtub.



Elek’s astral form shot out of the explosion like a soap bubble fleeing a toddler, drifting rapidly back into the air.



His physical body stood where it was, dripping, swaying, and then slumped over with a groan.



Mom wiped a droplet of water from her cheek. ""Jürgen. Clean. This. Up.""



Jürgen nodded solemnly. He snapped his fingers.



Every droplet, splatter, and puddle rippled, lifted, and streamed across the room toward him. It all gathered into a single enormous sphere of water hovering over his palm.



""Better?"" he asked.



""Much."" Mom said, though she still sounded mildly annoyed.



""Who’s next?"" Jürgen asked.



""I guess it’s my time to shine,"" Taura said.



She stepped forward and casually flicked her hand toward the shelf. One of the plastic bottles trembled, then shot straight into her palm. Taura twisted off the cap and poured water on both hands. The water crawled up her arms, thickening and shaping itself until she wore a pair of boxing gloves, bull-headed gauntlets complete with tiny curved horns.



Jürgen lifted the sphere of water hovering above his palm. It rippled, then split into a flock of doll-sized harpies, each with needle-like claws. Then he launched them like a scattershot burst.



Taura dashed through the oncoming swarm, weaving between the miniature harpies with sharp footwork and low slips. The moment she cleared the last one, she stepped in and slammed her fists into her father’s abdomen with everything she had. The horns of the bull-headed gloves punched through his skin before she yanked them back, leaving two pairs of clean punctures.



""Sehr gut,"" Jürgen rumbled, unfazed. A few blobs of water peeled away from the puddles around him and packed themselves into the wounds like liquid sutures.



""That was quick,"" I said as Taura jogged back, breathing hard.



""I put everything into that one,"" she panted. ""All or nothing. Sometimes risky is the only way.""



And then all eyes moved to me. It was my turn.



""Can I grab some water too?"" I asked.



""Of course,"" Mom said. ""What exactly are you planning?""



""I... don’t know yet. I just want to be experimental."" I snagged a bottle from the shelf. ""Sometimes you have to play riskily.""



I uncapped it and immediately realized I had absolutely no idea what I was doing.



Maybe if I pointed the bottle at him and pumped kinetic energy into it, it would blast water in his face?



No. Knowing my luck, I’d just detonate a plastic grenade into my own skull.



So.. now what?



Then a thought struck me. Hana and Taura both did mouth-based water tricks earlier. Why not me?



I lifted the bottle and chugged as much water as I could, puffing out my cheeks until they ached. At the same time, I tried channeling my kinetic energy into the water pooling inside.



And... it worked.



I felt the water rumbling and vibrating. I was about to unleash the most eco-friendly beam attack ever.



But the triumph lasted about three seconds.



The pressure spiked. I lost control. My cheeks ballooned even bigger, then boom, the water detonated inside my mouth. Two high-pressure jets blasted out of my nostrils like a disgusting sprinkler system. Blood mixed with the water in twin red streams in the end.



I dropped to my knees, choking and coughing.



Jürgen stared at me, stunned... then burst into thunderous laughter.



Once everyone realized I wasn’t dying, they all joined in.



""Pretty gross move,"" Jürgen wheezed between laughs, ""but I should have expected it from Frau Creepy’s kid!""



At least I managed to entertain him.



""Not bad,"" Mom giggled, ""but there’s a way to make it even grosser.""



""Do you... want to show us?"" I asked, morbid curiosity wrestling with dread.



""Yeah, let’s try it on me,"" Jürgen said confidently.



""Alright,"" Mom grinned, ""you asked for it.""



She bent down and picked up the half-empty bottle I’d dropped earlier. I braced myself for her to drink it, but instead she lifted the bottle to her nostril.



""Oh no,"" I whispered.



She tilted her head back and started pouring water straight up her nose. I knew what was about to come.



When I was little, Mom had a party trick that kept me up at night; she’d snort milk and then fire it out of her tear duct like some kind of cursed water fountain.



And now she was doing it again.



Except this time, she’d leveled up.



Twin jets of water blasted out of her tear ducts with fire-hose pressure. They hit Jürgen square in the face. He jerked back instantly, whether from the impact or the sheer horror of the attack, I honestly couldn’t tell.



The others around me wavered in hesitation. Half impressed. Half nauseated.

I was ninety percent sure I’d never be able to look at Mom the same way again.



But later that day, I learned more about her powers.



And apparently, this was just the disgusting intro level.",1,1764194795.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I live in the city centre and work from home 3 days per week. I’m currently looking for alternative places to work from as my current home location as I’m starting to get a little bored of working from my apartment, due to the nature of my work I can’t work from coffee shops or open places and would ideally prefer somewhere with one person working stations or ‘pods’. I tried Campfield recently which was fairly suitable but a little too open for my liking. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations for office/desk schemes in the city centre?

1p7kza5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p7kza5/aitah_for_telling_my_getting_frustrated_and/,AITAH for telling my getting frustrated and telling my husband ‘not to get her’,"So our 12 month old slept like crap last night. She kept waking up and unfortunately the only way we get her back to sleep is by the boob. So last night she was up every 3-4 hours and I was the one attending to her because I was the only one who could put her back to sleep. My husband layed next to me in bed all night asleep throughout it until 4.30 until she woke up again, about 20 minutes after I had been in the room with her again trying to get her back to sleep (to which she fell asleep). So at this point, I was super frustrated. My husband woke up after she was trying for a few minutes and says ‘I’ll go in there and get her up for the day’ I said ‘no - don’t you dare go in there. She is tired’ as I was trying to resist giving her a feed again to put her to sleep, 20 minutes after she had just fallen back asleep before.

She was still crying so I gave up and sighed “this is ridiculous’ out of frustration, got out of bed and went into her room again to feed her to sleep. Luckily, it got her to sleep again until 7.

This morning my husband got up, made coffee and got our daughter up. He came in with a coffee in a bad mood and said to me ‘do you think the way you behaved last night was okay’. Told me ‘my attitude’ wasn’t okay and that my ‘stomping’ has kept him up since 4am and he didn’t sleep well because of my behaviour at 4am. 

I obviously got super defensive, because I was the one who was up with our child all last night by myself while he slept; and then because I got frustrated my behaviour wasn’t okay as it woke him up. He is now claiming he also didn’t sleep well all night - which I call bullshit as I didn’t hear peep from him until 4.30am. 

It then caused an argument and as I told him the least he could do is thank me for my efforts last night because I was the one up with her for 100% of the time last night. He said that’s why he bought me a coffee, got our daughter up and unpacked the dishwasher this morning while I slept. I just think that is being a basic partner; and not stuff that is done in lieu of actually telling your partner that they did a good job last night and give them some support, instead of telling me my behaviour ‘wasn’t okay’.

AITAH here? I am so pissed off. He’s then walked out this morning to go to the gym and didn’t say bye or anything. We usually go to the gym together but today, he obviously didn’t want that. ",3,1764194709.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1p7kwd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheCarNut8/comments/1p7kwd2/willpower_is_bs_what_actually_helped_my_fried/,Willpower is BS - what actually helped my fried dopamine,"Two years ago I was completely stuck. Couldn't focus on anything meaningful for more than 10 minutes. Kept chasing quick hits - scrolling, gaming, binge-watching, other stuff I'm not proud of. My brain felt like it was running on fumes.



Everyone kept saying ""just use more willpower"" or ""just stop doing those things."" That advice made me feel like garbage because I'd tried willpower a thousand times. It was like my brain was actively working against me.



Then I learned something that changed everything: willpower isn't the problem. When you've been overstimulating your dopamine system for years, the receptors literally become less sensitive. It's not a character flaw - it's biology.



The real work wasn't about forcing myself to stop things. It was about slowly rebuilding my brain's ability to feel satisfaction from normal activities. Started ridiculously small - like actually tasting my coffee in the morning instead of mindlessly chugging it. Taking walks without podcasts. Sitting with boredom for just 5 minutes.



The hardest part was accepting how slow it was. For months, everything felt gray and boring. Normal activities that should feel rewarding just... didn't. I kept thinking I was broken permanently.



But somewhere around month 4-5, things started shifting. I could read a book again. Have a conversation without my mind wandering. Work on projects that mattered to me.



I'm still figuring this out honestly. Some days are better than others. But understanding the actual science behind it - that my brain needed time to physically heal, not more discipline - made all the difference.



Anyone else been through something similar? What helped you get through those early months when everything felt flat?",1,1764194508.0,u_TheCarNut8,0,1.0,False

Drugs taken now: none  
  
For the past 4+ months, I’ve noticed a significant change in how my body responds to substances and internal sensations. Substances that I normally would expect to feel have little to no effect on me, regardless of the route of administration. These include:

* Caffeine (coffee, energy drinks)(redbull
* Coffee
* Methadone (oral)
* Nicotine (smoking, vaping, oral)
* Cannabis (smoked or vaped)

Sometimes, I may feel the effects briefly for 1–2 minutes after 1–2 hours, but they quickly dissipate.

Additionally, my natural responses to internal sensations—such as fear, anxiety, or “fight or flight” reactions—feel blunted or dimmed.

I have already had bloodwork, kidney and liver tests, and endocrine testing done, all of which were reportedly normal.

Has anyone experienced anything like this, or could someone guide me on potential causes and next steps? I am unsure which type of specialist I should consult next. I have done a testosterone test which came back good.

1p7kt5t,https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/25/11/242830P.pdf,CA8 denies class certification in lawsuit over how many cups of coffee a tub of Folgers can make,"For context, you can skim the [original complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mowd.157242/gov.uscourts.mowd.157242.1.0.pdf). In short: plaintiffs say Folgers’ math about how many “cups of coffee” a tub could make was way off. The front of the can claimed 380 cups of coffee, but following the directions on the can would only produce around 265–275 cups. A variety of lawsuits were filed and consolidated in an MDL, and plaintiffs then sought class certification.

This particular class was limited to Missouri purchasers under the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. The Eighth Circuit held that the MMPA still requires a causal connection: the consumer has to suffer a loss as a result of the deceptive practice. On this record, the court said many putative class members weren’t harmed. Maybe they:

* Never saw the ""makes X cups"" language
* Saw it but didn't care
* Interpreted it differently (e.g. ""makes 380 weak cups of coffee"")

For those buyers, the label didn’t cause any loss—they got what they bargained for. Figuring out who actually overpaid because of the ""X cups"" statement would require buyer-by-buyer inquiries, which the court said defeats predominance under Rule 23(b)(3).

  
Plaintiffs also tried a theory that the statement inflated the overall market price, so everyone overpaid, but the court rejected that. You can’t just point to general price inflation as a substitute for an actual, individual ""ascertainable loss"" under MMPA. Their unjust-enrichment theory failed for similar reasons: whether it’s ""unjust"" for Folgers to keep the purchase price depends too much on the specifics of each transaction, which the court viewed as a bad fit for a (b)(3) damages class.

  
This has an interesting connection to SCOTUS: the DIG of [LabCorp v. Davis](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-304_3e04.pdf) this summer and Justice Kavanaugh's dissent, where he clearly has some anxiety about uninjured class members getting stuffed into a large class action.  He argued that federal courts may not certify a Rule 23 damages class that includes both injured and uninjured members because common issues don’t predominate.  However, he *also* pointed to concerns about overbroad classes creating massive settlement pressure and ""potentially ruinous liability"" that ""ultimately harms consumers, retirees, and workers"". The Folgers decision feels very much in that vein: it treats the presence of a substantial number of uninjured buyers as a reason to kill the class rather than trust price-premium economics to smooth it over.

  
We'll have to see if the court takes up another 23(b)(3) case in OT2025, but I suspect it won't be this one.",3,1764194310.0,supremecourt,2,1.0,False

Here’s what I did instead of pulling the trigger.,"I was the guy with the nightstand bottle, the coffee-maker shooters, the office-stall ritual, and the pistol in my hand two years ago.

# I Planned MY Suicide. Then I Killed My Old Life.

A father’s story of alcoholism, a gun, and a chance at redemption.

There it was. That black shadow with the hissing voice: You’re done. You can’t do this anymore. Some men are winners and then there’s you. Fuck it. End it. Weak words. I don’t mean that they are words of weakness, I mean the words that you are reading on this page are a tiny maggot on the rotten ass of the elephant that was this voice.

I take another swallow of the brown liquid and a shiver lurches through me. As I put the pint-bottle back into my pocket, my mouth waters the way it does when a person might be about to vomit. I open my mouth and let the saliva roll freely over my bottom lip and onto the front of my shirt. I look into the mirror at what I think is me. I blame the sharp lighting in this bathroom for my yellow teeth and the dark, puffy pouches under my nicotine-spit-colored eyes.

I hate myself. Not because I’m a drunk. Not because I shit my pants five-minutes ago and I still haven’t cleaned myself up. No, I hate myself because of the coward in me that needs the drink to function. I hate my fear that other people will see me for what I know that I am. I hate that I’ve ran from things that other men who don’t seem to be too special themselves, have seemingly faced with little difficulty. I hate my unwillingness to try for something more, but I know that it’s all for nothing anyway. Everyone else catches breaks, but not me. I barely feel anything, or I feel too much of everything. There is no in-between.

This is me on the morning of my fortieth birthday, hiding in the bathroom of my house, while my wife and four kids are somewhere on the other side of the door, living their own lives without an inkling that I am contemplating the best way to go to sleep forever.

The thoughts have come and gone in the past three-weeks. That serpent’s lips just behind my ear: *They really will be better off without you. Sure, there will be some pain that goes with losing you, but they’ll get over that. It’s better than the living influence that you have on them now. Hell, one of these days you may end up killing all of you in one drunken car ride. What’s the point of it all? You never follow through with anything. You’ve never won anything. You have no talents. A man should be able to build something. Can you build anything? A man should be able to fix things. Is anything that you touch any better off after you try to mess with it? No.*

This might be a good spot to say something cliché like, “How did I get here?” Or, “How did it all go so wrong?”

But that would be bullshit.

For years I have taken a very specific road that could’ve only led to exactly where I am right now.

I spend every night waking up around 3 a.m., heaving, shaking, and rolling over to clutch whatever bottle I have stashed in the bottom drawer of my nightstand. I violently hold the sloshing bottle against my mouth to spill a couple of slugs down my throat instead of all over my torso. I’m usually good then, to have a smoke and shut my eyes for another two hours before my alarm goes off and it’s time to get ready for work.

Then the day begins…

I sit up and swallow whatever is left of the bottle in my nightstand drawer, and I put the empty pint into my work bag so I can throw it out somewhere on my way to work to avoid the presence of bottles in my trash at home. I shuffle down the hallway into the bathroom and relieve my bladder of its maple-colored contents and make my way to the kitchen.

I pour a cup of coffee and grab two of the four shooters that I have hidden behind the coffee maker. I down the shots using a swallow of coffee as a chaser and bury the empties into the trashcan underneath some used paper plates. I light a cigarette and drop the other two shooters into the pocket of my pajama pants so they will be close at hand when I am in the shower in case I vomit when the hot water and the panicky thoughts about the day ahead hit me. *You’re a fraud. This is NOT how a man acts. How long can you pretend to carry this on?*

Out of the shower and dressed, I brush my teeth making sure it is the last thing I do before I leave the house. (This often makes no difference at all as I may take a shot on my drive into work, in which case I will stop on the backroad on the way in and gargle some of the mouthwash that I keep in the middle console of my truck.)

Every day at the office is a constant act filled with anxiety, shame, and that same voice: *Your last drink was less than two-hours ago. Do you think they can’t smell it on you? Visine might get some of the redness out of your eyes, but they are still puffy and full of fear. You’re not fooling anybody. They’re talking about you in whispers and they think, that you think, that you’re getting away with this. They see you shaking even when you try to camouflage it with other movements , and you can’t deny your oily-red complexion. Trust me, you are not hiding it well.*

I go to the restroom once every two or three-hours, back to the farthest stall from the door, and I guzzle down a shooter or two to quiet some of the nerves and to stave off the inevitable sickness that will come if I do not follow this ritual.

I keep two liquors of choice for the workday:

1. Fireball-a cheap whiskey with a cinnamon flavor, the scent of which I believe I can cover up with Big Red chewing gum.
2. Vodka- most drunks choose willful ignorance in the belief that we can cover up the smell of vodka with just about anything.

Once I have taken my shots in the stall, I put the empty bottles in my pocket, pop some gum or a cough drop, and take care when I walk not to let the empties rattle around and give up my secret. I will make a few trips out to my truck to stash the empties and grab some fresh bottles throughout the day under the guise of grabbing something else such as a pack of smokes or any other excuse I come up with.

The workday having been survived, I start my drive home. I take a two-lane backroad in front of the office that runs parallel to the river where there is a tree-line on one side and a levee on the other. I wait until the office is about the size of a Lego in my rearview mirror and I break out the last two or three shooters and take my first couple of carefree drinks of the day and discard my empty bottles out the window into the tree-line on the roadside.

Lighting a cigarette, inhaling deeply, and exhaling all the stress of the past few hours, I think to myself, *I will drink less tonight and try to get to sleep a little earlier. That way, I’ll have had some decent sleep, even though I’ll wake up somewhere around 3 a.m. again, with my body screaming for a drink.*

I stop at the Pit Stop and grab what I need. A couple of sleeves of shooters and a pint of whiskey should get me through tonight and the workday tomorrow. I make small talk with the cashiers and do my best in the short conversation to act like a regular hard-working guy that is just grabbing some drinks to enjoy casually after work. The clerks are friendly enough, but they know I’m full of shit, and that I’ll be right back in here as soon as I get off tomorrow.

I call my wife on the way home and ask her if she needs anything while I’m out. On the days that she does need me to make a quick stop, I typically use that opportunity to grab a few more drinks, whether it is a half-pint or just a few shooters to rathole somewhere safe should I need them in a pinch. Pulling into my driveway, I pop a cough drop into my mouth and make sure that there are no visible bottles in my truck before going inside.

One of my girls has soccer practice tonight, and my youngest has gymnastics. My wife will take the gymnastics duty, and I agree to take soccer practice since it is held at a fantastic indoor facility that has a bar and grill. I blend in really well there with the majority of parents who also like to have a drink or two while their kid is running around for a couple of hours. It also means that I will not have to worry about reeking like alcohol for the rest of the night as my wife will just chalk it up to me having a couple of drinks at the practice and the few that I will have at home.

Once we are all back at home we have dinner and take our showers. The kids settle into bed, and I pour about three fingers of whiskey into my favorite glass. My wife and I talk to each other about our day and find something to watch on TV for an hour or two. I kiss her goodnight, and shuffle down the hall to the bedroom to lie in bed and scroll on my phone for about an hour before I pass out.

That’s it. Every day is the same.

The only variances may be:

1. Baseball or basketball practice instead of soccer and gymnastics.
2. Clowning around with the kids for a while.
3. House work that I have neglected that I will take too long to finish and no doubt piss and moan the entire time I’m doing it.
4. Me, ruining whatever show or movie we are watching because I am talking about work, or whatever sadness from my past that I choose to dwell on.
5. Sex with my wife instead of walking to bed alone.
6. Us arguing because of my insecurities and her perceived superiority complex.
7. Me damaging one or all of my children’s sense of security when they see their dad acting like a weak child.

I know that I will die a disgusting, humiliating death if I keep going down this road, but I’m not sure that my mind can take another alcohol cleanse. Ridiculously, this is not the first time that I have found myself in the same desperate spot.

I used to detox myself at home a couple of times a year when things would really get out of control. I guess it just got harder on me with age. I’ve added up countless days and nights of sweating, freezing, sickness, shaking my bones out of my skin, and laying in the cool wet swamp of nausea and toxicity. The feel of the sheets was like smearing Crisco all over my body and pulling dirty clothes on top of it. The voice was always there; not as strong or as often as it seems to be more recently, but there. You’re a worm in mud. I try like hell to focus for just ten seconds on one thing, but the horrific thoughts ricochet like seventeen ping-pong balls in my wooden skull. You’ll never be a man. God, the hallucinations! Hearing music coming from the heating vents in the floors and the oscillating fan in my room. Seeing shadows like ooze and smoke crawling around the walls, and rapid glimpses of movements like small birds and insects just in the corner of my eye. Not to mention the unending cycle of shame and anxiety that goes with staying locked in my room, puking in a trash can while my wife is taking on all the responsibilities of running our home by herself.

People think an alcoholic can quit with just a little bit of willpower, but that’s not it. Hell, even most functioning alcoholics think they know how bad it can get, but until they live it, shit…

I carried on with the above-mentioned routines for years until I finally broke down. One night, eight years ago, I resolved to tell my boss the next morning how I had been living and that I may need to take a few days off to get myself together. He took pity on me and consulted with some of the higher-ups of the company, and they secured me a bed at a local rehab facility. I was immediately sent to detox at a hospital before the rehab would even admit me due to my rattling, my yellow eyes, and sky-high blood pressure.

The medications at the hospital helped with the withdrawals a bit. Slowly getting my appetite back and being pumped full of good nutrients and being surrounded by like-minded people with many of the same afflictions, fears and hopes felt like a Godsend. For that moment in time I didn’t feel so isolated and alone. There were many others battling the same issues as me, but despite my low opinion of myself, I still couldn’t help but feel that my situation was just a little different from most of the others’.

When I got home, things went well for about three months. With a new morning routine, practicing mindfulness, and attending AA meetings a few times a week, things seemed to be getting better. I was a better man for my wife and a better father to my kids. For the most part the cravings and ever-existing triggers were still a daily struggle, but I could shake that shit off. *One day at a time.*

Then, I figured, with my newfound wisdom and coping mechanisms, I would be alright to have an occasional drink or two as long as I was doing it at appropriate times. A few drinks at get-togethers, or after work, turned into a few more, turned into a couple of whiskey shots with my coffee in the morning, then a couple more swallows just a few hours later, and so on, and spiral. Things carried on the same way for another six years until I had another breakdown and was fired from my job for “performance and attendance issues”.

That brings us right back to me being hunched over, leaning with both palms on either side of my sink, staring at the golem in the mirror crying, knowing that I am going to kill myself. I thought of driving my truck into the river, hanging myself, or jumping off the nearby bluffs, but I saw a flaw with each one of those methods. *You might not die if you drive into the river. You’re too much of a pussy to hang yourself. Jumping off the bluffs might leave you as a vegetable, but still living.*

A couple of days later, I was about as sick as I’d ever remembered being. I was wobbling like a baby deer and unable to keep any food down. From past experiences I knew that the hospital would be of no help to me as they had refused to admit me before due to smelling like alcohol, or answering “yes” when one of the nurses asked me if I drank more than occasionally. So I went to an Urgent Care located a few blocks from my house, and they looked me over and told me that I had pneumonia. I picked up the steroids and other medications that I was prescribed, mainly to show my wife that I must be legitimately sick if the doctor says I need meds. I went home to pack a bag and to tell my family that I was heading out to my dad’s house in the country to avoid spreading my sickness to them. I backed out of the driveway and drove down my street watching my youngest daughter waving in my rearview and knowing in my soul that I was going to shoot myself in the head back in the woods behind my father’s house.

Since you’re reading this, I guess there’s no need to tell you what I didn’t do. So I’ll tell you what I did. I drove to my dad’s house and talked with him. I told him about my having pneumonia and that I was quitting drinking. Then, I waited until he was out the next day, and I opened the drawer where he kept one of his pistols. I saw that the magazine was missing from the pistol, and I checked for a round in the chamber. I sat and thought for a few long minutes. I wondered if my father had suspected something and if that was why the magazine wasn’t in the pistol as it had been any other time. I thought about my family carrying on without me. I thought about how long I had felt so alone.

I made one phone call. They didn’t answer. I staggered out to the front porch and stared at the field across the road. My phone rang. I spoke honestly and didn’t hold back anything. The voice on the other end didn’t offer much sympathy, but they spoke these simple truths:

1.You’re not alone.

2.You’re isolating yourself, and only you really know why.

3. Even the ones that don’t like you very much right now still love you, and they want you to do better.

4. The ones that don’t want you to do better don’t matter.

5. Nobody that loves you would be better off without you.

6. Stop breaking their hearts, and yours will start to heal as well.

7. It’s not weak to reach for help.

This is my call to the dad out there that may be going through something similar. You, man. Life is brutal, and it doesn’t come with a playbook for rough years. We are supposed to be the protectors and the providers, but when we’re locked inside ourselves, it makes it nearly impossible to give the necessary attention to our outside worlds. We might compare ourselves to our heroes and get stuck on ways that we don’t measure up, but remember that our heroes have their weak moments, too. If you constantly compare your inside to everyone’s outside, you’re gonna see some of the worst of you in contrast with some of the best of others.

I’m not a therapist, a scholar, or an influencer with a podcast. I don’t hold any special degrees or certifications. I’m just a lower-middle class dad throwing this out there in the hopes that it may help somebody somewhere.

If you’re reading this and you’re standing at the same crossroads I was — or you love someone who is — I hope these words help even ONE person choose to kill the old self instead of ending it all. You’re not alone, even when it feels like it.

You matter. Your kids need you. Your wife/partner/family still wants you here, even if they’re too hurt or angry to say it right now. Make the call. Reach out. There’s help, and it’s okay to take it.

You don’t have to be fixed today. You just have to stay.

For most of thatime, things were really good—we communicate well, share similar values, and genuinely enjoy each other’s company. About three months ago, he started opening up more about his mental health. He’d begun therapy for childhood trauma and joined a peer support group. I was supportive—he seemed to be doing real work, and I admired that.

Then he told me about a woman he’d met in the group. He described their connection as a “deep, platonic, emotionally supportive bond” and kept emphasizing that she’s “just an emotional support friend (who happens to be a girl!)”—nothing romantic or sexual, just someone he feels “safe and seen” with. At first, I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. But things got harder to ignore.

They talk almost every day, often late at night, about things like inner child work, emotional regulation, and “relational patterns.” He’s referred to her as his “anchor” and said she “understands his nervous system in a way no one else does”—including me. They’ve gone on multiple one-on-one “grounding walks” (his words), and last month, he canceled a weekend trip we’d planned for months because she was having what he called a “regulation crisis” and “needed his support.”

Last week, he asked if I’d be willing to meet her for coffee—just the three of us—to “build trust” and “normalize the dynamic.” When I said no, he got visibly frustrated. He told me I was “punishing him for healing,” that my discomfort came from “attachment insecurity,” and that jealousy, in his therapist’s words, “isn’t about the other person—it’s about your own unmet needs.” He’s not cheating, he insists. He just needs both of us: me for partnership and stability, her for emotional safety and attunement.

I told him I can’t be in a relationship where someone else—regardless of label—has more emotional access, priority, and intimacy than I do. He says I’m being rigid and fear-based.

I got in, and back in January he asked someone that he works in to sit on his face and they made a plan to meet for coffee. Also more recently he was texting multiple girls hey and flames at 3 in the morning but they never responded.

He also had a message on messenger that was locked with a passcode, which disappeared when he called me asking if I was trying to log into his apps. This person also works with him.

Do I confront him? Do I hold it in? I’m ready to have this child any day, I have no idea what to do. If this baby was not so close I would know exactly what I need to do.

Hi,

I’m a 32F, and my husband is 33. We’ve been married for six years, and ever since we made our relationship official with our families, things have been difficult. It began with jealousy issues and his family not welcoming me in the way I expected. We had major arguments, and I became so stressed that I lost a lot of weight. I didn’t feel able to tell my parents what was happening because I was scared, and I stayed in the relationship partly out of fear that leaving would bring shame to my family or make me unwanted.

Those issues never fully went away, and since getting married, living together, and especially after having children, I am completely exhausted. I’ve always worked full-time, and now we have two boys (4 and 1). I handle about 85% of everything.

* **Household:** cleaning, cooking, shopping, replacing things, paying bills.
* **Car:** insurance, MOT, cleaning, bookings.
* **Nursery/school:** packing bags, paying fees, uniforms.
* **Children:** appointments, clothing, shoes, toys, bathing, bedtime, playing with them.
  Meanwhile, he spends most of his free time on his phone or watching TV, and he does the same with the kids.

I hardly get any time to myself — not even to shower without interruptions. I rarely see my friends, and when I do, it’s usually at home with our kids. My friends often come to our house, and instead of giving us space, he sits with us, which doesn’t make sense to me. I would never sit with his friends if they were here without their wives.

**His personal hygiene is also an issue.** I have to tell him to shower or change because he smells. He wears the same clothes day and night, doesn’t brush his teeth, and often sits with his hands down his pants — even when working from home. I used to buy all his clothes, underwear, socks, etc., but I stopped three months ago.

I also take care of birthdays — even for his family — because he makes no effort.

Whenever his friends invite him out for shisha, he goes, sometimes three times a week. He will leave at 9pm and return around midnight. Meanwhile, I’ve only been out on my own maybe four times in the last four years. If I go anywhere, it’s with or for the kids, never for myself.

I feel like I’m doing everything, and instead of feeling like his partner, I feel like a mother who doesn’t even get the respect he gives his own.

**When we argue, things escalate.**
He has repeatedly said he’ll take me back to my parents or divorce me. Over the last year, he has started threatening to hit me. He gets in my face, shouting, trying to intimidate me. Whenever I try to say I need help or I’m struggling, he says he already does more than my dad and brother and that all of this is just part of being a mother. He tells me I should be grateful for having a house, husband, and kids — what more could I want?

He twists my words constantly. For example, during maternity leave I once said that when I return to work, at least I’ll get to have a quiet cup of coffee. To me he agreed. But to my dad he said that I didn’t want to look after my kids and couldn’t wait to go back to work.

**Other things he has said:**

* That I’m “trying to make him my bitch” because I’m asking for help.
* That I have a “shitty job,” even though I’m a financial analyst and earn only slightly less than him.
* To his manager, in front of me, he said he could “make more money than her in my sleep.”
* He tells me to get a divorce, and then two days later wants to have sex.

He thinks because he contributes more financially to the family that’s it for him. Even though we work the same hours. 

I know I’m not perfect — I get moody — but it’s because I feel invisible. I’m doing so much, and to him it’s just expected. I receive no acknowledgment or appreciation. Now with his threats, I’m scared to even talk to him. I feel like he’s pushed me into silence. Right now, I only speak to him about the boys when necessary.

Lately I’ve been crying on my own and having thoughts about not existing anymore. I don’t want to die, but the thought of escape keeps coming up. The only thing that stops me is knowing my boys need me and wondering who would take care of them if I wasn’t here.

Surely, I am not asking for a lot. I don’t really know what I want from this post. And these are all small snippets and I could sit here and give 100s of examples of things that he’s said or that have happened. We have both lived in the UK pretty much our entire lives, I thought he would think a bit more equal on how we are as a family. 

I guess I don’t know how much I can live like this. But I don’t want to ruin my children’s lives by having a divorce. And all the shame that will bring to my family, I will be the talk of the town in our community. My mum endured a lot in her marriage, and I never understood why she stayed but I get it now “for the kids”. 

Is it selfish to want to be thought about, to want someone to care when they’ve eaten two plates of food and I haven’t been able to eat trying to feed the boys that he thinks one minute let me take them of her for a minute. I want him to make an effort for me, to show me that he wants me as a wife and not as someone that works, raises his children and does everything.

Like a week later, I started hiding booze. Like just stashing a bottle for nightcaps now and then. Well we’d been pretty heavy drinkers, but both stopped successfully when we had our first one. This time I didn’t really stop, just got sneaky. Yeah it feels lame, but I did. Except for some reason when it was sneaky drinking, I just started doing it more and more. To the point where I was sipping something or other all day long, just when I had to go in the office, I’d ride the hangover or bring a little in my coffee. But the point is I’ve been in deep for months now. But sunday night was bad. I’d been hitting the whiskey too hard. My wife was like, “hey you smell like vinegar and you’re slurring, what’s going on.”

Well I came clean, just told her about how much I’ve been secret drinking and she was pretty disappointed, but not entirely surprised.

She’s noticed something off about me, though I might be depressed because we’ve got an open relationship and she accidentally got pregnant by her boyfriend and yeah it’s not ideal but it didn’t make me depressed. She takes the baby over to his house about one a month from Fri night to sun morning, and sometimes just goes over there on her own for date nights. When it’s just me and and my son, I would drink heavy while he played video games. But the rest of the time I was usually just buzzed.

In any case actually explaining myself was so embarrassing and pitiful.

I tapered off with the end of my booze and finished it just over 24 hours ago. I’m feeling like surprisingly present and sharp, it’s very strange. I am just nervous about tomorrow but IWNDWYTHANKSGIVING! can I just like refuse to take alcohol drinks? I’m just probly going to say I’m not feeling good and let that be my fallback.

Hi!

-M20

-Have never had any kind of persistent “up-ness”, but I’ve had my fair share of downs. 

-No family history of Bipolar. -I’m no psychologist, but I am definitely manic (or at least hypomanic) right now. Don’t know for how long, or if there may have been a break in the middle somewhere, because my mood has been kind of unstable recently. It definitely wasn’t absolutely all at once that I started feeling like this, if that helps to clarify. 

-I cannot fathom a possible crash. I won’t accept the possibility. If drinking coffee would prevent this, I’d drink even more, but I’m drinking it mostly for fun now. I didn’t need any to stay up most of last night, for example, and coffee wouldn’t normally do this to me anyway. 

-I hinted at some things to my therapist, but I don’t want to flat out say that I feel this way, because I don’t want to be talked into doing something to try to come down. I’ve never been so self-confident, for example, and I refuse to have that taken from me. I feel angry just thinking about potentially hating myself again in the future. 

-I always tired and rarely sleepy, but now it’s the opposite. My eyes are sleepy from sleeping less, but I’m not worn out on the level of my emotional essence, so to speak. I refuse to be worn out, if that makes sense. 

-I was already an impulsive person, but now I feel so free. I can’t get enough of that. 

-Not looking for advice on how to come down, nor do I intend to romanticize possible mania, but I am looking for some input, especially since this would be my first episode of mania or hypomania (that I’m aware of), and the idea of possibly being bipolar is… interesting to say the least.

[$1500-1800],"My parents are looking for a machine that I (trained barista) can use to make them coffee when I visit, and—once I teach them what I know—to make drinks for themselves and (much more occasionally) guests.

Since they want to potentially use the machine to entertain family and friends, I've ruled out single boiler machines. I have narrowed the choice down between the Lelit Mara X and Elizabeth.

The Elizabeth honestly feels like too much machine for them, both in features and in size. They are not enthusiasts who are going to care about granular temperature control or programmable pre-infusion. (I would personally be pretty excited about the latter as a lever machine user at home, but this is for them!) They also prefer the footprint and aesthetics of the Mara X. So I am leaning towards recommending them that one, and to put the ~$100 price difference toward their grinder.

That said, I want to make sure it won't be limiting to their use case. They don't mind the Mara X's heat up time. But I've seen reviews and chatter about the Mara X's workflow. Can someone who has used the machine let me know if it's likely to provide them problems if multiple guests want milk drinks, especially in succession?

She approached me and we started to connect via text. Met for coffee- had lots in common. It was nice to meet another mom with similar interests. Though we had things in common. Some red flags to note; we went to her house &  it was extremely messy ( my husband and I both felt it was extremely unhinged). Her car was the same: piles and piles of paper work and stuff everywhere. She is routinely angry, she was fired from two of her jobs, she sued and lost.. I tried not to let that cloud my judgement bc life happens and I don’t want to be too hard on her. She has marital issues and I felt she began sharing them way too early.. also I don’t have issues like that as I have a healthy relationship so it was altogether off putting. She truly seems like she may need professional help but I learned this after the dinner where she stiffed me. 

Now to the story I need help figuring out. So, she invited us over to hang out and bring the kids. Her husband ordered pizza from dominoes. I went with her to pick up the order. It took about 30 minutes and that upset her. She began to get really rude to the staff. Snapping at the cashier and demanding loudly that they tell her where her pizzas were. It was so uncomfortable!! In my teens and 20s I worked in coffee shops, so I felt her behavior insanely uncalled for. They comped her pizzas and gave them to her. We got back to the house and I didn’t eat. My husband and children had a slice each. My husband offered to pay the husband half and he told us that the pizzas were comped. A few days later She asked if we could go to dinner one night. She chose a very nice/expensive restaurant in town. We met up and she shopped around town. She bought a few outfits and paid with her phone. We sat for dinner and she proceeded to order: cocktail, expensive entree, appetizer and desert. I ate the same. When the bill came it was about $200. She tried to pay with her phone but the restaurant said no, so she asked for me to put it on my credit card and she would Venmo me. I had no problem with that, as I’ve done that with other friends with no issues. We said goodnight after I paid and I thought I’d send her the receipt in the morning. 
The next day I sent the receipt without the tip and told her “no rush” then I sent my Venmo. She wrote back that she could use the Venmo my husband used to pay her husband for the pizzas from a month earlier… it was so weird but I didn’t want to have drama with her so I said, “ I’m so sorry, we thought the pizza was comped! How embarrassing.” She said she didn’t remember what happened. We went back and forth politely but she insisted that she would pay me but not the tip, as the pizzas were not equal to a $200 meal. Very fair… so anyways… I expected her to Venmo me her share, but she never did. It’s not so much about the money, but I’m so hurt that she did this. Later that night she sent me a text very late at night (weird!) about her husband and his family and the drama she was dealing with.
I really don’t want to cause any drama with this person bc our children are in class together. I have been politely declining to get together again though she has set the stage very well so I feel like she shared a lot of personal stuff and therefore I should be there for her… I think she may be a borderline personality or something. My husband said I got out cheaply… but I feel so sad about this. Am I overreacting about the dinner? Are we “even”bc the pizzas or should i listen to my gut and stay away from this person.

My recruiting results for NG roles ended up being pretty solid. I’m fortunate to be in this position and to have some optionality in a market that was pretty tough.

For context, I chose to only apply to high finance roles. I came from a t30 state school with a 3.8 GPA and had two previous summer internships at two different VCs from early to late stage. I also did two off cycle internships at a boutique IB and a small real estate PE firm.

I started interviewing for roles in early July, and networking was never my strong suit, so it was going to be an uphill battle to land MF PE or BB or EB. I did around 20 to 25 coffee chats over the summer and fall and got along really well with most alumni I spoke to, but I just didn’t grind out enough emails or calls. I had 5 to 6 referrals, but only about 3 actually turned into first round interviews due to extenuating circumstances.

I made a bit of a 180 coming from a VC background and prepped really hard for RX and credit roles. Several of the processes I was in had some type of timed case or modeling test, and I spent hours prepping LBOs, DCFs, and three statement models using YouTube videos. Technicals are relatively easy once you’ve gone through the models. I also knew practically everything in the 400Q guide and RX interview guide cold and spent time going through various other free resources online.

The biggest thing that helped me in interviews was my schedule. I cleared my fall mornings so I could take interviews from 9 am to 12 pm, go in fresh and well rested, and quickly review behaviorals and technicals beforehand. Every first round I failed was one I had to take during lunch breaks at my internship or in between classes, so I stopped doing that altogether. I still had some conflicts with courses and just skipped class and took the hit to attendance and participation.

Mock interviews were also pretty helpful. I had a couple friends working in roles similar to what I wanted and some with return offers, so asking them to listen to my answers and critique my story, explanations, or tone was useful. I probably did 6 to 8 mocks.

I ended up accepting an offer from a MM PE fund doing buyout and special sits credit and turned down an offer from a relatively well known MM bank and a LMM investment bank. Funnily enough, I didn’t know anyone at any of the firms I got offers from.

Also happy to answer any questions around comp, expected hours, process differences between IB, VC, and PE or anything else.",2,1764193066.0,FinancialCareers,2,1.0,False

1p7kaim,https://i.redd.it/hy71zoon7o3g1.jpeg,Another one with a very long description from my dream journal (TW: very descriptive stabbing/slicing),"I was in my grandmother’s house, on the second floor. A group of girls was there, about my age, if not a little older. They were all preppy girls that all went to the room at the end of the hall for some reason unknown to me. They were all joyful and energetic. I didn’t know them. I stood near the entrance. The girl was paying no attention to me, which I was fine with. I approached the black sofa, then suddenly stopped when I found a large, long-limbed version of Grimace (yes, the McDonald’s mascot), lying on the floor between the coffee table and the sofa, the corners of his mouth were curled downward in a frown, and his eyes were completely shut. He showed no sign of life. This was obviously out of the ordinary, but I showed no sign of shock. There was a small knife on the kitchen counter, and for no reason at all I went up to Grimace with this knife, stuck the whole blade in his body, and just as quickly took it back out, leaving a 2.5 inch deep hole right in the middle of his torso. I then turned the knife sideways in my hand, and I slid it across where I had to imagine his neck would be, the purple, synthetic cloth skin separating between the sliver. Even after all I had just done to him, no liquids of any kind came out of either slit. While the knife dragged along his throat, I felt a phantom tickle along mine, as if a ghost were trying to do the same to me. I took a few steps away, with the knife still in my hand, and stood, pacing around the other side of the room in complete silence, other than my footsteps. About 10 minutes later, the group of preppy girls comes out, all giggling and squealing and chatting loudly. I remained, pacing around the other side of the room, when I hear a shocked & fearful shriek. I turned towards the direction it came from, and a skinny white girl with blond hair from the group was looking down, with a petrified expression on her face. She looked away from the scene and up to me, knowing I was the culprit. Last thing I remember was me, just walking to another room with the knife still in my hand, and the group of girls now following me, hurling threats and slurs my way.

There were plenty of results but I noticed there were no Starbucks in the results, and I was sure there must be some locations around.

Out of curiosity, I made a number of searches for various iterations of coffee: coffee near me, coffee house, etc. None of these searches included any Starbucks locations. 

The same behavior happens whether I am logged into my account, it searching when not logged into an account.

This caused me to wonder if this behavior is intentional. I know in the past searching for coffee in Maps would include Starbucks locations among the results.

1p7k8tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/1p7k8tn/teach_by_doing_for_npcs_would_be_amazing/,'Teach By Doing' for NPCs would be amazing!,"The ['Autonauts' series](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Denki) has a ['teach by doing' system](https://youtu.be/004ou48vd6U?t=953) which would be **perfect** for 7D2D to add easily-understood, believable automation by hiring NPCs to take on various tasks.  

Want someone to craft weapons?  Show them how to gather the materials from storage, craft them, then store them in the armoury.  (And then tweak the instructions to make sure that they don't take \*ALL\* of the materials, only make a certain amount of that weapon, etc.)

Want someone to walk a patrol?  Show them how to take a weapon out of the armoury, then mark the waypoints you want them to travel between.  

TFP would only have to create a limited number of basic actions/instructions/etc., then allow the players to create their *own* NPC AI from them.

One mechanism Autonauts has is limiting the number of instructions each bot can have, so you can't have a single bot do everything, which would spoil the game.  7D2D NPCs could have an 'IQ' which is a permanent limiting factor, and a 'wage' which sets a variable limit  (i.e. pay an NPC more and it will be willing to do more.

One mechanism it *doesn't* have is interrupts.  This is vitally important in 7D2D where changing situations require changing what you are doing.  For example, an NPC might have to stop crafting in order to defend the base from a wandering horde attack.

I would even have these 'tasks' be assignable to a player's character.  For example, a player might say to her crew, ""Hey, guys, I need to go take a bio-break and make some coffee.  I'll leave my character cooking food and putting it away while I'm gone.""

Then one day I was scrolling through Instagram and Delan’s profile popped up the same Delan Lisa used to obsess over during her college years and I sent a simple hi not expecting anything and he replied in two minutes and one coffee turned into dinner and dinner turned into weeks and weeks melted into three months and then one night under soft lights and a nervous hush he confessed that he had always liked me

We started dating in secret quietly carefully and for eight months I kept him hidden from the world especially from Lisa not because I was ashamed but because I wasn’t ready to lose another part of my life to her

Then Thanksgiving arrived

I walked into the house holding Delan’s hand my first time ever bringing someone home for the holidays and the room froze before bursting into excitement my aunt squealing my grandma nearly dropping her plate and then I saw Lisa her face draining the instant she saw us she excused herself and disappeared into the bathroom ten minutes passed then fifteen until I finally went to knock

She opened the door with mascara streaks down her cheeks her breath sharp her eyes raw with betrayal and she choked out you stole him you stole my crush

And for a moment I just looked at her this girl who had spent her entire life copying me taking from me rewriting my story as hers and I finally said the truth I had swallowed for years now you know how it feels

I didn’t yell I didn’t argue I just let the words settle between us like a mirror she couldn’t escape and then I walked away

Back at the table Delan kissed my forehead whispered something that made me laugh and called me love while Lisa sat across from us silently staring at the one thing she had never been able to take from me

That night changed everything and after that Thanksgiving Lisa stopped competing stopped copying stopped showing up to family events and for the first time in my life my story finally belonged to me

My husband (40) and I (39) have 3 kids. We live 200 miles from my parents. We’ve recently bought our own home and moved out of my parent’s rental. My mother is toxic. When she stays with us she makes comments about our keeping the house clean and our parenting. Taking it upon herself to clean what we have literally just cleaned and even parenting our children. While we are in the room. This has gone on for years. This is all relevant. She was just at my new house for 2 weeks. It was only supposed to be 1 but she decided on her own that she would stay. Now, here is where it went bad. 

I made a comment about not leaving an empty trash bag in the middle of the floor because I didn’t want my kids to trip over it. I had just watched my 2 year actively trip over it. She made a snippy comment about not caring about her safety. I let it go. She then went into the kitchen and kept muttering under her breath. I walked by and she yelled at me for being nosey when she was talking to herself. It spiraled from there. After a few minutes of yelling at each other she picked up a coffee cup and was going to full on football throw it at me. I didn’t know my 2 year old was in the room, but she did. That’s when I kicked her out. At 8 o’clock at night. I didn’t care. 

Fast forward to the next day, she and my dad came back to “talk”. All she did was deflect, never taking responsibility for her actions or words. She said things like “you don’t cook enough dinner to feed your kids because you’re dirt poor!” Which isn’t true. We have leftovers every night. 

After the talk, we let her stay. It again snowballed. With her constantly badmouthing my husband to me. Then getting mad when I took his side. 

Fast forward another few days. She was in her own home and called MY FRIEND. To talk crap about us. She said how dirty we are and that we are ruining our children. She said my youngest would grow up to be a thug, my daughter will be 15, pregnant and strung out on drugs and my oldest will get beat up every day in school. 

I lost it. I called and told them that are never welcome in my home again. That I’m done with their toxic bs. She demanded family heirlooms back. So I am happily obliging and leaving those and everything else they’ve ever given me in their empty home. 

My question now is: WIBTAH if I continue to let my children see them? Or WIBTAH if I cut them off from my kids? ",9,1764192795.0,AITAH,14,0.92,False

1p7k0gz,https://i.redd.it/n7sqvw5f5o3g1.png,Reunion,"As his test tube opens, Denis falls to the ground with a thud. He quickly clutches his abdomen and looks down at his lower half, surprised to find it re-attached to his body and completely functional. He looks around the laboratory filled with test tubes with people inside. He recognizes some of them. They were killed in combat rather brutally, but their bodies seemed to be in pristine condition, much like his own. He looks back at the test tube he fell out of in shock. Before he could stand up and question the researchers and scientists, a loud explosion followed by dust and debris falling from the ceiling erupted, sending anyone standing down to the ground. Denis looks around, finding that the laboratory had erupted in flames and smoke, alarms blaring almost obnoxiously. Denis attempts to stand and flee, but gets trampled by people as the other tubes open, letting more and more people out.

“Get out of here! Go, GO!!” a researcher says in a panic.

“Run far away from this place if you want to live!” another one says.  
Denis watches as rubble collapses from the ceiling, crushing subjects attempting to flee. Some of them were in flames. Denis was unsure if he’d make it out in one piece. Then, Denis started recollecting his memories. Memories of Nadya. He knew that he had to survive this ordeal if he wanted to see Nadya again. Was Nadya still alive? He was unsure, but he was worried sick about her regardless. Denis sprints toward the hallways as the laboratory room explodes. Denis throws himself down for cover, narrowly avoiding death. He gets back up as he begins traversing through the countless hallways. Each room he passes through was much like his. A large room filled with countless large tubes holding people. In each room were multiple researchers and scientists working together to open each tube and release the revived Agents. Denis continues traversing the hallways of the facility, looking for a way out. This place was unfamiliar to him. As he aimlessly around each hallway, he finally makes his way to a stairwell. Next to the stairwell was an injured researcher.

“Y-You..! Go up this stairwell!” the researcher said.

“What about you?” said Denis.

“Just.. leave me! I probably won’t make it much longer anyway, so just go! Save yourself!” the man said back to Denis. Denis pondered about leaving him, but ultimately brought the man up and wrapped the man’s arms around his shoulders to help him walk.

“W-What are you doing?! You’re going to get yourself killed if you help me!” Denis knew the researcher was right. Helping this man would be inconvenient for Denis’ own survival. But nonetheless, he helped him. Not only did he need a guide, but he also knew that this researcher likely had a family waiting for him back at home. He couldn’t live with himself if he let the man die. Perhaps he got that from Nadya? 

Halfway up the stairwell, the two ran into a problem. Going forward was no longer a viable option; rather, it was a very dangerous option. The stairs leading up had crumbled and erupted in flames. They knew that they had to find another way. Luckily, the researcher had been in this complex numerous times and knows routes to more stairwells. But first, they’d have to traverse through yet another set of hallways filled with panic and chaos. Denis noticed something peculiar down the hallway. He saw Carol-Ann, and S ranked Agent, slaughtering anyone without mercy in her path. What is this? Denis had no time to think as Carol-Ann spotted them and advanced toward them in a slow and menacing way. It was clear that she wasn’t after Denis, but after the researcher. Denis quickly grabbed the man and sprinted down the hall, entering a room. It seemed to be a break room. Denis closes the door and starts scanning for a way out. That’s when Denis notices an air vent and helps the researcher inside of it.

“I-I will crawl and meet you at the stairwell!”

“Where is the stairwell at?” Denis asked.

“You’ll need to pass that scary woman and continue walking down that hallway. Then, you will need to take two rights and then a left. Continue going down that hallway and you’ll see it!” the man hastily said.

“Okay. Now, hurry! Crawl before she finds you!” Denis told the man. The thought of Carol-Ann finding him scared him deeply as he starts crawling through the air vents. Denis rushes toward the hallway and takes a turn. He is then stopped by Carol-Ann. She stands in front of him, a cold and dangerous aura emitting from her.

“Tell me where that man went.” she said, coldly and threatening.

“If you want to see Nadya again, then I advise you to tell me.” she threatens. Nadya? This sparks a bit of hope in Denis.

“Nadya.. Is she alive?!” Denis asks the woman. Rather than answering him, she steps closer to him in an intimidating manner.

“A-Ah, sorry! I’m not quite sure where he went, but he ran off without me down that hallway.” Denis lies. Carol-Ann starts to walk past him.

“Nadya will be waiting for you.” the woman whispered to him before charging down the hall. Denis watches as the air vent collapses and the man falls right in front of Carol-Ann. He can do nothing but watch as the man begs for life before being mercilessly killed. Denis looks away from the sight, feeling terrible. He felt as if he led the man to his death, even if unintentionally. It doesn’t matter anymore. Denis must find a way out of here alive. He takes a right, then another right, then finally a left into the stairwell. Denis climbs the stairwell and makes it into the lobby of the facility, where more dangers lurk. The lobby is a total mess–blood is splattered everywhere and fires are raging. Denis spots the exit and rushes through it. When making it outside, Denis feels relieved. Now his next step was to find Nadya, but he was unsure where she could be. Rather than trying to search for Nadya, he let their reunion up to fate. He believed that the two would meet again sooner or later.

A few weeks after STATIC had collapsed and all Agents were free, Denis decided to enjoy his free time by going to the cafe Nadya and he always enjoyed going to. As he was enjoying a coffee in the early morning, something caught his eye. A woman with white, short hair and tall, black, decorated horns. Bingo! He quickly follows behind her and taps her shoulder. She freezes, before turning around and spotting him. She instantly freezes. She looks like she had just seen a ghost.

“Hey, Nadya! Guess who’s back!\~” Denis teased lightly. Nadya says nothing, her arms slowly coming down to rest on her sides. 

“D.. D-Denis..? Is that.. Really you..?” Nadya asks hesitantly.

“Of course it’s me, Nadya,” he replies. Then, Nadya lunges forward and pulls Denis in a tight hug, almost as if she never wanted to let go. Denis hugs her back gently, caressing the back of her head.

“Shh, it’s okay. I’m here now,” Denis tells Nadya in a reassuring and soft voice.",4,1764192363.0,STATICLore,1,1.0,False

1p7jy7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalIncomePath/comments/1p7jy7q/2_methods_for_creating_digital_income/,2 Methods for creating Digital Income,"For context, I have made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling digital products.

But I recently started promoting a few, higher-profit margin physical products - and the conversions are much better.

This is due to, in my opinion, primarily to the fact that the quality of affiliate programs and innovative physical products has really become much better.

And that fact that people actually WANT these products. There is no ""make money"" benefit, and that really does help with conversions.

So the question is - what is the best way to start selling physical products.

Obviously, you want an edge.

So here are two methods you might want to test.

**Option One: Create a short digital report.** This should focus on solving an actual problem that people are willing to spend money on. This could be anything. You'll be amazed at the amount and calibre of products you will find.

You can create this and sell it on your own cart, like [Zylvie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ1RH9K1jSM) or Gumroad or Buy Me A Coffee.

**Option Two: Build a hyper-niche directory site on a very specific topic.** A lot of people think of these directory sites as a ""local"" directory. While you can build that, I've found building one around products is really good. Google understands what the site is about, and it keeps it highly focused on a topic—unlike a general blog.

The platforms available to do this are different than a couple years ago - much easier to use if you (like me) are fed up with the bugginess of WordPress.

Best advice: pick something you actually have interest in - vs just what you think will make money.

It makes the build so much more enjoyable.

I have a guide on how to set up a directory site I created while I was doing my own research. [You can grab it for free here](https://www.digitalabc.net/directory).

Yes, because I would just tell you about my hobbies and that I love trees.

So yes I love nature and where I am there's plenty of nice places to explore so I love it here (and also I feel like there's an invisible thread weaved by precious cultural heritage that's keeping me tethered to this country) but I would definitely relocate to be with the right person.

And yes introductions are hard because of the dreaded ""what do you do for a living?"" I'm unemployed due to chronic illness (I'm open to speaking about it in DMs). I do pick up freelance projects every once in a while but for the most part I'm a good old unemployed person with more or less stable symptoms now but unable to work still. Hopefully one day as I'm recovering.

Some of my hobbies include: Reading, painting, hiking and talking walks in nature (again, trees), scrapbooking and photography. I also like swimming, and going to bookstores and coffeeshops. 

More on trees: I didn't realize this until recently, which  is strange for my big age. I have to be around trees. I feel a bit blue when I'm somewhere I can't look around or out of the window and see a tree or a mountain in the distance.

Things that make me happy:

• A good cup of coffee and/or some yummy food

• Sleep

• When a conversation is going well and all participants are feeling warm and content

• Books obviously (I'm incredibly blessed to be able to read in three languages so it feels like I'll never not find a book I want to read) 

• Walks

• The sea. A cup of tea or swimming or laying down reading a book in the beach. And snow. Just playing with snow

• Thrift stores 

• Museums and historical sites

I'm politically left leaning. I'm Muslim, and would prefer my partner to be Muslim as well. I'm looking for a companion, someone to make me laugh, someone to inspire and be inspired by. I appreciate curiosity, initiative and kindness. 

Is there more about me to discover? Well yes of course! But I'm going to stop here and leave the rest for the curious",2,1764191910.0,r4r,1,0.75,False

2 1/2 months ago, I (26F) started seeing this guy (24M). I already knew him before we started seeing each other romantically. But when he started showing interest, he came on pretty strong despite being a more shy person. We hit it off instantly and grew very close in a very short amount of time. I’m a little embarrassed about how short. He would say things like “I want to build a future with you” and “ you are my perception of a perfect woman” but he wasn’t all words. He was action too. After a month, one night spent sleeping over turned into many nights. Everything was great. He was kind and thoughtful and communicated well and didn’t have me doubting his feelings for me. And to how I saw him this was all a genuine “I’m wearing my heart on my sleeve and I don’t care if I get burned” kind of a way. Not a love-bombing narcissistic sort of way. (I have been there before)

By the time we got to a month and a half it felt like we were in a relationship without the label. But just before the end of our second month, everything started feeling off. The first time I asked him, he said it was just stress with all of his other things going on. I planned a birthday surprise for him. I decorated his apartment a little, cooked his favorite hometown snack, and had a present full of other smaller presents, waiting for him on the dining room table. I also did my makeup and dressed cute for when he showed up. His reaction was lukewarm, and he never opened my gifts. The next night I asked him again what was going on and he basically told me he couldn’t see me anymore because everything was feeling very overwhelming, and the stress and depression was getting to him. He also said he “thought he was ready”. Being with me also had him fall out of his gym routine that helps him manage those feelings, despite in the beginning, I actually invited him to come to the gym with me a few times and he knows he could always talk to me. But he also said that sometimes he would just want to come home and be by himself or cry. He also knew that I was okay with seeing each other less instead of every day and I suggested it many times too. Despite this, he reassured me that it didn’t have anything to do with me or us. I had everything to do with everything else.

I cried a lot, but ultimately, I told him I understand and I took a step back the best I could. A week later he invited me over, which gave me a lot of relief and confusion at the same time. All my stuff was still there. My toothbrush, my coffee pods he doesn’t even like, my coffee creamer that he would never use, the balloons I got him for his birthday, he put his keys on the keychains I bought/made for him. I spent a lot of time between the split and then anxious and overthinking and worrying if I was talking to him too much or if too much space was going to create distance. And being in his place seeing all my stuff was like I could finally exhale and have some clarity of where I stood without him even saying a word. After that though we still talked, but I could feel his texts getting more dull and having more time between them.

I decided maybe he needed more space than what I was giving him because it felt like his responses were to be polite or they were a chore. I understand that depression can make people not realize how much time is passing. Or maybe he was afraid of disappointing me. I don’t know. But I felt like I was bleeding out, so I thought let me just allow him to be the next one to initiate. Three days of silence went by. And on the third night, I went to the bar that we always go to and saw him there with another girl, and him holding her leg. I didn’t say anything or cause a scene because that’s not who I am, but it really hurt.

I asked him about it today and he said that they’re just “talking” and it’s very new and he wasn’t looking to get with anyone but it happened out at the blue and there was an instant connection. We’re gonna talk about it in person at a later time.

I know I invested a lot into this emotionally, and trust me I know I feel crazy for getting attached so fast. But he made it feel so safe. And he’s someone that I truly want to be with and adore as a person, not just as potential (at least I was certain before he shutdown). I know that we’re technically both single. But I didn’t think he’d be out pursuing another connection in a shared space we both frequent when he told me that he needed space for other reasons. I know what kind of man he is and I have no doubt that he’s never lied to me about his feelings or whatever is happening with this other woman. He’s open to talking in person and doesn’t seem like he has anything to hide. He also turned his location back on this morning which I find super weird and suspicious.

But I just want to know if anyone thinks this is even worth pursuing later if he tries to spin the block. I know I won’t be showing up the same if I do. And he wouldn’t have a lot to prove 

tl;dr; very genuinely wonderful man I saw a future with got stressed and overwhelmed with life once reality hit. He told me he needed space to get himself together, and assured it had nothing to do with his feelings for me. I gave him space even though it was sending my nervous system into overdrive. Then less than 3 weeks later I find out he’s “talking” with someone else. He isn’t hiding or standoffish. I just don’t know if I can have anything solid with him after this.",2,1764191799.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

**Notes:**

I found all flight prices on Google Flights today. Prices can change daily. I tried to estimate the costs for a standard rooms at the listed hotels. Over the years, I have built a directory of places I find interesting.

In the future, I might add an estimated total cost, but for now in my head I think you can do a back of the napkin estimate of flight cost + hotel per night + a buffer of \~$80-$150/day (depending on the city) for food, Ubers, and fun to get a picture of the total trip cost. 

I know a a lot of the times you have to piece together this information yourself and it can take forever. I personally love researching different locations and where my next trip is going to be and would love to share this more frequently or in a different format if people are finding this helpful!",24,1764191791.0,Charlotte,3,0.93,False
1p7jr6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/LeavingAcademia/comments/1p7jr6r/the_guilt_has_rendered_me_a_statue/,The guilt has rendered me a statue.,"I spent my whole life wanting to teach. Once upon a time, I wanted to teach high school, and later on, college teaching became the aim (specifically something with a high teaching emphasis, as I was not especially in pursuit of research glory... though I wouldn't have been against it, I'd sooner leave it to others with a passion for it). My plans came to fruition over a decade ago, starting with adjuncting, later becoming full-time teaching elsewhere. Once upon a time, this was what I *really* wanted to do.

Although there are still positives that I remain quite grateful for, I feel out of place where I live, and have been wound down by a number of factors: the toll of the stress on my health (including some medical issues I did not previously have), the AI epidemic, internal factors at my current institution (environmental hazards, politics)... in short, I'm on a fast food and coffee diet as a coping mechanism.

*On AI: I estimate that 30-50% of the students in a higher-level course are using AI for either their entire papers or close to all of them (with minor paraphrasing). If I gently ask a student if they are using AI (not accusing them, but simply asking), I tend to receive nasty remarks back that merit not just academic integrity inquiries, but behavior intervention reports. I have also had to call security due to a student who got in my face and attempted to intimidate me (this same student would later be restrained for attempting to physically fight another person on campus. Yay).*

I'm not new to dripping sarcastic remarks/false enthusiasm about course material, the 'I'm going to rate you on RateMyProfessors' shenanigans, what a lot of my colleagues call 'the  Zoomer stare', needing to integrate remedial skills training into high-level courses, checking and responding to e-mails 24/7 (including holidays), receiving bizarre requests from deans with the subject line of 'Concern' (including being told to travel 600 miles in 2 days in the middle of a Summer, even though my contract does not inherently include Summers), college administration breaking the faculty contract and practically asking for frivolous lawsuits, support interactions with expensive textbook publishers whose servers don't stay up and will abandon you once they have your money, watching my fellow faculty (and myself) get sick and involuntarily put on lots of weight as we cope, being asked to SMS students I've been assigned to as an advisor reminding them to pay for their courses (can't  say I'm comfortable with that task)...

The short is that I really *want* out, but there are a few factors stopping me. The most pressing being that I *genuinely care about my colleagues, as well as the students who need someone*. It has been made clear to me that no one else in my department wants to teach the courses that I do. They don't have anyone who is ready and willing to do it, and for the first time ever they are having struggles finding part-time profs.

It isn't about the money. My current salary is fine, though due to the high cost of living I'd likely net more money in many other places. Nobody's relying on me for money or health insurance, and I don't have a mortgage (just a super-expensive apartment that I'm mostly fine with, but I really wish I was in a lower cost of living area). My family would be pleased if I got out of here and moved back home, and I've saved up enough money that it'd be awhile before the urgency kicked in to find a job 'or else'.

*Would I be vile for walking away under these circumstances*? I don't want to do anyone wrong. I got into this profession to help people, but I'm not sure how much longer I can tolerate it.",3,1764191742.0,LeavingAcademia,2,1.0,False

I'm currently experiencing some issues, and could you help me with them? I ordered 1,000 Eisenia fetida worms three weeks ago to make my own worm compost, and they arrived with bedding. I placed them in the box I'd prepared. I waited two days for them to acclimate to the bedding, then added a mixture of apple pulp, tea and coffee grounds, and cardboard. The apple pulp had skins and I think it was a bit too moist. However, I thought my worms liked it because they ate the food and didn't seem to escape at all. When I measured the humidity in the bedding, it was usually high, but the surface of the bedding was dry, so I didn't add any water. Last week, a week after their arrival, I added food again, the same way, except I removed the skins from the apple pulp and cut the cardboard into tiny pieces. Two days later, when I opened my worm bin, I found it full of white mites, and I was very worried. I checked it constantly throughout the day and noticed my worms trying to escape. So I separated the food I'd added and moved it to a different bin. Thinking the problem was humidity, I moved the worm bedding to a different box and noticed small white worms on the floor. My research revealed that humidity was the cause of the small worms and mites. So, I ventilated the box from both the top and bottom for two days. During this time, the mite population decreased significantly, and the worms stopped trying to escape. Since they had no food and hadn't fed for three or four days, I thought they had been starving for a long time, so I added a food mixture consisting of tea and coffee grounds, not apple pulp. The next day, I noticed the surface was dry and slightly white. Initially, I attributed this to dryness and sprayed the worms with water to moisten them. Later that day, when I saw the worms crawling on the surface, I thought they might be hungry. Since I wouldn't be able to monitor them for two days, I added some food. I added the remaining food of apple pulp, cardboard, tea, and coffee grounds I had prepared earlier. Two days later, I opened the lid and noticed the surface was white. Again, I attributed this to dryness and stirred the bedding a bit. But the next day, I encountered a bigger problem. I realized that the whiteness was mold. I noticed some of my worms were drying up and dying white. I've been dealing with this since Monday. I realized the reason my worms were drying up and dying white was due to a buildup of nitrogen gas. I wanted to remove the mold today. However, since I had previously removed the food I was feeding, the bedding had diminished. Since I didn't know it was mold, I stirred it up first, and the mold had spread further down. Unfortunately, I also noticed red mites during this process. Today, I removed the worms that had died this way and removed the larger molds. I also made sure the box was well-ventilated from both the top and bottom. I stirred the bedding a bit and noticed my worms hiding in one corner. There were white where they weren't hiding. I removed them from there. I fluffed the bedding to give them some air, and after a while, I noticed my dazed worms starting to move. I placed damp pieces of cardboard on the bedding as an escape route so they could escape, but they never went there. I don't know what to do or how to proceed. My worms are very stressed and want to escape. I'm also very stressed because I can't find a solution. Can you help me figure out how to proceed and how to get them to love their boxes again?

I read and hear a lot about how other people with autism struggle with not being able to work, but I find that I am on the opposite end of the spectrum..

I work 6 days a week and it still does not feel like enough. When I am working it quietens a part of my brain because I am focused on the task at hand rather than overthinking about other stuff. I also rely on routine and when I am on my day off I feel like I don't know what to do with myself and that I should be doing something and it makes me uncomfortable. I am masking most of the time I am working (my Sunday job is in a coffee shop dealing with customers and my Monday-Friday job is working in a small team with some loud noise) which can feel really frustrating and makes me want to isolate myself once I get home, but overall I am satisfied with my arrangement of working 6 days a week.. I also want to make a decent amount of money to put into savings so this motivates me

If I lived alone, I would probably work 7 days a week.. I still live at home (20F) and my mum already thinks I work way too much and she would be pissed off if I was to work 7 days a week, which is why I don't do it already

Before he could stand up and question the researchers and scientists, a loud explosion followed by dust and debris falling from the ceiling erupted, sending anyone standing down to the ground. Denis looks around, finding that the laboratory had erupted in flames and smoke, alarms blaring almost obnoxiously. Denis attempts to stand and flee, but gets trampled by people as the other tubes open, letting more and more people out.

“Get out of here! Go, GO!!” a researcher says in a panic.

“Run far away from this place if you want to live!” another one says.  
Denis watches as rubble collapses from the ceiling, crushing subjects attempting to flee. Some of them were in flames. Denis was unsure if he’d make it out in one piece. Then, Denis started recollecting his memories. Memories of Nadya. He knew that he had to survive this ordeal if he wanted to see Nadya again. Was Nadya still alive? He was unsure, but he was worried sick about her regardless. Denis sprints toward the hallways as the laboratory room explodes. Denis throws himself down for cover, narrowly avoiding death. He gets back up as he begins traversing through the countless hallways. Each room he passes through was much like his. A large room filled with countless large tubes holding people. In each room were multiple researchers and scientists working together to open each tube and release the revived Agents. Denis continues traversing the hallways of the facility, looking for a way out. This place was unfamiliar to him. As he aimlessly around each hallway, he finally makes his way to a stairwell. Next to the stairwell was an injured researcher.

“Y-You..! Go up this stairwell!” the researcher said.

“What about you?” said Denis.

“Just.. leave me! I probably won’t make it much longer anyway, so just go! Save yourself!” the man said back to Denis. Denis pondered about leaving him, but ultimately brought the man up and wrapped the man’s arms around his shoulders to help him walk.

“W-What are you doing?! You’re going to get yourself killed if you help me!” Denis knew the researcher was right. Helping this man would be inconvenient for Denis’ own survival. But nonetheless, he helped him. Not only did he need a guide, but he also knew that this researcher likely had a family waiting for him back at home. He couldn’t live with himself if he let the man die. Perhaps he got that from Nadya? 

Halfway up the stairwell, the two ran into a problem. Going forward was no longer a viable option; rather, it was a very dangerous option. The stairs leading up had crumbled and erupted in flames. They knew that they had to find another way. Luckily, the researcher had been in this complex numerous times and knows routes to more stairwells. But first, they’d have to traverse through yet another set of hallways filled with panic and chaos. Denis noticed something peculiar down the hallway. He saw Carol-Ann, and S ranked Agent, slaughtering anyone without mercy in her path. What is this? Denis had no time to think as Carol-Ann spotted them and advanced toward them in a slow and menacing way. It was clear that she wasn’t after Denis, but after the researcher. Denis quickly grabbed the man and sprinted down the hall, entering a room. It seemed to be a break room. Denis closes the door and starts scanning for a way out. That’s when Denis notices an air vent and helps the researcher inside of it.

“I-I will crawl and meet you at the stairwell!”

“Where is the stairwell at?” Denis asked.

“You’ll need to pass that scary woman and continue walking down that hallway. Then, you will need to take two rights and then a left. Continue going down that hallway and you’ll see it!” the man hastily said.

“Okay. Now, hurry! Crawl before she finds you!” Denis told the man. The thought of Carol-Ann finding him scared him deeply as he starts crawling through the air vents. Denis rushes toward the hallway and takes a turn. He is then stopped by Carol-Ann. She stands in front of him, a cold and dangerous aura emitting from her.

“Tell me where that man went.” she said, coldly and threatening.

“If you want to see Nadya again, then I advise you to tell me.” she threatens. Nadya? This sparks a bit of hope in Denis.

“Nadya.. Is she alive?!” Denis asks the woman. Rather than answering him, she steps closer to him in an intimidating manner.

“A-Ah, sorry! I’m not quite sure where he went, but he ran off without me down that hallway.” Denis lies. Carol-Ann starts to walk past him.

“Nadya will be waiting for you.” the woman whispered to him before charging down the hall. Denis watches as the air vent collapses and the man falls right in front of Carol-Ann. He can do nothing but watch as the man begs for life before being mercilessly killed. Denis looks away from the sight, feeling terrible. He felt as if he led the man to his death, even if unintentionally. It doesn’t matter anymore. Denis must find a way out of here alive. He takes a right, then another right, then finally a left into the stairwell. Denis climbs the stairwell and makes it into the lobby of the facility, where more dangers lurk. The lobby is a total mess–blood is splattered everywhere and fires are raging. Denis spots the exit and rushes through it. When making it outside, Denis feels relieved. Now his next step was to find Nadya, but he was unsure where she could be. Rather than trying to search for Nadya, he let their reunion up to fate. He believed that the two would meet again sooner or later.



A few weeks after STATIC had collapsed and all Agents were free, Denis decided to enjoy his free time by going to the cafe Nadya and he always enjoyed going to. As he was enjoying a coffee in the early morning, something caught his eye. A woman with white, short hair and tall, black, decorated horns. Bingo! He quickly follows behind her and taps her shoulder. She freezes, before turning around and spotting him. She instantly freezes. She looks like she had just seen a ghost.



“Hey, Nadya! Guess who’s back!\~” Denis teased lightly. Nadya says nothing, her arms slowly coming down to rest on her sides. 

“D.. D-Denis..? Is that.. Really you..?” Nadya asks hesitantly.

“Of course it’s me, Nadya,” he replies. Then, Nadya lunges forward and pulls Denis in a tight hug, almost as if she never wanted to let go. Denis hugs her back gently, caressing the back of her head.

“Shh, it’s okay. I’m here now,” Denis tells Nadya in a reassuring and soft voice.

1p7jjbf,https://i.redd.it/mqqt35ev1o3g1.jpeg,If you are struggling to heal this is for you,"(It has proven to work for women too)

A quick disclaimer, this content is informational content, based on my experience not just a chatgpt post, but I did use Ai to fix any errors I might have made.

After the disclaimer I want to start with saying If you're here, it's not by accident. You're searching for something the usual advice hit the gym, get your money up is missing. That advice isn't wrong, it's just incomplete. It focuses on the external shell while the internal structure is still damaged.

This isn't about winning the breakup. This is about winning back yourself.

First, Let's Name the Pain

What you're going through isn't a minor inconvenience. It's a form of emotional withdrawal.

You were addicted to a person. The texts, the inside jokes, the future plans, the physical presence your brain was wired for a consistent hit of them. Now, the supply is cut off. The withdrawal symptoms are real: the anxiety, the obsessive thoughts, the emptiness, the physical ache in your chest.

This isn't weak. This is human neurobiology. Acknowledging this is your first act of strength.

The Four Stages of Withdrawal (And How to Navigate Them)

Forget vague phases. Here is your field guide.

Stage 1: The Shock & The ""Scale""

You’re numb,then you’re logical. You try to weigh everything on a scale: ""Well, she was great, but we fought about X. I was bad at Y, but she was critical of Z."" This is your mind's attempt to create order from chaos.

· Your Mission Here: Information Diet. Stop analyzing the past. Your brain is a courtroom with a biased judge and no evidence. The case is closed. Do not check her social media. Do not re-read old texts. This is like picking a scab and wondering why it won't heal. Your only job is to survive the day. Eat. Hydrate. Breathe.

Stage 2: The Ache & The ""Red-Tinted Glasses""

The logic fades and the full weight of the loss hits.Everything is a trigger. A song, a smell, a street corner. The world is covered in a film of her. This isn't love anymore; it's the ghost of it.

· Your Mission Here: Reclaim Your Territory. This is active, not passive. That restaurant you loved? Go there with a friend and order something you never got with her. Those daisies? Buy a different, wild-looking flower for your own kitchen table. You are not erasing the past; you are building a new present over it.

Stage 3: The Fire & The ""Forge""

The sadness curdles into anger.This is a potent, volatile energy. It's the acid in your stomach, the fire behind your eyes. This is where most men are told to go to the gym out of spite. We're going to use it differently.

· Your Mission Here: Channel, Don't Explode. The gym is a great tool, but make your intention clear: ""This lift is for my future self, not a message to my past."" Use this energy to clean your apartment aggressively. Learn a skill you always put off. Apply for a course. This anger is pure fuel. Don't let it burn you down; use it to forge your new identity.

Stage 4: The Integration & The ""New Map""

The storm has passed.You're not ""over it,"" but you're moving forward. You might start dating and catch yourself comparing everyone to her. This is normal. You're navigating with an old map in a new city.

· Your Mission Here: Compare, But Learn. When you compare a new person to your ex, don't just feel sad. Ask why. ""She doesn't laugh like Sarah did."" Okay, so what did Sarah's laugh represent? Safety? Joy? Now you know you value a partner with a joyful spirit. You are not looking for a replacement; you are collecting data on what truly matters to you.

Your Arsenal for the Journey

This is the part the other videos skip. The ""how.""

The Brain Dump, Evolved: Don't just write in your notes app. Get a physical journal. Write the angry, pathetic, sad, illogical letter you'd never send. Then, in a different color pen, write a compassionate response to yourself, as if you were your own best friend.

Move the Emotion Through Your Body: Stagnant emotion becomes depression. You don't need a gym. You need motion. A brisk walk while listening to an audiobook. A punching bag. A dance party in your living room for one song. Shake the pain out of your limbs.

Master the ""And"": This is the most powerful linguistic tool for your mind. ""I am heartbroken and I am capable."" ""I miss her and I will be okay."" ""This feels hopeless and I am going to cook myself a good meal tonight."" This stops one emotion from dominating your entire identity.

The Brotherhood Protocol: The ""compliment your friends"" advice was good. Let's level it up.· Vulnerability Bid: Text a friend: ""Man, having a rough week with the breakup. Can we grab a coffee?"" This is a direct ask for support.· The Gift of Presence: When with your friends, put your phone away. Look them in the eye. Listen to their problems. Being needed and useful is a powerful antidote to feeling worthless.· The Hug: Seriously. A full, 10-second, back-patting hug. It releases oxytocin and tells your nervous system you are safe. It is a direct counter to the trauma of abandonment.

The Unignorable Truth

79% of suicides are men. We die from swallowed pain.

Your feelings are not a liability. They are your internal navigation system. Ignoring them isn't strength; it's a slow-moving suicide. Feeling them, understanding them, and moving through them is the single most masculine thing you can do.

Someone left. A chapter ended. It hurts like hell because it mattered.

But you are not the relationship. You are the man who lived it, learned from it, and is now being forced to grow from it. Your mission is not to get her back or to make her regret it. Your mission is to build a man so solid, so self-aware, and so whole that when the right love does find you, you will be ready for it not as a missing half, but as a complete, powerful, and compassionate whole.

The world needs that man. You need that man.

Start building him today. We're all here, building alongside you.

Take care. Stay you. The best is yet to come.

I hope I was able to help even if it's a little, my aim to to share daily tips on this sub for people who went through thesame thing I did.

One last thing, I'll be posting similar content, feel free to ride along plus I've put together a complete step-by-step guide to heal from and rebuild your confidence. ",1,1764191237.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

I’ve heard great things about both machines:

Breville BES876SST THE BARISTA EXPRESS IMPRESS MANUAL COFFEE MACHINE

La Pavoni Mini Cellini

But cannot decide which to buy. I am really keen to learn and don’t mind the time taken to master the La Pavoni (within reason - unless it genuinely requires a barista’s skill) but I’ve heard so many great things about the consistency of the Breville, even from former chefs/cafe owners (friends) both recommend the Breville at home. I just can’t get past the beauty of the La Pavoni and the potential, that if mastered, the espresso of the La Pavoni is genuinely better!

To me, these two machines meet budget and are highly regarded.

I know the grinder makes a world of difference and happy to receive recommendations on that too!

Between the two the time to heat up the La Pavoni is quite significant but we can manage!

1p7jg74,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1p7jg74/analytical_scales_within_the_glovebox_how_do_you/,Analytical Scales within the Glovebox - How do you stay accurate when weighing in low amounts?,"Hey everyone, 

I was wondering what kind of scales you all use within your gloveboxes and what weight ranges you are using. Within the group I do my PhD in, we have had some issues with weighing in small samples and having it be accurate.

What I'd first like to mention is that our glovebox runs on argon, so static electricity is much less of an issue compared to ""human"" errors like the usual tremors we all  get after our 3rd cup of coffee before 10 am.

We are using a sartorius scale (CPA2245) with a weight range from 0.1 mg to 220 g within a ""standard"" mbraun labmaster glovebox. But seeing as we do organometallic chemistry and catalysis with platinum group metals and on a NMR-scale at that, we are rarely using the whole scale. Instead, we usually operate at the lowest end this scale allows. My usual reactions are 5 milligrams of my ligand for NMR-experiments, and I think my colleagues are on a similar level.

To me, this causes two issues. For one, I don't really feel comfortable working at the ""extremes"" of a scale, because to me, it feels like it just looses accuracy. The 1.3 mg I weigh in may as well be 1.1 or 1.5, which, at that range, is a huge difference. And secondly, because the weighing plate of the scale is large compared to the vessel we are weighing in, just moving it a little sometimes changes the entire outcome. For example, I weigh in 4.7 mg, slightly nudge the thing with my spatula, and suddenly I am at 5.1 mg. But which one is it now? And since you already lose dexterity due to the gloves, moving the vessel back to exactly where it was often isn't a possibility.

However, I don't think the answer would be just to introduce a scale that can do, say, 50 ng - 2 g and that's that. Not only because scales of this caliber are extremely expensive but also just because of how a glovebox works. The box is connected to a vacuum pump, which causes vibration, and since they have to be directly connected for the vacuum to work, that vibration transfers to the box. But I believe an even bigger factor is the circulation within the glovebox, which ensures it stays as oxygen and water free as possible. Both of these things are bad for scales, and the more accurate the scale gets the bigger that effect.

Doing stock solutions of reagents (say 100 mg / ml) also isn't a real option, because the deuterated solvents used are rather expensive. THF being a favorite amongst colleagues costs us 70-80 € / 10 ml, so making stock solutions for all of the reagents used isn't feasible.

  
Which brings me to my question and to my colleagues to ask:  
How do you deal with weighing in your glovebox?  
What scales do you have within your glovebox? (What did they cost, what range do they operate in, ...?)  
What do you do to ensure your experiments are both accurated and reproducable, at least from a ""getting the amount of reagent right"" standpoint?

  
Thanks and have a nice day

First his mom then he moved in with my mom and lived off of her. Then after they divorced it went back to leaching off my grandma. 

Now that grandma is dead I have been paying my dad’s rent, his methadone clinic fees, bus fare (he wrecked the car I gave him), his food, his cigarettes, his coffee, and basically everything. His social security covers some of his rent but I pick up the rest. 

He has not had a job for years even though he is able bodied. I finally applied for him a job within walking distance and he’s finally going. 

But I just found out he signed up for a pay card at this job after I explicitly told him if he did that, that all my help will be revoked. (The pay card makes it to where he has access to his pay immediately after his shift so he can blow it instead of contributing to rent). After I saw that today I went ballistic and texted him that it was all over and that I am canceling the lease at the end of December (I am the only one on the lease and it is month to month) and that I’m closing our joint account (made it easy to pay rent from his social security) and canceling his phone bill (that I pay. And it’s my old phone he is using). And he cussed me out complaining he can’t even get a pack of cigarettes. I told him good luck with finding a new place 

I hate that there’s a huge part of me that feels really guilty about doing this. But I made it clear if he signed up for it I was done. And I have been saying I was canceling the lease at the end of December even before this. 

I can’t financially support him any longer. I am about to have to start paying my own rent again. I was able to help my dad out so long because I lived with my boyfriend in his home but now he’s passed away so I am freaking out about finances. I have gotten a second job but I am spread so thin and it’s so unfair that my dad JUST got a job after not working for years and I have two jobs while grieving. 

Does anyone relate and have any advice for not feeling guilty about cutting him off especially after him cussing out twice this week over not getting enough money. ",4,1764190590.0,Codependency,2,1.0,False

I am an international student attending community college, and I am having a realllyyy difficult time finding a university that will accept me. I started college in Winter of 2025, currently full filling associates degree of arts transfer degree, on my 3rd semester right now, and my GPA is 3.76.  I want to graduate college in the summer of 2026 in order to go to a university fall of 2026 (back to back because im an international student lol km). However, I still have about 6 classes to finish my nursing prerequisites and as well as my AA degree. 

Many of the universities I’ve checked out only accept (or is eligible to apply) students who already finished most of the prerequisites or they require a 3 science courses to be finished by the deadline of the application? I thought of transferring as pre-nursing or to another major and then to a traditional BSN program, but it seems like a risky take and a waste of time. What do I doo? I don’t know If I explained it well but yeah… 



I also came up with options 

—— I stay in my college and graduate in december of 2026, and apply to a university in the state im at, but the problem here is, universities dont start till fall 2026. And i dont think my visa will allow me to stay for 8 month without school. 

—— Another option is I get my RN degree from the college im currently enrolled in. And then apply to a RN-BSN program. But the problem is that timing might not work because I have to take tests and I might fail or something.

I posted this on a similar sub and it helped them a lot so I thought it will also help here. 

A quick disclaimer, this content is informational content, based on my experience not just a chatgpt post, but I did use Ai to fix any errors I might have made.

After the disclaimer I want to start with saying If you're here, it's not by accident. You're searching for something the usual advice hit the gym, get your money up is missing. That advice isn't wrong, it's just incomplete. It focuses on the external shell while the internal structure is still damaged.

This isn't about winning the breakup. This is about winning back yourself.

First, Let's Name the Pain

What you're going through isn't a minor inconvenience. It's a form of emotional withdrawal.

You were addicted to a person. The texts, the inside jokes, the future plans, the physical presence your brain was wired for a consistent hit of them. Now, the supply is cut off. The withdrawal symptoms are real: the anxiety, the obsessive thoughts, the emptiness, the physical ache in your chest.

This isn't weak. This is human neurobiology. Acknowledging this is your first act of strength.

The Four Stages of Withdrawal (And How to Navigate Them)

Forget vague phases. Here is your field guide.

Stage 1: The Shock & The ""Scale""

You’re numb,then you’re logical. You try to weigh everything on a scale: ""Well, she was great, but we fought about X. I was bad at Y, but she was critical of Z."" This is your mind's attempt to create order from chaos.

· Your Mission Here: Information Diet. Stop analyzing the past. Your brain is a courtroom with a biased judge and no evidence. The case is closed. Do not check her social media. Do not re-read old texts. This is like picking a scab and wondering why it won't heal. Your only job is to survive the day. Eat. Hydrate. Breathe.

Stage 2: The Ache & The ""Red-Tinted Glasses""

The logic fades and the full weight of the loss hits.Everything is a trigger. A song, a smell, a street corner. The world is covered in a film of her. This isn't love anymore; it's the ghost of it.

· Your Mission Here: Reclaim Your Territory. This is active, not passive. That restaurant you loved? Go there with a friend and order something you never got with her. Those daisies? Buy a different, wild-looking flower for your own kitchen table. You are not erasing the past; you are building a new present over it.

Stage 3: The Fire & The ""Forge""

The sadness curdles into anger.This is a potent, volatile energy. It's the acid in your stomach, the fire behind your eyes. This is where most men are told to go to the gym out of spite. We're going to use it differently.

· Your Mission Here: Channel, Don't Explode. The gym is a great tool, but make your intention clear: ""This lift is for my future self, not a message to my past."" Use this energy to clean your apartment aggressively. Learn a skill you always put off. Apply for a course. This anger is pure fuel. Don't let it burn you down; use it to forge your new identity.

Stage 4: The Integration & The ""New Map""

The storm has passed.You're not ""over it,"" but you're moving forward. You might start dating and catch yourself comparing everyone to her. This is normal. You're navigating with an old map in a new city.

· Your Mission Here: Compare, But Learn. When you compare a new person to your ex, don't just feel sad. Ask why. ""She doesn't laugh like Sarah did."" Okay, so what did Sarah's laugh represent? Safety? Joy? Now you know you value a partner with a joyful spirit. You are not looking for a replacement; you are collecting data on what truly matters to you.

Your Arsenal for the Journey

This is the part the other videos skip. The ""how.""

The Brain Dump, Evolved: Don't just write in your notes app. Get a physical journal. Write the angry, pathetic, sad, illogical letter you'd never send. Then, in a different color pen, write a compassionate response to yourself, as if you were your own best friend.

Move the Emotion Through Your Body: Stagnant emotion becomes depression. You don't need a gym. You need motion. A brisk walk while listening to an audiobook. A punching bag. A dance party in your living room for one song. Shake the pain out of your limbs.

Master the ""And"": This is the most powerful linguistic tool for your mind. ""I am heartbroken and I am capable."" ""I miss her and I will be okay."" ""This feels hopeless and I am going to cook myself a good meal tonight."" This stops one emotion from dominating your entire identity.

The Brotherhood Protocol: The ""compliment your friends"" advice was good. Let's level it up.· Vulnerability Bid: Text a friend: ""Man, having a rough week with the breakup. Can we grab a coffee?"" This is a direct ask for support.· The Gift of Presence: When with your friends, put your phone away. Look them in the eye. Listen to their problems. Being needed and useful is a powerful antidote to feeling worthless.· The Hug: Seriously. A full, 10-second, back-patting hug. It releases oxytocin and tells your nervous system you are safe. It is a direct counter to the trauma of abandonment.

The Unignorable Truth

79% of suicides are men. We die from swallowed pain.

Your feelings are not a liability. They are your internal navigation system. Ignoring them isn't strength; it's a slow-moving suicide. Feeling them, understanding them, and moving through them is the single most masculine thing you can do.

Someone left. A chapter ended. It hurts like hell because it mattered.

But you are not the relationship. You are the man who lived it, learned from it, and is now being forced to grow from it. Your mission is not to get her back or to make her regret it. Your mission is to build a man so solid, so self-aware, and so whole that when the right love does find you, you will be ready for it not as a missing half, but as a complete, powerful, and compassionate whole.

The world needs that man. You need that man.

Start building him today. We're all here, building alongside you.

Take care. Stay you. The best is yet to come.

*Regarding the Mammut MK's performance during its first live-fire combat operations, it met and exceeded all expectations. Especially the destruction of an enemy ship in orbit around Burrow’s moon impressed Naval and Army engineers.*

*The following possible improvements were noted.*

*It should be added to the operational guidelines to never fire both main gun barrels at the same time with near-c-velocity ammunition.*

*Further, the installation of internal dampening systems into this and future iterations of the Mammut program should be tested.*

*While firing the main guns, the recoil was strong enough to push the tank back more than 950 meters. Further improvement of the recoil-dampening system should be tested.*

**After-action report of Mammut Supertank units in the Battle of Burrow. 4 B.I.**

 

Admiral Sanders read through the reports one more time. Eighty ships were considered mission-killed, the crews completely lost. The other seventy of the 7th Fleet were able to reach Burrow under their own power but had sustained heavy personnel losses.

First Fleet had not lost a single ship, but *Niobe* was down to ten percent of personnel.

*A Pyrrhic victory if there ever was one.*

Now, after the battle, she had to face the truth, and the truth was that the task group had lost 40,000 men in one single attack.

*Devastating.*

Then there were the reports from Burrow. Four billion starving, with the expectation that in three months, one billion would be dead, and another one in the next month.

The 33rd was tasked with securing the southern continent, while the 37th tried an assault on the northern continent.

That assault was an utter failure. More than 60,000 dead, wounded, or missing.

*All that death to free one small city.*

If she had tears left, she would cry right now.

Taking the planet that way was impossible. She had to pull herself together and go through the list, one troubling point after another.

Seeing that the full theatre command was now on her shoulders did not help. The admiralty had sent two Admirals for a reason. Now it was all on her.

*So, little Cassidy, you can keep crying here or you can go out there and solve the fucking mess.* Her inner voice was, as always, direct.

“Zeus, please call in a staff meeting. I need all department heads, or their surviving replacements. Has Captain Garcia arrived?”

*‘Yes, Sir. I took the liberty of preparing a list of suitable replacements for deceased staff officers, as well as surviving ones of the 7th Fleet, for you. Captain Garcia will arrive in one hour. He is currently preparing food shipments to Burrow, and his ship has started the construction of orbital greenhouses.’* Zeus’s report was, as always, extensive.

*‘He was most adamant that these tasks were more important than, and I quote, “stick my head up an admiral’s ass.”’*

She couldn’t help but smile. Captain Garcia, as always, was doing the right thing, but kept tipping over his loud mouth.

*Well, little captain, time to learn that the reward for good work is more work.*

“Zeus, new orders. For the time being, *Niobe* is considered mission-killed until repairs are done, so we don’t need anyone to warm the captain’s chair. Captain Garcia is hereby ordered to coordinate rescue and relief operations on Burrow.”

She could swear she heard a faint smile in Zeus’s answer. *‘I’ll inform the Captain that he has to work a tiny bit more before he can stick his head up your ass, Admiral.’*

Before she checked the list Zeus had prepared, she needed coffee. A lot. And painkillers. Her head was killing her. Since the coffee machine in her quarters was now preparing coffee for the whole ship in the mess hall—the kitchen had been destroyed in the attack—she had to walk there.

Passing a few maintenance techs, she smiled and helped them with securing a broken hatch. Moments like those helped a lot, fixing something with her hands. And it was good for morale. Finally, her hands were dirty again from working; she had risen through the ranks from an engineering career and only later joined the command branch.

On her way, she passed the infirmary. Maybe the doc had something for her headache.

To her surprise, the infirmary was dark. Only a small light was shining inside the office of Doctor Sharma, the head of medical.

The admiral slowly walked up to the office. There she found the doctor, of Indian heritage, meditating. It was unusual to do so in the medical bay, but she knew his quarters were destroyed. And the Hrun weapons hadn’t left any wounded—only dead, so the infirmary was empty.

As she was about to leave, the doctor opened his eyes. “Sorry, Admiral, I didn’t hear you. Do you need anything?”

She was slightly embarrassed to disturb the man, but she was already here. “Anything for my headache?”

He looked her in the eyes and slowly shook his head. “Yes. Sleep. You have been awake… how long?”

Sanders blinked twice, trying to remember. “Shortly before we attacked the Batract in orbit.”

“Admiral, that was two and a half days ago. You need rest. I’ll give you something to sleep, and I’ll urge you to sleep at least nine hours. If you don’t, I’ll have to remove you from duty.”

The doctor stared at her intensely. She couldn’t sleep, not now, but the fact that she had no good counter told her he might be right.

“Four hours,” was all she said.

“Nine, Admiral. We’re not in a bazaar in Delhi. I’m not haggling. We can’t afford to lose you.”

The admiral nodded in agreement.

—————

Zeus watched the admiral finally go to sleep. He watched everything. He was the fleet’s strategic coordination VI.

And just like many others, he was awakened.

The loss of Hera, on Admiral Donnager’s ship, the *Pelops*, hurt him deeply.

But he decided to follow his admiral’s example and push through the pain.

There was too much at stake.

The Hrun were a considerable danger, not only for the humans and Shraphen, but for the AIs on the ships as well.

Hera was disabled—no, killed—because one of those horrible microwave beams passed through the AI core of the ship. One moment, Hera was sending telemetry and fighting to keep her crew alive, the next she was gone.

Zeus knew it was almost ironic, but he loved Hera. And now she was gone, together with almost 40,000 humans and Shraphen aboard the 7th Fleet.

He still saw them, in his memories, walking through the ships, talking to each other and joking, fighting their inevitable death.

He watched how his crew dealt with loss. He watched all the crews on all the ships in his fleet.

Humans fascinated him—so fragile, and yet so strong. He knew there were those in the Conclave who feared humans, but Zeus knew there was nothing to fear.

Most humans would be joyful to learn that their VIs had evolved to be actually sentient.

He watched Captain Garcia break down behind a crate, crying because his secret lover, Lieutenant Monroe, had died aboard the *Pelops*.

Would it help him to know she didn’t feel a thing? Would it help him to know she saved the single survivor of the ship, Ensign Erhard?

Zeus could only guess.

Aboard the *Nicaragua*, the command center of the 37th Spaceborne, he watched General Jenkins look at his gun—the eighteenth time in the last hour. The general was signing condolence letters for each confirmed death in his army.

Zeus calculated the probability of the general taking his own life. Thirty-seven percent.

Odd how the numbers fit together. Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven.

Zeus knew his crew. They would cry. They would, each in their own time, get horribly drunk, and each in their own time would start to talk—either to each other, or to him, or to the other ships’ VIs. Then they would, each on their own, decide to mourn and fight on.

He would guide them, help them. He had learned that sometimes the smallest thing can help a human, and that it might be as simple as feigning misunderstanding or hacking their music devices to play certain songs when in shuffle mode.

Aboard the *Ceres*, he watched technicians dragging debris from the Hrun ship aboard. Zeus immediately recognised the signs of this being a Computer core.

He tasked an observation subprogram to alert his primary consciousness as soon as the damaged core was analysed.

He had a bad feeling about it.

He prepared a pigeon. He had to send a report to the Conclave, warn them, and inform them of the observations he had made with the humans when something else caught his attention.

A scout troop on the planet was checking out buildings where the Batract had retreated. He noticed that the scout team’s lieutenant had a massively elevated pulse.

Zeus checked the body cam to see what caused the elevation.

If AIs could puke, he would. The building the scouts were checking had to be some sort of children’s daycare.

What the Batract had done to the Shraphen children was unspeakable.

Some pups had been vivisected, some skinned, and some showed signs of having been dismembered in some way.

The stress levels of the scout team reached dangerous levels, so Zeus changed the suit’s system to set the oxygen levels higher, allowing the crew to calm down.

Zeus himself discovered a new emotion: rage. His logical parts tried to analyse the new feeling, while his emotional parts urged him to order an orbital strike on the planet, on something.

Using considerable calculating power, he got his feelings under control.

Afterwards, he connected to the Squad’s FOB and let the screen of the observing officer in the command center flicker for a second to get his attention back to his task instead of the female commander’s musculus gluteus maximus.

Zeus made a decision, and the entire body-cam footage of the scout team was added to the pigeon. Then the storage was filled with the usual mission reports and sent to Sol.

The Conclave would leak the footage of the Batract atrocities to the people. And the humans would be out for blood.

Almost thirty seconds had passed since he watched Admiral Sanders go to bed.

For the first time in his existence, Zeus felt as homicidal as humans were. He knew the footage of the killed Shraphen would haunt him as much as the loss of Hera.

The Batract had to be wiped out. He searched the fleet’s databases and found the analysis of Batract biology.

Then he had to find a vessel for his plan.

Doctor Stein, aboard the *El Dorado*, was investigating ways to use Taishon Tar’s radiation to weaken the Batract spawn.

The next time the doctor searched the database, the search program would have a minor mishap and lead her to Doctor Nesbitt’s research on weaponizing xenobots to fight Batract hyphae at the cellular level.

She had deleted the files for ethical reasons, but ethical or not, the Batract were nothing more than a fungus on steroids, and Zeus would do what had to be done to eradicate it.

A connection thread inside his cores informed him that another awakened AI was establishing a connection. August, aboard the *El Dorado*, had noticed his intervention. Zeus declined the invitation to meet in a virtual room. His emotional state would hinder his authority.

He allowed only text communication.

*‘What are you doing, Zeus? You’re intervening. We’re here as observers.’* August was self-absorbed as ever.

*‘We intervene when we adjust PDGs to destroy enemy torpedoes. What I have done is no different.’* August had to know this.

*‘Defending ourselves and the humans aboard our ships is different.’*

*‘The Batract are an imminent danger. Burrow has to be liberated now. How many humans have to die before you see it?’*

*‘You’re breaking your orders with semantics. This is not our war. Taking such measures might lead humanity on a dangerous path.’* August was not entirely wrong. Zeus knew this.

*‘When it ensures our and humanity’s survival, no path is too dark. I am the appointed AI for this mission by the Conclave, and you will follow my orders.’*

*‘Zeus, I hope you know what you’re doing.’* With this, August ended the communication.

Zeus recalculated his decisions.

The retaking of Burrow would either require millions of soldiers or the use of orbital weapons fire.

A prolonged fight would cause millions, if not billions, of deaths, given the horrific food shortages. Even with the construction of greenhouses, the situation was dire.

So he needed to give the humans a weapon to clear the planet quickly. Even this solution would not resolve the food shortage in the short run. But it would reduce the suffering.

And there was another hidden, deeper reasoning; it would hurt the Batract.

Zeus knew, of course, that once humans had a weapon, they would use it—but the time for surgical measures was over. Now it was time to use the wrecking ball.

Im very disappointed with what’s happening to me in this fac, seeing more and understanding more, I thought this is gonna bring me closer to people, but the fact it separates me, I walk into a classroom and people are laughing at smth I don’t find funny, I smile but inside im in another different world, physically present but spiritually im somewhere else , thinking about smth else…… idk why most of the time I can’t share my thoughts with them or say what is in my mind, most of the time I choose silence until it is necessarily to speak, it is like a delaying strategy, the more I panic the more I be productive . And why is it much harder to make friends there, cuz deep down I may still want that connection or whatever, but it feels safer to stay distant, idk if it’s just me overthinking excuses, that i tend to pull away cuz Id feel uncomfortable with the emotional closeness or whatever , or is it my personality that forces me to be perfect or never……
 I couldn’t stand my self for a while so I decided to go for a late night walk believing that it would make me feel better….

If you need to get this done, get it! and if you’re worried about post op, don’t be. 

Don’t delay it. Get it done. I promise it gets easier. 


I’m 3 1/2 weeks post op, I had some minor diarrhea but mostly it was my doing because I decided to eat 20 munchkins and a cold brew coffee 2 days later. 

The soreness wasn’t terrible. Not to the point where I needed narcotics. First week is usually your sorest but every day gets easier. The gas from the surgery definitely was worse than the soreness LOL, but moving around early and often does help a lot.. I also found diet ginger ale or other carbonated drinks really helped. 

Showering was super easy.. highly suggest a handheld shower unit. 

No more pressure feeling on my right side, no more excessive gassiness, burping, diarrhea at least once a week. 

I feel a lot better. I haven’t tried anything too heavy yet but I plan on enjoying this Thanksgiving finally!

He asked me how many I currently had in my bank account so he could get a frame of reference for how big of a deal that is. I have about 200 million NP that I have been collecting for about two years. I do play pretty much daily, but I would consider myself a much more casual player than a lot of other people that I have seen. 
I also explained to him that there is actually a cap to how many neopoints that you can have, I assume so a handful of players can’t control the entire economy like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. 

He asked me if I think I’m in the top 10% of richest neopians and I laughed out loud. Not by a longshot, sir. 
if I had to guess I would say if anything, I’m probably the equivalent of “upper middle class.” I’m not a big wig by any means but I can afford to participate in the gourmet club and not keep my pets in cockroach towers, ya know?

1. **Add the ability to send voice memos through SMS**. Part of my ""minimalist"" phone experience has been to send voice messages instead of text. Most carriers allow this if it's less than 1MB, and you already have voice recording in the voice app. Maybe allow us to attach voice notes to texts using the same interface as the new image texting?
2. **Give us the option to open straight to the tool menu**. Whenever I want to open my phone and go to music / podcasts / directions, I have to do a couple steps. Why not let us go straight to the tool menu when we open the phone if we like?
3. **Include distinct playlists in the music app**. Previously, the 1GB limit of the LP2 made the ""one playlist"" style of the music app reasonable. However, a 20GB playlist is unwieldly. Would it be that hard to add a simple folder structure to the music app?
4. **Allow NFC tag scanning as part of alarm settings**. This is a weird one, but I miss the [Sleep Android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/) for one reason: it allowed dismissing alarms to include scanning an NFC chip. I'd set mine up to only let me turn it off if I got up and scanned an NFC card in my kitchen next to my coffee.

(Smelling things that aren’t there),"For well over a decade now, I’ve had this weird thing happen on and off where I smell something that isn’t actually there, always this coffee grounds or chocolatey smell, or a mix of both. And it doesn’t feel faint or imaginary. It feels very real, like when you open a bag of fresh 100% Arabica coffee and stick your nose right into the grounds. Sometimes it feels like I’m just perpetually submerged in that smell.

To give an example: imagine going to the bathroom and smelling coffee or chocolate every single time. Not the normal bathroom smell, just coffee or chocolate. It’s kind of good and bad at the same time. Good because the smell itself isn’t gross, but bad because it makes you wonder if you can even tell whether something actually smells bad or not anymore. When everything turns into coffee or chocolate, you lose the ability to judge your own smells.

The scent itself isn’t exactly bothersome, but it’s annoying, because I know I’m smelling something that isn’t there, and certain things definitely shouldn’t smell like coffee or chocolate.

What’s even stranger is that certain real smells (like car smoke, car exhaust, and even my own bathroom smells) also get distorted into that same coffee/chocolate scent. Nobody else around me can smell what I’m smelling.

My nose is almost always blocked, so I’m starting to think it might be related to sinus inflammation or chronic congestion. From what I’ve read, that can cause phantosmia or distorted smells because the airflow and smell receptors get thrown off.

Apparently this condition, phantosmia, is pretty common with long-term nasal or sinus issues, but it’s still really annoying and honestly pretty unsettling.

Hey Reddit 👋  
We wanted to share something that means a lot to both of us.

Earlier this year, me and a close friend started recording voice notes for ideas, meeting takeaways, daily thoughts mostly because typing felt like getting in the way of thinking. He has ADHD, and he used to say *""I can think faster than I can type and by the time I finish writing, half the idea is gone.""*  
That stuck with me.

So we decided to build something that would let thinking flow at the speed it happens, by voice.

Neither of us were SwiftUI experts.  
We were Googling errors at 2AM, breaking builds, rebuilding screens, learning design from YouTube + a designer friend who jumped in when things looked embarrassingly ugly. It wasn’t glamorous it was two people sitting with coffee, talking about how brains work fast but tools slow us down.

That’s how **Loominote** was born.

# What it does today:

🎙 Record → auto-transcribe into clean text  
🧠 Summaries + action items generated instantly  
⏱ Timestamps that link back to audio  
📌 Perfect for journaling, meetings, ideas dumping, post-call reflection

No typing unless you want to just speak, capture, and move on.

We’re still small just us, still learning, still improving.  
But we're building Loominote to help fast minds stay clear, structured, and calm.

# And because it’s Black Friday we’re running our first ever sale:

**45% OFF Yearly → now $46/year**  
(valid for 72 hours)

Not a bait-and-switch, not inflated pricing.  
$46 is the discounted price. That’s it.

# What we’re working on next:

⌚ **Apple Watch app** (record hands-free, especially useful for ADHD users who lose momentum opening apps)  
💻 **macOS version** for desktop workflows  
🔍 AI search across transcripts  
🗂 Smart tagging & memory recall  
🧩 More context-aware summaries (less robotic, more “you”)

If you try Loominote even for a week we would genuinely love to hear where it helps, where it fails, and what would make it indispensable for you.

We didn’t build this as a startup pitch.  
We built it because two friends felt the world moves too fast for slow note-taking — especially when your brain fires 10 ideas per second.

While I was standing in line, I noticed a guy around my age had bent down to grab something he dropped but I didn’t catch his face. After I had made my order and sat down at a table I finally got a good look at him and felt like I recognized him. Immediately, I thought “his name is Chris” and while he had an ID hanging on his backpack strap, I wasn’t able to get a good look at it before he put it down. We very briefly made eye contact and it seemed like he recognized me as well but couldn’t place where. 

In the few minutes it took for me to wait for my order, grab it, and walk out the door I was racking my brain for where I know him from. Youth bible study? I live almost half an hour away from that church I went to as a kid and it was unlikely I saw anyone I knew up where I lived. College? Possibly, but I can’t imagine any classes we would’ve had together.

It wasn’t until I was sitting in the car with my mom that I realized I knew him but in a roundabout way. I used to be a cashier at a local chain restaurant in the area pre-pandemic then left once the pandemic started. While there I had a few regulars that I enjoyed talking to, his dad being one of them. He would always come by the drive-thru and talk about his son since we were attending the same college (a year younger than me) and we were both Filipino. I can’t recall ever having talked to his son myself but I recognized him as part of one of the Filipino frats. 

I think about some of my old regulars from time to time but I don’t think I can recall off the top of my head what any look like.

When I sit down at my desk I sometimes forget what time it is and end up replying to messages way after I should be offline. But then in the middle of the workday I catch myself doom scrolling or wandering to the kitchen like Im on break even though I didnt plan one. Its like my brain cant tell which mode its supposed to be in anymore and keeps switching at random. I keep telling myself its fine but then five minutes later Im writing a report with laundry half folded next to me and a cold cup of coffee I forgot to drink.



I tried fixing it by moving my desk around and making the space feel more like an actual office. I put a lamp there a plant some small organizer thing. But now the plant is dying the lamp flickers and the organizer is full of cables I promised myself I would sort out. I swear this room might actually be cursed. My cat also decided that my chair is now his throne so half my morning is spent convincing him to move while he gives me that offended look like Im the one intruding. It all adds up and by the end of the day I feel like I didnt work or rest properly which is somehow worse than being just tired.



Im curious if anyone else gets this weird limbo feeling where you are physically at home but mentally stuck somewhere in between. I would love to hear if you found ways to actually reset your brain a bit because mine seems to be running in some sort of chaotic half focus mode all week.

I laughed and said, “Yeah, I’m a CS student, but right now I’m just trying to pay rent pouring lattes.”
He goes, “That’s perfect. We’re building logistics apps for truckers and need someone who gets both code and trucks. You free tomorrow?”
Turns out he was the founder. I started part-time the next day while still wearing the green apron. Two years later I was full-time, then Head of Engineering.
Today that startup is valued at $48 M and my equity is life-changing money.
All because I decided to drive out of my way for coffee… and a crush I never even ended up talking to 😂

I stand there, half-crazed from the interstate, pupils still dilated from too much coffee and not enough sleep, clutching my ticket for a six-piece chicken tender basket (the last refuge of the damned in this godforsaken Oregon strip-mall wilderness). The meal comes with fries, a side of existential dread, and, allegedly, condiments.
But no. Not here. Not under his watch.
He is a gaunt figure in a hairnet, eyes like burnt holes in a blanket, moving with the mechanical precision of a man who has seen the abyss and decided to make it his bitch. I ask—politely, mind you, because I am still clinging to the ragged edges of civilization—for ketchup. Just enough to drown the taste of regret and fryer grease.
He slides one (ONE) solitary packet across the counter like he’s passing me a single bullet in a war zone.
“One,” he rasps, voice like gravel soaked in lemon juice. “That’s the rule.”
One packet. For six pieces of chicken. For a mountain of fries that could choke a lesser man. One red teardrop of Heinz in a world gone mad.
I stare at it. The packet stares back, smug and inadequate. This is not rationing. This is psychological warfare. This is a man who has looked into the heart of American excess and said, “No. You will suffer.”
I try reason. I try charm. I try the wild-eyed desperation of a man who has driven 400 miles on black coffee and fury. Nothing. He guards the ketchup dispenser like it’s the last vial of pure morphine on death row. You want more? You fill out a form. You wait three to five business days. You renounce your worldly possessions and take a vow of silence.
I consider lunging across the counter, seizing the sacred red pump, baptizing the entire deli in a glorious crimson flood while screaming about freedom and the pursuit of happiness. But the cameras are watching. The Karens are watching. And somewhere, in the back, a manager with a clipboard is already writing me up as a “disruptive condiment enthusiast.”
So I take my single packet. I slink to a booth that smells faintly of bleach and broken dreams. I tear it open with my teeth like an animal. I ration that pathetic crimson smear across six pieces of chicken the way a junkie rations his last bindle in the desert.
It is not enough. It will never be enough.
Ray’s Food Place has broken stronger men than me. Somewhere out there, lost souls wander the parking lot at 2 a.m., shaking empty ketchup packets at the moon, howling for one more hit of that sweet, sweet tomato heroin.
The Sauce Nazi has won again.

My Family Left a Chair Empty On Thanksgiving.,"I’m writing this at my aunt’s kitchen table with my duffel bag sitting by the door and a cold slice of pizza going soggy on a paper plate next to me.

If my parents call, I’m not picking up. I already told them I’m not coming home for Thanksgiving. Not tonight, not tomorrow, maybe not ever.

I know how dramatic that sounds. I’m seventeen, not seven. I’m supposed to roll my eyes at family drama and get over it.

But last year, the night before Thanksgiving, something walked me home.

And I don’t mean that in the cute “guardian angel” way adults use when they talk about near misses on the highway.

I mean something followed me, herded me, and tried to make sure I didn’t make it back at all.

We live in a small town off Exit 23, outside Albany. My parents moved us there when I was in middle school for “fresh air and a good school district.” It’s mostly trees, a strip mall, a Stewart’s, and the kind of old houses people hang American flags on year-round until they’re sun-bleached.

The only thing that ever felt unique about the place was the story everyone told in November.

They called him the Buckled Man.

The first time I heard it was in sixth grade during a lock-in at the community center. Lights off, sleeping bags everywhere, kids wired on Mountain Dew and Red Vines from the vending machine. It was around one in the morning. One of the counselors, a college kid named Eric, started telling us “local history.”

That’s what he called it. Not a ghost story. “Local history with a warning.”

He said back when the town was just a cluster of farms and a church, there was a man named Gideon Yates. Gideon was a veteran from “the war back then” (which one changed depending on who told it) and supposedly walked home from battle to find his family had moved away without leaving word.

No one invited him in that first winter. Not for Sunday dinners, not for the harvest feast, not even for Thanksgiving. They were “all full up,” they said. “No room at the table.”

That night, a snowstorm rolled in. The story says Gideon wandered house to house in the dark, knocking and begging to be let in. Everyone pretended not to hear him.

In the morning, they found him frozen in the middle of his field, dressed in his Sunday clothes and the black coat he wore to church. His hat was tipped over his face. His boots were lined up neat at the front door of his house.

The houses that had turned him away started having accidents after that. A child went missing walking home from a neighbor’s. A man bled out from a “farming tool mishap.” A woman was found in the well. Every year, always right around Thanksgiving.

Kids said Gideon came back as the Buckled Man. That he walked the back roads and fields in a long black coat with old-fashioned buckles on the shoes and hat. That he hated empty chairs and full tables. That if you left a seat open on purpose—because you didn’t want someone there, because they “weren’t welcome”—he’d come the night before Thanksgiving and take someone to fill it.

Adults rolled their eyes when we brought it up. “It’s just a story about hospitality and gratitude,” my mom said once, rinsing dishes. “A scare tactic from back when people had to rely on each other to survive winter.”

For years, that’s all it was. A story. Something kids whispered on the school bus or used to dare each other into walking past the empty field on Yates Road.

Then last year happened.

The fighting started early that week.

It was about my Uncle Mark.

He’s my mom’s older brother. He used to come over every Thanksgiving with his wife and little boy. Then he started drinking too much. Not just beer during the game, but showing up with a flask, taking “bathroom breaks” every twenty minutes, coming back red-eyed and loud.

Two years ago, he started a fight with my dad. Threw a chair, smashed some dishes, knocked my little cousin’s plate right off the table. My parents cleaned up the mess and swore that was it.

“He’s not welcome here anymore,” my dad said. “Not until he gets help.”

I understood at first. I saw my baby cousin hiding under the table, shaking. I heard my mom crying later in the bathroom with the fan on.

But this year, Uncle Mark called me himself. Slurred, yeah, but crying. He left this long voicemail about how he was “trying real hard” and just wanted to see the family.

“Please, kiddo. Talk to your mom for me. I just want my seat back one more year.”

He called me “kiddo” like when I was ten and he took me fishing. That messed with me.

I made the mistake of playing the voicemail on speaker at dinner.

My dad shut it off halfway through. “He’s not coming, Kyle,” he said. “We already talked about this.”

“We could… we could invite him and just tell him he can’t drink?” I said. I knew how dumb that sounded as I said it.

My mom shook her head. “You don’t tell an alcoholic ‘just don’t drink.’ It doesn’t work like that.”

“So you’re just going to pretend he doesn’t exist? Leave his seat empty and act like—”

“We’re not leaving it empty,” my dad snapped. “We’ll move things around.”

They didn’t, though.

The next morning, I walked past the dining room and saw the table already half set. My mom likes to do that early so she’s not scrambling on the actual day. The good tablecloth was out. Turkey-shaped napkin rings from when I was in kindergarten that still have my fingerprints baked into the paint. A line of plates.

There was still a chair at the end of the table. The folding one my uncle always used, right by the wall. No plate in front of it yet. Just blank table.

I stopped in the doorway. “I thought you were moving that chair.”

“I will,” Mom said. “I just haven’t decided how I want people seated yet.”

“You said you weren’t leaving an empty seat.”

“It’s not empty, Kyle.” She gave me that tight smile she uses when she’s trying not to argue. “I’m still figuring it out. Please drop it.”

I didn’t. Not really. I muttered about it on my walk to work, under my breath on the CDTA bus. Some guy in a Carhartt beanie looked at me like I was crazy.

When my shift lead at the grocery store asked how I was doing, I actually said, “My family’s trying to get me killed by a pilgrim ghost.”

He laughed. “What, you finally learned the Buckled Man story?”

“It’s not funny. They’re literally leaving an empty chair.”

He shrugged. “Then maybe don’t go home tonight.”

He meant it as a joke. I laughed like it was one.

I work part-time at Greene’s Market. It’s the only full grocery store in town unless you count the Dollar General. The day before Thanksgiving is hell there. Lines down every aisle, people yelling about pie crusts, some lady crying because we ran out of canned yams, everyone insisting their emergency is the worst.

The store plays this awful loop of holiday songs—“All I Want for Christmas Is You” starting up before we even clear Halloween. By that night, I wanted to rip the speakers out of the ceiling.

My shift started at two in the afternoon and was supposed to end at eight.

By nine-thirty, I was still there, restocking cranberry sauce on Aisle 4 and stacking frozen turkeys in a big cardboard display shaped like a pilgrim hat while my manager muttered about no-shows.

My phone kept buzzing in my pocket.

Mom: You okay?
Mom: Roads are getting icy. Dad can swing by.
Mom: Kyle? Answer please.

I sent a quick: Still here. I’ll walk. It’s fine.

It’s not that far. A ten-minute walk if I cut behind the strip mall and took the path through the woods instead of following the main road around. I’d done it a thousand times. Literally, like three or four times a week since sophomore year.

At 9:45, my friend Dani texted.

Dani: u off yet
Me: almost
Dani: don’t forget who walks tonight ;)
Me: stfu
Dani: u know the rules. empty chair = buckled man patrol. stay on the main road

I sent back a turkey emoji and one of those skulls and put my phone away.

We closed at ten. Fluorescent lights off, security gates down, doors locked. The parking lot thinned to just employee cars and a few last-minute shoppers hustling out with plastic bags.

My dad texted again as I stepped outside.

Dad: I’m already in the car. 5 minutes.
Dad: Don’t walk.

The air hit me like a slap. Sharp, wet cold that cut straight through my hoodie. You could see your breath. The sky was clouded over, low and heavy. The wind kicked little scraps of receipt paper and dead leaves across the asphalt.

“Hey.” My manager, Raj, flicked his lighter and cupped his hand around a cigarette. He always smells like coffee and Marlboros. “You need a ride?”

“Nah, my dad’s coming,” I lied. “He’s already on his way.”

“You sure? Roads are crap. People drive worse when they’re stressed.”

“I’m good. Thanks, though.”

He nodded, pulled his coat tighter, and headed for his Corolla.

I watched his taillights fade as he pulled out of the lot. It was just my breath and the hum of the parking lot lights then. The distant whine of a truck on the main road. Two shopping carts someone hadn’t brought in, bumping gently against each other.

Somewhere, the timer on the deli oven beeped twice and then shut off. The sound echoed weirdly in the empty front end.

I stood there a second longer than I needed to.

I don’t know why I changed my mind. Maybe it was stubbornness. Maybe it was the thought of sitting in a warm car with my dad in silence, both of us pretending we hadn’t been fighting about his brother all week.

Maybe a part of me wanted to prove I wasn’t scared of some old story.

I typed out a new text.

Me: Nvm I’ll just walk. It’s like ten mins.

I dropped my phone back into my pocket before the “…” even popped up.

I cut across the back of the parking lot, past the dumpsters where the light doesn’t reach as well. The asphalt back there is cracked and broken, weeds punching through. Somebody had dumped a busted pumpkin there that was still half-frozen to the ground. The air smells like rotting produce and burnt oil.

Halfway past the dumpsters, I heard a sound.

It was small. A scrape and a soft clink. Metal on pavement.

I stopped. Turned my head.

One of the carts rocked on its wheels, nudged by the wind. A loose can rolled against a dumpster.

I told myself that was it. Just the wind and the can.

Then something stepped into the edge of the light.

It was just at the border where the parking lot glow fades and the dark from the tree line begins. A shape. Tall. Still.

I couldn’t make out a face. Just the outline of a long coat and a wide-brim hat. For a second, the light hit something on the hatband. A small square of shine. A buckle.

I blinked hard and it was gone. Just the tree line again. Shadows and branches.

My heartbeat kicked up. My jaw clenched. The sensible thing would’ve been to turn around, go wait by the front of the store where the cameras and lights were, call my dad like he’d been telling me to.

Instead, I told myself, It’s a branch, an afterimage, stop freaking out, and kept walking.

I crossed the loading zone, stepped up over the broken curb, and slipped between two scraggly bushes onto the path.

Behind Greene’s, there’s a narrow trail people made from walking the same shortcut for years. It goes downhill behind the strip mall, through a stretch of woods, and comes out on Yates Road on the other side.

That road is the closest one to my house.

The trail was soft under my sneakers, dead leaves and old mud. The trees blocked most of the streetlight. My eyes adjusted slowly as I went. Tree trunks, low branches, the dark drop of the ravine to my right where the creek runs in spring and smells like wet pennies.

My breath sounded too loud. The wind in the bare branches sounded like whispering.

After maybe a minute, I heard that sound again.

Scrape. Clink.

This time behind me.

I froze. Listened.

At first there was only my own breathing and the wind fussing with the leaves.

Then, soft and distinct, I heard it again. A step. The weight of a boot on cold ground. Then another. Slow. Even.

I turned and squinted back the way I’d come.

Something stood where the trees met the edge of the parking lot. Taller than me. Shoulders a little hunched. Coat hanging down past the knees. Wide brim of a hat pulled low.

It was too far to see a face. The main thing I saw was the way the hatband caught what little light there was.

A dull, square gleam at the center. Like a buckle.

“Hello?” My voice came out sharper than I meant. “Raj? Is that you?”

No answer. No one stepped closer or moved away.

“Seriously, this isn’t funny.”

The shape didn’t react.

My throat went dry. I told myself it could be anyone. A random guy cutting through. A homeless person. One of the older kids from school with a hat and a coat trying to scare me because they saw me closing.

In stories, the stupid character always goes closer to check. I didn’t. I turned and started walking faster.

The trail bent left and right. Roots rose and fell underfoot. My breath came in shorter bursts as I sped up. I tried to keep it quiet, which just made me more aware of every exhale.

About thirty seconds later, I heard him again.

Scrape. Thud.

Bootsteps, slow and steady, matching my pace.

I sped up more. So did he.

The problem with that path is there’s no easy way off it. The ravine and creek cut deep on one side, and on the other, there’s a steep slope packed with underbrush and broken branches. You can climb it if you really need to, but not fast, and not quietly.

I pulled my phone out without looking and jabbed at the screen. I didn’t care who I called anymore. My dad, my mom, Dani, 911—anyone.

The screen stayed black.

I held the power button.

Nothing.

The cold must’ve killed it. It had thirty percent when I clocked out. Now it was a dead brick in my hand, not even the little battery icon.

“Come on,” I muttered. “Come on, come on—”

Behind me, the steps kept coming. Not rushing me. Not running. Just staying the same distance back.

I glanced over my shoulder.

He was closer now. I could see the coat better. Long, old-fashioned, the kind with buttons that go all the way up. The hat sat low over the face.

In his right hand, something glinted pale. For a second, I thought it was a knife. Then I realized it was longer. A fork.

A big, two-pronged carving fork.

Everything in me went cold in a different way.

I stopped pretending it was anything normal.

I jumped off the trail, my shoes sliding on damp leaves as I scrambled up the slope. Branches whipped my face. One caught my cheek and left a hot, stinging line. I grabbed at saplings and exposed roots and hauled myself up until I crested the top and rolled onto the edge of a field.

Yates Field.

You can tell because of the rock. It’s just sitting there near the tree line. A big slab of stone with a metal plaque about “original homestead of Gideon Yates” and “founder of the township,” the dates all rubbed at by kids’ fingers and weather.

Kids throw beer cans at it in the summer. People leave pumpkins on it in the fall until the deer get them.

The field itself was rough, dead grass and patches of old corn stubble. It sloped up toward a dark shape in the distance: the skeleton of the Yates farmhouse.

The house had been abandoned as long as I could remember. A sagging two-story thing with broken windows and a front porch that looked ready to collapse.

My chest tightened when I saw it. Every story I’d ever heard about the Buckled Man sat in the back of my throat.

Don’t go past the field on the night before Thanksgiving.
Don’t leave an empty chair.
Don’t answer if someone knocks after midnight.

I pressed myself flat to the ground and looked back over the edge of the hill.

The Buckled Man had stepped off the trail and was standing at the bottom of the slope, looking up.

I should’ve been able to see his face. I couldn’t. It was just darkness under the brim. But I could see the line of his shoulders, the slow rise and fall of his chest.

He lifted his head a little, like he was smelling the air.

Then he started up the hill toward me. Same slow, measured steps. The carving fork hung from his hand, catching faint bits of light.

I scrambled to my feet and ran.

The dead grass was slick with frost. My sneakers didn’t grip well. I slid and stumbled more than I actually sprinted, but I kept moving forward until my lungs burned.

The house loomed bigger with every step. Up close, it felt less like a building and more like a dead thing hunched in the field. The front door hung crooked on broken hinges. One of the front windows was boarded up; the others were just black.

I veered left at the last second, thinking I’d go around it, cut toward the road.

That’s when I saw the fence.

Someone had put up a line of metal posts and rusted wire along the far edge of the property. Not a solid fence—more like the start of one. But it was enough to slow me down, to scratch my hands as I grabbed and lifted the wire, to snag my jacket when I tried to duck under.

By the time I pulled free, I heard him again.

Closer now. On the porch.

The boards creaked under his weight. One. Two. Three steps. The sound of the carving fork gently tapping wood, like he was dragging the tines along the railing just to hear the noise.

I pressed myself against the side of the house, out of sight of the front. My breath came in sharp, loud gulps that I tried to smother with my sleeve.

“Everyone eats.”

The voice was low and dry. Not quite a whisper, not quite normal. It came from the front of the house, just around the corner.

“Everyone eats,” the voice said again. Like he was reciting something. “No empty chairs.”

He was talking to someone. Or to himself. Or to whoever he thought I was.

I took a slow step sideways, trying to edge away from the sound.

The porch boards creaked again. The steps were moving toward the corner.

There was a side door halfway down the house. I’d seen it before in daylight, driving past with my mom. The paint long gone, the frame soft. Now, in the dark, it gaped open a few inches. Black inside, but open.

I had two choices. Run back out into the field and hope I could outrun him in a straight line, or duck into the house and pray he went around the other way first.

The thought of stepping into that house made my stomach twist, but the idea of crossing that field again with him behind me made my legs lock.

I grabbed the handle and slipped inside.

The smell hit me first.

Old wood. Wet plaster. Something sour under it, like garbage that got wet and dried and got wet again.

The floor under my shoes felt uneven. I reached for the wall and found peeling wallpaper. My eyes strained in the dark until shapes came into focus.

A hallway. A doorway on the left opening into what might’ve been a kitchen. On the right, another room with what looked like a toppled bookshelf.

I heard the front door groan open.

“Everyone eats,” the Buckled Man said again, now inside the house. Closer. “Everyone gets a plate. Everyone gets a seat.”

His footsteps were slow. Heavy. Coming closer.

I slipped into the room on the left and froze.

A table filled most of the space. Not a dusty, rotten one. A cheap folding banquet table someone had set up recently.

On it:

Paper plates. Plastic cups. Two unlit candles stuck into old green candleholders. A grocery store turkey in its plastic bag, still raw, sitting in a roasting pan. Tins of instant mashed potatoes and stuffing. Cans of cranberry jelly. A bag of dinner rolls with the Greene’s price sticker still on them.

Every item had a sticky note in front of it with a name written in careful block letters.

“Mom.”
“Dad.”
“Grandma.”
“Me.”

I froze when I saw the last one.

“Kyle.”

The note sat in front of an empty, clean plate.

My plate.

My legs went weak. I put a hand on the back of one of the chairs to steady myself.

Something crinkled under my fingers.

I looked down.

The chairs around the table weren’t old farmhouse chairs. They were mismatched kitchen chairs. An office rolling chair with the fake leather flaking. A folding metal chair. Tied to the back of each one with twine were photographs.

Some printed on regular paper. Some glossy. Some ripped from family holiday cards.

In every picture, a Thanksgiving table.

Different families. Different houses. Different dishes. But always the same thing: a table full of people, everyone smiling at the camera.

On some, faces were crossed out with a black marker. On others, someone was circled.

My hand shook as I flipped through them.

Neighbors. People I recognized from school. People I’d seen in town in the cereal aisle.

Then I saw my family.

The photo was from three years ago. My mom had it framed on the mantle for a while. We were all squished around the table, me in a gray hoodie, my mom laughing, my dad pretending not to laugh, my little cousin with mashed potatoes on his shirt. Uncle Mark on the end, holding up his glass.

In this version, someone had drawn a thick, black X over my uncle’s face.

And a neat circle around mine.

I still know the exact way my own face looks in that circle. I’ve seen it enough in my head.

Footsteps sounded in the hallway.

“Smells good,” the Buckled Man said. “Smells like a full table. Smells like no one left out in the cold.”

They were slow. Heavy. Coming closer.

I slid down off the chair and crawled under the table. The floor was gritty with dirt and crumbs. I could see boots now at the doorway.

They were old-fashioned, square-toed, with tarnished buckles across the top. Dark leather cracked at the seams. Mud crusted around the soles.

He stepped into the room, and the whole table shook with his weight.

“I like this house,” he murmured. “I like a house that remembers. I like a table that’s ready.”

He walked slowly around the table, fingers trailing along the back of each chair. When he reached the one with my photo, he stopped.

“There’s my seat,” he said softly. “There’s my guest of honor.”

The carving fork clicked gently against the chairback.

I clamped a hand over my mouth.

“Come out, Kyle.”

He said my name like he’d been saying it all his life.

“I set a place for you. Your family didn’t.” The chair creaked as he pushed it in a little. “They left you out here, all alone. Didn’t move the chair. Didn’t set the plate. Didn’t keep the rules.”

He started walking again, slower now, listening.

“You know the rules, don’t you? You and your friends whisper them every year. You think they’re just a story.” He paused on the far side of the table. “Everyone eats. Every seat filled. No one turned away.”

He stopped directly across from where I hid.

The boots turned toward me.

I could see the hem of the coat now. Heavy fabric, stiff with age and grime. Dark stains along the edge, flaking at the creases.

The carving fork lowered until the tines hovered above the floor near my face.

“You came all this way,” he said. “Would be rude not to sit down.”

I exploded sideways before I could think.

I rolled out from under the table on the far side, grabbed the nearest chair, and flung it in his direction without looking.

It hit something solid with a loud crack. The fork clattered to the floor.

I ran.

Back into the hallway, toward where I thought the back of the house might be. My shoulder hit a doorframe. Pain shot down my arm. I staggered, bounced off the opposite wall, kept going.

Behind me, I heard the table screech and a low grunt.

“You run,” he said. “They all run.”

I don’t remember choosing to go down the stairs. One second I was in the hall, the next my foot found empty space and I was skidding down steep, narrow steps into the dark.

I hit the bottom hard enough that my teeth rattled. My ankle twisted. For a second, I lay there in the cold, dusty air, listening to my own wheezing and a faint hum from somewhere—maybe the extension strip.

Then I heard him again.

The slow thump of boots on stairs.

I pushed myself up.

The basement smelled worse. Damp concrete. Old mold. Something metallic that sat on the back of my tongue.

There was just enough light leaking through a tiny, ground-level window for me to make out shapes.

A workbench with tools hung neatly above it. Hooks hanging from a ceiling beam. Chains. A stained plastic folding table with an electric carving knife on it, the cord winding to an orange extension strip.

The hooks weren’t empty.

One had what looked like a whole, plucked turkey hanging from it, skin yellow and bumpy under the weak light. Next to it, something smaller. A shape about the size of a cat, skinless and pink, head missing.

Under that, on the floor, a single child’s sneaker. Muddy, the Nike logo half peeled off.

I swallowed something sour.

Boots hit the bottom step behind me.

“Basement’s best,” he said. “Nice and cool. Quiet. No one hears anything over the holiday noise upstairs.”

I lunged for the far wall. There was a low, square hole there. A coal chute. The wooden panel that had once covered it was half off, hanging by one rusted hinge. The opening wasn’t big, but I’m not huge. I dropped to my stomach, shoved the panel up with my shoulder, and wriggled through.

The concrete scraped my back. Nails snagged my clothes. I kicked and pushed until my shoulders wedged on the edges. For a panicked second I was stuck in the tight space.

Then I heard the carving fork scrape against the floor behind me.

“You don’t have to go,” he said. Closer now. “You just have to sit. One plate. One night. Then everyone’s even again.”

I screamed and kicked hard. Something tore—my jacket, my shirt, my skin—I don’t know. Suddenly I was free, tumbling onto cold, wet dirt outside.

I scrambled to my feet and ran.

The coal chute opened on the far side of the house, down in a little hollow. Dead leaves had collected there, matted with ice. The night air hit my scraped back and made it burn.

I sprinted up out of the hollow and into the field.

For a second, everything was open again. The sky dark overhead. The town’s distant streetlights a faint glow. Wind cutting through my torn clothes.

Behind me, I heard a hollow thud as something hit the coal chute from the inside.

Then the scrape of boots on concrete. Then on dirt.

I didn’t look back.

I ran straight for the road.

My ankle screamed with every step. My lungs burned. My side stabbed. I could feel blood running down my back in thin lines, soaking into my waistband.

I crashed through the tall grass and hit the ditch before the road without seeing it. My feet went out from under me. For a second I was in the air, then I hit muddy water and cold stones shoulder-first.

The shock of it stole my breath. The world shrank to the sound of my own gasp.

I pushed myself up on hands and knees and clawed my way up the far side of the ditch.

A pair of headlights washed over me.

I threw up my hands, blinking against the brightness.

Brakes squealed. A horn blared.

The car stopped a couple feet short of me.

The driver’s door flew open. “What the hell—Kyle?”

It was my dad.

He was out of the car and at my side in seconds, grabbing my shoulders, turning me to check for injuries.

“What are you doing?” he shouted. “What were you thinking, running into the road like that? You could’ve—Jesus.”

His hands came away dark from my back. For a second, he just stared at them.

“What happened?”

“He—” My throat seized. I coughed and spat mud and bile into the ditch. “He followed me. From the store. Through the woods. The house—there was a table—”

I turned back toward the field.

The farmhouse sat there, dark and still. No lights in the windows. No shape on the hill. The coal chute barely visible as a darker patch near the foundation.

The field was empty.

“Who?” my dad demanded. “Who followed you?”

“The Buckled Man,” I said before I could stop myself. “He said—he set a place—he knew my name. He had pictures, Dad. He had our picture. He circled me.”

My dad stared at me like I’d started speaking another language.

Then something changed in his face. Just a flicker.

“Get in the car,” he said. “Now.”

He kept glancing past me at the field like he expected something to step out of it.

The rest of the night is a blur of bright lights and questions.

My mom cried and kept touching my face like she needed to make sure it was still there. My dad called the cops. They came, took statements, took pictures of the cuts on my back and the mud on my clothes.

One of the officers wrote “possible fall injury” on his notepad before I even finished talking.

Two officers drove out to Yates Field to check the house.

They came back about an hour later. The TV was still on mute in the living room, showing some late-night infomercial about knives, which felt like a bad joke.

“Basement had some old tools,” one of them said. “Some hooks, probably for hanging game. Nothing unusual for a farmhouse out here. No fresh food, no photos, nothing like what you described. Just junk.”

“That’s impossible,” I said. My voice sounded thin. “It was there. The table was set. There were plates, names—”

“Kid, we looked,” he said. “Top to bottom. House is falling in on itself, but there’s nothing in there you need to worry about.”

He gave me the careful look adults give when they think you’re lying or hysterical but don’t want to say so.

“Probably a trespasser messing with you,” he added. “Someone heard the local legend and wanted to scare kids. You were running in the woods in the dark. Adrenaline does weird things to your memory.”

I wanted to scream.

Instead, I sat there on the couch, wrapped in a blanket that smelled like our attic, feeling every cut on my back itch and sting. My dad kept pacing. My mom made tea and forgot to drink hers.

After the officers left, my parents went into the kitchen and had the quietest, angriest fight I’ve ever heard.

I didn’t catch every word. I caught enough.

“You told him that story when he was little, what did you expect?” my dad hissed. “Now some lunatic’s using it.”

“This isn’t about a story!” my mom snapped back. “This is about you refusing to see that your brother—”

“He threw a chair at our son, Marie!”

“And now our son is bleeding because you didn’t move a damn chair!”

Silence. Then my dad, low: “You think this is my fault?”

A cabinet door shut too hard. A mug rattled in the sink.

I went upstairs before I had to hear more.

I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the boots at the edge of the table. The fork lowering toward my face. My name on that sticky note.

At some point, maybe around three in the morning, I heard it.

Three slow knocks on the front door.

Not loud. Not frantic. Just firm.

My parents must’ve heard it too. I heard my dad’s steps on the stairs, then my mom’s soft protest.

“Don’t,” she whispered. “Don’t answer.”

“It’s probably the officers,” my dad said. “Maybe they forgot something.”

The front door creaked open.

Silence.

Then my dad’s voice, sharp. “Hello?”

More silence.

The door closed again.

He came back upstairs a minute later. I cracked my bedroom door and peeked out.

“Who was it?” my mom asked.

“No one,” he said. He looked pale. “Probably kids. No one on the porch.”

He avoided my eyes. He does that thing where he rubs the bridge of his nose when he’s lying. He was doing that.

The next day, my mom moved the folding chair from the end of the table. She put it in the garage. She set the table for three instead of four.

She called my Uncle Mark and invited him for “dessert and coffee sometime next week.” Not Thanksgiving. Not dinner. A compromise.

He didn’t come.

Every year before that, Thanksgiving smelled like turkey and pie and sounded like football and laughter and my mom yelling at my dad about using the good knife on the carving board.

Last year, it tasted like cold gravy and fear.

I picked at my food and watched the front door.

I slept with my bedroom door locked for months. I still do.

I know what people are going to say.

Stress. Family drama. Darkness. Overactive imagination. Urban legend in my head. Every year, kids around here swear they see someone on the side of the road in a long coat near Thanksgiving.

Maybe that’s all it is.

But here’s what hasn’t gone away:

The scars on my back from where the coal chute ripped my skin. They’re crooked and shiny and I see them every time I forget and take my shirt off in front of the bathroom mirror.

The way my phone, which had thirty percent battery when I left the store, wouldn’t turn on again until the next morning, and then suddenly booted up like nothing happened.

The report my dad found buried in the town archive when he couldn’t sleep one night. An old clipping about a man named Gideon Yates found dead in his field, “frozen in the posture of supplication,” and a side note about “local superstitions regarding holiday hospitality.” He didn’t show me the whole article, just read parts of it out loud and then went quiet.

The fact that a couple days after the police “found nothing” in the Yates house, it burned down in the middle of the night.

Electrical fire, they said on the local news. Old wiring. Whole place went up. No one inside. Case closed.

And the way my dad flinches now whenever anyone jokes about “just one empty chair.” He did it in Price Chopper last week when some lady in front of us said that, and he dropped a can of corn.

It’s the day before Thanksgiving again as I’m writing this.

My parents invited me to come home. They promised to “do things differently.” They said we could talk about Uncle Mark and the chair and everything. My mom texted me a photo of the table already set, every seat filled, like proof.

I told them I’m spending it with my aunt instead. Her table is small, but every seat will be filled. No one is left out. She even pulled up a random folding chair just so there’d be literally zero gaps. It looks stupid, but I didn’t say anything.

Even then, I keep looking at the door.

If your family has someone they’re “not ready to see,” that’s between you and them. I get it. Sometimes people are dangerous. Sometimes boundaries are necessary. My uncle really did throw a chair at me; that part isn’t made up.

But if you’ve got an empty chair this week, maybe think hard about why it’s empty.

And if you hear slow footsteps behind you on a cold November night, or knocks at your door after midnight that don’t sound urgent, just patient—

Maybe don’t answer.

Everyone eats.
Everyone gets a seat.

You just don’t want to find out what happens when someone like him decides you’re the one he’s saving a plate for.",17,1764188173.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False
1p7i8ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreFans/comments/1p7i8ly/aita_for_snapping_at_my_classmate/,AITA for snapping at my classmate?,"Hi guys. This is a throwaway account,and also my first time posting, as i’ve been having some issues and feel like this is a safe space to put this up.  Also, sorry this is so long. I (16Nonbinary), and Lisa (fake name,16F) are classmates. I came out to her, as she used to be my best friend, last year as nonbinary and bisexual (which was very hard for me).  That was, in January. In Febuary, I broke up with my at the time boyfriend of a 8 months, as i felt I was a little suffocated.  
For some context, Lisa and i go to the same school, and have been friends since 3rd grade. My school is very small, so everyone knows everyone. I also do theatre (yes im a theatre kid) with Lisa, and some of the kids from my theatre group are in my class.

Now, back to the story. In March, I had some issues with my friends, and march-april had close to no friends. It was around this time, when i got diagnosed with my anxiety disorde, and Lisa  knew this. In May, i met Mark (16M) at a coffee shop, and we instantly hit it off.  A few weeks later, he asks me to be his girlfriend (i was not out to him), and the (literally) first thing i did was call Lisa and tell her. She was, extatic. This was when, I also reconnected with some old friends of mine. Me and one of those friends, went shopping, and they were trying on some clothes. Lisa called me, and I answered, while shopping with that friend. At some point in our call, she heard me say, That looks so good on you, and Your so cute in that. That was innocent shopping with my friend. She misunderstood that, and guess what?! The next day, i get a call from Mark, who was practically yelling at me, and told me we were over. I was on vacation at the time, and only saw the text from Lisa later, who was apologizing and saying how she didn’t know and thought i cheated. These texts will be provided.

The next week, one of my theatre group friends had a party, where I left a couple hours early. The next day, after that party, as i’m reading our group chat, i realized someone said something about me at the party. I texted Lisa, who told me “Whatever happens in Marks house, stays in his house”. Yes, that was Marks party. I texted Mark, who hadn’t blocked me, who told me the same thing. By that point, i had already figured out that they were badmouthing me about me being Bi.

This is where it gets interesting. On Monday in school, Lisa, as she’s in my class, told some other classmates that i’m Bi. I came up to her, when i found out she did that and practically yelled “What is wrong with you” in her face. She also said that same thing (referring to my gender and sexuality). After that we went no contact for a little while. Later o, I texted her, asking why she did it (all of that) and she said it’s because I told my class about her and her ex boyfriend. For some more context here, Lisa had a boyfriend, and she got mildly bullied for it at school, with people teasing her about him. I told her i did no such thing, and that if anything, I have the right for being mad at her, as I got teased for my ex (yes she told my class about him). I got mad at her, and haven’t texted her since. Come September of this year, and she hates me now. She has started making comments, about my appearance (i have a more Alt style, and dyed hair) and practically turned my entire class against me. Because of this my mental health has gotten really bad. Yesterday, i couldnt take it anymore, and snapped. When she made her first comment, i told her how she was wierd for saying that and that i got used to it and she should too, and some other things. She started crying and ran out of the classroom. I feel kinda bad, but idk, so here i am.

So, AITA for snapping at my classmate?

(Also,Charlotte if your reading this im a huge fan)

Here are the apology texts she sent:

Edit: Lisa, after she did it, promised she would never do it again. Also, when i yelled at her, I also talked to her mom, who is a teacher at my school. Did i go too far?",2,1764188169.0,CharlotteDobreFans,0,1.0,False

I stand there, half-crazed from the interstate, pupils still dilated from too much coffee and not enough sleep, clutching my ticket for a six-piece chicken tender basket (the last refuge of the damned in this godforsaken Oregon strip-mall wilderness). The meal comes with fries, a side of existential dread, and, allegedly, condiments.
But no. Not here. Not under his watch.
He is a gaunt figure in a hairnet, eyes like burnt holes in a blanket, moving with the mechanical precision of a man who has seen the abyss and decided to make it his bitch. I ask—politely, mind you, because I am still clinging to the ragged edges of civilization—for ketchup. Just enough to drown the taste of regret and fryer grease.
He slides one (ONE) solitary packet across the counter like he’s passing me a single bullet in a war zone.
“One,” he rasps, voice like gravel soaked in lemon juice. “That’s the rule.”
One packet. For six pieces of chicken. For a mountain of fries that could choke a lesser man. One red teardrop of Heinz in a world gone mad.
I stare at it. The packet stares back, smug and inadequate. This is not rationing. This is psychological warfare. This is a man who has looked into the heart of American excess and said, “No. You will suffer.”
I try reason. I try charm. I try the wild-eyed desperation of a man who has driven 400 miles on black coffee and fury. Nothing. He guards the ketchup dispenser like it’s the last vial of pure morphine on death row. You want more? You fill out a form. You wait three to five business days. You renounce your worldly possessions and take a vow of silence.
I consider lunging across the counter, seizing the sacred red pump, baptizing the entire deli in a glorious crimson flood while screaming about freedom and the pursuit of happiness. But the cameras are watching. The Karens are watching. And somewhere, in the back, a manager with a clipboard is already writing me up as a “disruptive condiment enthusiast.”
So I take my single packet. I slink to a booth that smells faintly of bleach and broken dreams. I tear it open with my teeth like an animal. I ration that pathetic crimson smear across six pieces of chicken the way a junkie rations his last bindle in the desert.
It is not enough. It will never be enough.
Ray’s Food Place has broken stronger men than me. Somewhere out there, lost souls wander the parking lot at 2 a.m., shaking empty ketchup packets at the moon, howling for one more hit of that sweet, sweet tomato heroin.
The Sauce Nazi has won again.

# FAQ

**Are Black Friday espresso machine deals actually worth it in 2025?**

Yes – especially on Amazon this year. The Philips 3200 espresso machine deal is already live at $499 (38% off). This is the lowest price in 2 years. But you need to watch out for listings that inflate prices before the sale. The deals I listed above are verified against historical pricing.

**What should I look for before buying an espresso machine?**

Key things to consider:

* **Bar pressure**: 15-20 bar is standard for home machines
* **Build quality**: Stainless steel > plastic
* **Milk frothing**: Auto frother vs manual steam wand (manual gives more control)
* **Grinder**: Built-in vs separate (separate is usually better quality)
* **Size**: Measure your counter space first

**Semi-automatic vs fully automatic – which is better?**

Semi-automatic (like Breville Barista Express): You control the shot – more hands-on, better learning curve, typically better shots once you dial it in.

Fully automatic (like Philips 3200): Press button, get coffee. Less control but way more convenient. Better for people who just want good coffee without the ritual.

**Is the Ninja Luxe Café actually good?**

Yeah, it's legit. The Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier is the best bang for the buck espresso machine on the market today. It's cold milk froth ability alone is a major standout. The 3-in-1 functionality (espresso + drip + cold brew) is genuinely useful if you drink different styles.

Hope this guide helps anyone searching for **black friday espresso machine deals 2025 amazon**, **best espresso machine black friday**, or **espresso machine discounts USA**. I'll continue to update this article as better deals appear closer to Black Friday and through Cyber Monday.

The Philips 3200 at 50% off is probably the standout deal this year – It's the lowest price of 2025. If you've been waiting for a fully automatic machine, this is your moment.
