I used to have a cup of hot coffee every morning but ever since I started Ozempic my body refuses to accept it. Every single time I've gotten sick after. I've switched to drinking Reign energy drinks in the morning before work because my stomach is able to tolerate it, but they're expensive and horrid for my health. I'm writing this post because after two weeks of not risking the coffee I tried again this morning only to get sick again.
 
Has anyone else experienced this reaction to coffee? Is there something I can take that will make my stomach tolerate it? I miss the comfort of a nice hot cup with hazelnut creamer in the morning! ",1,1743264547.0,Ozempic,0,1.0,False

1jmpnk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1jmpnk1/ive_been_trying_to_label_my_emotions_but_my/,"I've been trying to label my emotions but my actions stay the same, can you give me some tips?","I have been trying to use this set:


I am feeling _
It makes sense that I am feeling _, because _ has just happened, and it reminds me of _.
This emotion is telling me to _ because _.
They have a point (so/but) _.


Ex. I am feeling frightened, attacked, offended and frustrated. 

It makes sense because this medical professional has misinterpreted me multiple times and is visibly annoyed or worse, and it reminds me of all the times I asked for help as a child and was severely punished, as well as getting the bs diagnosis that has been the reason behind this similar treatment I've been receiving for years. 

And that everyone defends and praises these people despite the harm they've caused me and many, many others so getting help from others will likely cause a similar reaction (as proved by other clinics, family, and reddit over and over again). And that there are no alternatives to care outside harmful antivacs types. 

This emotion is telling me to stop trying and run away because it will either cause more harm or just waste time.  

They have a point..

So I will politely go along with whatever the professional says, leave and never come back (is it a lost cause? Is there another place to try after trying to make your point clearer after this? Has trying to make your point clearer worked at any point?)

But ‚Ä¶? (You're just being a stupid bitch and deserve the harm, if everyone does this it means they're right and you deserve it, they side with your parents and the one who hits you is dead so you deserve the creepy behaviour because no one will ever believe you unless you cling to the rbn people who have their own scariness) if you don't keep trying you won't get help? (Have you ever gotten real help? Not just obligation bait and punishment? Not just a reason for your abusers to feel superior and kind?) Is the help you may receive worth the risk? Are there alternatives? (Red bull, coffee, Tylenol/advil in rotation, diy? Do you have the drive to figure out how to access diy?)

I can pick out the negative things and validate that they're not fair to me or that there are cases where people support others or get help, but it's still a case of run away, or give up, comply and leave disappointed and hopeless. I'm not sure if this isn't right for me or if I'm doing it wrong, can you give me some tips if you have any? TIA

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

1. The wedding invitation: ""together with our family / some text here / Derika Tendy / G / Fiance Orion / place holder text / wedding / cas wed"" (I assume the ""G"" was used because it looks kind of like an ampersand.)

2. The sedan chair: ""this is a very fancy chair""

5. Ship graveyard: ""Kat \[?\] / orbit / caution - no ent\[ry\]"" (perhaps the unknown letter is a J, Q, or Z)

‚∏ª

I have a story for you. And it‚Äôs serious. Well‚Ä¶ not really. It‚Äôs just for laughs, but it‚Äôs also serious.

The other day, my friend and I were doing what we do best‚Äîanalyzing Joong and Est like it‚Äôs our full-time job. And out of nowhere, she drops a bomb on me:

‚ÄúJoong should have already proposed to Est.‚Äù

I laughed. I thought she was joking. But her face was as serious as a lawyer‚Äôs.

So, naturally, I tried to be reasonable:

‚ÄúBut wait‚Ä¶ Joong just turned 24, and Est is still 23.‚Äù

And she, without a second of hesitation:

‚ÄúAnd? What‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I realized I was dealing with a hardcore advocate for early marriage, a devoted missionary of early marriage I swear.

She continued, fully convinced:

‚ÄúIf they love each other, what‚Äôs the point of waiting? What are they waiting for? Other people get married at 18, 19, and their marriages last! Actually, the sooner you get married, the sooner you build everything together.‚Äù

She sounded so confident I started questioning my own logic.

But I still had one last argument up my sleeve:

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ they still live with their parents.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt even flinch.

‚ÄúAnd? That‚Äôs exactly why they should start saving now. If I were Joong, I‚Äôd already be proposing before someone else snatches Est away.‚Äù

At that moment, I knew this wasn‚Äôt just a random conversation.

Then, a thought hit me. Why does Joong have to be the one to propose? Why not Est?

So, I asked.

Big mistake.

She looked at me like I had just committed the biggest crime of the century.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ actually think Est would propose to Joong?‚Äù

I blinked. The silence was heavy.

She sighed and shook her head, like she had just realized I was a lost cause.

‚ÄúEst‚Ä¶ who won‚Äôt even flirt with a guy properly. Est‚Ä¶ who refuses to say ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô first. Est‚Ä¶ who loses all his composure whenever Joong does something cute. And you think he‚Äôs going to get down on one knee in front of a man and propose? Never.‚Äù

I shut up. Because she was absolutely right.

Then she went in for the kill:

‚ÄúWhat is Joong waiting for? Is he planning to date for 10 years and then propose at 27? He‚Äôs getting older, you know?‚Äù

At that moment, I lost it.

And then she hit me with the final blow:

‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm telling you, he needs to hurry up. Because guys like Est? They don‚Äôt stay on the market for long. One day, someone more patient, more romantic will come along and poof! Joong will be crying.‚Äù

I was defeated.

But I had one last desperate attempt:

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ they have careers to build.‚Äù

She laughed. A deep, knowing laugh.

‚ÄúAnd? Since when does marriage stop you from building a career? If anything, you build even better when you have a partner supporting you.‚Äù

I raised my hands in surrender. I had nothing left.

Every argument I had? She shut them down in 2 seconds.

And you know what? I‚Äôm not even against it.

Because she‚Äôs kind of right. When you marry young, you grow together, you learn together. It saves you from wasting 10 years just ‚Äúseeing if it works.‚Äù

But hey, maybe we think this way because we come from a culture where getting married early is normal.

Still‚Ä¶ I you read this Joong, think about it.

If someone else takes Est, you‚Äôre gonna cry.

Anyway, just a funny story. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇBut‚Ä¶ 

When she was done dismantling all my arguments against immediate marriage, she took an even more serious tone. Like she was about to give me the key to the universe.

She looked at me, very seriously, and said:

‚ÄúDo you know why marriage is the key?‚Äù

Na√Øve as I was, I thought she was going to talk about romance, vows, beautiful speeches in the rain. No.

She shrugged, as if she was about to reveal the ultimate truth.

‚ÄúBecause in a marriage, you can‚Äôt just leave. That‚Äôs not an option. You can‚Äôt just wake up one morning, say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm over it‚Äô and pack your bags. You can‚Äôt just slam the door and say ‚ÄòCiao, I‚Äôm out‚Äô because you made a vow. You swore.‚Äù

I laughed. I thought she was joking.

She was not joking.

She kept going, with a voice filled with divine wisdom:

‚ÄúWho did you swear to? To God, to the law, to your parents, to your family, to the spirits, to the mystical forces, to entities you don‚Äôt even understand! Do you think you can just leave? NO.‚Äù

At that moment, I fell silent. Because‚Ä¶ she was right.

She nodded, satisfied. Then, she continued, with an even more serious tone:

‚ÄúImmaturity? It does not exist in marriage. You learn to grow up. You learn to endure. Because you see, Est NEEDS to learn to grow up. He needs an environment where running away is not an option.‚Äù

At this point, I felt myself fully agreeing with her reasoning.

But she wasn‚Äôt done yet.

‚ÄúIn marriage, you don‚Äôt play with relationships. You don‚Äôt break up impulsively just because of an argument. You think twice, three times, a thousand times. Why? Because you have kids. Because you have pets. Because you have furniture you bought together, Netflix subscriptions, life insurance, shared debts, a coffee machine!‚Äù

I blinked.

‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs easy to leave when you have a coffee machine? Do you think this kind of commitment is nothing? NO.‚Äù

I started laughing. But she was on a divine mission.

‚ÄúMarriage is where you learn patience. It‚Äôs where you learn to truly love each other. Because you can date for ten years, but if you haven‚Äôt lived together, you don‚Äôt know each other. It‚Äôs when you live with someone that you truly know if they‚Äôre your soulmate or not, you‚Äôll see if your love is real or just a beautiful illusion.

I wanted to argue.

She raised a hand, like she was about to drop the ultimate truth.

‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs a cultural thing. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äòwe marry young in our culture.‚Äô No. It‚Äôs universal. That‚Äôs just how it works, period.‚Äù

At this point, I was exhausted.

But she went in for the final blow.

‚ÄúDo you know what happens when two souls are bound by marriage?‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúThey are blessed. Their life progresses. Their careers take off. Their businesses thrive. This isn‚Äôt a theory, it‚Äôs a fact of life. Couples who marry and stay together, they succeed. Because the universe blesses them. God, the law, and the universe, you are blessed. Everything flows. It‚Äôs energy, it‚Äôs spiritual. This isn‚Äôt a theory, it‚Äôs the truth.‚Äù

I laughed. But she was dead serious.

And then, she dropped the bomb.

‚ÄúWhy wait until you‚Äôre 30? Why waste so much time? Look at Millie Bobby Brown, she went for it. And she‚Äôs happy. Why wouldn‚Äôt Joong and Est?‚Äù**

At this point, I was completely defeated.

And that‚Äôs when I thought of Joong.

Joong, I know you‚Äôre reading this.

Don‚Äôt take my friend too seriously.

Even though‚Ä¶ I completely agree with her.

‚ÄúIs it a cultural thing? Maybe. But honestly‚Ä¶ I think your culture is the same. It‚Äôs just a different way of thinking.‚Äù

But hey, don‚Äôt take it too seriously.

But if you want to‚Ä¶

You can propose to Est.

He won‚Äôt say no.

I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt say no.

And honestly, couples who marry young‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre beautiful.

Be an exception.

Shock the crowd.

Shock your families.

Shock your friends.

Do something special.

Stand out.

Because Joong‚Ä¶

You‚Äôre not someone who stays in the ordinary.

So‚Ä¶

Stand out.

My move-in date is flexible, and I can move anywhere between april 15 - end of may. Would like to be locked down before memorial day weekend. 

I am looking for a roommate to search with or a room to move into in an apartment with 1-2 female roommates. Aiming for UES/Yorkville, UWS, Hell's Kitchen, Fidi, Sutton place, tbh manhattan generally below 92nd street.  

About me: 

I am a 32F, I work in entertainment law and am in office 4 days of the week, wfh 1 day. I am a clean, considerate roommate and looking for someone who is the same. I am gluten free and semi-vegetarian (I only eat chicken and turkey meat wise). My hobbies are watching comedies, going to baseball games, reading, playing tennis, and baking gluten free goodies (mostly in the winter, I always share!!). I tend to keep to myself, but would love to be friendly with my roommate(s) and would love to have open communication.

I come with furniture, a beautiful pink couch, coffee table, side tables - my style is english garden and I have really pretty aesthetic things that make the apt look beautiful. Obviously would love to work with a roommate to curate a style and incorporate all of our things we have to make us both comfortable. 

My Budget for my share: $2000

My Must haves: laundry in the building and an ac unit capable room, apartment above the ground floor. 

My would really likes to have: dishwasher, package room, ac in the room. 

My cannots: No one who brings the party home, no flex rooms, and minimal overnight guests. 

DM me on if we align on anything and I'd love to set up a facetime.

The only light in the telescope room was her laptop softly illuminating her face as it crunched the raw numbers collected by the telescope in real time. She struggled to keep her eyes open as she faced the glowing rectangle in her lap like it held all the secrets of the universe. She heard the faint sound of footsteps crunching on the gravel outside, and then the door swinging open. ‚ÄúHi Scott!‚Äù she said, without turning around, stifling a yawn.

‚ÄúHey, guess what? We have the rest of the night!‚Äù said Scott cheerfully, plonking himself into a chair next to Lauren.

‚ÄúWhat? How?‚Äù asked Lauren, ‚ÄúI thought someone else booked this telescope.‚Äù

‚ÄúI may have talked to some people and traded some telescope time to hog it for a bit longer,‚Äù¬† admitted Scott slyly.

‚ÄúWhat? You didn‚Äôt! Thank you!‚Äù said Lauren.

Scott shrugged. ‚ÄúI wanna see where this is going. It‚Äôs interesting,‚Äù he said.

‚Äú*You‚Äôre* interesting,‚Äù said Lauren.

The minutes and hours ticked by in the darkness with only the tapping of keys and the occasional tiny movements of the telescope repositioning itself. At some point, Lauren drifted off and Scott reached out to grab her laptop before it fell. As he watched the latest batch of numbers come in, his eyes steadily grew wider and his fingers flew over the keyboard, running scripts and plugging numbers into the calculator. At last, he stopped, slack-jawed, and a palpable silence fell over the room, punctuated only by Lauren‚Äôs deep breathing and the occasional mechanical noise from the telescope.

Scott reached over and touched Lauren‚Äôs shoulder, gently shaking her awake. She felt warm somehow, despite the chilly wind outside. ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶what? Oh shit, did I fall asleep?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve finished triangulating your X-ray emitters. Their current position is over 100 AU from Earth. Oh and both of them have an identical heading,‚Äù said Scott.

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù said Lauren. Scott could practically feel her eyes boring into him in the dark.  
  
  
  
Scott took a deep breath. ‚ÄúThe current velocity is roughly one percent of light speed,‚Äù he said.  
  
  
  
‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù said Lauren. In a quick motion, she snatched the laptop back from Scott, looking intently at the screen. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶,‚Äù she murmured. At last she turned back to Scott. ‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt many natural objects that move that quickly. Even fewer that fit the profile we‚Äôve seen here. Maybe a pair of primordial black holes orbiting each other,‚Äù she said softly, almost reverently. ‚ÄúThat somehow got, I don‚Äôt know, ejected from the galactic core without losing each other and just traveled across the galaxy together. I‚Äôll have to run the numbers and see if that‚Äôs possible or‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† she trailed off.  
  
  
  
‚ÄúOr it‚Äôs a new type of celestial object entirely. Xie-Watson Objects. XWOs. Has a nice ring to it,‚Äù said Scott.  
  
  
  
Lauren facepalmed and let out an exaggerated groan, though Scott caught a hint of a smile. ‚ÄúGive me a break!‚Äù she said.  
  
  
  
They continued tracking the pair of X-ray emitters until they disappeared below the horizon, and then begrudgingly vacated the observatory and continued crunching numbers in the office for the rest of the night. At¬† some point, Scott made a Latex document entitled ‚ÄúA Pair of Co-Moving Hypervelocity X-ray Emitters in the Oort Cloud‚Äù-- ‚Äúsuch a momentous title‚Äù, Lauren had¬† said.  
  
  
  
By sunrise, they found themselves in town, ordering coffee and breakfast from a random diner. Much to Scott‚Äôs chagrin, there was no indoor seating, but at Lauren‚Äôs suggestion, they sat down at a bench in a small park, watching the sunrise trickling through a stand of pines. ‚ÄúI think we gotta tell someone, Scott,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, NASA? The government? This could be bigger than us. We know it‚Äôs moving straight towards the inner Solar System. That there‚Äôs a nonzero chance that whatever it is, it could hit Earth. And with how fast it‚Äôs going‚Ä¶‚Äù She shivered, and it wasn‚Äôt entirely from the early-morning cold.  
  
  
  
‚ÄúTen to the minus five percent according to my simulations,‚Äù said Scott.  
  
  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not zero,‚Äù said Lauren.  
  
  
  
Scott sighed heavily and took a bite of his bagel, staring moodily into the trees. ‚ÄúHave you ever been scooped, Lauren?‚Äù She shook her head. ‚ÄúGood. I hope you never do. Really. I mean it. You deserve better.‚Äù Scott went on, ‚ÄúBut trust me on this. I‚Äôve been doing this a while and when you find something big‚Äìand believe me, this is big‚Äìyou publish early, publish often, and don‚Äôt let anyone take it away from you because if they get a chance, they will.‚Äù  
  
  
  
‚ÄúI thought we were all supposed to come together and figure out the universe and our place in it,‚Äù said Lauren.  
  
  
  
‚ÄúYeah, I thought so too,‚Äù said Scott bitterly, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre special, you know that? We need more people like you. A pity they all get crushed these days.‚Äù He drained his coffee cup¬† and crumpled it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rat race, that‚Äôs what it is. I had a call with my department chair yesterday, you know. Apparently my publication count ‚Äòneeds to be higher to be considered for tenure‚Äô. Did it matter what‚Äôs in those publications? Do you think anyone reads them? No. They just count them. This is all just a dick-measuring contest.‚Äù

Lauren slumped backwards against the bench, wrapping her arms around herself, her face bearing an expression of utter defeat. Scott inched closer, unable to take his eyes off her face. A million thoughts raced through his mind like trains on a tangle of crisscrossing tracks until at last, in one abrupt, jerky motion, he put an arm around her shoulders. She slid closer to him, wordlessly.

‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre in a good position. I know we have something real here,‚Äù said Scott. Lauren glanced at him. ‚ÄúWe can dash off this paper before anyone else does, and you know what? With everything we have, we can break it down into *at least* two or three publications in top journals. Maybe more, if we keep looking into this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to keep looking into this. But we‚Äôre gonna need a bigger telescope,‚Äù cut in Lauren, ‚ÄúAnd more time on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can get us that. It‚Äôll take some schmoozing, but I‚Äôll do it,‚Äù said Scott.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù said Lauren. She shifted uncomfortably, looking for words. ‚ÄúBut still‚Ä¶this might not be just a weird blip in the sky. It might actually matter. For normal people, not just us. And dealing with that as just the two of us‚Ä¶it scares me. Excites me a little, but also scares me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be just the two of us,‚Äù said Scott, ‚Äúas soon as we publish the results. It‚Äôs a win-win situation. I get tenure. You get a tenure-track position at a top university.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that really guaranteed?‚Äù asked Lauren warily. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried so many times and it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶nothing, anywhere. Tenure-track, not tenure-track, whatever. It‚Äôs like screaming into the void and getting radio silence back. And I‚Äôm almost done with my dissertation and it just feels like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a cliff at one percent of light speed and now there are these things hurtling towards us at one percent of light speed and‚Ä¶‚Äù she trailed off into silence.

Scott wrapped his arm tighter around you. ‚ÄúNo. Nothing is. But I meant what I said‚Ä¶you‚Äôre special.‚Äù

Lauren was silent for a long moment. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said at last, quietly.

Scott nodded. ‚ÄúGreat. So for the related work‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNot now. Let‚Äôs just enjoy the moment,‚Äù said Lauren. She stared at him. ‚ÄúDo you play RPGs?‚Äù

The conversation swerved to lighter matters until they finished their food and stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúI have to get some sleep, but do you wanna meet up later and start writing?‚Äù Scott said.

‚ÄúI can start. You should get *more* rest. And maybe check in on your son?‚Äù said Lauren.

‚ÄúAh. Right,‚Äù said Scott, ‚ÄúTomorrow then?‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù agreed Lauren. Just before she turned to leave, Scott stepped forward and wrapped her in an embrace. As they held each other, he stared into her eyes, his thoughts once again like too many trains on intersecting tracks. He felt like many forces were pulling him in mysterious directions, but before he could solve for all of them, Lauren solved them for him with a quick peck on the lips. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúFor being you.‚Äù And with that, she was gone, leaving Scott with his thoughts to derail and crash into each other.",3,1743263448.0,roadtohope,0,1.0,False

Maybe because I never thought I‚Äôd get here. Maybe because someone out there needs to hear it. But if you‚Äôre struggling with social anxiety, read this till the end.

I was that guy. The one who panicked at the thought of raising his hand in class. The one who rehearsed saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to the cashier but still messed it up. The one who turned down party invites, not because I didn‚Äôt want to go, but because I was terrified of what I‚Äôd say‚Äîor worse‚Äîwhat I wouldn‚Äôt say.

It wasn‚Äôt just shyness. It was crippling.

People used to joke, ‚ÄúWhy are you so quiet?‚Äù They had no idea that inside, my heart was racing like I was about to face a firing squad. I thought, Maybe I‚Äôm just broken. Maybe I‚Äôll never be normal.

And then came the worst moment of my life.

I was at a family wedding. My mom forced me to go. I sat in the corner, gripping my drink like it was a life raft. Then it happened. My uncle‚Äîwho I hadn‚Äôt seen in years‚Äîcalled my name.

‚ÄúCome here! Meet everyone!‚Äù

Everyone. At once. Looking at me.

I walked over like I was heading to my execution. My legs felt stiff, my mouth dry. Then, the nightmare:

Someone said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so awkward.‚Äù

Everyone laughed. I did too, pretending it didn‚Äôt cut me in half.

That night, I locked myself in my room and did something I hadn‚Äôt done in years. I cried. I wasn‚Äôt even sad‚ÄîI was furious. At myself. At the world. At my stupid brain for making something as simple as talking feel like climbing Everest.

And then I found it.

Scrolling Reddit, I saw a post about something called ""The Process.""

I don‚Äôt know who created it. Some people say it was developed by psychologists. Others say it was just some guy who figured it out and shared it online. But it wasn‚Äôt like the ‚Äújust be confident, bro‚Äù advice I hated. It was a system. A way to rewire my brain step by step.

I told myself: One last try. If this doesn‚Äôt work, I accept my fate.

The first challenge? Order coffee and say one extra sentence to the barista.

I nearly bailed. But then I thought about that wedding. About the life I‚Äôd have if I didn‚Äôt change. And I did it. I stuttered. I turned red. But I did it.

Then came the real battle.

Week after week, the challenges got harder.

Compliment a stranger.

Walk into a room like you belong there.

Hold eye contact for 3 seconds longer than you‚Äôre comfortable with.


Some days, I wanted to quit. But every time I completed a challenge, it felt like I was breaking chains I never knew I had.

And then, it happened.

A month later, I was at another event. A small get-together. Someone asked me a question.

And I answered.

Not in a whisper. Not looking at the floor. Like a normal f*cking person.

That night, I sat in my car and just exhaled. Because for the first time in my life, I wasn‚Äôt drowning.

I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù I still had awkward moments. But for the first time, I realized: It wasn‚Äôt about being fearless. It was about showing up, even when I was scared.

Today, I have friends who actually know me, not just the anxious shell of me. I go out. I speak up. And if you‚Äôre where I was? Listen to me:

You are not broken. You are not doomed. You are just untrained.

And The Process? It‚Äôs out there. Find it. Try it.

1. Why do you guys have such a disturbed sleep routine? Is it because of your peers who have normalised this type of routine or Exams / Reels addiction?

Speaking of DeLuca's... I had a macchiato there the other day and it was probably the best coffee that I've ever tasted.",2,1743262928.0,Winnipeg,15,0.67,False

What if we had a place (maybe a wiki?) where anyone could post their homebrew rules, subsystem, or even SRD to share with the community? Anyone could post comments and suggestions for the authors. Maybe it would even be possible to have a ""like"" or upvote system to help elevate rule sets that a lot of people appreciate.


Does anyone here know of a resource like that? It feels like a typical wiki format could work well. Looks like there are free wiki hosting services, but I'm not familiar with them.


I'm thinking about it because I'd be interested in posting my homebrew for discussion. It'll never be a product; I'm never going to do nice formatting or art; it's just rules I'm trying out at the table. I didn't want to expose my Google account id by putting it there. It's not worth putting on a site like Itch.io. I'd take advantage of an easy way to post it, so that I can refer to it in discussions here in r/osr.

1jmp1h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jmp1h3/struggling_to_get_into_ketosis/,Struggling to get into ketosis,"Hello everyone about a month ago I was on a work trip and was eating carnivore all day and for desert I would have one of those keto pint ice cream bars. I wasn‚Äôt thinking about keto, I wasn‚Äôt tracking or counting anything, I was walking a lot every day and not eating about 7 hours in between lunch and dinner. I felt incredible like my mind was sharp and I wasn‚Äôt hungry. I was having stressful dreams though. I felt like I was in ketosis but I‚Äôm wondering if it was just my cortisol being high. I wasn‚Äôt eating any carbs besides net carbs in that ice cream bars. I ate carbs when I got back home but after a few days I wanted to get back to that feeling I had on my work trip so I did research and realized I was probably in ketosis and that I wanted to get back into it. I started eating as much fat as I could, like trying to get to 200 grams but I‚Äôd end up around 180. I wasn‚Äôt having any carbs, basically eating the same way as I was on my work trip but more fat because I thought that‚Äôs what I needed. I ended up eating around 2000-25000 calories a day. 2 weeks I didn‚Äôt get into ketosis once and I gained weight. I am trying a different approach now where I‚Äôm not trying to eat as much fat, but stay around 1800 calories. I‚Äôm still around 20 carbs max, probably less because my fitness pal doesn‚Äôt say net carbs. Only thing with carbs that I eat is a little whole milk in my coffee and that keto ice cream. It‚Äôs been a week and today is the first day my keto meter says I‚Äôm in a slight nutrional ketosis. I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs taking so long or what I‚Äôm doing wrong. Maybe if I‚Äôm eating in a surplus of calories that my body can‚Äôt get into ketosis? Yesterday was probably the least amount of food I had in a day all week and I had a lighter dinner than usual. And this morning is when I checked with my keto meter. I exercise every day with weights and walking. I‚Äôm 31 female 127 lbs so I don‚Äôt need to lose weight although I‚Äôd like to lose a few pounds but I‚Äôm more interested in the metal clarity and energy. Weight loss is a bonus. Last night was also the first time in weeks that I had a couple bites on fruit and sugar from a lemon cake. I‚Äôm wondering how the heck today I could have my best readings after eating sugar and actual carbs for the first time last night. ",1,1743262849.0,keto,0,1.0,False

I truly feel loved; you‚Äôre so thoughtful and warm. I love you all ‚Äî both the girls and the guys, you‚Äôre all so sweet.

Knowing that I‚Äôve been feeling down, you bought me coffee just to appreciate the effort I made to come and study with you. You shout out my name from afar because you‚Äôre excited to hang out with me. Every time we meet, you hug me and compliment me ‚Äî saying I‚Äôm pretty, that I smell good, that my style is wow.

How can we be this in sync? Even the guys are so sweet! Honestly, I can even say that Indonesian guys seem more reserved compared to you ‚Äî but you really know how to balance things and show such warmth.

In Indonesia, there‚Äôs a term ‚ÄúCindo‚Äù which means ‚ÄúChinese Indonesian‚Äù ‚Äî a nickname for Chinese people who were born in Indonesia. And honestly, I feel like I‚Äôve become a Cindo while living here hahaha.

Also, I just realized why Chinese girls (cici) often end up with Chinese guys (koko) ‚Äî now it totally makes sense to me, hahaha. And they always care about me.

By the way‚Ä¶ are Korean guys really like the ones in dramas? Hahaha just wondering!",1,1743262844.0,asian,2,0.67,False

I'll spend a couple days in Leipzig in May, and since most of my days would be spent studying I'd like to find a quiet place for this: I looked up the Leipzig library but was unsure how crowded it can get, and if I can go there without any registration (I have a student card from another EU country). Any advice? Quiet coffee places could also work for instance

Another unrelated question: I like classical music and would really enjoy a concert since Leipzig is famous for it: would you know of any ""student deals"" in this regard, or any tips to attend such concerts relatively cheaply?

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn‚Äôt appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I‚Äôm liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn‚Äôt want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I‚Äôm looking forward to taking about what you didn‚Äôt like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I‚Äôll hit u up for next time. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don‚Äôt feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction.¬†

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens.¬†

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character.¬†Non stop.

I‚Äôm not interested in ever being friends after this. I don‚Äôt deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"".

1jmovm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1jmovm6/row_on_5_london/,"ROW on 5, London (*)","ROW on 5, the latest restaurant from the Jason Atherton stable, opened in Savile Row, Mayfair last November and was awarded a Michelin star in this year's UK guide (although, as the staff make clear, they are very much aiming higher). Executive Chef Spencer Metzger won the prestigious Roux Scholarship in 2019, subsequently staging at Frantzen (the influence is clear at times), becoming Head Chef at The Ritz restaurant (round the corner from his new place).

My wife and I had lunch there yesterday - we'd started a tradition of having lunch at the Ritz on my birthday, but this year decided to follow Chef Metzger from there to his new place. We had the tasting menu, supplemented with a couple of courses - caviar and potato and wagyu and had the median priced wine pairing.

**The Restaurant**

As others have mentioned in reviews, the restaurant is divided into a basement ""lounge"" area where canapes and desserts are served and an upstairs open-kitchen/bar restaurant area where the main part of the meal is served. Having eaten at Frantzen a couple of years ago, the influence in this type of set up was very apparent, as was the informal blending of chefs/serving staff - i.e. chefs, including Chef Metzger served dishes to guests themselves.

Entering the restaurant is via stairs from street level, to a door with a bell marked ""Press for Dinner"". On reception, guests are asked if they would like their coats dry-cleaned, (as a nod to this being Savile Row, the traditional home of men's tailoring in London). We were then taken on a tour of the wine cellars that surround the basement lounge - so far, all very Frantzen.

**Canapes**

Guests are seated in the lounge and offered champagne/English sparkling wine - and a set of single-bite canapes was served. First was ""oyster and pearls"" a take on the French Laundry classic - in this case a sphere of almond sitting on an almond macaroon, pressed cucumber and a layer of N25 kaluga caviar. This was a refreshing start, although I found the flavours a little muted. Next was a tartlet of raw bluefin tuna - different cuts including otoro all garnished with a yuzu-based dressing and garnished with kombu - delicious, a fantastic mouthful! I had been looking forward to trying the next canape, a cheese and onion layered sandwich with aged Lincolnshire Poacher cheese, onion based crisp layers, a  sort of chutney and topped with a truffle jelly. This was definitely the most intensely flavoured of the canapes, a real jolt of strong umami flavours. Finally, we were served a langoustine claw coated in a very fine tempura batter, alongside a yuzu(?)-based sauce to dip and chopsticks that had been engraved with our names. Although this was a nice touch, eating the tempura with them was pretty fiddly and in the end I used my fingers! For me this was the least successful canape, with a slight greasiness overpowering the taste of the langoustine (although we got to keep the chopsticks as a gift).

**The Main Courses**

We were then ushered into a lift to the upper level and shown to our table for the main part of the meal.

The first dish was a second serving of langoustine, this time the tail served with a jelly made from amela tomato (apparently the sweetest tomato of all!). It was seasoned with smoked vinegar and calamansi. The langoustine was brushed in smoked vinegar, garnished with calamansi gel, potato crisps and shiso flowers. This was served with two sauces, one a duck egg sabayon flavoured with aji Amarillo. The other was a finger lime/curry leaf oil. This was fantastic, the two sauces working really well together.

Next was an orkney scallop topped with XO sauce partly made with the scallop skirts, served in a beurre blanc made with sake and covered in salmon roe that had also been soaked in sake. I'm a big fan of scallops and so was looking forward to this one, but was a little disappointed that, for me, the scallop was overpowered by the taste of the salmon roe. The beurre blanc, however, was beautiful - I would have happily had a bowl of that and some bread to mop it up!

This was followed by an additional course of N25 Kaluga caviar served on a potato puree - the puree very reminiscent to me of the Robuchon classic version, all silky and buttery and the caviar was a fantastic way of seasoning this. A very luxurious and comforting dish, which was paired with a glass of Henriot rose champagne.

A bread course followed, which was a laminated brioche (again, very Frantzen), paired with butter that was topped with roasted chicken skin. This was fine, although our server promised us ""the best bread you have ever tasted"" which is a big claim to make! I personally am not a huge fan of brioche and would have preferred a sourdough, or focaccia maybe, but this is just personal taste. I also would have preferred the bread course as more traditionally earlier in the meal - it would have been nice to mop up the beurre blanc with it!

Next was the dish of the day by far - Cornish turbot, served with new season snowdrop peas and a sauce whose details I unfortunately can't remember, except to say that this was one of the best sauces I have ever tested, and definitely the best turbot dish I have eaten. I wish I had taken notes of what was in the sauce! The dish had only been put on the menu the night before so was brand new, but in my view they should keep it on as long as possible. Interestingly, we were served this by Chef Metzger himself, who seemed really intrigued as to whether we liked it, given that this was its debut - in our view he has a real winner of a dish with this one!

The main course was Sika deer or as a supplement, wagyu. We had one of each and shared them - I thought of the two, the venison was the winner, with stronger depth of flavour, although my wife preferred the beef. Unfortunately at this point, we forgot to take a photo before starting to eat, so the accompanying photos are a bit messy! Whilst they were both fine dishes, they suffered from following the turbot - we were still marvelling at that dish and so probably didn't appreciate the mains.

A cheese course (in name only) was a canape-sized delicate tart containing a filling based on Cashel blue cheese, a mild Irish blue cheese. I think that this had replaced a previous version that used Colston Basset Stilton cheese in the filling and for me was a bit disappointing - I would have liked to try the more robust Stilton version.

**Desserts**

We then moved onto pre-dessert, in this case Alfonso mango in the form of sorbet, fruit and something else that I can't remember! It was delicious and refreshing though - a perfect pre-dessert. I think at this point guests were taken back downstairs for the rest of the meal. We were limited to 3 hours and so had the dessert served in the main restaurant to save time.

The main dessert was a Mayan Red chocolate sphere and mousse. Miso caramel used white miso, grue briselet, salted hazelnut and artichoke ice cream, coffee and Baileys sabayon, with caramel fudge at the bottom. This was rich and decadent - a chocolate-lovers dream.

At this point we did return to the lounge for ""tea and cake"" - madeleines made from Okinawa sugar and hazelnut, along with two creams to dip them in - one, a milk oolong tea cream and a second Earl Grey tea cream. These were lovely, both creams being a nice complement for the madeleines. Unfortunately we ate these before remembering to take a photo! As though this wasn't enough sugar, we were served a small  71% Oswaldo chocolate tart, smoked olive oil, sea salt and a tempered disk of chocolate allowed to melt over the top. Again, unfortunately no photo. At this point, we had met our match and so had our petit fours boxed up - these were a mixture of pate de fruits, chocolates and caramels, a fudge and miniature citrus tart. All tasted great the next day!

**Wine Pairing**

We opted for the mid-level wine pairing (¬£220 per person) - there were several, including one at ¬£995 that featured wines such as Petrus and d'Yquem. Again, unfortunately I didn't make notes or take photos, but there were some top level producers in our pairing, e.g. Egon Muller Scharzhofberger, Kracher and Harlan Estate ""The Mascot"". Pourings were definitely on the small side, though, so we finished off with an espresso martini (her) and an armagnac (me) from the large drinks trolley in the lounge.

**Service**

Service was fantastic throughout. I am a big fan of chefs serving dishes and really conveying their enthusiasm for their food - it was great to see Chef Metzger serving many of the courses too. With both the numbers of staff, along with the high degree of enthusiasm and knowledge that everyone at ROW on 5 exudes, it's clear that they are aiming for two stars, if not three. What I hadn't seen mentioned in any reviews was the quite loud music playing throughout - a very 1980's / early '90's playlist, apparently put together by Jason Atherton. It was all a bit VH1 for my tastes, but wasn't too intrusive.

**Overall**

This was a meal with some real highlights, not least of which is the new turbot dish and an overall high level throughout, with no real duds. It all costs of course - a small matter of just under ¬£750 per person, with the mid-level wine pairing, so this is firmly up there price-wise with all of the three star places in the UK. We certainly preferred it to fairly recent visits to Core or Helene Darroze. It was interesting, given the recent media furore around Jason Atherton and sexism in the hospitality industry, that he wasn't present and the focus was very much on Chef Metzger and his team - a team that includes a significant proportion of female chefs front and centre.

Overall, an excellent lunch - we will definitely return!

1jmov0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jmov0q/am_i_the_problem/,Am I the problem?,"Hey guys, just looking for some advice on some things that have happened because I'm always made to feel like the issue or the problem. 

I am currently in a relationship that's been going on for about two years maybe a little over. My bond with my partner's mother isn't the best. I've tried to better the bond but she seems stuck in her ways. Well she is stuck in her ways, as my partner says. Here's the run down.

I started babysitting for his mother immediately , as she has four little kids and both her and their father works so nobody was able to watch them. (Don't know what she did when I wasn't in the picture) my partner had told me not to babysit for her because she was gonna take advantage of it. I thought he was just being bias, but I wasn't getting paid correctly sometimes I wasn't getting paid at all. I was watching them for a long hours. The kids didn't obey or listen to me they were becoming disrespectful and when I voiced that to the mother she got mad. One time when I was supposed to babysit in the morning my partner had put hands on me. I immediately knew I had a concussion, I went upstairs told his mother and she came down to yell at him but was only concerned about how I was gonna treat the younger siblings.... then she went off to work in an hour later I had sent her a text saying I had to go to the hospital because I was an extreme pain. Went to the hospital was diagnosed with a concussion came back and was still asked to babysit continuously while I was supposed to be recovering. Fast-forward a couple months later when I was babysitting the kids had become too much for me, I've never dealt with kids who don't listen and disrespect authority. She had sent me a text asking if I could babysit all week and weekend... I had told my partner I didn't wanna do that because it was too much for me. She had ended up kicking us out of her house. Well she kicked us out we were homeless living out of my partner's car. She was blowing up both of our phones mostly his, trying to get in contact with us to say she's sorry and she feels bad and she wants him to come back. Sending him text messages about his childhood and how she's his mother and he can't just ignore her and all this crap. Then started sending messages on how he's putting me above her and she would take a bullet for him and I wouldn't do the same thing for him that she would basically saying that she's better than me and her love is better and stronger than my love for him. Not only was she talking bad on my name his entire family was because she went out and told them that we weren't living there anymore and wasn't speaking to her but I don't think she told them she was the reason why we weren't living there or speaking to her. fast-forward a couple months after that we ended up coming back to the house, because we were told things would be better. But it's not his mother is very dismissive towards my feelings and my mental health and physical health. I try to bring up how I feel when she does certain things that is disrespectful towards me and I'm told to forget about it or I'm told that it's not that big of a deal. I've told her multiple times about her son laying hands on me and she showed no concern. Well we were kicked out of the house and homeless she had tried to link up with his ex ( same ex he fucked behind my back & I cried in her arms over ) to go out for some coffee. Sent me the same text a couple days later. I didn't find out about it until recently and I had said something to my partner about it. He said something to his mother and she apologized to him that same night. Nothing was said to me, fast-forward a couple weeks till Christmas, I still hadn't had an apology and I was expected to go upstairs and celebrate with the family. I had told my partner how I didn't feel comfortable going up there, and I was still highly upset that I hadn't even been given an apology. He ended up laying hands on me again because he was making excuses for his mother and I got upset and raised my voice a little bit because I felt unheard. Then he goes upstairs to celebrate while I stay downstairs and she had sent me an apology. I knew something didn't feel right but I was giving the benefit of the doubt because that is his mother. Well he told me a couple days ago she only apologized because he said something to her on Christmas. So the apology was fake. A week ago she was asking about my physical therapy appointment and I had expressed how I have an injury due to an abusive situation. She asked if her son had laid hands on me again and I told her about what happened on Christmas and why. She showed no concern for what happened to me.. ( had my head bashed into a wall ) I tried expressing how I felt over the situation with his ex (as that's why I was hit ) and her inviting her out for coffee. And she told me that it's really not that big of a deal she didn't see it as an issue and I should just get over it.  ( she's a married woman in a committed relationship, with four kids by this man... she knew it was an issue to text her sons ex that she knew he fucked while he was with me. When she had asked him and I were already engaged ). My partner likes to make jokes about other females and I've brought that up to his mother on how it makes me feel insecure and she tells me to just let him be him and do what he wants. She's told me to cook clean and kiss his ass and maybe the abuse will stop...

Personally I find her behavior is very disrespectful because if they were happening to her she would be upset as well. I try over and over again to be nice to be civil to help out when I can, just to be dismissed or disregarded or disrespected. My partner says there's no talking to her about feelings because he can't even do it. That she doesn't understand she doesn't have boundaries or respect and she feels as if she's on a higher level than me or anyone because of what she's gone through as a child till now. Which I also find bullshit because I don't think anybody's higher than anybody else we all go through struggles we all are human. humans trying to survive at the end of the day. We all have feelings and all want to feel cared for and loved and respected. And I personally believe that as a 49 almost 50-year-old woman you should understand on how to treat other people. Especially another woman who is getting abused by your son. 


Now I already know you guys are gonna say to leave the relationship ... I'm aware I need to I just need to get things lined up before I leave, as I don't have much going for myself right now other then a car. I'm in the works of getting a job and then the works of setting up shelter with a DV program. I know what I need to leave the relationship and in a way I'm in denial because I do hold love for this man. But I also am aware that how I'm being treated by both him and his mother is extremely wrong and I can't continue living like that. It's unhealthy to me. 
Ps. She also gets jealous when he takes me out on dates takes me to get drink drinks or takes me for massages... it low-key makes me feel like she wants an intimate relationship with her son. ",2,1743262351.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

In honor of the season, I‚Äôm focusing on springtime and floral fragrances in this review ‚Äì things that remind me of tender new leaves and bright colors. Early in my perfume journey, I tended to avoid straight florals, somehow thinking them too boring and traditionally feminine, but Cirrus Parfum has helped me see their potential to be evocative and marvelous in their own right.

**Preferences:** I love refreshing, joyful, and clean scents, as well as creamy botanicals and chic atmospherics. Favorite notes include aromatics (lavender, rosemary, peppermint), spices (cardamom, clove, etc.), teas, citrus, pear, tropical fruits, figs, cedar, juniper, frankincense, and fruity florals. I don‚Äôt like dark scents, animalics, or cloying gourmands, and I avoid notes of rose, orange blossom, cherry, carmel, leather, saffron, tobacco, and heavy incense.¬†

**Ratings**: A score of 1 means instant loathing, while 10 is reserved for my all-time favorite smells (very few things get a 10). As always, these reflect my own sensory peculiarities, and your mileage may vary. My reviews get a little rambly at times, so buckle in!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bellano

*Star jasmine, orange flower absolute, lavender, ambergris, clear lake water, ozone, chocolate, and a hint of coffee*¬†

There's something decidedly Italian about this fragrance: full sun, narrow streets, flowers vines twining along a railing, a waft of espresso. I was lucky enough to travel to Italy for a friend‚Äôs wedding, where, one morning, all of us tumbled into cars and took a day trip to Lake Garda, encircled by mountains and sunset-colored houses. We sipped aperitifs on the banks of the lake, took turns plunging into the frigid water, and wandered the streets with gelato melting over our fingers.

This perfume, too, smells carefree and excessive. Immediately after applying, I smell fragrant white florals and, in the background, the subtle play of a water accord, crystal clear and cool. The ozone is quite light; I find ozonic materials occasionally trigger headaches for me, but here they just contribute to a fresh lakeside atmosphere. I don‚Äôt experience the chocolate as especially gourmand -- rather, there‚Äôs a bittersweet, rich cocoa haze that emerges after a few minutes, acting as a counterpoint to the flowers. It‚Äôs a fairly linear fragrance, one that takes about 15 minutes to fully unfold, but then holds the main notes until the end several hours later.

Bellano has an unexpected combination of notes, a voyager atmospheric that captures the spirit of Italy in summer. For me, personally, it never settles into something I‚Äôd reach for ‚Äì I‚Äôm not a fan of orange blossoms, and the contrast between the sweet flowers and bitter chocolate proves to be a bit too intense for my nose. But that‚Äôs completely a matter of taste; I can see how, for others, this could be a refined and unique favorite.¬†

***A note on format:*** I tried both the oil and the EDP, and found that the oil is much more floral-forward on me. The EDP has better balance between the flowers and the chocolate, and the chocolate smells slightly sweeter (in a good way) than the oil.

Rating: 5/10 ‚Äì *mostly due to my irrational distaste for orange blossom*

# Betrothed

*White tea roses, transparent bone musk, white lilies, white oudh, a trace of vanillin and black peppercorn*

Roses and I have a complicated relationship. My grandmother decorated her whole house in pink and green, and had those tiny carved rose soaps in the bathroom which, inexplicably, we were never allowed to touch. My childhood neighbors had primroses in their garden, and I remember breathing in their fragrance while getting scolded not to pick them. (I loved pulling apart plants when I was a kid to see how they were constructed ‚Äì so, kinda fair.)

All that to say: roses and rule-following are bound up together for me, and I‚Äôve never felt entirely easy around it as a note. But I‚Äôve liked so many of Cirrus‚Äô florals that I couldn‚Äôt help myself, and I picked up an EDP sample of Betrothed in the swaps. And wow, I‚Äôm so glad I did. I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm suddenly converted to a rose lover, but this scent is vibrant and alive. I looked up a tea rose, and it‚Äôs the classic sort that grows in formal gardens, with plush petals and elaborate formations, so tightly wound you can‚Äôt see the stamens at the center. Even though Zoey says this rose is white, [my mental image](https://www.jacksonandperkins.com/images/xxl/28577.webp?v=0-1) features rose petals tipped in pink, graduating to peach and yellow towards the stem. I find the overall effect to be green and spicy, youthful without being juvenile. It‚Äôs rose with a backbone ‚Äì a little feral, outspoken, and wild.

I honestly don‚Äôt pick up the other notes distinctly, although I can get an occasional whiff of something woody (must be the white oudh) and there‚Äôs a mild, barely-there trace of vanilla on the drydown. Altogether, it‚Äôs quite lovely. I‚Äôm still not sure it‚Äôs me, but this is the rare rose that inspires me to give it a second wear.

Rating: 7/10¬†

# Daphnedil

*Night blooming daphne, daffodil, rose geranium, ylang ylang, plumeria, and a heavy dose of orcanox (ambergris material)*

The opening is a whiff of yellow daffodils. One sniff, and I‚Äôm transported back to a memory as a seven-year-old, picking daffodils with my mom and wrapping them carefully in damp paper towels and tinfoil to give away to neighbors. That nostalgic smell is delicate and fleeting, fading only after a minute or two, swiftly giving way to more tropical florals. I also detect a brighter, more lemony flower ‚Äì I think that‚Äôs the daphne, keeping this fragrance airy and cheerful. I don‚Äôt personally get much of the rose geranium, which could be due to my nose or the fact I tested an oil formulation, as those delicate spicy notes are often better preserved in EDPs.¬†It‚Äôs perfect for early spring days ‚Äî romantic and happy, like I‚Äôm picnicking in a garden, half-nodding off in the sun.

Yellow florals always remind me of apricots, for some reason; there‚Äôs something fruity, warm, and a bit earthy about them. I had the same experience with Byredo‚Äôs Bal D‚ÄôAfrique, another yellow floral, although I find Daphnedil to be much lighter and more playful (and more to my taste). The silage is fainter on me than some of Cirrus‚Äô other scents, turning into a skin scent after about 3 hours, but that‚Äôs really my only complaint; I‚Äôm excited to wear this in the spring and into the summer.

Rating: 8/10

# Enforced Modesty

*Fig leaf, ripening figs, laurel wreaths, purple lilac, green mandarin, ivy, marble stone, and creeping thyme*

Enforced Modesty is a creamy, pastel wash of a perfume, all pale green and soft purples. It opens with bruised leaves and lilacs, and then settles into a fresh, lightly floral (almost soapy), and creamy scent. The figs are green and barely ripe, lending just a touch of sweetness without being syrupy or sticky. There‚Äôs a decidedly cool quality to this scent, evoking the sensation of shade. The lilacs are most present in the first part of the drydown, eventually giving way to the final stage of the scent (and my absolute favorite part). After a few hours, the perfume fades into this luminous aroma that‚Äôs velvety, herbal, and ever-so-slightly sweet. I mostly pick up the thyme, but there's a hint of laurel bay leaf thrown in for good measure, spicy and aromatic. 

I feel like a poised, ethereal version of myself in this scent ‚Äì clean, elegant, harmonious, and a little dreamy. It's easy to wear for lots of occasions, suitable for the office as well as dinner with friends. 

***A note on format:*** I tried both the oil and the EDP for this scent. On me, the oil version amplified the lilac notes, so the first couple of hours were quite powdery and sudsy (to the point that I kept on tasting soap whenever I took a bite of my lunch ‚Äì very weird experience to eat my perfume). I find the EDP to be a better match for my preferences, as it maintains a creamy-green-herbal vibe with just a suggestion of lilac in the background. Perfection!

# Fall Creek

*Ice water, grand fir tips, jammy fir absolute, mossy river rocks, and a faint trail of some unknown wildflowers*

Fall Creek is a subalpine scene in spring ‚Äì a fast-moving glacial stream, water slicking stones, green moss capping roots and rocks on either side, small white and yellow wildflowers growing in the shade. I was expecting a forest atmospheric, but it leans towards fresh aquatic on me. It‚Äôs a trail by a waterfall, the clear mist making everything cool, sweet, and new.

The opening is earthy moss, abstract florals, bracing peppermint. The aquatic accord has a slightly mineral quality, giving the impression of dirt or rocks. As someone who‚Äôs sampled a lot of Pineward and enjoys a good tree perfume, it took me a moment to tune into the fir note here. The fir in Fall Creek is subtle and camphorous, not the resinous scent of broken needles or sticky sap. It blends into the other notes and acts like a bass line, creating a foundation for the scent that‚Äôs supportive instead of dominant. 

It took me a few wears before I figured this one out, but it's really grown on me over time. To my nose, it‚Äôs a pretty and expressive atmospheric that smells like mountain air. The vibe is closer to a painting than a photograph, capturing the essence of a scene but stopping just short of perfect reproduction, which honestly makes it wearable in more settings. It‚Äôs light and fresh, perfect for spring, though I think it‚Äôd work year-round.¬†

***A note on format:*** The oil and EDP are pretty similar to one another, nearly indistinguishable. I noticed the florals and moss more in the oil, whereas the peppermint and fir were a tiny bit more pronounced in the EDP format. For those who are sensitive to migraines, I‚Äôd recommend sampling this first; I feel a little pressure behind my eyes if I sniff it directly on my skin, although it never veers into headache territory for me personally.

# Sybarite

*Red champaca absolute, red mandarin, a deeply sexy vanilla, red musk, and a blend of natural sandalwoods*

This scent is a joyful, fruity, sensual floral. It opens with a bright citrus note, and then blooms into a sultry, tropical flower. I‚Äôve never smelled champaca before, but to me it smells a bit like jasmine ‚Äì but fruitier, as if its center has been adorned with a tart red berry. At moments, I pick up hints of tannins, delicately tea-like and astringent, floating around the petals. The vanilla is barely there, adding just a touch of sweetness, and the sandalwood is a sheer presence underneath, offering a slightly spicy woodiness that brings the whole thing together. The heart of the perfume (in oil format) lasts around 4 hours on me, and then evaporates to a musky final drydown with faint echoes of the flowers.

Sybarite is lush, bold, and enchanting. Something about this fragrance makes me think of a party: it‚Äôs a person in an eye-catching red dress or a bold graphic button-down, turning heads but not demanding to be the center of attention. I find myself reaching for it in the evening when I need a boost of confidence before a gathering or a date, and suddenly feel like the most magnetic person in the room.

***Mini bonus review:*** I also tried **Landscape Fan-Fic**, another freshie from Cirrus (*Notes: wet, herbal mint leaves, oakmoss, clary sage, flowering clover, and new mulch)*. I know a lot of folks like this one, but it‚Äôs decidedly not for me. It‚Äôs green, aquatic, and grassy -- but as I put in my notes, I couldn‚Äôt shake the scent association: ‚ÄúWatery mint, has a dad vibe.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt do it. Had to scrub it.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

To sum it up: I‚Äôm a fan of Cirrus Parfum‚Äôs style and found a lot of scents I enjoy! Most of Cirrus' scents are modern, delicate, and precise. Whereas some brands specialize in realistic atmospherics or transporting ambers, I‚Äôd say that Zoey is a master of mood and has a deft hand when it comes to botanicals in particular.

They say ""Money Can't buy Happiness"", but what it can buy is new experiences, and in my book, a lot of happiness can come from new experiences. I'm sure I'll get pushback that you can get ""new experiences"" without spending money, but at the end of the day, you're usually travelling somewhere to get said experience. Travelling is either gas money, plane tickets, etc. If you're going someplace overnight, you need a hotel, or you have to sleep in your car. Other ways of getting new experiences could be signing up for some type of class, like line-dancing, pottery lessons, stuff like that, but again, normally money has to come out of that pocket.

If you're struggling like me, you can't allow any money to come out of that pocket, because you have a very strict budget that you can't deviate from. You have to stick to the script. Unrelentingly. 

So, typically my biggest burst of pleasure in a single day is some food item that I'm eating. Normally something that's not considered healthy in the slightest.

A prime example for me is my breakfast on Monday's. I always get a Blueberry Muffin from the local Safeway. It costs $1.49. I'm sometimes able to get them for a buck each in a 4-pack during a sale. (They freeze well, if you wrap some siran wrap around em, and then put them in a Ziploc heavy-duty freezer bag). I always make sure to buy them on the day they were baked. If they were baked yesterday, or the day before, fuhgeddaboudit.

I put the muffin my microwave for about 27 seconds. Then split it in half and put a bit of butter on each side. I enjoy it with my morning cup of coffee.

It's absolute bliss. Especially the first couple of bites. Definitely the biggest spike of dopamine I get for the whole day by a country mile. I know this is pretty sad and pathetic, but I'm just being honest. I'm single (divorced), living by myself. I don't get a ton of comradery and companionship in my normal life. I have some good friends, but don't see them that frequently. I have some family members I love, but they don't live too close and the cost of gas is nuts.

I'm not trying to say ""Oh woe is me!"" with this post. I'm just saying how things are, and wondering if other peeps are in my same situation.

Another thing I find that gives me a burst of joy/happiness is watching clips of standup comedy on YouTube. Louis C.K. is my favorite comedian. An absolute genius imo",20,1743261963.0,povertyfinance,8,0.88,False

Matchup:
Coachella Valley Firebirds (33-22-2-5)
vs.
Chicago Wolves (32-27-3-0)
@ Allstate Arena | 7PM CT (5:00 PM PDT)
Watch on AHLTV or listen in with your beverage of choice.


Apologies for the delay‚Äîsomewhere between time zones, line changes, and maybe too much coffee, we almost forgot to post today‚Äôs thread. But don‚Äôt worry, the Firebirds didn‚Äôt forget their sticks. Let‚Äôs get into it.

---

Last Time Out:
Coachella is coming off their first win in five games, and we‚Äôre clinging to it like it‚Äôs the last open chair at a desert pool. The offense finally clicked again, and we‚Äôre hoping that momentum made it onto the plane to Chicago.

Keys to Victory Tonight:

Early Pressure: The Firebirds need to bottle that third-period fire they showed recently and uncork it in the first.

Special Teams Execution: Our PK unit is still top-5 in the league. Keep it tight, and maybe sneak in a shorty for fun.

Get Weird in Front of the Net: Tips, rebounds, pinball chaos. With several top scorers still out, it‚Äôs time for some lunch-pail, greasy goals.

---

Players to Watch ‚Äì Firebirds:

Ben Meyers is still leading the way with 21 goals and 42 points.

Logan Morrison (37 pts) continues to be the unsung hero of this roster.

Ty Nelson is quietly +16 and making a strong defensive impact with 27 points.


Players to Watch ‚Äì Wolves:

Bradly Nadeau leads Chicago with 27 goals and is the AHL‚Äôs top rookie goal scorer.

Justin Robidas isn‚Äôt far behind with 46 points‚Äîsneaky fast and loves the slot.

Spencer Martin in net is holding a .911 SV%, and likely starting tonight.



---

Fun Fact Corner:

This is the Firebirds‚Äô first trip to Allstate Arena this season.

The Firebirds are 8-2-0 when scoring first on the road.

Logan Morrison and Luke Henman are somehow tied for ""most underrated celebration fist pump."" Totally unofficial, but we stand by it.

The Firebirds‚Äô penalty kill sits at 85.5%, 4th-best in the entire league.

1jmol1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jmol1v/last_bad_night_with_alcohol_never_drinking_again/,"Last bad night with alcohol, never drinking again.","I didn't start drinking until I turned 23. Before then, the taste was absolutely *repulsive,* and I didn't understand how people did it. I had tried mixed drinks, different things, all of it was gross. I would have an absolute sugar bomb of a drink with a low abv, and that was about all I could handle. I rarely drank those though because they were expensive, and they didn't... do anything. 

I don't know what happened after 23, what would've normally made me gag wasn't so bad. Like, did it taste great? No. But I realized it was pretty worth it considering how it made me feel afterwards. I was a major lightweight, barely ever drank, and so I started trying new things. I got into canned mix drinks with a higher abv and some weren't so bad. My husband got me hooked on vodka and orange juice, which became my favorite thing. And it was cheaper than buying the pre-mixed drinks. 

I overdid it on Thanksgiving and I thought I learned my lesson. That night, I went to his family's Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone in his family drinks. Me doing the same thing was no big deal. However, I hadn't done it in a while and hadn't eaten much during the day, and then I decided to have two of the canned drinks. Major mistake. I make it home, he drove and was sober, and after being home for half an hour, I realized I really, really over did it. I couldn't even enjoy how I was feeling, I was nauseous, the room was spinning, I couldn't even read my phone. I fell asleep and woke up to me throwing up on myself. How nice. 

Time goes on, I take it easy for a while and decide I should probably give it a break. Clearly, I don't know what I'm doing. Then I start back up. I get into the vodka and orange juice, and I think I know how to drink without overdoing it. Just enough to feel nice, not enough to get queasy. 

I went from only drinking on weekends, to once during the week and weekends, to a couple days a week and the weekends, until it just happened any day I wanted to. I'd wait until an ""appropriate"" time to drink, and I'd do it just about every day. Or until I ran out of orange juice. If I was desperate enough, I'd get creative and find something else to mix it with. I still couldn't handle drinking it straight. 

I always measured how much alcohol went into the drink, but not the orange juice. I always went off how it tasted. This last time, I don't know what I did wrong. I don't know if I lost count, if I didn't put enough orange juice, if I drank it too fast, if I didn't eat enough beforehand. It hit me, all of the sudden. I'm hot in the face, I'm making too much saliva, the room is spinning and again, and I can't fucking read. Words on my TV look like hieroglyphics. 

I go to the bathroom and take a shower. I figured, I got sick that other time and felt better. I'll just make it happen. I did it, again, and again, and again. I did not feel better. Boom, upset stomach. I'm back and forth between on the toilet to hugging the toilet. 

I had never fallen asleep hugging a toilet before, but I did that night. I woke up an hour later, not feeling much better, but at least not feeling nauseous. 

He revealed to me the next day that the milk had gone bad. The milk I had used to make coffee. the day I overdid it and felt miserable. The milk that wasn't even out of date yet. I checked it when he said that and sure enough, it was bad milk. I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but it was beyond an upset stomach from the milk. I was way more drunk than normal, but I'm sure the milk didn't help. 

TL;DR, I'm never drinking again. I had a miserable night. I now know what it's like to fall asleep with my face on a toilet. And I hate milk. ",2,1743261586.0,Vent,1,0.75,False

*Eating a package of Speculoos Spiced Crispy cookies (by ChocZero) and a Truth dark chocolate coconut bar each day have helped me be as regular as I have ever been in my life*

  
**LONG**  
Sometimes the best discoveries occur when trying to explore something entirely different. I have for a long time suspected that gluten slows me down tremendously, gives me brain fog, and is a primary cause of my constipation. As such, I ventured onto a gluten-free diet (to be fair, a very low gluten diet).

While my primary meals were not difficult to change, I did have a tough time with my morning and afternoon snacks. I am a bit particular with calorie and macro counting as well as timing of my meals throughout the day. I am also a coffee drinker (no more than 2.5 cups per day) but I simply love having a small cookie or equivalent with my coffee. All the snacks I love appear to be chock full of gluten, so really the only difficult adjustment for me was to find a gluten-free snack(s).

I got very very lucky on my first try. I adore Biscoff cookies so I quickly searched for gluten-free cookies that resembled the taste of Biscoff and the first match I found was Speculoos Spiced Crispy cookies (by ChocZero). When I looked closely at the nutritional facts, I was floored to find out each 120 cal packet has 8 grams of fiber! And of course, gluten-free. So to Amazon I went. Can't say enough good things about this product, it is extremely low in sugar as well.

I really was not in the market for anything else until recently I had to prepare for a business trip that entailed a long drive. Walking down the aisle of one of my local grocery stores I stumbled upon an interesting 'power bar' of sorts (although, there is very little protein)...it is marketed for prebiotics and probiotics, of which I am a huge fan of. I just happen to love coconut flavored anything, so I grabbed a package of Truth Dark Chocolate Coconut bars. And wouldn't you know it....each bar is 180 calories (a tad high) but WOW 9 grams of fiber! And of course gluten-free! So get this...I almost instantly added 17 grams of fiber to my already fairly decent high/medium fiber diet. 

Now ... I can hear some eyes rolling from here LOL. Sure, any time you bump your fiber content by 50% or more, sure, it's going to lead to better bowel movements. But .... I think it's more of some stars aligning for me. I think, yes, it's the additional fiber...but it is also the fact that both snacks are gluten-free (previously, my snacking was my biggest contributor of gluten in my diet), but I also want to add, I do believe it is the fat content of the Truth bar (from what I gather the bar's fat is  Cocoa Butter) that turbo-charges my system as well.

Could it all really be simply the introduction of a greatly improved gluten-free (or extremely low gluten) diet? Yes. But I also can't help that these products take me much, much further to where I want to be with my BMs. Like I said in the first paragraph, I have never been this regular my entire life.

The only crappy thing (pun intended) is that the Truth bars are filthy expensive. I am constantly scouring the internet for deals and coupons for these LOL. Small price to pay for happiness, however. Good luck to you all.",2,1743261505.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

I keep seeing various sources stating that there is a difference between break and rest. Break is a period where you must be able to rest and recouperate, so can be taken in a RDC with seats and a coffee machine, whereas rest is a period where you should be able to freely dispose of your time. So you can walk away, go and get something to eat, maybe even go on a very short city break to Budapest, as long as you're ready to start work 11 hours later (or 9 hours, whatever.)

People seem so certain about this but I haven't been able to find any legislation or official guidance on the subject. Admittedly my Google powers aren't great but I have spent a few hours going down this rabbit hole to no avail.

My main goal is in connection with split rests. If that first 3 hours is spent at an RDC, even if asleep in the cab, you still aren't able to freely dispose of your time. Does that still count as rest? Or maybe it's only the 9 hour element that matters?

If I am still, they are barely noticeable, but the moment I stand up or exert myself, they start throbbing. They aren't head splittingly painful, but I would say they are about a 5 or 6 out of 10 on the pain scale. I've had headaches in the past that would get worse when moving, but those always go away in a day or less. I've never in my life had a headache persist through the night, so this is slightly alarming to me. 

  
I drink coffee every morning, and on the day the headaches started, I did not have a cup, so I initially thought it could be caffeine withdrawal. However, the next day and today they have persisted even with my usual coffee. Other than that, the only other thing I can possibly recall that could contribute is that I have been sneezing, sniffling, coughing, and itchy throat a lot the week leading up to the headaches because of allergies. However, these symptoms subsided about 2 days before the headaches started, so I am increasingly becoming anxious about the sudden onset and persistence of these headaches. 

  
Dr. Google has me worried that I might have a CSF leak. The pain is primarily in the upper part of my forehead and maybe a little on top of my head (essentially around my hairline area). But I read that CSF headaches primarily affect the lower back of the skull, which I have no pain there at all. There has been a slight improvement since the first day (which had the worst symptoms), but it seems like it has plateaued a little bit. Today is, I think, the fourth day since onset and it seems like the headaches aren't improving anymore, but they aren't getting worse either. 



I don't really have any other symptoms than the headaches (even the allergy symptoms are gone). The only medication I take is Vyvanse 70 mg once in the morning, but I have been taking it at this dose for several years, so I don't think that has anything to do with it.

## Why a Philips Universal Remote?

Before diving into the specifics of programming and troubleshooting, let's briefly touch on why people choose a Philips universal remote in the first place. For many, it's about simplifying their home entertainment setup. Instead of juggling multiple remotes ‚Äì one for the TV, another for the Blu-ray player, and yet another for the soundbar ‚Äì a Philips universal remote consolidates control into a single, convenient device. This can be a game-changer, especially when you have a complex home theater system or simply want to declutter your coffee table. selecting the best philips universal remote thus involves considering factors such as compatibility, ease of use, and features.[[Explore Top Rated philips universal remote manual on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/waterpik/?kw=philips universal remote manual)
## Finding Your Philips Universal Remote Model Number and Why It matters

The first step in getting your Philips universal remote working correctly is identifying the Philips universal remote model number. This number is crucial because it unlocks access to the specific codes and instructions tailored to your remote. You can usually find the model number on the remote itself ‚Äì often on the back, inside the battery compartment, or on the packaging.

Why is the model number so important? Philips,like othre manufacturers,produces various universal remote models,each with its own unique code set and programming methods. Using the wrong codes can lead to frustration and prevent your remote from controlling your devices properly.

I‚Äôm a new employee, and we actually met at a reception, hit it off, and then I started working at the same office the next week.

It‚Äôs not just physical‚Äîwe‚Äôre friends, we work together, we have deep, intense, intellectual conversations, and we genuinely enjoy each other‚Äôs company. But despite having feelings for each other, we both agreed this isn‚Äôt going to turn into a real relationship. There are different reasons but here a few: we work together, and while he‚Äôs not my direct boss, he‚Äôs senior to me, and can assign me work, I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs what I ultimately want and vice versa, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm what he ultimately wants. 

Recently, I felt like the lines between emotional and physical intimacy were getting blurred, so I told him we needed to set boundaries. I didn‚Äôt want to misinterpret his affection as him secretly wanting to be with me when I know that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening. This is especially because of how we act with each other‚Äîlike when I took care of him when he had the flu, or when he started showing me memes about situationships turning into real relationships. When people ask if we‚Äôre seeing someone, we both say, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm kinda dating someone right now.‚Äù We‚Äôve told each other really personal stories, he flirts with me at work happy hours in front of our coworkers (as bad as drinking my drink without asking), and he‚Äôs even hugged me at after-work events in front of people we work with.

I also told him I wouldn‚Äôt keep seeing him if he started dating someone else, and he agreed he would tell me.

He told me he‚Äôs comfortable with what we have, and I called that out‚Äîof course he is, we‚Äôre getting all the benefits of a relationship without committing. He laughed and didn‚Äôt deny it. He also said he‚Äôd think about what boundaries we should have.

When I first brought this up, I was actually just pretending I was going to leave after we hooked up, and he immediately reacted, grabbed me super fast, and begged me not to go. When we started talking, he thought I was about to fully end things and said, ‚ÄúBut this situation isn‚Äôt what you want‚Ä¶ just don‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been lying to you.‚Äù And I was like, no, I‚Äôm not done with this, you didn‚Äôt lie, we agreed to this, but it‚Äôs complicated. You say you care about me and that this isn‚Äôt meaningless, but if this has no end date (it‚Äôs been going on for two months now), then what am I supposed to do?

I told him, ‚ÄúI want to still like you and think highly of you when this ends. You‚Äôre my friend, and I don‚Äôt want to work with you and hate you.‚Äù

I feel like I‚Äôm in over my head. This is only my second real relationship (I was engaged at 20), and it‚Äôs only my third time being with a man physically. Meanwhile, he‚Äôs been married before, has dated multiple women, and has way more experience than I do. So while things might feel special or new to me, they‚Äôre not necessarily new or unique to him. But I also don‚Äôt always know what‚Äôs normal in situations like this. I grew up a little sheltered and didn‚Äôt start dating until college, when I met my ex-fianc√© (27M), and we were together for three years.

That being said, he does care about me. At work, he goes out of his way to talk to me, sneak glances, brush against me, or hug me when no one‚Äôs looking. He gives me advice, consoles me when I cry, and even insisted we celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day together. If I‚Äôm stuck at my desk, he‚Äôll randomly bring me snacks or coffee if I need it. However, I‚Äôve also noticed that if I initiate, he backs away, whereas if I‚Äôm distant, he tries really hard to get close to me.

Another thing‚ÄîI have a feeling he doesn‚Äôt want me to take another job I was offered at a different agency. Sometimes I think his advice is genuine (because I might get pigeonholed there), but other times I wonder if he just doesn‚Äôt want me to leave because this situation is nice for him, or maybe  he‚Äôs secretly competing with me. 

After we had the talk at like 2 am, everything was fine. There wasn‚Äôt any weird awkwardness. I woke up early to leave for work and when I saw him there later that morning he was still super affectionate with me.

I guess I‚Äôm just struggling to process this. Can you guys give me tips for setting boundaries with this type of relationship?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The holiday season is a time filled with joy, family, and tradition. One beloved tradition in Puerto Rican culture is the making of coquito, a rich and creamy coconut drink often dubbed ""Puerto Rican eggnog."" This festive beverage typically contains dairy, but there is a growing interest in adopting a vegan approach to this holiday staple. A Vegan Coquito recipe not only caters to those who avoid dairy but also allows everyone to enjoy a delicious, tropical flavor that embodies the spirit of the season.

The beauty of a Vegan Coquito lies in its simplicity and accessibility. By using coconut milk, coconut cream, and a variety of flavorful spices, you can create a drink that is just as indulgent as its traditional counterpart. This appealing twist ensures that anyone, regardless of dietary restrictions, can partake in the holiday celebrations.

Here‚Äôs a easy Vegan Coquito recipe that encapsulates authentic Puerto Rican flavors:

- 2 cups canned coconut milk
- 1 cup full-fat coconut cream
- 1 cup of your favorite plant-based milk (e.g., almond, soy, or oat)
- 3/4 cup of light or dark rum (optional)
- 1 cup of sweetened condensed coconut milk (store-bought or homemade)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- Pinch of salt

To prepare, simply combine all ingredients in a blender. Blend until smooth and creamy. Then, pour the mixture into a bottle or jar and refrigerate for at least an hour. This allows the flavors to meld beautifully. Serve chilled, and be sure to give it a good shake before pouring. Garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon or a cinnamon stick for an extra festive touch.

Creating a Vegan Coquito is not just about substituting ingredients; it‚Äôs about honoring traditions in a way that includes everyone. The coconut base is rich and satisfying, making it a delightful alternative to dairy-filled recipes. This ensures that your holiday gatherings can accommodate all guests, whether they are vegan, lactose-intolerant, or simply health-conscious.

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
The tradition of coquito isn't just limited to the drink itself; it is also about the memories made while preparing and sharing the beverage with loved ones. This vegan variation enables you to include friends and family who may not usually partake in the rich flavors of coquito. You can also encourage sharing recipes and experiences, turning beverage-making into a fun holiday activity that everyone can enjoy.

When exploring the idea of Vegan Coquito, consider the importance of quality ingredients. Using fresh, organic coconut milk and extracting the rich flavor of coconut cream brings out the best in this delightful drink. Whether you opt for store-bought or homemade versions of coconut milk, choose brands that are minimally processed to enhance the overall taste and health benefits.

It's also worth noting that coquito is incredibly versatile. Feel free to experiment by adding various flavors or ingredients. A teaspoon of chocolate syrup can create a chocolate coconut twist, while a little espresso can add a coffee-infused kick. You can adjust spices according to your taste‚Äîadding cloves or cardamom can provide an even richer experience.

As the holiday season approaches, embracing vegan traditions like Vegan Coquito can foster a spirit of inclusivity. With a delicious, creamy drink that embodies the flavors of Puerto Rico, you can ensure that everyone has a seat at the table. These cherished moments of sharing and celebration are what holidays are all about, and a Vegan Coquito is the perfect drink to help celebrate the spirit of togetherness.

The Benefits of Coconut in a Vegan Diet: Nutritional Highlights of the Vegan Coquito Recipe
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coconut is a superstar ingredient in many vegan diets, and its versatility shines in various dishes. One such delightful treat is vegan coquito, a traditional Puerto Rican holiday drink that captures the essence of coconut goodness without the dairy. Whether you're enjoying a cozy gathering or simply wanting a sweet treat, this festive beverage is sure to impress. Beyond its delicious flavor, coconut offers an array of nutritional benefits that make it a fantastic addition to your vegan lifestyle.

First off, let‚Äôs explore the nutritional highlights of coconut. This tropical fruit is rich in essential nutrients that support overall health. Here are some key benefits:

- **Healthy Fats:** Coconut is primarily made up of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), a type of healthy fat that provides quick energy and may aid in weight loss by boosting metabolism.
- **Fiber Content:** The flesh of the coconut is packed with dietary fiber, which promotes digestive health and helps maintain a feeling of fullness.
- **Vitamins and Minerals:** Coconut contains important vitamins such as vitamin C and several B vitamins, as well as minerals like magnesium, potassium, and manganese that are essential for bodily functions.
- **Antioxidants:** The antioxidants found in coconut can help combat oxidative stress and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

The coconut‚Äôs creamy texture makes it a perfect ingredient for vegan coquito. By using coconut milk or cream, you can easily recreate the rich, smooth mouthfeel typical of traditional recipes. Plus, coconut milk is naturally dairy-free, making it an excellent substitute for those avoiding animal products.

When preparing vegan coquito, you're not just making a tasty drink; you're also incorporating all these health benefits into your holiday traditions. Making vegan coquito typically requires coconut milk, sweetener, spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, and sometimes a splash of rum for that festive kick. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of how coconut elevates this delicious drink:

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
- **Creamy Base:** Coconut milk gives the coquito its signature creaminess without any dairy, ensuring a rich taste that everyone can enjoy.
- **Natural Sweetness:** The natural sweetness of coconut pairs beautifully with spices, creating a balanced flavor profile that enhances the overall drink.
- **Easy to Customize:** You can adjust the coconut flavor according to your taste, whether you prefer a lighter coconut extract or a bolder, fresh coconut presence.

Besides being an incredible base for coquito, coconut offers various forms you can enjoy in your vegan diet. Fresh coconut meat, coconut water, shredded coconut, and coconut oil can all add unique flavors and health benefits to your meals. Try adding shredded coconut to granola, using coconut milk in smoothies, or even substituting coconut oil for other fats in baking.

Another reason to consider coconut in your vegan lifestyle is its easy accessibility.

1jmobqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jmobqu/one_week_down_feels_like_im_coming_apart_at_the/,One week down : feels like I'm coming apart at the seams.,"I realized recently that I've been using caffeine for close to 30 years.  It started as soda as a teenager, then became tea and soda, and then I hit on coffee around 10 years ago.  That quickly progressed to an espresso machine on my counter and a nice double shot every morning.  Then an occasional second coffee as a treat.  I was probably between 200-300mg on a daily basis.

&nbsp;

I planned on tapering over 3 weeks, but ended up tapering down to 0 over seven days.  By the end I could hardly stand the sight of the espresso.  I noticed throughout the taper that I would get headaches every day in the early afternoon.  Nothing too intense, and nothing too concerning.

&nbsp;

After the last day with just a sip of coffee, things changed.  I noticed a marked increase in anxiety and a general feeling of being overwhelmed.  Basically every night since then I wake up in the early morning with an overwhelming emotion of dread and anxiety.  It feels like my brain can't break out of an overstimulated loop.  I latch on to one thought only to be interrupted by another.

&nbsp;

I tried to describe this sensation to a friend and settled on this image.  It feels like for years my brain was laser focused and could jump from task to task with little thought or effort.  But right now it feels like my brain is unfolding and all those tucked away random emotions, memories, and thoughts are rushing back to me.  And that sensation is overwhelming to the point that it feels like sensory overload.  And anxiety is the end result.  Sleeping helps (until I wake up), being distracted helps, and writing this post helps quite a lot.

&nbsp;

No chance I'm going back to caffeine after this, but just wanted to share my experience as this sub has kept me sane while I feel like my digestive system and brain are being hammered in various directions.  Thanks to everyone else who has shared similar trials they have gone through.",2,1743260890.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I have Marfans, which you can google if you want. I look relatively normal, but I have a decent amount of health problems internally. It's not good if I'm being honest. I have around 8 specialists following my case as of now. Used to be more.

Back in the beginning of 2020, I had a bad complication and almost passed away. After getting better, I moved to a new city and made new friends. I haven't told them about my health problems. Like, at all. I've mentioned in passing that I was sick a bit in my youth, but I made it sound like I'm all better now. I'm not. It is unlikely I will have a normal lifespan. I'm 28 now and my prediction is I will likely be dead before 50 - this is based on my current health, the lifespan of my family memebrs with Marfans, etc. Maybe I'll be wrong - idk.

I used to be open to tell people about my disorder, until I almost died. Then it just became so real, I didn't want to say anything. My friends here think I'm just a normal person. I want to be a normal perosn. God, I wanrt to be well. I can't keep this lie up.
My friend is trying to set me up with someone - a nice man, a really good guy. I'm 28, and people don't know why I won't date. I say that I just am not ready, which is a stupid excuse.

In reality, I can't have kids. When I almost died, I had a bad complication and anyways, I'm infertile now. And even if I wasn't, pregnancy can be deadly for people like me. And trying to explain that to someone I'm dating sounds like a fucking nightmare. And I just want to hide it. I want to hide it and wake up and it was a nightmare and I'm normal.

My friends don't know about all the medication I take every day, or the countless doctor appointments, or that I might not be around for as long as they think. I have good lies to explain away my surgery scars. I tell them I don't like the flavour of coffee instead of the fact that it fucks with my heart. I shouldn't even be drinking really, but we all have vices. I'm a shell of what I should be. I don't want them to ever know, but I feel like at some point it'll come out and they'll be mad that for years I hid something so big from them. They have every right to be mad. I've hidden so much from them. I'm a stranger masquerading as a friend. How fucked up is that?

There's no solution. There isn't a cure. I will get worse over time. Sometimes I dream of moving very far away and befriending no one and just disappearing in a quiet life of being alone. Sometimes I dream of sleeping and not waking up. It's a nightmare to be like this. I keep dreaming of things I can't have. And I keep secrets from everyone I'm close to, because the truth is ugly and scary. I can't believe i have such good friends when I'm such a fuck up of a person.

I've probably gone in person around a¬†dozen times and superficially interacted with the¬†receptionist to the extent of ""good morning"", ""have a nice weekend"", ""where's the coffee machine"" and ""I need some help connecting to the copier's wifi"". Always friendly, but we know NOTHING about each other beyond our names and our occupations.

I've been dealing with a medical condition since December (not a pregnancy) that caused my abdomen to noticeably bloat. A few weeks ago I had a procedure done to treat the issue and I dramatically dropped 10+ lbs and 2 pants sizes. I've been dreading the awkwardness if/when I hear comments about it. I don't want to talk about my medical problems with anyone other than my husband and my doctors.

Yesterday the receptionist at work asked (in front of others no less!) if I'd had my baby. I scurried away to the conference room and cheerfully replied, ""No. Just lost some weight!""

My boss overheard it. She and I were both speechless for a minute. I had to explain to her that I've been exercising more and watching my diet (both true, and the latter especially true because it relates to managing my medical condition). She said it doesn't really matter if I gained weight or lost weight because DUH this is a sensitive topic.

While I was in a meeting, I overheard the receptionist telling a delivery person about her faux pas. During the meeting I was also thinking in the back of my head how mortifying it's going to be when I have to pass by reception to leave. I think she heard me packing up because she wasn't at her post when I left. My boss left before I did and I overheard her asking my boss if I was ""okay"". My boss assured her I was fine.

FWIW, I am also in my early 40s and have fertility issues, but I'm at peace with not having children.The question didn't feel insulting. My feelings aren't hurt. I'm just completely WRACKED with secondhand embarrassment! Like I can't stop thinking about it because it's the worst case of foot-in-mouth I've personally experienced in a long time. The bloating made me look a few months along. What if I HAD been pregnant and I miscarried?! Good lord.

I can't believe people still manage to bungle this. I mean... I remember being 5-6 years old and asking my mom (privately) if my overweight aunt was having a baby and being advised not to ever ask questions like that directly to the person.

I work at a large, well-known children‚Äôs hospital. Multiple women, including myself, have reported a male coworker for harassment. At least three formal complaints have been submitted to HR, and I suspect there are more.

His behavior includes:
	‚Ä¢	Repeated inappropriate comments and unwanted attention in the workplace.
	‚Ä¢	Appearing at places we frequent outside of work‚Äîsome of which were only mentioned in passing during conversations (e.g., gym, coffee shop).
	‚Ä¢	Acting in a supervisory role when our regular supervisors are out, creating a power imbalance.

HR has acknowledged the complaints but taken no visible action. He is still employed and the behavior continues. Some of us are feeling unsafe and have begun changing our routines.

Questions:
	‚Ä¢	What legal options, if any, do we have when internal reporting fails?
	‚Ä¢	Is this considered a hostile work environment under the law?
	‚Ä¢	Would it be appropriate to consult an employment attorney at this stage?

There are also people that are asking if he‚Äôs worth it so I want to answer that. I am a former patient of Dr. Keiser. I was injured from the COVID vaccine. It left me bedbound, wheelchair bound and most days I couldn‚Äôt sit up. I couldn‚Äôt swallow- I could barely breathe at times- and during Christmas I had to lay in bed with a plate of food with the lights off eating with my hands because I couldn‚Äôt open my eyes. I would have these flares that felt like seizures. My heart rate would get to 190 lying down and I would just start convulsing. My husband had to drag me into the shower so I could wash my hair with the lights off. I would go to the ER, neurology, they all had no idea and they told me it was all in my head. They gave me Xanax and sent me on my way. No one would help me. I had just had my son 2 years prior and I was preparing to die. Then my husband somehow came across a YouTube video about Dr Keiser- and this woman had a similar experience. This led us to do a deep dive into what chiropractic neurology was. Yes, a lot of functional neurologists are chiropractors- we found that they do extensive training in neurology beyond their chiropractic degrees. We had nothing to lose so we took a shot. We drove from Florida to Michigan and did 2 weeks with him. This man saved my life. Throughout all his testing, we found that damage that had been done to my body- I had small fiber neuropathy, POTS, vertigo, and I had lost the blood flow in my head. Every time I stood up I lost 50% blood from my head. He did this through a tilt table test. Through his treatments all of that has been resolved. Don‚Äôt get me wrong- it was commitment and work on my end- I had to continue exercises at home with his team‚Äôs support if I needed it. My amazing husband helped me do this. Now I am up making coffee, playing video games with my son and no longer in a wheelchair or bedridden.  I am forever grateful to Dr Keiser and his team for giving me my life back, giving me hope and giving my son his mom again. To those comments about him just being a chiropractor, I will say this: the type of doctor doesn‚Äôt matter- what matters is if they can help you. I went to plenty of ‚Äúreal doctors‚Äù and MD‚Äôs that just threw drugs at me, had no clue what to do and just told me I was depressed. You don‚Äôt get depressed overnight after getting a vaccine. They didn‚Äôt care. The best decision I made was to get care from him and treatment was worth every penny. They gave me paperwork to submit to my insurance company and my insurance even reimbursed me for like 50% of my treatment. I‚Äôm not here to try and convince anyone- but this is my story. Dr Keiser saved my life and I will always have so much gratitude for him and the chiropractic neurology profession. ",3,1743260565.0,POTS,8,0.71,False
1jmo78u,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhaven/comments/1jmo78u/warning_about_ero_cafe_in_new_havenracially/,"Warning about Ero Cafe in New Haven‚Äîracially charged, unprofessional behavior from the owner","I‚Äôm 23 year old, a Black man who lives in New Haven and a Yale student ( only saying this because maybe people will listen ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), and I‚Äôm sharing this because what happened to me at Ero Cafe on WOOSTER st was not just unprofessional‚Äîit was dangerous.

A while back, I left a critical but respectful (3 star) review about their coffee. I hadn‚Äôt been back for myself since then, but I recently stopped in to pick up a matcha for my girlfriend.

(3/19), the owner called out my full name as soon as I walked in‚Äîdespite me always going by ‚ÄúPaul‚Äù in the shop. It felt like a clear attempt to put me on the spot publicly over the review. I didn‚Äôt respond or engage.

 (3/20), I came back again just to pick up another matcha. The first thing out of her mouth wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhello‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat can I get you?‚Äù‚Äîit was, ‚ÄúAre you going to update your review?‚Äù I calmly asked why she called my name out yesterday, and instead of having a conversation, she started raising her voice, talking over me, and saying things like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cut me off, I‚Äôm talking to you,‚Äù in a way that was condescending and hostile.

Then it escalated‚Äîshe pulled out her phone and started recording me, saying I was making her feel ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù and ‚Äúuncomfortable.‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt raised my voice. I wasn‚Äôt even upset. I was simply trying to explain myself.

But we all know what those words mean when directed at a Black man. ‚ÄúThreatened‚Äù and ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù are the same words that have justified calling the police, ruining lives‚Äîor worse. I felt it in my body immediately: that shift in the air when your dignity, your safety, and your very presence are suddenly up for debate.

This reminded me of what Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in Between the World and Me, when a white woman shoved his son and he was the one threatened with police action for speaking up. Coates wrote:

‚ÄúThis moment is emblematic of a broader theme in the book: the fragility of Black life and the constant vigilance required to navigate a world where even basic dignity can be denied without consequence. It underscores Coates‚Äô central argument that Black people in America live under a system that does not protect them, but rather sees them as expendable.‚Äù

That‚Äôs exactly how I felt. Like my calm didn‚Äôt matter. Like my humanity didn‚Äôt matter. Just her performance of fear was enough to shift the blame onto me.

She told me I come in ‚Äúevery day‚Äù and that I‚Äôm trying to hurt her business, which is not true‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt ordered anything for myself since that original review. I‚Äôve spent almost $200 there, and I was met with gaslighting, disrespect, and ultimately a situation that could have ended very differently if I didn‚Äôt stay composed.

If you live in New Haven and you believe in holding businesses accountable for how they treat Black customers‚Äîespecially Black men‚Äîthen don‚Äôt support Ero Cafe. What happened to me isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúbad customer service experience.‚Äù It‚Äôs part of a much larger pattern we see across this country.

We deserve to be treated with dignity. Not framed.

I ordered an espresso and a pourover; my partner had the hygge chai and everything was fabulous; we sat-in and played a game of crib and while we were playing the barista brought over some coffee for us to try, and while they were dialing in a new roast they gave me another espresso from that process.

Started 7weeks ago, 4 x .25 2x .5 3rd @ .5 today. I‚Äôve lost 2.4kg or ~5lbs. Have had no adverse reactions, barely noticed fullness but a definite disinterest in continuing to eat. Only tiny bit of difference between .25 and .5‚Ä¶ or so i thought.

Thinking about it, I changed my eating habits with the help of two apps to plan meals and ensure the macros and micronutrients were all within recommended range, with a guesstimate as to my deficit.

As a wheelchair user it‚Äôs pretty difficult to judge what deficit actually looks like for me. And due to my fitness and weight problems that deteriorated over the wort of the pandemic. 

 7 months in hospital on a unrelated issue and having a working from home contract, I‚Äôve become more or less house bound and had to get a ‚Äúhospital style‚Äù chair which I‚Äôd rather be seen dead using in public (i don‚Äôt know, it is the one real vanity I‚Äôve had related to my lifelong disability).

I felt that I‚Äôm more limited than ever so the diet of take way food and alcohol had to go. I started with the diet and actually bothering to cook myself something to eat. The act of doing something kind of energised me I guess.

I wasn‚Äôt able to get an accurate weight since leaving hospital so I used the last weight I had recorded in hospital in May ‚Äò24.

I digress (blame the dyslexia)

Realisations:

3-4 cups of coffee a day down to 4 in the last month

One take away on average per 2 weeks ( unable to finish mostly) instead of multiple per week complete.

Used to be pretty heavy on the beer, 10 x 440ml cans in one sitting compared with one 330ml can and disinterested rather than full now. I know sobriety would be more appropriate but in relative terms it‚Äôs far less damaging.

Next step would be to continue another round at .5 to see if there is progress now that weight measurements are available. And once I‚Äôm fit enough to start exercising, I have the resistance bands in my drawer to get going.

Onwards and downwards or something like that.

## What to Expect from the Meta Quest 3: A 2025 Perspective

While the official details are still under wraps, we can make informed predictions about the Meta Quest 3 based on current trends and Meta's previous releases.We'll explore the key areas where improvements are expected, including performance, display, mixed reality capabilities, and overall user experience.

### Enhanced Performance: Powering the next Generation of VR

One of the most anticipated improvements in the Meta Quest 3 is a important boost in processing power. We expect a next-generation chipset that delivers substantially better performance than the current generation. This means smoother frame rates, higher resolution textures, and more complex and immersive VR environments. For VR gamers, this translates to a more responsive and visually stunning experience, allowing developers to create more ambitious and demanding games. This increased processing power should also result in faster loading times and improved multitasking capabilities, making the headset more versatile for various applications. More specifically, enhanced performance should also translate into better hand and object tracking, allowing a more visceral connection to the VR and MR experiences.

### Visual Fidelity: A Feast for the Eyes

A sharper and more vibrant display is practically guaranteed. Expect higher resolution panels, perhaps with increased refresh rates for smoother visuals and reduced motion sickness. Improved lenses are also likely, potentially moving towards pancake lenses for a wider field of view and improved edge-to-edge clarity. This combination of factors will contribute to a more immersive and comfortable viewing experience, making VR more enjoyable for extended periods. For casual gamers and entertainment seekers, this means movies will be more captivating, social VR experiences will be more realistic, and virtual travel will be more breathtaking. Furthermore, improved resolution and clarity will be vital for business and development applications requiring detailed visuals and accurate spatial awareness.

### Mixed Reality Mastery: Blurring the Lines Between Real and Virtual

The Meta Quest Pro introduced advanced mixed reality (MR) capabilities, and we expect the Meta Quest 3 to build upon this foundation. Improved passthrough cameras with higher resolution and color fidelity will allow for a more seamless integration of the real and virtual worlds. This opens up exciting new possibilities for augmented reality applications, allowing users to interact with virtual objects superimposed onto their physical habitat. Imagine playing a virtual board game on your coffee table or collaborating with colleagues on a 3D model in your living room.For businesses and developers, this enhanced mixed reality could revolutionize training simulations, product design, and remote collaboration.

### Design & Comfort: A Refined Experience

Comfort is crucial for extended VR sessions. The Meta Quest 3 will likely feature a more ergonomic design with improved weight distribution and better adjustability. New materials and padding could enhance comfort, while a smaller and lighter form factor would also be a welcome advancement. Thes design refinements will make the headset more accessible and enjoyable for a wider range of users, from casual gamers to business professionals.

### Software & Ecosystem: Expanding the VR Universe

Meta's software ecosystem is a major strength of the Quest platform. We anticipate a continued expansion of the meta Quest store with a broader selection of VR games, applications, and experiences. Improved social features and enhanced integration with Meta's othre platforms could make the Meta Quest 3 a central hub for social interaction and entertainment.

### audio: Immersive soundscapes

while often overlooked, audio plays a critical role in creating a believable VR environment. Expect improved integrated audio solutions, possibly with spatial audio capabilities, which further immerses the player into the game, simulation or training exercise. The integrated mics should also be improved which enhances the social connection between players or co-workers.

## Meta Quest 3 vs. Quest 2: A Generational Leap?

For those who already own a Meta Quest 2, the question becomes: Is the Meta Quest 3 a significant enough upgrade to warrant the investment? Let's break down the key areas where the Meta Quest 3 is expected to surpass its predecessor.

### Performance and Graphics: A Noticeable Difference

The Meta Quest 3's upgraded processor and graphics capabilities should provide a tangible performance boost compared to the Quest 2. Expect smoother frame rates, higher resolution textures, and more visually complex environments.This will be particularly noticeable in demanding VR games and applications. For VR gamers, this translates to a more immersive and enjoyable gaming experience, while for businesses and developers, it opens up new possibilities for creating more realistic and engaging training simulations and virtual prototypes. Early adopters and tech enthusiasts will certainly appreciate the cutting-edge performance improvements.

### Visual Clarity: A Sharper View of the Virtual World

The higher resolution displays and improved lenses of the Meta Quest 3 should provide a significantly sharper and clearer image compared to the Quest 2. This will reduce eye strain and improve overall visual comfort, making VR more enjoyable for extended periods. The improved visual clarity will also benefit productivity applications, allowing users to work with text and graphics more comfortably in VR.

### Mixed Reality Capabilities: A World Apart

While the Quest 2 offers basic passthrough capabilities, the Meta Quest 3 is expected to deliver a much more refined and immersive mixed reality experience. The higher resolution and color fidelity of the passthrough cameras will allow for a more seamless integration of the real and virtual worlds. This opens up exciting new possibilities for augmented reality applications and collaborative experiences.

### Comfort and Design: evolution, Not Revolution

While the Meta Quest 3 is expected to feature a more refined design and improved comfort compared to the quest 2, the overall form factor will likely remain similar. Expect subtle improvements in weight distribution, adjustability, and materials.

### Price point: Balancing Features and Affordability

The Meta Quest 2 was praised for its affordable price point. The Meta Quest 3 is likely to be more expensive,reflecting its enhanced features and performance. Though, Meta will need to strike a balance between price and features to remain competitive in the VR market.Potential customers will be eagerly anticipating the Meta Quest 3 price proclamation.

[[Explore Top Rated used meta quest 3 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/oculus-quest/?kw=used meta quest 3)
## Meta Quest Pro vs.Meta Quest 3: A Shifting Landscape

The Meta quest Pro was positioned as a high-end VR headset targeting businesses and developers. If the Meta Quest 3 incorporates many of the Quest Pro's advanced features at a more accessible price point,it could potentially blur the lines between the two products.

### Feature Overlap: Pro Features for the Masses?

The Meta Quest 3 is likely to inherit some of the key features of the Quest Pro, such as improved mixed reality capabilities, face and eye tracking, and self-tracking controllers.This could make the Meta Quest 3 a compelling alternative to the Quest Pro for users who don't require all of the Quest Pro's high-end features.

### Price Differentiation: A Key Factor

The price difference between the Meta Quest Pro and the Meta Quest 3 will be a crucial factor in determining which headset is the right choice for different users. If the Meta Quest 3 offers a similar feature set at a significantly lower price,it could cannibalize sales of the Quest Pro.

### Target Audience: A Clear Distinction?

Meta may choose to position the quest Pro as a premium headset targeting specific business applications, while the Meta Quest 3 is aimed at a broader audience of gamers, entertainment seekers, and casual users.However, potential buyers still will consider the Meta Quest 3 vs Quest Pro feature set. A key determining factor would be if the Meta Quest 3 augmented reality performs well enough that businesses could leverage it for production applications at a reasonable price.

So which facilities should I bother upgrading versus just refurbishing infinitely? Is refurbishing even necessary? And when is the best time to do facilities projects like that (ie certain financial situations? Time of season?)

I stayed behind after working at the cafe to help bartend  the event (which I was planning to do and it was a lot of fun). I could do a visual sweep of the cafe area when leaving and make sure it wasn‚Äôt terrible.

 Sorry I was told to leave and that the other store would handle everything and they left the stupid broken patio furniture outside all night Yeah I should‚Äôve dve came back at fucking midnight to do it guess.

 I sent to the work chat exactly what was happening and that the patio stuff would be handled. They weren‚Äôt and I wake up to a picture of them outside, no text just a picture of two lil shotty tables and 4 chairs sitting outside. Yeah how devastating sorry should‚Äôve fucking known.

I am not saying there is only large families with 3 or 4 kids all around me, but it certainly feels that way, also with people blaring the American flag or steers on their windshields, sure I'll roll with it.

The only thing I like about where I live is the work I am now able to find. I grew up in an economically poor state, and I knew that in my late twenties if I wanted to increase my income I would need to move. I did just that, moved to a larger big city, tripled my income, and now that I'm making past six figures I am more addicted, and obsessed with work than I have ever been. I also have no friends to hang out with, since I don't find families of 4 good mates since I have no kids, no ex wives, and no debt at 33.

I also have this weird ostracized way I look at society- when I go out, coffee shops, restaurants, malls, anywhere, I have to have my work laptop since I work remotely, and I work whenever I want secretly off the clock, constantly, improving work processes and sometimes just meddling with power bi dashboards (coloring them in different ways, it's unnecessary, but it feels more meaningful if it's for a manager to go ""Oo"" in 5 seconds at the end of the month than my internet friends.

The idea of being alone, sipping coffee, not wearing a suit or some way to look professional somewhere terrifies me now. I don't want to look like I am alone without a job, because that means I'm a loser, and with a job I can provide for myself, or at least I have that, because women don't like me anymore.

 A job is the most essential thing in my life, I work towards it when I am off, on the clock, trying to solve issues in my head when I'm about to sleep since it takes that much work with programming and troubleshooting tech issues from my experience.


Part of me does think this could be slightly narcissistic or vain- I care about what people think of me and let it dictate my life in how I leave my house or appear. But, I do truly love technology, and computers and figuring out puzzles, it's just kinda lame I feel anxious and insecure when I leave my house if I don't have a family, and that's what I am trying to say I think?

It's like I'm in a prison of society where if I don't have a family, then I have work, and so why not just work all the time. I have hobbies, but hobbies don't make me six figures.

My thoughts are wondering if any other man in his mid 30s with no wife has had this dilemma, or if is going to be a regret of mine in my 50s?",3,1743259443.0,emotionalintelligence,0,0.81,False

I even would ask my coworkers that were the ones training me if there was anything I should improve on or if I'm moving too slow and they said I was doing good for my first week. On Friday I got called in the office randomly and I found out I got fired. I was shocked too because I was told my performance has been bad so they decided to get rid of me after less than a week actually 5 days. The worst part is they had me scheduled for the next week so I didn't even see it coming at all. I'm a little annoyed that they really got rid of me that quickly because of bad performance if it was really that much of an issue I wish they really just warned me first that I was doing something wrong or moving too slowly because they never told me anything.

I know poor performance is a okay reason the fire someone I get it. I just don't understand how they didn't even give me at least a month to get acclimated. It seems like my coworkers thought I was doing all right I guess the operations manager didn't see it like that or my coworkers just lied to me.

1jmno7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1jmno7o/i_had_sex_with_my_straight_coworker/,I had sex with my straight coworker.,"Throw away because he‚Äôs on here lurking and I don‚Äôt want him to know how I feel.

I (29m) work in a hotel where we have 2 to 3 people manning the front desk every shift. (I‚Äôm very lucky to have that because my anxiety by myself fucking sucks.) I work with mainly three different people interchangeably. An elderly woman who is married, a young mother, and a straight man (34m) who we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúGreg‚Äù.

Greg and I have kind of built up a relationship where we take turns cooking for each other every week. Because we‚Äôre on 3rd shift we are normally the only two by ourselves during the night. While the other two ladies would normally just play a board game, cards, or whatever, Greg and I would watch TV shows, use the kitchen, and occasionally play on my Switch when it‚Äôs REALLY slow. Greg has always been honest with me about everything. And to be fair, he is attractive. Being open about my sexuality, I have told him that if he were gay or bi, there would be a lot of guys who would definitely go after him. He laughed and said that that‚Äôs ‚Äúgross‚Äù because ‚Äúanal isn‚Äôt his thing‚Äù. We‚Äôve talked about sex, but because he‚Äôs slightly religious - what I‚Äôd like to call ‚Äúdiet Christian‚Äù - he believes ‚Äúbeing gay‚Äù is a ‚Äúsin‚Äù under his genre of Christianity, but he says that as long as he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt partake‚Äù in ‚Äúsuch activities‚Äù, his religion won‚Äôt ‚Äúshun him‚Äù. I told him it‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôm not religious because if anything, I love who I am. Thankfully he doesn‚Äôt believe (like most ‚Äúin your face‚Äù Christians) that me being gay associates with pedophilia. He‚Äôs also told me he‚Äôs an ‚Äúally to an extent‚Äù (meaning he supports his gay/bi friends, but doesn‚Äôt really support everything in the community). Because of his honesty with me, I‚Äôve always been honest with him.

One night, Greg invited me over to his apartment on the other side of town. Mind you, this is about 5 months into our working relationship. We‚Äôre both off on Fridays, but this particular week, we were both off on Friday and Saturday. I hesitated a bit because he‚Äôs never really showed interest in hanging out with me outside of work. We‚Äôre very buddy-buddy at work but outside of work we don‚Äôt text each other unless it‚Äôs work related or what we‚Äôre making for dinner. I finally agreed to hang out with him.

When we hang out in his apartment, not much really happens at first. He introduces me to his two small dogs, then starts making the couch a bed ‚Äújust in case I pass out early‚Äù. He starts rolling a blunt and hands me a bottle of whiskey. The blunt was just to relax, but the whiskey was going to be a drinking game. He said ‚Äúany time I mention anything that could be *gay*, I have to take a drink‚Äù. I take the bet.

We‚Äôre halfway through the blunt and only a couple drinks in when he tells me he‚Äôs curious about sexual things. He asks me about how it feels for men to have sex with men. He asks me what my favorite position is. He asks me about my previous relationships. I tell him one of my saddest stories about an ex abusing me. He then starts throwing an arm over me to hug him. It could‚Äôve been the weed and alcohol talking, but he said I was ‚Äúcute‚Äù and he said he‚Äôd ‚Äúnever treat me that way‚Äù if he was my boyfriend. I return the hug, staying leaned against him.

As I said, Greg is attractive. He‚Äôs tall, has big hands, green eyes, has an athletic build, and has a jawline that could cut glass. I admitted to him that I have a slight crush on him as I‚Äôm cuddled up to him. He smiles at me and kisses me on the cheek. I told him that was very sweet. Before anything escalated, he got up to put his dogs in their cage. He comes back in only his boxers. This was the first time I‚Äôve seen him shirtless. Like, happy trail and all, I started to drool a little.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be shy, take off your clothes,‚Äù he says. I‚Äôm very hesitant about that, too, because my body isn‚Äôt as fit as his, but I do it anyway. He turns on the TV, then sits back down beside me. His arm goes back around me, pulling me into him against his pec. He starts caressing my shoulder and arm. Maybe about three minutes in, he starts guiding my hand to his bulge. I didn‚Äôt pull away. I was feeling the vibe. He looks at me and says ‚Äúgo ahead‚Äù as in ‚Äútouch it‚Äù. We start getting hot to where we were kissing. His kissing wasn‚Äôt the greatest, but this was an opportunity I couldn‚Äôt pass up. He grabs my ass, then tells me to sit in his lap. I follow along as we make out. He puts his hands down my briefs and I feel him slide them down. He starts grinding against me, pushing my hips against him. He wanted it so bad that I just said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù. I got naked and he goes to get lube from his room.

After having sex, he lays down on my chest and says ‚Äúit was nice‚Äù. I complimented his size as I run my fingers in his hair. He said that I was the first guys he‚Äôs ever boned. After about an hour of cuddling and talking more, he gets up, kisses me good night, and he goes to his room.

Surprisingly, the next morning wasn‚Äôt awkward. He didn‚Äôt treat me like I was an invader nor like I was his boyfriend. He just started cooking breakfast fully dressed. I get my clothes on to make a pot of coffee to help him out. He thanks me for the experience - which again, was jarring because he wasn‚Äôt treating me like I was gross. We eat breakfast in semi-silence, only talking about plans for the day. I get ready to leave to go back to my place.

Alcohol is borrowing happiness from tomorrow!! Remembering that is always the most helpful. 

When I was actively drinking I would get so obsessed with getting more or mapping out when, and how much I would purchase. I stopped drinking socially and ONLY drank alone at home. Hiding my drinking. Terrified of someone seeing my credit card statement.

I wouldn‚Äôt drink socially, I‚Äôd decline. I only drank at home and I would constantly cancel plans because I was too drunk to leave my house. It was such a dark, depressing place to be. Which is weird because I kept telling myself I deserved it and it was okay. 

I hid my drinking, my empties, my glass, my bottle, my struggle, and I really think ultimately I hid my potential and happiness FROM MYSELF. 

I was in a constant vulnerability/ alcohol hangover. I‚Äôd call and text people while I was drunk at home. I‚Äôd pick fights with my spouse. I‚Äôd deny it when he asked if I was drunk. 

Looking back at that person just 12 days ago is so unreal to me. 

It‚Äôs so easy to forget. I‚Äôm being harsh on myself for eating chips and ice cream and worrying about weight gain - it actually amazes me how I could even be harsh with myself when I‚Äôm not drinking and that is the greatest thing and something to be proud of!!! 

Thank god I‚Äôm having coffee, slept, and can leave my house and do whatever I want today because my life isn‚Äôt revolving around drinking and the consequences of drinking.

\--

The year is 2401. After the incident on Frontier Day, Starfleet was forced to make sweeping changes to its crew assignments to ships. As such, Starfleet has recalled former officers who would do well in command positions, as well as internal promotions and reassignments. A meeting was called in which assignments would be given. This precedes that meeting.

We are in a cafe on a Federation Starbase. There is a line of Starfleet officers waiting to order; they serve real food here. Others are seated and eating, some alone, some with others in idle conversation.  An officer steps up to order.

""One Prune Juice.""

We still do not see the face of this officer, but our suspicions of who is it are confirmed by a voice that comes from behind him.

""Is that the only Klingon brave enough to drink prune juice with a bat'leth straw?""

We see Worf's face for the first time, all closeup. In an earlier time, he would have been frustrated, but he works to keep his calm. He still responds, as he turns to see who spoke to him, ""I do not drink with a straw.""

Worf sees who spoke to him before we do, and with a slight tone shift, says who it as just as we see:

""Captain Mariner?""

Captain Beckett Mariner is sitting at a cafe table alone, a mug in one hand, with some food and a PADD on the table. She must have just sat down moments ago. She smiles to him.

""Worf, Son of Mogh. You better get that prune juice and come catch up with your old friend because I could use an excuse to avoid some work right now.""

We see Worf in full for the first time. He himself is in a Starfleet uniform, wearing Captain pips. A barista behind Worf's back has prepared his prune juice and is about to hand it to him, when, as Worf responds to Mariner, there is a silent interaction where a second barista pulls the drink back and removes the straw from it, moments before Worf sees.

""It is pleasant to see you, however, I have an important meeting to attend.""

Worf turns back and takes his prune juice. He begins to turn to leave, but Mariner isn't having it.

""I have the same meeting. We have time. Admiral Janeway's leading it and everyone knows she'll stop here beforehand.""

Everyone around nods. One of the baristas says, ""We have a fresh pot always ready for her. Still full.""

Worf begrudgingly admits defeat and goes to sit with Mariner.

""So is this another attempt at Captain Worf? Didn't realize you were back in uniform, did being back on the D make you want to relive your glory years?""

""I am still in my glory years!""

""Don't you want to go back and relive those times? You folks in TNG got to do so much exploring strange new worlds and seeking out new civilizations. The galaxy was so much easier back then.""

""You were a child, life often seems easier. What is TNG?""

Mariner gives a smirk when Worf asks this. ""Oh, just what Boims calls the time Picard and all you were on the Enterprise D. The Nerd Group, because you were all nerds, doing all that science and discovering artifacts and lost civilizations all the time.""

""There were also countless battles in which we fought and were victorious.""

""Exactly, those were your glory years. When was your last battle - before Frontier Day?""

""I no longer seek out battle, I believe there can be peaceful solutions to most problems.""

Mariner almost spits out her drink. ""Wait, um excuse me, but how does the man who kill the Klingon Chancellor become, what, a pacifist??""

""The strongest warrior can defeat his enemy without raising his sword.""

""I never heard that Klingon Proverb.""

""It is not a Klingon Proverb.""

""It'd make a good one. So they pulled you back to the Captain's chair?""

Worf responds with some pride, ""Yes, my experience as a Starfleet officer and ship captain was deemed invaluable in light of recent events. With honour I accepted.""

Mariner joked to her Klingon friend, ""Must be pretty invaluable if Starfleet is willing to risk nearly losing another ship? You're really good at that.""

""I am not good at nearly losing ships.""

""You sure about that? First there was the 1701 D...""

It cuts from Mariner to an animated recreation of the events of the Enterprise D at the end of *Star Trek Generations*. The style may be similar to one we've seen before in Star Trek, or an new style. We see a shorten sequence of events, Duras attacking the Enterprise, the warp core breach, and the ship crashing on the planet. These are both ship shots and of events in the ship. Key lines of dialogue are heard from the film that explain very simply what was going on. After the crash, we return to Worf and Mariner.

Worf retorts, ""That was not my fault.""

""An undetected security threat leading to the enemy being able to bypass shields is not the fault of the chief of security? How did I not know this Regulation loophole?""

""Everyone on the ship survived and Duras was defeated. We were victorious.""

""And then there was the Defiant...""

It cuts away again, now to the Borg attack on Earth in *Star Trek First Contact*. It is a different animation style than the last flashback. Here we see the battle prior to the Enterprise's arrival, including shots of Worf as Captain of the Defiant and other bridges. The flashback sequence concludes with the Defiant nearly being destroyed and the crew being beamed aboard the Enterprise. We cut back to Word and Mariner again.

""That was not my fault.""

Mariner continues the somewhat playful argument. ""The ship literally built and designed to fight the Borg barely lasted against a single cube.""

""Do not underestimate the Borg. And we would have lasted the battle if not beamed out by the Enterprise.""

""I heard you were preparing for ramming speed. Sisko would not have been happy""

""Who told you that?""

""Lips sealed, scouts honour."" Mariner replies. ""And then there were so many times with the Enterprise-E....""

There is another transition to animation. This time, we see a variety of different flashbacks, each shorter than previous but enough to clearly establish what is happening, and each in a different animation style:

There is the Enterprise E fighting then ramming into the Scimitar, as seen in *Star Trek Nemesis.*

There is the Enterprise E succumbing to the effects of Living Construct from *Star Trek Prodigy*.

There are two or three additional sequences, not previously seen, that involves the Enterprise E nearly being destroyed. In each Worf is seen on the bridge, at times clearly as Captain of the ship. These sequences are less specific as to the threat, only that each imply that the ship is nearly destroyed.

Back to the real world, Worf, despite attempting to remain his calm self, was agitated by Mariner's barrage. ""Those were not my fault.""

""Which one was it that actually ended that Enterprise?"" Mariner asked, actually honestly unsure, ""I wonder if I have enough clearance now for those logs.""

""I suspect you do not."" Worf replied, regaining the conversation, ""But I recall you had many incidents on your record back during the war. I suspect that trend continued. Perhaps we can analyze that next.""

We focus back to Mariner, who reacts to something she sees behind him. ""No time Captain. The Admiral is here for her java. Duty calls.""

We see Admiral Janeway enter alongside Captain Tuvok, in the background, going to pick up her coffee, while Captains Mariner and Worf de-materialize their dishes in the middle of the table and stand to leave. Others in the cafe do the same. We hear Mariner and Worf's conversation fade into the distance off screen.

""Ohh, and didn't the Klingons nearly destroy DS9 because you upset Gowron?""

""That was not my fault.""

Janeway gets her coffee and turns to leave. It is now her, Tuvok, and the baristas in the previously full cafe. 

She sips her coffee. ""Mmm. So much better than Neelix's.""

Tuvok nearly smiles. Fade to black.",9,1743258742.0,startrek,1,0.74,False

First, all the routes ranked:-

Hisui>kohaku>=ciel>akiha>arcueid

Arcueid:-

I think arc's route is just solid. Thing is, Arc's development here just feels really lacking both compared to the remake Arc and the other OG heroines. I mean, the OG arc route doesn't even have the 'I love you' scene where she jumps around the roofs all happy and stuff. That scene was peak, which also makes the romance aspect of this route feel weak compared to the other heroines. The best thing about this route is shiki's characterization, which is still just as good as the remake imo. The scene where he apologizes to Arc for the first time, the time where he talks about doing pointless things and having fun with it to Arc. This is what makes the route great. I honestly Can't remember Arc having moments like this that makes me love her more in the OG. overall, Shiki is what makes this route solid, otherwise it feels lacking.¬†

I also didn't like the good ending. Way too happy-go-lucky for me. As if whatever happened in the past didn't really matter.

Ciel:-

OK so, I have seen people call this route meh but I have to disagree with that. I personally really enjoyed it. Of course, the remake Ciel route is better because it simply has more going on but the OG route is still just as great. I think this route does a really good job at balancing both Ciel's and Shiki's development. The scene where shiki talks about how he doesn't want to die because he had fun, even if it was a lie. Ciel realizing she can't kill shiki and all the small moments like how Ciel will do anything to find a cure for shiki makes this route and the romance great. The ending part where she was crying when shiki stabbed himself made me tear up too. I also enjoyed Arc as an antagonist.

My problem with this route is that roa's possession of shiki kinda doesn't makes sense. I mean, SHIKI was still alive, why was roa possessing nanaya then? And why does this not happen in Arc's route? I also have the same problem as arc's true ending where the good ending is happy-go-lucky this time. Overall, a really enjoyable experience.

Akiha:-

Despite my lower ranking, I actually quiet enjoyed her route. It just the other routes are better. shiki and akiha talking about their childhood at night, shiki realizing that he is not a killer because of Ciel, Akiha letting all her feelings out to shiki, made this route memorable to me. And the true ending where shiki, a guy who doesn't like killing, who doesn't think death is the answer, actually dies. The true ending devastated me. Even the normal ending was sad af.Hope red garden gives akiha a happier ending than this

What makes this route low for me is the romance part. I mean, I am just not a big fan of incest. That's all there is to it. I can't help but laugh hard when shiki says shit like, ""akiha is not my sister, she is my woman"". This route also felt a bit dragged out at times. But still a fun route regardless

Hisui:-

ABSOLUTE CINEMA. I genuinely can't think of anything bad to say about this route. I never thought that nanaya spending most of the route in his room without even being able to move at all would be the most fun I ever had reading a VN. Seriously, shiki getting brain damage and his decent into madness is the most exciting and simultaneously the most sad thing I have ever read. Just imagine, when you go to sleep your body dies faster than your mind because of SHIKI hurting himself and when you try to wake up, your head starts aching hard immediately. So you are stuck waking up, sleep, waking up, sleep and repeat. Just thinking about it makes me sad.¬†

And Hisui...man.....Hisui is such a goddamn treasure. Something about her coming and checking up on shiki, Her little smile, all those small moments with shiki, just made me smile so hard.I could totally understand shiki.makes the romance great too. And when you learn the reason as to why she doesn't want any man to touch her, she instantly became the best girl for me. I can't believe my favourite heroine in this VN turned out to be the most sane one. Also both the endings in this route were great too unlike the other routes.

And of course, the kohaku plot twist. I did not see that coming. Remember how I said hisui is best girl few sentences ago? Scratch that, kohaku best girl.(jk, both are equally my favourites). She was the last piece to make an already amazing route absolute cinema. I will talk about her more in her section.

There's also makihisa. Imma be honest, I really thought this guy was going to be some kind of a secret chad character or something, but he turned out to be thatüíÄ

Kohaku:-

Alright, kohaku. The character that,imo, made the far side routes the best and really a memorable one. This route was a really enjoyable one for me too because I liked how they handled kohaku here. Those small moments where she showed a bit of emotion whenever shiki mentioned the handkerchief, the moment when she teared up when Shiki finally fulfilled his promise, made me love her more. I also can't believe this but one of the best moments in her route was the hentai. For a character, who acts like a doll, someone who has never received genuine love made the eroge scene a lot more impactful for me, especially the after sex talk. But what makes her the best written character is that I simply can't understand her character fully. The pain she went through as child, how she hated shiki to the point of tears, I could never truly understand that. That's why, what makes this route so satisfying is when she realizes that she doesn't have to be doll, that she can enjoy her life too. Even if she was just acting, as long as she is having fun, she doesn't have to feel bad. The coffee scene with SHIKI and akiha as a villain was great too.

The problem I had with this route is that it's a bit short. I think they definitely could have gave kohaku more development because it feels like they jumped to the end bit too quickly. And nanaya actually murders people this time (I think?) but nothing of consequence happens to him. Bro also doesn't really question it that much either, so idk what that was about.

Yumizuka:-

Her character was good for shiki's development. Uhhhhh....idk what to say anymore. She just dies in two out of the three routes. shiki just murders her while licking his lips. Hey atleast she is getting her own route in red garden.

Part 2

Nanaya Shiki:-

shiki, to me, is the best type moon protagonist(the gap isnt big tho. If shiki is 10 then the others are 9.9 or 9.8). Most of type moon stories have this message of 'To live your life', which I think shiki conveys it the best. Even though he is the closest to death, he always has the mindset of enjoying his life, even the small moments. The line about 'everything will become a lie,if I die' and 'even if it was pointless, a mistake, I still want to keep living on' sums it up the best. I also like how,in a way, he influences the girls too:-

1. Arc learns that even if what they were doing was pointless she can still have fun¬†
2. Ciel learns that she doesn't have to die because of her sin and continue living¬†
3. Hisui learns that she doesn't have to take kohaku's place and be a doll. She can gradually take hisui's place and fulfill kohaku's dream
4. Kohaku learns that she doesn't have to be doll and that she can enjoy her life even if she doesn't know whether or not she truly enjoys it.¬†
5. IDK about akiha, shiki dies in her route. She coping bro she coping.

And its kinda cringe, but he influenced me too. Watching his story unfold in both the og and remake also encouraged me to enjoy the little things in life too. That's why it devastated me when he killed himself in akiha route¬†

Shiki, who has a really weak body, someone who can die any day, doesn't worry about his death and continues to enjoy every moment of his life. Which is made even clearer in the epilogue scene with Aoko. That's what makes him the best for me.

General(neg):-

These are mostly just nitpicks and didn't really deter my enjoyment of this VN:-

1. chaos was boring as hell. I really didn't get the hype
2. both arc vs ciel fights were meh. This isn't talking about visuals as I really enjoyed SHIKI vs nanaya and crimson akiha vs nanaya in the far side. The writing itself was boring as arc just overpowers ciel way too quickly
3. this just a me problem, but I kinda expected to learn more about the nanayas even though they are not necessary to overall story but still kinda hoping for it to be included in red garden
4. the music doesn't loop properly. Nothing too big just took me a bit of time to get used to
5. the word 'aghast' is used too many times in akiha's route

Conclusion:-

This honestly turned out to be one of my favorite piece of media ever. Even after writing all this, there's still a lot I want to talk about cause theres just not enough words to explain all those emotions I had while reading it. And not just happiness but also felt regret finishing it because I won't be able to experience this for the first time again.

Shiki and the maids were my favorite part about this VN. Especially the maids. The maids are on par or even surpasses saber for me. They are just that good.

I will be honest, I first wanted to recommend the remake first to people but after finishing the OG tsukihime I have changed my mind. The og despite its flaws is still an amazing VN that I want more people to read. I am not saying it's peak media or something but it's definitely something worth experiencing

Tsuki remake:-

I wanted red garden to release as soon as possible but after reading far side routes I honestly want nasu to take his time with it Because holy shit they have a lot to unpack with both og and remake stuff. I am mostly curious as to how they would handle kohaku's character and hisui route while also incorporating all the arach and saiki stuff.

I hope shiki gets some kind of a new ability too. I am tired of my boy getting slandered just because ryougi apparently has better eyes than him",3,1743258577.0,Tsukihime,1,0.67,False
1jmnhsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeautyCircle/comments/1jmnhsa/peter_thomas_roth_instant_firmx_temporary_eye/,Peter Thomas Roth - Instant FIRMx Temporary Eye Tightener,"Have you ever looked in the mirror after a particularly rough night and thought, ""Wow, when did those eye bags move in and set up permanent residence on my face?"" That was literally me about three months ago. I'd been pulling way too many late nights finishing client projects, and my under-eye area was essentially screaming for help. That's when I decided to try the Peter Thomas Roth Instant FIRMx Temporary Eye Tightener after seeing it all over my TikTok feed. And honestly? I've got some thoughts.

# What Makes Peter Thomas Roth Eye Tightener Different?

The beauty industry is absolutely flooded with products promising to magically erase signs of aging around the eyes. Trust me, as someone who's been writing about skincare for over seven years, I've seen (and tried) pretty much everything. But the Peter Thomas Roth Instant FIRMx stands out because it takes a different approach.

Unlike most eye creams that promise results over weeks or months, this product is specifically designed for immediate, albeit temporary, effects. It contains a blend of three key ingredients: a proprietary Firma-CELL-4 complex, sodium silicate (which creates that tightening effect), and peptides that help with the appearance of fine lines.

The first time I squeezed a tiny amount onto my finger, I noticed the consistency was different than other eye products I'd tried - it had this slightly tacky, gel-like texture that dries quickly. It's not exactly what I expected, but I've learned that sometimes the weirdest-feeling products deliver the most surprising results.

[Check out the Peter Thomas Roth Instant FIRMx on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3E8aoTl)

# The Science Behind the Temporary Tightening

So here's what's actually happening when you apply this product. The sodium silicate (sometimes called ""liquid glass"") creates a temporary film that physically tightens the skin as it dries. It's essentially like creating an invisible mask that pulls everything together.

I'm generally pretty skeptical about instant-results products because they often rely on optical blurring or simple hydration that dissipates quickly. But the mechanism here is different - it's actually providing a physical tightening effect that you can feel working.

The peptides in the formula are there for long-term benefits, though I think we need to be realistic about what a temporary product can actually accomplish in terms of lasting results. I do appreciate that Peter Thomas Roth didn't just stop at the quick fix but included ingredients that might provide some cumulative benefits.

# My Personal Experience Using the Eye Tightener

The first time I tried this product was actually before an important video call with a potential client. I was running on about four hours of sleep and looked... well, let's just say I looked exactly like someone running on four hours of sleep. Not ideal when you're trying to project competence and professionalism!

I applied a very thin layer as directed (and trust me, you really do need just a tiny amount) and waited. The instructions say to remain expressionless while it dries, which gave me about 3-5 minutes of enforced meditation time - probably not a bad thing for my stress levels anyway.

The sensation as it dried was... interesting. There was a definite tightening that you can physically feel, almost like having a light clay mask just in your under-eye area. Not uncomfortable, but definitely noticeable.

But the results? I was genuinely surprised. The puffiness had visibly reduced, and those lovely dark circles that had taken up residence under my eyes looked significantly less pronounced. Did I look like I'd had a full 8 hours of beauty sleep? Not exactly. But I looked markedly more awake and refreshed, which was exactly what I needed.

# The Good, The Bad, and The Slightly Awkward

Let's talk about the real pros and cons based on my experience:

The good: When applied correctly, the results are pretty impressive for a topical product. The effect lasted about 6-7 hours for me before gradually fading. There's no heavy fragrance (which I appreciate as someone with occasionally sensitive skin). And a little goes a very long way - I've been using the same tube for three months with plenty left.

The not-so-good: There's definitely a learning curve here. My first attempt had some flaking because I applied too much product. If you try to apply makeup too soon after, it can pill or roll off. And if you're very expressive or smile a lot immediately after application, it might crack a bit.

Perhaps the most awkward aspect is that you need to remain relatively expressionless while it dries. I made the mistake of trying to apply this in the car once (as a passenger, don't worry!) before a dinner, and trying to keep a straight face while my husband was telling a funny story was... challenging. Probably not the best product for on-the-go application!

# How to Apply It Correctly (Learn From My Mistakes!)

After some trial and error, I've figured out the optimal way to use this product without the common pitfalls:

1. Start with completely clean, dry skin. Any oils or residue will prevent it from adhering properly.
2. Use the tiniest amount possible - seriously, about half a grain of rice per eye is sufficient.
3. Pat (don't rub) gently under the eye and on the orbital bone.
4. Remain expressionless for 3-5 minutes while it dries completely.
5. If you see any white residue, you've used too much. Don't try to rub it away - instead, dampen a clean fingertip and gently pat to dissolve it.
6. Wait at least 5 minutes before applying any makeup over it.

I've found that it works best when I build my morning routine around it - I apply it right after my serum, then brush my teeth or make coffee while it dries, before moving on to the rest of my routine.

One tip that made a big difference: I store mine in the refrigerator. The cold not only feels amazing during application but seems to enhance the tightening effect and helps with puffiness reduction even more.

# When to Use It (And When Maybe Not To)

This isn't an everyday product for me - it's more of a special occasion or ""emergency intervention"" solution. I reach for it when:

* I have an important meeting or event and need to look refreshed
* After a night of poor sleep when my eyes need serious help
* For photo occasions when I want to look my best
* During allergy season when my eyes tend to look puffy regardless of sleep

I wouldn't recommend using it daily for a couple of reasons. First, it's not really designed as a treatment product that improves your skin over time. Second, the tightening effect, while temporary, does put some stress on the delicate eye area. Everything in moderation, right?

It's also probably not the best choice if you have extremely sensitive skin or active eczema around the eyes. The tightening agents might cause irritation for some people.

# How It Compares to Other Eye Products I've Tried

I've used a lot of eye products over the years, from luxe brands to drugstore finds. Where does the Peter Thomas Roth Instant FIRMx stand in comparison?

For immediate results, it's honestly one of the most effective I've tried. Most eye creams promise results after weeks of consistent use, and even then, the changes can be subtle. This delivers on its promise of instant tightening in a way that few other products do.

However, it's important to understand what this product is and isn't. It's not replacing your nourishing eye cream or retinol treatment that works on long-term improvements. It's more like the skincare equivalent of shapewear - it gives you an immediate fix when you need it, but you're not permanently changing anything.

Price-wise, at around $38 for the tube, it falls somewhere in the mid-range of eye products. Considering how little you need per application, the cost per use is actually quite reasonable compared to some luxury options I've tried.

# The Bigger Picture: Temporary Solutions vs. Long-Term Skincare

This product has actually made me think a lot about the balance between quick fixes and long-term skincare strategies. There's sometimes this purist attitude in the skincare community that anything temporary isn't ""real"" skincare. But I think that's a bit unfair.

Yes, consistent routines with proven ingredients like retinoids, peptides, and sunscreen are the foundation of good skincare. Those are the marathon strategies that really pay off over time. But sometimes you need a sprint - a quick solution for a specific situation. And that's okay too!

I've incorporated this product into my overall approach in a way that makes sense: I continue with my regular eye care routine for long-term benefits, but I keep the Instant FIRMx as my secret weapon for those days when I need an immediate boost.

It's kind of like how I approach my diet - I focus on nutritious, balanced eating most of the time, but I'm not going to turn down a piece of birthday cake for the momentary joy it brings. Balance in all things, including skincare.

# The Viral TikTok Effect: Does It Live Up to the Hype?

Let's talk about the elephant in the room - this product went mega-viral on TikTok, which is actually how it landed on my radar. Those before-and-after videos were DRAMATIC. People with significant under-eye bags appearing to have them completely disappear in seconds.

So does it really deliver those jaw-dropping results? Yes and no.

In my experience, the results are visible and impressive, but perhaps not quite as miraculous as some heavily filtered TikTok videos might suggest. The effect is most dramatic on people who have primarily puffiness rather than dark circles or fine lines. The product can temporarily tighten puffiness very effectively, but it doesn't have pigment to conceal dark circles (though the tightening can make them less noticeable).

I think what we're seeing with many viral beauty products is the perfect storm of legitimate results combined with favorable lighting, some filtering, and the natural enthusiasm of discovering something that works better than expected. The product does work - just set your expectations based on reality rather than perfectly lit social media videos.

# Final Thoughts: Is It Worth Adding to Your Routine?

After three months of using the Peter Thomas Roth Instant FIRMx Temporary Eye Tightener, would I recommend it? For the right person and the right purpose, absolutely.

This isn't going to replace your comprehensive eye care routine. It's not going to permanently banish fine lines or structurally change your under-eye area. But as a temporary solution for special occasions or those mornings when your eyes need serious help? It delivers.

I appreciate that it does exactly what it claims to do - provide a temporary tightening effect - without making outlandish promises about permanent transformation. In a skincare world full of miracles-in-a-jar claims, there's something refreshing about a product that's honest about being a short-term fix.

So if you go in with realistic expectations, understanding that this is more of a special occasion product than an everyday treatment, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by how effective it can be. Just remember - less is more, patience during drying is essential, and keep your regular eye care routine going for those long-term benefits.

And maybe keep it in the fridge. Trust me on that one!",1,1743258564.0,TheBeautyCircle,0,1.0,False

1jmngs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1jmngs1/first_time_on_dream_concierge_not_worth_it_for_us/,First time on Dream Concierge- not worth it for us,"My honest Disney cruise review

We‚Äôre a family of 4 with 2 kids: 3 and 6. Were not huge Disney people and this is our first Disney cruise. We did a 5 day on the dream to the Bahamas- Nassau, castaway Disney private island & lookout Disney private island. Typically when traveling, we  love good food, supporting local restaurants and avoiding tourist traps and crowds when we travel.

A cruise is cool in theory but when all the destinations are Caribbean beaches without much difference, it makes you wonder how this might be any better than just staying at a resort on land. There were so many activities planned and different stops, it made me feel like I had a busy vacation instead of a relaxing one. The Disney aspect of course was appreciated by our kids. Just seeing the characters walk around the ship, getting Disney on demand in our room TV, and the ship projecting Disney movies during the day while they swam at the pools was cool enough for them. Which again, for the price tag, probably wasn‚Äôt worth it for our family. I wish day at sea was earlier vs later to explore the ship and do all the specific sea day things like brunch at palo/remy & royal gathering. 

Food
Cabanas buffet for breakfast is chaotic. It‚Äôs hard to find a table, there are lines for food, and it‚Äôs loud. But it‚Äôs probably the same quality as a sit down restaurant and you can get in and out with your kids faster. We ended up just grabbing plates and bringing them to the room to eat. Cabanas lunch is more chill probably because some people are off boat and schedules vary more so it‚Äôs less crowded. Lunch has crab legs and shrimp so that‚Äôs always a plus. Rotational dining dinner is also chaotic. All restaurants on rotational dining have the same menu. Animators palate gave me anxiety. You just look around and see this huge room just filled to the brim with families.  Royal palace although better, was still very loud and filled with guests. Expect the servers to literally be running (they‚Äôre awesome but they work SO hard), hear constant crying & yelling, and to hold a conversation with only the people closest to you. Bring a drink to dinner, cocktails will take forever and the servers don‚Äôt have time for that. The food is decent if you order correctly- like B grade but the atmosphere is a D. The only items we really enjoyed from rotational dining were: mushroom ravioli, rack of lamb, escargot. Room service is a very limited menu. I thought we could use it more but we just ended up ordering the same 3 things for the kids (tomato soup w grilled cheese, chicken tenders, salad) when other options were closed/ timing didn‚Äôt work. 

Palo and remy far exceeded my expectations on food. They work hard to distinguish the quality from rotational dining and we were very happy with our dinners at each one. The service was next level and the options match a Michelin starred restaurant- extensive water menu, high end wine pairings (dom & krug), supplemental caviar & cheese courses, etc. You can get away with a relatively cheap dinner (palo $50pp, remy $135pp) or walk away paying a lot of money with a la carte and supplemental offerings! Highly recommend these 2 dining options and getting a cocktail at meridian beforehand. Palo brunch was also great. So nice to get away from the crowds and noise for a bit.

Room
We had an amazing concierge room with a deck. Our travel companions did not have a table in their room and thus they couldn‚Äôt order room service and their internet wasn‚Äôt free despite being concierge status as well. The beds and pillows are comfortable and the blackout curtains are supreme. There are no shelves, now I realize why everyone packs their kids clothes in those foldable hanging shoe racks. We had 2 showers and a tub and everything was meticulously clean. We had 1 king bed, 1 Murphy twin bed and 1 pull out couch bed and the staff would come in every afternoon to pull out all the beds and close the sliding pocket doors to give the king bed area privacy. They would come back in the morning and recreate a living space for more room. The cleaning crew is next level. They‚Äôre awesome. Tip them. 

Activities:
Sign up for the kids detective agency whenever you see that there isn‚Äôt a line and on the first or 2nd day. My 6 year old loved this and it‚Äôs a way to get some steps in. We signed up for 3 excursions but only made it to 1. Note to self: don‚Äôt sign up for excursions unless they are 1 hr long with little kids. Dolphin swimming excursion was going to be 6 hours long and they waited around for an hour before deciding just to stay on the boat and swim. Really read the fine print to determine how much time the excursion activity is vs down time & transit time. The pirate excursion on lookout cay was cute but really meant for 4-5 yr olds (3 was too young and 6 was pushing the upper limit) and it was a walk under the hot sun- apply sunscreen religiously, I got burnt. Get the aqua duck water slide on the boat out of the way early and when the wait time is 10 min. Do not wait longer than 30 min. If there‚Äôs a 45 min wait, do something else and come back later. Fireworks at sea on pirate night were cool but probably not worth it for kids 5 and under. They start at 10:20pm and end around 10:30pm. It‚Äôs late at night and fireworks on land will be more impressive likely.  It‚Äôs a fun touch, but not worth keeping little grumpy kids up for. Do not pay $200 per kid for the bibbidi boutique. Bring your own princess dress and do their makeup/hair/nails. It‚Äôs very expensive and that experience was cool and cute but only 20 min long.

Kids club is a great offering but checking in was painful. It takes forever. Kids forget their bands and need new ones, name tags are made, sliders are put on, lots of putzing with the computers. I was always running late for a dinner reservation if I was checking into the kids club. Utilize check in both at the oceaneers club AND at the lab- they are connected and the lab usually has a lower wait time. The kids clubs on the islands might be good for an hour or less but they are far less impressive than on the ship. On the island it‚Äôs like a mini splash pad with tables and shade. We never dropped the kids on the islands because it didn‚Äôt look too appealing to them. Our kids liked the clubs but they weren‚Äôt begging to go back every day. We used them for 2-4 hrs while at a meal or at the spa 4 of the 5 days. 

Concierge level:
Room was great but it‚Äôs probably not worth the cost. The concierge lounge had nice little snacks and soda but not enough for a meal and not always kid friendly flavors. The lounge had no ocean views so while it was nice, I didnt want to hang out there. The sundeck with the private hot tub and free sunscreen was nice but there wasn‚Äôt a lot for the kids to do up there. Free booze from 5-10pm but we had maybe 2-3 cocktails each night and elsewhere on the ship they cost $15 so it doesn‚Äôt even out in price. The early check in time at port and on ship was nice but Disney has their own port (not shared with other cruise lines) so it seems pretty streamlined and clean all over. Priority walk off with baggage was a nice touch but again, not sure if it‚Äôs worth the price. We got early booking access but we didn‚Äôt really need priority access to excursions or cabanas so it was really only helpful for the spa and restaurant reservations. As long as you‚Äôre on top of timing, and check back for cancellations, you should be fine.

Recommendations:
get the rainforest pass to escape the crowds- 100% worth the cost
Skip concierge for the lounge/ sundeck privileges and just take advantage of the adult only areas on the ship, they were never too crowded 
Book brunch at remy & palo once at the Nassau day & brunch once at sea day
Book dinner at remy & palo both one time
Prep for cushion time- kids club check in / out takes forever, buffet lines take forever (kids are going through them), even getting water on the island takes forever (there‚Äôs always someone ahead of you filling 5 massive water bottles)

I am so done with dating. I am a pretty good looking guy, dress well, fit, and work a high paying job. A big physical downside is I'm 5'7. But overall, I have been very confident in being proactive meeting new people, flirting, and asking women out. 

It's a lot of rejection and being led on, and when I do go on dates, it never ends up leading to anything and it feels like I'm just used for free coffee or drinks. I've been seeing this one girl who I've been casually hooking up with, but I'm not even that attracted to her.

This is all such a shit show - just know that you can be short and make up for it with confidence and all that other BS, but you're still scavenging for crumbs at the end of the day, and all the higher quality women aren't even looking your way.

I just have some general questions on the student body (which I have already heard is really amazing). 

1. I have heard amazing things about the students at Dartmouth but I just wanted to clarify that the majority are chill I guess. My biggest concern is just the stereotype of students at ivies. Are the students negatively competitive with each other, is it really cliquey, and as a low income student, would it be hard to connect with my peers?

2. Okay this one is more lowkey but I seriously am devastated there is no chipotle or like a big mall. What stuff would I enjoy that is more in the area of Hanover? Obviously I want to be involved in the outdoor club and will cherish being in nature but I also want to know some of the best places in town and any coffee shop recommendations. 

3. I don't know for sure, but I am considering getting involved in greek life and I just wanted to know how expensive it is. I can only attend Dartmouth because I recieved a pretty large scholarship, so I wanted to know if I would even be able to join a sorority since it might be too expensive. Also, would you say sororities would care that my family doesn't have that much money? I am from the south so I just want to know if greek life at Dartmouth is vastly different from southern schools.

Being vulnerable carries an inherent risk but with right person makes it all worth it

I think most of us are afraid in some sense to love and to be completely vulnerable yet despite the risk we long for it.

I find myself deeply longing for a sincere and profound connection. Hopefully, you are looking for the same?

The capacity to love, sometimes even in the face of pain, is one of the most beautiful aspects of being human. It's a strength, and not always a weakness.

At my core, I'm a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear.

Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I've realized that I have much love to share. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special.

I'm invested in my attempt to forge a connection and hope you are too, I'd try to share things about me that might give you idea of the person I am.

**Essence of Me:**

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I‚Äôm someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that‚Äôs both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one‚Äôs soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you ‚Äì not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

1jmn8hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jmn8hc/second_date_etiquette_question/,Second date etiquette question,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm recently back on the dating scene after a year of healing from an abusive relationship. Feeling pretty good about myself, I decided to give some men on hinge a chance and go on some dates! I matched with this one man, a year younger than me. I am a 32 year old woman. We went for a coffee and a walk which was fine we got on pretty well. Before the walk, he did text me and ask would I rather just him make me a coffee at his house which was near mine, I declined. As I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe to go to someone‚Äôs house I‚Äôve never met.

After the successful coffee date, he asked me to go for drinks a few nights later. He had to be home early as he was working early the next morning. I was very nervous as I‚Äôm not much of a drinker but I decided to live a little ( lol) and have some wine. I told him I only drink a few times a year. We went to the pub and he had 4 pints and I had 2 glasses of wine. We chatted for hours about everything and anything and got on very well. He isn‚Äôt my type physically but looks don‚Äôt matter much to me anymore. At 11pm he said it‚Äôs getting late and he has work tomorrow so we should get going. I asked did he want to share a taxi as we live down the road from each other. He looked at me and said ‚Äòmy place or your?‚Äô Taken a back and thinking he was joking I said what?? And laughed it off. He wouldn‚Äôt let it go. He said I‚Äôm serious why can‚Äôt I stay at yours? I said sorry I wasn‚Äôt expecting a visitor and would rather we wait till the next date. He pushed one more time to come over and I said no. He then stormed to the bathroom, came back to the table and seemed very angry. We left to go catch a taxi and he wouldn‚Äôt even look at me on the walk. He then opened the door to the taxi, I hopped in and he slammed the door, not joining me. I had foolishly assumed we would still share a taxi lol.

My question is, is this normal behaviour for a second date? I‚Äôve been out the game a while but is this expected, sex on the second date? To preface, there was zero physical touch on either date: no kissing no hand brushing nothing. To me it seemed like a bit jump to having sex. I‚Äôm just shocked as he didn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs all he wanted originally but his behaviour has confused me and now I‚Äôm nervous to ever go on another hinge date. Apologies for the long post!

1jmn7ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1jmn7ia/options_for_startup_loans_with_little_current/,Options for Start-Up Loans with Little Current Income,"The title mostly says it all. We're looking for a sizable loan, depending on if we finalize on this property we're currently looking at. Most likely in the 300,000-500,000 range. Both my partner and I have above 720 credit scores, and I believe a rock solid business plan (as a freelancer involved in copy, marketing, and fundraising I've helped with them before). I've had a successful LLC with my freelancing business and my masters degree and experience is heavy in marketing, business copy, etc. 

The problem is we have very low income. My partner is a coffee shop manager. She runs the entire shop, but it's still about $18 an hour. With tips, overtime, etc. She's probably at $35,000 a year. As I've been finishing my masters, I have not had what some may consider the biggest ""career"". I probably make about $40,000. Maybe a bit more. 

Of course, lenders care more about income than experience normally, and we're nervous to have other people sign with us. And though we have a house and quite a few acres of land, we'd rather not use it as collateral. However, we do not really have much else. 

We have a meeting with our best CDFI option Monday, but of course they interview 1,000 and pick 50. 

There is the option of doing commercial real estate for the property, an equipment loan, working capital loan, etc. but does that get as complicated as it seems?

I have some possible job options when I finish my masters, and I was definitely planning on working part time and continuing to freelance, but to take a full time job would put a LOT of strain on my partner to run it, and would probably get me a max of 65,000 starting.

1jmn7hn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmn7hn,Standout Pourover Experiences in Hanoi üáªüá≥,"I feel compelled to share a couple of the best pourover experiences I've ever had in Hanoi! It was incredible to explore the unique high-end cafe culture in Vietnam.

1) Darklight.Lab - This coffee bar is hidden in an alleyway in between some old French colonial buildings. When you find yourself there, you're greeted by the owner who's deeply knowledgeable about coffee and eager to share his offerings to find something to your taste. I chose a washed Gesha Village pourover, and it was genuinely the best pourover I've had in my life, the beans were incredible. Not sure where they were roasted. He took the time to allow us to smell the grounds before brewing and used the Paragon device with the frozen steel ball. For espresso drinks he used a Flair 58 and standalone steamer. The cafe had a cozy/homey vibe.

2) refined. - This cafe is at the second level of a high end clothing boutique, and has an intimate bar where they brew pourovers on a flat bottom dripper designed by themselves and I think inspired by the Vietnamese Phin. They also pull espresso on the Flair 58, and have extensive offerings for beans from a variety of Vietnamese options to high end Panamanian geshas. I got a Colombian Sudan Rume. Unfortunately it was not to my taste but that's because I did not realize it was an anaerobic natural whole ordering. I'm sure many would love it. My brother got a washed Kenyan which he enjoyed. I believe they also offer a coffee omakase. They also offer their own roasted beans.

3/4) I also visited Dream Beans and RAAW which I learned about on Reddit. Dream Beans' old quarter location was small and cozy, and the barista was really informative, with a wide range of offerings. I was in a rush so I didn't get to linger and got a takeaway that was very solid. I went to RAAW because I heard they offered Liberica, which I was eager to try as it is a different species from Arabica and Robusta. I found it to taste peanutty and almost like jackfruit and papaya, thought it was anaerobic natural. I had their tasting flight and beans to take home, which were solid. The cafe was a bit dead and felt a bit awkward, so I'm not sure if I'd go again.

Overall, loved exploring Hanoi, and when specialty coffee wasn't in reach, I absolutely loved the comforting ca phe sua da made with robusta and condensed milk over ice!",5,1743257719.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

I have heard all the parts of the `Lacerta Files` and I have to say that is is meticulous. Very well put interview together however some of the details about this interview made me to question this thing, not because of ‚Äúdisbelief‚Äù of this being potentially real but because there are some cracks in this **interview**.

# Word Delivery

First of all, this looks like someone gathered a group of people and choose what to talk about because about the science question Lacerta was all about ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt understand it‚Äù, ‚Äúi‚Äôm preserving you the knowledge because you can‚Äôt understand it‚Äù yada yada. There‚Äôs no reason at all why she shouldn‚Äôt explain the science unless the **writers didn‚Äôt know this**. Is like explaining some sci-fi fusion reactor like ‚Äúthis does this does that and then boom atoms there and if we can add the quantum particles we open the portal and boom light speed‚Äù type shit.



# Questionable Details

**The clothes and¬†mimicry**

Lacerta says she can use **mimicry** and can mask herself as a human or whatever she likes but why‚Ä¶is she in need to wear **clothes**? If she can do that to us then why is she in the need to explain how tight clothes are uncomfortable for her?

**The TR3-B¬†Details‚Ä¶**

She often says that the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù has this tech but‚Ä¶which government? If you can hear the videos or read the files again, she says ‚Äú**your government**‚Äù but isn‚Äôt this interview made in Sweden and TR3-B linked to the **United Sates of America** which she mentions this at the end of the files.

# My Honest¬†Opinion‚Ä¶

Lacerta Files was a good ‚Äúsmoke + beer + coffee‚Äù type of videos but my honest opinion from this are as follows:

**Drip Disclosure:**

Something to make the people more familiarized with the alien and the idea that species which are different from the humans live among us. They needed to tell us that new species is not a fiction and they live here so we can embrace this idea more.

**The Scientific Parts:**

I think this is within information coming maybe not only USA but also different countries. I think this is inside information and they have made a mix of **what they know**, **what they know but can tell**, **what they don‚Äôt know** and **what they know but can‚Äôt tell**.",0,1743257608.0,UFOB,11,0.5,False
