1kwjlez,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1kwjlez/the_newspaper/,The newspaper,"You placed your umbrella on the chair beside me  
and your newspaper on the table in front of you,  
without looking at me — not even once.

The rain was pouring,  
but I found comfort in its rhythm,  
sitting alone beneath the café awning.

You reached into your dark cloak,  
pulled out your cigarettes,  
and without sensing my nervousness,  
without knowing how closely I watched your every move,  
you took the sugar from my table —  
melted one cube into your coffee,  
and unknowingly, melted another into my heart.

The scent of your coffee drifted toward me,  
and I found myself traveling within the spirals of your smoke,  
carried by the air you exhaled —  
invisible, forgotten,  
yet somehow aching to exist in your world.

You were right there,  
yet so far —  
your eyes fixed on your newspaper,  
while I sat beside you,  
lost in a quiet storm,  
the rain hiding everything I didn’t dare say aloud.

If only you had looked at me.  
If only you could have read in my eyes  
the silent wars I was losing  
sitting so close to you.

You bewitched me.  
You lived in me.

And then —  
without a glance,  
without a word,  
without mercy,  
you took your umbrella from my side  
and vanished  
into the crowd.

Leaving your newspaper behind,  
forgotten —  
just like me.

I sat there, abandoned.  
A ghost of a woman.

And I remained —  
haunted,  
by a man — a stranger,  
whose absence echoes louder  
than any word he never said.",1,1748340700.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

She seems to constantly be dropping leaves and his leggy despite being in full sun. What should I do now? Should I cut her down in the hope to get some lower growth or is it time to give up?",2,1748340627.0,houseplants,0,1.0,False

1kwjjr2,https://i.redd.it/p22spvlzta3f1.jpeg,Future me is a dummy,"Hey there it's me, Ekko, or little man. Whatever it doesn't matter, what does matter is that my future self is stupid. Apparently future me inveted frickin time travel, like reverse time whenever you want. Apparently that wasn't enough for him so he started tinkering with the device and then, in my universe. I was hanging out with the gang, powder, vi, claggor, and Mylo when I needed to go toilet. Sounds unimportant till I noticed. Guess what, a bloody portal in the toilet doorway.

Like a big circular glowy, moving, blueish portal. Being the absolute genius I am I got curious and stuck my hand in it. The moment I did I got pulled in, like yanked so hard I thought my mother was about to beat me. I face planted and when I looked up there was a random adult who looked an awful lot like me but grown up, he was so shocked I wasn't even sure if he was still alive for a few seconds.

After the initial freakout and the various bad words he hurled around he managed to realize what he had done and who I was. I didn't realize who he was untill I heard a voice call out ""Ekkoooo"" singsongingly. Out walked a skinny white girl with long twin braided blue hair who looked and awful lot like powder but grown up. She was carrying 2 cups of a drink that looked like coffee but with little black balls at the bottom. 

Then she dropped them on the floor and pulled a gun on me and hurled about 5 times as many bad words as future me did. Long story short future me is trying to take care of me as well as possible without spiling future events that might rip the time stream apart. And the girl who I assume is future powder keeps drinking those coffee looking drinks at an alarming rate, its been half an hour and shes already had 6. Can anybody explain what the hell is happening? Cause I understand but at the same time... I dont",1,1748340521.0,arcane_roleplay,0,1.0,False

I wasn’t anxy or upset over him, I just… couldn’t. Plus my pillow is f’ing me off in every kind of way lately. It feels so LUMPY. But then I sleep on it and by morning it’s heaven? So idk what that’s about. I think my having these double shot coffee pods and not having one isn’t helping. I’ll be more mindful of my caffeine. Though I didn’t drink any on Friday or on the weekend, did I struggle to sleep those nights? I shall consult my journal. Journals are handy. 

M showed me this video on tt or ig or idk one of the social media ones I think tt but in my defence if it’s full screen they look the same?? Anyway. She said oh I bet you’d die for this and it was a video of a girl somewhere and she worked at a Starbucks and she met her partner as he was a customer and he continued to go get a coffee from her every/most mornings for 1-2 years. She’d write a cute note on his cup for him every time and HE KEPT THEM. He washed them out (I hope) and she found them stacked in his wardrobe :’) THAT is exactly what I want and would die for, yes. I just want someone who matches me in that sentimentality, maybe not *match* because I can take things too far but for a man to be close and just think that way and care about me and us that way. It was sooooo sweet. And he wasn’t showing it off to her which is the key bit, he just quietly kept them because he obviously loves her and they’re special to him. You don’t want someone pretending to be sentimental and romantic and lovey and you can’t ask someone to be that way or ramp it up, they either are or they aren’t. It’s like wanting your boyfriend to get you flowers but they mean nothing if you ask for them. Well no, I think that can still be sweet as it shows you asked and he acted on that - which is sweet in itself. But you just want to feel THOUGHT OF. Special. Well I do anyway, I think everyone on earth does. I don’t know if Andy is like that. He hasn’t been given an opportunity to show it tbf and I don’t expect that from him at this stage in things, I fully understand he’s not fully in this as he would be yknow, I have ZERO hard feelings about that. I used to, before we had a talk once and I realised. Sometimes I think I forget how difficult I’ve made things for us. I don’t forget as such though, it just sort of… isn’t front of mind? Idk. I’m a lot better with it now. I’ll still get upset or feel whatever sometimes but I try keep it to my journal as opposed to laying it out on him as that isn’t at all fair to him. None of this is fair to him. I’m the worst. Truly the worst. Anyway. ANYWAY. I just thought it was such a sweet lil video and I want that :’) 

I think I’m pms’y because everything feels so off today and I’m so sensitive about everything. 

I think I’ll go to the office tomorrow. Yes, I will. I might come home earlier, but mum asked me to have dinner with her after work so maybe I’ll stay for that. Not sure. I’ll see how I feel. 

I have my skin cancer spot check on Thursday. And my laser facial and therapy on Friday. I’m stressed about both. Not stressed but anxy. It will be okay. And then a long weekend. 

I love how warm my skin feels, idk how to write this without sounding weird but sleeping naked is so cosy and nice? When it’s not utterly baltic, that is - which case I will sleep with fifty jerseys on. But when you’re not wearing anything you get to feel how warm and soft and smooth your skin against your skin is. Like I’m lying on my side-ish right now and my boob is squished against my arm and it feels so waaarrrmmmm. Or sticking your hand between closed thighs. Why is it not something more PG sounding like resting my ankle on my knee? But it’s not the same. I guess ankles and knees aren’t squishy and fleshy. Fleshy is such an ick word, it makes me feel like a skin sack fills with gory stuff which let’s be real, is true. Well not GORY, my sweet blessed insides keep me alive and well so they’re wonderful but horror movies kinda gave them a bad rap. Rap? Rep? Rep. Oh. It is bad rap. Well both make sense but anyway. Anyway I guess I like feeling myself up in bed in a really G rated way. Can I perhaps *shut up now?* 

I’m halfway through my third book now. It’s objectively not a good series but whatever. The only time I seem to experience fomo is with books. LOOOOOOSEEERRRRRRRR. NERRRRRRDDDDDDDDDD. Not really like I don’t actually mean that but now all I can think of is Homer yelling NEEeEERrrDDD.  

Well once again he’s gone to bed/sleep. At least he told me this time? So that’s a small win…? What a win -_- oh well. Tbh I’m enjoying my nights reading anyway.

Any of you folks intrested in seeing one?,"So I’ve been seeing a lot of people either swearing by their pre workouts or completely winging it with whatever flashy tub they find online.

I was planning to write a deep dive post breaking this whole pre-workout thing down, top to bottom.

What these ingredients really do.
1) Caffeine 
2) Beta alanine 
3) Creatine 
4) Citrulline Malate
5) Tyrosine 
6) Taurine 
7) Theobromine

What’s worth your money and what’s pure nonsense.Because some of these are legit, and some are just glorified caffeine bombs that’ll have you itching and regretting your life choices.

How much of each ingredient you actually need because let’s be real, a lot of brands sprinkle in good stuff just for show, but it’s nowhere near effective dosages. I’ll break down the real numbers.

How to read these shady labels once you know what to look for, you’ll start spotting the scams from a mile away. Proprietary blends? Red flag.

Safer cleaner alternatives ( the classic black coffee with salt and Creatine)

Would something like this be helpful to you? If there's enough interest, I’ll put the time in and make it worth your scroll.

Context as short as possible: he turned out to be a controlling, abusive and manipulative person. Among other things, he used to ridicule people when their opinion was contrary to his, he pressured others to do what he wanted, and no one liked the way he treated his partner. He is also charming and charismatic, which turns out to be a dangerous combination with ridiculing people because his opinion is influential; all those bad traits are very subtle but evident when you look back and gather everything. Through the years most of our common friends left him; I also have some aspergers traits (a psychologist opinion) and that is probably why I keep being his friend - I don't make friends easily and I am not good at social relationships.

As I wrote, a couple of years ago we had a difference of opinions where he, as usual, pointed at my inability and lack of knowledge on the topic we were talking about as the cause of this difference. I told not to use that argument, on me and on others, because that hurt our self esteem. His answer was what at the end led us to the end: *who do you think you are to tell me how to talk to people,* followed by several personal considerations aimed to hurt my feelings.

Yesterday he wrote me literally *Do you feel like having a coffee together one day?* I really don't want to meet or talk to him or try to settle things up and be friends again. I don't need that person in my life. My question is: How would you answer him in the least hurtful way, declining his invitation, and also not leaving much hope to change my mind in the future?

He didn't hesitate—just left me there and rushed off to bring her home.
Within hours, Selena posted intimate photos of them together. 
The background? Our bedroom.
Then came Thaddeus's message:
""I got drunk at that party, and Violet is pregnant. I need to take care of her.""
""Once she gives birth, I'll send her to Europe to finish her medical studies. ""
""You can raise the child—it'll only know you as mom！""
When I didn't respond, he added,
""About our marriage registration... we have to postpone it after Violet delivers the baby.""
I stared at my phone screen, laughing until my eyes turned red.
Did he really think I, the only heiress of the Lockhart family, had no options but him?
I immediately called Archer Reynolds:
""Marriage—interested?""

I suppose my continued silence finally prompted Thaddeus to call.

His voice carried a hint of urgency.

""Selena,don't overthink this. You're the only one in my heart. With Violet, it's purely admiration. That night was truly just an accident!""

""I understand,"" I replied, my voice unnervingly calm. ""That's what men do, right?""

Silence stretched across the line for several seconds before I heard him take a deep breath.

""Where are you? I'll send the driver to get you. Violet's uncomfortable, and I really can't leave her away...""

I cut him off""No need.""

His voice suddenly turned cold,

""Selena,are you angry now? I've explained everything clearly. Violet will leave after the baby is born. What more do you want from me?""

I felt suffocated,unconsciously clutched my marriage certificate, struggling to keep my voice steady.

""Thaddeus, let's break up.""

He paused, then let out a bitter laugh.

""After all these years, don't you know how I feel about you? Yes, I made a mistake, but what man doesn't? I'm already making up. Do you really so strict with this?""

I closed my lips,without any words.

I stayed silent, his patience finally broke out. ""Fine!Whatever!Let's break up!You'll be back here crying within the half hour!""

The line went dead with a sharp click, leaving me nothing but the dial tone.

I took a taxi and returned to what was once our home.

Not for begging him, but simply to pack up my things before leaving.

When I pushed the door open, Thaddeus stood there wearing an apron, the dining table laden with carefully prepared dishes.

He and Violet sat facing each other, eating and laughing together.

He gently served food on her plate, even tenderly feeding morsels directly to her lips.

That gentle expression on his face—I had naively believed it only belongs to me.

I remembered when I cooked for him, he would embrace me from behind, whispering in my ear""Thank you, baby.""

It seemed nice, yet throughout our five years together, he had never once made me even a simple cup of coffee.

He was the youngest cardiothoracic professor at the country's most prestigious medical school.

His always told me ""My hands are for surgery,they must be protected at all time.""

Even when holding my hand, he was excessively cautious.

Yet now, here he was, breaking his own rule to cook for Violet.

When Thaddeus spotted me,letting out a cold laugh and giving a knowing look that said, “I knew it.”

Violet greeted me with manufactured enthusiasm: ""Selena!You're home! Would you like to join us for dinner?""

I silently walked past her, heading straight for the bedroom.

""Stop right there!"" Thaddeus jumped to his feet, his face darkening ominously. ""Violet is speaking to you. At least you could response her. Have you no basic manners at all?""

I turned slowly,curling into a cold smile.

""How exactly would you like me to respond? Should I thank her for eagerly carrying my fiancé's child, making me an instant mother without any pains? Or should I rush over and slap that homewrecker across the face, telling her to get out of my house?!""

""You—!"" Thaddeus sputtered, veins bulging at his temples.

""Ugh..."" 

Violet suddenly covered her mouth, retching as tears run out of her eyes.

Thaddeus anxiously asked,

""Violet, what's wrong? Are you feeling bad?""

""I'm fine, Thaddeus...""

She trembled as she clutched his sleeve, yet directed her tearful performance at me.

""Selena this is all my fault. I didn't want to stay in your home either, but I truly had nowhere else to go. I—I'll leave as soon as my baby is born, I promise I won't disturb you and Thaddeus anymore.""

As she spoke, she suddenly clutched her stomach, sobbing,

""I'm so sorry, baby. Mommy doesn't want to abandon you, but Mommy did something terrible and must be punished. I'm so sorry...""

Then she began retching violently again, collapsing dramatically into Thaddeus's arms.

Thaddeus looked at me with pure contempt, as if I had committed some unforgivable sin.

""Are you satisfied now?""

I scoffed and walked away without another word.

My attitude completely enraged Thaddeus.

He grabbed a glass from the table and violently threw it directly at me.

A sharp pain exploded at the back of my head as the glass shattered. I collapsed heavily onto the stairs.

The intense pain made me break into an instant cold sweat, leaving me temporarily unable to stand.

""Stop the act! Get up already!"" Thaddeus barked impatiently from behind me.

Violet approached with fake concern:

""Selena,are you alright? I think the glass just grazed your shoulder...""

""Shut up!"" I cut her off through gritted teeth, struggling to my feet.

Seeing my harsh treatment of Violet, Thaddeus's eyes turned icy.

""Violet has no appetite. Go make her that chicken soup you're good at. Remember, no onions—she doesn't like them.""

""No,"" I refused without hesitation.

""That wasn't a request!"" Thaddeus's face darkened menacingly. ""Selena,do you really think you have a another choice here?""

I clenched my fists and looked him straight in the eyes.

""I said no. So what?""

A cold glint flashed in Thaddeus's eyes. He stormed forward, roughly grabbed my arm, and shoved me forcefully into the kitchen.

""Slam!""

The door banged shut behind me.

""You're not coming out until that soup is done!""

""Thaddeus, you've lost your mind!""

I pounded on the door, screaming ""Let me out!"" until my voice was raw, but was met with nothing but silence.

My palms were red, swollen and bu//rning from hitting the door. Finally, I slid down exhausted to the floor, leaning against the cold door.

Through the door, their conversation came through clearly.

Violet spoke in a soft, gentle voice.

""Thaddeus, aren't you being too much to Selena? If she doesn't want to cook,I'm okay  without drinking the soup.""

Thaddeus sighed,

""Violet, she's been spoiled by her family all these years. I need to fix that PRINCESS attitude. If she's going to marry into the Blake family, she needs to obey our rules. Otherwise, how will she properly raise our heir?""

""The Blakes have always valued kindness, but she's too stubborn... My mother has never really liked her.""

Violet asked, confused,

""Thaddeus, why don't you just break up with her then?""

Suddenly, everything went quiet outside.

I held my breath, perfectly still against the door.

Well, if I was so terrible in his eyes, why put up with me at all?

The silence stretched on until Violet carefully prompted, ""Thaddeus?""

His calm voice pierced my heart like a knife:

""The Lockhart family's influence is the best in LA. They've been incredibly helpful to my career over the years...""

I clutched my ch//est tightly, unable to hold back my tears any longer.

So that was it.

All these years, what he valued was the Lockhart name, not me.

In a daze, I remembered when my grandfather had a sudden heart attack. It was Thaddeus who boldly proposed the surgical procedure that saved his life.

I fell for this brilliant young doctor with exceptional skills at the first sight.

I had only sent a text express my gratitude, never expecting him to pursue me so relentlessly afterward.

He never directly asked for my family's help. All those behind-the-scenes arrangements were made by me without his knowledge.

How ridiculous!I had always worried he would refuse if he found out.

The kitchen door opened. Thaddeus visibly startled when he saw me, then frowned

""All this crying over making soup? Get out of my sight. You're annoying!""

Fighting dizziness, I stood up and stumbled toward the bedroom.

The moment I pushed open the door, a chill ran down my spine.

The bedsheets had been changed to the pink lace style I despised.

The photo of me on the nightstand had been replaced with a portrait of an unknown baby.

In the closet, not a single piece of my clothing remained.

Thaddeus's voice came from behind me,

""The guest room is too crowded. Violet needs the master bedroom now, especially with her pregnancy.""

Violet added timidly，

""You don't mind, do you, Selena? Don't worry, once the baby is born, I'll—""

""Fine!"" I cut her off. ""Where are my things?""

Thaddeus looked away,

""The housekeeper moved them to the storage room. The nearest guest room is being converted into a nursery. Choose any other guest room you want.""

After a moment of silence, I nodded ""Okay.""

In the storage room, my designer dresses were carelessly thrown on the floor, jewelry scattered in dirty corners, like unwanted garbage.

I took a deep breath and looked mockingly at Violet as she followed me in,

""So eager, are you? Couldn't even wait for me to leave first?""

A flash of embarrassment crossed her face before she quickly replaced it with an innocent expression,

""What are you talking about, Selena? Thaddeus had the housekeeper put these away. I didn't do anything.""

I laughed coldly, pointing to the footprint on my dress,

""Was this the their work too?""

""So what if it was me?""

She suddenly lowered her voice, a vicious gleam in her eyes, while pretending to back away in fear.

""Please, just let me go, Selena.""

With that, she suddenly cried out and pretended to fall backward.

Thaddeus rushed in just in time to catch her.

Violet immediately clutched her stomach and began sobbing,

""Thaddeus, I didn't do anything, but Selena pushed me... Thank goodness you came, or the baby might have...""

""I didn't push her!"" My throat tightened as I instinctively tried to explain.

A violent glint flared in his eyes as he lunged forward, grabbing my throat and slamming me against the wall.

""You think I'd believe you? You think Violet would use our baby to frame you? When did you become so vicious!""

His grip was terrifyingly strong. I could barely breathe as I struggled to squeeze out a few words.

""I really... didn't...""

""Enough! I don't want to hear your excuses!"" He laughed bitterly, throwing me heavily to the floor. ""Go back to Lockhart Family to be the princess! Don't come back until you realize your mistakes!""

I stumbled to my feet, staring at him in disbelief.

At eleven at night, he was throwing me out?

I remembered how, in the past, he would insist on accompanying me even for a late-night walk.

Now, he stood with his chin raised, not even willing to spare me a glance.

How many times had he mad at me today because of Violet?

No matter what I say or do, it’s always wrong in his eyes.

And today was supposed to be the day we got our marriage license.

I closed my eyes, then left without even taking my clothes, fleeing that suffocating place without looking back.

...

As soon as I returned to  Lockhart Estate, My phone rang.

It was a video from Violet.

I knew I shouldn't open it, but my finger pressed play uncontrolled.

In the video, Thaddeus was tenderly embracing Violet, his eyes closed as he gently kissed her forehead, his face full of contentment and affection.

His voice carried a touch of regret,

""Violet, if I had met you earlier, I would never have been with Selena. You're so talented in medicine, so pure and ambitious. What about her? He relied on Lockhart’s name to get away with everything,loafs around all day.""

""The Blake family has been doctors for generations. If I had really married her, she would have ruined our reputation sooner or later!""

Every word was like a poisoned needle, precisely stabbing my most vulnerable spots.

Violet had easily become his personal student thanks to her family's connections, and he called her his ""little sister"".

That was what he called ""talented.""

Meanwhile, I had given up my family resources, starting from the bottom and working my way up to become investment director at Lockhart Enterprises.

In his eyes, that was ""loafs around all day.""

So in his heart, I was never worth anything.

How could he ever have truly loved me?

I put down my phone, tears soaking my pillow.

The sky was just beginning to lighten,Archer's call came through.

""My dear,sleep well?"" 

His voice couldn't hide his excitement.

""I just landed in Milan. I was so excited I couldn't sleep during the entire flight. I still can't believe you actually married me.""

His tone suddenly softened,

""Wife, I already miss you. How about you?""

Wife?

That word snapped me back to reality.

That's right—yesterday, in my anger, I had gotten my marriage certificate with Archer.

""Wife? Why aren't you saying anything? Are you... having regrets?""

His voice full of wronged.

""No,"" I answered softly.

Archer and I had grown up together. Though I wasn't sure if he truly loved me, at least I knew him well.

The Reynolds family was a suitable match for mine—equals in status and wealth.

There was an audible sigh of relief on the other end of the phone, his energy immediately returning,

""I'm coming back tomorrow! We'll pick out wedding rings! The certificate is legal, but we couldn't skip the proposal or the wedding ceremony as well!""

""Just focus on being the most beautiful bride. Leave everything else to me.""

I couldn't help but smile, agreeing to his plans.

That was Archer.

With him, everything would be taken care of. All I had to do was follow along.

As for Thaddeus...

In my memories, it was always his hurried back walking away. Even getting the marriage certificate was my initiative.

Back then, he had frowned and said""It's only five years. Isn't it a bit be earlier?""

The difference between being loved and not was so clear.

For the entire day, there was no word from Thaddeus.

His mother Mildred, however, couldn't wait to call, her voice dripping with superiority,

""You know about Thaddeus and Violet, right? Now that she's carrying the heir of the Blake family, we absolutely won't let her be treated unfairly. Thaddeus will marry her properly. Thank goodness you two didn't get certificate yesterday!""

""I always said you weren't perfect match. The Lockhart family has been in business for three generations, while the Blakes have been doctors for generations. Our family foundations simply don't match, right?""

I let out a cold laugh:

""Mrs. Blake, Thaddeus and I have broken up. Unless it's important, please don't contact me again.""

There was an obvious pause on the other end of the line. She clearly hadn't expected such a response from someone who had always been so accommodating.

Just as she was about to explode, I decisively ended the call.

She immediately called back several times.

Without hesitation, I blocked her number, then proceeded to block all of Thaddeus's contact information as well.

I deleted all our photos together. Five years of love, gone just like that.

The next day, while selecting wedding rings at a jewelry store, I unexpectedly ran into Thaddeus and Violet.

He was enthusiastically designing an expensive set of jewelry for Violet, along with a traditional protection pendant for their unborn child.

When he saw me trying on rings, Thaddeus's face instantly darkened，

""Selena,I told you to go home for reflection, and here you are buying wedding rings? You think with this sh//it attitude I'd still marry you?""

He roughly grabbed my hand and forcibly removed the ring, handing it back to the staff.

""We won't be buying it, thank you.""

The diamond's edge cut into my finger, and blood immediately welled up.

The staff hurriedly tried to tend to my wound, but Thaddeus coldly stopped her,

""It's just a small cut. Doesn't matter.""

I ignored him.

Wiping away the blood, I said to the staff""Please show me that other ring instead.""

Thaddeus seized my wrist, shouting""Was I not clear enough? You're not buying any rings TODAY!""

Nearby customers began whispering,

""That pregnant woman must be his wife. This mistress is pretty brazen, openly shopping for wedding rings.""

""So shameless. Being a homewrecker and still wanting official status. No wonder the man's yelling at her.""

Seeing this, Violet pretended to mediate,

""Selena,please stop making a scene. It's embarrassing with all these people watching. Why don't I give you the ring Thaddeus just bought me? See if it’s your style?""

The staff also tried to persuade me,

""Ma'am, maybe you should come back another day... We can't really do business with this kind of disturbance.""

Thaddeus's grip tightened, clearly about to drag me out forcibly.

I yanked my hand free,

""Thaddeus, what business is it of yours if I buy a wedding ring? Please mind your own business!""

""None of my business? Fine, I'm officially canceling our engagement. You'll never need a wedding ring now!""

With that, he shoved me hard.

As I stumbled backward about to fall, a pair of hands steadied me firmly.

Archer's voice sounded in my ear,

""Sorry I'm late, wife.""",1,1748339341.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I don't know anything about this woman figure, not her age, how she looks, the dress she wore.......i can only say she was wearing pure white colored clothes. So it's safe to say i was with sam and the female figure was just following me everywhere. I wasn't dependent on this figure, in fact i was the one looking out for her.

I was about to jump over a small stream of water but the other end was a bit far. I can make it if i jump confidently but stopped because I didn't  know the woman figure with me could make the jump so i stopped at the edge. Sam lept over, crossed successfully and kept running. Me and the woman took the long way along the edge and eventualy we crossed.
we found sam at this coffee shop sitting on a bench. That's the last i see him. 

Then i saw a snake approaching us from afar. It was a really big snake. Its hood was rised and spread as it was crawling. We ran upstairs into a commercial building with many businesses and picked the shop at the end. I was looking for a shop with no little to opening/crawl space under their doors. I eventually picked the shop at the end but it has crawl space  under its doors. even though there was shops with doors that had no crawlspace uner their doors i ran and picked the door at the end. May be i was looking for a better option but i ran out of options with the last shop being my only option by then because the snake was coming. So after we entered the shop we closed the door and there was some commotion outside for a few minutes, then it stopped. Curious, i opened the door. Fee people were standing here and there in the corridor looking down, i looked down too. I found big frogs(twice their usual size) that were chomping down pieces of what seems to be the body parts of the snake. There's no snake left to be honest, only small pieces of it scattered on the floor. The frogs were just sitting there chewing. The frogs were in shades of green.

we had a long distance fbw situation going on for over a year. we never entered a commited relationship though, despite the fact that there are (or were…) a bunch of romantic feelings because when it all started, I was going through a break up and he‘d not fully overcome his last break up. it just stayed that way and things were good, but the distance was very difficult for him.

earlier today he told me that he‘s going on a date on thursday, with someone he hadn‘t seen in a long time but randomly texted him recently and they met for a cup of coffee. he said he‘s feeling like a teenager all over again. I asked wether that meant the end of „us“ and he said yes.

so that‘s it. there goes a very special kind of relationship, even though we never used that word for it. there goes a kind of love and connection I haven‘t felt in a long time, not since things with my previous partner started getting difficult. there goes a constant in my life, the daily „good morning“ texts and check ins with each other. there goes some of the best sex I‘ve had in my whole life.

he wants to stay in touch. we‘d been friends for half a decade before this fbw thing started out and while I don‘t want him to vanish out of my life, the pain hits hard rn. I‘m not sure wether I can keep up the contact until I‘ve processed this, even though I don‘t want the daily texts to stop but that‘s probably not all too healthy or helpful with the processing. idk…

rn, I want to either vanish under a pile
of blankets in my bed and cry my eyes out or get so high I forget about everything. but I‘m at work, all alone and with nothing to do that keeps my thoughts occupied enough to distract me.

and ironically enough, I‘ve been trying to figure out the best way to ask him wether he‘d like this unlabelled relationship one that is labelled as such. I guess I don‘t need to spend any further thought on that.",2,1748339125.0,KindVoice,1,1.0,False

1kwj35q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kwj35q/i_need_advice/,I need advice.,"I’ll try to keep this as short and as straight to the point as I can lol.  
  
I recently got back into dating after YEARS of focusing on myself and working through personal stuff. I finally felt emotionally available and ready.

First, I went on a date with someone I really clicked with, but she didn’t live in my city and couldn’t say when she’d be back. We stayed in touch over socials and WhatsApp, became friends, cool.

Shortly after, I went on another date. It wasn’t amazing at first, but she wanted to see me again. We ended up dating for 4 months. The problem was, she didn’t know what she wanted. It turned into a situationship. I fell in love and ignored all the red flags. I met her family, she met mine, her best friends met mine. She even talked about can't waiting for my mother to see her in her wedding dress lol... Either way it was always undefined, and I finally had to draw a line. I said I needed a proper relationship, and that ended things.  
  
I was heartbroken, but after some time focusing on myself again, I was in a good place and ready to date.

Then I started talking to someone new. We vibed online, and it turned out we were going to the same concert. Afterward, we met in person and there was a spark. I messaged her saying I wanted to take her out, she said her shift got cancelled and she’d love to.

She even invited me out to the pub with her sister the night before, but I couldn’t make it (my friend flaked and I had other stuff going on). She was super chill about it. We ended up going out the next day, and the date went really well. At the end, I asked if I could kiss her on the cheek, and she asked if she could do the same, it was sweet, lol, I didn't want to do too much lol.

We both want to see each other again, but she’s busy with work and traveling abroad soon. So we’ll go out again when she’s back.

But here’s where I need advice.

I’m a genuine guy. When I like someone, I give my all. But I’ve been burned before, and I don’t always know how or when to ask the deeper questions. I’m dating because I want a life partner, a family, kids... I’m turning 28 and I don’t want to waste time. I don’t know where she stands on all that, and I’m not sure when or how to bring it up.

Now, while all that was going on, there was another girl I had been chatting to before her. We finally met after my date with the first girl. I didn’t want to say no, after all, I’m not in a relationship and there’s no exclusivity, but I still felt guilty and was conflicted as I have no idea if she's talking to other people.

The date with this second girl went really well too... We connected on a deep level. It was different.. We had coffee, strolled around and even had a music jam session in the park. We talked about our lives, values, and relationships. I naturally was able to bring up that when it comes to dating, I’m dating to marry and that I’m family oriented person and she said she’s on the exact same page. She even said, “Why can’t all men be like you?”

So now I’m left wondering: Is it wrong to be talking to and dating multiple people if nothing has been labeled? Am I being a “fuckboy” without meaning to? Is it okay to explore connections while still figuring out who’s right for me?

I genuinely don’t want to hurt anyone or lead people on, but I also don’t want to pressure/rush people into things they aren't ready for or haven't figured themselves out and I genuinely don't want to waste my time again.

Would appreciate any honest thoughts or advice. I'd also be happy to answer any questions regarding this in detail. Thanks in advance.",2,1748338682.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

But let’s face it, finding the perfect getaway isn’t always easy. We want something more than a simple room with a view.  
In a world of luxury homestays, the significance of a location is as important as the architecture, design and amenities. A well-chosen setting is a backdrop that enhances and defines the overall experience. It is about being in a place that provides relaxation, exclusivity and a deeper connection with nature.  
At Eka Homes, Nandi Hills; we understand that location plays a vital role in crafting an extraordinary experience.

Beginner gardener here, grew some stuff last year but this is my first committed year and taking it week by week really, just looking for some all round advice on care/advice on pruning etc as I'm having a chaotic time.

We started in egg boxes and after many a loss and perhaps neglect after repotting a good few that have survived so far.

We started in containers, poorly filled and planned out, I had some turned over turf I dug up and used after creating a border after a year it decomposed.. I used that mixed with compost and perlite/vermiculite..

We then progressed to the no dig garden bed where we sre 1 week in and the brocolli have been smashed with heavy winds and rain along with slugs..  very sad.. although most in the containers are thriving if not slightly overcrowded if not bolted or having a tantrum. 

Overall I'm happy. 

Thankyou for taking the time to read this. 

I have used a mix of fish and bone in all plants/coffee grounds/weed tea. Over the past few months.

1kwj00s,https://i.redd.it/9e0v6dhgna3f1.jpeg,$ATYR – What’s On This Week: The Fuse Is Lit,"Hey everyone,

Hope you’re all coming back online feeling refreshed. For those in the US, it’s just been a long Memorial Day weekend. For the rest of us, we’ve had a day off from the US markets to breathe. Either way, welcome back—because this is a week you’ll want to be switched on.

First, I want to say thank you again for the overwhelming support on the last two posts: the [$ATYR Development Timeline Super Drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATYR_Alpha/s/uLkxFdyZr4) and the [$ATYR Dealbook Drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATYR_Alpha/s/mZdIiejIvj). The engagement, DMs, thoughtful comments, and sheer energy from the community have been incredible. I honestly didn’t expect it—but it’s meant a lot.

That said, I want to be real with you for a moment.

This kind of research? It’s a lot. I’m just one guy doing all of this manually—digging through filings, building timelines, layering regulatory analysis on top of market structure, then wrapping it in a narrative you can actually use. It’s a grind. I don’t have a team. I don’t have backing. I’m doing things differently because I genuinely believe there’s a better way to analyse biotech setups—and I think $ATYR might be one of the best case studies we’ll see.

At some point, I’d love to share how I actually build these frameworks and how others here can apply them too. But for now, just know: if you’re getting something out of these posts, and you’ve got the means to chip in, it would really help me keep this going. You’re getting what’s effectively institutional-grade analysis, and I’m putting it out there for free. So if you’re in a position to support that work, you can [**Buy Me a Coffee here**](https://buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). It really does make a difference.

Now—let’s get into it. Because in my view, this could be the most consequential week we’ve had yet in the $ATYR story.

---

## What’s On This Week

### Tuesday, May 27 – Piper Sandler Virtual Lung Symposium (2:00pm EDT)

This is aTyr’s first major appearance of the week—and it’s not just any forum. Piper’s Lung Symposium is explicitly targeted at respiratory and ILD-focused investors, with a tightly curated audience that overlaps heavily with specialist biotech desks, healthcare analysts, and institutional funds already tracking interstitial lung disease.

It’s also coming right off the back of ATS 2025, where pulmonology takeaways are still fresh. That means Shukla won’t just be speaking into a vacuum—he’ll be addressing a highly engaged audience looking to identify post-ATS winners.

There’s no webcast, no replay—which is telling in itself. This is a high-trust, closed-door format where nuance matters. The audience isn’t just listening for what’s said. They’re also watching for how it’s said. Tone. Confidence. Word choice. Body language. Delivery. These are the soft signals that institutional investors read very carefully in the run-up to binary events.

In my opinion, this isn’t just investor engagement—it’s the first stage of calibrated exposure. aTyr is stepping into the week with intention. They’re inviting the right folks to the table.

---

### Wednesday, May 28 – Evercore ISI “Diamonds in the Rough” Virtual Event (1:00pm EDT)

This one is big.

Evercore’s “Diamonds in the Rough” isn’t a broad conference—it’s a selective spotlight. The analysts handpick a short list of companies they believe are undervalued and overlooked, typically right before a catalyst that could flip the script.

That $ATYR is slotted here—within 24 hours of Piper, and potentially within hours of the SSC-ILD readout—says a lot. It tells me Evercore sees what we see: that this is a strategically mispriced asset sitting on the cusp of something big.

And the timing is too perfect to ignore. If the SSC-ILD data is released Wednesday morning (a classic move in biotech PR cadence), this could be the first time aTyr management addresses the market post-readout. If the data hasn’t dropped yet, then this is still an exceptionally high-profile placement for a company with zero current sell-side coverage. Either way, the signal is unmistakable.

My read? Evercore knows. And they’re betting their clients will want in—before it becomes obvious to everyone else.

---

### Next Week – Wednesday, June 5 – Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference (2:00pm EDT)

This is the biggest platform of the three—both in audience size and market reach. Jefferies is the institutional centrepiece of the June healthcare calendar. Everyone listens.

If the SSC-ILD readout has landed by then—and I think it will—this becomes aTyr’s first major public stage in a post-data world. The goal here won’t be to repeat the numbers. It’ll be to shape the new narrative:
- What the data means for platform validation
- How it impacts sarcoidosis expectations
- Where efzofitimod fits in a broader immunology landscape
- And whether this is the beginning of a commercial strategy—or an M&A runway

But if the readout hasn’t dropped by June 5 (unlikely, but possible), this becomes an even higher-stakes appearance. It would mean aTyr is walking into the largest healthcare investor event of the quarter with a binary outcome hanging over their head.

Either way, Jefferies is the market-facing capstone of this three-part sequence. It’s where the full story gets broadcast—whether it’s the story of a post-readout rerate or the final calm before the detonation.

---

## Where We Are in the Setup

We’re not early anymore.

We’re now right in the zone where these kinds of setups often start to tip. Not post-catalyst, but not pre-positioning either. I think we’re somewhere in between—nearing the launch window, with everything starting to tighten.

You can feel it if you’ve been tracking closely. The cadence has changed. The visibility is ramping. The behaviour of the company—and the market—is starting to reflect that we’re entering a decision point.

---

### Readout Timing

- aTyr has consistently guided to Q2 2025 for the SSC-ILD Phase 2 readout.
- Between the three upcoming events (Piper, Evercore, Jefferies), the sudden burst in visibility, and the timing norms for releases like this, I think it’s fair to say the drop is imminent.
- Based on all available signals, I believe the most likely readout window is May 28 to June 3, with the highest probability clustering around May 29 to May 31.

From what I’ve seen, it doesn’t look like they’re still finalising the data. I think the company is ready—and what we’re seeing now is a controlled rollout of messaging just ahead of the release.

---

### Short Interest Mechanics

- 11.69 million shares short
- 13.44% of float
- 8.4 days to cover
- ~34% of short volume is happening off-exchange

Despite those numbers, the borrow rate is still only 0.38%. That tells me shorts are relaxed—possibly too relaxed.

This is where I think the risk starts to shift. The structure of this short interest doesn’t reflect the timing or magnitude of what’s coming. If the data is good and momentum builds quickly, there won’t be enough liquidity to absorb the unwind. And that’s when you get the kind of moves that feed on themselves.

This isn’t a typical squeeze setup. It’s more subtle—but no less dangerous for the short side.

---

### Options Structure

- Volatility is spiking hard: Some June and July calls are now pricing in 500%–600%+ implied volatility.
- The skew is sharp—calls are pricing in all the movement. Puts are barely showing up.
- Most open interest sits in long-dated calls—especially Jan 2026. That’s not retail chasing a quick pop. That’s structured positioning for asymmetric upside.

This is what happens when the market thinks something big might be coming, but no one wants to be the first to say it out loud. You see the traces in the vol. You see it in the call walls. And you see the gaps—no hedging, no defence on the downside.

The setup is unbalanced. That doesn’t guarantee anything. But it does mean the path of least resistance is up.

---

## Putting It Together

If you stand back for a second and look at the setup holistically, a few things become clear:
- The data is likely already in hand, or close to it.
- The market is under-positioned.
- There’s clear evidence of quiet institutional accumulation, but no broad attention—yet.
- And the event sequence suggests something deliberate is being timed.

It doesn’t feel like guesswork anymore. It feels like we’re approaching the point of reveal.

---

## Seven Insights About Where We Are Now

### 1. The Conferences This Week Are a Controlled Exposure Strategy

Piper → Evercore → Jefferies isn’t just a media circuit. It’s a sequenced release pattern designed to:
- Surface the company to specific investor cohorts
- Warm the Street to the narrative before the data hits
- Create demand ahead of potential scarcity

This is playbook biotech positioning right before a binary.

---

### 2. Evercore’s “Diamonds in the Rough” Is a High-Conviction Signal

Evercore doesn’t toss around this invite casually. This is their “pre-breakout” list.

To me, it means one of two things:
- They’ve seen enough behind the curtain to believe the data will be good.
- Or they’re positioning ahead of what they know is a story the Street hasn’t priced.

Either way, they’re telling their clients: this one is about to move.

---

### 3. The Options Chain Is Telling a Story of Institutional Positioning

When you see:
- $2.50 and $5.00 call strikes with 500%+ IV
- Deep OI in Jan 2026s
- Virtually no matching put activity

…you’re not seeing retail YOLOs. You’re seeing funds building a call-heavy convexity position. Minimal capital outlay. Massive upside if the trigger hits.

This is a parabolic reflexivity setup in the making.

---

### 4. Short Sellers Are Positioned for Maximum Fragility

Despite the looming binary, the borrow cost is low and short positioning is high. That tells me:
- Shorts aren’t expecting news this week.
- They’re structurally exposed to liquidity risk + FOMO + market maker chase.

If the readout lands clean, this will be an old-school unwind. I believe it could be violent.

---

### 5. Institutional Ownership is Already High—But Still Under-Radar

Over 120 long-only funds hold the name. Names like Janus, Goldman, Schwab, and more. But it’s been quiet accumulation, and coverage remains sparse.

That means we’re in the pre-acknowledgement phase of institutional conviction. Post-readout, if funds begin doubling up, the price discovery could be aggressive and nonlinear.

---

### 6. This Readout Is About More Than SSC-ILD

If the SSC-ILD data is clean, it doesn’t just open that market (systemic sclerosis ILD). It also:
- Validates the NRP2 mechanism beyond sarcoidosis
- Demonstrates broad anti-inflammatory efficacy in autoimmune ILD
- Reinforces the science published in *Science Translational Medicine* in March

It’s not a niche trial. It’s a platform-level de-risking event.

---

### 7. We Are in a Window Where a Clean Readout Could Lead to Acquisition Interest

Between the IP cliff for big pharma, aTyr’s orphan designations, and zero overlapping co-development deals, we’re looking at an M&A target that is:
- Fully owned
- Biogeographically diversified
- Platform-validated
- Regulatory-aligned
- Manufacturing-scaled

If you were Pfizer, AstraZeneca, or Roche, this is when you start calling.

---

## Final Thought

We might be heading into a pivotal week for $ATYR.

The timing, the conference lineup, the market positioning—it’s all starting to align in a way that suggests the SSC-ILD readout could be close. It’s hard to say exactly when, but based on everything we’ve been tracking, it wouldn’t surprise me if something landed in the next few days.

Whether it’s this week or next, we’re clearly in the late-stage setup phase. The signals are converging. The window is tightening. And if the data is good, I think we’ll look back on this as the point where things began to shift.

Just a quick note as well: I’m currently working on a new post that ties it all together. The Development Timeline, the Dealbook, the strategy, the platform signals, the market dynamics—it’s all part of a larger story. I’m aiming to have that piece out later this week or next weekend. It’ll be a synthesis post to help map the full $ATYR picture.

In the meantime, I’ll be tracking the week closely and posting here with anything meaningful. If you’ve found value in these deep dives and want to support more work like this, you can [**Buy Me a Coffee here**](https://buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). It really does help keep these posts coming.

Thanks again for being part of this.

I want to start grinding manually to experience the difference between preground and freshly ground coffee. I will be using moka pot for brewing and I will mostly be consuming milk based coffee. 

Please suggest a manual grinder around 1.5k that suits my requirement for now. I'm hesitant to buy Timemore right now because of the cost as well as I'm not sure if I'll be berwing daily. I am thinking of using this grinder on holidays when I have time.

Also it would be great if you have an idea for time required for grinding (moka pot grind size 10 gram) for the grinder you are suggesting.

Suggestion on getting coffee beans for beginner are also welcome. I'll be buying in Bangalore.

Thanks in advance 🙏

1kwiy61,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1kwiy61/why_your_content_gets_overlooked/,Why your content gets overlooked …,"I’ve noticed recently that a lot of content these days forgets the main purpose of the content itself… to hook the human.

So many people I think still try to ‘hack the algorithm’

It doesn’t matter how smart your targeting is, how high your budget runs, or how advanced your funnel tracking is…if the creative doesn’t grab attention in the first few seconds, you’re already losing.

Not to the algorithm. To the person you failed to hook.

With many clients, I saw this same mistake over and over:

People obsess over technical tweaks and placement optimizations while completely ignoring the part that actually drives the click: the hook.

The truth is, weak hooks are why good ads fail.

And weak hooks usually come from one of three common mistakes:

Trying to be clever instead of clear

Too many marketers chase witty copy or quirky visuals that don’t instantly communicate value. 

It might be “funny,” but if your ideal customer doesn’t know the ad is for them in under 3 seconds, they’re gone.

Speaking to everyone (which means no one)

Broad, generic language like “Struggling with your goals?” or “Tired of the same old routine?” might sound universal, but it lands flat. 

Great hooks are specific. They feel personal. You want the viewer to feel like, “Wait, are they talking to me?”

I also noticed that aloooottt of copy forgets to add any emotion.

People scroll fast. Logic doesn’t stop them. Emotion does. If your hook doesn’t trigger a gut reaction (curiosity, pain, anger, desire, identity) …it’s just wallpaper.

So what makes a great hook?

After analyzing thousands of top-performing creatives, I keep coming back to these 3 elements that show up in nearly every winner:

RELEVANCE – It instantly signals “this is for ME.” The viewer should be able to self-identify in the first second.

EMOTION – It sparks something. Curiosity. Urgency. Frustration. Hope. Fear of missing out. Identity. If it’s flat, it’s forgettable.

SIMPLICITY – It should stop the scroll even on mute. If the visual alone can’t hold attention, you’re relying on the wrong things.

Want to fix underperforming ads fast?
Start with the hook.

Not the headline.
Not the product features.
Not the button color.

Fix the moment where a person decides whether to give you 3 more seconds, or keep scrolling.


Here’s some examples: 

1. Bad Hook: “Struggling to stay productive?”

Better Hook: “Entrepreneurs: Can’t focus for more than 10 minutes? Try this method that helped me 3x my deep work hours in a week.”, without quitting coffee.”

Why it works: Clear audience, relatable problem, measurable outcome, and a believable timeframe.


2. Bad Hook: “Introducing our new skincare formula.”

Better Hook: “Breakouts after 30? 87% of users saw clearer skin in 10 days—with zero hormonal side effects.”

Why it works: Calls out a specific pain, shows results with a stat, and addresses a common concern (side effects).


3. Bad Hook: “Save money with our budgeting app.”

Better Hook: “This free app helped me save $312 in 14 days, without changing what I bought.”

Why it works: Specific dollar amount, timeframe, and emotional hook (“without changing what I bought” = benefit without sacrifice).


4. Bad Hook: “Try our new gym program today.”

Better Hook: “Dads are dropping 10–15 lbs in 28 days without tracking calories. Here’s how.”

Why it works: Speaks to a clear audience, shows a specific result, adds intrigue with “without tracking calories.”


5. Bad Hook: “Meet your new business partner.” (for a software platform)

Better Hook: “This AI tool cut my proposal writing time from 2 hours to 15 minutes, and landed me 3 new clients last month.”

Why it works: Measurable time savings, business outcome (clients), and proof it works.

As most people who have smoked, I have tried to outright quit many many times, eventually failing every time, until I managed to switch over to vaping about 8 years ago and I could tell a definite positive impact on my mucous membranes / cough / etc.

For the past 2-3 years I've been suffering from a lot of various skin ailments: atopic dermatitis, folliculitis and occasionally nummular eczema. I've gone through an absolute ton of various treatment options and only my folliculitis seems to currently be under control, 4 months into a course of isotretinoin.

Getting really desperate with my skin problems with no solutions in sight, I figured doing things that are supposed to improve my overall health should be a big focus in my life. First I started going into weekly sessions of full body red light therapy followed by full body cryotherapy. Then I added going to the gym once a week. Then I quit nicotine entirely first my switching from vape to patches, reducing nicotine strength over time and eventually quitting completely. Then I added walking 10,000 steps per day (which is up from my 3000/day I was doing at that point).

So far, healthy/healthier living seems like a scam and an absolutely massive waste of time.

Red light therapy combined with cryotherapy does have a very noticeable impact on my overall mood and reduce anxiety a lot, so I continue doing them weekly, but they did absolutely nothing at all for my skin.

Weekly gym sessions did make me feel a little bit more flexible and kinda easier to move around in my daily life, but had absolute zero impact on my weight.

Quitting nicotine/vaping did save me some money, but I am feeling absolutely zero positive health benefits (meanwhile, going from cigarettes to vaping was a MASSIVE difference) and I miss how it feels to vape after a few beers or while drinking coffee. And the social aspects.

Walking 10,000 steps/day has seemingly given me a bit more energy and I feel like I sleep better, but again, the main goal which was weight reduction is simply not happening at all.

I don’t really hang out with friends anymore j focused on my goals.

Today, I randomly went to a coffee shop to go through some notes, and I ran into an old friend (M20) from my JEE coaching days. I remember him being this sweet, quiet guy—very respectful and kind. We caught up, and for a second, I thought maybe it’d be nice to reconnect.

But the more he talked, the more my stomach turned.

He’s in a relationship, been with the same girl since coaching, apparently. But things spiraled when he took a drop year, had some kalesh w his parents, and was sent to another state to help with some relative’s club/bar business. And somewhere in that phase, he completely lost himself.

He told me *without even flinching* that he cheated on his girlfriend, slept with multiple women, ghosted them, made fake promises, drank heavily, got into legal trouble, called escorts… the list just went on. He would even describe the caste of girls he slept with, sexualizing them, how he used them, how he left. One of them was how he got a girl in the bar for internship the slept with her multiple times and left her eventually she had to leave her job. That was disgusting. And the way he said it all so casually, so emotionlessly, like it was just normal life stuff, it honestly made me feel unsafe just sitting across from him.

At one point, he straight up said:
""Yeah, I know I’m a narcissist. I want both i toh want to sleep around and still keep my girlfriend. Guilty trip hota hai but I avoid it. I don’t leave footprints. I just fck and leave.""

I didn’t even know how to respond. I just sat there listening. No reassurance, no remorse in his voice, nothing. And in that moment, I knew I never wanted to see him again. And for all his doing he would say that he balance it out by helping poors and praying to God on specific days like ffs.

It j left me thinking Is it just him? Is this something in the environment? Is this how some people really think now? Because my heart honestly breaks for the girl he’s still with. She probably has no idea.

I walked away from that conversation feeling disgusted, violated even, just by how carelessly he spoke about everything.
And the worst part? And I still wonder why would he even tell me all of this. He knows he’s hurting people, and he just… doesn’t care.

Sorry for the long post but had to vent it out here cause i wasn't able to sleep from past few days after this encounter. I only pray things get better for him or idk",4,1748337725.0,TwentiesIndia,5,1.0,False

Being a product manager is cool in theory because you can do the same job in lots of different kinds of industries. The downside is that now that the market is more competitive, companies can be picky and select people with relevant industry experience.

This SUCKS for me because when I graduated uni, I went into a SUPER niche, dry, boring, industry (for me, anyway).

1kwiui0,https://i.redd.it/zskbr5zkla3f1.jpeg,Common visual/observation/data,"Let’s take the above picture as an example of something I want to discuss. 

I saved it because I thought it was a cool setup. I like the overall atmosphere, even though there could be some extra elements like plants and perhaps a fitting painting or picture on the wall. I can see myself sitting there with my laptop, and perhaps I would want a small table next to the chair for coffee or laying down some books. I’m also having some thoughts about making it into a phone free zone, and my laptop would only be able to be used for non work related activities (e.g. research). 

The example above is an example of how through a common observation, we can understand each other’s thought processes, intentions, emotions. 

In turn, someone else might add there thoughts, opinions or recommendations on what I said, and we would totally get it because we are working on the same observation/data. 

I’m thinking a lack of common data, like if I would have just started talking without describing or showing what I have in mind, would disconnect from this mode of common knowledge, where everything is transparent to one another. 

For example, on reddit, but also in real life, many posts start talking about a person’s point of view, opinion, idea,.. but we don’t have the common data to reason on together. And in fact, they often don’t give you the data that has led them to the things they are saying, so you’re left almost feeling manipulated sometimes because someone is trying to tell you something without also giving you the data. 

I think the same feeling of manipulation is present when PDA people are instructed or ordered to do something, but they aren’t communicating data so you would have a reason to do something. 

I think declarative language is related to this - what you are actually doing is communicating data - a concrete experience, observation or description of something that can be a reason to do something.

Currently accepting applications for friends, acquaintances, co-conspirators, or just people who won’t run when I start passionately monologuing about theatre or why I think cheese is the glue that holds society together.

My qualifications:

Can throw people in the air (cheerleading, not randomly... usually).

Go to the gym so I can keep looking like I know what I’m doing at the gym.

Read books like my life depends on it. Fiction, nonfiction, shampoo bottles.

Cook things. Sometimes on purpose.

Music tastes range from “Broadway star” to “what even IS this noise.”


What I’m looking for:

Friends. Real ones. Not “likes your post but never talks to you” friends.

People who will go to coffee shops, the gym, or the theatre with me.

Someone who won’t blink when I ask deep questions like “do crabs think fish are flying?”

Bonus if you send memes. Extra bonus if you send memes and ask how my day was.


So yeah. If you’re also a little weird, a little lonely, and think we could vibe, slide into my DMs like you're stage-diving into friendship. Let’s make being adults slightly less confusing together.

1kwimdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kwimdu/16_years_of_caffeine_addiction_ends_today/,16 Years of Caffeine Addiction Ends Today,"So i am sitting here now (30m) drinking my daily caffeinated drink (Guayusa tea) for the last time. After this one i quit. Tomorrow marks a new beginning. But how did i come to this point. Let me tell you a story.

Lets go back 17 years in time. Me a 13 y/o skinny boy, who loves to play soccer and other sports got his first PC. I was never a game console guy. PC was my platform. I was quickly addicted playing video games, so back then i was already seeking dopamine highs.

Forward a little bit in time. I had a few friends in my neighborhood which also played the same video games like me. Because internet connections where not that good back then we did a lot LAN parties, playing Warcraft 3, CS 1.6 and so on. I think you know, what i will say, yes, we drank of course energy drinks. Through this LAN parties, to stay awake longer and have more ""energy"" as a 14 y/o child. As if the dopamine hits from the video games wasnt enough. Lets boost it with caffeine.

I don't remember every LAN party we had but one did stick to my mind. We were a little bit older 16 or 17 ish. The parents of one of my friend were in the vacation. In Germany we call it ""Sturmfrei"", so no parents are interrupting us. We were 4 people, and one of us had already a driver license. We were driving to the grocery store, buying shit tons of unhealthy stuff, from potato chips, frozen pizzas and Kinder chocolate to you guessed it right, energy drinks. But i am not talking about your average 250ml or 330ml can of redbull. I am talking about 1,5l bottles of shitty cheap energy drink 33mg/100ml caffeine. Ah yes, 6 bottles of them. So we were basically drinking them like water. Playing League Of Legends, listen loud techno music, drinking energy drinks and eating a slice of pizza. But not only for one day, for 72h...

So basically i was skipping the ""normal"" way of being introduced to coffee by your parents. Where it tastes like shit but you get ""used"" to it. Energy drinks taste good and are way more dangerous. If you use it just like a soft drink.

But back to the story. So i was now around 18 years old, i stopped playing soccer, i was tall and skinny, and can basically metabolize anything. Just give me 5000 calories and i will have a six pack. Somehow, maybe its caffeine related??

But i had no muscles, my arms were thin as chinese chop-sticks. So i started my gym journey.

Of course to get the right buzz for the training, you just chug half a liter of monster. Later i got introduced to the so called ""pre-workout booster"". Which is basically energy drinks on steroids. More stimulants, higher amounts of caffeine. Jack 3D like booster. I heard somewhere that there is a upper limit of 400mg caffeine you should not cross. So i was religiously sticking to this. I was taking this kind of booster til i was 25 y/o. Here and there i started to drink a coffee or a mate soft-drink and started partying with vodka energy. With 25 i discovered during the pandemic to Andrew Huberman and the whole self-help, self-development community. A little bit before the pandemic i was also trying some off-the-counter stimulants, going to raves, staying awake all the night and so on. So i was always seeking some form of stimulants.

By watching Andrew Huberman and other self-help content, to ""improve"" and ""optimize"" your health, i started more and more taking supplements. But never questioning my caffeine consume. Huberman is drinking caffeine, so my believe that caffeine is ""good for you"" was still validated.

I don't know when exactly it was, but more and more the dark side of caffeine came to the surface.

1. I had more often moments especially in social situations where i was feeling very anxious, that i was thinking all the time about what others might think of me.
2. I am very good in abstract thinking, finding creative solutions (i studied computer science). But i was sooo fking nervous in public speaking or talking to girls. My hands and feet were always very sweaty, i started to sweat in my face. And thinking then what if other people are seeing this, they think i am nervous, which in the end made me more nervous and sweat even more. A very shitty cycle. I got diagnosed with ""Hyperhidrosis"", so excessive sweating.
3. I often couldnt fall asleep at night, starting to take melatonin. In the morning directly caffeinating to not feel tired.
4. I feel all the time as if i am not in the moment, i am kinda just in my head, thinking about the things i need to get done. If i am in vacation i can't really relax. I have to do things, my projects.
5. ""I have to do things"" but i am procrastinating. What a stupid thing. You can't enjoy the moments of life, thinking about all the stuff which needs to get done. When you have the time to do these things, you start 10000 other projects.
6. Concentrating feels even with caffeine more and more harder.

I then stumbled upon the whole decaf world. Would lurk in this sub for a few months, reading a lot stuff about caffeine, about the withdrawals, about the science and about some experiences of you guys.

So its finally time for me to quit caffeine for good. My goal is to not be dependent anymore on this drug. I don't want that my brain is occupied by the thoughts of ""that i need my caffeine fix now"". So how will i do it?

I already started to switch 10 months ago all my caffeine to guayusa tea. Its similar to yerba mate, but tastes better imo. It has 20mg caffeine per gram of guayusa leaves. I tapered myself down to 100mg caffeine for the last months. Guayusa already improved a lot of things, my sleep, my anxiety, my focus. But i still tend to do other bad habits, like smoking or chewing nicotine gums from time to time. So i think caffeine is boosting all dopaminergic things and therefore your pre-frontal cortex (the part of the brain where you make decisions) is somehow weakened.

I am a little bit worried about the damage i have made on my brain development. Caffeine is said to decrease the blood flow 30-40 %. The brain is most plastic in your childhood til age 25. Then declines gradually as you age. I believe the brain and the body can heal and adapt from over 15 years of heavy caffeine abuse. But i am a bit scared. I already had the feeling that my mood was the last 10 months a little bit worse, lightly depressed, less motivated. I think its a mild form of paws from tapering and switching to guayusa tea.

\# My Game Plan for the Withdrawels

I have watched some YT videos from other people doing it. I could relate a lot of about the report from Alex Becker, if you haven't checked it, i highly recommend. So i basically took off work for a couple of days, with the intention to do nothing productive. I will take my old gaming PC from the basement, install League of Legends and just play mindlessly for the days to distract myself a little bit.

Lets add a little bit of science to it. So by daily drinking caffeine in any shape or form, the brain is adapting to it. Caffeine is binding to the adenosine receptor. Adenosine as you know is a molecule which is a byproduct of ATP (energy) breakdown. The more adenosine is circulating in your brain, the more you feel tired. As caffeine is binding and hijacking these receptors you don't feel as tired but don't have more energy basically. But the brain and body is always adapting to the environment so is just creating more receptors. Which means your are back to square one. The daily caffeine is just bringing you back to baseline, kind of masking the withdrawels.

So in theory to ""shorten"" the withdrawels after that initial 7 days where the caffeine is completely out of system, we need to do things which enhance the brain adaptation. The magic word here is \*\*BDNF\*\*.

\>BDNF (Brain derived nootropic factor) is a protein that plays a crucial role in brain health, particularly in the development and maintenance of neurons. It's involved in neuronal survival, growth, and plasticity, impacting processes like learning, memory, and response to stress.

The logical approach would be here, to stimulate as much BDNF as possible. What activities are triggering the release? I asked some AI and picked things that i will do.

\- Exercise like HIIT, Resistance Training, Running

\- Learning something new / Reading

\- Meditation and Mindfulness

\- Breathwork

\- Sauna

\- Cold Showers

\- Quality Sleep

\- Forest Bathing

\- Intermittent Fasting

\- Avoiding sugars, processed foods

\- Microdosing LSD (Stamets Stack)

I am already doing most of them regularly, but will be more intentional and consistent. I heard some other people saying, caffeine is likely to be a keystone habit. Which means, if you manage to quit, a lot of areas of your live will improve and you will likely to quit other bad habits and add good ones. I am strongely believing in this. Wish me good luck.

TLDR: I was for over 15 years addicted to energy drinks. In the last years more and more problems came up, like anxiety and some form of social anxiety. Procrastination, Scattered speech, Restlessness, problems falling asleep and so one. I tapered from around 400 mg to 100mg in the last months with guayusa tea, and will quit tomorrow. Took some time off from work and will focus the next months on activities which will stimulate the release of BDNF to speeding up the brain adaptation from caffeine to nocaf.

PS: I apologize for my grammar and format as english is not my native language. I could just copy and paste it into and ai to optimize, but i find it not real and human tbh. I hope i could inspire a few of you which are still lurking around here, reading all the posts and want to quit but don't find the right time for it. Good luck all of you.

Have you ever sat there, staring at a blank canvas or screen, wishing you had an army of artists at your disposal? 🤔 Well, you’re in luck, my fellow content creators! The magic of **AI image generation** is here to save our creative souls and turn our wildest ideas into breathtaking visuals. 🌟 

Let's talk about how you can *work smarter, not harder*. Imagine producing stunning images for your blogs, social media, or any project without needing to master Photoshop!

### Why AI Image Generation?

- **Creativity on Steroids**: Need an elephant in a spacesuit? Boom! Done. The possibilities are endless. 
- **Speed**: Instead of hours spent tweaking visuals, AI can whip up something amazing in minutes. 
- **Cost-Effective**: Why hire a graphic designer for every snippet of content when you can harness the power of AI?

### How Does It Work?

In the simplest terms, you provide a **text prompt**, the AI analyzes it, and—*presto*—it generates an image that matches your description. Here’s how YOU can jump on this:

1. **Choose an AI Tool**: Options abound! Tools like DALL-E, MidJourney, or Stable Diffusion are all great choices. 
2. **Craft Your Prompt**: This is where the magic happens. A well-crafted prompt is your golden ticket. 🎫 For example:
   - Instead of “Dog,” try “A happy golden retriever wearing sunglasses on a beach during sunset.”
3. **Tweak and Iterate**: Don’t be afraid to experiment! If the first image isn’t perfect, adjust your prompt and try again.

### The Art of Prompt Writing

A killer image starts with a killer prompt. Here are some tips to take your prompt game to the next level:

- **Be Specific**: The more details, the better. Describe colors, emotions, and styles.
- **Use Besides""**: Instead of saying “A cat”, consider “A fluffy orange cat curled up with a steaming cup of coffee in a cozy café.”
- **Play with Styles**: Want a retro vibe? Add “in a 90s cartoon style.” 

### Example Prompts to Get You Started

- *“A majestic castle on a hill under a starry sky, in the style of a magical fairy tale.”*
- *“A futuristic cityscape with flying cars, vibrant neon lights reflecting on the wet pavement.”*
- *“A cozy winter cabin in the woods, with smoke coming out of the chimney and snow gently falling.”*

Got your creative juices flowing yet? 😜 

### Pitfalls to Avoid

While AI is a fantastic tool, here are a few things to watch out for:

- **Overly Complex Prompts**: Keep it simple. Sometimes less is more!
- **Expecting Perfection**: Don’t forget to embrace the imperfections! Sometimes the unexpected results can spark new ideas.
- **Ignoring Licensing**: Check the usage rights of the images you generate. Just because it’s AI-generated doesn’t mean it’s free to use anywhere!

I am new to this, so... I installed Brita AquaAroma Crema No. 101831 (which according to my supplier are a follow-up filter for ECM 89455 AC100027-00). To my understanding those filters are suitable for the Profitec Go (newest model).

As you can see in the images, I installed the filter how I think this should work.

Included with the filters were those test stripes.

To my surprise, the color of the stripes are just exactly the same in the tank (before the filter) as afterwards when entering the portafilter (yellow color both; picture shows just one stripe but its 2x the same result). My setting in the filter is set to ""B"" as the water hardness is in the mid range.

Isn't this supposed to work differently? Like yellow before and green or something afterwards?

Any experience and advice on this?

I'm trying to improve my english pronunciation and to sound more like a native speaker with an american accent.  
In the past, I lived in the US, but only for a couple of months. There, people told me that I am easy to understand, but that I have a strong accent. Since then I've worked on my accent and would appreciate some objective feedback from some people here.

Every morning, I take a short walk around my neighborhood. The streets are quiet, with the occasional sound of birds chirping or a distant dog barking. I pass by small houses with colorful gardens and friendly neighbors who wave as they water their plants or sip their coffee on the porch.

There's a little bakery on the corner that opens early. The smell of fresh bread and pastries fills the air, and sometimes I stop in for a warm croissant or a cup of tea. Across from the bakery is a small park where children play and older folks sit on benches, chatting about the weather or their families.

As I walk, I notice tiny details—a cracked sidewalk, a forgotten toy, a cat sunbathing on a windowsill. These familiar sights remind me of how much character this place has. Though I’ve lived here for years, I still discover something new now and then.

By the time I return home, the sun is higher, the streets are a bit busier, and the world feels just a little more awake. It’s a simple routine, but it’s one I treasure.",1,1748336497.0,JudgeMyAccent,0,1.0,False

HELLO. I’m Chris. I’m 23. I live in Northamptonshire. I am very bored and mildly feral from lack of social interaction.

Currently accepting applications for friends, acquaintances, co-conspirators, or just people who won’t run when I start passionately monologuing about theatre or why I think cheese is the glue that holds society together.

My qualifications:

Can throw people in the air (cheerleading, not randomly... usually).

Go to the gym so I can keep looking like I know what I’m doing at the gym.

Read books like my life depends on it. Fiction, nonfiction, shampoo bottles.

Cook things. Sometimes on purpose.

Music tastes range from “Broadway star” to “what even IS this noise.”


What I’m looking for:

Friends. Real ones. Not “likes your post but never talks to you” friends.

People who will go to coffee shops, the gym, or the theatre with me.

Someone who won’t blink when I ask deep questions like “do crabs think fish are flying?”

Bonus if you send memes. Extra bonus if you send memes and ask how my day was.


So yeah. If you’re also a little weird, a little lonely, and think we could vibe, slide into my DMs like you're stage-diving into friendship. Let’s make being adults slightly less confusing together.

Your website traffic has exploded overnight - maybe a social media post went viral, or perhaps a major publication picked up your story. Your heart races with excitement, then drops as you realize your site is crawling slower than a snail in molasses. Visitors are bouncing faster than ping-pong balls, and you're watching potential customers slip through your digital fingers.

I've been there, and let me tell you - it's not a fun place to be. That's exactly what happened to me three years ago when one of my client's blog posts got featured on Reddit's front page. Their shared hosting provider couldn't handle the sudden influx of 50,000 visitors in two hours, and the site practically melted down. It was a harsh lesson in the importance of **choosing the right hosting for high-traffic websites**.

# What Actually Constitutes ""High Traffic"" in 2025?

Before we dive into solutions, let's get clear on what we're talking about. High traffic isn't just about monthly page views - that's like judging a river by its annual water flow instead of considering flash floods. The total amount of monthly page hits for a website doesn't give web publishers any information about when the users arrived and what types of server requests they made.

**High traffic scenarios include:**

* **Concurrent users**: 1,000+ simultaneous visitors during peak times
* **Monthly traffic**: 100,000+ page views with significant spikes
* **Resource-intensive content**: Video streaming, large downloads, or interactive applications
* **Database queries**: E-commerce sites with complex product catalogs and user interactions

The real challenge isn't handling steady traffic - it's managing those unpredictable surges that can make or break your online presence.

# Why Your Current Hosting Probably Won't Cut It

Here's something most hosting companies won't tell you upfront: shared hosting can be cost-effective, it is generally not suitable for high-traffic websites due to limited resources and potential performance issues.

Think of shared hosting like living in a college dorm. Sure, it's affordable, but when your roommate decides to throw a party while you're trying to study for finals, things get messy quick. Your website becomes that stressed-out student, trying to function while competing for resources with dozens of other sites on the same server.

# The Hidden Costs of Poor Hosting

When your site goes down or loads slowly, you're not just losing visitors - you're hemorrhaging money:

* **SEO penalties**: Google doesn't like websites that go down frequently, and you'll see your rankings drop
* **Lost conversions**: Every second of delay can reduce conversions by up to 7%
* **Brand reputation**: Nothing screams ""unprofessional"" like a website that crashes under pressure
* **PPC waste**: If you're running paid ads and your landing pages won't load, that's money straight down the drain

# Understanding Your Hosting Options: From Shared to Supercharged

Let's break down your options, from the budget-friendly to the enterprise-level solutions.

# Shared Hosting: The Economy Class Experience

Shared hosting is like flying economy - it'll get you there, but don't expect luxury. Three or four-year hosting plans can have appealingly low prices, but they don't always work out. If you're unhappy with a host, or your site grows and the old plan can't handle the increased traffic, you may have to buy something else early.

**Pros:**

* Rock-bottom pricing ($3-10/month)
* User-friendly control panels
* Good for beginners and low-traffic sites

**Cons:**

* Limited resources shared among many sites
* No control over server configuration
* Performance tanks during traffic spikes

# VPS Hosting: The Sweet Spot for Growing Sites

Virtual Private Server hosting is like having your own apartment instead of sharing a dorm room. VPS hosting provides a balance between cost and performance, making it a popular choice for high-traffic websites.

**Why VPS Works for High Traffic:**

* Dedicated resources that aren't shared with other sites
* Scalability options to handle sudden spikes
* Better performance consistency
* Root access for custom configurations

Hostinger's cheapest shared hosting plan is $1.99 a month on the four-year plan; its cheapest VPS plan is just $2.99, again over four years. The price difference is minimal, but the performance boost is substantial.

# Dedicated Servers: Maximum Power, Maximum Responsibility

Dedicated servers is the ideal choice for high-traffic websites giving maximum control, resources, and performance but come at a higher cost. Think of this as owning your own house - you have complete control, but you're also responsible for everything.

# Cloud Hosting: The Future-Proof Solution

Cloud hosting has revolutionized how we think about scalability. Instead of being locked into fixed resources, you can scale up or down based on actual demand. It's like having a magical apartment that can instantly expand when guests arrive.

# Key Factors That Make or Break High-Traffic Hosting

When evaluating hosting providers, don't just look at the marketing fluff. Here are the technical factors that actually matter:

# Performance Metrics That Count

Look for a hosting service provider with features beyond website hosting. Since these features can improve your website performance, pay special attention to tools like SSL accelerators, load balances, and smart caching.

**Essential performance features:**

* **SSD storage**: At least 3x faster than traditional hard drives
* **HTTP/2 support**: Faster loading for modern browsers
* **Advanced caching**: Server-level caching, not just WordPress plugins
* **CDN integration**: Global content delivery networks

# Scalability Options

Network capacity. Bandwidth is essential for fast-loading websites, and it's one of the main reasons shared hosting plans aren't good if you're getting a lot of traffic.

Look for providers that offer:

* Automatic scaling during traffic spikes
* Easy resource upgrades without downtime
* Load balancing across multiple servers
* Burst capacity for temporary increases

# The Top Contenders: High-Traffic Hosting Providers Compared

Let me break down the hosting providers that consistently deliver when the pressure's on:

|Provider|Starting Price|Best For|Key Strengths|Limitations|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Kinsta**|$35/month|WordPress sites|Google Cloud infrastructure, excellent support|Premium pricing, WordPress-only|
|**Liquid Web**|$199/month|Enterprise sites|Fully managed, heroic support|Expensive for small businesses|
|**CloudWays**|$11/month|Growing businesses|Multi-cloud flexibility, pay-as-you-go|No email hosting included|
|**A2 Hosting**|$1.99/month|Budget-conscious users|Turbo servers, good performance|Can get expensive with add-ons|
|**FastComet**|$2.74/month|Global audience|AMD EPYC processors, daily backups|Limited advanced features|

# Kinsta: The Premium WordPress Powerhouse

Kinsta is often the first name that comes to mind when someone needs to handle a high-traffic website running on WordPress. It's built to handle websites with anywhere from 35,000 visitors a month to over a million.

**What makes Kinsta special:**

* Built on Google Cloud Platform's premium tier
* Automatic scaling during traffic spikes
* Edge caching in 260+ locations worldwide
* White-glove migration service

**The downside?** You'll pay premium prices for premium service, with plans starting at $35/month.

# Liquid Web: Enterprise-Grade Reliability

Liquid Web – Fully Managed High-Traffic Hosting is what you choose when downtime simply isn't an option. They've built their reputation on what they call ""heroic support"" - and honestly, they live up to the hype.

**Perfect for:**

* E-commerce sites during Black Friday
* SaaS applications with paying customers
* High-stakes business websites

# CloudWays: The Smart Choice for Savvy Business Owners

Now, let's talk about the provider that's been quietly revolutionizing the hosting industry: **CloudWays**. I've been recommending CloudWays to clients for the past two years, and here's why it consistently delivers exceptional value.

# What Makes CloudWays Different

Cloudways pricing starts from $14/mo. Affordable cloud hosting plans built on top of DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, and AWS cloud providers. But price is just the beginning - CloudWays acts as a managed layer on top of premium cloud infrastructure.

Think of CloudWays as having a team of expert DevOps engineers managing your servers 24/7, without the enterprise-level price tag. Supercharge your websites with managed hosting trusted by 100,000+ businesses that demand high performance and reliability.

# CloudWays Pricing Breakdown

CloudWays managed cloud hosting starts at $10 per month, using the pay-as-you-go model. It means you don't have to pay anything upfront; first, test CloudWays' hosting performance and then pay your monthly bill.

**DigitalOcean Plans:**

* **DO1GB**: $11/month - 1GB RAM, 25GB storage, 1TB bandwidth
* **DO2GB**: $22/month - 2GB RAM, 50GB storage, 2TB bandwidth
* **DO4GB**: $42/month - 4GB RAM, 80GB storage, 4TB bandwidth

**Vultr High-Frequency Plans:**

* **Vultr HF1GB**: $13/month - 1GB RAM, 32GB storage, 1TB bandwidth
* **Vultr HF2GB**: $26/month - 2GB RAM, 65GB storage, 2TB bandwidth

**Google Cloud Plans (Premium Performance):**

* **GCE1GB**: $37/month - 1GB RAM, 20GB storage, 1TB bandwidth
* **GCE3.75GB**: $71/month - 3.75GB RAM, 20GB storage, 1TB bandwidth

# Why CloudWays Excels for High-Traffic Sites

**1. Multi-Cloud Flexibility** Cloudways simplifies cloud hosting by enabling you to set up your website on five popular cloud servers including DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode, Amazon AWS, and Google Cloud. You're not locked into one provider's infrastructure.

**2. Real-Time Scaling** During traffic spikes, you can instantly upgrade your server resources. I've seen clients handle sudden 10x traffic increases by scaling up in under 5 minutes.

**3. Advanced Performance Stack** Every server you launch is powered by a fully optimized stack with built-in advanced cache and CDN, ensuring peak website performance that drives results.

**4. Developer-Friendly Features**

* SSH access for custom configurations
* Git integration for seamless deployments
* Staging environments for testing
* Automated backups and easy restores

**5. Transparent Pricing** The best thing about Cloudways pricing is the real-time billing which is super useful. You only pay for what you use, with hourly billing that makes scaling cost-effective.

# Real User Experiences with CloudWays

They charge very little for the specifications they give. Better than WP-Engine, and at a lower price. Cloudways pricing structure is absolutely wonderful.

One of my clients, an e-commerce store selling handmade jewelry, migrated from Bluehost to CloudWays after their site crashed during a holiday sale. The difference was night and day - what used to take 4+ seconds to load now loads in under 800ms, even during peak shopping periods.

# Performance Optimization: Making Every Millisecond Count

Great hosting is just the foundation. To truly handle high traffic, you need to optimize every layer of your stack.

# Caching: Your Secret Weapon Against Slow Loading

Most of the hosting in the scalable category offers in-built caching. Now, you need to understand that caching for a content based site vs. caching for a woo-commerce store will be different.

**Types of caching that matter:**

* **Browser caching**: Stores static files on visitor's devices
* **Server-level caching**: Reduces database queries
* **Object caching**: Speeds up

# Kinsta: The Premium WordPress Powerhouse

Kinsta is often the first name that comes to mind when someone needs to handle a high-traffic website running on WordPress. It's built to handle websites with anywhere from 35,000 visitors a month to over a million.

What makes Kinsta special:

* Built on Google Cloud Platform's premium tier
* Automatic scaling during traffic spikes
* Edge caching in 260+ locations worldwide
* White-glove migration service

The downside? You'll pay premium prices for premium service, with plans starting at $35/month.

# Liquid Web: Enterprise-Grade Reliability

Liquid Web – Fully Managed High-Traffic Hosting is what you choose when downtime simply isn't an option. They've built their reputation on what they call ""heroic support"" - and honestly, they live up to the hype.

Perfect for:

* E-commerce sites during Black Friday
* SaaS applications with paying customers
* High-stakes business websites

# CloudWays: The Smart Choice for Savvy Business Owners

Now, let's talk about the provider that's been quietly revolutionizing the hosting industry: CloudWays. I've been recommending CloudWays to clients for the past two years, and here's why it consistently delivers exceptional value.

# What Makes CloudWays Different

Cloudways pricing starts from $14/mo. Affordable cloud hosting plans built on top of DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, and AWS cloud providers. But price is just the beginning - CloudWays acts as a managed layer on top of premium cloud infrastructure.

Think of CloudWays as having a team of expert DevOps engineers managing your servers 24/7, without the enterprise-level price tag. Supercharge your websites with managed hosting trusted by 100,000+ businesses that demand high performance and reliability.

# CloudWays Pricing Breakdown

CloudWays managed cloud hosting starts at $10 per month, using the pay-as-you-go model. It means you don't have to pay anything upfront; first, test CloudWays' hosting performance and then pay your monthly bill.

DigitalOcean Plans:

* DO1GB: $11/month - 1GB RAM, 25GB storage, 1TB bandwidth
* DO2GB: $22/month - 2GB RAM, 50GB storage, 2TB bandwidth
* DO4GB: $42/month - 4GB RAM, 80GB storage, 4TB bandwidth

Vultr High-Frequency Plans:

* Vultr HF1GB: $13/month - 1GB RAM, 32GB storage, 1TB bandwidth
* Vultr HF2GB: $26/month - 2GB RAM, 65GB storage, 2TB bandwidth

Google Cloud Plans (Premium Performance):

* GCE1GB: $37/month - 1GB RAM, 20GB storage, 1TB bandwidth
* GCE3.75GB: $71/month - 3.75GB RAM, 20GB storage, 1TB bandwidth

# Why CloudWays Excels for High-Traffic Sites

1. Multi-Cloud Flexibility Cloudways simplifies cloud hosting by enabling you to set up your website on five popular cloud servers including DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode, Amazon AWS, and Google Cloud. You're not locked into one provider's infrastructure.
2. Real-Time Scaling During traffic spikes, you can instantly upgrade your server resources. I've seen clients handle sudden 10x traffic increases by scaling up in under 5 minutes.
3. Advanced Performance Stack Every server you launch is powered by a fully optimized stack with built-in advanced cache and CDN, ensuring peak website performance that drives results.
4. Developer-Friendly Features

* SSH access for custom configurations
* Git integration for seamless deployments
* Staging environments for testing
* Automated backups and easy restores

1. Transparent Pricing The best thing about Cloudways pricing is the real-time billing which is super useful. You only pay for what you use, with hourly billing that makes scaling cost-effective.

# Real User Experiences with CloudWays

They charge very little for the specifications they give. Better than WP-Engine, and at a lower price. Cloudways pricing structure is absolutely wonderful.

One of my clients, an e-commerce store selling handmade jewelry, migrated from Bluehost to CloudWays after their site crashed during a holiday sale. The difference was night and day - what used to take 4+ seconds to load now loads in under 800ms, even during peak shopping periods.

# Performance Optimization: Making Every Millisecond Count

Great hosting is just the foundation. To truly handle high traffic, you need to optimize every layer of your stack.

# Caching: Your Secret Weapon Against Slow Loading

Most of the hosting in the scalable category offers in-built caching. Now, you need to understand that caching for a content based site vs. caching for a woo-commerce store will be different.

Types of caching that matter:

* Browser caching: Stores static files on visitor's devices
* Server-level caching: Reduces database queries
* Object caching: Speeds up dynamic content generation
* CDN caching: Delivers content from locations closest to users

# Database Optimization: The Unsung Hero

High-traffic WordPress sites may require scalable hosting solutions, managed hosting with load balancing capabilities, or even load-balancing techniques across multiple servers to ensure consistent performance.

Your database is often the bottleneck. Regular optimization includes:

* Cleaning up spam comments and revisions
* Optimizing database tables
* Implementing efficient indexing
* Using read replicas for high-query sites

# Learning from Real-World Disasters (and Successes)

# The Reddit Hug of Death: A Case Study

Remember that client I mentioned earlier? When their article hit Reddit's front page, we learned valuable lessons about traffic spikes. Resource Intensive: While WordPress itself is lightweight, themes and plugins can be resource intensive. High-traffic sites may need to upgrade their hosting plan or choose a more powerful option.

The site went from 1,000 daily visitors to 50,000+ in two hours. Their $5/month shared hosting couldn't handle it, resulting in:

* 6 hours of downtime
* Hundreds of 504 Gateway Timeout errors
* Lost revenue from potential customers who couldn't access the site

After migrating to CloudWays' DigitalOcean plan ($22/month), the same traffic surge was handled effortlessly with sub-2-second load times.

# The Success Story: E-commerce During Black Friday

Another client runs a dropshipping store that sees massive spikes during sales events. Using CloudWays' auto-scaling features, they handled:

* 15x normal traffic during Black Friday
* Zero downtime across the entire weekend
* 340% increase in conversions compared to the previous year on shared hosting

# Common Pitfalls That'll Sink Your Site

# Mistake #1: Ignoring Geographic Distribution

Kamatera provides excellent bandwidth no matter which package you go with. Regardless of your configuration, the connection is capable of 10Gbs, which will pretty much guarantee your network is never a bottleneck. But even with great bandwidth, distance matters.

If your audience is global but your server is only in the US, visitors from Asia will experience slow loading times. Always choose hosting with multiple data center locations.

# Mistake #2: Overlooking Resource Limits

Many hosting providers advertise ""unlimited"" resources, but dig into the fine print and you'll find ""fair usage policies"" that can shut down your site during traffic spikes.

# Mistake #3: Skipping Regular Performance Monitoring

Uptime (the percentage of the day that your website is available) is a key stat for any serious website. Set up monitoring tools to alert you before problems become disasters.

# Planning Your Hosting Budget: The Smart Way to Scale

# Start Small, Scale Smart

Don't fall into the trap of over-provisioning from day one. Cloudways pricing starts at $11/mo while WP Engine starts at $24/mo, Kinsta starts at $35/mo, and WPX starts at $24.99/mo.

Budget-friendly scaling approach:

1. Start: CloudWays DigitalOcean 1GB plan ($11/month)
2. Growth: Upgrade to 2GB when hitting 80% resource usage ($22/month)
3. Scale: Move to Vultr High-Frequency or Google Cloud for premium performance
4. Enterprise: Consider dedicated servers or custom solutions

# Factor in Hidden Costs

Remember to budget for:

* SSL certificates (though many hosts include these free now)
* CDN services for global performance
* Backup solutions beyond basic hosting backups
* Premium support when you need white-glove service

# The Verdict: Your Action Plan for High-Traffic Success

After testing dozens of hosting providers and managing high-traffic sites for clients across various industries, here's my honest recommendation hierarchy:

For WordPress Sites with Serious Traffic:

1. CloudWays (Google Cloud) - Best overall value and performance
2. Kinsta - Premium option if budget isn't a constraint
3. Liquid Web - Enterprise-level requirements

For Budget-Conscious Growing Sites:

1. CloudWays (DigitalOcean) - Unbeatable price-to-performance ratio
2. A2 Hosting (Turbo plans) - Good performance at competitive prices
3. FastComet - Reliable with good global coverage

For E-commerce and Mission-Critical Applications:

1. CloudWays (AWS or Google Cloud) - Scalability and reliability
2. Liquid Web - When downtime costs more than hosting
3. Kinsta - WordPress-specific optimization

# Why CloudWays Stands Out in 2025

Cloudways is trusted by over 840K global businesses. They have a team of 280+ employees which works as your extended team and ensures you face zero hosting hiccups.

What sets CloudWays apart isn't just the technology - it's the philosophy. They've eliminated the complexity of cloud hosting while preserving all the benefits. You get enterprise-grade infrastructure with shared-hosting simplicity.

The pay-as-you-go model means you're never paying for resources you don't use, but you can instantly scale when needed. It's like having a hosting safety net that automatically adjusts to catch you, whether you're falling or flying.

# Taking the Next Step

High-traffic hosting doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. The key is choosing a provider that grows with your success rather than limiting it.

If you're currently struggling with slow loading times, frequent downtime, or worried about handling traffic growth, consider starting with CloudWays' 3-day free trial. Test it with your actual traffic patterns, not just synthetic benchmarks.

Remember, great hosting isn't an expense - it's an investment in your business's growth potential. Every visitor who stays instead of bouncing, every customer who completes their purchase instead of abandoning their cart, and every search engine that ranks your fast-loading site higher makes the right hosting choice pay for itself.

The internet moves fast, and your hosting should too. Don't let poor hosting be the bottleneck that holds back your success.

1kwigfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketing/comments/1kwigfe/the_reason_your_content_gets_overlooked/,The reason your content gets overlooked,"I’ve noticed recently that a lot of content these days forgets the main purpose of the content itself… to hook the human.

So many people I think still try to ‘hack the algorithm’

It doesn’t matter how smart your targeting is, how high your budget runs, or how advanced your funnel tracking is…if the creative doesn’t grab attention in the first few seconds, you’re already losing.

Not to the algorithm. To the person you failed to hook.

With many clients, I saw this same mistake over and over:

People obsess over technical tweaks and placement optimizations while completely ignoring the part that actually drives the click: the hook.

The truth is, weak hooks are why good ads fail.

And weak hooks usually come from one of three common mistakes:

Trying to be clever instead of clear

Too many marketers chase witty copy or quirky visuals that don’t instantly communicate value. 

It might be “funny,” but if your ideal customer doesn’t know the ad is for them in under 3 seconds, they’re gone.

Speaking to everyone (which means no one)

Broad, generic language like “Struggling with your goals?” or “Tired of the same old routine?” might sound universal, but it lands flat. 

Great hooks are specific. They feel personal. You want the viewer to feel like, “Wait, are they talking to me?”

I also noticed that aloooottt of copy forgets to add any emotion.

People scroll fast. Logic doesn’t stop them. Emotion does. If your hook doesn’t trigger a gut reaction (curiosity, pain, anger, desire, identity) …it’s just wallpaper.

So what makes a great hook?

After analyzing thousands of top-performing creatives, I keep coming back to these 3 elements that show up in nearly every winner:

RELEVANCE – It instantly signals “this is for ME.” The viewer should be able to self-identify in the first second.

EMOTION – It sparks something. Curiosity. Urgency. Frustration. Hope. Fear of missing out. Identity. If it’s flat, it’s forgettable.

SIMPLICITY – It should stop the scroll even on mute. If the visual alone can’t hold attention, you’re relying on the wrong things.

Want to fix underperforming ads fast?
Start with the hook.

Not the headline.
Not the product features.
Not the button color.

Fix the moment where a person decides whether to give you 3 more seconds, or keep scrolling.


Here’s some examples: 

1. Bad Hook: “Struggling to stay productive?”

Better Hook: “Entrepreneurs: Can’t focus for more than 10 minutes? Try this method that helped me 3x my deep work hours in a week.”, without quitting coffee.”

Why it works: Clear audience, relatable problem, measurable outcome, and a believable timeframe.


2. Bad Hook: “Introducing our new skincare formula.”

Better Hook: “Breakouts after 30? 87% of users saw clearer skin in 10 days—with zero hormonal side effects.”

Why it works: Calls out a specific pain, shows results with a stat, and addresses a common concern (side effects).


3. Bad Hook: “Save money with our budgeting app.”

Better Hook: “This free app helped me save $312 in 14 days, without changing what I bought.”

Why it works: Specific dollar amount, timeframe, and emotional hook (“without changing what I bought” = benefit without sacrifice).


4. Bad Hook: “Try our new gym program today.”

Better Hook: “Dads are dropping 10–15 lbs in 28 days without tracking calories. Here’s how.”

Why it works: Speaks to a clear audience, shows a specific result, adds intrigue with “without tracking calories.”


5. Bad Hook: “Meet your new business partner.” (for a software platform)

Better Hook: “This AI tool cut my proposal writing time from 2 hours to 15 minutes—and landed me 3 new clients last month.”

Why it works: Measurable time savings, business outcome (clients), and proof it works.

1kwig24,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1kwig24/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748336023.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

It was one of those things I kept tiptoeing around, thinking I'd bring it up 'next time'... But I decided no more procrastinating and just went for it. Turns out, it wasn't as scary as my brain thought it would be. We sat down, had some coffee (because caffeine fixes everything, right?), and just talked. 

I guess I realized that sometimes I build up scenarios in my head that are way more intense than the actual thing. It was hard to break out of that loop of ""what ifs,"" but I'm really glad I did. Not only did it lift a weight off my shoulders, but it also made me feel closer to him. Communication, who knew, right? 🤷‍♀️

1kwic40,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1kwic40/anachronism_in_fantasy/,“Anachronism” in fantasy,"I’m writing a low-fantasy mystery which is very traditional in setting. It feels very late medieval/early renaissance in Europe in terms of technology and lifestyle. However, I am wanting to use a card pub coaster as a plot point — which weren’t invented until the 1880s. I’m not too worried about this for my story, as I think I can just describe it as thick parchment and be done with it. 

It got me wondering though — how do people feel about ‘anachronistic’ technology in fantasy? A clearer example might be a traditional medieval setting but with indoor plumbing. Or with mechanised transport. Is it immersion breaking? Would you think it lazy or avoidant of the author? Should it be explained in some way as part of the world building? Would you prefer the story simply adopt a later setting style? 

I think a successful example of this would be Legends and Lattes; the story features what is clearly a modern coffee machine,  but the writer explains that it’s a gnomish invention and is very rare.",3,1748335560.0,writing,13,1.0,False

1kwi9ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1kwi9ph/i_did_a_30_day_digital_detox_and_realised_ive/,I did a 30 day digital detox and realised I've been addicted to screens since my teens,"Inspired by Cal Newport's digital minimalism, I did a month long digital detox. My screentime habits were awful. I would wake up and scroll immediately. If I was in a queue at a shop I would scroll. I could be talking to my partner and start scrolling. Something needed to change. Here's some of the things I noticed. Posted on r/digitalminimalism but thought it might be interest to people here also

**A lot of it is unconscious.** The reflexive phone grabbing was genuinely disturbing. I would be working away on my laptop and next thing I know my phone is in front of me with a twitter feed open. No conscious thought involved. Or I'd want to tell my girlfriend something and reach for my phone to text her... when she's sitting in the next room. We live together. I could just walk over and talk to her like a normal human. Or I'd find myself endlessly opening slack looking for a dopamine hit.

**Mornings were unreal.** When you're not doomscrolling in bed, it turns out you can get an insane amount done before work. 7:30 wake up, and by 8am I'd showered, shaved, made coffee, done dishes, sorted my budget for the week. When you're constantly held down by your phone it's like wading through mud. Every simple task takes 10x longer.

**It made sports feel very different.** My team had a slew of huge games that month. Normally I'd be online soaking up all the build-up, player stats, conspiracy theories about the ref's family history, etc. Or if there was a controversial ref decision and I couldn't check reddit or twitter to see if people agreed with me. That urge to validate my reactions through the internet was stronger than I expected. It was genuinely tough. But I found myself talking to colleagues, friends and family about games a lot more to compensate. And if we lost I just got over the game normally, instead of stewing on social media.

**Work performance went through the roof**. My job is target-based and I absolutely smashed my numbers. Turns out when you're not constantly switching from Twitter to TikTok to Youtube you can actually do your job well. But on the flip side I also realised how mind-numbingly boring my job is without podcasts and social media to get me through it.

**Sleep became incredible.** Asleep by 11, up at 7:30 most days. My brain was running at such a slower pace settling down for bed at 10 just felt natural. I'd read a few pages and fall asleep within about 15 mins.

**Started reading more.** I read about 3 books in a month. I normally read but when I had proper downtime or wanted to enjoy a weekend morning, I'd read with a cup of coffee or tea.

**Appreciated Music again.** I'd mostly stopped listening to music during the detox, and the last day of the month I went to a live concert. Once I stopped constantly listening to music all day everyday, I came to appreciate it again. Beforehand I would be constantly shuffling between my spotify playlists never satisfied.

**Tried random hobbies** one weekend I noticed by kitchen knife was really blunt. I walked to a cooking shop and bought. whetstone. I watched two YouTube tutorials on how to use it, then spent hours sharpening my knife. Reminded me how fun learning random little skills can be and how the internet should aid that not take you away from it.

**Present with people.** Conversations with my girlfriend felt more present. Because I wasn't being so stimulated all the time, I remembered that conversations with human beings are supposed to be stimulating in themselves. The weekends weirdly felt longer. Like time was more of a blank canvas for me to add things to rather than something that just passed by on autopilot.

**Started feeling out of the loop with humour.** So much humor with friends and colleagues is based around current reels and TikToks. They'd be making jokes all day that would go straight over my head. A week prior to my detox I'd be getting it. One week later I'm lost. Crazy how quickly it moves.

**It's not a cure all.** it takes things away but doesn't automatically fill the void. I had to actively push myself the following month to sign up for sports classes and actually prioritize leisure time with active pursuits like I wanted to do during my detox. The detox creates space and allows you to take stock of your situation and reprioritise, but you still have to choose what to put in it.

**I feel like a calmer, more normal human.** And you really notice other people's phone habits now. The constant checking, the mid-conversation scrolling. It's everywhere once you step outside it.

**It gets boring then it gets fun.** To give an example, before I could never commit to a Netflix series. Or when selecting a film to watch with my partner I had to make sure it was super highly rated or my attention span wouldn't let met sit still. A few days into the detox I could sit through an entire 1 hour episode with my partner and want to watch the next episode (one of my rules was I was allowed to watch Netflix provided it was with my partner after work and not mindlessly on my own). It was the same with films, even films that aren't great are still stimulating. By making day to day life less stimulating you open yourself up the things you previously thought were boring. It's like quitting sugar then realising how sweet cherrys and apples can be.

**A Month Later.** I still haven't touched Twitter, TikTok, or Instagram reels specifically. There is some trepidation there that if I go back I will slip back. I realised that they aren't that fun compared to real life and it's not how I want to spend my time. But at the same time I know they could suck me back in. I still think there could be value in maybe having one day a week where you use those platforms like Cal Newport suggests. Candidly I have discovered great music, places to visit, places to eat, and picked up new interests through those platforms so I know there's value there, but I still need to work out how I'll go about it.

**Big picture takeaway and regrets.** After the detox I did feel a tinge of sadness. I enjoyed it so much. But I realised properly that I had been addicted to the internet and my phone since I was a teenager. Not just in a ""oh I use my phone a lot"" way but in a compulsive and unconscious way. I thought back to my life. The skills I could have learnt, places I could have gone to, experiences I could have had. I did an extremely interesting degree and a great university, but I never really engaged with the material. The whole time I've had access to much easier and exciting hits of dopamine.

Overall, I felt quite dumb. I'd always saw myself as quite a switched on guy but the realisation that I spent such a huge amount of my limited time on earth staring at a screen because tech companies got me with a simple chemical trick was disheartening. I thought of smoking addicts in the 1950s or fast food addicts in recent times, and realised I was no different. The environment was designed in such a way that my basic operating system was overloaded and didn't have a chance. I'm in my late 20s and I think lots of people my age probably feel similar. We came of age at a time where tech hit such a zenith but there was no precedence in place to know how to deal with it and we were caught hook line and sinker. I think that was the main value of the detox, to take a step back and divorce yourself from the system as much as possible and see it for what it is.

**TL;DR: Did a month-long digital detox inspired by Cal Newport. Discovered my phone habits were genuinely addictive and unconscious - I'd reflexively grab my phone mid-conversation or text my girlfriend when she was in the next room. Results: Morning productivity skyrocketed, work performance through the roof, sleep became incredible, started reading 3 books/month, conversations felt more present. Downsides: Felt out of the loop with friends' meme references, realised how boring my job actually is without distractions. A month later, still too anxious to touch Twitter/TikTok/Instagram reels. Biggest realization: I've been genuinely addicted since my teens and feel sad about all the lost potential and skills I could've learned, experiences I missed while staring at screens. The detox creates space but you have to actively choose what to fill it with. Overall feel like a calmer, more normal human who can actually appreciate simple pleasures again.**",27,1748335259.0,nosurf,3,1.0,False

&nbsp;
 
TL;DR I'm putting this at the top because I know this is long. At the end of March my wife was in the hospital for about a week and a half, but sent home and improving. In the middle of April she was back in the hospital for abdominal pain. A few days later she was in a coma. A few days after that she passed away. This was entirely avoidable, and I want anyone who reads this to understand what they could be doing to themselves. She was only 36 years old.

 &nbsp;

Please forgive me for formatting cause I'm on mobile. 

 &nbsp;

I want to share with you a cautionary tale about how quickly things can go off the rails. This is for all of you, but my hope is that it resonates with people like myself - the ones who think there's still time, the ones who are always waiting for that one thing or moment when reality will hit you and you'll change what you're doing.

 &nbsp;

I've been lurking on this sub for years because I've wanted to quit myself. Day to day my responsibilities were handled without alcohol, but fun events that we were supposed to do together often got ruined by our drinking habits. We'd wake up too hungover to do what we'd planned, or we'd drink too much on a vacation to remember much of it or even worse, we'd have a drunken argument about something that didn't matter and it would ruin the moment. 

 &nbsp;

As for my wife, her drinking seriously accelerated when her youngest sibling died of suicide, a little over three years ago. On my own days off I would do chores around the house and errands that we needed to get done. Unknown to me was that on my wife's days off, she was drinking (not every day off, but at this point it was about every other day off). I remember when I'd get home from work and she was completely coherent and we would be a drink or two in when I'd wonder how she seemed to get drunk so fast. Maybe I was being blind, I don't know. I only figured out she was drinking on her days off when I started finding empty wine bottles stashed in places she thought I wouldn't find them. 

 &nbsp;

During these past few years she also was still handling certain responsibilities without fail. She handled our budgeting and paying our bills, did very well for herself at her profession, and on the days away from work that she wasn't day drunk she was handling things that needed to be handled. On that last point though, one day off from work that she would do what we needed was enough for me to forget the last three or four times that she didn't do anything except drink. That was probably a failure on my part, but our good times were always so great and we were really good at letting go of bad feelings and forgiving each other.

 &nbsp;

By 2024 it was just a revolving door of everything above. One day we were talking on the phone during my lunch break and we'd decided that we were going to have pizza for dinner (one of those frozen ones). I got home from work that night and could immediately smell something burning. When I got to the kitchen I saw the oven was on and when I opened it there was a burnt to a crisp pizza. I took it out and turned the oven off and then went upstairs to the bedroom, where she was passed out on the bed. I changed out of my work clothes and that was about the time she woke up, completely unaware of the pizza for a few moments until she smelled the burnt smell. 

 &nbsp;

That's just one story of so so many. I'd be so upset about things like this that I'd demand we stop drinking immediately and because she felt bad about whatever had happened she'd always agree, and it would last maybe two or three days before it was back to the usual. 

 &nbsp;

This is all a lot of lead up to what eventually happened, but I hope it can illustrate how probably a lot of us feel about drinking and alcoholism at a relatively young age. ""There's time to stop,"" ""I'm young enough to move on from this... eventually,"" and everything else we tell ourselves (me included, I'm no hypocrite.)

 &nbsp;

This year 2025, January 28th my wife woke up to get ready for work after I'd already left. It was the anniversary of the loss of her sibling, which she never really got over. She decided to take a shot before she left and that one shot unfortunately cost her the job that she loved so much. It threw us into a bit of a tailspin financially, but it wasn't enough for her to stop drinking and being home everyday increased the alcohol intake. 

 &nbsp;

During the next couple of months she applied to a lot of jobs but mostly wouldn't get out of bed for much else. I know what it's like to feel the devastation of losing what you think is your perfect job and that's what I thought was happening. What neither of us knew is that her body was breaking down. I could go much further into detail about that, but for now I won't simply because at the time, the signs weren't really clear when we didn't know what we were even supposed to notice.

 &nbsp;

At the end of March 2025, I took my wife to the ER. She was badly constipated and having abdominal pain. She was admitted and stayed in the hospital for 10 days. During that stay she was confused about a lot of things and not herself. At one point she called me at work to tell me about something she thought was going on at our home and got upset with me when I told her she was at the hospital and not home. She insisted she was home and I should believe her.

 &nbsp;

Her doctors explained to me that she was in the beginning stages of liver failure, but because of her age and because there was no scarring on her liver she would be fine... if she stopped drinking. When they told me that, in front of her, she was too incoherent to understand what they'd said. As the last doctor walked out of the room she said to me ""I didn't even hear what he said"" and laughed - and me, not knowing any better I chalked that up to pain meds.

 &nbsp;

By the end of her hospital stay, she was improving. She was no longer having delusions and she was feeling much better. I took her home from the hospital and the very first thing she did when she got home was start drinking again. I told her that the doctors said she needed to stop and her reply was ""they said I need to cut down."" Despite her continuing to drink she showed improvement for a few days. 

 &nbsp;

About mid-way through April things got significantly worse, physically speaking. On April 16th I demanded that if I got home from work the next day and there was no improvement I would be taking her back to the hospital. Stubborn as always, she said ""You know I won't go."" The next morning before I got up for work she asked me to take her to the ER because her abdominal pain was so severe. 

 &nbsp;

Here's where things go so quickly. It was about 9am when I brought her to the ER. I left the hospital at about 8pm. During those 11 hours she went from coherent to not so much, and again I thought it was just pain meds. On this day, when she still seemed in her right mind, one of the last things she said to me was ""I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you."" The situation didn't feel serious, to me it was more like fine, she'll get some treatment and be home in no time. So her apology at the time seemed unwarranted because I didn't think she had anything to be sorry for. Just another thing we'd navigate through and get past. 

 &nbsp;

I went to work the next morning because I didn't know... anything really. It all seemed so routine. After work when I went to see her she was able to identify me, and answer all the other questions they ask in a hospital to make sure you're mentally okay. The one exception is that she was having trouble answering her birthday and the current year. When the nurse asked her birthday she'd get through the month, day and then half of the year before trailing off. When the nurse would ask her birth year again she would laugh and say ""sorry, 2025."" This went on for a minute before she said her whole birthday. I went home that night again feeling like it was just painkillers doing what they do.

 &nbsp;

The next day I didn't have to work, so I went to see her pretty early. She was awake but absolutely out of it. This was the day that one of her oncologists told me that her liver had failed and she had approximately three to six months to live in her current state. That if she stopped drinking and managed to live a full six months she could be a candidate for a liver transplant, and that her kidneys were only working at 30%. She wasn't able to hold her arms up and her fingers couldn't hold on to anything. She spilled coffee on herself, she spilled one of her liquid meds on herself and by this time the nurses were hand feeding her. 

 &nbsp;

The day after this I arrived back at the hospital just in time to see them wheeling her out of her room. I followed behind as they were taking her to the ICU, and once there they explained that she'd fallen into a coma and her life expectancy was less than a month. At times it appeared that she was looking at me but there was no verbal or physical response. 

 &nbsp;

It just got quickly worse. The next day her life expectancy was one to two weeks. The day after it was a week or less. A couple days later and she had passed away, on April 26th, just two days before our 12th wedding anniversary. She was only 36 years old.

 &nbsp;

Her death was due to acute liver failure. For those of you who are around our ages, her 36 and me 42, please understand that you don't know how much time you have left to fix this. Acute liver failure can happen seemingly overnight. 

 &nbsp;

One thing that will always bother me about all of this is something my wife said to me so many times: ""we can't just stop, I'm scared that we'll have a stroke or something if we just quit"" and in the end, it turns out my response to that was right: ""if this continues one of us will die anyway so why not try to just quit?""

 &nbsp;

I know something about that sounds wrong... in what way I cant identify at the moment.  Cliche? Easier said than done? I don't know. All I can tell you is that I've lost my best friend and the love of my life, and I truly feel like if she knew what the end of this was maybe something would be different now.

 &nbsp;

We just couldn't see it coming.

 &nbsp;

PS: I hope this is not breaking rule 9 of the guidelines. Even though it is about someone else's drinking essentially, it also is about that I drank along with her and never saw a stop sign before the eventual crash.",221,1748335179.0,stopdrinking,43,0.97,False

A few years ago, I (35F at the time) was going on a road trip for a week, to take my family to some of my childhood family vacation spots. This was also partially a birthday getaway since it was the day after my husband's birthday. I'd already made arrangements with family & friends to come take care of our pets. I happened to be hanging out with a ""friend"" (40F) who we'll call P. P was telling me all these horrible things about her soon to be ex, D (which I have since discovered were all lies). I decided to offer for P to housesit instead so she could have some time alone to decompress & figure things out. P jumped on the offer saying, ""Yes, yes, YES! You don't have to sell it. Yes!"" This is a ""friend"" I considered like family for almost 8 years; I never would have thought she would do any of this to my family.

The night before we left, I took P to the store to buy her $100 in groceries so she would have stuff she'd like to eat at the house for the week. She picked a bunch of junk food and huge bottle of coffee creamer.

We did all our laundry, cleaned up (well, as much as we could considering we are still packed up from our home renovation & bringing 3 other households into our home from family members that had passed away over the last 2 years. One was 3 months prior to our trip who I gave P anything she wanted from that household before the estate sale), we left no dirty dishes, changed all the automatic litter boxes to new litter & emptied litter bins, washed & remade all bedding so we would come home to clean beds, etc.

All I asked is for the pets to be fed at the normal time & dogs walked a couple times a day. No different than any other time P/anyone has taken care of the animals, except this time it's more convenient since P is staying over rather than having to drive over 3-4 times a day. The only rules we have (for anyone staying at my house) are:
1) DO NOT have anyone over
2) No one stays the night with you at all, no exceptions
3) Please clean up after yourself (leave the house as it was when we left)
4) Ask us first IF anyone NEEDS to come over
5) Only use my vehicle for emergencies or ask if you NEED to go somewhere

Well, just before we left P asked, ""do you have cameras in the house?"" To which I replied, ""No, not really"". I do but not to spy on people, it's only for security & my kids safety. She then said, ""Oh good, I'm going to be going naked in the house & didn't want to be watched"". That should have set off my red flag radar big time. But I let it go (I know, dumb). Let me also state that P is a bigger pear shaped girl with a Miss Frizzle style (not hating, just trying to draw a picture).

IMPORTANT INFO:
Our whole house is automated. I have cameras outside, my garage alerts whenever it operates, I know what lights/appliances are on/used, I even know the amount of power being used. Our neighbor also watches our house like a hawk, & contacts us for anything amiss. Apparently P forgot all this & decided to make our home her free for all open house.

As soon as we left, she left, in my vehicle. Not even 12 hours after we left, P opened my garage. I got the alert which I shrugged off as she forgot something in the car and didn't want to set off the front door camera. I then got a text from my neighbor at 6am asking who's car was at our house with a picture. P used the garage so we wouldn't see the guy she was letting into our house at 3:30am. I texted her about it after she refused to answer calls. P finally replied 4 hours later.

P changed her story 3 times; first it was someone just bringing something to her, second it was a military friend of a mutual friend that happened to be in town, then it was they were just hanging out watching TV because she needed someone since she got lonely that first night. I told her I wasn't happy, that she had broken the rules, violated my trust, I wanted the other person out of my house (my husband was irate at this point). She didn't make them leave for another 4 hours, until after 2pm, to which she also left, in my vehicle. I should have kicked her out right then. I didn't, I'm an idiot who was still trying to help a ""friend"" who ""had no where else to stay"".

**Mind you, I contacted the mutual friend, L, that P claimed knew the guy. L said they knew nothing (I found out after we got home that the guy was a stranger P met to hook up with in my house, and wasn't the only one! P also contacted L prior, telling L to lie to me if I asked about the guy).**

After that happened, P apologized but played the victim card & then asked if D could come over so they could discuss how to tell their teen, J, about the divorce. I agreed so they could have privacy instead of in front of J or at a coffee shop (this was the only time P asked if anyone could come over).

P used my vehicle every day, put over 200 miles on it, left it on E, and left it unlocked when I kicked her out the day before we came home. Several times were to go meet for hook ups. P would also drive around & park for hours just contacting people with it running. P also got high illegally & then drove my vehicle back to my house after 4 hours of running the roads for hook-ups until 1:30am (I know all this because I have a dash camera. Apparently P didn't realize it records audio too). P, or J, broke the clip that holds the visor; securing screw was gone & it was an inch long, so it doesn't just fall out.

**This vehicle is extremely special to me as it belonged to my late father & is one of the last things I have of him that makes me feel like he is with me. I can still look over in the other seat & picture him there talking with me. I can go into the settings & still hear his voice recording when he setup his phone. P knows all of this, how special my dad is to me. She was there with me the night my dad passed. So if this vehicle were to get damaged or totaled due to P's negligence, I'd be certifiable.**

P then had J brought over without asking permission. If P had asked, I would have said ""No, use the car to go see J."" I'm not going to deny P seeing J, I just don't want J in my house; we don't trust J (mainly because J is incompetent compared to others that age... at 12 years old J washed their Nintendo Switch in the kitchen sink & almost caught their house on fire by putting a dry Ramen cup soup in the microwave; among many other reasons). Our reasons were justified during this incident.

P left J, unattended, in our house for an hour which I found out was to go have phone s*x in a public parking lot down the way (in a not so good part of town), in my vehicle. P finished that conversation & left my car running & unlocked to go in a vape shop for over 30 mins. J also stayed the night, without P asking for permission even though P knows we said no one stays over at all; ESPECIALLY after the first night having a stranger in our house. 

While there, J destroyed my kids room, that had been cleaned up before we left, tore their beds apart, left food in the room, destroyed some lego builds my kids had on display, etc. There was stuck/melted gummies in one bed all the way through to the mattress cover. J also pulled the protective plastic off my instaview refrigerator door, same door is off kilter, & the instaview light goes on/off randomly now (was not like this the day we left). There was food under the couch in the living room. Black marker marks on my kid's bed frame and on boxes randomly in the house. My nintendo switch had the joy-cons taken off, messed with, & my Pro controller was not where it belonged (this bothers me a lot since J washed/ruined theirs). All the rooms in my house had the doors open, our master room had been rifled through & stuff used (my brand new spray deodorant was on the floor, open, empty, & had stuff all over the nozzle), and space where our safes & jewelry are was also open & had been gone through (this made my husband so mad).

When I saw that J had stayed the night, I texted P about it and told them to leave my house & car keys, that I would find someone else to take care of the pets the last 24 hours. P lost her shit on me and said they had no where to go & would have to ask to stay at D's place. Direct quotes from texts:

""He's my son. You can't deny me seeing my son.""
""I don’t think that you’re taking into account my feelings at all, and what I’m going through. I almost killed myself yesterday.""
""Do you know how many meds you have in your cabinet that I could have used to do it.""
""I was so fucking low and couldn’t think of any reason why not""
""If I wasn’t going to have autonomy, then I wouldn’t have agreed""
""I knew that it would be fine, and that he would help me a whole lot. I knew nothing bad would happen, and that if anything did, it would be my responsibility. Therefore, I didn’t ask can my kid stay with me for a few hours.""
""I’m not arguing I’m just telling you that it’s really fucked up how you’re acting, as if I did something horrible, when I literally had an extension of myself that helped me get through some of the darkest times of my life""

Side note: These are all texts after she left J unattended for an hour to have phone s*x in a parking lot, I found out that she also ignored J telling him to go away & leave her alone because she was on the phone. So I don't believe the pity party BS.

I specifically told P to lock everything up and leave through the garage. None was done & thankfully my contractor showed up an hour after she left. My contractor (I trust like family) overheard me asking my mom & offered to take over. He went through the house, sending photos so I knew what to expect. Needless to say my ""vacation"" was not one for me as the whole time I was stressed out because of all the things P was doing. I also got P gifts from the places we visited even after the 1st night as a thank you, and would call/text asking what she'd like. P greedily told me what she wanted while knowing all the crap she was doing wrong. P did not receive anything.

When I got home to find a sink full of dishes, drinks left all over my house (even on my laundry washer by the dispensers), a load of laundry/towels, all bedding needed to be rewashed (completely defeating what I had done before our trip), food all over the floor (that my husband had to immediately vacuum everywhere), all the other above mentioned things & more; I started shaking & crying I was so upset. All this before we could unload our vehicle.

I called a mutual friend (57F), A, that is like a bonus mama to me (who was going to help take care of the pets in the original plan), that came over immediately and was shocked to see how P left my house.

When I texted P ""We need to talk"" because she wouldn't answer calls. P immediately did the victim card (saying ""However I cannot hear the things right now. If you ever cared for me and want me to get better... wait to show me... I almost k*lled myself last night"") & said she couldn't handle it right then. So I abliged P and called D (the father of J, who damaged my property) to discuss only the things about J, not what P had done. Apparently that was a ""low blow"" & I'm ""f*cked up"" & expected her to be my ""servant"".

D made P call me. When confronted with only a few things & being told ""I love you dearly but I don't think we can be friends after this. You broke my trust by everything you've done"", she screamed over the phone ""What all did I do that is so bad? I did a good f*cking job! I'm not going to be ridiculed! I did a good f*cking job! I stayed on him (J) not to get into stuff (not sure how when she left J unattended & ignored him repeatedly). All those things are fixable! I did a good f*cking job!"" & then hung up on me. P then texted A that I could ""sue for the damages"", that she ""doesn't care nor would bring herself to care"", that she was blocking A & going to have A arrested for harassment if A sent one more text all because A wasn't supporting P on all this.

So much has been discovered since. My mind is completely blown... I cannot wrap my mind around how anyone could do these things and then also to play like they are the victim & make it the homeowners fault, let alone someone that is a friend.

UPDATE: I have been informed that P has talked crap about me for our entire ""friendship"", manipulated others into thinking I'm this awful person, & when asked why P continued to hang out with me if I'm so horrible... P said, ""because she pays for everything & gives me stuff all the time."" P still continues to talk bad about me years later. This hurt so bad to hear as P literally knew me better than anyone; knew perfect gifts I'd like, places I'd like to go to, we were always together at least 4-5 days a week, knew my food tolerances, etc. I couldn't know someone that well if I didn't like them.

So, am I the asshole for kicking her out? For contacting our friends she used in lies? For contacting D about damages? For wanting to discuss things when I got home & not when P decided she was ""ready in a few days""?

Also... a little background on how I housesit. I was asked to watch P's house for a month over Xmas & New Years when I was living in a camper during demo & renovation. P said we could go over, hang out, cook meals, etc. I never took anyone else with me to check on their house 3-4x per week. I cleaned the full sink & counter of dirty dishes they left, took out the over flowing garbage they left, cleaned out all the rotted food & anything perishable in their fridge, I took out the fridge parts & clean all of it inside, I washed all their bedding (which were not made) & remade them so they would have fresh beds when they got home, did all the laundry that was scattered all over the house, and so much more. I even told their landlord that I made the mess in the house, while cleaning, when he came to get their rent check & change the AC filter. He liked me & told me ""I know that's a lie, and they will just destroy all you've done within a week"".

I also housesat for L. She told me I could make myself at home. I slept on her couch so I didn't mess up anything. I also didn't bring anyone over to her house or eat her food. I even followed her recycling on trash.

I don't expect that level of housesitting but I do expect my house not to become a brothel or property to be damaged.",6,1748335085.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,7,1.0,False

 I have 3 sisters, I am the middle child I have autism, I have one older and one younger sister about ruffly 3 years apart between all of us.

We were raised in the country , both my mother and my father have extreme mental health issues and NPD traits. 

My father :

was taken from his birth mother, (a teenager mother ) 
(in Australia they used to take away women’s babies, that we not married ) 

He was eventually adopted at 1 years old, eventually my adoptive grandparents told him he was adopted when he was 18.

He is extremely patriarchal, hunter and has zero respect for women.

he is also codependent, as a parent he was hardly ever loving, mostly just screamed at us, made us work until night time,doing filthy, dangerous jobs.

he would get excited to hit my older sister with a broom stick,very hard leaving large welts, every time he thought she deserved it.

I would also get hit but less often then my older sister, my younger sister was never hit. 
————————————————————————
My mum:

My mothers mum (aka my Nan), had her first born when she was 16 and her baby was stolen from her by evil nuns and the government, she eventually met my bio grandfather and had 3 children, my mothers is the middle child. 

My mother was SAed as a child by her father from the age of 3 onwards.

My Nan instead of leaving just became a drunk and ignored my mother’s suffering.

flash forward to my mums teenage years, she meets my dad and she goes to spend time with him at my dads family’s home, 

My mother’s father punches my mother in the face for wanting to visit my dad, her teenage boyfriend. 

My mother is a very submissive to my father’s very very poor treatment of her but a cunning woman,an enabler,also very codependent, she like my father seems to enjoy other people suffering. 

My siblings and my own home life:

My mother and father were extremely cruel to my older sister, hurting her physically and emotionally daily, devaluing her and exploiting her for more intensive labour daily, she was not allowed to even enjoy the same things as the rest of the family, denied even a tiny bit of joy daily. 

I would also cop similar treatment but my sister took the grunt of the pain and labour. 

My younger sister experiencing even less than I and never hit. 
————————————————————————

I (female 30ish) have a best friend (female 30ish)named Lilly, we have been close friends for 10 years. I first meet Lilly when she is in year 10 and I am in year 8, it was just a passing hello.

she was in the same friend circle as a friend of my friend group, our groups tho usually didn’t come into contact because they were much older in year level. 

( My backstory) 
My older sister moved out and was safe from being abused.

my mum and dad both work away during the week and are only home on the weekends.

My sister and I are left to fend for our selves, I was aged 13-14 at the time. 

Around 14 this age my mother stops saying goodnight to me on the phone and she stops saying she loves me, but she would still say goodnight to my little sister. 

when I was 15 at school I leaned that I had the right to not be physically abused. 

Later on my father punches me in the face for wanting to visit my male best friend at the time William, 

(my mum usually allows me to see william on the weekends)

That lead me to leave home to find somewhere I would no longer be abused. 

I leave school, I get a job and move out, I was fired from my job for being sick, Wich is illegal but I was too young to know better. 

I get kicked out by my housemate because a friend of mine decided to be destructive to my house because she was being a bad egg at the time. 

Leaving me homeless. 

I was very young, no clue how the world worked out of home, scared, no income, no support, except one (male 18) named William. 

William allowed me to live with him in exchange for sex and housework. 

William also had a girlfriend at the time he would visit. 

I made the wrong choice here and I know I was wrong and I’m sorry to this later to be  ex girlfriend. 

For me my choice was shut up and be quiet and have a place to sleep or tell her what he was doing to me. 

My younger sister was all alone, I asked to move back home, my mum said she would ask my my little sister who was 12 at the time. 

My mum said my little sister said no. 

William grew to be more abusive, coming from an abusive family I didn’t have the tools to make better choices. He also becomes an alcoholic. 

William and I ,also some of our other friends 
start to casually smoke weed ,
but not much as we are so young and sensitive to it. 

One night, Williams roommate had a friend over name Leroy(M 22)

I was sitting outside in a depressive mess (my will to live dwindling) 

Leroy approached me alone and says “can I kiss you ?” And I said okay, okay but on the cheek and he said “no on the lips” and I lamented and said “okay fine”. 

Then he asked me if I wanted to try MDMA, 
I said “I haven’t ever had that before “
Leroy says “its like a happy feelings, makes you feel love” 
I said “okay” (being self destructive because of my mental health) 

Then he asks me what I’m doing that night and I said nothing (my life consisted of trying to find food and crying, at that point). 

Then Leroy invited me to his house, and I said “okay”, we went to his house. 

The night is all a blur, I remember being in a bath with baby oil in it, 
looking a Leroy’s filthy kitchen with fungus growing from a pan lid, his lounge room filled with mess, 
a pill press and Bowls of colour powders and bags of clear powder, 
a homemade bong ect, while I was high he kept offering me all kinds of drugs, he SA me, 3 days pass 

I come to my senses and remember where I am, gather the very few things I came with and leave to go back to Williams house. 

Around this time i tired and was denied centerlink because my family refused to say I didn’t live with them, and also the centerlink councillor refused to approved me 
saying I couldn’t prove I didn’t live with my family, having no way to prove it. 

At age 16 I had a short relationship with another man that ended badly because of me doing the wrong thing. 

Around 17 William and I have relationship, he cheats the entire time like usually, and I grow to be unfazed,(it’s my fault for dating him) 

Lilly starts to date Leroy, and they both come over to Williams, 

Lilly gifts me some paints and pencils, Leroy is very controlling to Lilly while she is there, we don’t talk for long, no numbers exchanged. 

a few years pass and I’m about to turn 18.

Finally Centrelink approves me and my mother perhaps feeling guilty pays for a tafe course for me to attend.

By 19 William and I have to move out of his share house because of his roommate becoming aggressive with me, his roommate tried to brake my arm because I wouldn’t allow him to beat his own girlfriend in front of me. 

We move to Williams parents house they don’t allow us to live inside and instead we are either allowed to be in the laundry or in a tent outside.

They have an over crowed house as is , the laundry is so small only one person can lay down at once, so we live in a tent.

I’m now 19.

For context this is during the recession the year is 2010, employment is unattainable for lower educated people in our small town, all the teenagers jobs for 19 year olds only went to uni students or higher educated people, money was tight jobs were few and customer were few. 

Unable to get work I go back to TAFE to study year 10, that winter it drops down to the minus temperature where we live in our tent. 

Lilly is also at tafe and she shows me where she studies at tafe,in the arts rooms, it’s a short but sweet conversation.

During this time I was desperately trying to get a home William would not help.

he didn’t want to apply with me and he started to drink more and would no longer shower. 

One morning I woke up and William started to kick me over and over again ,I beg him to stop but he wouldn’t, and he refused to speak while he was doing it, I grabbed a few things and left his parents. 

I went to our drug dealers house the nearest person I knew, I stayed with him for 2 weeks, during that time he took all my money from me and spent it all on drugs for him ,saying he would get it back, but didn’t and I left, 

I had no where eles to go so I went to Leroy’s 

Leroy and Lilly had broken up, I was unsure of how long ago, but it felt like at least a few moths, Lilly was already dating another boyfriend.

Leroy and I did drugs and went on a bender or 2, then I don’t even think he ever asked me to be his gf, we just started cohabiting.

he wanted to move to QLD, I had no choice but to follow, so I did, while I was with him he started to pick at me and would shame my body all the time, I was a size 8-10 Australian in clothing already, I eventually got a eating disorder and was making my self vomit because of all the bullying he was doing to me.

One night while I was exercising on my bike, a man rides up next to me and we start chatting he tells me story’s about him taking acid with a broken leg, and I tell him my issues about my partner and my weight and he tells me that I’m not fat and don’t listen to my partner and I snapped of the delusions I was being fed. 

I eventually brake up with Leroy and move in with some hippies. 

Most of a year later I move home to my parents for about 2 weeks max, (my dad was very unhappy about me moving home temporarily) and I get a job and move out. 

Then I eventually, 
I get Lilly’s number (this is our first long conversation) 

I talk to her about the horrors of dating Leroy and she also vents to me about what she went through with him and we bond over that. 

We are friends for 10 years through the highs and the lows, brake ups with boyfriends, partying, sleep overs and cute coffee friend dates,
often talking for hours. 

Around late 20s she dates a man that cheats on her and she stays with him, she is still with him to this day.She can’t really trust him, it’s an off relationship. 

Now 10+ years we have been friends and she has an issues with me dating Leroy in the past and she brings it up. 

At first I was kinda caught off gaurd and defensive, then I talked it out with my therapist at the time and she said I need to apologise to her to make her happy, not what I think is right.

so I apologise to her because it’s her feelings and it’s my friend and I care about her, but my apology came out not perfect, because of my own ego and anxiety, but I did try my best i could muster.

she kinda batts off my apology, and said I was right and that she felt like she was making a big deal out of nothing, but now she still holds it against me, and it still come out in our conversation she makes small jabs at me. 
what do I do ? AITAH?
I love my friend

But no matter what I do, you’re all I can ever think about.

I wanted to gently put the memories away. To tuck them into a quiet corner of my heart and visit them only when it felt safe. But they don’t stay put. They resurface constantly. Some days it feels like I’m drowning in them.

And I don’t understand why I can’t just do what other people seem to do lock it all away, move on, let go. Why does this still haunt me? 

I miss you all the time. At home, when I’m making coffee and instinctively glance toward the hallway, still expecting you to walk through it. When I walk into the bedroom and the silence feels heavier because you’re not there to tuck yourself into me while I ramble about something that made you laugh.I miss you in the quiet, when I reach for my phone without thinking, only to stop myself. And when I’m out, and something happens I know would’ve made you laugh so hard you’d wheeze, I still catch myself turning to share it with you.

I miss your laugh. I miss how it made everything feel lighter. I miss how your presence made even the most ordinary moments feel like they meant something. And I know you’re not coming back. I’ve said it to myself so many times it should be easier by now. And still, I can’t let go. I’ve tried. I’ve talked to other people. I’ve let them in. I’ve let them touch me. And every time, I feel like I’m betraying some sacred vow. Not because you’re still mine. You’re not. because there’s still something in me that belongs to you. I know there always will be. 

My heart is yours. Whether you’ve kept it or dropped it somewhere along the way for someone else’s, it’s still out there. Beating stupidly for you. stubbornly loyal to a ghost. And maybe that’s the hardest part. I want to move on. I want to stop aching. But fuck, I just love you. I love you more than anything. And I don’t know what to do with that now, with no place left to put it.

Everyone says time heals. People say love will soften. But they never tell you what to do when it doesn’t.

So I’m writing about you again. Because even if it’s one sided, even if it’s hopeless, this love is the last honest thing I have left in me.

My only concern is that after I drink around 1L of yerba I have to urinate quite a lot and it feels uncomfortable if I'm out and about because of this effect I always need to find toilet lol. I'm not sure if I put too much herba or if that is normal to happen but it seems to be excessive, I know caffeine is diuretic but coffee does not signal this huge amount of urine. You could also argue that I don't drink 1.5l of coffee of course and that's true but I feel I might be doing something wrong or my system is sensitive to Yerba.. however I enjoy how it makes me feel and the positivity that comes along with the energy.

For twenty-five years, I was the quiet wife and the selfless mother—ironing shirts, folding laundry, and waiting for the day my husband, Bradley, would finally keep the promise he made when we married.

“We never had a wedding,” I reminded him on our twenty-fifth anniversary. “Just papers at city hall. I thought maybe… this year, we could take a cruise. Just the two of us.”

He laughed—sharp and cold.

“A cruise? At your age? Don’t be ridiculous. You should be more like your cousin Maine. She’s smart. Independent. She doesn’t need anyone to fund her silly dreams.”

Maine. My cousin. The woman he once loved. The woman he said wasn’t right for marriage—until now.

That night, I saw it. An email in his inbox. A cruise reservation. A wedding invitation. Maine and my husband.

The invitees? My son. My daughter-in-law. My father.

They all knew. They replaced me.

And they lied—calling it a business trip, saying I wouldn’t understand. That I wasn’t smart enough to be part of it.

So I smiled. I watched them leave in the clothes I had packed for them. Then I changed the locks, blocked their numbers, and filed for divorce.

They didn’t choose me. But this time—I choose myself.

Because after twenty-five years of being silenced, overlooked, and invisible… I’m finally ready to live out loud.



For twenty-five years, I served my husband and my son, forgetting and sacrificing myself. And now on our twenty-fifth anniversary, I thought maybe it was time for me. So, I asked my husband Bradley to fulfill his promise.

""Do you remember what you promised me when we got married?"" He didn’t lift his head from his phone. ""We never had a wedding, just signed the papers at city hall, and then… life got busy. But this year—it’s our twenty-fifth. I thought maybe… we could go on a cruise. Just the two of us.""

He looked at me like I had said something offensive.

""A cruise?"" he barked, his eyes narrowing. Then he laughed—sharp and cold. ""What for? You're old enough to know better. Cruises aren't for women like you. You don't even have your own money, Joyce. You want to use my money for some stupid luxury when you know the company’s barely holding on because of investor pullouts? Do you even care about me? About what I'm going through?""

His words didn’t shout, but they cut.

""I just..."" I whispered, ""I just want to enjoy something. Anything. For twenty-five years, I stayed here. You promised me a wedding back then. Maybe this could be the time—""

He cut me off, loud and sharp now.

""Enjoy?"" he scoffed. ""Are you saying you didn’t enjoy your life for the past twenty-five years? Are you blaming me for how boring it was? You sound ungrateful, Joyce. I worked so hard, and you just stayed here—cleaning, eating, no real stress. Maybe you should be more like your cousin Maine. Now that’s a woman. Smart, successful. Doesn’t rely on anyone for her stupid whims.""

My hands were trembling. The glass of water I held slipped and shattered at my feet. I flinched as the shards scattered.

That sound summoned my father, Joseph, from the other room.

""What's wrong with you?"" he growled, storming in. ""Are you really this useless? You can’t even hold a glass? You know how much that costs? You can’t even pay for your own food, and now you're breaking things?""

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t.

""You’re the same age as Maine, yet she looks ten years younger. She walks like a woman with purpose. You? You drag your feet like you’re already dead. Honestly, sometimes I wish Maine was my daughter instead of you.""

Bradley chuckled awkwardly. ""Don’t be too harsh on her, Father. Come on. She’s still your daughter.”

Then he turned to me.

""And you, Joyce, don’t take it seriously. We just want you to… improve. Be more like Maine, maybe.""

But my father wasn’t done.

""Improve?"" he spat. ""There’s no improving her. You said it yourself once, Bradley. You regretted marrying young. You said Maine was the better candidate. And I agreed. But you still married my daughter. And she should be grateful for that every day of her life.""

I stood still. Cold. Paralyzed. A tightness wrapped itself around my ribs, squeezing.

I bent down to pick up the shattered glass, but my hands were shaking too much. A sharp edge sliced into my palm, but I didn’t flinch. I watched the blood trail down my wrist, felt it drip onto the tiles.

No one stopped me. They just kept talking. Laughing. Like I wasn’t there.

Bradley’s voice returned, distant and cruel. “Well, Maine is admirable, but Joyce... Joyce is convenient.”

Convenient. Like plastic furniture. Like disposable napkins.

I didn’t speak. What was left to say?

I gathered the broken pieces with both hands now, ignoring the pain. Blood smeared across my fingers. No one offered a towel. No one asked if I was okay.

I went to the sink, turned on the water. It ran red before it ran clear. I stared at my reflection in the kitchen window. Who is she? This tired woman. This fading thing.

Later on, they all went to eat dinner and like a servant, I placed the bowls on the table, one by one. I’d made soup just like what Bradley wanted to eat for tonight.

He took one sip and spat it back in the bowl. ""What's this? It tastes like garbage.""

Chapter 2 

I blinked. My hands trembled as I held the serving spoon.

“I—I’ll change the soup,” I said softly, already reaching for the bowl.

Bradley slammed his spoon down. “Come on, Joyce. If you’re still mad at me because of what I said earlier, this isn’t the right way to take it out. Trying to poison me with that taste? You didn’t even make an effort. That’s your only job.”

Only job. That phrase stayed in the air, louder than his voice.

To them, that’s all it was. Cooking. Cleaning. Washing. Being their shadow. It didn’t matter that I was the first to rise in this house and the last to sleep. It didn’t matter that I raised our son when Bradley worked late or went on “business trips.” I was a housewife, and for them, that meant I wasn’t really contributing. I wasn’t building an empire. I wasn’t earning figures. I was just a woman who washed clothes and waited for orders.

I used to think being here was fulfilling. That staying behind to raise a family and tend to a home was noble. But what did I really raise? A son too busy to visit. A husband who looked at me like I was a liability. A father who never saw me beyond the girl who didn’t measure up to Maine.

And maybe that was the real sin—I let it happen. I chose this life. I allowed myself to disappear in it.

Tears welled up, blurring the sight of the table. My voice cracked as I whispered, “I’ll make a new batch.”

The door suddenly swung open. Click. High heels. A familiar voice. 

“Oh! Sorry, did I interrupt something?”

Maine. Of course. Even the sound of her walking in felt expensive. She wore success like a perfume. Confident. Composed. A woman people admired. The daughter my father always wished he had.

“I just came by to drop off some business files,” she said, flashing that smile of hers. “So we can settle things.”

My father stood immediately, like he was summoned. “No, not really. We’re just having dinner.”

Maine’s eyes darted toward the table. “Oh, great. Then, can I eat some? I’m sure it’s amazing. After all, my cousin Joyce cooked it.”

Bradley scoffed. “It’s not, actually. Tastes like nothing. Not a great idea, really.” He pushed the bowl away with a dramatic grimace. “How about we all just go out? Let’s eat somewhere decent. My treat.”

I looked down at my hands. They were still stained with onion from chopping. They reeked of oil.

“Oh, sure,” Maine said brightly. “That sounds fun.”

Father nodded in agreement. “I’ve been craving that grilled seafood place.”

Then Maine turned to me. “Joyce, you’re coming, right?”

I lifted my head, just as Bradley answered for me. “Oh, she’s busy,” he said with a wave of his hand. “She’s got house things to do. She can eat this one, so it won’t go to waste, right? And she’s not into these things anyway. We’re going to talk about business stuff—nothing she’d be interested in.”

Nothing I’d be interested in. As if I didn’t want to leave this house even once. As if I didn’t want to eat something warm and served to me instead of cold leftovers.

Maine hesitated, but then smiled again. “Okay then. I’ll just bring you some food from the restaurant, cousin. Something nice, alright?”

They left in laughter. They didn’t even say goodbye.

I stood there. Alone in a dining room that smelled of disappointment and burnt soup.

I sat down and tasted the very same bowl Bradley spat in. It was bland. Too much water, too little salt. I messed up. But not because I wanted to hurt him. I just... I just couldn’t taste anything anymore.

I looked around the house I spent twenty-five years serving. The walls I repainted myself. The furniture I cleaned. The floors I mopped on my knees. The clothes I ironed. The birthdays I planned. The Christmases I decorated.

And yet I wasn’t a wife. I wasn’t a partner.

I was their help.

Their convenience.

And that realization hurt more than anything.

I forced myself to finish the soup. I cleaned the table. I washed the dishes. I wiped the counter.

I folded the napkins like I always did. Then I went upstairs and sat on the edge of the bed we used to share, the one that now felt too wide, too cold.

I pressed my hand to my chest and whispered, “I chose this.”

I let them shape me into what they wanted.

I let myself disappear. But maybe—just maybe—I didn’t have to stay this way.

Maybe I could still find pieces of who I used to be.

Before I became invisible. And as the sound of their laughter echoed from the driveway, I finally allowed myself to cry—loud and unashamed—for the woman I once was, and the woman I might still be.

Chapter 3

I quietly rolled out of bed and walked straight to the cabinet in the corner of our room—my little sanctuary. It was where I kept the few things that were mine. Not the house, not the kitchen, not the endless chores or errands I did for the family—but the small luxuries I saved up for with my own money.

The makeup I had finally bought last week after five long years of selling flowers from my garden was gone.

My heart skipped. I opened and closed every drawer, checked the boxes twice. Gone. All of it.

I rushed into the living room where Bradley sat on the couch, his eyes glued to the documents in his hands, probably something about the company again. 

“Bradley,” I said as calmly as I could, “Did you see the makeup I kept in the cabinet?”

He didn’t even look up. “Ah, those? I gave them to Maine. She sealed that big deal with the Japanese investors, thought she deserved something nice.”

My breath caught. “You… gave them to her?” My voice shook. “That was mine. I just bought that.”

He finally looked up, chuckling like it was some sort of joke. “Bought it? Joyce, come on. Why would you buy makeup? It’s not like you’re going anywhere. You’re too old for those things.”

“Bradley—”

“No, really.” He smirked. “Have you looked in the mirror lately? Be honest with yourself. It doesn’t suit you anymore. But Maine? Now she’s different. She works hard, she deserves it.”

“It was mine!” I yelled, my hands trembling. “I bought it with my own money!”

He rolled his eyes. “Own money? What are you talking about? All the money you use comes from me, Joyce. Don’t pretend otherwise.”

My lips parted, but the words couldn’t come out. In my heart, I screamed. It was from the flowers I sold. I tended that garden with blistered hands and sunburned skin. I saved every dollar, every coin for five years.

Not once did I ask him for a cent for anything that wasn’t for the house or the family. I knew he’d see it as a burden. So I didn’t. I waited. I worked. And now it was gone—given to someone else as if I didn’t matter.

He leaned back with a sigh. “Stop whining. I’ll just get you something else, okay?”

“You really don’t care about me,” I whispered.

Bradley frowned. “You’re being dramatic. Come on, be considerate for once. Maine practically saved the company, Joyce. She deserves some appreciation. You wouldn’t understand—you don’t know a thing about business. So stop overreacting and start cooking. I’m starving.”

His voice stung like a slap.

I turned to walk away, feeling like my chest was about to shatter into a thousand pieces.

“By the way,” he added lazily, “I’ll be gone. Business trip. One week. So you can take a little break from taking care of me.”

I said nothing and walked into the kitchen. I cooked. Again. Just like always.

Later that afternoon, our son arrived with his wife. I smiled automatically, like I was supposed to. Like a painting that no one bothered to repaint.

While eating, they talked excitedly about the upcoming trip.

“It’s gonna be beautiful,” my daughter-in-law said. “A cruise ship. Top deck. Fancy dinners. Hot springs. Can’t wait!”

“I thought it was a business trip,” I murmured.

“Oh, well, business and pleasure,” my son added quickly. “Don’t worry, Mom. We’ll take home something nice for you. A souvenir or two!”

“A magnet would be nice,” I joked weakly. My laughter came out hollow.

My father, sitting beside me, shook his head. “If only you knew more about business, you could join.”

I nodded and smiled again. Pretending didn't even hurt anymore—it was just numb.

That night, I was folding Bradley’s clothes for the trip. His laptop, still open, buzzed softly with a notification.

I glanced. Then froze.

The screen showed an email confirmation for the cruise. A luxury getaway package. Couples’ massages. Candlelight dinners. Honeymoon suite.

I blinked. Honeymoon?

I opened the attached documents with a trembling hand. An invitation.

A wedding invitation.

Maine. And Bradley.

My knees buckled. I dropped into the chair, hands shaking as the names on the glossy page glared back at me.

Maine and Bradley. You are cordially invited to celebrate our union aboard the St. Clarisse Luxury 

It wasn’t just a trip. It was a betrayal. It was a celebration. Everyone knew. My son. My father. The people I cooked for, cleaned for, cared for. The people I stayed behind for.

And none of them said a word.

My vision blurred as tears spilled freely. Not because of the makeup. Not because of the trip.

But because I gave them my life. My time. My love. My everything.

And it meant nothing.

I covered my mouth and wept silently in the dark, while outside the house, laughter echoed down the halls as the people I loved planned their future—without me.

Chapter 4 

""Joyce,"" he said once, voice low and intimate, his arm lazily wrapped around my shoulder, ""I know you’d take care of me better than anyone, even Maine. I love her, yes, I want her, but she’d choose her career over me any day. You—Joyce, you’re the type who’d serve, who’d stay. And for that, I’ll give you the best life you could imagine.""

I believed him. Like a fool, I believed him. I let him register our marriage. No ceremony. No friends. No flowers. Just two signatures on cold, government-issued paper and a promise I etched into my heart like scripture. I was in love. So painfully in love. But now I see it—he never chose me. I was never the first. I was the fallback. The safe place to land when Maine took off for her ambitions.

And now? I was just… the maid who shared his last name.

The next day, not a single soul in the house asked if I had slept well. No one noticed my red-rimmed eyes or the tremble in my hands as I poured coffee. Instead, the living room buzzed with laughter and shallow excitement. 

The scent of fresh fabric filled the air as designer bags lay scattered over the couch. I stood silently, hands clasped together, watching them marvel over their outfits like it was the most important day of their lives.

My son turned to me, grinning wide. “Mom, guess what? We’re attending a wedding on the cruise, aside from the business trip or course! Isn’t that amazing? It’s gonna be such a big event!”

I blinked, pretending not to know whose wedding it would be. “A wedding?”

Maine was standing near him, holding up a white dress against her body, checking herself in the hallway mirror.

I frowned, curious. “Who’s getting married? Why can’t I come with you?”

My father scoffed as if I’d asked something ridiculous. “You’re staying here to take care of the house, of course. And since when are you interested in these things? It’s someone from Bradley’s business circle, nothing related to you.”

I forced a smile. A pathetic little curve of my lips. “Of course.”

“Don’t worry, Mom,” my son added, chuckling, “We’ll bring back lots of souvenirs. I know you love those herbal oils from duty-free.”

Maine giggled behind him, and said, ""We'll just send photos, so you will be updated.""

My chest tightened.

Bradley, appearing from the hallway in a tailored shirt, tossed a pile of clothes into my arms. “Here. Iron these. And be careful—they’re expensive.”

The morning of their departure, the house was loud with perfume, zipped luggages, and last-minute instructions. I stood in the corner, quietly folding last-minute scarves, fixing collars, adjusting buttons. My role was clear: the background woman. Invisible until something went wrong.

A shriek from the hallway. “My dress!” Maine cried out. “There’s a hole in it!”

Everyone rushed in. The white dress—elegant, pristine, absurdly expensive—had a tiny tear near the hem. But it was enough to ruin her morning.

Bradley turned, eyes blazing. “Joyce! What the heck did you do?”

“I—I didn’t do anything. I sent it to the shop, just like the others. They must’ve—”

“I told you to handle it, not strangers! Why would you let someone else touch her dress? Are you going to pay for this?!”

“I— I didn’t mean—”

“It’s fine,” Maine said gently, stepping in like a peacekeeper. “Don’t be mad at her. She’s your wife.”

Bradley scoffed. “Yeah. My useless wife.”

He turned away from me without another glance, wrapping an arm around Maine’s shoulder. “Let’s go get you another one. We’ll be late if we don’t leave now.”

He threw the dress at me. I stood frozen. As they gathered their luggage, laughing and chatting about the events on the cruise, I stared at the empty doorway. They didn’t even look back. Not one.

Chapter 5 

Maine: Joyce, I’m sorry. The shop already apologized. You shouldn’t have been blamed for the dress. Please don’t think too much about it.”

I read it once. Then twice. Did she mean it? Or was it just a bandage for a wound she helped create? A soft message to wash away the image of Bradley shoving me, of everyone turning their backs while I stood in shock, humiliated?

Before I could decide, another message arrived.

Bradley: I left the black card on the kitchen counter. Buy anything you want today since you’ll be alone for one week.

I nearly laughed.

This was how it always went with him. First the fury, the blame, the cruelty—and then, the guilt gift. The apology disguised as permission to spend his money. As if a new dress or a bag could undo the things he said. The things he did. I could almost hear his voice in my head: Here, buy yourself something. Now smile like a good girl.

I didn’t respond. I just stared at their names—Maine and Bradley—and in one swift, final movement, I deleted both messages and blocked their numbers.

Later that day, I decided to step outside. I put on the dress Bradley once said looked “too loud” and the lipstick he told me “made me look old.” I wore both. Proudly.

I had a little money stashed away—hidden savings he never cared to know about. I clutched my small bag and walked into the city like I had somewhere to be, even if it was just a place where I could breathe.

There was this café I had passed a hundred times before. Every time I hinted I wanted to try them, Bradley would shut it down.

“Cake? Again? You already look like you’ve had enough,” he’d say, always with that half-smirk, as if it were a joke I was supposed to laugh at.

But I’d seen him offer the same cake to Maine once, all sweet smiles and soft hands. I didn’t say a word back then. ",1,1748333705.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I feel the stagnation, I have zero momentum on the career ladder now, comparing back then I'm pretty aggressive, I can work all day long just to achieve things that I want. I lost interest of things I used to love to do, like my hobbies and my favorite games, I'm in a stressful and high-pace job environment, whenever there is a pause or an idle time, i get burnouts and random surge of sadness. The only soacial activities I have is to entertain my customers, other than that I'm pretty much working all day long. I am deleting all the social media apps. There are good achievement in my life where I supposed to feel thrilled (e.g. getting promotion, profiting from stock market), I feel completely numb and nothing. Sometimes I find those who can laugh spontaneously, seeing that, i felt a deep resonance within me.
