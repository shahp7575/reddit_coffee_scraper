Essential Aftercare Tips for Maintaining Your Whitening Results
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you have recently undergone professional teeth bleaching, you want to make the most of your dazzling results. Maintaining that vibrant smile involves adopting certain aftercare practices. Here are vital tips to keep your teeth white and bright after the procedure.

### Limit Certain Foods and Drinks

One of the most effective ways to prolong your whitening results is to pay attention to what you eat and drink. Some items can stain your teeth, reversing the effects of bleaching:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Coffee and Tea:** These beverages are notorious for staining teeth. If you must indulge, consider using a straw to minimize contact with your teeth.
- **Red Wine:** This drink can leave stubborn stains. Enjoy in moderation and rinse your mouth with water afterward.
- **Colored Sauces:** Foods like tomato sauce and soy sauce can also lead to discoloration. Opt for lighter alternatives when possible.
- **Certain Fruits:** Berries and citrus fruits may stain due to their vibrant colors. Rinse your mouth with water after consuming them.

### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

Following a consistent oral care routine is crucial for maintaining your whitening results. Here are some steps to consider:

- **Brush Twice Daily:** Use a whitening toothpaste that is gentle on your enamel. Brush in the morning and before bedtime to remove any surface stains.
- **Floss Regularly:** Flossing helps eliminate food particles and plaque buildup, promoting overall oral health.
- **Use Mouthwash:** Choose an antibacterial mouthwash that is alcohol-free to protect your enamel while keeping your mouth fresh.

### Stay Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water is not only essential for your overall health but also plays a key role in maintaining your bright smile. Water helps rinse away food particles and acids that could stain your teeth. Consider these tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Swish Water After Eating:** Rinsing your mouth with water after meals can help remove lingering stains.
- **Avoid Sugary Drinks:** Sodas and energy drinks can lead to tooth decay and staining. Opt for water or other clear drinks instead.

### Consider Touch-up Treatments

While you may have achieved great results from professional bleaching, touch-up treatments can help you maintain that bright smile over time. Speak with your dentist about any at-home whitening products they recommend. Here are some options:

- **Whitening Strips:** These can be used periodically to maintain your shade. Follow the instructions carefully to avoid damaging your enamel.
- **Whitening Gels:** Your dentist may suggest a custom whitening kit that allows you to touch up your results safely.

### Avoid Tobacco Products

Besides being harmful to your health, smoking and chewing tobacco can significantly discolor your teeth. If you want to maintain your newly whitened smile, it‚Äôs best to quit tobacco in all its forms. Seek support from professionals or use cessation aids if you find quitting challenging.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Regular Dental Check-ups

Keeping up with regular dental visits is crucial for maintaining your whitening results. Schedule appointments at least twice a year to ensure your teeth and gums are healthy. Your dentist can also provide professional cleanings to remove any surface stains that may accumulate over time.

### The Bottom Line

With these essential aftercare tips, you can enjoy your professional teeth whitening results for months to come. Focus on good oral hygiene, avoid certain foods and drinks, and stay proactive about maintaining your bright smile. Remember, your sparkling smile is an investment in your confidence and overall appearance, so give it the care it deserves!

Many individuals experience drastic improvements in their smile, transforming dull or stained teeth into bright, radiant ones. The before and after effects are often striking, making it clear why so many choose this cosmetic treatment.

I‚Äôm traveling to LBC at the end of January to look for rentals - I‚Äôd love suggestions on where to prioritize or avoid. About us:

My SO will work in Costa Mesa 

I will commute to LA 

Budget is ~$3500 

My SO needs a minimum of 850- 900 sq ft

We‚Äôre looking for somewhere you can find a community, and where everyday things aren‚Äôt super inconvenient like groceries/gas etc. 

We have two French bulldogs who are a big part of our life 

FOOD is a high priority; it doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy, hainan chicken& Ethiopian are more exciting to us than a hip cocktail bar. 

On the weekends we like to try new restaurants,go to saturday markets and coffee shops,gardens,bookstores, play board games. 

We both workout, are socially active in our communities, play on a few indoor soccer teams together. 

I‚Äôm from the PNW & living next to any body of water appeals to me.. or somewhere with parks and old trees. 

We wouldn‚Äôt have left our home to move to LBC but my SO got a job offer we couldn‚Äôt refuse and it‚Äôs the right choice for our careers, so on an adventure we go!! 

I guess what I want to know is, is long beach right for us? What areas do you recommend? I keep seeing posts that say if you‚Äôre not on the furthest east side of LBC it‚Äôs dangerous and terrible to live in, which concerns me. Is there really a 20 block radius that‚Äôs safe and otherwise it‚Äôs bad, that seems crazy?

The last week there has been a noticeable change: much less need for sleep and demanding way more stimulation. She‚Äôs discovered the recycling bags, that destroyable items are on the coffee table and that the corners of walls are alternatives to her chews. She‚Äôs even started growling when the neighbours are outside.

This is so far DOABLE but my worry is how bad it will get in the few couple months, especially if her first heat gets thrown in the mix. On top of this I broke up with my partner so will be moving to a new home and at some point I need to start working again (took time off just to focus on the puppy).

I used to have great hair without even trying. At 29, I decided to go hard on intermittent fasting and keto, plus a crazy amount of caffeine.

My routine was:

	‚Ä¢	No food till noon, just coffee
	‚Ä¢	Huge family-size moka pot (4 servings), stuffed full, twice a day
	‚Ä¢	Only protein and fat, basically zero carbs

My body looked insane. First time ever seeing arm veins and abs starting to show. I was pumped.

But then things got weird:

	‚Ä¢	Super nervous and paranoid all the time
	‚Ä¢	Couldn‚Äôt stop worrying about everything
	‚Ä¢	Only sleeping 4 hours and feeling fine (red flag, I know now)

Then BAM! Noticed a bald spot on my crown. Freaked me out because my hair was perfect just 3 months before. Thought it was the keto, so I quit that.

Kept pounding caffeine though (600-800mg daily) because of mood issues. Later got diagnosed with ADHD and doc pointed out I was self-medicating with caffeine.
Started Vyvanse (50mg) but still couldn‚Äôt kick the coffee habit. Still drinking 300-400mg daily. Hair just kept getting worse. Felt like crap about myself for ruining my hair.

Recently realized all this caffeine might be messing with my digestion and making me anxious 24/7. Trying to cut back to 200mg now, aiming for 50mg max eventually. ADHD makes it tough though. Feel like garbage without it, even with Vyvanse.

Here‚Äôs my theory: I can see tiny hairs in the bald spots. I think if I can chill out, sleep more, and not be in stress mode all day, it might grow back some. Christmas break is coming up, so I‚Äôm gonna try to cut way back and push through the suck. Thinking maybe 3-4 months to see if it helps (if I can stick to it this time).

I (F) had met this guy (M) at a side gig I do and we have been chatting. I felt there was maybe something there as we always would stare at each for longer than normal, and slowly started coming out of my shell.

Since my team had given his team a hard time, I baked some madeleines as a thank you and it was also my friend‚Äôs birthday. I ran into him and he complimented them saying they were good and had already had 3 of them. The proceeded to ask me where I got them to where I said I made them. And he proceeded to say he liked them and I thanked him.

We share some interests in anime and manga and slowly started talking about it to where I said I had a list for him which I do. My last shift was hard and decided to shoot my shot and ask him to get coffee.

At first he seemed shocked and surprised like at first and then said maybe‚Ä¶yes. And then we got interrupted and then I was waiting for someone else to grab me an item. I then needed another item and he helped me and so when I said that we‚Äôd need to be able to contact him we exchanged phone numbers. He seemed excited and asked me if I was around for the holiday and got interrupted again where I wasn‚Äôt able to answer but then I asked if he was around and he said yes. He told me his family is all local- his sister, mom, aunt and that he‚Äôd be around.

This is the first time in a long time that I asked for a phone number so when I got it I didn‚Äôt text him until I was off. But when I did I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I took a friend‚Äôs advice which was a mistake. My friend suggested saying ‚Äúhi, thank you for the compliment on the madeleines‚Äù and I did but didn‚Äôt get a text and that was on Wednesday. Then on Friday, I sent a follow up text saying ‚Äúhey x, what are you around to this weekend? Are you around to nerd out on anime/manga?‚Äù And he did see the message on Saturday (yesterday) but didn‚Äôt reply.

I should add that I don‚Äôt date and haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôve recently come out of my shell a lot and feel more confident than I have in years due to things I‚Äôve done that have physically changed my appearance like losing weight, changing my hair, getting Invisalign and regularly working out and buying newer clothes to replace my old wardrobe which fit closer to my body now. I still continuing my weight loss journey and losing weight.

My question is- why would someone say yes and exchange phone numbers only to not reply? I guess at this point, I assume he‚Äôs not interested but why not just say no?

And also, moving forward, I was planning on just continuing to be me which is saying hi, asking how they (him and his team) are and moving on. Maybe playfully if the time presents being like ‚Äúoh yeah, I texted you‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know the dating norms so idk on things like reply time and waiting. I felt really good at first then spiralled and felt deflated. I am starting to put myself out there and downloaded a dating app to just become more comfortable with chatting and whatnot. 

Anyways, please share any insight to someone who has focused my life thus far on career, family, education and recently health instead of dating. I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs not interested and am nearly at peace with it after talking to friends and therapist. I know it‚Äôs partially my anxiety getting in the way too of wanting to close the loop. Or just in general tips to move on, self care, anything helps! Thank you in advance. ",1,1734938990.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

This is where SCILD (Subconsciously Conditioned Induced Lucid Dreaming) comes into play.

The Invention of SCILD:

SCILD was born out of the need for a simple, reliable, and repetitive strategy that would trigger lucidity naturally without overwhelming the dreamer. The core idea behind SCILD is rooted in the psychological principle of classical conditioning‚Äîthe process of associating a stimulus (something you regularly encounter) with a specific response (a reality check that leads to lucidity).

The goal of SCILD is to make reality checks so automatic that they become second nature. By consistently linking a frequent trigger from your waking life to a reality check, you‚Äôre gradually training your subconscious mind to perform that same check when you‚Äôre dreaming. This process helps you realize you‚Äôre in a dream and take control of it.

The Aim:

SCILD aims to achieve frequent lucid dreams by conditioning the subconscious mind through repetitive, specific triggers that occur often in your waking life. The strategy is designed to be simple, practical, and easy to integrate into your daily routine. The fewer the triggers and the more frequent they are, the greater your chances of lucidity. The key is to find one trigger that happens consistently throughout your day to make the process as effective as possible.

Step-by-Step Strategy for SCILD:

1.	Choose a Frequent Trigger:  
  
‚Ä¢	Select something that you experience regularly in your waking life. This could be a common object (like your phone), an action (such as hearing a doorbell), or even a situation (like seeing a certain street sign). The more frequent, the better, as this will ensure your mind is repeatedly exposed to the trigger.

Examples:

‚Ä¢	Checking your phone screen.  
  
‚Ä¢	Hearing a car honk.  
  
‚Ä¢	Seeing a specific brand of a coffee cup.  
  
‚Ä¢	Walking through a particular doorway.  
  
2.	Decide on Your Reality Check:  
  
‚Ä¢	Choose a simple and effective reality check to perform each time you encounter your trigger. This could be:  
  
‚Ä¢	Looking at your hands and asking, ‚ÄúAm I dreaming?‚Äù  
  
‚Ä¢	Trying to push your finger through your palm.  
  
‚Ä¢	Pinching your nose and attempting to breathe through it (if it works, you‚Äôre dreaming).  
  
‚Ä¢	Checking a digital clock (if the time is nonsensical or changes, you‚Äôre likely dreaming).

The reality check should be straightforward and something you can easily do without disrupting your day too much.

3.	Consistency in Reality Checking:  
  
‚Ä¢	Every time your chosen trigger occurs, immediately perform the reality check. Don‚Äôt hesitate‚Äîmake it a reflex. The more consistent you are with this, the stronger the association between the trigger and the reality check becomes.  
  
4.	Link the Trigger to Lucidity:  
  
‚Ä¢	As you continue to associate the trigger with the reality check, your subconscious will start to make the connection. Over time, the moment you encounter the trigger in your dreams, your mind will automatically prompt you to perform the reality check, which leads to lucidity.  
  
5.	Stay Focused and Repetition is Key:  
  
‚Ä¢	The more often you perform the reality check with the trigger, the better your chances are of recognizing the same trigger in your dreams. Keep practicing during the day, and over time, it will naturally carry over into your dream state.  
  
6.	Maintain Awareness:  
  
‚Ä¢	SCILD works best if you‚Äôre consciously aware of your goal of lucid dreaming. Reflect on your dreams, stay mindful throughout the day, and periodically check if you‚Äôre dreaming, even if you don‚Äôt encounter the trigger. This heightened awareness will boost your chances of triggering lucidity when the moment comes.

Additional Insights and Tips for SCILD:

‚Ä¢	Start Simple: Choose a trigger that you encounter regularly and something that is easy to spot. Overcomplicating the process can lead to frustration and inconsistent results.  
  
‚Ä¢	Use Visual or Auditory Cues: Triggers that are highly visual (like seeing a particular object) or auditory (like a sound you often hear) are particularly powerful because they stand out more in the dream environment.  
  
‚Ä¢	Track Your Progress: Keep a dream journal. Write down your dreams every morning to track how often you‚Äôre becoming lucid and what triggers are working for you. This will help you refine your approach over time.  
  
‚Ä¢	Stay Patient: Like any skill, lucid dreaming requires practice. Don‚Äôt expect immediate results. With consistent effort, your subconscious mind will begin to respond more reliably to your chosen triggers.

Why SCILD Works:

SCILD leverages the power of habit formation and subconscious conditioning. By associating a frequent waking trigger with a reality check, you teach your brain to automatically perform that check when the same trigger occurs in a dream. This works because your subconscious mind doesn‚Äôt differentiate well between waking life and dreams until something unusual (like the trigger) shakes the normal reality.

In essence, SCILD builds a bridge between your waking awareness and dream awareness, making it more likely that you‚Äôll recognize you‚Äôre dreaming and gain lucidity. The beauty of SCILD is in its simplicity‚Äîit‚Äôs about focusing on one thing, repeatedly, and letting your mind do the rest.

Conclusion:

SCILD is a powerful yet simple lucid dreaming technique that focuses on conditioning your subconscious to recognize frequent triggers and perform reality checks automatically. By making your reality check reflexive and tied to something that happens often in your waking life, you increase the chances of becoming lucid in your dreams. With patience, consistency, and a mindful approach, SCILD can help you experience lucid dreams more frequently and with less effort.",1,1734938759.0,LucidDreaming,1,1.0,False

1hkin2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1hkin2t/not_paying_for_movie_house_snacks/,Not paying for movie house snacks. ,"Where I am from, it's very frowned upon to bring your own snacks to a theatre. Not illegal, but you are named and shamed in a way by staff.

It's funny because nobody names and shames these large corporate theatres/movie houses for the beyond obscene prices they charge.

I used to like popcorn‚Äîuntil their overpriced, stale cardboard disguised as ""buttery goodness"" stopped cutting it for me. And since I can‚Äôt always count on a theater employee to magically whip up gourmet snacks for me, I take matters into my own hands. Honestly, the quality and price of movie snacks have gone down significantly, and they are so stingy with the butter salt, which I like a lot. Instead of self-service salt or spice cans where you could pour loads of butter salt yourself, they now give you two small sachets to put in your popcorn, and they barely cover the top.

If you want more, it's $0.40 for another sachet. I assure you that the situation here is greed not decline. 

It's not that I can't afford it, it's just‚Äîwhy should watching a movie with shitty snacks cost $60 per person? It's the principle. I refuse to give money for a subpar snack that's just a slushy with regular popcorn, as simple as that. It's disgraceful. This might be an unpopular opinion, but after 2020, these theatres went wild with their charges. One could almost call it theft. Seriously, prices should have returned to normal by now. 

Don't even get me started on the so-called fancy theatres where they over-microwave literal nonsense like meatballs, chicken wings, etc., until it tastes like dried-out plastic. Even the coffees and hot chocolate are cheap, watery garbage, yet these huge theatres find it absolutely acceptable to serve dishwater. How the quality got so bad that they serve you old stale, overly microwave food over their once fresh food, I don't know. 

I realized that if I couldn't count on my female friends to bring in snacks, I would do it on my own.

Generally, I am straight acting. Nobody would ever question my sexuality. But being gay at the movies means one thing: nobody would think twice if I brought out my gayness and use a purse. Honestly, even if I weren‚Äôt gay, I‚Äôd still probably do the same.

Enter: the ‚Äúman purse.‚Äù Is it fabulous? No.

It is popular with men? No, I generally wouldn't be caught with one either.

But can it fit a large Tupperware? Absolutely. 

Last time, I brought in a regular Coke, a half-frozen Coke (for variety and to keep the first coke cool, duh), a whole pizza, chicken wings, and a burger. All while dodging suspicious side-eyes from the ticket counter. And it cost roughly the same as a regular popcorn with a drink. .... Yes, you best believe it. .... Can someone from head office, explain that pricing disparity? 

This might be unpopular, but I don't think doing this is wrong. Maybe where you are from, it's different. Where I am from, they tend to almost do strip searches and hold up the queue on purpose for however long they need while they give you time to ""consider"" throwing your food and drinks into a dustbin.

That and they are very aggressive when trying to get you to buy or tip them. Seriously, it is almost predatory to see what they do to young children and the elderly. 

But who's really going to question a 2-meter-tall, gym-loving dude rocking a rainbow shirt and abs for days? Exactly‚Äînobody. I look like a fridge with feelings. Woman or men with purses basically glide past, nobody checks a purse for food for some reason. 

Also, let‚Äôs be real: if I‚Äôm going to the movies, I‚Äôm getting my money‚Äôs worth. I usually marathon two films back-to-back because what‚Äôs better than one cinematic experience? Two‚Äîwith snacks watching films in Imax.

Way back when I earned my first check after high school about 3 years ago. I decided to ball on an Eau de Parfum. (Which ran me like almost $250).

1hkiexc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1hkiexc/got_a_moka_pot_recently/,got a moka pot recently.,"I recently got a moka pot because I was tired of drinking overly sweet, sugar-filled instant coffee with creamers and such. However, I‚Äôve noticed that moka pot coffee is a bit more bitter than I‚Äôm used to. While I‚Äôm not obsessed with using cream, I do like a subtle hint of it in my coffee.

Here‚Äôs my process: I use dark roasted beans, grind them to a fine consistency (similar to sand), fill the chamber with hot water, and then place the moka pot on the gas stove.

Am I doing something wrong? Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",4,1734937659.0,mokapot,7,1.0,False

Ensuring product compliance and adhering to international standards are crucial for successful exports. This process involves meeting regulatory requirements, obtaining certifications, and complying with sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) for certain products. Here's a detailed overview:

# 1. Export Product Certifications

Product certifications validate that a product meets specific safety, quality, or regulatory requirements for a particular market. These certifications vary by industry and target country.

# a. Key Global Product Certifications

1. **ISO Certifications (International Organization for Standardization)**:
   * **Definition**: Global standards ensuring quality, safety, and efficiency.
   * **Common ISO Standards**:
      * **ISO 9001**: Quality management systems.
      * **ISO 14001**: Environmental management systems.
      * **ISO 22000**: Food safety management systems.
   * **Importance**:
      * Enhances product credibility in global markets.
      * Ensures consistent quality.
2. **FDA Certification (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)**:
   * **Definition**: Approval required for food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices entering the U.S. market.
   * **Requirements**:
      * Compliance with FDA regulations.
      * Proper labeling and adherence to manufacturing standards (e.g., Good Manufacturing Practices - GMP).
   * **Importance**:
      * Ensures products are safe for U.S. consumers.
3. **CE Marking (European Union)**:
   * **Definition**: Mandatory for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA).
   * **Applicable Products**:
      * Machinery, electronics, medical devices, and toys.
   * **Importance**:
      * Signifies compliance with EU safety, health, and environmental standards.
4. **HALAL Certification**:
   * **Definition**: Certifies that products comply with Islamic dietary laws.
   * **Applicable Products**:
      * Food, beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.
   * **Importance**:
      * Essential for accessing markets in the Middle East and Muslim-majority countries.
5. **Fair Trade Certification**:
   * **Definition**: Ensures ethical sourcing, sustainable production, and fair wages.
   * **Applicable Products**:
      * Coffee, tea, chocolate, and textiles.
   * **Importance**:
      * Appeals to ethically conscious consumers, especially in Europe and North America.

# b. How to Obtain Export Certifications

1. **Identify Market-Specific Requirements**:
   * Research the regulations and certifications needed for the target country.

# 3. Challenges in Compliance and Standards

# a. Complex and Varied Standards

* Different countries have unique requirements, making compliance challenging.
* Example: EU requires CE marking, while the U.S. mandates FDA approval.

# b. High Costs

* Certification, testing, and inspections can be expensive for small exporters.

# c. Time-Consuming Process

* Certification and testing procedures often delay shipments.

# d. Constantly Changing Regulations

* Exporters must stay updated on evolving global standards and SPS measures.

# 4. Benefits of Product Compliance and Standards

1. **Market Access**:
   * Certifications open doors to international markets.
   * Example: CE marking enables access to the entire EU.
2. **Customer Trust**:
   * Compliance ensures product safety and quality, building consumer confidence.
3. **Competitive Advantage**:
   * Certified products often command higher prices and wider acceptance.
4. **Legal Protection**:
   * Reduces risks of legal disputes or penalties for non-compliance.

# 5. Best Practices for Exporters

1. **Research Target Market Requirements**:
   * Understand certifications and SPS measures specific to the importing country.
2. **Engage Experts**:
   * Work with certification bodies, customs brokers, and industry specialists.
3. **Implement Quality Management Systems**:
   * Adopt ISO or other internationally recognized frameworks.
4. **Stay Updated**:
   * Regularly monitor changes in global trade regulations and standards.
5. **Plan Ahead**:
   * Factor in the time and cost of obtaining certifications into the export timeline.

# Conclusion

Compliance with export product certifications and sanitary/phytosanitary measures is essential for successful international trade. Certifications like ISO, FDA, and CE marking ensure that products meet global quality and safety standards, while SPS measures protect human, animal, and plant health. By adhering to these standards, exporters can build trust, access new markets, and maintain a competitive edge.",1,1734937454.0,IndianExporters,0,1.0,False
1hkicmn,https://i.redd.it/gccis8hjrj8e1.png,How to prioritize your ingredient finders,"With the upcoming candy boost, I've had a hard time figuring out which of my ingredient specialists to level up - that dream shard penalty really screwed with my plans. So, with so many candidates, I had to figure out how to prioritize.

The table lists ingredient counts for the top two tiers of recipes. The ""totals"" are the average counts. The rows and columns are sorted by highest average counts. The biggest recipes are on the left side of the table. The ingredients with the highest requirements are on the top of the table. One way to pick would be to just go for the highest - that might suggest that Herbs (27 needed for corn curry) and Coffee (in the 3 largest recipes) are the ones with the most impact. But I decided to look at it in a different way.

The approach I took was to look for ingredient groupings that had synergies with recipes - in other words, the ingredients in the group overlap with the recipes they're in. I found two nice groupings.

*Green group: Soybeans, Leeks, and Mushrooms*
Recipes: ""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew, Ninja Salad, and Ninja Curry

Beans and mushrooms cover two of the four ingredients in Perk-Up Stew. All three cover three of the four ingredients in both Ninja Salad and Ninja Curry.

*Red group: Apples, Ginger, and Corn* 
Recipes: ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola, ""Teatime"" Corn Scones, and ""Calm Mind"" Fruit Salad

Apples and ginger are two of four ingredients in Spiced Cola. All are used in Corn Scones, leaving only milk. And apples and corn are two of the three ingredients in Fruit Salad.

So, if you are constrained by dream shards and aren't sure which of your ingredient specialists to boost, consider these groupings for impact across multiple recipes. Good luck this week!",9,1734937368.0,PokemonSleep,0,0.91,False

i'm a recent harvard phd grad (neuroscience) and served as an¬†**application reviewer / student interviewer**¬†for 2 years in my phd program. back when i applied, got in¬†10/10 phd programs and interviewed with over 50 PIs across all the schools. from these two experiences combined, i've gotten a pretty good sense of **what makes an interviewee stand out**.

you can read all of my advice in detail at [my phd applications guide blog](https://lucylai.com/blog/gradapps#interviews-the-fun-part), but here i will summarize some **major things we look** **for** in applicants at the interview stage, as well as **commonly asked interview questions**. to clarify, this advice / info mostly applies to **US STEM PhD programs that use admissions committees** (as opposed to directly admitting into a PI‚Äôs lab).

* **how admissions decisions are made.** while the exact formula for how applicants are ranked differs across schools, here‚Äôs a typical process:
   * each faculty member interviews **\~5-15 applicants** and scores them based on their **interview**  and **paper applications** (which are revisited in more detail)
   * **key factors** that we zone in on when revisiting your paper application:
      * **letters of recommendation**, especially from research advisors: do the letters highlight strong intellectual abilities, creativity, independence, passion, resilience, etc.?
      * **quantity and quality of your research experience**, as highlighted in your CV and SoP: how much research experience does the candidate have, and has their work resulted in outcomes (posters, talks, publications)?
   * **key factors** that we notice in interviews:
      * **scientific thinking**: does this candidate think like a scientist, or are they more of a technician? can this candidate engage in thoughtful scientific discussion and think on their feet?
      * **phd readiness**: does this candidate demonstrate the key traits of a successful phd student, including clarity of thought, drive / passion, resilience, leadership, and growth potential? can they handle the demands of a phd?
   * **applicants who stand out** are those with both a **deep understanding** of their own work and a **broad knowledge** of how it fits into the bigger picture of their field. they have a **clear vision** for what they want to pursue in their phd and why. they‚Äôre **genuinely enthusiastic** about science and **ask thoughtful questions** when learning about others‚Äô work. they can recount times when things went wrong in their research and how they **persevered** through it. they‚Äôre the kind of applicants that make me **wish the interview could go on longer**!
* **some common questions that we ask** in interviews to assess whether you possess the above qualities:
   * tell me about one of your favorite research projects / the one you‚Äôre most proud of.
   * what do you want to work on in your phd? 
   * can you describe a challenge you encountered in your research? how did you approach it / what did you learn?
   * if you were given an unlimited budget / resources, what‚Äôs an experiment you‚Äôd like to run / a research question you would pursue, and why? 
   * why this school?
   * let me tell you about my research...
   * do you have any questions about the program/school/etc.?

* **miscellaneous tips:**
   * practice your answers (do a lot of mock interviews!), but **try to not sound robotic**. this is a common pet peeve for many faculty.
   * **engage** the faculty with questions when they are telling you about their research, even if their work is unrelated to yours. they are (intentionally or not) assessing your curiosity and ability to hold a dynamic scientific conversation...i.e., whether they'd enjoy having you around as a colleague.
   * as interviewers, we sometimes over-index on extroversion. but even if you are naturally introverted or more reserved, **enthusiasm** goes a long way. i can't tell you how much it kills the vibe when the person i'm interviewing seems muted and uninterested in our conversation

there's a lot more i can say, but for now, ***ask me anything (AMA)*** about the phd interview process below! i will try to answer as best as i can :) ***i'm happy to keep answering questions for the next month, so ask anytime!***

The safe space my mom has provided me with this year truly made such a difference. I'm so grateful for this, and I understand that being my mom is in no way easy.

She had told me she had a boyfriend like two months after the separation. I was shocked. Although I love my dad, his and my mom's relationship was very unhealthy. Mostly due to him, especially the last two years. So I was confused as to why she'd want to date again so soon. I didn't say anything, I have trouble speaking up and I'm starting to feel like my mom's taking advantage of that.

Then she starts to spend weekends eith him etc. Again, she asked me and I said it was fine. I don't know why. I do feel like I'm partly at fault because I kept agreeing. It did hurt me that she seemed to want to escape her life with me.

In July she had a work event in a neighboring city. Her boyfriend was going to go with her,  but after they booked the hotel and everything he had a work thing come up. The situation ended in him going with her but leaving a few days early to go on his work trip. My mom then asked me if id like to join her and meet her boyfriend before he left. I said yes.

He's a chill guy. Literally can't find one thing wrong with this dude. He's not my kind of person, but I genuinely don't have an issue with him.

Anyways, the story goes on. I graduated high-school in June and decided to take a semester off. Like I mentioned beforehand, I struggle a lot with my mental health and graduating took me out. I was super depressed all summer, spending all day in bed, eating like shit and going to sleep at 4AM. All the support my mom could offer was suggestions on what I need to do. She still does this. I've explained to her that I know what I need to do, I just can't. That's my problem. I don't know if I'm out of touch, but I'd like for her to actively do things to help me.

Around this time my brother found out about her boyfriend because they bumped into each other. He so obviously didn't like my mom's boyfriend. My mom has complained about him being distant since around this time. No one's said anything to me but I think it's safe to assume this whole ordeal has strained their relationship.

In November I went on a trip I planned to see family that lived in another city for Thanksgiving. At first it was just me. Then my mom decided to join me. Yay! Then her boyfriend wanted to come and meet everyone. Mind you, my parents were bearly seprerated for a year at this point. Then he rented an Airbnb for him and my mom. My mom asked if it was okay, and because I'm a pushover I said it was fine. It was not fine.

During Thanksgiving dinner I was trying to get my mom to chill with me for a bit, but she didn't want to leave her boyfriend alone. She said he didn't know anyone. We had all just spent 5 days together. I'm sure he'll survive 40 minutes, less even. Admittedly I got really upset. When I get really upset in public, I quietly sit in a corner and disassociate until I feel better. So I went and did that. It for sure was wierd, but I don't care because a full on crash out is so much worse. After a bit my mom came to talk to me, I told her I didn't want to because we're in the middle of Thanksgiving so she left. I ate and tried my best to enjoy the day but when the desert i made turned out bad I lost it and ran away to the room I was sleeping in. I just lay there kinda crying. Eventually, my mom came in and again I told her I didn't wanna talk to her. Then, my aunt and uncle came in and they comforted me. I was fine in the short term, but honestly I stayed hella mad at my mom.

Because I planned my trip before them I left three days after them. When I got home, I was sick and so honestly I don't remember how but we were good. I still felt uneasy about everything.

She left five days later to go on a beach vacation she'd planned with her boyfriend. After about a week, I joined them and we all went to see more family. Her boyfriend payed for everything, if he didnt wed be back home. My plane landed yesterday, instantly I felt uneasy. We went to the Airbnb they had rented. It was the last night before we went to the town my family's in. I showered and I just couldn't stop crying, everything just felt so wrong.

I don't like their relationship. I don't like how my mom's changed. I feel like I'm a chore to her now. I don't like their dynamic. It reminds me of the couples in a high-school. It's cringe, and seeing my mom like this for the first time with this dude freaks me out. I don't like how quickly it all happened.

Today we woke up, went to get coffee and look at shops. My mom bought me a little ring because I was obviously upset the night before. It's sweet but it's starting to get bitter because it feels like hush money or something. Only because she never does much else, I am grateful don't get me wrong.

I tried so hard today. I really did. But I couldn't hold it in and by dinner I was doing my dissociate in a corner thing. She called him her husband and I don't know that just triggered me. At dinner it was obvious I was upset. I didn't talk, eat or look anyone in the eye. I hate it when I get like this. I know it's frustrating and being all emo like that is so embarrassing.  But I really can't help it. 

When we got to our Airbnb I went straight to my room to lay down. I knew I was really upset and didn't wanna, for lack of a better term, loose my shit. 

My mom came in, she asked me if I was mad at her and before I could stop myself I said yes. Everything id kept so carefully to myself came out. I was screaming and honestly being so mean to my mom. I told her I was uncomfortable with her relationship, especially how quickly everything was happening. I wish that was all I said. I told her basically everything I've written so far, along with telling her she was using this relationship to heal her broken marriage and that everything has felt off for months.

Her boyfriend heard everything, I'm embarrassed and genuinely sorry that I couldve just ruined something for him.

I don't know if I'm sorry or angry at my mom. I'm definitely distraught. It's Christmas, I'm far away from my dad and brother. 

So, AITAH for yelling and telling my mom I'm not comfortable with her relationship during a christmas trip that her boyfriend payed for?

If yes, genuinely, how can I do better? 

If no, what can I do?",5,1734937190.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I also drank coffee one particular night along with the 86% dark chocolate and within 30 min I felt this sense of impending doom while I was driving. That was 5 years ago.

Haven't touched the chocolate since then.
About 4 days ago, I decided to start eating it again. I'd only have a square off the block. First day of consuming it, I felt fine. Same with the second. The third I felt alright and today I felt my anxiety start getting out of control. So I am stopping.

I literally never had an issue with anxiety since that first time. Up until I started taking it again, I felt fine and my minor anxiety was perfectly manageable. I know the dark chocolate has caffeine and some other stimulant in it. Theobromine I think. But it takes my minor anxiety and cranks up the volume up near max. It's just so weird how certain foods can have that type of effect on a person.

PS, few other foods that will make that my anxiety sky rocket to the point of having a panic attack: apple cider vinegar, garlic and onions.

Support‚Äôs chillin‚Äô between $2.24 and $2.21, but it's flimsy. If XRP dares to dip below $1.94, we might enter the ""panic zone"" between $1.85 and $1.12. Not adorable, but hey, diamond hands always win, right?

On the flip, if $XRP flirts with $2.72 and actually commits, we could be *swiping up* toward that sweet rally life. Big moves could spark post-triangle action after that E-wave moment! Translation: XRP sipping coffee now, but it might hit tequila shots later.

First, I want to say hello and I want to thank you for deciding to read onwards. To start, I'd like to informally introduce myself, I'm Cheems and I'm looking forward to build a meaningful and genuine connection with someone who desires the same and intends to make it work. :)  
  
To tell you something about my past, I have dated people before, but have not been in an official relationship yet... WAIT-- NOT because I fear commitment, but because the people I dated effed up before we got there haha

Anyway, for some years, I abstained from dating because I got sick of spending my time and wasting it with the wrong people... but this year (or as the year is about to end) I have decided that I'm ready to give it a shot again and open my heart to someone who really deserves it.... By this, I mean someone who is also ready, committed, and interested to form a wholehearted, genuine and worthwhile relationship.   
  
And as to the pacing of this potential relationship, I'd prefer na slow burn. If we start to get to know each other, let us establish our expectations first and be good friends. Once we build the trust, we can meet up and hang out, and if we're really for each other, we can exclusively date.

Black Lagoon - Absolutely tops my knob.  Why this style isn't more commonplace is an actual crime.  
Ghost in the Shell - SAC/SAC2 are outstanding.  A little wordy and hard to watch with anyone that has the IQ of a coffee table.  The newer stuff has been disappointing.  
Cowboy Bebop - Serviceable, but got a little dry at the end.  Vicious just wasn't a compelling villain TBH.  
Gundam - Wing broke my anime cherry, rewatches feel a bit silly 25 years later.  08th MS Team holds my title for favorite in the franchise.  
Zoids - NCZ was probably only held together by the VO cast, CC was hardly worth the time.  
Hellsing - Saw the OVA early on, then Ultimate much later.  Completely overshadowed by the Abridged.  
SAO - Also overshadowed by the Abridged.  
Outlaw Star - This one doesn't owe anyone anything.  Stands well on its own and sets itself apart from almost everything else.  Not perfect, but a guilty pleasure.  
Robotech - Cool robots ruined by a fucking awful VO cast.  Doubt it sounds much better in Japanese.  
Initial D - Great detail-oriented action and direction interspersed with dull teenagers mumbling to each other.  
Full Metal Alchemist - Nothing wrong with it, just never stood out for me.  Binged it once and it did pretty much everything right.  It's not FMA, it's me.  I remember watching Brotherhood, too, but so many years have come between me and this anime.  Maybe I'll watch it again and see if I have a different opinion now.  
Inuyasha - Just bang already.  
Bleach - Probably how [https://tvtropes.org/](https://tvtropes.org/) started.  Someone wrote down a formula on a napkin and then said ""This, 300 times"".  I couldn't make it through 10 ten episodes.

He let one of his friends stay in our house with his girlfriend (they both still live with their parents)
I had no problem with them staying over. I even put snacks, coffee, tea etc for them to consume.

My husband had to come back for some urgent work back home, and asked me to come with and we'll return back to my parents house after 3 days. I agreed and he informed his friend that we're coming over and he should leave and can return once we're gone. So I didn't pack any clothes for us, because I thought I would have access to my place.

We arrive home, and they're still in the house, not answering our messages or phone calls. 
We wait by my mother in law's house. Two hours later, he asks if he can stay till the night. 

The only available place to now relax is the storage room with a guest bed at my mother in law's house with the most filthiest toilet, boxes everywhere..even on the bed. There's barely any space to move around. 

I ask my husband, ""Can't we just ask them to leave?""
And he flips, he says I'm unkind, unwilling to help others and I can't even sacrifice even a little bit. He made me feel like a crappy human for wanting them to leave. Despite them having their own houses and they were even a warning that we're coming..

It hurt, but I kept quiet because I'm 7 months pregnant and I do NOT want to use my energy to fight. 

He apologized 30 minutes later, but still suggested we rest here in the storage room.

Night fall comes, and his friend gives a terrible terrible excuse (he can't go home because he had a fight with his brother) but he'll leave tomorrow morning.

I'm thinking, ""So he can meet his brother tomorrow morning but not tonight...okkkkkkkaaaay that's a bit.....weird""

I let it slide, and spent a restless night in the storage room. But now I'm really thinking..... am I really the asshole for wanting to sleep in OUR OWN HOUSE?",36,1734935670.0,AITH,41,0.92,False

Which is cute but I thought moot point.  He gonna have to buy the coffee anyway. But  then I thought  how many cups of coffee is $11,000

Is Alex gonna be rich?

I did standard business planning math backing into the numbers with cost of goods.

Jason was building 5 shops with 110 employees and $107k a month of  sales and ~$20k a month net profit.

Then I did start up costs figuring he would put his shops in existing malls and high end strip malls.

His start up capital was about $350k. $250k more if he bought plots and built stand alone shops.

That's a lot of money to put on the table and a lot of work to make a $250k take home salary.

1hkhwtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_storypalette/comments/1hkhwtu/strings_of_fate/,Strings of Fate,"It was a cold, rain-slick night when I first saw the violin. The neon glow of the pawnshop‚Äôs sign caught my eye as I trudged home, defeated, after another failed audition. The weight of my violin case felt heavier than usual, as though it knew I‚Äôd let it down again.

I‚Äôd passed the pawnshop a hundred times before, its window cluttered with forgotten treasures and broken dreams. But tonight, something drew me closer. There, nestled among dusty trinkets and tarnished jewelry, was a violin.

It wasn‚Äôt remarkable at first glance‚Äîdark wood, scuffed edges, strings taut and slightly dulled. But the longer I looked, the more it seemed to glow, faintly, as if lit from within. I couldn‚Äôt look away. My reflection in the shop window seemed to shimmer, the violin‚Äôs shadow curling around me like smoke.

Before I knew it, I was inside, handing over the last of my cash to the clerk, who didn‚Äôt even bother to haggle. ‚ÄúYou sure you want this one?‚Äù he asked, his voice low and uneasy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been here a long time. People don‚Äôt keep it for long.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure,‚Äù I said, though I didn‚Äôt feel sure of anything.

When I brought it home, I set my own violin aside and lifted the new one from its worn case. The wood was cool under my fingers, the strings humming faintly as I tuned them. It felt alive, as though it had been waiting for me.

When I played the first note, the sound filled the room like liquid gold. It was richer, deeper than anything I‚Äôd ever coaxed from my old instrument. My hands moved effortlessly, the melodies pouring out as if the violin itself was guiding me. I lost track of time, playing until the first light of dawn crept through the curtains.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the first change.

The audition I‚Äôd been dreading that morning‚Äîone I‚Äôd convinced myself I‚Äôd ruin like all the others‚Äîwas different. The moment I began to play, the room fell silent, the judges transfixed. The music flowed like it did in my apartment, as though the violin had a mind of its own.

By the time I finished, I could see it in their eyes: awe, admiration, hunger. I didn‚Äôt just pass the audition. I owned it.

From that day on, everything started to change. The gigs got bigger, the audiences more rapturous. My name started appearing on posters, whispered in conversations. The violin became my constant companion, its haunting melodies weaving their way into every performance, every moment of my life.

But with each success came a price.

The first time I noticed, it was small. A call I forgot to return, a friend I didn‚Äôt meet for coffee. The violin demanded my time, my energy, pulling me away from the world.

Then there were the dreams. Vivid, unsettling visions of places I‚Äôd never been, people I‚Äôd never met. A woman with dark eyes, her fingers gliding across the violin‚Äôs strings in a dimly lit room. A crowd of faceless figures watching, their applause a deafening roar.

I tried to ignore it, but the violin wouldn‚Äôt let me. When I wasn‚Äôt playing, it called to me, its strings vibrating faintly in the stillness. It was always there, a shadow in my mind, an itch I couldn‚Äôt scratch.

One night, after a particularly grueling performance, I set the violin down and stepped away, determined to put some distance between us. But as I turned, I heard a faint whisper, low and melodic.

**Play.**

The word wasn‚Äôt spoken‚Äîit was felt, a vibration in my chest, an ache in my hands. I turned back, my pulse quickening. The violin was glowing faintly again, the same way it had in the pawnshop window.

I couldn‚Äôt resist.

The moment my fingers touched the strings, I was lost. The melody that poured forth was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever played‚Äîhaunting, sorrowful, beautiful. It wasn‚Äôt mine. It was hers.

The dreams became clearer after that. The woman in the dark room. The faceless crowd. A man with sharp features and cold eyes, handing her the violin with a knowing smile.

And then, her screams.

I woke in a sweat, the violin‚Äôs glow still faintly visible in the corner of the room. That‚Äôs when I realized the truth. This instrument wasn‚Äôt just enchanted‚Äîit was cursed. It had belonged to her, the woman in my dreams, her soul trapped within its strings.

Now, it was mine. And I could feel it pulling me deeper, threading itself into the fabric of my life. The successes weren‚Äôt mine‚Äîthey were its. The haunting melodies weren‚Äôt from my heart‚Äîthey were from hers.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop. The violin wouldn‚Äôt let me.

Each performance brought more applause, more fame, but also more whispers in the dark, more of that insistent pull. I tried to resist, to put it down, but every time I did, the world seemed to dim, my fingers itching for its touch.

Now, as I sit here in the glow of the stage lights, the crowd roaring in the distance, I know what‚Äôs coming. The violin‚Äôs strings hum softly, vibrating in tune with my heartbeat. It owns me now, just as it owned her.

And when the time comes, I know it will move on to the next player, leaving me behind in its wake, another soul caught in its eternal song.",1,1734935501.0,u_storypalette,0,1.0,False

Whether you‚Äôre looking for a plumber to fix a leak, an electrician to install new lights, or even a personal trainer to help with your fitness goals, finding the right service provider quickly can make all the difference. Local advertisements have become an invaluable tool for people seeking immediate help and reliable service providers. But how do you sift through the noise and find the best ads for the services you need? In this article, we‚Äôll explore how to make the most of local ads, how to identify trustworthy services, and what to look for to ensure you get quality, value, and convenience.

# 1. Understanding the Power of Local Ads

Before diving into how to find the best local ads, it‚Äôs essential to understand why local advertising is so crucial today. Local ads serve a distinct purpose‚Äîthey connect people with service providers in their immediate area, making them highly relevant and actionable.

# What Are Local Ads?

Local ads are advertisements that focus on specific geographic areas, usually targeting people who live or work in that locality. These ads can come in various forms, including:

* **Classifieds** (online or in print)
* **Flyers and posters** in neighborhoods
* **Local newspapers and magazines**
* **Social media ads targeting specific regions**
* **Search engine ads** using location-based targeting

These ads help businesses and service providers reach out to people who are most likely to need their services, whether for a one-time project or ongoing assistance.

# Why Are Local Ads Effective?

Local ads offer several key advantages for both consumers and businesses:

* **Proximity**: The service provider is nearby, meaning they can respond quickly to inquiries or emergencies.
* **Personalized service**: Local businesses tend to offer more tailored services that cater to the unique needs of their communities.
* **Cost-effectiveness**: Local ads often cost less to produce and distribute, which means service providers can offer competitive prices.

Local ads help you tap into a pool of professionals who understand your neighborhood and the specific challenges it may present. This can make a big difference in the quality of the service you receive.

# 2. Types of Services You Can Find in Local Ads

Local ads cover a broad spectrum of services, catering to nearly every need imaginable. The range of services you can find through local advertising is vast, and it‚Äôs likely that whatever you're looking for is right at your fingertips.

# Home Improvement Services

One of the most common areas where local ads shine is in home improvement. Whether you're looking to renovate your kitchen, paint your living room, or fix a broken window, you can find qualified professionals in your area who specialize in:

* **Plumbing**: Leak repair, drain cleaning, pipe installation, and more.
* **Electrical**: Wiring, circuit repair, lighting installations, and electrical inspections.
* **Carpentry and Flooring**: Floor installation, custom woodwork, cabinetry, and trim work.
* **Roofing and Siding**: Roof repairs, replacements, and siding installations.

Local ads often feature home improvement contractors who have a solid understanding of the local building codes and environmental conditions, which can be crucial for the success of your project.

# Health and Wellness Services

Health and wellness is another category where local ads play a significant role. These services often require trust, so finding the right provider in your community can make all the difference. Some examples include:

* **Personal Trainers**: Offering personalized workout plans and fitness programs.
* **Yoga and Pilates Instructors**: Providing private or group classes for various skill levels.
* **Nutritionists and Dietitians**: Offering expert advice on healthy eating and meal planning.
* **Massage Therapists**: Helping with relaxation, stress relief, and injury recovery.

These types of services are highly localized because personal health care often requires face-to-face interaction and a high level of trust. Local ads can help you find a provider whose philosophy aligns with your needs.

# Automotive Services

For many people, their vehicles are an essential part of daily life. Local ads help car owners find convenient and reliable automotive services such as:

* **Mechanics**: For repairs, maintenance, and diagnostics.
* **Auto Detailers**: For washing, waxing, and interior cleaning.
* **Tire Services**: Including tire changes, rotations, and balancing.
* **Car Washes**: Local businesses offering quick and affordable car washes.

Because auto repairs are often time-sensitive, local ads allow you to find nearby professionals who can respond quickly to your needs.

# Event Planning and Catering Services

Whether you're hosting a birthday party, wedding, or corporate event, finding local vendors who can cater to your specific needs is crucial. Local ads can connect you with:

* **Event Planners**: Professionals who can help coordinate your event, from decoration to guest management.
* **Catering Services**: Offering a wide variety of cuisines for all types of events.
* **Photographers and Videographers**: To capture the memories of your special day.
* **Party Rentals**: Providing chairs, tables, linens, and even bounce houses.

Local ads for event planning services help ensure that your event is seamless and perfectly tailored to your preferences.

# Childcare and Elder Care Services

For families with young children or elderly relatives, finding reliable caregivers is a top priority. Local ads are an excellent way to connect with:

* **Nannies and Babysitters**: Offering short-term or long-term child care services.
* **Senior Care Providers**: Assisting with daily living activities and health care.
* **Tutors**: For academic support, language lessons, and skill development.

These ads typically feature individuals who are nearby, which is important for trust and ease of communication.

# 3. How to Find the Best Local Ads

Now that you know the wide range of services you can access through local ads, it‚Äôs time to learn how to find the best ones. Here are a few strategies for discovering trustworthy local services:

# 1. Search Online Classifieds

Many online platforms allow users to browse local ads for services. Searching through these platforms can be an excellent way to find a wide variety of options. When using online classifieds, be sure to:

* **Look for verified reviews**: Many online classifieds allow users to leave feedback on services. Check for reviews that highlight the quality and reliability of the provider.
* **Narrow your search by location**: Use filters to find services that are closest to you. Proximity is often key when it comes to timely service.

# 2. Use Social Media Ads and Recommendations

Social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, offer location-based ads that can connect you with local service providers. Additionally, many social platforms have groups and communities where members share recommendations for local businesses. Engaging in these groups can give you insight into who offers the best service in your area.

# 3. Check Local Directories and Listings

Local directories and listings are often a goldmine for finding nearby services. Websites like community boards, local event pages, and online city guides often feature classified ads for local services. These ads tend to be more detailed and often include promotions, deals, and contact information for businesses in your area.

# 4. Ask Friends and Family

One of the most reliable ways to find great local services is by asking for recommendations from friends and family. If someone you trust has had a positive experience with a service provider, there's a good chance you will too. Recommendations can save you time and effort in sifting through ads that might not meet your expectations.

# 5. Visit Local Businesses

Sometimes the best way to find local ads is simply to explore your community. Many small businesses still use traditional methods, such as posting flyers in local coffee shops, libraries, and community centers. These businesses might not be as visible online but can offer great services. Keep an eye out for bulletin boards or printed ads when you‚Äôre out and about in your neighborhood.

# 4. Evaluating Local Ads and Services

Once you‚Äôve found several local ads for services, it‚Äôs essential to evaluate them to ensure you're making the right choice. Here are a few tips for evaluating local ads:

# 1. Verify Credentials and Experience

The best service providers should be transparent about their experience and credentials. Look for ads that provide clear information about the company or individual‚Äôs background, licenses, and certifications. You can also check their websites (if available) for testimonials, past projects, or any industry affiliations that speak to their professionalism.

# 2. Assess Reviews and Reputation

A reputable service provider will have a solid reputation within the community. Take the time to read reviews, either on social media, Google, or third-party review sites. Pay attention to comments regarding reliability, punctuality, and the quality of work.

# 3. Compare Pricing

While pricing isn‚Äôt always the most important factor, it‚Äôs still essential to compare rates. Some service providers may offer promotions or discounts in local ads, making their services more affordable. However, always ensure that low prices don‚Äôt come at the expense of quality.

# 4. Contact Multiple Providers

Before making a final decision, contact a few service providers from the ads you‚Äôve found. This will give you a sense of their communication style, professionalism, and willingness to address your specific needs. It's also an opportunity to ask about availability, pricing, and any additional services they may offer.

# 5. Conclusion

Local ads are a powerful tool for finding the services you need, whether it‚Äôs for home improvement, health, automotive repairs, event planning, or more. By utilizing the strategies discussed in this article, you can quickly and efficiently connect with trustworthy service providers in your area. Remember, the key to finding the best service through local ads is to do your research, read reviews, and ask for recommendations.",1,1734934740.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

1hkhpvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1hkhpvw/do_i_even_have_gastritis_im_feeling_pretty/,Do I even have gastritis? I'm feeling pretty hopeless,"My main symptoms started around September. It was not until November that I got my ""gastritis"" diagnosis, that being said it was only classified as mild. Honestly, I've lost a lot of weight and at this point am getting desparate. They said that some ""muscle"" is not closing properly which leads to more reflux getting into my stomach.

Not to mention I had a gastroscopy done on me 4 years ago (I am 31 now) and back then I was (mostly) symptom free and back then they also said I have ""mild gastritis"" but not to worry if it does not cause any symptoms.

**Here is how my life was before the symptoms began:**

* No alcohol/cigarattes
* Daily 1 espresso with milk.
* I would say above average healthy food. Most of it was home cooked.
* Reflux during the night for all my life. The main issue I had from it was a sore throat. Went undiagnosed for 26 years. Then I started (occasionally taking Anti Reflux before bed and my throat got better).
* Other than that I lived really care free when it comes to food & drink. I just avoided  heavy foods for dinner because I noticed I had a hard time sleeping afterwards.

**Here are the symptoms I've had in the past couple years/months before my ""sickness"" began:**

* I would wake up in the morning hours \~4 am with a burning (similar to strong hunger) sensation in my stomach. I would need to shift position to a different one so my stomach calms down.
* In the past 4 years I had periods (especially after sweet foods) where I needed to abstain from sweets for a few weeks to recover. Nausea.
* Tested NEGATIVE on h.pylori and Sibo in the last 4 months (while I already had symptoms).

**Here is how my life is currently:**

* I've completely removed coffee/alcohol/tea. Fat or Sugar from my diet.
* Currently I am eating the blandest of the bland: Rice, Cooked Potatoes, Some cooked Vegetables and (spelt) noodles. No Salt, nothing!
* I am taking 2x PPI (40mg) per day (before breakfast / dinner)
* I am taking anti reflux pills (to suck on) around noon or night to prevent issues during the night
* I sleep on an inclined bed, I avoid lying down after eating, I eat dinner 4 hours before going to bed
* I have at least one flare up per week no matter what I do

**Here is what I learned during about my stomach**

* Before the PPI, when my stomach was ""flared up"" even the simplest things like a TEA or even the anti reflux medication would cause massive bloating and nausea. (But since starting PPIs I did not have such strong flare ups anymore)
* I have either a) bloating&nausea directly after a meal or b) nausea during the night / next morning. For a) it is easy to determine and say ""this food was not ideal for me"" but for b) I am at a loss. I don't know what to do about it and how it even is triggered. It seems not to matter what I eat in the evening.

On paper I am doing everything right that I can be doing.....yet I still feel sick / nauseous most of the time. Nothing seems to help. Ironically I do tend to periodically, randomly have good days in between. That's the perverse part! Sometimes I eat ham & cheese and feel better (maybe slightly bloated) than on other days after eating only bland foods.

But even though I have been struggling for 4 months now I have no yet found a diet, no matter how bland, that makes me feel ""ok"". I've tried many things over the months and it does not seem to matter what I eat (within bounds, fatty food will most likely trigger it).

I don't even can say that the PPI is helping me at all. Except for the fact that it made the flare ups a little less intense it did not really change anything.

Yesterday I had nothing but plain rice for dinner and cooked potatoes/vegetables during the day. Afterwards dinner, I still felt nausea for a couple hours. 5 hours later went to bed feeling hungry, just to wake up after only 3 hours (!) with nausea yet again.

Like...where do I go from here? Nothing I do gives me relief, nothing I eat seems to be accepted by my stomach. I guess I need to change doctors and pray. But really.....can anybody even tell me whether this can be explained by gastritis? I mean the severity of it and it being so god damn not consistent.",1,1734934684.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False

Anyone here have similar experience? I find that the nicotine helps me focus at work during the day, but not worth it if it is likely causing this sleep hell. Thanks.",1,1734934597.0,Nicotine,0,1.0,False
