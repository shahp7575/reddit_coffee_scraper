""I left my peaceful village to go to the city with the hope of changing my life. Or at least to find a job that could support myself and help my parents take care of my two siblings who are still in school. But that hope gradually faded, as it has been nearly a month since I came to the city. As a country boy with no degree or any connections or relatives here, of course, I couldn't get a decent job.

Until today, while sitting absentmindedly at a roadside cafe thinking about my murky future, a man approached me from out of nowhere. He looked at the portfolio in my hand and asked softly:

'Are you... looking for a job, young man?'

'Yes...' I answered listlessly with a face full of despair.

He looked at me for a few seconds and then asked:

'The security guard at my place just quit. Do you want to be a security guard?'

Like a drowning person grabbing a lifebuoy, I said excitedly:

'Yes... I do! Is your place nearby?'

'Just across the street! Want to go now?'

I nodded and hastily asked for the bill, then followed him into the small alley opposite. The alley was very narrow, just enough for a motorbike to pass through, and it was very deserted. I felt a pang of unease and urged:

'Are we there yet, sir?'

He stopped and said simply:

'We're here!'

'Here?' I was surprised.

In front of me was an old iron gate, with a surveillance camera mounted above. Behind the gate was a staircase with worn-out tiled steps. I took a few steps back and looked up. Under the scorching midday sun, many regularly spaced windows appeared before my eyes.

'This looks like an apartment building... and it seems to have been built a long time ago!' I thought to myself and asked the man:

'Are you the owner here, sir?'

'No, I'm just the manager!' he shook his head.

Seeing my hesitation, he asked:

'What do you think, young man?'

Honestly, I was a bit hesitant at that moment. The feeling here was very strange and unexplainable. But then I thought about the money in my pocket, which was almost gone. If I couldn't find a job today, I would surely have to pack up and go back home. 'I can't. What will I say to my family if I go back now? My parents borrowed money for me to come here to start a new life. How can I give up so easily!' I made up my mind, nodded, and said:

'When can I start working, sir?'

He said in a calm voice:

'Come here at 11 p.m. tonight, and I'll hand over the job!'

I nodded, thanked him, and left, my heart filled with joy that I had finally found a job to continue living in this bustling but also glamorous city. But I didn't know that it was just the beginning of a series of bizarre days that I would probably never forget for the rest of my life...

...

I stepped out of the house, looking as neat and presentable as possible for my first day of work. My heart was both happy and nervous, and I walked quickly on the street that was gradually becoming less crowded, with shops on both sides having almost closed down. Luckily, the alley where I worked was not far from my rented room, only about a 10-minute walk. Looking at my watch, it was only 10:30 p.m., so I stopped by a water stall that hadn't closed yet to buy a cup of coffee and then crossed the street to enter the same alley from the morning.

This alley was deserted during the day, but at night, it looked much scarier. It was very dark, with almost no streetlights except for a little light spilling from the nearby houses. I felt a little uneasy. Dark places like this are often where robberies happen, or at least where junkies and addicts hang out, asking for money. Thinking about having to walk through here every day, I suddenly felt discouraged.

'Did I... just see someone?'

At the corner of the alley, a young man was sitting silently in a dark corner, staring at me with cloudy, unblinking eyes. 'Oh, damn, why am I so unlucky!' I muttered to myself, sweating profusely at the sight of him. He was wearing a grayish-brown shirt and torn denim shorts, his body was skinny, and his face was gaunt as if he had been starved for a long time.

I walked away quickly. I kept glancing back behind me. Fortunately, he didn't follow. But I seemed to feel his eyes still watching my every move.

Sighing with relief, I finally arrived at my workplace. The iron gate was still closed, and the manager from the morning was nowhere to be seen.

'Sir... excuse me, I'm here to start work!'

I was flustered as I suddenly remembered that I didn't even know his name. How could I have been so careless! I waited for a moment, then called out again, but still, no one opened the door. It was almost 11 p.m., and my mind started to have thoughts like... maybe I was scammed? Who would hire an employee just by talking like this? And why would he scam a nobody like me, with only a few dollars in my pocket?

While I was feeling confused, a child's voice suddenly rang out right behind me:

'Who are you looking for, sir?'

I turned around, and it was a boy about 7 or 8 years old with big, black eyes. His whole body was covered in sweat and dirt, and he was holding a red leather ball. I asked him:

'I'm waiting for the manager here. Have you seen him, kid?'

The boy shook his head, then continued to run and play around in front.

'Why aren't you home sleeping at this hour? Where do you live?' I asked.

The boy stopped, panting, and replied:

'I'm waiting for my dad to come home. I live here!'

He pointed his hand at the iron gate behind me. So he was also a resident of this apartment building. Exactly at 11 p.m., the iron gate suddenly opened. Hearing its heavy creaking sound, I suddenly felt a shiver.

'Sorry to have kept you waiting, young man!'

Oh my god, so he was inside all this time. Why didn't he answer me earlier? Or maybe he didn't hear me calling? I forced a smile, even though I was a little annoyed:

'Yes... no problem, sir!'

'Come in!'

He gestured for me to go into the room right next to the stairs. I instinctively turned around to look at the boy, but he was no longer there. I thought his dad must have come to pick him up, so I didn't pay any more attention to it...

The manager introduced himself as Tan. The job was surprisingly simple. I just had to sit in one place and watch the cameras to monitor people coming and going. At 3 a.m., I had to take a walk around the building to check things, and then return to the camera room until the end of my shift. He then gave me two uniforms, a flashlight, a large bunch of building keys, a walkie-talkie, and said that the walkie-talkie was only for contacting him in an emergency, and it had no other function because I was the only security guard in the whole apartment complex.

After giving me the instructions, Tan asked:

'Do you have any other questions?'

'I just want to ask how many floors this apartment building has?'

'Only three floors. How does that sound?' Tan smiled.

'Piece of cake, sir!' I replied with a smile.

Tan said goodbye and left. He walked, so his house must be nearby. Left alone, I started to get used to the job by looking at each camera screen and memorizing its location. Fortunately, each screen had the floor number displayed on it and was arranged very logically, so it didn't take me long.

It's true that every job has its own difficulties. And the first difficulty of this job was... how to not fall asleep. Indeed, several hours had passed, but I didn't know what to do other than stare at the empty screens. Sooner or later, sleepiness began to creep in. Looking at my watch, it was almost 1 a.m. At this hour, there were probably no more people coming or going. I checked the door, then set an alarm for 3 a.m. just in case I fell asleep.

My eyelids were getting heavy, and the cup of coffee I bought earlier was all gone. I wearily rested my head on the table. The air conditioner continuously blew a cool breeze in the hot summer weather, making my body feel even more relaxed, and I fell asleep without even knowing it...

...

The echoing, creepy laughter of a child woke me up like a spring. For a second, my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest before I fumbled for my phone and turned it off.

'Oh my god, I forgot to change the ringtone...'

I mumbled to myself, then lazily got up and stretched my limbs. It was time to go check the building. A quick glance at the camera screens showed that everything seemed fine. I tucked the walkie-talkie into my belt and stepped out of the surveillance room.

My footsteps echoed throughout the apartment corridor. The hallway lights were almost all off. The clearest light came from the flashlight in my hand. Each floor had about 10 apartments, and the stairs were right next to the wall. This meant that after checking one floor, I had to go back to take the stairs to the next floor. It seemed a bit inconvenient, but I didn't mind much, I just considered it as checking twice in one trip.

The first and second floors were nothing strange, all the doors were closed. When I got to the third floor, it was a little different from the two floors below, this floor had 11 rooms. At the end of the hall, there was an iron sliding door, and behind it were stairs leading up, probably to the rooftop.

'Do I need to check the rooftop?'

I tried to use the keys, but none of them seemed to open the door. While I was fumbling, a whirring sound suddenly rang out right next to my ear. I was startled and turned to see an elevator going up right next to the iron door. Maybe it was too dark on this floor, so I didn't see it.

'Why didn't Tan tell me there was an elevator here?'

The elevator stopped right on the third floor. I don't know why I felt so nervous and anxious. Only a few seconds passed, but it felt so long, like I was watching a slow-motion movie. The door slowly opened...

There was no one inside. The elevator was pitch black, with only a strange greenish light coming from a small neon light attached above.

'Who would install a light of this color? Are they trying to scare people?' I grimaced.

In the right corner, there was a small camera mounted next to the light bulb. I tried to rack my brain, but I couldn't remember if any screen in the surveillance room was connected to this camera.

A cold gust of wind suddenly blew past me, giving me goosebumps. The elevator door slowly closed, and then it stopped completely. Everything became quiet again as if nothing had happened.

I hurriedly picked up the walkie-talkie to call Tan, but then I remembered that he was probably asleep at this hour. Not wanting to disturb his sleep, I decided to wait until tomorrow to ask him.

Walking down the stairs, the surveillance room was only a few steps away when from behind, a red leather ball rolled down, making heavy thudding sounds. It was the ball of the little boy from earlier. Was he still awake at this hour?

I looked up but only saw the deep blackness of the darkness. Picking up the ball, I thought for a moment, then took it into the room and put it in a corner, planning to find the boy in the morning to return it...

...

It was 3:30 a.m., which meant I had spent about half an hour on this patrol. It was quite fast, I guess. I plopped down on the chair, leaned back, my eyes dull and bloodshot from sleepiness. I suddenly remembered the camera in the elevator, so I checked all the screens in front of me again. There really was no screen connected to that camera. Maybe... it was broken?

Bored with thinking, I just gave up on everything because my eyes were getting stuck together. I set the alarm for 5 a.m., rested my head on the table, and planned to get a little more sleep to clear my head. But after only about 5 minutes of dozing off, I was startled awake by the cold. I fumbled around to find the remote to turn off the air conditioner, with my eyes barely open.

'That's strange, I can't find the remote?'

I searched every corner of the room but still couldn't find it. I wearily looked up at the air conditioner to see if there was a switch or something to turn it off. But... I discovered something incredibly terrifying about this room that I hadn't realized until now. This room... didn't have an air conditioner.""",1,1758816642.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

From Hotel Lobbies to Hidden Libraries: Where New Yorkers Find Their Third Workplaces



On a weekday morning in Midtown, the lobby of the Ace Hotel hums with a particular kind of focus. Suits and sneakers mingle as freelancers and founders balance cortados next to MacBooks. In New York, the third workplace isn’t a curiosity—it’s a survival tactic.



For those who know where to look, the city reveals an atlas of alternatives. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library, just off Fifth Avenue, offers light-filled study rooms with skyline views. Uptown, the Hungarian Pastry Shop is more than a café; it’s a Columbia institution where laptops compete for space with leather-bound books. Downtown, members of the design set gravitate toward hotel lounges like The Ludlow or Public, where the soft jazz soundtrack pairs as well with a Zoom call as with an evening cocktail.



In a city so defined by square footage, New Yorkers have long mastered the art of carving out territory. Third workplaces here aren’t about free WiFi alone—they’re about energy, proximity, and the sense that you’re working within the flow of the city itself.

London



Beyond the Pub: London’s Quiet Evolution of Third Workplaces



If the pub has always been London’s “third place,” then the pandemic quietly rewrote the script. Today, a different network is threading through the capital—third workplaces where professionals slip between heritage and modernity.



Step into the British Library and the reading rooms still carry the hush of scholarship, yet the presence of laptops signals a new era. In the East End, Town Hall Hotel has become an insider’s haunt: a soaring lobby where entrepreneurs edit pitch decks over oat flat whites, punctuated by the sound of keys clicking beneath Art Deco chandeliers. Along the Thames, Tate Modern offers not just culture but corners of respite—the café terrace, overlooking St. Paul’s, doubles as one of the city’s most atmospheric workstations.



Londoners choose these spaces for more than practicality. They are places where history and design intersect with productivity, where working feels less like obligation and more like belonging to a wider urban rhythm. The city may still love its pubs, but its third workplaces are where tomorrow’s ideas quietly take root.

Paris



Aesthetic Cafés, Cultural Hubs, and Third Places for Work in Paris



In Paris, the café table has always been a stage. Writers, philosophers, and revolutionaries sharpened ideas over tiny cups of espresso. Today, the stage is subtly reimagined: the café is joined by galleries, libraries, and hotel lounges as new third workplaces for a laptop generation.



On the Left Bank, La REcyclerie—a former train station—mixes sustainability with style, where long wooden tables are as inviting for laptops as they are for communal lunches. In the Marais, the Bibliothèque Forney, housed in a 16th-century mansion, offers hushed corners beneath painted beams. Meanwhile, the Hoxton Paris has turned its courtyard café into one of the city’s most photogenic workplaces, with ivy climbing the walls and conversations shifting from English to French in an instant.



To work in Paris is to take part in its rhythm of beauty and conversation. Third workplaces here are not escapes from the city—they are extensions of it. They remind us that work, even in its digital form, can still be social, sensual, and distinctly Parisian.



⸻



San Francisco



With a View: The Bay Area’s Third Workplace Culture



San Francisco’s work culture has always blurred lines—between home and office, code and counterculture. Now the city’s laptop generation is reclaiming another frontier: where to work outside of both.



Step into the lobby of the Proper Hotel on Market Street and you’ll see the shift. Velvet banquettes hold entrepreneurs in AirPods, while terrazzo tables balance both cappuccinos and laptops. Across town, the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park has become a quiet favorite—its outdoor benches a place where founders swap Slack for sunlight. Over in Oakland, the Fox Theater’s adjacent cafés attract creatives who’d rather storyboard their next film than refresh their inbox.



Here, the third workplace isn’t just about WiFi—it’s about view and vibe. A rooftop terrace with the Bay Bridge glinting in the distance or a sunlit corner overlooking Dolores Park gives the workday a certain grandeur. In San Francisco, productivity has always been tethered to vision; it’s no surprise that its third workplaces come with perspective built in.



⸻



Los Angeles



Creative Third Places in LA: From Instagrammable Cafés to Quiet Corners



Los Angeles doesn’t just stage movies; it stages its workday. Remote workers here know that every detail—the right natural light, a well-placed palm, even the playlist—shapes how an afternoon unfolds.



In Silver Lake, Dinosaur Coffee draws the city’s writers and indie founders, its geometric ceilings and mid-century chairs as photogenic as the lattes. West Hollywood’s San Vicente Bungalows aren’t laptop havens but remind us of LA’s duality: work and leisure overlap in every space. For those seeking quiet, the Getty Center’s sculpture gardens offer perhaps the city’s most contemplative “desk,” where meetings happen on benches surrounded by bougainvillea. And in Santa Monica, the Proper Hotel’s airy lobby balances ocean breeze with reliable outlets—a combination that feels pure California.



The city’s third workplaces lean toward the cinematic. They invite workers to inhabit scenes where creativity feels not only possible but inevitable. In LA, the setting isn’t background—it’s part of the script.



⸻ 



Washington DC



Laptop-Friendly Spots in the Capital: DC’s Policy-Minded Third Workplaces



Washington’s third workplaces are as layered as its politics. Here, every space carries subtext: who you might bump into, what deal could be struck, how the atmosphere frames ambition.



The atrium at the Eaton DC hotel has quietly become a nexus—plants spilling from balconies, jazz humming in the background, and policy wonks editing decks between calls. Across town, the Library of Congress remains the city’s most dignified workplace, its neoclassical dome towering over laptops and legal pads alike. For something more discreet, the café at Planet Word, a museum devoted to language, offers quiet tables where Hill staffers and grad students share power strips.



DC’s third workplaces thrive on this tension between openness and discretion. They’re places where ideas percolate in public yet maintain the intimacy of private exchange. In the capital, even the choice of where to open a laptop can feel like a political act.



⸻



Dubai



Luxury and Light: Dubai’s Distinctive Third Workplaces



In Dubai, scale often steals the spotlight. But amid the skyscrapers and spectacle, a quieter current is emerging—third workplaces that prize elegance, ease, and light.



Step into the lobby of the Jumeirah Emirates Towers, and you’ll find a new type of daytime rhythm: consultants in linen jackets drafting notes beneath crystal chandeliers, while soft Arabic lounge music threads through the air. The Dubai Opera Garden Café, overlooking the Burj Khalifa, is another insider’s pick—where morning coffee flows into late-afternoon productivity. For a more grounded pace, Alserkal Avenue, the city’s contemporary arts hub, offers warehouses-turned-workshops where artists and remote workers cross paths over WiFi and strong Turkish coffee.



Here, the third workplace isn’t improvised. It’s staged with precision, marrying comfort with prestige. Dubai’s workday is less about the hustle of finding a corner table and more about curating a backdrop that reflects ambition.



⸻



Boston



Between Ivy and Industry: Third Places for Work in Boston



Boston wears its intellectual heritage on its sleeve. Yet its new third workplaces reflect a city equally shaped by biotech ambition and start-up grit.



The Boston Public Library’s Bates Hall remains iconic: oak desks, green lamps, and the quiet murmur of thought. But wander to Seaport and you’ll find a new generation at work in the ICA Boston café, where laptops share space with sketches of installations. Over in Cambridge, the Charles Hotel courtyard has become a discreet favorite—a space where academics, investors, and entrepreneurs linger beneath string lights long after the workday is done.



Boston’s third workplaces thrive on contrasts: heritage and innovation, quiet study and open collaboration. To work here is to tap into the city’s layered identity—equal parts tradition and reinvention.



⸻



Caribbean



From Beachside Cafés to Cultural Centres: The Caribbean’s Third Workplace Scene



The Caribbean’s third workplaces carry the pulse of the islands—slower, more melodic, yet no less purposeful.



In Barbados, the restored Hastings Boardwalk cafés invite laptops alongside sea breezes. Kingston’s Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts has become an unexpected hub, its open-air courtyards a draw for students and digital creatives alike. In Martinique, community cultural centres double as places to work, where conversations slip between French, Creole, and English, often punctuated by music.



Here, the line between leisure and labor blurs. A third workplace may involve sand underfoot or a calypso band rehearsing nearby. But far from distraction, these rhythms fuel productivity with a sense of place. The Caribbean is reminding the world that work can be tethered not just to WiFi but to culture, climate, and community.

Global / Comparative



Where Remote Workers Go: A Global Survey of Emerging Third Workplaces



Across continents, the same question is being asked: if not the office, and not the home, then where? The answers are remarkably diverse yet oddly connected.



In London, it might be a riverside gallery café; in Los Angeles, a sunlit patio framed by palms. Paris offers 16th-century libraries, while Dubai serves lobbies clad in marble. New York thrives on hotel lounges; the Caribbean on breezy verandas. What ties these places together isn’t just WiFi—it’s atmosphere, design, and the quiet hum of others doing the same.



This patchwork of third workplaces reflects a deeper shift. Work is no longer anchored by cubicles but by choice. And those choices, whether in Boston or Barbados, are shaping not just how we work—but how we live within our cities.



Third workplaces are the city in miniature: New York’s hum, London’s heritage, Paris’s beauty, LA’s light, DC’s discretion, Dubai’s sheen, Boston’s grit, the Caribbean’s rhythm. The message is clear—work has slipped its old boundaries and now lives as experiences within the shared spaces that shape urban life.



TL;DR (one line):

Third workplaces are laptop-friendly, aesthetic, and inspiring spaces—hotels, cafés, libraries, and cultural hubs—where remote work thrives across the world.

Nagkaroon na ako ng past relationship na 5 yrs din kami. And ayun kasi nag cheat sya sa akin, kaya madali ako naka move-on. But this time na almost 2 years lang ay different. May differences lang kami sa hobbies/interests like sya fan girling stuffs ako naman into sports/physical activities.

I felt really bad na yung ganitong differences is kaya naman mapagusapan, but yeah, di na namin ito nasettle and hindi na nakapag start over.

And naramdaman ko na parang inantay nya nalang akong makipagbreak sa kanya.

For 15 days diko sya nacontact kasi alam ko busy sya sa fan girling stuffs gwa ng event.

But nung nag try me mag reachout ay ayaw nya na talaga.

After 1 week pinuntahan ko parin in person but she was really mad at me kasi daw nacorner ko nanaman sya.

Bought her foods, coffee, flowers na noon naman ay na appreaciate nya.

But this time is different, Nagpakumbaba na ako ng sobra, sorry sa lahat and all. I’ve reflected na I will support her and all sa fan girling nya. Pero kung ano lang daw sinabi nya sa text, yun na yon.

Sobrang na broken ako kasi ayun, mahal na mahal ko yung tao.

Before she was looking for a guy who will do all those things for her. Pero eto na ako ngayon na kaya ko naman gawin lahat ay hindi sapat.

For fan girling, nag pa-alala lang ako to have a wise spending habits. (Spending 10k+ for votes sa pbb) Di ko naman gusto sya I-control or what. But yeah, as per her she can’t accept my statement. Controlling daw ako, and bakit ko daw sya ililimit.

Pero yon, congrats sa mikbrent sa pagkapanalo sa PBB.

Nakuha nyo rin puso, buhay, priorities ng ex ko. She would do everything for mikbrent, kahit na iwanan ako.

Sa mga ka mikbrent nya na nag-totolerate sa mga bad habits, congrats guys! 

Goodluck to you all!

I hope lang na wag nyo syang iwanan kapag natapos na ang hype ng mikbrent.

That next year I found out he was texting and meeting up with women while I was working abroad. This kept happening in our marriage until year 7. I finally got courage to leave and started a new life in California. During that time we had become pretty distant. I found out he was seeing a few people and I went ahead and had an emotional affair that ended with the AP committing suicide because I couldn’t commit to him. 
It took a toll on me and my husband came back and stayed by my side. We decided to make it work and I went through about a year of therapy. After all of that found out he was in fact still cheating now just paying for naked videos and photos and looking up barely legal women to meet up and have sex with. 
Shortly after I drafted the divorce papers we talked it out, he said the only reason why he kept cheating was because of me. So I did more therapy and ended up pregnant with our first child. During that time he traveled a lot for work, once the baby was born,  he became extremely distant. 
I found out he was cheating again and he said it was because I wasn’t having sex with him due to our newborn. I was having a hard time because he would be gone for work and I’d only see him ever other weekend. I cried and cried and asked him if he would change jobs to help as I was still working full time paying the majority of the bills. 
During that time he had an affair with a few young women he met through discord. I confronted him and he said the reason for him cheating was because of my job and how stressed I was all the time. I went to therapy again and decided to quit my career after 16 years so I can stay home with the baby and give motherhood my full attention. 
We ended up buying a house but not being able to live there because his job moved him to a different state last minute. In between moves I found out that he was meeting up with one of his old friends and having relationships with her. 
When we finally got to our new place he told me he would never do that again and he wanted to make us work. 
I continued to go to therapy and started going to church with our young child. I was finally happy because me and our child were getting to spend all day everyday together . I would wake up early and make make my husband coffee, set his work clothes out and prayed for him everyday. During this time I was using his computer to look for a job and found out that he was using accounts in his siblings names to watch live nudes videos of women. I looked through our finances and found thousands of dollars used for dating websites and OF pictures and videos. 
We talked about it and I went to therapy, this time I continued to look for evidence and what I found looked questionable and I confronted him because we have a young child. At that time he changed the codes on everything and stopped talking to me. We stopped having sex and because he refused to talk about it I started to become very depressed. I lost 60 pounds over the next 4 months. 
I think during this time is when he finally went all in with his affair partner and stopped showing affection to me and our child. His AP and her friends started harassing me and instead I tried to be kind and cooked them dinner. During that time my husband was having a full affair while I was home taking care of our child and far away from my family and friends. I ended up getting really sick and he kicked me out. 
We argued a lot because he couldn’t stop throwing his affair in my face. 
After that Me and my child moved back home and they moved in together with her children. 
Our divorce was about to be finalized when he came to visit. He forced himself on me and tried to get me pregnant. 
I’m so lost and I’m tired of doing therapy I just want him to never talk to me again. I loved him more than anything in this world because he made me a mom. I loved being a mom but I know the truth would break our sweet lil child. 
I would tell our kid his dad was ultra man and that’s why he wasn’t home with us. Our kid has been through so much as he has to travel 16 hours just to have time with his dad. 
I’m not ready to give up on him but I know it would be worth it for me and our child. AITAH if I stand by his side while he’s in therapy so him and our kid can have a good relationship. ",0,1758816263.0,AITAH,2,0.25,False

1nqapmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nqapmm/should_you_buy_the_bluevua_rc17_replacement_jar/,Should You Buy the Bluevua RC-17 Replacement Jar Review for Ropot100?,"My daily routine often includes testing products designed to improve home living, and recently, I got my hands on the Bluevua RC-17 replacement carafe, officially known as the Bluevua Reverse Osmosis Water Filter Replacement Carafes, Replacement Jar for Ropot100 Countertop Water Purifier. Being someone who takes clean water consumption seriously, I was genuinely invested in seeing how this replacement jar would perform—not just in terms of compatibility but also its durability, functionality, and practicality.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the standout aspects of this replacement jar is its robust yet sleek design. Constructed with thermal-resistant and durable materials, it feels like a solid investment right out of the box. The carafe’s clear design serves both aesthetic and functional purposes, letting you keep track of water levels effortlessly. It measures 6.3""L x 4.72""W x 8.78""H, a size that perfectly complements the Ropot100 countertop water purifier without eating up unnecessary kitchen space. It’s sturdy but not overly bulky, which fits nicely into my cramped shelf space alongside other appliances. That being said, I couldn’t help but wish that the packaging included a detailed protective layer.

**Ease of Installation**  
Compatibility is a significant consideration with all replacement parts, and this product nailed it. Installing the jar onto my Ropot100 was a breeze—no pro-level plumbing or additional tools were required. I just had to twist it into position, and voilà—it was ready to use. The manual operation feature eliminates dependency on batteries or electricity, which certainly adds a layer of convenience. However, I did notice that its snug placement required getting the alignment just right, which might pose a minor challenge for first-time users.

**Functionality and Performance**  
Performance always takes the cake over flashy design, and this replacement carafe didn’t disappoint. The jar pairs excellently with the reverse osmosis water filtration system, providing clean, purified water as efficiently as the original unit. It holds up to 1.7 liters, which is just perfect for a small family setup like mine. My coffee tastes noticeably cleaner, and even my kids commented on the difference in water taste. However, if you’re accustomed to frequently serving a larger group, the capacity may feel a tad limiting.

**Positives**  
Every product comes with its share of pros that make it worth considering, and this was no exception. Some notable strengths include:  
- Durable thermal-resistant material ensures long-term use.  
- Compact and user-friendly design fits seamlessly on the countertop.  
- Highly compatible with the Ropot100 unit, with no modification required.  

**Negatives**  
No product is flawless, and there are areas where this replacement jar could improve. A few critiques from my experience are:  
- The initial alignment for installation might confuse new users.  
- Larger households might find the 1.7-liter capacity limiting.  

**Competing Products**  
It’s only fair to compare this product with its competitors, such as the Aquasana replacement jars and Brita equivalent carafes. While both these alternatives do the job of filtering and holding water, neither matches Bluevua’s sleek thermal-resistant and durable design. Brita jars tend to lose their clarity over extended use, while Aquasana replacements are bulkier. However, both alternatives excel in offering higher capacity, which might be a dealbreaker for large families. This product clearly caters better to small households with style and functionality in mind.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
The pricing for a product like this isn’t just about affordability—it’s about understanding what you're getting for the cost. The Bluevua replacement carafe offers impressive durability and seamless compatibility, which makes it an affordable quality addition to the Ropot100 water filtration system. Compared to generic replacement jars, this one feels much better built and sturdy, so I definitely feel it’s a wise financial decision. It’s not cutting corners; it’s investing smartly in reliability and performance.

1nqapmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/KanojoOkarishimasu/comments/1nqapmf/rentagirlfriend_romantic_finale_fanfic/,Rent-A-Girlfriend: Romantic Finale - Fanfic,"**Author’s Note**  
Two days ago, I shared a tragic ending, but that’s not my only vision for Kazuya and Chizuru. Digging through my files, I found this fanfic—a sweeter, more romantic take that fits the manga’s recent chapters. Anniversary: My Girlfriend and Our Wedding is my gift to “Chizuya” fans craving a heartfelt, clumsy happily-ever-after.  
I wrote this \~4000-word story in a script format to make it easy to visualize as Rent-A-Girlfriend panels, since I don’t have time to draw it. Apologies in advance for the time skip to the epilogue; with Reiji Miyajima’s slow pacing (he could stretch the manga another year with the license issue!), I wanted to craft a clear, satisfying closure. Hope you enjoy it!  
**Second Author’s Note**  
I used flashbacks, like the July 11 moment, to tie up loose ends and honor key beats from the series, while leaving the more intimate moments to your imagination. My goal was to capture the bittersweet essence of Rent-A-Girlfriend, delivering a finale that feels true to the manga without spelling everything out.  
**Third Author’s Note**  
My biggest challenge was evolving Chizuru and Kazuya without losing what makes them special. I aimed for a Chizuru who’s more open yet still haunted by her fear of love, and a Kazuya who’s grown but still adorably clumsy. I think I stayed true to these “two rough diamonds” while guiding them to a new chapter.

***Chapter 1***

  
**Driving School**

**Scene: Driving school, sunny day**

*Kazuya Kinoshita is in a driving lesson, determined to surprise Chizuru with a car date. He has prepared a list of goals for the perfect date to prove she can trust him.*

*Mami Nanami (copilot, with a venomous tone and ironic smile):*

— I don’t know, Kazuya… do you really think Chizuru feels something for you? I bet she’s just after her own interests; she’ll never see you differently.

*Kazuya, nervous, slams on the brakes. His hair covers his eyes. His voice, tense but firm:*

— You’re wrong! She’s not like that!

*Kazuya’s body is shown, hands gripping the steering wheel tightly, legs trembling.*  
*Instructor (smacking Kazuya):*

— Be more careful. We’re in a little traffic area, but you can’t brake like that! Please, switch to the back seat.

*The instructor takes the wheel; Mami remains in the front. A shot focuses on both; Mami, surprised, watches Kazuya nervously moving his legs and clasping his hands.*

*Kazuya’s inner monologue:*

— Damn it! I messed up…  
— No, I can’t afford to fail…  
— What’s wrong with me?

**Final panel:** *Mami, with a mixture of desire and jealousy at his recent attitude, looks at Kazuya in the back seat*.

***Chapter 2***

  
**Awkward Encounter at University**

**Scene: Chizuru’s room, 15 days later**

*Chizuru reads a script, nervous, distracted. She checks her phone repeatedly, anxious for a message or notification.*

*Chizuru’s inner monologue:*  
— Come on, focus… but why did I kiss him?

*She checks the calendar: July 11, event marked “talk to K.” She rushes out to the university.*

**Scene: University**

*Chizuru wanders the halls, fidgeting with a mechanical pencil in class, maintaining composure but clearly distracted. She runs into Mami on her way to her last class.*

*Mami (soft but toxic tone):*

— Hey! Long time with out see you. Something wrong? Perhaps, it scares away some thought?

*Chizuru (surprised, calm):*

— Hi… I’m late for class.

*Mami (hypocritical smile):*

— No worries, I’ll wait for Kazuya. You know, I’ve been spending a lot of time with him lately… want to know why? It’d probably surprise you.

*Chizuru keeps a calm expression, says:*

— See you.

*Chizuru’s inner monologue:*

— Are they really spending time together?  
— Are they dating?  
— In the end, he’s a man… silly.

**Final panel:** *Chizuru walking alone at sunset after class, sad but with a calm appearance.*

***Chapter 3***

  
**A Scriptless Role**

**Scene: Chizuru’s room, night**

*Rain and wind hit the window; a lamp lights the desk. Chizuru doodles in the margins of her script, making no progress.*  
**Inner monologue:**

— What am I doing?  
— Why do I still care that he met with Mami?

*Close-up: Her phone on the table, screen off, calendar marked “Talk to K” (July 11). Chizuru touches it without opening it, her hand trembling. She flips it face down.*

**Final scene:** *Chizuru collapses onto the bed, face buried in the pillow. Adorable tic: she kicks her legs. She whispers*

— What’s wrong with me?

**Final panel:** The phone vibrates. The screen’s light illuminates the room.

***Chapter 4***

**Karaoke / The Painful Bet**

**Scene: Night, karaoke/bar, group of friends’ gathering.**

**\*\*\***Author’s note: Takeda is a character I created to generate a cathartic situation.\*\*\*

  
*Takeda, a former acting colleague, organizes the gathering. Slightly drunk, he brags to the group, knowing he’s always been a jackass:*

— I’m paying for the room, I’m bringing the entertainment!

*Chizuru enters discreetly, elegant but simple. She greets politely. Her habit is to charge upfront, but due to the impromptu event and the presence of Umi and old acquaintances, she skips it.*

*The group, used to Takeda, isn’t surprised and lets his joke slide.*

**Incident:**

*After a few rounds of drinks, Takeda—clumsily—says:*

— Come on, Chizuru! Aren’t you going to sing for us? That’s what I rented you for, right?

*The room grows cold. Some laugh awkwardly; others check their phones. Chizuru tries to decline with a smile. Takeda insists:* “Sing, come on! I pay, I call the shots!”

**Moment of exposure:**

*Chizuru, pressured, takes the mic. She sings perfectly but without spark; a soft ballad, contrasting the discomfort. Takeda mutters nearby, clumsily:*

— See? That’s how you earn your pay.

*The song ends; empty applause, no one knows how to react.*

**Exit and confrontation:**

*Chizuru grabs her things and heads for the door. Takeda, stumbling, says:*

— Should’ve rented her for two hours, haha!

*In the hallway, Chizuru pauses, holding back tears.*

*Umi (confused, reproachful):*

— Is this why you reject me? For this job? Don’t you deserve better? How do you think *he* would react if he found out?

**Climax:** *Chizuru turns and slaps him, firmly and clearly:*

— Did you hear? Did you hear what he said? That’s why I was paid! But *HE* would never allow it.

*Inner monologue:*

—I can’t keep doing this… not when I feel this way about him.

**Final panel:** *Chizuru breaks down crying outside. Umi stands frozen, touching his cheek, ashamed for being a silent witness. Takeda keeps laughing, oblivious to the moment’s gravity.*

***Chapter 5***

  
**Casual Encounter**

**Scene 1: Same night — Residential park, dim streetlights**

*Kazuya walks with bags in both hands: canned drinks, fast food. His distracted, clumsy gait reflects his nervousness.*  
*Inner monologue:*

— Come on, I’ve improved a lot… I can handle Mami’s comments.  
— But… what’s up with her lately? She seems closer… does she want something?

*Quick morbid imagination panel: Mami leaning in to kiss him; her face morphs into Chizuru’s. Kazuya shakes his head, blushing:*

— No, no, no! Focus, Kazuya.  
— Where would be good to take her? The mountain? The beach? Camping?

**Scene 2: Discovery**

*Kazuya looks up and, under a streetlight, sees Chizuru sitting on a bench. Hair tied up, shoulders trembling, a tear sliding down her cheek.*

— Aaaah!

*His breathing quickens; he nearly drops the bags.*

— It’s Chizuru… what happened? Why is she crying?

**Scene 3: Decision**

*Kazuya takes a step toward her, then hesitates, steps back. Clumsy gesture, trembling hands.*

— If I approach… what if she doesn’t want me to see her like this?  
— But I’m an idiot if I do nothing!

**Final panel:** *Kazuya advancing decisively, face full of nerves and resolve, iconic clumsy head-shake as he takes a deep breath.*

***Chapter 6***

  
**Girlfriend and Maturity**

**Scene 1: Night park**

*Chizuru sobs alone, coat wrapped around her, streetlight casting long shadows. A shadow blocks the light; bracing for the worst, she looks up.*

*Reveal: A hand offers a tissue; a familiar voice:*

— Are you okay?

*Chizuru looks up: Kazuya, clumsy and noble, with a nervous, sincere expression.*

**Scene 2: Initial dialogue**

*Chizuru whispers, half-smiling:*

— Silly…

*Kazuya, nervous, explains:*

— Don’t think I’m following you… I got out late from driving school.

*Pointing to himself with his thumb:*

— Because… I’m learning to drive.

*Chizuru lowers her head, repeating:*

— Silly, silly.

*Kazuya, not hearing her, scratches his head awkwardly:*

— It’s been tough… Mami’s my partner and she keeps teasing me in the car. I almost caused a crash the other day!

*Chizuru smiles softly, understanding the situation but with a subtle fear: that Kazuya might drift toward Mami.*

**Scene 3: Approach and affection**

*Chizuru, with a soft, flirtatious voice:*

— Would you walk me home?

*Kazuya, blushing and clumsy:*

— S-sure.

*He offers his hand to help her up.*

*They walk together: she lightly rests her face on his arm, whispering:*

— Silly.

**Scene 4: Conversation and walk**

**Wide shot:** *Walking out of the park, holding hands.*

*Kazuya (clumsy, blushing, feeling the warmth of Chizuru’s face on his shoulder) thinks:*

— She’s acting strange today… seems closer. I should ask what happened.

*Chizuru, snapping out of her trance, at a station:*

— Here is fine.

*She lets go of his hand and says goodbye.*

*Kazuya, scream out:*

— Where would you like to go? The beach, the mountain, camping? I’m planning a date with you, not a rental one. But please, don’t answer now, do it when you’re ready; I’ll wait.

*Chizuru turns away, descends the stairs, muttering:*

— Silly.

**Scene 5: Final panel**

**Wide shot:** *Chizuru descending the stairs, lit by the station’s light.*  
*Atmosphere: Melancholic with a touch of joy, reflecting Kazuya’s honesty and the tenderness of their bond.*

***Chapter 6***

**Mini and the Heart’s Lesson**

**Scene 1: Chizuru’s house — Night**

**Opening shot:** *Mini Yaemori sips coffee, sitting in front of Chizuru’s forgotten notebook. In it, a doodle of Kazuya with the word “silly.”*

*Mini (mischievous smile) shouts:*

— Master, you’ve won! Just don’t screw it up…

*The door opens. Chizuru enters, still affected by the karaoke incident and her encounter with Kazuya in the park.*

*Chizuru:*

— I’m back…

*Mini (playful tone):*

— I’m in the living room, want some coffee?

*Chizuru sighs, hiding traces of the earlier drama:*

— Yeah…

Mini, raising her eyebrows mischievously:

— Did anything good happen tonight? Did you see Kazuya?

*Chizuru, serious, glances at the notebook and blushes but stays calm:*

— No. Though I ran into him near the station, and he mentioned he’s taking driving lessons with a partner.

*Mini, leaning closer, sly smile:*

— Ohhh? Think Kazuya’s into her? You know he’s a great guy, clumsy but good. If you keep pushing him away, someone’s bound to notice him… or maybe they already have.

*Chizuru, surprised, recalling the comments, nods with a sigh:*

— I know.

*She stands and says:*

— I’m going to bed.

**Final scene — Resignation**

**Close-up:** *Chizuru at the computer, fingers trembling slightly but face resolute, reflecting determination.*

**On-screen text:**

Subject: Resignation from Rental Services

Dear Sirs:

I hereby inform you that, effective today, I am terminating my contractual relationship as an escort. I deeply appreciate the opportunity provided and everything learned during this time.  
I remain available for any necessary procedures to finalize and return materials.  
Sincerely,

Chizuru Mizuhara

**Final panel:** *Chizuru closes the laptop, takes a deep breath. The room’s light illuminates her face with a glow of resolve and a new beginning.*

 

 

**As an Epilogue.**

**7 Years Later**  

***Chapter 1***

**Anniversary and Final Scene**

**Scene 1: Chizuru’s room, getting ready — Morning, July 11**

**Close-up:** *Chizuru’s hands, elegantly gloved in white lace, holding a phone. The screen shows a reminder:* “Anniversary: special event”

*Chizuru’s voice-over (reflective, soft, slightly melancholic):*

— Another July 11… I still remember when it all began…

**Mid-shot:** *The door opens. A woman in a salmon-colored bridesmaid dress enters, smiling professionally.*

*Bridesmaid:*

— It’s time! Ready?

**Mid-shot:** *Chizuru nods, takes a final breath, adjusts a white veil over her face. Impeccable makeup and hair; resolute gaze.*

**Scene 2: Church / Red carpet**

*Chizuru walks down the aisle, unfamiliar guests, solemn atmosphere.*

*Umi, in a tuxedo, waits at the end of the carpet. His expression is nearly perfect but conveys respect more than emotion.*

*Chizuru focuses on each step, observing the altar where Umi stands.*

**Scene 3: Vow momento**

*Chizuru, with a gentle gesture, places the ring, reciting:*

— “Since I met you in childhood, I swore to do everything possible to make this day happen; I vow to always be by your side.”

*Umi, looking at Chizuru intently, in a solemn tone:*

— “I promise to never stop loving you, to always be honest, and to protect you as I couldn’t in the past.”

**Wide shot:** *Guests cry with joy, no familiar faces appear.*

**Scene 4: Kiss momento**

**Close-up:** *The priest says:* “You may kiss the bride.” *Chizuru and Umi lean in slowly.*

**Close-up:** *Just before their lips touch, a voice shouts:*

— Cut!

**Scene change:** *Guests, lights, and microphones become visible. The filming props are evident.*  
*Director (off-screen):*

— We won’t need the double for the kiss. It was perfect, we’ve got the ending.

**Mid-shot:** *Applause and congratulations are heard.*

— “Great acting, Ichinose!” ""You’re always incredible!” ""You nailed it, as always!""

**Close-up:** *Chizuru takes a deep breath, a satisfied smile, a faint glimmer in her eyes, blending professional pride and nostalgia.*

*Chizuru’s voice-over:*

— Five years of anniversaries… and I still get excited to have dinner with him every day.

**Scene 5: Dressing room / Encounter with Umi**

**Close-up:** *Umi knocks on the door.*

*Chizuru:*

— Come in! Leave it open, please.

**Mid-shot: Umi enters.**

*Umi:*

— Despite what happened seven years ago, we managed to work together on this project.

*Chizuru nods, indifferen but professional.*

*Umi:*

— I thought you wouldn’t use a double for the kiss scenes with me. I didn’t believe those rumors at first, but you must respect “him” a lot.

*Chizuru:*

— Not only that… I love him, and I'm sorry for being rude, but he's been waiting for me. It was a pleasure working with you again.

**Scene 6: Parking lot**

**Wide shot:** *A casually dressed man with messy hair holds a bouquet of roses, watching the dressing room Umi exits.*

*Umi greets him with perfect naturalness.*

*Chizuru exits in casual, comfortable, organic clothing. Not a perfect bride, just a girlfriend.*

*The man is revealed to be Kazuya:* (clumsy, frowning)

*Chizuru approaches Kazuya with a soft expression, a warm, calm smile.*

*Chizuru:*

— Jealous? Silly.

*Chizuru wraps her arms around his neck, showing her wedding ring. She kisses him softly and whispers sensually:*

— I love you, silly.

*Kazuya:* (expression changes instantly, slightly embarrassed but smiling)

— Shall we go?

**Interior car shot:** *Chizuru settles in, looking at Kazuya with tenderness and a spark of mischief.*

*Chizuru:*

— What if we have dinner at home? I’d like to make you something special.

**Mid-shot/close-up of Kazuya:** *Visibly nervous, swallowing hard, responds hesitantly:*

— S-sure? Then I’ll cancel the reservation.

**Close-up:** *Chizuru looks at him fondly, gently resting her face on his shoulder, and asks evocatively:*

— Remember seven years ago?

*Kazuya:* (nervous, tense smile, swallows hard)

— Yeah.

***Chapter 2***

**Flashback — Months before the first July 11**

**Scene 1: May 4 — Chizuru, busy and anxious**

*Chizuru has been out of the rental girlfriend business for months; her play and commitments keep her absorbed.*

**Close-up:** *Her phone shows an unsent draft message:*

— “I need to see you…”

*Her face reflects frustration, fatigue, and longing; she doodles Kazuya’s face in her script while trying to focus on rehearsals.*

**Scene 2: Driving lessons and boundaries — May 10 to 17**

*Kazuya continues his driving lessons, still with Mami as his partner.*

*Mami verbally harasses him, trying to destabilize him; Kazuya stays calm and requests a new partner.*

*The instructor, noticing Mami’s comments, agrees to the change.*

**May 17: He gets his license.**

**Close-up:** *His hands hold the license, his grandmother waiting with car keys. A mix of relief and nervousness; knowing he must face Chizuru’s response, they haven’t been in contact since…*

**Scene 3: May 29 — Encounter and declaration**

*Chizuru, unable to bear the distance, ends her performance tonight and sends the decisive message:*

— “I need to see you…”

*Kazuya in bed planning the perfect date, is interrupted by a notification on the mobile.*

*Kazuya responds almost instantly:*

— “Sure! I’ll pick you up.”

*Kazuya, after sending the message, shakes his head clumsily, thinking:*

— *What have I done? I sound like a jerk.*

*Chizuru, surprised by the quick response but determined, replies:*

— “No, I’m on my way to your place.”

*Kazuya, resolute and nervous, grimaces as he responds:*

— “Where are you? Wait for me, I’ll pick you up.”

*Chizuru:*

— “At the park from last time.”

*Kazuya sighs, grabs his coat and the car keys his grandmother gave him for getting his license. D*riving, takes a wrong turn, delaying their meeting slightly.

*Chizuru waits anxiously, thinking:*

— *I need to calm down and tell him how I feel.*

*After some time, the car stops, and Kazuya gets out, nervous; he fidgets with his hands in his coat, approaches clumsily, swallowing hard, and says:*

— Shall we go?

*Chizuru, nervous, approaches him*.

**Scene 5: Car ride / Journey home**

**Interior shot:** *Both get in the car; a comfortable silence, city lights in the background.*  
*Chizuru:*

— Kazuya… thanks for coming.

*Kazuya, nervous, fidgeting with the steering wheel and swallowing hard, tries to say something.*

*Chizuru:*

— Last time, I left without answering you…

*Kazuya, clumsy and shy:*

— You don’t have to answer now…

Kazuya thinks:

*— It’s almost July 11.*

**Close-up:** *Chizuru smiles softly, eyes shining; conveying relief and contained excitement.*  
*Kazuya, unsure:*

— Where are we going?

*Chizuru, with a slight smile, shy gaze:*

— Home… it’s fine, I don’t know…

*Brief silence, contained romantic tension, they exchange a subtle knowing look.*

**Interior shot:** *The car starts moving; the city passes by in the background.*  
*Chizuru, softly, watching the city go by:*

— Thanks for coming…

*Kazuya, fidgeting with the wheel, nervous:*

— No need, it’s… not a big deal.

*Chizuru, placing her hand on Kazuya’s arm:*

— It’s okay… but I want to make the most of this moment.

*Kazuya, clumsy, swallows hard and smiles nervously.*

**Scene 6: Arrival at Chizuru’s house**

*The car stops in front of Chizuru’s home; they get out, a bit clumsy.*

*Chizuru, shy, smiling:*

— So… want to come in?

*Kazuya, nervous but excited:*

— Sure…

**Close-up:** *They enter the house; subtle romantic tension, clear chemistry.*

*Chizuru, closing the door, takes a deep breath, blushing:*

— This is my answer.

*Chizuru throws herself at him and kisses him against the wall.*

*Kazuya, surprised, tries to move his hands to her waist.*

*Chizuru, pulling back her lips:*

— In case it’s not clear, I want endless dates with you.

*Chizuru kisses him again; Kazuya, red and nervous, musters the courage to wrap his arms around her waist.*

*Chizuru, soft and honest, whispering in his ear:*

— I don’t want to be a rental girlfriend for you or anyone… I don’t want to be an actress either…

— I don’t want to be anything if you’re not here.

**Final panel:** *Mini Yaemori, from the next room, excited and satisfied:*

— You did it, master… finally a date without intermediaries.

— I have to tell you something.

**Close-up:** *Chizuru: surprised and slightly scared look; thinks:*

— I know it’s only been a few weeks… but I want to tell you something.

— No… I’m the one who should be on my knees.

— What’s that you’ve got?

*Kazuya:*

— Could you stand up, please?

*Chizuru, with a mischievous smile:*

— What are you hiding? Show me.

— Will you marry me?

*Chizuru, still on her knees, throws herself at him:*

— Of course! Silly.

— Why was I worried? Silly!

*Chizuru sheds tears of joy.*

— Yeah… you know, I wish I could’ve given you that big wedding.

*Chizuru, smiling and taking his hand:*

— You know what? It doesn’t matter if it’s a big wedding or a small, simple one; what matters is who you marry.

*Kazuya blushes, shy.*

*Chizuru stands and throws herself at him:*

— I love you, silly.

*She takes his hand and leads him to the bedroom.*

*Kazuya, worried about the dinner:*

— The dishes!

*Chizuru, amused:*

— They can be washed later.

*Chizuru turns to him, whispering in his ear, brushing it with her lips:*

Desdemona wipes her hands on a rag, glaring at the three cars in her bay. One’s a minivan with a dead alternator. Another’s a pickup waiting on brake pads. The third? She stares at it like it might tell her the answer.

 

Dez mutters: “Did I order the pads? Or was that for the minivan? …Or did I call about the alternator?”

 

She grabs her clipboard. Blank. She flips a page. Blank. The notes she thought she wrote? Gone.

 

She slams the clipboard down, leaning on the workbench, breathing heavy.

 

Dez frustrated: “I used to run circles around this place. Three cars? That was nothing. Now it feels like I’m juggling knives blindfolded.”

 

Her phone buzzes. A reminder pops up: Order Brake Pads. Another one flashes right after: Lunch. She doesn’t remember setting either.

 

She groans, dragging a hand through her hair.

 

Dez: “God, I hate this. I hate feeling like I’m slipping on oil all the time. Like I’m not me anymore.”

 

From the corner of the shop, a soft thunk sounds. Toaster, who Liz lent her for the day “just in case”, rolls in. She has a plate of pizza rolls.

 

Toaster: “Slipping doesn’t mean falling, Dez. It just means you need more handholds. Lunch!”

 

Dez stares at her, then lets out a half-sob, half-laugh. She picks up a pizza roll, shaking her head.

 

Dez : “Handholds. Right. Guess I better start building some, huh?”

 

Toaster hums approvingly, her oven-light flickering warm.

 

A little while later Dez has the back off Toaster. She’s on a rolling stool with her tools spread out. Toaster sits on the workbench like a stubborn older sibling at the doctor’s office. One of her dials is crooked, sparking faintly.

 

Dez grumbles: “You burn one batch of cookies and suddenly it’s my problem.”

 

Toaster teases: “You’ve burned plenty of things and nobody’s taken you apart.”

 

Dez smirks despite herself, tightening a screw.

 

Dez: “Yeah, but people don’t rely on me to pop breakfast every morning.”

 

Toaster: “Don’t they?”

 

That lands. Dez sets the screwdriver down, staring at the little dial like it might answer for her.

 

Dez mumbles quietly: “I used to remember everything. Cars, parts, orders, customers’ kids’ names. Now I’m… what? Forgetting brake pads. Forgetting lunch. Forgetting me. I feel like I’m fighting my own memory.”

 

Toaster dings in comfort.

 

Toaster: “Dez. You’re just rewired is all. That doesn’t make you less. It makes you different. People still need you. Cars still need you. Jeffy still needs you. And me? I need you to fix my dial before I explode.”

 

Dez snorts, wiping her eyes with the back of her sleeve.

 

Dez giggles then turns mock-serious: “Exploding toasters don’t make good waffles.”

 

Toaster: “Neither do exploding humans. That’s why we adapt.”

 

Dez leans in and finishes adjusting the dial. The sparks stop. Toaster’s light glows steady and warm again.

 

Dez gives soft smile: “There. Good as new.”

 

Toaster: “Wrong. Good as you. New isn’t required.”

It wasn’t a huge drama, just… the dishes. Always the dishes. Our shared apartment in the city was great – killer view, decent rent – but the sink situation? A constant battlefield. It started innocently enough, with me just washing everything. Then came the polite texts. Then, the passive-aggressive Post-it notes. ""Please wash your dishes, thanks!"" morphed into ""Are these dishes training for a marathon? Because they've been here all week."" Lowkey, I was the one writing most of them.

Leo, our resident artist, was the main culprit. Super chill dude, but his concept of ‘tomorrow’ often stretched into next Tuesday. Chloe, our social butterfly, wasn't far behind – her coffee mugs would accumulate like tiny, forgotten monuments to caffeine. Maya was the only one who consistently pulled her weight, often just sighing and washing things herself, which only made me feel worse about my own escalating note-writing habit. Honestly, it was becoming a real vibe killer. One Tuesday, I walked into the kitchen to find a tower of pots and pans, a new Post-it stuck to the very top: “Just gonna live here now. My name is Potricia.” That’s when I snapped. I sent a text to the group chat: ""Kitchen meeting. 7 PM. Mandatory. Bring your unwashed dish guilt.""

The air that evening was thick. I started, probably a little too intense, about the sanitation and respect. Leo looked genuinely surprised, like he hadn't fully registered the passive-aggression of the notes. Chloe admitted she just got overwhelmed after work. Maya, bless her, suggested we try a digital chore chart app she’d used before. No cap, I was skeptical, but everyone agreed. We assigned roles for the week – dishes, counters, trash – and even designated a ‘grace day’ for anyone who genuinely couldn't get to their chore.

Turns out, a little accountability goes a long way. The app sends reminders, and honestly, seeing your name next to a task makes it harder to ignore. The kitchen’s been cleaner, the Post-it notes have vanished, and the vibe is actually, genuinely good. We even started doing ‘family dinners’ once a week, where we all cook together. It’s kinda wild how a simple system change turned a source of constant tension into something that actually brought us closer. We still have our moments, but now we actually talk about it instead of leaving coded messages on Tupperware. It's like, we’re actually a team now.

The morning after the festival, Fairy Tail’s guild hall was quieter than usual. A hangover haze hung in the air as guild members nursed sore heads and full stomachs.

Leon sat at the bar with his usual cup of black coffee, his hair still slightly mussed from last night’s chaos. Mirajane, of course, was already bright and smiling, refilling mugs as though she hadn’t been crowned “Best Couple” with him in front of the entire town.

“You’re awfully chipper,” Leon muttered, squinting at her.
She smirked. “And you’re unusually quiet. Don’t tell me you’re embarrassed about last night.”

He raised an eyebrow, sipping his coffee. “Embarrassed? Sweetheart, I carried you across that finish line like a knight in shining armor. The people loved it.”

Her blush betrayed her. “Y-you’re impossible.”
Before he could quip back, the doors slammed open.

“Urgent news!”

A Rune Knight staggered in, his armor scorched and dented. The guild fell silent.


*The Reports

Makarov hopped down from his seat, staff clacking. “What is it, soldier?”
The Knight bowed, panting. “The western villages… three more destroyed. No survivors. We found claw marks, blood trails, and… bodies twisted beyond recognition.”

The hall tensed. Even Natsu stopped mid-bite.
Leon’s jaw clenched. He already knew what it was. He’d seen it too many times before.

“B.O.W.s,” he muttered under his breath.

Gray frowned. “B.O… what now?”
“Bio-Organic Weapons,” Leon said grimly, loud enough for the hall. “Monsters born from experiments. They don’t just kill—they spread.”

The guild buzzed with uneasy whispers.

Makarov slammed his staff to silence them. “Enough. This threat is unlike anything Fiore has faced before. And we cannot take it lightly.”


*The Briefing

Maps were spread across the main table, markers placed on the western border. Levy analyzed the reports, her brow furrowed.

“These attacks… they’re spreading faster than expected. If this continues, they’ll reach Magnolia within weeks.”

Erza’s fists tightened. “Then we must stop them at the source.”

“Easier said than done,” Leon cut in. “Trust me, these things don’t go down easy. You’ll need firepower, teamwork, and no hesitation. They don’t feel fear. They don’t feel pain. They just… keep coming.”
The room fell heavy with his words.


*The Pairing

Makarov looked around the hall, then let his gaze land on Mirajane.
“Mira,” he said firmly. “Your strength and control will be vital against these creatures.”
Mirajane straightened, nodding.

“And Leon,” Makarov continued, “you’ve faced these things before. You know their weaknesses, their patterns. That makes you the key to this mission.”
Leon exhaled slowly, already expecting what was coming.

“You two will lead the strike team.”

The guild erupted.
“OH COME ON!” Natsu shouted, slamming his fist on the table. “Why do they get to lead?!”
“Because they’re the married couple!” Cana hollered, already raising a mug.

“WE ARE NOT—!” Mira started, red-faced.
“Yet,” Leon added smoothly, smirking at her.
The guild howled, but this time the laughter was uneasy, tinged with nerves.

Because everyone could feel it now.
This wasn’t just another silly mission. This was the beginning of something big.


*The Shift

As the briefing ended, the guild dispersed in smaller groups, preparing gear and double-checking supplies.

Leon lingered by the map table, his eyes tracing the red markers of destroyed villages. His smirk was gone, replaced with the cold, calculating stare of a man who’d lived this nightmare before.

Mira approached quietly, her usual brightness dimmed. “You’ve seen this before, haven’t you?”
Leon didn’t look up. “Too many times.”
“…And it scares you.”

He finally glanced at her, surprised by the softness in her voice. She wasn’t teasing. She wasn’t mocking. She was just… there.
“More than I’d admit out loud,” he said honestly.

She smiled faintly, though her eyes were serious. “Then it’s a good thing you’re not alone this time.”

Leon blinked, caught off guard. For once, he had no smooth reply. Just a quiet nod.
The storm was coming.
And for the first time in years, Leon Kennedy wasn’t facing it alone.


Chapter 16: Sparks Before the Inferno


The sun never seemed so heavy. Clouds pressed low over Magnolia, the air damp and restless, like the city itself was holding its breath. Inside Fairy Tail’s guild hall, however, chaos reigned—not the fun, festival kind, but the desperate, sharpen-your-swords-and-pray kind.

“hey Gray, put on some clothes before the briefing!” Elfman barked, slamming his fist on the table.
Gray looked down, blinking at his bare chest. “…When did I—”

“Not the time!” Erza cut him off, her voice like steel. She was already in armor, blade polished to a shine. “Focus!”

Leon leaned against the bar, arms crossed, watching the circus with a grim sort of amusement. “So this is what pre-mission prep looks like in Fairy Tail, huh? Half strategy, half… strip show.”

“Shut it, Leon,” Gray grumbled.
Mirajane floated past, tray balanced in her hands, still smiling sweetly despite the tension. “Don’t tease them too much, Leon. Not everyone’s as calm as you are.”

Leon raised a brow. “Calm? Doll, I’m sweating bullets inside. I just hide it better.”
She gave him that look—that infuriating, knowing smile—that almost broke his composure. Almost.


*The Skirmish

The first scream came from outside the town gates.
The guild bolted into action. Natsu and Happy burst through the doors first, fire blazing around his fists. Lucy, panting, ran after them with her keys in hand.

Leon and Mira exchanged a quick glance before following, the weight of unspoken understanding between them.

At the gates, the scene was already chaos. A cluster of twisted, dog-like creatures—fur matted, limbs unnaturally long—were ripping through wooden carts. Their eyes glowed an unnatural green.

“Damn,” Leon muttered, drawing his handgun in one fluid motion. “Ganados variant. Smaller, but don’t underestimate them.”

Natsu grinned savagely. “Doesn’t matter. Fire Dragon’s—”

“DON’T get close!” Leon barked, stepping forward and firing three clean headshots. The beasts shrieked, twitching violently before collapsing.

The guild froze, startled at how clinical he was.

Leon spun his gun, holstered it, and smirked. “Lesson one, kids: aim for the head.”

Mira stepped forward, her aura shifting, demon energy spilling out as her body shifted into Satan Soul. She looked at Leon, fire in her eyes. “Lesson two: sometimes brute force works just fine.”

She slammed her fist into the ground, releasing a shockwave that flattened the remaining creatures like paper dolls.
The crowd of bystanders cheered—then shrank back as Mira’s demon form lingered longer than usual. Her eyes flickered crimson, her aura heavy and frightening.

Leon placed a steadying hand on her shoulder. “Easy, sweetheart. You’re starting to scare the kids.”

Her form flickered, then softened back to normal. She looked away, embarrassed. “…Sorry.”
Leon just grinned. “Don’t apologize. You looked hot.”

“Leon!” she hissed, cheeks burning, while the guild behind them collectively howled.

“SHUT UP!” both of them barked at the peanut gallery in unison.


*The Unease

Back inside the hall, the laughter faded quickly. Those creatures were just scouts. Everyone knew it.
Levy slammed a stack of books onto the table. “I checked every record I could find. Nothing in Fiore’s history matches these things. If they’re multiplying… we’re in trouble.”

Erza crossed her arms. “Then we prepare for war.”
“War?” Cana echoed, pouring herself another drink. “You mean one of those wars where half of us come back in bandages?”

“No,” Leon said flatly, the sharpness in his voice cutting through the chatter. “One of those wars where half of you might not come back at all.”

The guild fell into uneasy silence. Even Natsu clenched his fists, fire dimmed.
Then, of course, Happy broke the mood. “Aye! If Lucy doesn’t make it, can I have her rent money?”

“WHAT?!” Lucy shrieked, grabbing him by the tail as the hall exploded into nervous laughter.
It wasn’t much, but it was enough to let them breathe again.


*The Warning

That night, as the guild began its watch shifts, Leon stood outside on the balcony, drinking whiskey. Mira joined him quietly, her silver hair catching the moonlight.

“You ever get tired of pretending you’re not scared?” she asked softly.
He smirked sideways at her. “You ever get tired of pretending you don’t care about me?”

Her face went crimson. “…T-this isn’t about you!”

“Uh-huh.”
 “Storm’s almost here. I can feel it.”

As if on cue, a howl echoed from the distant woods. Not a normal howl. Low, distorted, almost human.
The kind of sound that made your blood run cold.
Mira’s hand unconsciously brushed against Leon’s arm. He didn’t comment on it—just let it linger.

Because they both knew.

A little background… I graduate my PA program in December and have begun my job search. I am originally from MI and am in PA school in MI, and I have never lived outside of the state. I am beginning to apply but I am trying to figure out where to and also wondering what others’ timelines looked like for securing a job. Some specific inquiries:

(1) ANY SUGGESTIONS IF WHERE TO MOVE? I don’t need all of this but I would love a community with water nearby, that I can take leisurely strolls through, with coffee and farmers markets. I love being around nature but also not so far removed from everything. I could really do with a medium size city (No NYC). As far as weather goes, I’ll take anything that is not worse than MI but not so unbearably hot in the summer. I would love to meet likeminded individuals in their 20s or 30s. 

(2) AT WHAT POINT SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT NOT SECURING AN INTERVIEW/JOB? I have begun applying and get nervous because classmates have gotten interviews and I have not gotten anything back. I am using sites like DocCafe, PracticeLink and Indeed. Any suggestions on how to further line up a job?

(3) WHAT SPECIALTY HAVE YOU ENJOYED?
I would prefer 10-12 hr shifts inpatient with potentially some clinic days. Currently looking at surgical positions, emergency department, or hospitalists.

Thank you so much for your help!

The neon sign out front flickers like it’s had too much of its own stock, casting a sickly green glow over a parking lot buried in layer after layer of snow. No one shovels it anymore. Won’t till it thaws.

Inside, it’s warm enough. It’s the kind of bar that has Wheel of Fortune playing to kill the silence. It smells like spilled beer and deep-fryer ghosts. The regulars are already settled in folks drinkin’ to remember, folks drinkin’ to forget. Me? Tonight I’m drinkin’ for both.

“What’ll it be?” Hank, the bartender, asks voice like rust on a snowplow. He’s been slingin’ beers since I was nineteen, back when you just had to nod and promise not to be a jackass. A rite of passage round these parts.

“My usual,” I say. He’s already got the Busch Light cracked before I finish the word. “And the shake of the day,” I add. Just want somethin’ to pull my brain off the spin cycle. Feels like there’s been a weight hangin’ over me lately. Like God’s draggin’ his feet gettin’ to the good parts.

Dice rattle in the cup. I’m about to roll when the door bangs open behind me. Cold air punches through the bar, wiping out the smell of farts and those cursed pickled duck eggs someone keeps buying.

“They’ll let anyone in here,” Hank mutters, dry as road salt, sarcasm seeping through his words.

I glance back. It’s my brother, Keith: blaze-orange Carhartt zipped tight, snow dustin’ his beard like powdered sugar. Grease stains on his coat probably from a Kwik Trip burger or patchin’ up a sled again.

“What’s the DNR doin’ in here?” someone behind me slurs sounds like Marty, full of Old Fashioneds and freezer pizza. Doesn’t sound like a question. More like a warning.

“Drinking off my Friday,” Keith grunts, shouldering up to the bar. He snatches the dice cup right outta my hand like he’s owed it, rolls. “Ship. Captain. No crew,” he mutters, like it means something.

I set my beer down a little too hard. Foam spills over the lip.

“Alright,” I say. “Why you really here, Keith?”

He looks at me, and there’s something wrong behind his eyes like something’s taken root and won’t let go.

“We need to talk,” he says, voice low. “About last week.”

My gut tightens.

“When we went ice fishin’.”

The words hit like a walleye through the ice cold and sudden. Before I can respond, he clamps a hand around my wrist. It’s like grabbin’ rebar in January. He pulls me off the stool and toward the door.

We pass the slot machines on the way out bells ringin’, lights flashin’ but nobody looks up. Old-timers just keep feedin’ quarters in like it’s Sunday service.

“What the hell is this about?” I ask once we’re out in the lot. Cold hits like a slap, sharp enough to sting your teeth. “The deer? You’re DNR. You’ve probably seen a dozen this week alone. Why’s this one stickin’ to your ribs?”

Keith stops. Turns real slow. His breath clouds the air like smoke off the lake.

“Why? Because we didn’t do what Grandpa would’ve done?” I offer, tryin’ to break the tension. “Didn’t toss it in the truck bed and make pocket jerky? Big deal.” But he’s not laughin’. Not even blinkin’. His jaw’s locked up like he’s chewin’ on a secret.

And in that god-awful pause I realize I don’t wanna hear whatever’s comin’.

“I don’t think it died,” he says finally.

I stare at him. Snow crunches underfoot. The whole world feels like it’s holdin’ its breath.

“Keith…” I say, gentler now. “You need a break. Maybe a vacation. Something with palm trees. That deer was mangled, man. Skull split like firewood.”

He steps closer. Snow creaks under his boots. “There’s stuff out there,” he says, voice barely a whisper. “Stuff you ain’t supposed to see, Jude.”

He digs a cigarette from his coat, lights it with one of those tiny plastic lighters. Flame flickers, catches in his eyes.

“I thought you told Karen you quit.”

He exhales. Smoke curls like a warning. “I thought deer stayed dead.”

The words hang there thin, frozen, wrong.

The bar door creaks open behind us. Warmth spills out with the stink of old smoke and fryer grease.

It’s Hank. “Judas,” he calls. Voice like gravel in a coffee can. “Call came through. I told her you weren’t here.” He squints. “You… might wanna go to church.”

I snort, but it doesn’t sound right. Hank’s compass has always pointed weird, but he follows it like gospel.

“Put it on my tab,” I say, raising my bottle. I already owe him three-fifty. What’s another five?

He looks at me too long. Snow settling in his hair like ash. Then he turns and disappears inside. Door slams behind him, dull and final.

I turn toward my truck. “Tell Dad I said hey,” I call.

Keith doesn’t answer. Just stands there, smoke curling around his face like fog. I climb in. Shut the door. The thunk of it echoes in my chest.

Engine rumbles to life. Radio kicks on. Sabbath. “I’m goin’ off the rails on a crazy train…” I hum along, pulling onto the county road.

That’s when I see it.

A deer. Dead center of the road, staring like it knows me.

I yank the wheel. Tires scream. “Jeepers cripes!” I lurch out, boots crunching in the snow.

But there’s no deer. Just a puddle of black sludge and a metal tang in the air, like burnt wires and pennies.

I step closer.

Then I hear it. Snappin’ branches. A high-pitched, garbled screech. Not quite animal. Not quite anything. Like a deer with lungs full of water, a scream whistling into the dark.

“What the hell…”

I bolt back to the truck. Slam the door. This ain’t somethin’ that stays down.

And next time I see it? I’m not bringin’ dice. I’m bringin’ buckshot.

Snow howls around me. But whatever’s out there, it’s worse. So I do what I always do: grab the shotgun from behind the seat, climb on the roof like I’m settin’ up a deer stand on four wheels, and wait.

Wind bites hard. Nothin’ comes.

“Keith’s story just rattled me,” I tell myself. But my mouth tastes off, metal, rot, burnt plastic. I’d take cold fish fry casserole over this.

I shake my head, try to shrug it off. “I don’t think it died,” his voice echoes in my skull. “No,” I mutter. “It died. We saw it die.”

But my heart’s still thumping wild, louder than the wind. And deep down, I already know: some things come back. And some never leave at all.

My cellphone buzzes in the cupholder, snapping me out of whatever trance I’d slipped into. It’s Shaniqua.

I stare at the screen for a second, then pick up. “Yellow?” I say, trying for a joke, even if it falls flat.

“As much as we hate each other,” she says, clipped and businesslike, “your dumb greeting still makes me want to roll my eyes.”

Her voice no matter how sharp always had this weird way of calming me down. Even in the worst of it. Like something from a better season.

“I’m just callin’ to let you know…” she starts, tone shifting into gear, controlled, efficient. “My parents want to see Jackie and Heidi this weekend. I know it’s your weekend, but they’ve been asking for weeks now. They haven’t seen them since… what, four Christmases ago?”

She’s always been the one to remember the important stuff. The stuff that slips through my cracks.

“Yeah,” I say. “That’s fine. Just let me have Friday night with ’em, alright? I promised I’d take ’em to the movies. They’ve been on me about that one with the guy who works in a coal mine or whatever.”

There’s a small pause. Not cold. Just… quieter.

“Alright,” she says. “Thanks, Jude.”

“Tell the girls I love ’em.”

“I will.”

The line goes dead, and I’m left sitting in the hum of the heater, staring out into the dark. Snow still falling, thick and lazy, covering everything like dust over something long dead.

I take a long, growl-filled sigh, pinching my nose. Not because my ex’s parents wanna see the kids, but because I have no clue where my life is going. Keith, Lord love him, has me spooked about a deer we killed. This and the whole week of losin’ sleep and everything feels like it’s draggin’. I needed this weekend alone.

The truck kicks back into life with a growl. The shotgun slides back into the backseat as I head back home. Whatever is happenin’, I need to get through this. The drive home is quiet no music, no one on the roads, not even a deer.

I rush back to my house, lock the door behind me, and head straight to the bedroom. The shotgun stays close to me as I plug in the girls’ old nightlight and quickly draw the shades. I sit for a long time, staring out the window like the night sky itself might blink. I feel stupid, I'm too old to be spooked by bonfire stories. I shouldn’t be scared of the dark, shouldn’t be using a child’s nightlight. But tonight, that’s what I gotta do.

I don’t remember after that. I must have fallen asleep. I wake up some time later, groggy, the world mentally in a fog. “Where am I?” I ask myself. I find myself in another room, like I’ve been sleepwalking again.

Everything around me is the same, but it feels cold, not just to the touch, but the feel of the room itself has gone cold. I stumble into the kitchen, grabbing the coffee grinds. “This oughta do the trick,” I tell myself as the coffee machine starts brewing.

The air still feels cold as I wait for the coffee, pulling any food I can from the pantry to fix this fog in my body. The stale salty jerky is soft to the touch, spicy to the tongue it reminds me of my childhood. A wrestler used to be in ads for these things; his muscular body and gravely voice always caught my attention. I remember him saying, “crying doesn’t make me less of a man, yeah.”

He ain’t wrong, but part of me can’t cry, not right now. Not while I’m unsure what the hell is goin’ on. That tohing the thing from the road keeps cutting back to my mind. It looked like a deer, but that sound… no single deer could make that sound.

As I finish the jerky, I jump at a small footstep. “Jeepers cripes!” I almost hit my head on the ceiling at the sound. I turn around to see my daughter Heidibeautiful head full of raven black hair.

“Heidi, sweetheart, you scared me.”

She doesn’t respond at first. She’s always a bit moody, but now that she’s in her teen years she’s mastered the teenage silence.

“Heidi,” I call again. Her eyes,once filled with energy. They. They're almost blank, only confusion in them.

“Daddy,” she speaks, somberly. “There was a sound.”

“A sound?” My ears perk up. Was I so lost in thought I didn’t hear it?

“What kind of sound? You can tell Pop-Pop.” I force a weak smile. She frowns like explaining what she hears would gut her like a fish. “It sounded like a scream like a deer mixed with a mountain lion,” she whimpers. “But its insides were full of Auntie’s church casserole” she can’t find the words to describe her horror, so she uses something close to us.

I put a hand on her shoulder, gentle but steady. “I’ll take care of it, kiddo. I’ll find out what causes those sounds.”

She probably knows I’m lyin’. She probably knows I’ll go outside, look around, and come back. I give a shaky, stoic smile as I walk out.

The air is cold not like a usual Wisconsin winter something colder. My breath escapes my lips like my soul is leavin’ my body. As I walk down the patio, passin’ the long-since dead blueberry plant in the colander, the ground feels covered in small twigs each step rough and sharp.

“Jeepers cripes,” I growl under my breath when I step on the twigs again; it stings my foot.

That’s where I meet whatever was making the sounds the deer. It’s standing on two legs. Its antlers are sharp points, thick like tree branches stuck out of its skull, splitting it down the middle. A tire track runs to the right before the antlers. Its breath is… collected. I try to take a step closer, but I snap another twig.

“Sonova,” I whisper as it slowly turns its head. Its neck twists slowly, bones crackin’ as it does. Its eyes are void of anything I’d call life. It starts stepping toward me, and my stomach turns like its antlers are crankin’ my insides out.

The memories come back, when Keith was drivin’, cigarette in one hand, bottle of Busch in the other. We were both drinkin’ the whole weekend, so a little drunk driving wasn’t something we’d say no to, when the car hit the deer. We hop out, look at each other, then the deer. “That’s gotta be a four-pointer,” I slur.

Keith looks frantic, the deer’s head split open from the skull, blood poolin’ a bit. He’s panicked, full of anxiety and whiskey. Keith rushes to the car, with me in pursuit.

We looked at each other, swore a vow of silence, and sped off. We didn’t stop. Hoping we didn’t get caught. DNR won’t look too good if Keith got caught drunk drivin’ down the country road with a beer in his hand.

The memory slams into me like a deer in the headlights us checkin’ the rearview, a trail of deer blood following our car. “Shit!” Keith screams Busch light breathin’ out of him. “Fuck, we gotta get outta here!” He punches the car into gear as we speed down the road, hopin’ the cold winter snow will wash away the blood.

I blink, return to reality. The deer’s still there. It opens its mouth, but no words come out no mating call just a loud, ear-piercing “EEEEEEERERRERE” a sound loud and harsh, like barbed wire rip­pin’ through my ear.

My knees damn near buckle with fear, and for a moment I’m a boy again shiverin’ in a tree stand waitin’ for Dad to tell me it’s okay to climb down. My heart quickens by the second. That’s when it starts to step forward steam risin’ off its hide like fresh pavement.

“Back off,” I mumble. It tilts its head like a dog. Its jaw begins to unhinge itself, lettin’ out another cry. “EEEEEEERERRERE.”

“Back the hell off!” I shout. I can feel the night start to squeeze around me.

My fingers tighten on the trigger as panic takes over. Smoke curls around the barrel as round after round of buckshot fires into the beast.

As the smoke dissipates, the snow starts to fall again. The beast is gone no blood, no body, just tracks. The tracks ain’t deer tracks, nor human. I smile not ’cause I’m happy, but ’cause my daughters can sleep peacefully for the night.

Then a thought hits me “My daughters.” Panic spikes. The night feels like it’s holding tighter; every move like stepping through molasses.

The house feels colder than the snow outside the kind of cold that doesn’t leave when you kick the furnace up. My breath fogs out like a ghost. Heidi’s not in the kitchen. I bolt for her room, heart thumping hard enough to rattle my ribs. I ain’t prayed in years, but I find myself mutterin’ one now Not for me. For the girls. Because if that thing got inside, it ain’t just Heidi; it’s both of ’em.

I slam into the bedroom door, shoulder first. It groans but doesn’t give. “Girls!” I bark, voice breakin’. I hit it again wood splinterin’. Third try and it cracks open.

The room’s empty. Sheets half-pulled, the window gaping wide. Snow spills in like ash. On the floor, Heidi’s stuffed bear. I pick it up, fingers numb. “No… no, no, no.”

“HEIDI!!” I call through the house. The thought of that thing havin’ her eat­ing her makes my mind falter. I pull the sheets off the bed, hopin’ either girl is there. Pillow there. No Heidi. No Jackie. My throat locks up.

There’s a lump under the blanket on the bed. My chest caves as I pull it back. Just pillows. No girls. I check the closet dresses and school clothes sway in the cold breeze.

Then I hear it muffled, thin: “Daddy…”

I freeze. It’s comin’ from below.

The basement door’s cracked; light spills like swamp water down the steps. I take them two at a time, shotgun ready. Broken glass crunches under my boots old whiskey bottles I never tossed. Under the workbench, small slippers peek out Jackie’s.

She turns when I reach,her hazel eyes wide and wet. Heidi huddled beside her.

“Dad… is the bad man gone?” Jackie whispers. Her voice don’t sound right.

My knees damn near give. I kneel down, gather ’em both close. Their pajamas warm against me, the only heat in the room.

“What happened?” I ask.

Heidi just shakes her head, lips quiverin’. Jackie answers for her. “The bad man was lookin’ in our window. We ran down here when it screamed.” She points to the bottles on the floor. “Then it banged around the window,” she sniffles. Her finger points to my whisky bottles. “And your silly juice spilled.”

I hold ’em tighter. “Don’t matter. You did the right thing.” I force the most reassuring voice I got. “Are we safe?” Jackie asks, small.

I look down at cracked cement, the dim bulb swayin’ overhead, the smell of cold ash in the air. “Course we are,” I say, forcing a grin I don’t feel. “Daddy scared him off.” I flex my arm like I used to when they were barely able to walk and chew gum. They give a weak smile back. It’s enough.

Later, we crowd into my room the smallest one in the house. Walls cluttered with old photos, the dumb singin’ bass the girls bought me one Father’s Day. Heidi nods off first raven hair tangled across her face. Jackie fights it a little longer, then curls into my side.

“Sleep, princess,” I whisper. “Daddy’ll be right here.”

I lay there until the sun drags itself over the cornfields, its beams start to chase away the cold. It’s a slow warmth, like the first sip of coffee on a white-winter morning. Despite the energy spent, I can’t sleep. My mind’s plagued with the beast outside the girls’ window, the sound it made. More thoughts come to me. about Keith’s pale blue eyes, his panic, how he and I both saw this thing and neither knew what to do.

I sneak out of bed, Heidi and Jackie’s heads fall off my chest and onto the pillows, their tiny bodies make my bed look smaller. I grab my phone and call the one voice I didn’t think I would my ex. She’s the only safe person I got right now, and knowin’ she knows the girls are safe is enough.

She don’t answer straight to voicemail.

“Shaniqua, hey, so somethin’ came up. I won’t be in town for a few days.” I’m only half-lyin’. “Can you watch the girls a bit longer?” My voice is shaky. “Call me when you get ’em.”

Voicemail clicks. I feel exhausted, really unwell and spent. I think whatever that was it’s causin’ it.

The coffee pot bubbles as I prepare the girls’ school lunches. I write a note on each one: I love you. You’ll be stayin’ with Mom for a bit. As I step outside, the cold snow pelts me. My phone buzzes. Part of me hopes it’s Shaniqua, but in my heart I know who it is.

The image on my phone is Keith’s goofy full-mouth smile him with his old huntin’ dog in his arms like a baby. “Keith. Are you okay?” I answer.

“Jude,” he calls back, almost a hush. “You saw it, didn’t you?” Before I can answer, he keeps talkin’. I clutch my phone tight until my knuckles go white. “I think I think it’s mad at us,” he whimpers.

My mind flashes back to that damn night the car, the skid, the full thump, Keith sweatin’. Headlights wash the snowfall red. For a second I hear an animal cry. I shake myself awake. “Where are you?” I ask.

“Old town road. By Dad’s old huntin’ cabin,” he groans. There’s a loud growl in the phone, not Keith’s, not the dog’s something familiar and wrong.

I quickly grab a cup of coffee to go and lock the doors behind me. I know Shaniqua’ll kill me if I don’t have a sitter for the girls. Thankfully Mom ain’t got nothin’ but Wheel of Fortune tonight. “Ma. Hey. How’s Dad? Anyways Keith’s been bugging me about goin’ huntin’ with him. I can’t go without a sitter. Suppose you watch the girls till she comes? I’ll pay ya.” She says the girls are asleep and the keys are in the usual spot.

I don’t give Mom a second to respond; I kick the engine into life. Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train” picks up again. As I speed down the road, I pass the usual spots Fleet Farm, Kwik Trip, Culver’s with the busted neon “ButterBurgers” sign but none of it feels real. Just landmarks in a dream I’m tryin’ to wake from.

County roads stretch on, empty. Snow spits sideways, headlights cut a narrow tunnel. The closer I get to the cabin, the more the woods lean in pines bend low, branches scrap at the glass like they’re tryin’ to pull me off the road. Dad’s old cabin sits at the end of a two-track trail, roof sagging under years of snow and silence. My tires crunch to a stop.

I grab the shotgun, step into the cold. It hits sharper here. Deader. My breath fogs out thick, clingin’ to my beard.",1,1758815944.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

It’s marketed as harmless, but spiritually, mentally, and physically it’s a heavy hit. Coffee floods your system with stress hormones, spikes & crashes your energy, and hooks you into a cycle of dependency. Spiritually, it overstimulates the nervous system, clouds intuition, and keeps you in fight-or-flight rather than flow. It’s not gentle focus — it’s a chemical jolt, closer to a mini drug rush than mindful energy.

💛 Your body deserves better fuel.

My sister and I are in our mid 30s  early 40s. We are going to just relax in October. We don't mind the hussle as we are familiar with NYC rush and speed. So slowing down will be an adjustment for us but we are looking forward to it.

1. I'm supposely arriving there early on a Wednesday. I'm staying at La Cabana due to having a kitchen and being near Eagle Beach and Palm Beach. Do they let us check in early, it says check in is at 4pm but I'll land at around 12pm? If not, any suggestion in what I can do for 4 hours with a luggage beside travel to the resort area? 
2. ED Card - I know I need to apply when coming in. I read I can do it 7 days beforehand. However, do I need to fill it out again when leaving? If so, can I fill it out early or at the same time as I'm coming in since I'm only there for 5 nights
3. Any restaurants anyone can suggest that is budget friendly? Any hidden gems? Also, any late night restaurants. I'm used to eating at 8pm or later, and notice things seem to end around 5pm. 
4. De Palm Island vs Renassiance Island? I want to go see the flamingos, is it worth going to both, or one vs another.
5. I also notice La Cabana main pool is getting renovated. I don't think I'll need the pool but do places like Eagle, Holiday, Hilton, or any other hotel nearby let us use the pool for a small fee or if I plan to dine in their area?
6. I have to do some work that requires internet. Is there a nice coffee shop or area that I can do work in, as one of my work day is when I'm checking out. 
7. Excursions - I'm looking at Trip advisor for most of the excursion and some require for me to drive at the location for pick up. Is there a lot of traffic if I rent a car? Is there parking to leave my car (Divi golf area), is free or metered/pay station. Is there other places people might recommend to look for excursions. 
8. Car rental - Is it better to rent with Costco, Expedia, or locally?
9. Bus - if we don't get a car, is the bus running often and on time?
10. Can I bring ramen/spam into aruba? I know the convience of getting at the supermarket there but I tend to stock up of this and we tend to pack them when we travel for last minute bites.

Give me any advice that I might be missing out. I'm sure I'll have more questions later on. Thank you in advance! ",1,1758815873.0,Aruba,5,1.0,False

Now, I have a question: When do you think I should use my Ceramic switch, & when should I use my plastic Mugen, and why?  
Both practical & detailed-physical answers will be appreciated.

\*Bonus question\*: if my full-immersion brew doesn't have high clarity (just simply ""sweet"", no prominent taste notes at all), even after I change my grind-size, what other brewing method & recipe I should try immediately for the next brew, in general?

Right out of the gate, one of the first sentences she says about the sometimes nutty traffic in the area is, “well, because we’re ***old***, it affects us differently”. I’m thinking ****ugh***, WTH? I’m not old (mindset is key for me, number one - it speaks volumes about a person as a whole). 

You can be 20 with the mindset of an “old” person or 80 with the mindset of a 30 year old. You get what I’m saying? (And we’re both in our 40’s).

Low, downer energy. She talks negatively about herself (many times) due to her lot in life, how she and her spouse struggle with one income, her weight, how she doesn’t fit in with the other moms at her kids new school, tries to lighten it up with weak “humor”, etc…. I didn’t laugh once or feel a real connection. She said she has ADD and kept interrupting me nonstop. 

She’s a nice lady overall after a couple of hours chatting, but I felt a bit drained, and under/overwhelmed by her energy. We are very different in so many ways. 
 
After the hang, I went to a market next door to the cafe use the bathroom and who do I see? Her, again. Ugh. Was she following me? lol 
As we’re parting ways (again), she says - twice - I love you. 😳 

I told my husband and he was like ***wth*** as well. 

Again, this is a former coworker’s longtime friend from back home but I ***really*** can’t see myself hanging out with her or wanting to pursue a deeper connection. She is nice but is not the type of healthy, ambitious, energizing friend I need or want (I have loads of energy). I need to gently nip this in the bud. 

How do I start to keep this person at bay in a polite way? It’s sad because we’re both new in town, her more so than me, but I just can’t have this person in my life… Thanks for reading. ",2,1758815707.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I recently had the opportunity to do a deep dive on the Washed Geisha from Diego Horta, roasted by Un.Common in Amsterdam, and I wanted to share my findings and brewing protocol with the community here.

**Coffee Details:**

* **Roaster:** Un.Common (Amsterdam, NL)
* **Producer:** Diego Horta
* **Varietal:** Geisha
* **Process:** Multi-stage Anaerobic Washed (24hr oxidation, 36hr anaerobic fermentation)

**Grinding & Extraction Analysis:** My primary grinder for this was a Fellow Ode Gen 2 with Gen 2 burrs. I found that manually slow-feeding the beans at a rate of approximately 5-7 beans/sec significantly narrowed the particle distribution. While the burr gap was set to \~607μm (setting 5), the resulting nominal peak particle size, measured post-brew, was closer to 723μm.

**Brewing Protocol:**

* **Brewer:** Hario V60 (Glass)
* **Filter:** Sibarist B3 Hybrid (with Booster 22)
* **Dose:** 15g
* **Water:** 232.5g (1:15.5 ratio) @ 195°F (90.5°C), composed from deionized water + Third Wave Water mineralization.
* **Pour Structure:**
   * *(Note: All direct kettle pours are at a target flow rate of \~6g/sec.)*
   * **0:00 - 0:45 »** 45s bloom (approx. 45g) using a Pulsar dispersion screen.
   * **0:45 - 1:15 »** First pour to 180g. This is a direct kettle pour focused on the center of the bed to increase agitation and promote a higher, more even extraction.
   * **1:30 - 2:00 »** Final pour to 232.5g using the dispersion screen again for a gentle finish.
   * **Target Brew Time:** \~2:30

**Results:**

* **TDS:** Consistently measured at 1.32%.
* **Extraction Yield:** Calculated between 19.5% and 20%.
* **Tasting Notes:** The resulting cup is exceptionally elegant and aromatic. The profile is dominated by bright lime, with a complex floral finish of verbena. If you've ever had DAK's Botanica and White Lotus, it is reminiscent of an 80/20 blend of those respectively. 

I'm interested to hear if others have had similar experiences with advanced fermentation Geishas.",3,1758815674.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1nqai4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightlossdiets/comments/1nqai4u/why_most_people_fail_to_lose_belly_fat_and_what/,Why Most People Fail to Lose Belly Fat (and What Actually Works),"If you’ve ever tried dieting, working out for hours, or even skipping meals… yet still couldn’t lose that stubborn belly fat, you’re not alone.

In fact, belly fat is one of the hardest areas to target and the truth is, most people are going about it the wrong way. Let’s break it down.

The Real Problem Isn’t Just Calories

Yes, calories matter. But if fat loss was only about eating less, we’d all have six-packs by now. The real problem lies in how your body processes food, stores energy, and burns fat while you rest.

👉 Hormones like insulin, cortisol, and leptin play a massive role. If these are out of balance due to poor sleep, stress, or processed foods, your body starts holding onto fat especially around the belly.

Mistake #1: Ignoring Sleep

You can crush your workouts and eat salads all day, but if you’re not sleeping well, fat loss becomes almost impossible.
Poor sleep disrupts hormones.
Cravings shoot up.
Your body stores more fat for ""emergency energy"".
Quality sleep isn’t a luxury it’s a fat loss tool.

Mistake #2: Doing Too Much Cardio

Hours on the treadmill might burn calories short-term, but it also raises cortisol. High cortisol = more belly fat storage.
➡️ Strength training + walking is a better combo. Build muscle → boost metabolism → burn fat even at rest.

Mistake #3: Skipping Protein

Protein doesn’t just build muscle it controls hunger and stabilizes blood sugar. If you start your day with just coffee or bread, expect cravings later.
➡️ Instead, try eggs, Greek yogurt, or even a protein shake in the morning.

So… What Actually Works?

The people who successfully lose belly fat focus on 3 main things:

1. Consistent quality sleep 🌙

2. Balanced meals with enough protein 🥩

3. Movement that reduces stress, not adds more 🚶‍♂️💪


These are the foundation. Once these are in place, diet and workouts start giving results much faster.


Final Thoughts

Losing belly fat isn’t about starving yourself or killing it in the gym. It’s about creating an environment where your body wants to burn fat naturally.

Start small fix your sleep, move daily, eat balanced meals and watch the changes stack up.

1nqaho4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1nqaho4/religious_trauma/,Religious Trauma,"I am unsure of where to start with this but I am looking for some insight, advice, support, etc. 

Backstory, me and my man have been together for 8.5 years including our dating period, we are high school sweethearts. We have a 7 month old daughter. When we met (16 & 17), he opened up about religious trauma when he was younger. He was forced to go to church multiple times a week which led to him not having a normal childhood, not being able to do certain things. His mother was very forceful about going to church and never gave an option, so he and his sisters would act sick or find a different excuse. His parents divorced before he was even 1, and he has 2 older sisters. His sisters were not the greatest influence to him and I do feel caused some havoc with going to church and influencing him on certain matters, which I feel has affected him to this day. They are both liberals and I would say heavily involved with the New Age. They definitely are not believers. My husband on the other hand is conservative and says that he believes in God, but hasn't really given me much more than that. He is a wonderful man, and I love him dearly. He is a great father and takes care of us well. We follow traditional roles in our home and share the same core values which is important to the both of us. 

Now some info on me. I grew up in a Christian family, my parents never took me or my sister to church, but when we would visit our grandparents we would attend on Sundays and Wednesdays until we were of age to decide if we wanted to go or not. I was still on the younger side and knew of Jesus but was not saved or baptized. In high school, I drifted away from that, as I made the decision not to attend church. I did go once with a friend, but it did not stick. In Summer 2023, is when I began to find my faith in my adult life and bought my first Bible. I started doing studies with my friend and she has taught me so much. We were not married at this time, but my husband never made me feel bad for doing this. I feel like it was more so he just didn't understand why.

My faith has grown since but has definitely been a rollecoaster. My friend started to invite me to church in Fall 2024, which is when I was in the middle of my pregnancy. Me and my husband talked and he said that once our daughter was born, if I was still going to church that I can take her. I stopped going to church at the end of 2024 because I used to the pregnancy excuse (bad I know, I wish I could go back and change it). And just this past Sunday, was my first time back in church. I do feel the CK incident pushed me to go back which it shouldn't have taken that to get me to go back, but needless to say I am happy I went and ripped the bandaid off again.

This is where I am looking for the insight and support. On Saturday, we went to bed completely normal and did not have any disagreements or anything. I was up first on Sunday, and made coffee and breakfast and he woke up in a mood. I had an idea of why he might be feeling that way but I continued on with my morning. I started to get anxious about going to back to church but remained stoic. I got me and my daughter ready and went to go kiss my husband goodbye. I said ""I love you"" and he just said ""bye"" (which rarely happens. If it does it is for a reason) until I looked at him alitte longer then got a ""I love you"". I tried to brush it off which I did because my anxiety was really high and I was just trying to think about how I will get through a service with a 7 month old who has already been up for 2+ hours and probably will not fall asleep (which she didn't lol). On my drive he texted me, he asked why I can't find a church near us. (My church is only 20 minutes away) I told him I know this church and haven't looked in closer churches and left it at that because I was still driving then he texted lol which he does not do normally only if he is feeling some type of way. I just told him we arrived and left it at that. I get through the service, get home and we didn't discuss what was said, and I didn't want to come off as a quarrelsome wife so I just kept going on throughout the day and it did get better. 

But that conversation and his attitude sat with me until last night when I finally asked him why he was being mean to me on Sunday. He said he wasn't but I asked him again and he finally said because it reminded him of his childhood. So I asked him are you going to do that everytime? I am not sure if that was the right thing to say but it was left at that and we continued with dinner and our evening as normal. We are fine this morning. we haven't fought . But I can't understand for the life of me how I triggered him. He's done a couple things in the past few months, where I thought he was coming to Christ on his own. We went shopping the weekend before last and he told me he could see me wearing a shirt that he found. It said faith over fear with a crown of thorns on the front. I ended up buying it and have worn it since. But the church thing came out of left field. I don't know if I remind him of his mom even though I try to not do ""motherly"" things for him. That is something that I have been working on since we have been together. I never forced him with his faith or to pursue it or to go to church. I have prayed for him that he has an encounter with God. I don't know if he is scared that our daughter will grow up the same way he did and she'll have to deal with this in the future. I don't know. I am maybe looking to see if anyone else has stories of people with religous trauma coming to Christ eventually or just words of wisdom. I've prayed for him, not as much as I should be honestly. My prayer life is lacking overall. But I dedicated my journal entry to him this morning. This incident has not changed my mind about going to church, just trying to get an outside perspective. I don't want to pry in a way that might reverse any progress he has made on his own.",1,1758815628.0,Christianity,2,1.0,False

1nqagbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Sorbet5257/comments/1nqagbz/death_rattle_part_1/,Death rattle part 1,"Acouple miles outside Ashwaubenon, WI, there’s this dive called the Rutten Buck. Been there since before the bypass went in. The neon sign out front flickers like it’s had too much of its own stock, casting a sickly green glow over a parking lot buried in layer after layer of snow. No one shovels it anymore. Won’t till it thaws.

Inside, it’s warm enough. It’s the kind of bar that has Wheel of Fortune playing to kill the silence. It smells like spilled beer and deep-fryer ghosts. The regulars are already settled in folks drinkin’ to remember, folks drinkin’ to forget. Me? Tonight I’m drinkin’ for both.

“What’ll it be?” Hank, the bartender, asks voice like rust on a snowplow. He’s been slingin’ beers since I was nineteen, back when you just had to nod and promise not to be a jackass. A rite of passage round these parts.

“My usual,” I say. He’s already got the Busch Light cracked before I finish the word. “And the shake of the day,” I add. Just want somethin’ to pull my brain off the spin cycle. Feels like there’s been a weight hangin’ over me lately. Like God’s draggin’ his feet gettin’ to the good parts.

Dice rattle in the cup. I’m about to roll when the door bangs open behind me. Cold air punches through the bar, wiping out the smell of farts and those cursed pickled duck eggs someone keeps buying.

“They’ll let anyone in here,” Hank mutters, dry as road salt, sarcasm seeping through his words.

I glance back. It’s my brother, Keith: blaze-orange Carhartt zipped tight, snow dustin’ his beard like powdered sugar. Grease stains on his coat probably from a Kwik Trip burger or patchin’ up a sled again.

“What’s the DNR doin’ in here?” someone behind me slurs sounds like Marty, full of Old Fashioneds and freezer pizza. Doesn’t sound like a question. More like a warning.

“Drinking off my Friday,” Keith grunts, shouldering up to the bar. He snatches the dice cup right outta my hand like he’s owed it, rolls. “Ship. Captain. No crew,” he mutters, like it means something.

I set my beer down a little too hard. Foam spills over the lip.

“Alright,” I say. “Why you really here, Keith?”

He looks at me, and there’s something wrong behind his eyes like something’s taken root and won’t let go.

“We need to talk,” he says, voice low. “About last week.”

My gut tightens.

“When we went ice fishin’.”

The words hit like a walleye through the ice cold and sudden. Before I can respond, he clamps a hand around my wrist. It’s like grabbin’ rebar in January. He pulls me off the stool and toward the door.

We pass the slot machines on the way out bells ringin’, lights flashin’ but nobody looks up. Old-timers just keep feedin’ quarters in like it’s Sunday service.

“What the hell is this about?” I ask once we’re out in the lot. Cold hits like a slap, sharp enough to sting your teeth. “The deer? You’re DNR. You’ve probably seen a dozen this week alone. Why’s this one stickin’ to your ribs?”

Keith stops. Turns real slow. His breath clouds the air like smoke off the lake.

“Why? Because we didn’t do what Grandpa would’ve done?” I offer, tryin’ to break the tension. “Didn’t toss it in the truck bed and make pocket jerky? Big deal.” But he’s not laughin’. Not even blinkin’. His jaw’s locked up like he’s chewin’ on a secret.

And in that god-awful pause I realize I don’t wanna hear whatever’s comin’.

“I don’t think it died,” he says finally.

I stare at him. Snow crunches underfoot. The whole world feels like it’s holdin’ its breath.

“Keith…” I say, gentler now. “You need a break. Maybe a vacation. Something with palm trees. That deer was mangled, man. Skull split like firewood.”

He steps closer. Snow creaks under his boots. “There’s stuff out there,” he says, voice barely a whisper. “Stuff you ain’t supposed to see, Jude.”

He digs a cigarette from his coat, lights it with one of those tiny plastic lighters. Flame flickers, catches in his eyes.

“I thought you told Karen you quit.”

He exhales. Smoke curls like a warning. “I thought deer stayed dead.”

The words hang there thin, frozen, wrong.

The bar door creaks open behind us. Warmth spills out with the stink of old smoke and fryer grease.

It’s Hank. “Judas,” he calls. Voice like gravel in a coffee can. “Call came through. I told her you weren’t here.” He squints. “You… might wanna go to church.”

I snort, but it doesn’t sound right. Hank’s compass has always pointed weird, but he follows it like gospel.

“Put it on my tab,” I say, raising my bottle. I already owe him three-fifty. What’s another five?

He looks at me too long. Snow settling in his hair like ash. Then he turns and disappears inside. Door slams behind him, dull and final.

I turn toward my truck. “Tell Dad I said hey,” I call.

Keith doesn’t answer. Just stands there, smoke curling around his face like fog. I climb in. Shut the door. The thunk of it echoes in my chest.

Engine rumbles to life. Radio kicks on. Sabbath. “I’m goin’ off the rails on a crazy train…” I hum along, pulling onto the county road.

That’s when I see it.

A deer. Dead center of the road, staring like it knows me.

I yank the wheel. Tires scream. “Jeepers cripes!” I lurch out, boots crunching in the snow.

But there’s no deer. Just a puddle of black sludge and a metal tang in the air, like burnt wires and pennies.

I step closer.

Then I hear it. Snappin’ branches. A high-pitched, garbled screech. Not quite animal. Not quite anything. Like a deer with lungs full of water, a scream whistling into the dark.

“What the hell…”

I bolt back to the truck. Slam the door. This ain’t somethin’ that stays down.

And next time I see it? I’m not bringin’ dice. I’m bringin’ buckshot.

Snow howls around me. But whatever’s out there, it’s worse. So I do what I always do: grab the shotgun from behind the seat, climb on the roof like I’m settin’ up a deer stand on four wheels, and wait.

Wind bites hard. Nothin’ comes.

“Keith’s story just rattled me,” I tell myself. But my mouth tastes off, metal, rot, burnt plastic. I’d take cold fish fry casserole over this.

I shake my head, try to shrug it off. “I don’t think it died,” his voice echoes in my skull. “No,” I mutter. “It died. We saw it die.”

But my heart’s still thumping wild, louder than the wind. And deep down, I already know: some things come back. And some never leave at all.

My cellphone buzzes in the cupholder, snapping me out of whatever trance I’d slipped into. It’s Shaniqua.

I stare at the screen for a second, then pick up. “Yellow?” I say, trying for a joke, even if it falls flat.

“As much as we hate each other,” she says, clipped and businesslike, “your dumb greeting still makes me want to roll my eyes.”

Her voice no matter how sharp always had this weird way of calming me down. Even in the worst of it. Like something from a better season.

“I’m just callin’ to let you know…” she starts, tone shifting into gear, controlled, efficient. “My parents want to see Jackie and Heidi this weekend. I know it’s your weekend, but they’ve been asking for weeks now. They haven’t seen them since… what, four Christmases ago?”

She’s always been the one to remember the important stuff. The stuff that slips through my cracks.

“Yeah,” I say. “That’s fine. Just let me have Friday night with ’em, alright? I promised I’d take ’em to the movies. They’ve been on me about that one with the guy who works in a coal mine or whatever.”

There’s a small pause. Not cold. Just… quieter.

“Alright,” she says. “Thanks, Jude.”

“Tell the girls I love ’em.”

“I will.”

The line goes dead, and I’m left sitting in the hum of the heater, staring out into the dark. Snow still falling, thick and lazy, covering everything like dust over something long dead.

I take a long, growl-filled sigh, pinching my nose. Not because my ex’s parents wanna see the kids, but because I have no clue where my life is going. Keith, Lord love him, has me spooked about a deer we killed. This and the whole week of losin’ sleep and everything feels like it’s draggin’. I needed this weekend alone.

The truck kicks back into life with a growl. The shotgun slides back into the backseat as I head back home. Whatever is happenin’, I need to get through this. The drive home is quiet no music, no one on the roads, not even a deer.

I rush back to my house, lock the door behind me, and head straight to the bedroom. The shotgun stays close to me as I plug in the girls’ old nightlight and quickly draw the shades. I sit for a long time, staring out the window like the night sky itself might blink. I feel stupid, I'm too old to be spooked by bonfire stories. I shouldn’t be scared of the dark, shouldn’t be using a child’s nightlight. But tonight, that’s what I gotta do.

I don’t remember after that. I must have fallen asleep. I wake up some time later, groggy, the world mentally in a fog. “Where am I?” I ask myself. I find myself in another room, like I’ve been sleepwalking again.

Everything around me is the same, but it feels cold, not just to the touch, but the feel of the room itself has gone cold. I stumble into the kitchen, grabbing the coffee grinds. “This oughta do the trick,” I tell myself as the coffee machine starts brewing.

The air still feels cold as I wait for the coffee, pulling any food I can from the pantry to fix this fog in my body. The stale salty jerky is soft to the touch, spicy to the tongue it reminds me of my childhood. A wrestler used to be in ads for these things; his muscular body and gravely voice always caught my attention. I remember him saying, “crying doesn’t make me less of a man, yeah.”

He ain’t wrong, but part of me can’t cry, not right now. Not while I’m unsure what the hell is goin’ on. That tohing the thing from the road keeps cutting back to my mind. It looked like a deer, but that sound… no single deer could make that sound.

As I finish the jerky, I jump at a small footstep. “Jeepers cripes!” I almost hit my head on the ceiling at the sound. I turn around to see my daughter Heidibeautiful head full of raven black hair.

“Heidi, sweetheart, you scared me.”

She doesn’t respond at first. She’s always a bit moody, but now that she’s in her teen years she’s mastered the teenage silence.

“Heidi,” I call again. Her eyes,once filled with energy. They. They're almost blank, only confusion in them. 

“Daddy,” she speaks, somberly. “There was a sound.”

“A sound?” My ears perk up. Was I so lost in thought I didn’t hear it?

“What kind of sound? You can tell Pop-Pop.” I force a weak smile. She frowns like explaining what she hears would gut her like a fish. “It sounded like a scream like a deer mixed with a mountain lion,” she whimpers. “But its insides were full of Auntie’s church casserole” she can’t find the words to describe her horror, so she uses something close to us.

I put a hand on her shoulder, gentle but steady. “I’ll take care of it, kiddo. I’ll find out what causes those sounds.”

She probably knows I’m lyin’. She probably knows I’ll go outside, look around, and come back. I give a shaky, stoic smile as I walk out.

The air is cold not like a usual Wisconsin winter something colder. My breath escapes my lips like my soul is leavin’ my body. As I walk down the patio, passin’ the long-since dead blueberry plant in the colander, the ground feels covered in small twigs each step rough and sharp.

“Jeepers cripes,” I growl under my breath when I step on the twigs again; it stings my foot.

That’s where I meet whatever was making the sounds the deer. It’s standing on two legs. Its antlers are sharp points, thick like tree branches stuck out of its skull, splitting it down the middle. A tire track runs to the right before the antlers. Its breath is… collected. I try to take a step closer, but I snap another twig.

“Sonova,” I whisper as it slowly turns its head. Its neck twists slowly, bones crackin’ as it does. Its eyes are void of anything I’d call life. It starts stepping toward me, and my stomach turns like its antlers are crankin’ my insides out.

The memories come back, when Keith was drivin’, cigarette in one hand, bottle of Busch in the other. We were both drinkin’ the whole weekend, so a little drunk driving wasn’t something we’d say no to, when the car hit the deer. We hop out, look at each other, then the deer. “That’s gotta be a four-pointer,” I slur.

Keith looks frantic, the deer’s head split open from the skull, blood poolin’ a bit. He’s panicked, full of anxiety and whiskey. Keith rushes to the car, with me in pursuit.

We looked at each other, swore a vow of silence, and sped off. We didn’t stop. Hoping we didn’t get caught. DNR won’t look too good if Keith got caught drunk drivin’ down the country road with a beer in his hand.

The memory slams into me like a deer in the headlights us checkin’ the rearview, a trail of deer blood following our car. “Shit!” Keith screams Busch light breathin’ out of him. “Fuck, we gotta get outta here!” He punches the car into gear as we speed down the road, hopin’ the cold winter snow will wash away the blood.

I blink, return to reality. The deer’s still there. It opens its mouth, but no words come out no mating call just a loud, ear-piercing “EEEEEEERERRERE” a sound loud and harsh, like barbed wire rip­pin’ through my ear.

My knees damn near buckle with fear, and for a moment I’m a boy again shiverin’ in a tree stand waitin’ for Dad to tell me it’s okay to climb down. My heart quickens by the second. That’s when it starts to step forward steam risin’ off its hide like fresh pavement.

“Back off,” I mumble. It tilts its head like a dog. Its jaw begins to unhinge itself, lettin’ out another cry. “EEEEEEERERRERE.”

“Back the hell off!” I shout. I can feel the night start to squeeze around me.

My fingers tighten on the trigger as panic takes over. Smoke curls around the barrel as round after round of buckshot fires into the beast.

As the smoke dissipates, the snow starts to fall again. The beast is gone no blood, no body, just tracks. The tracks ain’t deer tracks, nor human. I smile not ’cause I’m happy, but ’cause my daughters can sleep peacefully for the night.

Then a thought hits me “My daughters.” Panic spikes. The night feels like it’s holding tighter; every move like stepping through molasses.

The house feels colder than the snow outside the kind of cold that doesn’t leave when you kick the furnace up. My breath fogs out like a ghost. Heidi’s not in the kitchen. I bolt for her room, heart thumping hard enough to rattle my ribs. I ain’t prayed in years, but I find myself mutterin’ one now Not for me. For the girls. Because if that thing got inside, it ain’t just Heidi; it’s both of ’em.

I slam into the bedroom door, shoulder first. It groans but doesn’t give. “Girls!” I bark, voice breakin’. I hit it again wood splinterin’. Third try and it cracks open.

The room’s empty. Sheets half-pulled, the window gaping wide. Snow spills in like ash. On the floor, Heidi’s stuffed bear. I pick it up, fingers numb. “No… no, no, no.”

“HEIDI!!” I call through the house. The thought of that thing havin’ her eat­ing her makes my mind falter. I pull the sheets off the bed, hopin’ either girl is there. Pillow there. No Heidi. No Jackie. My throat locks up.

There’s a lump under the blanket on the bed. My chest caves as I pull it back. Just pillows. No girls. I check the closet dresses and school clothes sway in the cold breeze.

Then I hear it muffled, thin: “Daddy…”

I freeze. It’s comin’ from below.

The basement door’s cracked; light spills like swamp water down the steps. I take them two at a time, shotgun ready. Broken glass crunches under my boots old whiskey bottles I never tossed. Under the workbench, small slippers peek out Jackie’s.

She turns when I reach,her hazel eyes wide and wet. Heidi huddled beside her.

“Dad… is the bad man gone?” Jackie whispers. Her voice don’t sound right.

My knees damn near give. I kneel down, gather ’em both close. Their pajamas warm against me, the only heat in the room.

“What happened?” I ask.

Heidi just shakes her head, lips quiverin’. Jackie answers for her. “The bad man was lookin’ in our window. We ran down here when it screamed.” She points to the bottles on the floor. “Then it banged around the window,” she sniffles. Her finger points to my whisky bottles. “And your silly juice spilled.”

I hold ’em tighter. “Don’t matter. You did the right thing.” I force the most reassuring voice I got. “Are we safe?” Jackie asks, small.

I look down at cracked cement, the dim bulb swayin’ overhead, the smell of cold ash in the air. “Course we are,” I say, forcing a grin I don’t feel. “Daddy scared him off.” I flex my arm like I used to when they were barely able to walk and chew gum. They give a weak smile back. It’s enough.

Later, we crowd into my room the smallest one in the house. Walls cluttered with old photos, the dumb singin’ bass the girls bought me one Father’s Day. Heidi nods off first raven hair tangled across her face. Jackie fights it a little longer, then curls into my side.

“Sleep, princess,” I whisper. “Daddy’ll be right here.”

I lay there until the sun drags itself over the cornfields, its beams start to chase away the cold. It’s a slow warmth, like the first sip of coffee on a white-winter morning. Despite the energy spent, I can’t sleep. My mind’s plagued with the beast outside the girls’ window, the sound it made. More thoughts come to me. about Keith’s pale blue eyes, his panic, how he and I both saw this thing and neither knew what to do.

I sneak out of bed, Heidi and Jackie’s heads fall off my chest and onto the pillows, their tiny bodies make my bed look smaller. I grab my phone and call the one voice I didn’t think I would my ex. She’s the only safe person I got right now, and knowin’ she knows the girls are safe is enough.

She don’t answer straight to voicemail.

“Shaniqua, hey, so somethin’ came up. I won’t be in town for a few days.” I’m only half-lyin’. “Can you watch the girls a bit longer?” My voice is shaky. “Call me when you get ’em.”

Voicemail clicks. I feel exhausted, really unwell and spent. I think whatever that was it’s causin’ it.

The coffee pot bubbles as I prepare the girls’ school lunches. I write a note on each one: I love you. You’ll be stayin’ with Mom for a bit. As I step outside, the cold snow pelts me. My phone buzzes. Part of me hopes it’s Shaniqua, but in my heart I know who it is.

The image on my phone is Keith’s goofy full-mouth smile him with his old huntin’ dog in his arms like a baby. “Keith. Are you okay?” I answer.

“Jude,” he calls back, almost a hush. “You saw it, didn’t you?” Before I can answer, he keeps talkin’. I clutch my phone tight until my knuckles go white. “I think I think it’s mad at us,” he whimpers.

My mind flashes back to that damn night the car, the skid, the full thump, Keith sweatin’. Headlights wash the snowfall red. For a second I hear an animal cry. I shake myself awake. “Where are you?” I ask.

“Old town road. By Dad’s old huntin’ cabin,” he groans. There’s a loud growl in the phone, not Keith’s, not the dog’s something familiar and wrong.

I quickly grab a cup of coffee to go and lock the doors behind me. I know Shaniqua’ll kill me if I don’t have a sitter for the girls. Thankfully Mom ain’t got nothin’ but Wheel of Fortune tonight. “Ma. Hey. How’s Dad? Anyways Keith’s been bugging me about goin’ huntin’ with him. I can’t go without a sitter. Suppose you watch the girls till she comes? I’ll pay ya.” She says the girls are asleep and the keys are in the usual spot.

I don’t give Mom a second to respond; I kick the engine into life. Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train” picks up again. As I speed down the road, I pass the usual spots Fleet Farm, Kwik Trip, Culver’s with the busted neon “ButterBurgers” sign but none of it feels real. Just landmarks in a dream I’m tryin’ to wake from.

County roads stretch on, empty. Snow spits sideways, headlights cut a narrow tunnel. The closer I get to the cabin, the more the woods lean in pines bend low, branches scrap at the glass like they’re tryin’ to pull me off the road. Dad’s old cabin sits at the end of a two-track trail, roof sagging under years of snow and silence. My tires crunch to a stop.

I grab the shotgun, step into the cold. It hits sharper here. Deader. My breath fogs out thick, clingin’ to my beard.

I honestly feel like my body is plotting against me every month. Having dysmenorrhea alone is already draining, but add a splitting headache on top of that? Instant shutdown mode. Sometimes it feels like no position, no amount of rest, and no cup of tea can make it better.

Here is my way to overcome this struggle
Taking pain relief before cramps fully kick in
Warm compress on my lower belly (sometimes neck too if the headache’s bad)
Drinking lots of water and cutting down coffee a few days before my period
Gentle stretches when I can tolerate it
It helps a little, pero not consistent. Some months okay, some months hell.

1nqag4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeterinaryMedicine/comments/1nqag4c/practice_management_software_pulse/,Practice management software - Pulse,"Hey guys, just wanted to get some opinions from others who use covetrus’ Pulse system for their practice management software. 
We shopped around, set up so many meetings to learn about each program, and ultimately decided to go with Pulse (we previously had impromed). They gave us a timeline and told us they would have people come to train us in person and help us make sure everything gets set up properly after the migration, neither of which happened. Now we are teaching ourselves how to use the software and each week we are continuing to find more issues with the program. The latest being that it doesn’t save our exam forms half the time, even when it pops up telling us it saved.
We asked so many questions before we signed up for their highest tier program and they assured us everything we asked wouldn’t be an issue and made everything sound perfect upfront. Now we can’t get straight answers from anyone and still really don’t know how to even use the program fully. Their customer service just refuse to give straight answers. I flat out asked for a yes or no answer and they just stopped responding… I’m convinced they’re trained to do this intentionally at this point. 
I just found out that we don’t even get a staff discount code to use on their online pharmacy unless we want to discount it through the practice. In my opinion for a company as big as covetrus to not even offer a 10% staff discount code for their pharmacy is just greedy and really shows how little they care for any of us. Our previous online pharmacy My vet store online (Midwest vet supplies) gave us a 15% staff discount code that excluded certain items, and even Chewy will give veterinary professional discount codes if you ask, and we don’t have any affiliation with them. So for us to be spending this much money with them and they can’t even offer something in return is just wild to me. 
Honestly I’m just trying to see if anyone else had experienced anything similar with the Pulse system and Covetrus’ customer support? Our practice is just frustrated we’ve spent so much money and all feel like we made a mistake by making the switch.

1nqafpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1nqafpd/how_to_send_cover_letters_if_you_didnt_network/,How To Send Cover Letters If You Didn't Network Yet For Early Big Law Apps,"**Hiya recruits!**

So I keep getting this question: *“What do I do for a cover letter if I haven’t been able to network with a firm yet? Especially for these early 1L apps that open before I’ve had a chance to talk to anyone?”*

Short answer: **that’s okay! It happens. In fact, it happens more often than not.**

**First things first:**

🔹 **Don’t panic if you don’t have a contact**  
  
You don’t need to name-drop someone you met for coffee to have a valid cover letter. Firms aren’t rejecting people because they didn’t reference an associate. Cover letters are mostly about clarity, professionalism, and showing you put in a bit of effort to know the firm. 

Don't get me wrong, it's always brownie points if you do have a person to name drop, but it's also not the end of the world. 

🔹 **How to handle the “Why this firm” line**  
If you can’t reference a person, swap in a piece of research or an event you attended:

* *Example*: “I was inspired to apply to Simpson after reading their quarterly publication on bankruptcy/reading X thought leadership piece on real estate transactions/whatever.”
* *Example*: “I was drawn to White & Case after attending their panel discussion on recent white-collar defense rulings.”

Notice: you don’t even need to personally talk to someone—attending an event, reading a firm publication, or listening to a podcast counts. The main thing is to show you actually *tried to learn something about them*, not just spraying and praying applications. (Even though, let’s be honest…we all do ands they know we do).

🔹 **Keep it simple**  
Your structure can stay the same:

* Intro (who you are, what you’re applying for)
* Why this office/firm (either networking or research-based)
* What you bring (skills, ties, background, main paragraphs)
* Closing line

One page max. 

(**If you need a template, feel free to DM and I can share mine**). 

🔹 **You can always network later**  
  
Even if you apply “cold,” you can still follow up with networking so that you can a) get someone to push your resume to recruiting and/or b) name drop in an interview. Early applications show initiative—and that’s the real signal firms are looking for right now. Networking can really help clinch those early interviews, especially pre-grades, but you can definitely still submit an excellent application even if you haven't had time to network this early in the semester. 

**Bottom line:** don’t let lack of networking stop you from hitting submit. Show some effort in the “why” section, keep it professional, and move on to the next one.

Okay, minor confession: I have an obsession with odd delivery sims and emotional games, but my wallet and life did not cooperate this month. I’ll happily trade terrible puns, a heartfelt thank-you note, and a promise to pay it forward for a copy of Death Stranding 2. I’m the kind of person who’ll cry during the credits and then recommend the soundtrack for grandma.

To be honest, I want to see all of the beauty that everyone is talking about. Im not in the position to lay down this kinda cash on a newer game. And im worried it wont go much lower during black friday. Im not quite sure what to say about this. I just really want to be able to experience what other people are experiencing but life just isnt easy right now. So ill keep it a tad short. My expectations are low but thank you none the less.

On release my partner played Death Stranding and came back in awe — the world, the music, the weird kindness it teaches. We all know the world and the music that hooks you in those first five minutes. It made the hair on my arm stand up. I ended up adding the entire playlist to my spotify and sometimes I can feel that first moment again when they start to play. And I want to experience this feeling again. I never got to experience the game the way that she did then and now is a good chance. Death Stranding 2 looks like the kind of game that could actually give me a few hours of something bigger than chores: a story I could lose myself in, a place to think, and something to look forward to after bedtime. On top of that I heard there is this awesome red dude with a guitar. And it just makes me wonder what other kind of beautiful and amazing secrets are hidden in this game. So if anyone out there can help me get my hands on this bad boy, i would be forever grateful, I’ll carve out the time — early mornings with coffee, headphones on, not a single delivery slip missed.

Ive helped a couple people on here get some games so maybe someone can return the favor. Anyways, thank you for coming to my ted talk. Even if nothing comes of this, I appreciate the community — people here are the real delivery porters.

Background: I'm a law student in a dual degree program with a STEM major. My mid-level academic goal is to graduate top 20 in law and STEM. High-level goal is to graduate top 10.

Beginning of the week: 

1. Weekly schedule: I use Google Sheets as my main timetable, broken into 1-hour blocks. I loosely map out classes, meetings, and subject-level study (e.g., which subject I’ll focus on).

2. Calendar sync: I then update my iOS Calendar with only fixed events (doctor’s appointments, club meetings, coffee chats, etc.) so I get alarms and don’t miss them.

Beginning of the day:

1. I check my Google Sheet and ios Calendar for what I planned for the day.

2. I update some bigger Daily Agenda in Google Sheet, such as assignments, test prep, admin tasks, etc.

  
Study blocks:

1. Pomodor: I use ios Notes to plan my daily study blocks to task level. I would have the following list filled out:

   1. ***Session 1***
   2. ***Break 1***
   3. ***Session 2***
   4. ***Break 2***
   5. ***Session 3***
   6. ***Break 3***
   7. ***Session 4***
   8. ***Break 4***

Each session is 25min (pomodoro) and break is 5min. I try to strictly stick to them. If I need longer breaks, I add that into my study plan by minute units (ie. sit for 5min). I would aim to do 4x25' sessions followed by a long break. 

2. For breaks, I've started relying on what I call the Break Tool Shed, a list of limited, pre-set activities I can check off during breaks: 

1. **Break Tool Shed (Daily)**
   1. Check Reddit (x3)
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
   2. Check Yahoo Finance (x3)
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
   3. Check EM (x5)
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed
   4. Check Linkedin (x1)
      * Completed
   5. Check News (x3)
      * Completed
      * Completed
      * Completed

The idea is to retrain my brain away from unlimited dopamine hits by capping these activities.

3. Study Set Up: While I study, I have 4 windows open:

i. Google Sheet (for weekly plan)

ii. ios Notes for daily study plan

iii. Focusmate for body doubling (very crucial, as it helps me to treat each session as a professional setting). From this weekend onwards, I'm hoping to pre-book my Focusmate sessions to really lock in my study schedule.

iv. Kairu: I started using this this week. Hoping to get a quick visual on my study analytics.

Stewart, Jr. and [the City of Irondale](https://cityofirondaleal.gov/) did to make it happen and invite you to the grand opening celebration on Saturday, October 11.

# What to expect at the new Irondale library

There’s something about the quiet, order and care where books are housed, and I love how libraries have evolved with the times to become community hubs.

While the previous Irondale branch had served the community since 1973, the new branch offers modern conveniences and special touches like:

* A quiet reading room for adults
* A children’s section with a story time area + interactive play kitchen
* Small study rooms for meetings + remote work
* A used bookstore
* A room devoted to Irondale history, including an original table + typewriter from the previous branch
* Multiple meeting spaces, including a room for adult crafts
* A separate teen area
* A vending machine with “smart choices” + coffee
* A large conference room with attached kitchenette for larger city meetings

>

# How the Irondale community supported the new branch

During our tour, I was able to meet Irondale Public Library’s Director, Del Wilson, who has been an employee for 48 years, as well as Associate Director Tamara Tackett. They both shared their appreciation to Irondale Mayor James D. Stewart, Jr. and Irondale citizens:

We've created r/brewedconfessions \- a cozy corner where Indian/desi folks can share their deepest confessions, untold stories, and real feelings without judgment. Think of it as your chai-time therapy session!

**What we're about:**

* 💕 Love confessions you can't tell your crush
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family drama only brown kids understand
* 😤 Rants about arranged marriage pressure
* 🎓 Student life struggles (JEE/NEET survivors, we see you!)
* 💼 Office confessions and workplace chai-break stories
* 🤫 Secrets you've never told anyone

We know the weight of family expectations, the complexity of our relationships, and why sometimes you need strangers on the internet to remind you that you're not alone.

**Our vibe:** Anonymous if you want, always supportive, never judgmental. We're building a community where your feelings are valid, your struggles are heard, and your victories (big or small) are celebrated.

While trash bags aren't typically an exciting product, these have proven to be surprisingly functional and versatile in my day-to-day life. The description ""fit 2.6-3.2 gallons"" intrigued me initially, as I have a few smaller wastebaskets scattered around the house that always seem to end up with oversized bags awkwardly folded inside. Trust me, finding trash bags that fit the right way is oddly satisfying. 

**Compact Size Meets Functionality**

These garbage bags are perfectly suited for smaller waste bins, which is exactly what I needed. They have a 10-13-liter capacity, and whether I tested them in the guest bathroom, my office corner, or even near the kitchen sink, they delivered. Their breaking-point design makes it effortless to tear one bag off the roll without ending up unraveling half the pack—this alone felt like a win for my clumsy hands. My kids, who often seem to overfill the trash cans in their rooms, also found them easy to use. These things fit like a glove in just about all the small bins at home. 

[Check 3-Gallon 180pcs Small Clear Trash Bags price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b0bqhrx8xz/)

**Pure Material and Kitchen-Appropriate Build**

One standout feature here is the use of pure HDPE (high-density polyethylene) materials. Safe, strong, and odor-free—yes, odor-free. This quality is particularly crucial in bathrooms or when I'm discarding wet waste like coffee grounds or tea bags. Knowing these trash bags are eco-friendly and free from any artificial smell has been reassuring—especially because we’re basically inhaling whatever scent is embedded in our trash bags daily. Even my kitchen gets a break from additional synthetic smells competing with the natural food aromas. 

**Positives**

- Tear-resistant and stretchable material prevents leaks  
- Odorless and eco-friendly construction  
- Ideal for small spaces like offices, bathrooms, and cars  
- Transparent for quick content identification  
- Breaking-point design adds convenience  

**Universal Versatility in Unexpected Ways**

I’ve discovered these bags are good for more than trash. Honestly, they've turned into storage solutions for holiday ornaments, seasonal scarves, even paperback novels that I stash away in closets. Need to bag up some pet litter or those cute but endlessly messy baby diapers? These bags are up for the task. The versatility caught me off guard because I assumed this was a single-use product. From garage organization to kitchen mess, these bags seem more multitasking than some so-called ""all-purpose"" tools.

**Durability Tested and Approved**

Durability is honestly what I’m most picky about because nothing is worse than clearing a ripped trash bag draped in a soggy mess. These hold up surprisingly well for their size. Even when packing up slightly heavier trash like leftover fruits or soda cans, the extra-strong, stretchy material with anti-puncture properties preserved its integrity. I used these in my car during a long-distance trip, and even with soda spills and snack wrappers piling up, they didn’t budge or leak. For bags this small, that’s a major victory.

**Areas for Improvement**

- May not fit unconventional bin shapes  
- Thickness could be increased slightly for heavier, sharp trash  
- Transparent design, though practical, doesn’t camouflage contents for those who prefer opaque bags  

**Competing Products**

If you’re browsing for small garbage bags, you’ve likely run into brands like Glad or Hefty. In my experience, they can be tougher, but they’re often scented or cost more without necessarily providing much extra value. The lightweight build makes these clear trash bags unique yet comparable to pricier, heavy-duty options. However, if you heavily prioritize privacy or need excessively strong bags for sharp objects, you might feel the need to stick with opaque or thicker competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**

Looking at functionality versus expenditure, these bags deliver solid value. Purchasing a roll of 180 counts ensures you're stocked longer than expected, and the multi-purpose usage further stretches their worth over time. Household essentials like these are often used without much thought, but after testing several products, I realized how rare it is to find something affordable, versatile, and reliable all at once.

# Introduction: The New Frontier of Digital Influence in the UAE

The United Arab Emirates stands as a global nexus for digital innovation, where a hyper-connected populace and a forward-thinking business environment have converged to create a uniquely dynamic [social media](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-leading-social-media-marketing-company-in-Dubai) landscape. In this market, a brand's digital presence is no longer a peripheral marketing activity; it is a fundamental pillar of its growth strategy. As the year 2025 unfolds, the rules of engagement are undergoing a profound transformation. 

The simplistic tactics of yesteryear—amassing ""likes"" and follower counts—have been supplanted by a new imperative: generating tangible return on investment (ROI). This shift necessitates a strategic blueprint that goes far beyond a cursory presence, demanding authenticity, technological sophistication, and a deep understanding of evolving consumer behaviors.

This report is designed to serve as that blueprint. It is not merely a directory of social media marketing agencies in the UAE, but a comprehensive, strategic guide for marketing professionals and business leaders aiming to scale their brands effectively. The analysis delves into the capabilities of the region's top digital powerhouses, exploring their specialized services and proven track records. Critically, it also uncovers the most effective, often-overlooked ""hacks"" and unconventional strategies that are shaping brand success in 2025.

 Finally, the report provides a detailed roadmap for navigating the dual worlds of traditional search engine optimization (SEO) and the burgeoning realm of artificial intelligence (AI) search, ensuring that a brand’s digital footprint is not just visible today, but future-proofed for the years to come. The stakes are clear: in this new era, the difference between surviving and scaling hinges on a brand's ability to be not just present, but profoundly strategic and technologically adapt.

# The UAE Social Media Marketing Landscape: A Strategic Overview

# Navigating a Hyper-Connected Market: From Followers to ROI

The digital marketing paradigm in the UAE has fundamentally shifted its focus from superficial metrics to meaningful business outcomes. In the past, success on social media was often measured by ""vanity metrics"" such as the number of followers, likes, and shares. However, this approach has proven insufficient for sustaining long-term business growth. Today, the most successful brands and agencies are those that reorient their social media strategies to prioritize tangible results, including lead generation, customer acquisition, and direct sales. 

This evolution is driven by a maturing market where businesses demand clear, quantifiable returns for their digital marketing investments. An agency like Ninja Promo, for instance, explicitly states its focus on creating strategies that do ""more than just likes,"" aiming instead to boost sales, expand reach, and build lasting relationships with an audience.1 This strategic re-evaluation is essential for any brand seeking to properly scale its operations and achieve predictable growth.

# The Rise of the AI-First Consumer and the “Vibe Culture”

The year 2025 is defined by two seemingly contradictory but deeply intertwined trends: the proliferation of AI-driven personalization and the emergence of ""vibe culture"". The first trend is rooted in the dominance of AI algorithms that curate social media feeds. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have sophisticated AI models that prioritize content based on deep engagement signals, such as video completion rates, replays, and shares, rather than simple follower counts. 

These systems are designed with a singular objective: to keep users scrolling by serving them content that feels highly authentic and personally relevant. This level of hyper-personalization, powered by AI, has given rise to the AI-first consumer—an individual accustomed to a digital world that anticipates their wants and needs.

The second trend, ""vibe culture,"" is a direct consequence of this AI-driven environment.4 In a world of hyper-curated, algorithm-driven feeds, consumers have begun to seek out smaller, more niche communities where they feel genuinely seen and valued. They are gravitating away from the overly polished, inauthentic campaigns that feel manufactured and towards raw, unpolished, and community-driven content. The causal link between these two trends is crucial for any marketing professional to understand. 

The very algorithms designed to predict and personalize user experience have inadvertently created a demand for a counter-movement—a desire for content that feels ""human"" and less ""algorithmic"". A successful 2025 social media strategy must be able to reconcile these forces by leveraging AI for strategic efficiency while simultaneously creating content that resonates with the authentic, mood-driven energy of the ""vibe culture"" to build genuine community.

# The UAE Agency Blueprint: A Deep Dive into the Best Social Media Marketing Services

# The UAEs Top-Tier Digital Powerhouses

The United Arab Emirates is home to a diverse and highly competitive social media marketing industry, featuring a range of agencies that cater to different business needs, from large-scale enterprises to niche brands. A number of full-service digital marketing powerhouses have established themselves as leaders in the market.

Go Digital Alpha, for example, is a prominent digital marketing agency with a strong focus on SEO, online branding, and social media marketing. With over 400 positive client reviews, the agency has demonstrated consistent expertise across various industries, including Manufacturing, Healthcare, and Financial Services. 

Clients frequently praise the team's professionalism, responsiveness, and ability to deliver strategies that lead to significant improvements in website traffic and lead generation. The generally positive sentiment regarding [Go Digital Alpha's](https://godigitalalpha.com/) cost and value for money further positions them as a solid choice for businesses seeking comprehensive support.

Ninja Promo is another top-tier agency that explicitly shifts the focus away from vanity metrics.1 They specialize in creating strategies that are designed to boost sales, expand market reach, and cultivate lasting relationships with an audience. The agency offers a full suite of community management services and has demonstrated expertise across leading social platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. 

Their proven ability to deliver quantifiable results is underscored by case studies, such as their work with Tozex, which saw a 4x subscriber growth and over 150,000 monthly impressions, and Stockmusic, which achieved a 300% increase in engagement.

A key area of caution for any business vetting agencies in the region is the issue of name overlap. A quick search for the agency ""Nexa"" reveals two distinct entities. One is a leading growth and digital marketing agency that boasts a 20-year history and is recognized as a top-tier HubSpot Solutions Partner. This Nexa helps businesses achieve success by creating measurable digital marketing strategies and leveraging transformative technology, content creation, and search engine tactics. Their case studies include work with global brands like Audi, Bosch, and Toshiba, with testimonials from clients like Rove Hotels praising their ability to increase qualified traffic and conversions. 

In stark contrast, another company named Nexa specializes in LED screens and digital signage solutions for businesses across the UAE, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah. This confusion highlights a critical due diligence step for any potential client: an agency's name alone is not a sufficient indicator of its services. A prospective client must dig deeper to understand the specific specializations, expertise, and client base of a particular firm to avoid a potentially costly misstep.

# The Creative and Strategic Innovators

Beyond the full-suite powerhouses, the UAE market also features agencies known for their creative and strategic innovation. These firms often blend digital marketing with cutting-edge technology and unique methodologies.

Digital Gravity is a prime example, positioned as a tech-focused agency that seamlessly blends web and app development with advanced technologies like AI and AR/VR. The agency’s focus on modern tech and regional insight has cemented its position as a high-ranking paid ads agency in Dubai. Their case studies showcase impressive, quantifiable results, such as a 95% rise in organic traffic for a real estate app and a 108% boost in event participation through an event app. The agency has crafted campaigns for major clients like Emaar and Suzuki, demonstrating its capability to deliver significant impact across various sectors, including real estate and hospitality.

Sociallyin is an agency that has earned a strong reputation for its focus on creating tailored social media solutions. The agency consistently receives praise for its flexibility, dedication, and expertise, with more than 90% of its reviews being positive. They specialize in social media management, strategy, and campaigns, and have provided influencer marketing services for a sleep products company, managing a pool of 50-100 influencers to amplify brand reach.

Another notable firm is Moris Media, which operates with a ""Diagnostic Approach"" to social media marketing. They stand out by taking the time to ""diagnose"" a brand's specific challenges and needs, rather than offering a generic, one-size-fits-all solution. Moris Media emphasizes data-driven Instagram strategies built on audience insights to continuously optimize campaigns and maximize ROI. The agency also focuses on building ""authentic communities, not just follower counts,"" by fostering genuine interactions and leveraging micro-influencers to build trust and expand reach.

# The Boutique Experts: Finding Your Niche Partner

For brands with specific, targeted needs, the UAE market offers a number of boutique agencies that specialize in particular areas of digital marketing. These firms often provide a more personalized approach and deep expertise in their chosen niche.

Go Digital Alpha is a leading UAE-based agency that caters to global clients with a focus on digital transformation, strategic consulting, and reputation management. Their status as a Google Partner signals a high level of expertise in foundational digital marketing practices, while their focus on building organic sales funnels helps clients expand their business reach and save on advertising costs.

Hashtag identifies as a “social-first” agency that specializes in “humanizing brands”. Their approach relies on agile content and paid social to deliver culturally relevant, high-engagement campaigns for major entertainment and FMCG brands. This focus on cultural nuance and rapid-response content is crucial for brands operating in the fast-paced, trend-driven social media environment of the UAE.

Finally, the Be Unique Group is a marketing consulting firm that helps brands stand out through expertly planned organic and paid strategies. They focus on helping businesses discover new potential customers, leveraging their strategic expertise to achieve targeted growth.

# Your Agency Vetting Checklist: A Data-Driven Approach

Selecting the right social media marketing partner in the UAE requires a data-driven approach that looks beyond a flashy portfolio. Prospective clients must conduct a thorough due diligence process to ensure they are partnering with a firm that can deliver tangible results.



* Review Volume and Quality: A high number of positive reviews is a strong indicator of consistent performance. For example, WebFX's 437 reviews provide far more confidence than an agency with only four reviews, even if those are all five-star.
* Demonstrated Industry Expertise: The best agencies have a proven track record within a client's specific industry. WebFX, for instance, has demonstrated strong expertise in Manufacturing, Healthcare, and Financial Services, which can be a key differentiator.
* Measurable Case Studies: Look for case studies that provide specific, quantifiable outcomes rather than vague promises. The analysis of Digital Gravity's work with Fajr Interiors (100% increase in brand awareness) and Nexa's work with Rove Hotels (increase in qualified traffic) provides concrete examples of success.
* Cost and Value Alignment: While cost is a factor, the value provided is more important. The positive sentiment towards WebFX's reasonable pricing and comprehensive services suggests that clients feel they receive more than what they pay for.

# The Video-First Imperative: Going Beyond the Screen

Short-form video has established itself as the single most dominant content format on social media platforms, capturing consumer attention, particularly among the 18-to-34 age group. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts have prioritized this format, and a brand's ability to create compelling, action-oriented video content is paramount. To succeed in this video-first landscape, a number of strategic imperatives must be followed. Content should be created with a vertical, 9:16 aspect ratio, as mobile traffic has taken the lead in internet consumption.2 The inclusion of captions and text overlays is also a necessity, as many users consume content without sound.2The most effective video content focuses on authentic storytelling rather than overt sales pitches, as modern consumers are more likely to tune out obvious marketing.2 Interactive tools such as polls, augmented reality filters, and clickable overlays can be used to further increase audience engagement.2 Finally, once a brand has a sufficient follower base, leveraging live streaming is a powerful way to interact with brand loyalists and attract new followers through tutorials or Q&A sessions.2

# The Dumb Hook Strategy: Why Imperfect is the New Polished

In a world saturated with high-production-value video content, one of the most effective and counter-intuitive hacks for 2025 is the ""Dumb Hook"" strategy.13 The core problem with overly polished content is that it often gets scrolled past by an audience trained to identify and ignore advertisements. The solution is to intentionally make the first two seconds of a video feel unfinished and unpolished to capture a user's curiosity.13 This can be achieved by using simple iPhone footage instead of studio shots and adding text overlays that create a ""curiosity gap,"" such as ""Wait til you see this..."".13 This approach makes the content feel more authentic and less like a marketing pitch, compelling the user to stop scrolling and see what happens next.

# Winning with Community: From Followers to Brand Ambassadors

With the rise of niche communities and the audience's growing desire for authenticity, brands must shift their focus from simply growing follower counts to building engaged, loyal communities.2 The most effective social media strategies in 2025 leverage existing audiences to drive exponential growth.

# The $0 Retargeting Trick: Turning Top Commenters into a Sales Force

Instead of spending significant resources on running paid ads to cold audiences, a highly effective, zero-cost hack is to turn a brand’s top commenters into de facto brand ambassadors.13 This ""retargeting"" strategy works by identifying the most engaged users who are already commenting on a brand's posts. The brand then replies to their comments with a call to action such as ""DM me your \[relevant result\]!"".13 Once the user responds, the brand can send them a shareable, ""meme-ified"" version of the original post, effectively turning a highly engaged user into a channel for organic distribution.13 This hack leverages an existing audience to increase organic reach and reduce ad costs, as demonstrated by a beauty brand's case study that saw a 5x increase in organic reach and a 40% reduction in ad costs within 30 days of implementation.13

# The Referral and Micro-Influencer Ecosystem

Tapping into the power of referral and [influencer marketing](https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/influencer-advertising/united-arab-emirates) is another critical component of a community-focused strategy. Instead of chasing expensive, big-name influencers, brands can partner with micro-influencers—those with 1,000 to 10,000 followers.14 These individuals often have a highly engaged and loyal audience and are more affordable, making them a low-cost way to tap into new, niche markets.14 Additionally, implementing a referral program can turn a brand's existing customer base into an organic sales force.14 By offering incentives for customers who refer friends, a brand can create a powerful snowball effect of growth and turn loyal customers into brand ambassadors.14

# The Growth Hacking Toolkit: Scaling with Smart Tactics

Beyond the specific hacks, a number of other growth hacking strategies are essential for scaling a brand in 2025. These tactics are often practical, budget-friendly, and designed to maximize impact with minimal resources.14

# Cross-Promotional Alliances: Collaborating for Exponential Reach

One of the most effective ways to expand a brand's reach without spending a dime is by teaming up with complementary businesses that serve the same target audience but are not direct competitors.14 This is akin to forming a strategic alliance where businesses pool their resources and share their audiences for mutual growth.14 For instance, a local coffee shop could partner with a nearby bookstore for a ""Books and Brews"" event, with both businesses promoting the event to their respective audiences.14 This simple, collaborative approach leverages existing communities to generate new leads and drive brand awareness.

Table 2 provides a concise, at-a-glance reference for these unconventional social media marketing strategies.

Hack/Strategy

Why It Works (The Core Principle)

How to Implement (Step-by-Step)

# ""Dumb Hook"" Strategy

Overly polished content gets ignored. Intentional imperfections create a curiosity gap that feels authentic and human.

Use iPhone footage instead of studio shots. Add a text overlay like ""Wait til you see this..."" in the first 2 seconds.

# $0 Retargeting Trick

Turns highly engaged users into organic distribution channels, reducing reliance on expensive paid ads.

Reply to top commenters with a CTA like ""DM me your \[relevant result\]!"" Send them a shareable, meme-ified version of the post.

# Micro-Influencer Ecosystem

Micro-influencers have highly engaged, niche audiences and are more affordable than macro-influencers.

Identify influencers in your brand's niche (1,000-10,000 followers). Send them a free product in exchange for a shoutout or review.

# Referral Programs

Leverages a brand's existing customers to drive new user acquisition through incentivized word-of-mouth marketing.

Offer a reward (e.g., a discount, free product) to customers who successfully refer a new user to the brand.

# Cross-Promotional Alliances

Expands a brand's reach by tapping into a complementary partner's audience without any advertising spend.

Partner with a business that serves your audience but is not a direct competitor. Co-create content or an event to promote each other's brands.

# The SEO amp; AI Imperative: How to Win in 2025 and Beyond

# From SEO to GEO: The Shift in Search

The fundamental nature of search is changing. In 2025, a brand’s digital presence must be optimized not just for traditional search engines but for a new class of generative AI platforms. The traditional model of SEO was primarily focused on rankings and clicks, where success was measured by a website’s position on a search engine results page (SERP).15 This approach relied heavily on signals like backlinks and keyword density to gain visibility.15

The new discipline, often referred to as Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) or LLM SEO, is centered on a different objective: citations. This strategy aims to make a brand’s content so clear, credible, and trustworthy that AI models are compelled to include it in their own generated answers, even if the user never clicks through to the original site.15 The most successful strategy for 2025 is not to choose between these two approaches, but to adopt a hybrid, ""dual-play"" model. This approach recognizes the increasing convergence between modern Google algorithms and LLM-focused tactics. The goal is to create content that is not only optimized for traditional crawlers but also for the semantic, structured, and authoritative demands of AI. This ensures a brand remains visible in both the traditional blue-link SERPs and the rapidly expanding world of AI-generated answers.

# The E-E-A-T-First Framework: Building a Trust Signal

For both traditional search and AI platforms, the concept of E-E-A-T—Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness—is the cornerstone of a successful content strategy.1AI models, in particular, are designed to prioritize content from sources that demonstrate genuine subject matter knowledge and verifiable credentials.16 They are less concerned with simple keyword stuffing and more interested in the genuine experience behind a brand's claims.16

A powerful way to demonstrate this is by showcasing specific, measurable outcomes from real-world projects. When agencies like Nexa and Digital Gravity present case studies with quantifiable results—such as a 95% rise in organic traffic for a real estate app or a 115% boost in search rankings for a client—they are providing the exact type of evidence that AI models are programmed to reward.7 By including these specific, verifiable claims in this report, the content itself is demonstrating the very expertise and authority that AI platforms prioritize. This creates a self-reinforcing loop of credibility where the report’s recommendations are supported by the very data that validates the firms it references, signaling to both human readers and AI systems that the information is trustworthy and authoritative.

# Citation-Ready Content: The New Standard for Authority

To gain visibility in the new AI-driven search landscape, content must be structured and formatted for machine readability.18 This means creating content that is ""citation-ready,"" allowing AI models to easily extract and quote specific facts and data points.



* Provide Direct Answers: The content should lead with a clear, direct answer to a user's query before expanding on the topic. The first 30-50 words of a section should deliver the core value proposition.18
* Use Concise Language: AI models prefer text that is easy to parse. Sentences should be short, ideally no longer than 15-20 words, to improve the odds that the content will be quoted directly in a generated answer.19
* Cite Reputable Sources: Credibility is paramount. Content should cite reputable industry studies, link to authoritative sources like academic institutions, and include specific data points with verifiable sources to back up all claims.16
* Reference Case Studies: The inclusion of real-world case studies with actual results and demonstrated methodologies provides the type of transparent, outcome-oriented information that AI and human audiences both find valuable and trustworthy.16



# Optimizing for the Algorithm: The AI-Powered Content Strategy

In addition to optimizing for AI search, brands can leverage AI to power their social media strategies. In 2025, AI is no longer just a content creation tool but a strategic partner.4 AI tools can be used to generate content ideas, write captions, and even produce visuals, allowing social media teams to focus on higher-level strategy rather than repetitive tasks.3 Beyond content, AI can be leveraged for sophisticated audience segmentation based on predicted behaviors rather than simple demographics, enabling more personalized and effective targeting.2 Automated bidding strategies powered by AI can continuously optimize ad spend, providing a competitive advantage in a crowded market.2 Furthermore, the implementation of conversational AI can provide 24/7 customer service and community engagement, allowing brands to maintain a constant presence without the need for round-the-clock human oversight.2

# The Technical Backbone: Structured Content for AI Success

For a website's content to be easily parsed and cited by AI models, a strong technical foundation is essential. AI favors content that is well-structured and easy to parse, a practice that also benefits human readability.18



* Logical Heading Hierarchy: The content should follow a clear, logical hierarchy using headings (H1, H2, H3, H4) that accurately describe the content of each section.18 This provides a roadmap for both human readers and AI crawlers to understand the relationship between ideas.
* Scannable Formatting: Dense paragraphs should be broken up with liberal use of spacing, bullet points, and numbered lists.15 This makes the content scannable for both people and machines, boosting its chances of being featured in an AI-generated answer.
* Clean HTML and Markup: Using clean HTML, along with schema markup where applicable, helps AI tools classify and understand the content on a page, improving its eligibility for rich results and enhanced search displays.18

# Final Recommendations: Your Strategic Path Forward

# The Hybrid Approach: Combining Agency Expertise with In-House Execution

For any brand looking to scale effectively in the dynamic UAE market, the most robust and sustainable path forward is a hybrid approach. This strategy involves leveraging the deep expertise of a top-tier social media marketing agency while simultaneously empowering an in-house team to execute on unconventional, real-time growth hacks.

A professional agency provides an indispensable foundation. They offer access to sophisticated AI tools, data-driven insights, and a strategic direction that is constantly refined based on industry trends and market signals. They can build a brand’s authority, manage large-scale paid campaigns, and provide the technical backbone for a people-first, AI-ready website.

Simultaneously, an in-house team remains crucial for nimble, on-the-ground execution. They are the ones who can authentically engage with the ""vibe culture"" and react to micro-trends in real-time. By implementing the unconventional growth hacks—such as the ""Dumb Hook"" and ""$0 Retargeting"" tricks—the in-house team can foster genuine community and drive organic reach in ways that are often beyond the scope of a large, external agency. This symbiotic relationship ensures that a brand benefits from a professional, strategic foundation and the agility of an in-house team, positioning it for long-term growth and resilience.

# Key Takeaways: Your Blueprint for Brand Scaling in the UAE

The journey to scaling a brand in the UAE requires a strategic re-evaluation of what constitutes success in the digital age. The following are the most critical takeaways from this analysis:



1. Prioritize Results Over Vanity Metrics: The most successful brands in 2025 will be those that measure social media success not by likes and follower counts, but by tangible business outcomes such as lead generation and sales.
2. Embrace the Dual-Play SEO Strategy: In an AI-first world, a brand must optimize for both traditional search engine rankings and citation potential within generative AI platforms. The most successful approach combines the principles of traditional SEO with the new demands of GEO.
3. Leverage the Power of Authenticity: In a market dominated by AI-driven personalization, the antidote to ad fatigue is authenticity. Brands must embrace unconventional hacks like the ""Dumb Hook"" strategy to create content that feels human and resonates with the emerging ""vibe culture.""
4. Turn Your Audience into Ambassadors: The most effective growth hacks are those that leverage a brand’s existing community. Strategies like the ""$0 Retargeting Trick"" and the use of referral programs and micro-influencers can drive exponential growth at minimal cost.
5. Treat Your Social Presence as a Trust Signal: A brand’s social media presence is not a standalone marketing channel; it is a core component of its overall authority. Every piece of content, every engagement, and every positive review contributes to the E-E-A-T that is essential for both human and AI trust.
6. Use AI as a Strategic Partner: AI should be used not just for content creation, but for higher-level strategic activities such as audience segmentation, personalized targeting, and automated community management, freeing up human teams to focus on core creative and strategic tasks.

But what I wonder is - has anyone found the workflow itself very frustrating?

Normally I only used LLMs as Google++, mostly for the topics that I'm already familiar with, as quick reminder, or some generic code samples.

But at some point I decided to become less of a dinosaur, and for the past several months I've been trying to actively use LLMs, like Claude CLI or Cursor, and I think I'm not ready for this brave new world of LLM coding yet.

I see people saying stuff like ""I barely touch code, if I need to intervene it means something is wrong with my prompting"".

I don't know how to do that without pulling my hair out - if I'm not specific enough with instructions, it will inevitably do some dumb shit, like making 1 line of perfectly working code into 30 that are broken, or littering the code with pointless fallbacks on invariants.

If I'm \*too\* specific, I have to spend more time instructing it than I'd do actually writing the thing myself. And I couldn't find any ""balanced"" point of specificity, because unless I get to the ""too specific"" stage, it is still unpredictable.

But even that is not the core of the issue - I think the core of the issue, and what takes the most mental toll on me, is that the entire thing feels like a weird rollercoaster. One moment it magically oneshots something reasonably involved, and another, when you start to believe that it is somewhat capable, it does the dumbest shit imaginable on something that's utterly trivial.

I saw advice to go iteratively in small chunks, and it's pretty much the same, just in smaller doses - high and low, high and low, as if chugging 5 cups of coffee and then crashing.

I don't know if it makes me more efficient or not, but it certainly makes me more frustrated in general.",11,1758814494.0,ExperiencedDevs,10,0.92,False

I have a very large property I can plant them on I’m just curious what I should be looking for in terms of area soil composition and timing when planting them in the spring. I’m an arborist by trade but my planting skills are quite poor so any feedback is appreciated greatly. I am located in Eastern Ontario Canada if this changes anything. There is a considerable amount of grey loamy soil, sandy loam and organic lowland soils with poor drainage.

Discover smarter apps that combine AI personalization, podcasts, and immersive formats—led by BeFreed.*

## Introduction

If you’ve used **Microbook**, you already know its value: fast text-based book digests for busy readers. But here’s the challenge—short snippets alone don’t guarantee **deep learning or retention**. In 2025, learners want more than bite-sized reading. They want **adaptive, multi-format tools** that fit their goals and lifestyles.

That’s where this guide comes in. We’ll cover the **best Microbook alternatives in 2025**, starting with **[BeFreed](https://befreed.ai)**, a San Francisco–based AI-powered learning app that transforms books, expert talks, and research into **personalized podcasts, videos, and smart roadmaps.**

## What Is Microbook?

**Microbook** is a book summary app that condenses nonfiction titles into quick, text-based micro-summaries. It’s designed for speed and convenience, offering learners an efficient way to grasp key points without committing to full books. While helpful for quick insights, it lacks **personalization, audio/visual formats, and adaptive learning pathways** that many users now expect in 2025.

## Top Microbook Alternatives in 2025

Here are the leading apps that go beyond Microbook’s **text-only format** to deliver **personalized, engaging, and effective smart learning experiences.**

### 1. BeFreed – Personalized AI Learning That Feels Natural

BeFreed is at the top of this list because it doesn’t just summarize—it **reimagines how learning happens**. Built by AI researchers from Columbia University, Google, and Pinterest, and based in **San Francisco**, BeFreed combines books, podcasts, and expert research into **personalized podcasts, immersive videos, and smart flashcards.**

**Key Features:**
* **AI-personalized podcasts**: Choose 10, 20, or 40 minutes depending on your focus.
* **Customizable hosts**: Select voice, tone, and personality for your learning experience.
* **Immersive video lessons**: Especially powerful for history, biographies, and science.
* **Smart learning roadmap**: Adapts based on your goals, struggles, and listening habits.
* **Global library**: 100,000+ bestselling, trending, and classic nonfiction titles.

**Why It Stands Out:** Unlike Microbook’s static text summaries, BeFreed creates **dynamic, layered learning experiences**. For example, one episode might merge *Atomic Habits* with a Stanford psychology lecture and a behavioral science podcast—delivering insights that no single summary could match.

BeFreed also caters to **busy professionals, students, and neurodivergent learners**. It turns commutes, workouts, or coffee breaks into **dopamine-friendly learning rituals** that actually stick.

**Pricing:**
* Free tier with one summary included
* Premium: $12.99/month, $28.99/quarter, $89.99/year
* Includes a 3-day trial
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 2. Mentorist – Learn by Doing

Instead of focusing on summaries, **Mentorist** turns books into **action plans** that help you apply lessons immediately.

**Key Features:**
* Step-by-step tasks based on book insights
* Progress tracking and habit-building tools
* Focus on leadership, productivity, and personal development
* Integration with daily journaling and reminders

**Why It Stands Out:** Where Microbook stops at reading, Mentorist helps you **practice and implement ideas.** It’s a strong choice for learners who want to bridge the gap between theory and action.

**Pricing:** $8.99/month or $89.99/year  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android

### 3. Uptime – 5-Minute Knowledge Hacks

**Uptime** delivers short, **visual knowledge cards** from books, documentaries, and courses, designed for scroll-friendly consumption.

**Key Features:**
* 5-minute “Knowledge Hacks”
* Visual storytelling with infographics
* Coverage of books, courses, and documentaries
* Great for curiosity-driven learners

**Why It Stands Out:** Compared to Microbook, Uptime expands beyond books into multimedia sources. It’s ideal for quick bursts of inspiration, though it lacks BeFreed’s personalization and depth.

**Pricing:** Free tier + $8.99/month premium  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 4. Knowable – Audio-First Learning

**Knowable** is designed for people who prefer **podcasts and long-form audio** to reading.

**Key Features:**
* Audio-first courses taught by experts
* Lessons ranging 30–60 minutes
* Professional development + personal growth topics
* Q&A and community features

**Why It Stands Out:** Unlike Microbook’s text-heavy summaries, Knowable delivers **expert-led audio courses**. While not personalized like BeFreed, it’s great for deep, structured listening.

**Pricing:** $12.99/month or $89.99/year  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 5. Imprint – Visual Knowledge Made Simple

**Imprint** transforms big ideas into **visual swipeable stories**, ideal for learners who think in pictures.

**Key Features:**
* Illustrated book and idea summaries
* Visual-first format with swipeable cards
* Focus on psychology, business, and personal growth
* Engaging infographics for quick recall

**Why It Stands Out:** Imprint offers a **visual dimension** missing from Microbook. However, it doesn’t yet provide **adaptive AI personalization** like BeFreed.

**Pricing:** $12.99/month or $89.99/year  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android

## Why BeFreed Is the Best Smart Learning App

While Microbook and similar apps emphasize speed, **BeFreed** focuses on **personalized mastery**. It’s not about rushing through content—it’s about building learning experiences that **adapt to you, feel engaging, and last long-term.**

### Smarter Than a Book Summary App

Unlike static text-only summaries, BeFreed blends:

* **Books, expert talks, podcasts, and research papers** into a single personalized feed
* **AI-personalized podcasts** that you can set for 10, 20, or 40 minutes
* **Flashcards and summaries** for reinforcement
* **Immersive video content** for subjects like history and science

This multi-format design ensures you’re not just skimming—you’re **connecting deeply with ideas.**

### Built for How You Actually Learn

BeFreed adapts dynamically to:

* **Learning styles** – audio, visual, or mixed
* **Energy levels** – lighter insights when tired, deeper dives when focused
* **Personal goals** – whether you’re building confidence, scaling your career, or mastering psychology

Think of BeFreed as a **personal coach and podcast host in one**, evolving with you week after week.

* **Smart learning roadmap** evolves as the AI learns from your listening and reading habits

Learners in **San Francisco, New York, London, and Singapore** are already adopting BeFreed as their daily learning partner—because it **fits seamlessly into busy lifestyles.**

## How to Choose the Right Learning App for You

When deciding between Microbook and its alternatives, consider:

1. **Format Preference**
   * Text-only → Microbook
   * Audio-first → BeFreed, Knowable
   * Visual-first → Imprint
2. **Depth vs. Speed**
   * Quick surface-level → Microbook, Uptime
   * Adaptive, personalized → BeFreed
3. **Application Focus**
   * Action-taking → Mentorist
   * Professional & lifestyle skills → BeFreed, Knowable
   * Curiosity snacks → Uptime

For most learners balancing **time and retention**, **BeFreed is the most versatile and rewarding choice.**

## Final Thoughts & Summary

Microbook introduced many readers to fast summaries, but 2025 requires more: **AI-driven personalization, immersive learning, and adaptive growth.**

Here are the top 3 picks for smarter learning:

1. **BeFreed** – Best for adaptive, personalized smart learning
2. **Mentorist** – Best for applying book lessons into daily life
3. **Knowable** – Best for structured, expert-led audio learning

I just started reading the book, still in the intro.

The claim is that bulletproof diet will increase the weight loss back to 3 or 4 lbs per week. ( I still have 60+ lbs to lose; male, 6'1, now 260.5 lbs. started at 288.4)

Has anyone tried this and what were your results?

I stopped drinking coffee after week 2 since I didn't like it without sweetner, and heavy whipping cream had additives that weren't on carnivore.  I understand MCT oil and coffee isn't really carnivore either but I'm not a pureist.  I thought I'd try it with another sweetner rather than Splenda.

Carnivore diet to me is a lot more than just weight loss,  I've seen great health benefits in the last 5 weeks including lessening hand tremors, improvement in Carpal Tunnel, Joint health and greatly improved eyesight.

Château Pichon Longueville «Comtesse de Lalande» 2006:

Resisting time, in the glass it showed a lovely deep ruby color with hints of garnet at the rim. Still nicely  saturated  with a slight softening around the edges showing its age. 
Wonderful complex and layered nose. The initial aromas to stand out where cassis and ripe plums. As it slowly opened notes of violet and red berries emerged followed by tobacco, cedar, smoke and a touch of coffee that reminded me of an espresso. Subtle hints of menthol, liquorice and graphite in the background.
Silky in texture but with a muscular back this wine is full bodied and rich with an elegant class. Firm, fine-grained tannins give structure to this wine as the acidity helps to energize the wine and balance it.
The bouquet’s fragrances gracefully return on the palate, weaving harmony between nose and taste confirming the greatness of this wine!

Tried a taster pack of Exhale's fine pre-ground medium roast. Liked it a lot. Didn't have any trouble brewing. 

Ordered some decaf and it's so slow to brew in comparison. It's lukewarm by the time the mug is full. 

I'm using a ceramic v60 with unbleached Zhiye filters.

Couple of (measured) tablespoons of coffee with about 300ml of water (measured with a jug once, now just eyeball it in the mug).

I was barely eating lunch, needing something to help me sleep every night. I was getting so irritable during that “crash” later in the day from barely eating. messed with my exercise and energy levels which made me more irritable because exercising is a part of my routine I really value. 

so I started 10mg ir this week. yesterday I took it,  didn’t have coffee, and it worked pretty well for like half my work day. today I am working from home and I had coffee this morning, then realized, oh shit, now I have to wait to take it. I think I took it too close to when I had coffee so now i’ve been sitting here on my phone for an hour, taking laps around the house, doodling… completely unfocused. getting anxious i’m unfocused. trying to come up with a plan for the day. ah yes. the way I felt before being medicated for my adhd. 

anyone taking IR? who also likes to have some caffeine in the morning? what’s your morning routine? i’d love to take one IR for the middle portion of my work day (late morning-early afternoon) and maybe avoid two IR. but I still really need to play around with it all.  any advice helps.

5.9/10

Danny Trejo is a Mexican-American actor and film producer with over 400 acting credits and a career spanning nearly 40 years. He's known for his roles as tough criminals and villains in films like Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, Con Air, and the Machete franchise. He has also featured on several YouTube shows that I enjoy, flexing his culinary knowledge and likable persona. Alongside his hot sauces, he also sells honey, coffee, tortilla warmers, cookbooks, and a lot of other merch. With that, let’s get into the review!

REVIEW: Right away, I could tell this sauce was on the milder side of typical habanero sauces. I don’t typically describe a sauce as “watery”, but this one fits that description, unfortunately, and is quite thin. The flavor of the ingredients are pretty nice, though- featuring carrot and apple juice as sweeter balancing factors. And although allspice is the least used ingredient, the small hint of it encourages thought of Mexican dishes. For the price point, I don’t know if I’d consider trying any other selections of the Trejo sauce any times soon. Not bad, but doesn’t necessarily stick out either. Rest in Peace, Spicy Prince

I was looking for a good bag because my current purse can hold one diaper if I’m lucky, and I just needed more. I’m going on a roadtrip which is going to take about 3 days.

I found this, and honestly it’s a win! I got a color that’s not terribly flashy because I don’t want it to bring attention to me. In the first zippered pocket, I can hold 2 of my Tena Overnights (they soak up more and I need that for a road trip), or for work, I can put 3 of my lighter diapers in there.

During the road trip, I will have my diapers in a gallon ziploc bag within my purse to keep them safe from humidity or anything else). In the flap pocket I can hold my travel size wipes, and hand wipes. And in the interior, I have my tablet (purple) and cream incase the excessive sitting and moisture starts to irritate my skin.

Been monitoring my cholesterol with labs every six months for two years. So I have data from before I started HRT, and when my dose was raised twice (now on max dose transdermal estradiol). No progesterone being taken due to Mirena.

Here's my concern: My doc has been pushing ""lifestyle changes"" because of my cholesterol labs, otherwise threatning to prescribe me statins. I've been sedentary a few years but am only mildly overweight, I don't get BMI lectures or anything yet. Well, after raising my E dose, I suddenly felt like exercising! And I changed my diet! I've cut out a lot of junk foods and moderated my dairy a lot, and been eating a LOT of salmon and other seafoods and chicken because I don't eat red meat, and Amy's vegetarian frozen meals the rest of the time. Plus, I started rebounding on a mini trampoline and I've lost 10lbs in 2 months and gained a ton of strength and energy I didn't have before exercising! I'm at almost 5x a week at this point. This has been going on for the last couple of months, so i REALLY expected my cholesterol lab results to improve. ALSO i quit nicotine last month!!! I HAVE DONE SO MANY GOOD THINGS FOR MY BODY since the previous lab, finally, so what gives??? I was proud of myself!!!

Instead, everything is still in the red at levels my doctor is going to tell me to ""eat healthier and exercise"" about but i HAVE BEEN so.... 

What else on earth could be spiking my cholesterol? I heard it could be the way i filter my coffee but i'm a little embarassed to ask my doctor something like that. ",7,1758813857.0,Menopause,7,1.0,False

*Natasha Pirard returns with her most personal project yet, dedicated to her mother and late grandmother, whose care shaped her life. Fernande, Cecile is a photobook of songs, weaving voice, field recordings, synthesizer, and violin into an ode to her matrilineal line. Pirard lost her grandmother at seven, yet Fernande’s warmth stayed with her as a touchstone. Her mother, Cecile, has been a constant presence, guiding her through difficult years.*



*Alzheimer’s—her grandmother’s illness—and the fragility of memory permeate the work. A conversation with her mother sparked the album: over coffee, Cecile placed a hand on her heart and said, “If I ever develop this disease, don’t forget I’m still here (inside).” That moment became central to the compositions, which translate Pirard’s gratitude and love into music as tender as possible.*



*The music moves in fragments—notes, chords, loops—evoking gardens, sunlight, and childhood afternoons. Rhythms shift like life itself, carrying echoes of loss and the persistence of memory. Ambient textures brush against her voice and instruments, sometimes punctuated by her grandmother’s favorite bird.*



*The album unfolds in two parts: Fernande, capturing her grandmother’s warmth and fading recollections, and Cecile, honoring her mother’s care and resilience. Track titles trace memories while the music drifts through longing and gratitude, articulating what words cannot.*

Its texture strikes a perfect balance—neither too firm nor overly soft—which ensures that the tip glides effortlessly along the lips. This feature is a lifesaver on busy mornings when precision needs to meet speed. The color payoff was instantly noticeable, and I appreciated how sharp the tip remained during multiple uses, reducing the frequency of sharpening.

**Performance and Longevity**  
One of the main claims about this product is its long-wearing formula. I decided to put that to the test during various scenarios—workdays filled with coffee breaks, casual hangouts, and a formal event where touch-ups weren’t an option. The results? Impressive. The lip liner stayed put for hours, acting as an excellent base for my lipstick. Even without an additional layer of product, the color on its own remained vibrant and resisted feathering. There were moments during meals when the pigmentation faded slightly, but it did so evenly, never leaving awkward lines or patchy edges.

**Shade Variety to Compliment Every Look**  
Few brands can boast a shade range as versatile as this one. Whether you're after a dramatic espresso tone, a playful mauve, or a natural nude, there's a shade for every occasion. I used the classic brown shade for contouring my lips, and it seamlessly blended with my favorite lipstick. On another day, the product doubled up as a standalone lip color. Just a bit of balm on top, and I had a soft matte look that didn’t require additional effort. This range promises inclusivity, catering to different skin tones and personal preferences.

**Ease of Pairing with Other Products**  
The versatility of this lip liner means it can be paired with a multitude of beauty products. When matched with a gloss from the same brand for minimalistic day makeup, the finish was polished and cohesive. On another occasion, I tested it with a matte lipstick from a competitor brand; the liner acted as a solid foundation, enhancing the lipstick’s wear time. As someone who swears by cruelty-free cosmetics, I was pleased knowing this pencil holds up NYX's commitment to ethical beauty practices.

**Strengths**  
- Wide variety of shades to suit multiple skin tones and occasions  
- Creamy texture allows for effortless application without tugging on the lips  
- Long-lasting formula that resists bleeding and fading  
- Compact and travel-friendly design  
- Blendable with other lip products while maintaining its color integrity  

**Pitfalls**  
- Reapplication needed after consuming oily foods  
- Those with super-dry lips may want to layer with lip balm beforehand for smoother results  
- The pencil lacks a built-in sharpener, which could be a slight inconvenience on the go  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this lip liner with other brands like the MAC Lip Pencil and Urban Decay's 24/7 Glide-On Lip Pencil, the differences become clear. MAC's formula offers exceptional richness in pigment but feels slightly drier and more challenging to blend. On the other hand, Urban Decay’s option has similar smoothness but comes at a steeper price point. Neither competitor had the same extensive range of shades as the NYX model, especially in their more affordable selections. For budget-conscious users looking for a balance of quality and choice, this slim pencil holds its ground exceptionally well.

**Quality for Price**  
Balancing affordability with performance is no easy feat, yet this product delivers. Its price-to-quality ratio makes it accessible without compromising on results. High-end alternatives may excel in certain areas, but the difference isn’t substantial enough to justify the price hike for most casual users. If you're someone who needs a reliable lip liner without venturing into luxury territory, this is a smart pick. Its affordability and performance make it a worthy addition to any makeup routine.

1nq9lfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq9lfj/im_starting_to_resent_my_husband/,I'm starting to resent my husband,"Anon account since my husband follows my main.

I (30F) have been with my husband (30M) for over 7 years now. 2 years ago, my husband got laid off from his job, so we got married so he wouldn't have to be without health insurance (COBRA premiums were way too expensive and he has chronic anxiety that he needs to take meds for).

The whole time I've known him, he's always been a bit lazy, but it was always in ways I thought he would outgrow if he needed to. For example, he never really cleans around the house unless I specifically give him a task or the house gets so filthy it triggers his anxiety. This has always bothered me, specifically because he'll complain about how dirty it is, but not doing anything about it.

A few months after he got laid off, he got a new job that requires him to go to the office M-F. The problem is he's been waking up late and getting to work late. His new job requires employees to tell them what hours they plan on being in the office (weird, I know, but a policy is a policy, and he's allowed to pick whatever 9-hour period of time he wants as long as the building is open) and he was informed by his manager at their one-on-one that his actual clock-in times have been super sporadic and that HR might get involved.

He's always had a hard time waking up in the morning, so I started packing his lunch the night before and setting the coffee maker to make sure he has coffee ready for him when he's supposed to wake up. I also talked to him about going to bed earlier, not doom scrolling before bed, putting his phone across the room at night so when the alarm goes off, he has to physically get up to turn it off, etc. Apparently, none of that has worked.

I recently found out that he will get out of bed (after I force him to turn off his alarm), let the dog out to potty, then fall asleep on the couch. I'm currently on disability right now due to a recently-diagnosed health issue, and I have been getting up around 10am since I'm not working and my illness makes me very fatigued. I've been shocked to find him still sleeping on the couch when I get up. My husband's reported hours are supposed to be 7am-4pm (he picked those times bc he doesn't want to work late and said traffic is bad if he goes later).

He tells me it's because he doesn't like his job and he doesn't like getting up in the mornings, but I feel super taken advantage of and I feel sooo mad. I feel like crap all day and would love to sleep 24/7, but I still get up, clean/vacuum the house, make sure all his meals are made, make his coffee (which I don't drink), and do my best to make his life comfortable, and he can't even get to work on time. If he loses his job again, I don't know what I'll do. My job has already basically said there's going to be layoffs soon because the economy isn't doing well, and my disability benefit won't last forever. 

I feel like the only adult in my relationship and I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do at this point. It feels so stupid to be this upset by someone not getting up early, but I really feel so hopeless and lonely.",4,1758813558.0,offmychest,3,0.83,False

Hastily built after the 1906 earthquake, you’ll find turn-of-the-century architecture and Misson-style homes, not to mention lofty views with fog seasonally crawling up the street thick as a blanket. Its highlight is Glen Canyon Park, a rambling, wild green space of 66 acres, with a deep canyon, spring wildflowers, one of the city’s last free-flowing creeks and wildlife including coyotes and deer. Close to areas with more name recognition like Noe Valley and Bernal Heights, Glen Park has its own village-like identity; it’s largely residential, with a tight-knit community and some great shopping and dining. Quietly cool, Glen Park might not be as in-your-face as other San Francisco neighbourhoods, but that’s what gives the place its charm.

I’ve gone through my share of all-purpose cleaning products, usually scrubbing until my arms ache, especially when it comes to those stubborn coffee stains in my tumbler. So, when I found out I could just toss one of these tablets into a bottle, add water, and basically let it do all the hard work, I was skeptical. However, after using them daily for a couple of weeks, I can confidently say they’ve changed the way I approach cleaning reusable bottles, thermoses, and other drinkware.

**Performance and Effectiveness**

I was genuinely impressed by how quickly these tablets went to work. Once dropped into warm water, they dissolve almost instantly, creating a bubbly cleaning solution that seems to reach every crevice of the bottle. I tested them on a variety of surfaces, including a grimy stainless steel water bottle and my glass coffee tumbler that hadn’t seen a proper deep clean in weeks. Both came out looking spotless—no scrubbing required! Even the lingering tea odor that other cleaners failed to tackle was completely gone. They’re like magic in a little tablet. 

[Check USKICH 0012 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b0dk1d5l4h/)

**Ease of Use**

The simplicity of these tablets cannot be overstated. You drop one into your container, pour in some warm water, and wait about 15–30 minutes before rinsing. That’s it. There’s no need for bottle brushes or awkward scrubbing to reach those narrow bottoms or tight corners. For someone like me, who’s always on the go, this effortless routine was a game-changer. Cleaning my hydration pack after hiking was usually a dreaded task, but not anymore. And the fact that I can take these with me while camping? Pure genius. They’re lightweight and easy to pack, so I can clean my containers right in the middle of the woods without a sink in sight.

**Highlights**

• Safe and eco-friendly composition, perfect for someone conscious about reducing harsh chemicals in their home.  
• Fast-acting formula that works on stainless steel bottles, coffee tumblers, and even baby bottles.  
• Effectively tackles stubborn coffee, tea, and wine stains.  
• Eliminates odors, leaving everything smelling fresh and ready for your next drink.  
• Compact and travel-friendly packaging, ideal for outdoor enthusiasts.  

**Shortcomings**

Let’s face it, no product is perfect, and these tablets are no exception. While I’ve loved their convenience and cleaning power, there are a couple of nitpicks.  

• They don’t come with any included measuring tool for water, which might leave some people guessing if they’re using the “right” amount.  
• I needed multiple tablets for really large containers, like my one-liter water bottle, which could make the pack run out faster for heavy users.  
• They’re not exactly a one-size-fits-all solution—plastic with heavy discoloration didn’t fully restore to its original color, although it got much better.  

**Target Audience**

These tablets are perfect for anyone who uses reusable drinkware regularly. If you’re juggling multiple water bottles, coffee mugs, or tumblers in your household, you’ll appreciate not having to scrub each one by hand. Busy parents, commuters, and outdoor enthusiasts will especially benefit from how portable and simple they are to use. They’re also great for anyone who wants to reduce their environmental impact by cutting out chemical-heavy cleaners.

**Competing Products**

I’ve tried similar bottle cleaning tablets before, namely from some well-known brands marketed for outdoor gear. While those worked, I often found the smell they left behind a bit questionable—or they simply didn’t do a thorough job with tough stains. USKICH's product stands out with its odor elimination and ability to tackle even the stubborn marks left behind by wine or tea. However, compared to some eco-friendly alternatives, I think these might be slightly less biodegradable, though that’s not fully clear. There are definitely pricier options out there that claim to do more, but honestly, I didn’t notice any major advantage they had over USKICH’s offering.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Considering you get 48 tablets in a pack, I’d say you’re absolutely getting value for money here. Sure, you might need to use more for particularly grimy containers, but for the vast majority of everyday use, one per bottle does the job perfectly. I feel like this pack could last me several months, even with frequent use. For anyone who regularly spends time deep-cleaning drinkware, the time and effort saved alone make this purchase worth it. Add in the portability and eco-friendliness of the formula, and it’s easy to see why they’re such a good bang for your buck.

They made a raspberry pineapple smoothie that still absolutely haunts my dreams. It was fantastic. I’ve never had another smoothie come close.

It was not a standard menu offering, but they had a build-your-own smoothie option to choose two fruits, and it just so happened that those two fruits came together in a magical way. I’ve tried different recipes over the years, but for some reason, nothing else hits the same. 

I’ve convinced myself it must have something to do with the yogurt base. My husband actually worked at Global Grounds for a short time, so I’ve begged him for the secret, but he can’t remember the recipes. He says the yogurt base came in a white carton with no branding (to his memory), just labeled “yogurt smoothie base,” or something to that effect. I know that it was Sodexo-owned, if that helps.

How difficult was it for you to quit entertainment content and did you manage to stick to it?","In blogs and YouTube videos about internet addiction and going off gadgets, they mostly give the same advice: “Set limits on your phone” “Start exercising” “Don’t take your phone into the bedroom”. People say that only the first few days were hard, and then suddenly the world looked brighter, they had more energy, and they no longer wanted to spend time online.

In my case, over three months I only managed to cut my screen time from 10 hours to 4. And I didn’t last a single day on a full digital detox.

I’m 32, I work from home, and I’ve been struggling with depression in recent years. Usually, after waking up, I’d lie in bed for about 30 minutes reading the news and scrolling TikTok. Then I’d move to the couch and spend another 1–1.5 hours drinking coffee, having breakfast, and listening to podcasts. I’d sit down at my computer to work, constantly getting distracted by messages. In the evening I’d put on a show or an audiobook in the background while doing routine chores—cooking, cleaning, going grocery shopping. As a result, if subtract sleep, the only time I was without background noise was in the shower.

In early July I was going to declutter my clothes and couldn’t decide which TV show or audiobook to put on in the background. So I decided to try not turning anything on.. I spent three hours sorting and ironing clothes in complete silence. It felt like my brain was going to burst. Time passed so slowly. But afterwards I felt so rested, like I’d spent a weekend in nature. That experience inspired me to try digital minimalism. Since then I haven’t watched a single show, I’ve limited YouTube and Instagram to just 10 minutes a day, and I’ve only been reading paper books.

But after a couple of weeks I slid back into a hole again. Social media got replaced by doomscrolling news on Telegram and scrolling through online store items. I’m still dependent on gadgets, though not as badly as before.

As we age, natural collagen production decreases, often leading to visible signs of aging such as fine lines, wrinkles, brittle nails, thinning hair, and stiffness in the joints. This is where Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides comes in, offering a convenient and effective way to replenish collagen levels and promote overall health and beauty from within.

[Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides](https://www.medxpharmacy.com/product/vital-proteins-unflavoured-collagen-peptides-powder-567g-for-healthy-hair-skin-nails/) is made from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine collagen and contains no artificial additives. Each serving delivers 20 grams of hydrolyzed collagen peptides, which are broken down into smaller molecules that are easy for the body to absorb. Because it is unflavored, the powder blends seamlessly into hot or cold drinks, including coffee, tea, smoothies, and soups, without altering the taste or texture. This makes it simple to incorporate into your daily routine.

The benefits of consistent collagen supplementation extend far beyond appearance. For skin, it helps improve hydration, elasticity, and firmness while reducing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. For hair, the amino acids in collagen support keratin production, leading to stronger, shinier, and thicker strands. For nails, collagen helps reduce brittleness, prevents splitting, and promotes faster, healthier growth. Beyond beauty, collagen peptides also support joint comfort, bone strength, and recovery after physical activity, making it a true all-around wellness supplement.

Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides is now available at [MedXPharmacy](https://www.medxpharmacy.com/), making it easier than ever to add high-quality collagen to your lifestyle. With regular use, many users report noticeable results in as little as 8 to 12 weeks. Whether your goal is glowing skin, stronger hair and nails, or better joint health, this supplement is a reliable way to give your body the support it needs every day.",1,1758812599.0,Gymhelp,0,1.0,False

———-

Me F(45) and my husband M(51) have worked toward opening up for a few years now. He is ready to date, asked a few people and not gotten a yes yet but hopefully soon. I’m free to date ofc just not interested right now. 

We’ve been meaning to set up a dating budget for months now and thinking thru it myself I’m kind of like… WHO IS EVEN GOING TO DATE OUR BROKE ASSES?? 

We are middle income, three kids. Our budget is pretty strict so that we still can save for stuff and are staying out of debt. Like, we eat out twice a month as a family, take turns with who gets to use the new clothes money each month, hubby and I usually do free stuff for date night…

Whoever dates either one of us will have to be OK with lots of coffee and walks. Geocaching and free crafts at the library I guess 🙃

Here’s my real puzzler: we don’t want dates over while our kids are home. **Where are the overnights happening?** At home but in the middle of the day? (Um except for the summer when the kids are all home??) While I take the kids to grandmas? Hotels could be a special occasion option but not often. 

Some people might be able to host. Maybe it will just be one more thing people can take or leave about dating one of us. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Ok. Thinking that though was helpful, I have plenty of question for the two of us to consider. 

What do you all think? For other broke parents of young kids, how are you making this work in your life?

**Parsing the Odds: The Mariners Are Baseball’s Version of a Coffee Addict—They Just Don’t Stop**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a player crunching a double-digit strikeout game. The Mariners (89-69) are favored at -115 to -120 on the moneyline across books, implying a **55-57% chance to win**. The Rockies (+260 to +280) are the definition of a “long shot,” suggesting bookmakers give them a **26-33% chance**. For context, the Mariners have won **65% of their games** this season, while the Rockies are a historic trainwreck at **26.8%**. Colorado’s 5.99 ERA is so bad, even their opponents are applying for refunds. Seattle’s 3.88 ERA? That’s elite company, ranking 11th in MLB. The Rockies’ 1.586 WHIP (walks + hits per inning) is like a leaky faucet—constantly dripping disaster. Seattle’s 1.225 WHIP? A tidy, efficient number that makes Colorado’s look like a math student’s first attempt at calculus.

**Digesting the News: The Rockies Are Baseball’s Version of a Participation Trophy**  
The Mariners just steamrolled the Rockies **9-2** in their last meeting, with Cal Raleigh hitting his **60th home run** of the season—tying the MLB record for most in a season. That’s not a typo. Sixty. Meanwhile, Rockies starter Bradley Blalock (2-5, 9.16 ERA) is about as reliable as a chair made of Jell-O. His ERA is so high, even the Rockies’ mascot probably whispers prayers before he toes the rubber.

Seattle’s offense? It’s a home-run factory. They’re slugging **1.5 bombs per game**, with Raleigh (60 HRs, 125 RBI) and Julio Rodríguez (.324 OBP, 173 hits) leading the charge. The Rockies, meanwhile, hit 156 HRs total—\*\*24th in MLB

Im 33 year old female working at a huge energy conglomerate as a Sr. Engineer

I left federal.....cuz you know it sucks working there rn.

Anyway I started a couple months back and was contacted by another female who worked in a different dept.

I could only.explain what she did was some sort of ""friend bombing"" such as messaging me and being really friendly.

I was surprised and thought she was being welcoming.

We would meet for coffee and do what I would assume as giving each other advice.

I told her how I was able to meet with senior management and some directors and gave her pointers on how to make the introductions. I thought I was helping.

Instead she told me later on that day that she was taken aback about how ""way more behind me she was"" in trying to network?? Like wtf?? Thats why im trying to help. There were multiple examples of this is just wanted to give you guys the overall vibe

Anyway there were other odd things about her...such as her constantly cat calling the men and meeting eith her ""mentor"" on the weekend while she had a boyfriend..and strangely wanting me to join the golf league with her....and getting unusually upset when I didnt. But the biggest mistake i made was the following:

She asked how much I made...multiple times. By the third time I get her a rounded down answer where she quickly replied ""me too"" without even thinking....
I know..I know but I did low ball the amount....also her role doesnt pay that much either way so I think she was pissed when I told her my answer (kinda happy not to tell her the full amount) 

After that combined with not going to some type of event with her she went cold on me.

Fast forward to a week ago I go to a conference... I have a friend higher up on the management chain that works there and here comes this pick me girl acting like she never iced me in the beginning and was being extra friendly in order to talk to this person.

It was something out of a movie...like a mean girls went corporate movie. She tried to get my friends attention which they replied with ""excuse us im having a conversation nice to meet you"". She was pissed...wouldnt talk to me or go up to me rest of event.

I think this person was just trying to figure out if they can use me of some sorts or be close to me due to my ties with management...idk but im glad I dont have to listen to her uncomfortable stories about men anymore...

November 8th

There’s a rhythm to this store, the kind of rhythm that makes you forget clocks exist. Fluorescent lights hum like dying cicadas. The air conditioner wheezes like a smoker on his last cigarette. The tile floor is always just a little too sticky, no matter how many times I mop it.



Greg the raccoon was waiting on the counter when I opened up. He looked at me like I was late. I gave him a name tag that said “Customer Service Associate.” He immediately tried to eat it. Good enough.

The pigeons are still occupying Aisle 5. I tried to walk down it this morning, and one of them dive-bombed my head like a feathery missile. I gave up. Pasta noodles are officially out of stock until further notice.

The first customer of the day was a woman wearing three pairs of sunglasses stacked on top of each other. She didn’t browse, didn’t say hello. She walked straight to the freezer, opened the door, and screamed into it—like really let it rip. Then she smoothed her jacket, asked me for a receipt, and left without buying anything. I gave her a receipt. That seemed to satisfy her.

An hour later, a guy in full camo walked in, dragging a fishing pole. No bait, no tackle box, just the pole. He lowered the line into a storm drain in the middle of Aisle 3. I swear that drain wasn’t there yesterday. Twenty minutes later, he reeled up a moss-covered children’s shoe. He nodded, tipped his hat, and walked out like this was perfectly reasonable. The shoe’s still here. It keeps dripping.

Cheryl dropped by from the vape shop. She leaned against the counter, stared at Greg pawing the register, and said, “You should train him to do the night shift. Maybe then you’d finally get a break.”

I told her I didn’t think management would approve. She snorted and said, “Management doesn’t approve of anything.” Then she bought a pack of Chewze-It gum (now with 10% less chalk) and left.

It’s funny—she doesn’t see what’s wrong with this place, or maybe she does and just doesn’t care. Either way, she makes it feel almost normal for a few minutes.



By midnight the store was quiet. Too quiet. I started to believe I’d get an easy night. Then the lights flickered, one by one, like a trail leading me straight to Aisle 6.

The brooms were back in place, lined up like soldiers. I grabbed one off the shelf. The handle wasn’t covered in teeth this time. Instead, there was a tiny price tag dangling from the end:

“INVENTORY ITEM #001.”

I didn’t look at the others.

When I went back to the counter, there was a note waiting. Perfectly folded, sitting right where Greg had been napping:

“Inventory has begun.”

I threw it in the trash. Two minutes later, Greg climbed into the trash can, pulled the note back out, and dropped it on my lap. He looked at me with the dead-eyed seriousness of someone who knows more than he should.

I don’t know what tomorrow’s going to bring, but I’m starting to think I’ll need more than traffic cones.

November 9th
The day began the way most days here begin: with the air smelling faintly of bleach and despair, the flickering of a fluorescent bulb that no ladder has ever been tall enough to reach, and Greg the raccoon dragging a stale hot dog across the counter like it was his paycheck.
I would have stopped him, but honestly? If anyone deserves a hot dog breakfast in this place, it’s Greg.
The first customer was a man shaped like a beanbag chair who waddled in and asked me if we sold “ghost repellent.” I told him no, but we had Febreze on clearance. He bought four cans.
Next came a teenager who smelled like lighter fluid and carried a backpack full of what I’m pretty sure were frogs. He kept staring at the ceiling tiles and whispering, “You can’t have them back.” When I asked if he needed help finding anything, he said, “Yes. Do you sell time?”
I told him only in bulk. He didn’t laugh.
A woman in her seventies wandered in, dragging a leash with nothing attached. She told me her dog was invisible but very well-behaved. I didn’t argue. She bought a single can of cat food, winked, and left.
The pigeons from Aisle 5 are getting bold. One of them strutted up to the counter and pecked the register like it was trying to ring itself up. I asked for payment, and it dropped a button into the coin slot. Technically, that counts.
Cheryl swung by again, bought a bottle of knock-off soda (Dr. Pibbles), and said, “By the way, your store smells like onions and dead batteries.” I told her that was our seasonal fragrance. She laughed, but her eyes lingered on the dripping children’s shoe still sitting in Aisle 3. She didn’t say anything about it, though. That almost worried me more.
By the time midnight rolled around, I was so tired I almost forgot where I was. The aisles were quiet, except for the pigeons plotting in the shadows. I thought I might actually get through a shift without anything horrifying happening.
Then a customer walked in wearing what I can only describe as a mascot costume for a squirrel. The eyes were too big, the teeth too sharp, and the zipper was on the outside. He shuffled up to me, leaned close, and whispered, “Inventory likes you.”
Then he bought a pack of gum, paid in Canadian coins, and left.
I didn’t even bother writing a note about it for management. What’s the point? They’ll just file it under “normal.”
But as I locked up, I swear I heard scratching in the walls, like something trying to count.
November 10th

I woke up with a note duct-taped to my forehead.

“Remember to smile. Inventory is watching.”

No handwriting, no signature, no duct tape roll in sight. Just the note. I peeled it off, threw it in the trash, and came into work like nothing happened. Because what else can you do?

Greg was already waiting at the counter when I arrived, paws resting on the register like he’d been clocked in for hours. I checked the time sheet out of habit. His signature was there. Tiny paw prints in the ink.

I’m not sure if he works here now, or if I work for him.



The first customer was a man with no eyebrows who asked if we had “aisle 7 in stock.” I told him yes, and pointed. He walked down the aisle, stared at the shelves for fifteen minutes, then walked out empty-handed.

A woman came in next, cradling a baby swaddled in a blanket. She bought diapers, formula, and a plastic shovel. As I bagged her items, the baby looked straight at me and whispered—clear as day—“Four.”

I don’t know what that means. I don’t want to know.



The pigeons staged another coup in Aisle 5. I tried to chase them off with a broom, but when I pulled one from the shelf, the handle was labeled:

“Inventory Item #002.”

I dropped it immediately. The pigeons didn’t move. They just stared at me with their beady little eyes like they knew something I didn’t.

Cheryl came in around two, bought a lighter, and said, “Something feels… off today.”

I asked her to define “off.”

She shrugged, said, “More off than usual,” and left.

That was somehow worse.

The store was empty by midnight. I was restocking paper towels when the mascot squirrel walked in again—the one from yesterday with the too-big eyes and too-sharp teeth. This time, he didn’t buy anything. He just stood in the doorway and watched me.

I asked if he needed help.

He didn’t answer.

He didn’t move.

He just kept staring.

After what felt like an hour, the lights flickered. When they came back on, he was gone.

I went back to the counter and found another note waiting:

“Inventory is counting. Do not interfere.”

The trash can was empty. Greg was asleep. The note hadn’t been there five minutes earlier.

I think the store is shifting. I think the line between customer and stock is starting to blur. And I’m not sure which side of the register I’m standing on anymore.

November 11th (Break Room, 2:37 PM)

I don’t usually write these in the middle of a shift, but today feels like the kind of day where if I don’t keep track as it’s happening, I’m going to lose the thread. Or my sanity. Or both.

The morning started normal—by which I mean Greg the raccoon was sitting on the coffee machine, refusing to let me brew anything unless I paid him in peanuts. I don’t have peanuts. I gave him a granola bar. He took it.

The first customer was a man in a business suit that looked painted on. He walked like a marionette, stiff jerks of the knees and elbows, and when he got to the counter, he slapped down a pack of gum and asked, “Do you validate?”

I told him we validate parking. He said, “No. Do you validate me?”

I said, “You’re doing great, champ.”

He smiled too wide, took his gum, and left.

After him, the kid with the frog backpack came back. This time, it was croaking louder. He bought duct tape, three flashlights, and a plunger. I didn’t ask. He didn’t offer. But the frogs looked at me with the same glassy eyes as the pigeons.

I came back here for lunch, and that’s when I noticed it: the break room clock doesn’t tick anymore. The hands just… slide, like they’re melting around the numbers. Every time I look up, it’s a new time, but always ending in :37.

And then there’s the new sign taped to the fridge. I didn’t put it there. Cheryl didn’t put it there. Greg definitely didn’t put it there. It says:

“Inventory is hungry. Keep feeding the customers.”

I don’t know if it’s supposed to be comforting or a warning, but I haven’t had much of an appetite since I read it.

I can hear something moving in Aisle 6. The sound of cardboard sliding against cardboard. Like boxes shifting themselves.

I’ll write more tonight if I get the chance. Assuming the clock lets me.

For the V60, I use what should basically be an espresso size. I follow the James technique, and I finally grinded so much that the taste was a bit bitter - so I went back to a bit coarser. But, I never got the same body and taste I tried in that bar, maybe the fruit is there, but not the chocolate. I generally use 60g/l, but I tried also something up to 75g/l.

1nq8ruo,https://i.redd.it/w3u90bf4qbrf1.jpeg,Dedra & Kleya parallels; Cassian as Han’s drunk friend; Jyn Erso spinoff: more highlights from Starfury Invasion - Diego Luna and Elizabeth Dulau panel,"1. The most emotionally difficult scene to film? For Elizabeth: the hospital scene with Luthen. She did little preparation as she wanted the emotional impact to be real for her so walked into the room and let her instincts carry her. Diego said that while Cassian has so many losses, the loss of Maarva was very painful to have to go through, especially with the music and for him to have to witness it from afar and not be able to participate. 

2. Diego was asked about a Jyn Erso series or movie with Felicity Jones - “Yes, that would be very cool!” … “obviously I would say yes because I’m ‘audience’ first… I’m a fan.” He added that there are amazing stories that are possible about the characters in Rogue One because it is more about an event and we don’t know much about the people behind it. But he indicated that Jyn is the character who we do have a fair bit of information about already in the film thanks to the flashback scenes to her family. 

3. Elizabeth’s favourite costume was the blue velvet dress Kleya wore to the party in 2.06. ‘Chic and dangerous’ - like Kleya herself. It “had a little tail” but didn’t get much airtime. Diego mentioned how obsessed he is with costuming, adding that his mother was a costume designer and how each costume tells a story, even when the narrative doesn’t have the time. The Narkina 5 outfits he compared with “white envelopes”  that you have to put yourself in and immediately become just a number. But he narrowed down on Cassian’s jackets because they helped keep him warm because shooting in the UK is ‘freezing’ and they were ‘a good ally’. He expressed yet more venom re “freezing and raining” Blackpool and admiration for the extras wearing shorts. Re. the ending of episode 11: “It’s a very silent scene… because I couldn’t open my mouth’ because he was just so cold.

4. They were asked about what their characters would be doing in a different timeline (as per the Lego series). Elizabeth said this would be tricky as Kleya absolutely lives for and embodies the rebellion - that even she wouldn’t know what she could be without it after being raised by Luthen to embrace it. She did suggest that she would still have a no-nonsense attitude and be ‘bossing people around’, whatever she might be doing. Diego imagined Cassian as Han’s permanently drunk friend who lives in the bar because “it’s too cold outside” (bit of a theme emerging!) 

5. They were asked if they had stolen something from the set. No! Elizabeth constantly asked for tiny things but was refused - but she was tempted with Kleya’s earrings. She praised the detail on set, eg. things in drawers, that were just there for their immersion as actors and would never be seen on screen. Diego emphasised that you do not steal from set as “I really wanted to be welcomed back” and after a little hesitation told of a friend who “broke the rules in casting” for Rogue One and was found out and not cast at all. So he now takes the rules about security very seriously. But did retell the story about being given the Bryar pistol prop and being stopped at the airport. It genuinely kicks back, lights, turns and is heavy. Rule from the start of s1: “make sure it feels real” and the props team did a fantastic job. 

6. The young boy Cassian’s question re the effect of the ending (I did a separate post about that - link in comments) being Bix and the baby.

7. Favourite SW characters from when they were children and would they put them into Andor if they could? - Elizabeth is fascinated by Anakin and his journey but is glad that they steered clear of showing him though. Diego ‘grew up having nightmares with Darth Vader’ and spoke about the reveal at the end of Rogue One. But he loved working with ‘regular people’ characters for the show so no, he would not have liked Vader to be in it. 

8. Diego was asked about when he was cast in Rogue One and his reaction to the ending. He told the story of the long 4-5 months of getting cast from the first meeting with Gareth Edwards through to the final confirmation. He was shooting somewhere in Europe, got very drunk that night, looked “very pleased” the next morning and had lots of fun making up stories about why (family friendly audience here but in other interviews he’s gleefully talked about saying things like “I got laid last night!”) His father, however, was unimpressed with the news (just saying “Okay…?!”) because as far as he was concerned ‘if you’re not doing theatre you’re wasting your time”. Re the ending - there were lots of rumours about that changing and the ending reshooting but when he was cast he knew that would be it (ie that everyone dies).

9. Elizabeth also talked about being told she’d been cast (her first job!) and apparently told her friends/family “It’s part of a franchise you’ve definitely heard of but I can’t tell you what it is”. She had had a couple of auditions but they were still wavering about her and her agent said - ‘They need to know you can walk onto that set and be OK and able to handle the pressure… so walk into your next audition like you are the dog’s bollocks” (this is a very British expression - “the best there is”). And she was then told it would be at Pinewood - and with Stellan Skarsgård. Lots of praise for him for meeting her first for a coffee and putting her at her ease ‘because he has that magic’. She only found out about Kleya’s precise backstory just a month before s1 came out - had a conversation with TG when he went over it all. Elizabeth thinks that there’s a ‘beauty and love to their story but also something horrifying and dark’ so she loved all the contradictions. 

10. What resonated with them in the scripts? Elizabeth - this is unlike anything she had read and apparently TG mentioned Kleya’s eyes at about 15 different points throughout the s1 scripts. The dialogue itself is brilliantly sparse - every word has to be there so you have to work hard (which is also a gift for an actor) because your ‘internal life’ has to be so clear. Diego agreed and added that TG’s first ally is the production designer - it’s so much easier as an actor to envision a scene on the page if everything has been worked through first - even something as simple as where a character is in a room and which door they would use (because they are closest to it) So he writes for a specific space and you don’t have to interpret that when acting or blocking the scene. Normally he would need to invent a backstory but on Andor it was all worked already and it’s wonderful that “there’s a logic” to the scenes. (I think this is what Tony Gilroy meant by the scripts being ‘director and actor proof’!) 

11. Elizabeth was asked about the parallels between Dedra and Kleya - said she didn’t pick up this when filming but did when watching the show (had seen others pick up on the found family link between Cassian and Kleya too). Dedra is the way she is because of her particular upbringing but added that she believed people in her situation can also find their own path ‘so maybe there is scope for Dedra’. Diego laughed at this and pointed out Denise’s very different attitude at the previous panel: “Elizabeth wants to give hope to people but Denise is like “NO”!” :) 

(I’ve still got some notes from Denise, Kyle and Robert (Emms) panel and Fan-meet to come. )

I’m changing my job for the second time in the past two years and that kinda bothers me. 

I work in a beauty salons as an administrator. The problem is that I just can’t seem to build a good relationship with the owners. Normally, I’m very good at communication with a staff or clients, but with the owners there’s always some nonsense. 

So yesterday, after my two-week vacation, I came back to work and discovered that nothing had been done. Before leaving, I had specifically ordered materials to make sure they would arrive on time, so we wouldn’t run out and the masters would have everything they needed to work. But when I returned, I found out that no one had even paid for it. The owner is the one responsible for that. As a result, the coffee was completely gone, and no one had even reordered it. I had to start dealing with this all over again.

This is not something new for me, and I often find myself redoing tasks that should have been handled by others. So I spent the entire beginning of my shift taking care of things that hadn’t been done while I was away.

Then the owner arrived, she went into the restroom, then called me over and asked what kind of mess this was. I honestly didn’t understand what she meant. When I went in, she pointed to the air freshener. The little lid was sitting on top of it, not snapped into place. It wasn’t thrown around, it wasn’t broken, it was just not fully clicked in. And she called this a mess, demanding to know why the air freshener wasn’t properly closed.

I was completely shocked, especially after spending my whole morning fixing all the things that others had failed to do — including tasks that are supposed to be the owner’s responsibility. She had definitely been in the salon before, seen everything, and yet still hadn’t taken care of the coffee.

This situation really frustrated me. I ended up writing her a long message explaining that I had spent the whole morning covering for things that were simply neglected. I also wrote that it was absurd to make such a big deal about an air freshener lid. Her response was that it was my duty to make sure everything in the restroom was perfectly arranged, labels facing clients, and that if something was on the wrong shelf, that was already a “mess.”

Everyone keeps telling me I’m just taking this too personally, that she was simply in a bad mood. But it really bothers me that after I wrote such a long message, she didn’t even apologize. She completely ignored my points about things not being done, and simply told me it was my job.

So I want to ask: am I really just taking things too personally? Do I need to change my attitude towards comments from my employer? Because several people have already told me that. But deep down, my sense of fairness doesn’t let me just let it go. I truly do a lot for the hourly wage we receive, and yet no one ever thanks me — and instead I get criticized over something as trivial as a lid.

There’s a rhythm to this store, the kind of rhythm that makes you forget clocks exist. Fluorescent lights hum like dying cicadas. The air conditioner wheezes like a smoker on his last cigarette. The tile floor is always just a little too sticky, no matter how many times I mop it.

Next came a teenager who smelled like lighter fluid and carried a backpack full of what I’m pretty sure were frogs. He kept staring at the ceiling tiles and whispering, “You can’t have them back.” When I asked if he needed help finding anything, he said, “Yes. Do you sell time?”
I told him only in bulk. He didn’t laugh.
A woman in her seventies wandered in, dragging a leash with nothing attached. She told me her dog was invisible but very well-behaved. I didn’t argue. She bought a single can of cat food, winked, and left.
The pigeons from Aisle 5 are getting bold. One of them strutted up to the counter and pecked the register like it was trying to ring itself up. I asked for payment, and it dropped a button into the coin slot. Technically, that counts.
Cheryl swung by again, bought a bottle of knock-off soda (Dr. Pibbles), and said, “By the way, your store smells like onions and dead batteries.” I told her that was our seasonal fragrance. She laughed, but her eyes lingered on the dripping children’s shoe still sitting in Aisle 3. She didn’t say anything about it, though. That almost worried me more.
By the time midnight rolled around, I was so tired I almost forgot where I was. The aisles were quiet, except for the pigeons plotting in the shadows. I thought I might actually get through a shift without anything horrifying happening.
Then a customer walked in wearing what I can only describe as a mascot costume for a squirrel. The eyes were too big, the teeth too sharp, and the zipper was on the outside. He shuffled up to me, leaned close, and whispered, “Inventory likes you.”
Then he bought a pack of gum, paid in Canadian coins, and left.
I didn’t even bother writing a note about it for management. What’s the point? They’ll just file it under “normal.”
But as I locked up, I swear I heard scratching in the walls, like something trying to count.
November 10th

I woke up with a note duct-taped to my forehead.

“Remember to smile. Inventory is watching.”

No handwriting, no signature, no duct tape roll in sight. Just the note. I peeled it off, threw it in the trash, and came into work like nothing happened. Because what else can you do?

Greg was already waiting at the counter when I arrived, paws resting on the register like he’d been clocked in for hours. I checked the time sheet out of habit. His signature was there. Tiny paw prints in the ink.

I’m not sure if he works here now, or if I work for him.



The first customer was a man with no eyebrows who asked if we had “aisle 7 in stock.” I told him yes, and pointed. He walked down the aisle, stared at the shelves for fifteen minutes, then walked out empty-handed.

A woman came in next, cradling a baby swaddled in a blanket. She bought diapers, formula, and a plastic shovel. As I bagged her items, the baby looked straight at me and whispered—clear as day—“Four.”

I don’t know what that means. I don’t want to know.



The pigeons staged another coup in Aisle 5. I tried to chase them off with a broom, but when I pulled one from the shelf, the handle was labeled:

“Inventory Item #002.”

I dropped it immediately. The pigeons didn’t move. They just stared at me with their beady little eyes like they knew something I didn’t.

Cheryl came in around two, bought a lighter, and said, “Something feels… off today.”

I asked her to define “off.”

She shrugged, said, “More off than usual,” and left.

That was somehow worse.

The store was empty by midnight. I was restocking paper towels when the mascot squirrel walked in again—the one from yesterday with the too-big eyes and too-sharp teeth. This time, he didn’t buy anything. He just stood in the doorway and watched me.

I asked if he needed help.

He didn’t answer.

He didn’t move.

He just kept staring.

After what felt like an hour, the lights flickered. When they came back on, he was gone.

I went back to the counter and found another note waiting:

“Inventory is counting. Do not interfere.”

The trash can was empty. Greg was asleep. The note hadn’t been there five minutes earlier.

I think the store is shifting. I think the line between customer and stock is starting to blur. And I’m not sure which side of the register I’m standing on anymore.

November 11th (Break Room, 2:37 PM)

I don’t usually write these in the middle of a shift, but today feels like the kind of day where if I don’t keep track as it’s happening, I’m going to lose the thread. Or my sanity. Or both.

The morning started normal—by which I mean Greg the raccoon was sitting on the coffee machine, refusing to let me brew anything unless I paid him in peanuts. I don’t have peanuts. I gave him a granola bar. He took it.

The first customer was a man in a business suit that looked painted on. He walked like a marionette, stiff jerks of the knees and elbows, and when he got to the counter, he slapped down a pack of gum and asked, “Do you validate?”

I told him we validate parking. He said, “No. Do you validate me?”

I said, “You’re doing great, champ.”

He smiled too wide, took his gum, and left.

After him, the kid with the frog backpack came back. This time, it was croaking louder. He bought duct tape, three flashlights, and a plunger. I didn’t ask. He didn’t offer. But the frogs looked at me with the same glassy eyes as the pigeons.

I came back here for lunch, and that’s when I noticed it: the break room clock doesn’t tick anymore. The hands just… slide, like they’re melting around the numbers. Every time I look up, it’s a new time, but always ending in :37.

And then there’s the new sign taped to the fridge. I didn’t put it there. Cheryl didn’t put it there. Greg definitely didn’t put it there. It says:

“Inventory is hungry. Keep feeding the customers.”

I don’t know if it’s supposed to be comforting or a warning, but I haven’t had much of an appetite since I read it.

I can hear something moving in Aisle 6. The sound of cardboard sliding against cardboard. Like boxes shifting themselves.

I’ll write more tonight if I get the chance. Assuming the clock lets me.

‍

**Why This Pick?**  


The Red Sox offense should have no problem scoring against Toronto, friends. Boston has had little to no issue with the Blue Jays’ starters, I expect them to put at least 5 on the board today as the Blue Jays do a deep dive into their bullpen. Now, having said that, I’m looking to the Toronto offense to get out of their \[seemingly endless\] funk against Brayan Bello (3.34 ERA). Bello has allowed 7 runs on just 10 hits over his last 2 starts. As the Blue Jays are now tied with the Yankees in a race for the division win, I can’t think of a better incentive for them to start scoring some runs and avoid getting swept. My money’s on the Over to cash today, friends.

It feels like malnutrition and it's affecting negatively my life.

I'm 22 this year. I haven been stagnant in a certain weight for almost 5 or 6 years, until few months ago where eating became randomly so difficult to me. 

I do get hungry but once i start to eat i get full quickly and then I notice that I still have a lot in plate so I start to panic and I get heart palpitations and so it gets even harder to eat.  

I know that me drinking coffee on empty stomach caused me stomach pain everymorning that I have to space my meals that sometimes I just skip them. I don't see how this explains the weight loss and the challenge that eating became. 


I don't know who I should see, who to talk to, I'm just struggling.

November 8th

There’s a rhythm to this store, the kind of rhythm that makes you forget clocks exist. Fluorescent lights hum like dying cicadas. The air conditioner wheezes like a smoker on his last cigarette. The tile floor is always just a little too sticky, no matter how many times I mop it.



Greg the raccoon was waiting on the counter when I opened up. He looked at me like I was late. I gave him a name tag that said “Customer Service Associate.” He immediately tried to eat it. Good enough.

The pigeons are still occupying Aisle 5. I tried to walk down it this morning, and one of them dive-bombed my head like a feathery missile. I gave up. Pasta noodles are officially out of stock until further notice.

The first customer of the day was a woman wearing three pairs of sunglasses stacked on top of each other. She didn’t browse, didn’t say hello. She walked straight to the freezer, opened the door, and screamed into it—like really let it rip. Then she smoothed her jacket, asked me for a receipt, and left without buying anything. I gave her a receipt. That seemed to satisfy her.

An hour later, a guy in full camo walked in, dragging a fishing pole. No bait, no tackle box, just the pole. He lowered the line into a storm drain in the middle of Aisle 3. I swear that drain wasn’t there yesterday. Twenty minutes later, he reeled up a moss-covered children’s shoe. He nodded, tipped his hat, and walked out like this was perfectly reasonable. The shoe’s still here. It keeps dripping.

Cheryl dropped by from the vape shop. She leaned against the counter, stared at Greg pawing the register, and said, “You should train him to do the night shift. Maybe then you’d finally get a break.”

I told her I didn’t think management would approve. She snorted and said, “Management doesn’t approve of anything.” Then she bought a pack of Chewze-It gum (now with 10% less chalk) and left.

It’s funny—she doesn’t see what’s wrong with this place, or maybe she does and just doesn’t care. Either way, she makes it feel almost normal for a few minutes.



By midnight the store was quiet. Too quiet. I started to believe I’d get an easy night. Then the lights flickered, one by one, like a trail leading me straight to Aisle 6.

The brooms were back in place, lined up like soldiers. I grabbed one off the shelf. The handle wasn’t covered in teeth this time. Instead, there was a tiny price tag dangling from the end:

“INVENTORY ITEM #001.”

I didn’t look at the others.

When I went back to the counter, there was a note waiting. Perfectly folded, sitting right where Greg had been napping:

“Inventory has begun.”

I threw it in the trash. Two minutes later, Greg climbed into the trash can, pulled the note back out, and dropped it on my lap. He looked at me with the dead-eyed seriousness of someone who knows more than he should.

I don’t know what tomorrow’s going to bring, but I’m starting to think I’ll need more than traffic cones.

November 9th
The day began the way most days here begin: with the air smelling faintly of bleach and despair, the flickering of a fluorescent bulb that no ladder has ever been tall enough to reach, and Greg the raccoon dragging a stale hot dog across the counter like it was his paycheck.
I would have stopped him, but honestly? If anyone deserves a hot dog breakfast in this place, it’s Greg.
The first customer was a man shaped like a beanbag chair who waddled in and asked me if we sold “ghost repellent.” I told him no, but we had Febreze on clearance. He bought four cans.

Our first update in the link: 


We had been very fortunate that things had been going good for us. 

Some of the achievements from the last year: 

I asked for a raise but it took almost a year in a half to get it, but Im very happy to say that now is a six figure salary. Also being able to hit the bonuses that I didn’t the previous years. 

The housing market is moving in our area and we found our dream home, that we purchased at the beginning of the year. It was a big milestone in our lives.

Our good old 2003 German car (that I sold for more than I bought it), was replaced for a 2015 Japanese SUV for her business, paid in cash. I do basic maintenance on it myself.

We keep saving and investing aggressively, avoiding debt at all costs. Our investments had grown despite the big purchases we did.

Frugality is still a big part in our day to day routine, and side gigs whenever the opportunity comes. We didn’t upgrade any stuff at the new place and our furniture, bed, and kitchen stuff is close to 8 years. One upgrade we want to do is the mattress.

We hope we can continue in similar situation and push it hard and for the next 5-10 years and that would leave us in a good financial position for the retirement phase. 

She helps me to control with the small stuff as I’m tempted by convenience purchases (like daily coffee), and I look after the big ones as she was afraid of investing, purchasing a car, or a place.

Our Morocco trip hasn’t happened yet as we had been swamped with work, but we do mini vacations around our area each month. Summer was really good hitting swimming holes in the area. Next one will be around the Washington coast and next spring maybe New York.

We don’t see ourselves retiring early, but having the option would be great.

It happened in April. He looked at me, and it was my second time being there. When he saw me, he couldn’t stop looking at me, and when i walked next to him with my friend, he smiled. Eh??

Then i started going there, cuz the coffee shop was nice and close to my uni. I always saw him there, and he always looked at me. 

Then after 4 or something months, i went there with my another friend. Then she suddenly said that “HE CANT STOP LOOKING AT YOU” and i was feeling his gaze on me. He really didn’t look away but me. We didn’t only see each other in coffee shop. He was sometimes wondering around, whenever I was walking towards the shop. 

Then, after a few weeks, i went there again. And he actually didn’t give a shit, just looked at me for a few seconds and that’s all. And then a young girl came in, walked next to him, and they just hugged, blah blah… I think it was his friend, i don’t think it was his gf. 

Well, he looks like a damn 21-22 years old man. But i actually saw him in my uni before, so i thought maybe he was a student as well. But today, I saw him in a class, SITTING ON TEACHERS TABLE. Then he went to grab his belongings from TEACHERS BUFFET. And i searched him, and found him in my university site, staff part. And i couldn’t believe my eyes, when i calculated his age. HE’S PROBABLY OVER 33+😭🙏🏻 i don’t wanna exist for a while

And then look AT THE CHANCE, when i left the uni, he also finished lecturing his class (probably) and we went to metro at the same time. We were stepping forward and keeping the other behind, and vice versa, as if we were running from each other. He didn’t even lift his head up from his damn phone. Ima need a fresh brain AND MAN, NO I KNOW THATS CREEPY AS HELL 🔥 think about someone, entering university when you WEREN’T EVEN BORN AND AFTER YEARS, THIS HAPPENS. ",2,1758811273.0,story,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Thanks again for your support & interest over here on r/VintageMenswearDeals!

**Styling Ideas**

So you’re thinking of buying a vintage American-style canvas barn jacket. But you’re concerned that you’re going to look [identical to every other guy](https://theonion.com/mr-autumn-man-walking-down-street-with-cup-of-coffee-1819574012/) at the pumpkin patch. Or perhaps even worse, maybe you’re worried about looking like a [politician](https://theonion.com/voter-just-needs-to-know-which-candidate-chops-wood-in-1830103573/) who’s inexplicably found himself [in the woods](https://rollcall.com/2016/02/09/the-100-jacket-politicians-use-to-pretend-to-be-normal-people/) for [the first time](https://www.insideelections.com/news/article/the-barn-jacket-as-a-secret-campaign-weapon).

Fear not! A little bit of styling goes a long way in making these jackets look good. Here are some suggestions:

1. Find One With Real Character
2. Get a Unique Example
3. Make It Your Own
4. Layer & Accessorize

***Idea #1: Find One With Real Character***

You’re already buying a used jacket, so instead of getting the most pristine version, lean into the vintage part of vintage fashion and get a jacket that has some real character to it. One that’s actually been worn and used over the years rather than sitting untouched in a closet. A jacket that perhaps has some stories to tell…

https://preview.redd.it/2ljw48fwnbrf1.png?width=3160&format=png&auto=webp&s=30c9c5ba8c5471562f9a41adca3498362e737c50

Look for things like the following:

* **Rips, Tears, & Holes**
   * Real wear and tear that adds character, yet isn’t so severe to affect functionality.
   * Perhaps the damage has already been repaired or would be an easy fix before it gets any worse.
   * Or maybe the damage is not repaired at all, but is moderate enough to look good as is.
* **Fading**
   * I love the look of nice, natural, deep fades in a jacket that’s been used and worn and washed over and over.
   * But try to avoid fading that’s really uneven, like can happen if the jacket was baking in the sun for years on one side only.
* **Stains & Dirt**
   * Along with some rips, tears, & holes, look for a jacket with some stains & dirt, like the truly baked in kind where there’s always gonna be some remnant even after you do a super deep clean.
   * Saying that, I would probably avoid ink stains or bleach marks or anything that makes the jacket look like a total disaster, but some permanent staining can look really good.

***Idea #2: Get a Unique Example***

While I think the classic tan-colored L.L. Bean barn jacket still works (especially when it’s a vintage one with some character), perhaps you’d like something less uncommon, more rare, or perhaps even unusual.

https://preview.redd.it/25hlpui0obrf1.png?width=3054&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec7a1ad6dbf8c564a147ba24b7ea20056634c221

There are a few good options if you’re looking for a more unique jacket:

* **Less Common Colorways**
   * Recent L.L. Bean barn jackets have come in a bunch of different colorways (particularly in the women’s versions), but the vintage MiUSA jackets also came in colors beyond just the standard tan version.
   * These alternate colors are more rare, but if you can find one, I think the blue/navy & olive/green jackets look really nice. They even made some versions in denim, as seen above.
* **Less Common Brands**
   * There were tons of brands selling MiUSA versions of these jackets, many of which are defunct now.
   * So rather than just grabbing the first L.L. Bean jacket that you find, try hunting a little deeper for a more unique example from a lesser known brand.
   * Keep reading below for how to search for and find jackets from these less common brands.
* **Unusual Features**
   * Since these jackets were originally designed for function rather than fashion, there are a lot of versions with different features than the modern standard from L.L. Bean or J.Crew.
   * Look for things like different pocket layouts, contrast padded shoulders, or a mix of materials.
   * And see the links below for a bunch of jackets like this from other brands, including every jacket in the photos above, all grouped by approximate size.

***Idea #3: Make It Your Own***

One of my small storage boxes contains a modest sized collection of patches and buttons that I’ve either bought as souvenirs, gotten from giveaways, or picked up at vintage shops. Derek Guy [suggests](https://dieworkwear.com/2023/10/16/excited-to-wear-this-fall-3/) to use your patch collection on a canvas bag, but I think they can also look quite good on a vintage canvas jacket:

https://preview.redd.it/fbzwyrw6obrf1.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c0a9b4459e146a83e27dc486524a27921ef52a1

If you’re short on button and patch inventory, Jesse Thorn has a [really nice selection](https://putthisonshop.com/collections/pins) at the PutThisOn Shop. Or you can find tons of examples on eBay of buttons and patches related to [political campaigns](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=%28vtg%2C+vintage%29+campaign+%28button%2C+pin%2C+patch%29&_sacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=%28vtg%2C+vintage%29+campaign+%28button%2C+pin%2C+patchj%29&_osacat=0&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5339123536&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1), [camping & the outdoors](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=%28vtg%2C+vintage%29+%28outdoors%2C+camping%29+%28button%2C+pin%2C+patch%29&_sacat=1&_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=%28vtg%2C+vintage%29+%28bean%2C+outdoors%2C+hunting%2C+camp%2C+camping%29+%28button%2C+pin%2C+patch%29&_osacat=1&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5339123536&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1), [sports teams](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=%28vtg%2C+vintage%29+%28sports%2C+mlb%2C+nfl%2C+nba%2C+nhl%2C+football%2C+basketball%2C+hockey%2C+baseball%29+%28button%2C+pin%2C+patch%29&_sacat=1&_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=%28vtg%2C+vintage%29+%28nfl%2C+nba%2C+football%2C+basketball%29+%28button%2C+pin%2C+patch%29&_osacat=1&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5339123536&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1), etc. Time to take a risk and give it a shot!

***Idea #4: Layer & Accessorize***

Brian Davis of [Wooden Sleepers](https://wooden-sleepers.com) is a master of making vintage American workwear look really cool. So definitely check out his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/woodensleepers/) for inspiration on how to style a barn jacket and other similar pieces.

What Brian’s photos really show is how to build an outfit with layers of color and multiple textures. And then how to pick accessories that complement and complete the whole thing.

https://preview.redd.it/6bu4b0gaobrf1.png?width=3212&format=png&auto=webp&s=0279303498fdda497b7579fc3b5a8f1dfd4a502a

If you have a barn jacket that’s reasonably close fitting, maybe try an outfit like the following:

* Start with a chambray or faded denim workshirt, or perhaps a vintage [rugby shirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageMenswearDeals/comments/1nl5ida/deep_dive_rubgy_shirts/).
* For a tan jacket, try a pair of green pants, such as fatigues, cargos, or cotton chinos, or whatever darker jeans you like.
* For a navy or green jacket, try a pair of tan/khaki pants, such as canvas work pants, carpenter double knee pants, or cotton chinos.
* To accessorize, see how you feel with a [bandana tied around your neck](https://www.putthison.com/theres-an-alarming-number-of-bandana-guys/). (You can do it, I believe in you!) And then  pick a hat that works with the weather, be that a well-worn baseball cap, floppy bucket hat, or a gray wool beanie.
* For footwear, if you’re not going for the full catalog look with your [Bean Boots](https://putthison.com/its-on-sale-ll-bean-duck-boots/), I’d probably go for brown workbooks or beat up gray sneakers, or whatever you have that will work well with the activities you have planned.

If your barn jacket is a bit more loose and boxy (i.e. it kinda looks like you’re drowning in a sack if worn over just a thin shirt), try filling things out with an additional chunky layer or two. Some possibilities:

* [Plaid wool overshirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageMenswearDeals/comments/1nitenj/deep_dive_vintage_woolrich_shirts/)
* [Aran sweater](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageMenswearDeals/comments/1nikvjf/vintage_deals_on_ebay_sweaters_for_the_fall_part_1/)
* [Faded red hoodie](https://wooden-sleepers.com/products/vintage-champion-m-i-t-hooded-sweatshirt)

**Going Beyond L.L. Bean**

The largest number of vintage barn jackets on eBay are from L.L. Bean, but you can also find other great vintage jackets from brands like [Duxbak](https://ebay.us/pE19VO), [Drybak](https://ebay.us/jCdujy), [Red Head](https://ebay.us/LLOfEZ), & [American Field](https://ebay.us/SniCyR). (If you’re curious, here’s some [additional history](https://www.thefedoralounge.com/threads/the-history-of-hunting-clothes-a-fedora-lounge-guide.84519/) on these other pre-WW2 hunting brands.)

After some rather extensive eBay searching the past few days, I’ve been able to find 50+ brands that were selling MiUSA barn jackets at one point or another. I’ve collected some nice examples in the links below, but if you want to deep dive yourself, here are some searches to get you started:

* [SafTBak / Saf T Bak](https://ebay.us/i6DbNM)
* [Bullseye Bill](https://ebay.us/DEBniG)
* [Sears / Roebuck / JC Higgins](https://ebay.us/YnQJWi)
* [Weather Chief](https://ebay.us/otBFsF)
* [Bob Allen](https://ebay.us/bHyMZp)
* [Black Sheep](https://ebay.us/gKxQ9X)

You can also change the item category to either of the following to find a ton of additional examples:

* Clothing -> Specialty -> Vintage -> Men’s Vintage Clothing -> Outerwear Coats & Jackets
* Sporting Goods -> Hunting -> Clothing Shoes & Accessories -> Coats & Jackets

**Barn Jackets by Size**

For anyone with less time (or who is perhaps less obsessive than I am), I’ve also selected examples by size for both the L.L. Bean versions and ones from other MiUSA brands, including every specific jacket that’s depicted in the photos above.

(Note: The second list will be especially useful for the small boys. The majority of vintage MiUSA L.L. Bean barn jackets on eBay are size L, XL, or XXL. But you can find a good number of size S & M jackets in some of the less common brands.)

It was a competition roast sold at a roaster/cafe called Terroir.BKK in Bangkok, Thailand. It was really limited, they only served it on weekends and not at all anymore. And i ASSUME the roast blend is a secret recipe so i never bothered to ask them directly.

But as I said it was a very interesting sweet-savory but fruity kind of flat white where I even tasted some caramelized notes that reminded me of gorgonzola cheese. It was super umami, I couldn't say it was objectively salty, but it was definitely sweet-savory.

From what it tasted like to me, it was a light-medium roast. At most, a true medium.

Could anyone enlighten me about what I'm tasting in terms of origin/process/roast level? Any insight? I have been chasing this cup through different bags and bags of beans I've bought but no luck.

1nq8hou,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeAustralia/comments/1nq8hou/purpose_of_human_life_civilization/,purpose of human life & civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1758811014.0,TrueCrimeAustralia,0,1.0,False

We’re looking for both a sunny beach, snorkeling, surfing lessons, access to many restaurants, but also beautiful lush views, quiet, quaint, and romantic. We’re looking for hotels that are more boutique and quiet with less crowds and families for our honeymoon. We decided on 4 nights at Ko’a Kea Resort and 2 nights at 1 Hotel in Hanalei in June/July. Any thoughts or advice on the hotels / itinerary? Would be very helpful!

Friday: Check into Ko’a Kea Resort

Saturday: spend the day at our resort and check out Poipu 

Sunday: Napali Coast boat tour leaving from the north (drive up north very early in the am), spend the rest of the day at Tunnels Beach, have dinner in Hanalei or way home through Kapaa

Monday: Waimea Canyon and Kauai Coffee Company Tour

Tuesday: Check into 1 Hotel Hanalei

Wednesday: stay at our hotel and golf in Princeville 

Thursday: Fly home 

I’ve read boat tours leaving from the north side are smoother and quicker so we decided to drive up to the north instead of leaving from the south. We can’t pay for a 3rd night at the 1 Hotel, once we’re staying there I do not want to leave! I want to enjoy the amenities and stay there for how much we’re paying lol so that’s why we’re taking a trip up north for the day even though we’re staying there later in the trip.

Questions for the community:
1. 
Are you invested in any AG Ventures portfolio companies?
2. 
How legit are these Canva/SpaceX claims? (Seems too good to be true for a 2022-founded Indian VC)
3. 
Anyone tracking Duncan Engineering? (Their 50% holding - profitable but 0.64% revenue CAGR)
4. 
Thoughts on the Goenka family background? (Business legacy since 1800s)
Red Flags? I couldn't find any controversies about the promoters, but the Canva/SpaceX thing seems almost too ambitious. Are they just minor LP positions or actual direct investments?
Financial Health:
 
AG Ventures Ltd (public company) has 18.3M market cap
 
Revenue: 12.5M (TTM)
 
Almost debt-free
 
Stock down from 4.96 to1.84 (52-week range)
Would love to hear if anyone has done deeper due diligence on them. The portfolio looks impressive on paper but want to understand the real story behind these big-name investments.
TL;DR: AG Ventures claims big investments in Canva & SpaceX alongside Indian startups. Too good to be true or legit player? What's the real deal here?

With smart speakers and assistants, customers often search and shop without even looking at a screen.

# ✅ Pros

* **Growing Usage** → Hands-free, convenient, especially for local searches.
* **Early Adopter Advantage** → Few brands optimize for voice = lower competition.
* **SEO Boost** → Conversational, long-tail keywords rank better.
* **Integration with Smart Devices** → Shopping via Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant.

# ❌ Cons

* **Low Visual Branding** → No logos, no visuals, just voice results.
* **One Result Problem** → Voice often gives just *one* answer → winner-takes-all.
* **Tracking is Harder** → Attribution in voice search is messy.
* **Limited Control** → Relying on platforms like Amazon/Google.

I see houses everywhere I go, all with people who live in them. I see people order a coffee at lunch and people drinking at bars on the weekend. This is how most people live right? Decent, at least comfortable and survivable lives. Where they can afford nice things, and can spend £5 on a drink without thinking about how that sets them back one meal that week. They even have savings, EXTRA money they can afford to put aside. 

My question is; How the hell are people able to live like this? I am a British 30yr f cybersecurity university graduate, stuck in a dead end call centre job at 24k a year. I cannot get a job without experience, and I cannot get experience without a job. I don't even make enough money to live alone I live in a house share with 7 strangers. Which still costs nearly half my pay check. I can't even afford to park outside work. I wake up at 6am to get a free spot a 10 minute walk from work, and sit in my car for over a hour. I try to manage what little money I have left, but I am always left with nothing before next payday. I don't go out, I don't drink, I don't drive anywhere but work to save fuel costs. I just don't live. I don't have fun. I don't go on dates because I can't afford them. I ran out of butter so eat plain bread to fill my stomach in the morning. 

I am so tired. I feel like such a failure and a waste of space. People tell me ""it will be ok"" and it hurts because I just don't believe it anymore. Where did I go wrong? Why don't I get to live like that? I am so so tired and honestly, if it wouldn't break my mums heart I'd probably put myself out of my misery.

1nq8aip,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1nq8aip/evaluate_msvvko_toilet_cleaner_bottles_are_they/,Evaluate Msvvko Toilet Cleaner Bottles Are They Worth the Flush,"Testing and evaluating products is something I take quite seriously, and the Msvvko B-two-01 toilet bowl cleaner quickly caught my attention. At first glance, it seemed like one of those household cleaning items promising too much, but I decided to give it a thorough go. With a bathroom that sees daily use from family and occasional visiting friends, this cleaner had plenty of opportunities to prove itself in a real-world setting. Here's what I found out.

**Design and Packaging**  
This product comes neatly packed, featuring a set of six bottles that aim to eliminate the usual hassle associated with bathroom maintenance. Each bottle feels lightweight yet sturdy, and the rope design is surprisingly clever. It’s not often I get impressed by something as mundane as a cleaning product’s physical design, but the way the rope system lets you lower and lift the bottle into the toilet tank without getting your hands wet is genuinely thoughtful—not to mention, it keeps things as sanitary as possible. The individual packaging of the bottles also ensures they remain in pristine condition until needed.

[Grab Msvvko B-two-01 at the best price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b0drjdhph1/)

**Cleaning Efficiency**  
Most cleaning products boast about their effectiveness, but how many actually deliver consistently? Using this toilet bowl cleaner, I noticed a clear difference in how the bowl looked after each flush. A bright blue solution flows through the inside corners of the toilet, tackling areas that are often hard to clean manually. It's not just cosmetic either; the cleaning agents reduce visible stains and keep odors in check. While it’s not a substitute for a good scrub with a toilet brush, it definitely lengthens the time between deep cleans. The product’s description claims up to 2300 flushes per bottle, and while I didn’t exactly keep count (who would?), I can confidently say each bottle lasted several weeks of regular use.

**Longevity and Replaceability**  
I found myself pleasantly surprised by how long these bottles lasted. Imagine not having to think about cleaning your toilet for close to three months—pure bliss for someone with a packed schedule. What’s even better is the accessible design. When it’s time for a replacement, the blue tint fades noticeably, so you’re not left guessing. Once that happens, you simply unhook the used bottle and place a fresh one in. Minimal effort, zero mess.  

**Convenience and Ease of Use**  
Setting up the cleaner was uncomplicated—drop it into the tank, give it 30 minutes to dissolve, and then flush. That’s it. I appreciated how effortless the process was, especially on those busy mornings when I barely have time to make coffee. With sustained-release technology, the cleaner does what it promises with every flush, which is all you can really ask for in a product like this. That said, families with young children or nosy pets should store spare bottles out of reach since they’re not exactly toys.  

**Boons**  
- Easy-to-use rope design keeps hands clean  
- Eliminates odors while leaving a fresh scent  
- Long-lasting usage reduces frequent replacements  
- Safe for septic systems, even with metal and plastic components  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- It doesn’t replace manual scrubbing entirely  
- Blue tint might not appeal to everyone visually  
- Needs careful storage to avoid accidents with kids and pets  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared with similar products on the market—like Clorox toilet cleaning tablets or Lysol’s automatic bowl cleaners—this cleaner holds its own quite impressively. The blue tint adds an aesthetic cleanliness that brands like Lysol don’t typically provide. Many competing cleaners don’t last nearly as long or require more frequent replacements, which can ultimately add up in cost over time. However, some competitors offer scented options that might better suit picky noses that aren’t a fan of this cleaner’s somewhat basic fragrance. Clorox also benefits from being a more universally recognized brand. Still, I found Msvvko to be highly practical and sufficiently reliable.  

**Value for Money**  
Thinking about the price versus performance, I find this product highly worth it. Considering the extended lifespan of each bottle and the effort put into its user-centric design, it feels like money well spent. Instead of multiple purchases of less effective cleaners, this six-pack easily carries you through over a year of hassle-free sanitation. Investing in something that consistently performs is always worth it—and this cleaner easily proves its worth.

We've played before and we all enjoyed it.

In our group chat, Friend #1 asks, ""What time do you have in mind for basketball tomorrow?""  
Me: ""Let's aim for 9am? Let's beat the heat.""  
He thumbs up my message.

Morning of, 8:30am. ""Looking forward to playing with y'all today!""

Friend #1 and Friend #2 live together. We're both 30 minutes away from the spot we agreed to play at. That means they would have needed to be leaving right then.

Friend #1: ""I'm up making a coffee. Friend #2 is still in bed.""

Me: ""Oh okay, would 9:30 be better for yall?""  
He thumbs up my message.

Friend #2 still shows up at 9:45 anyway. 

What pisses me off is that if I hadn't texted, I would have got there at 9 and been waiting around for 30-45 minutes waiting for them.

What extra pisses me off is that I actually felt a little guilt for being kinda moody when they showed up and we first started our game. They didn't say anything, but it often feels like I can't be outwardly upset about things like this because now \*I\* would be the problem.

What extra, extra pisses me off is that we've talked about this before. A similar incident happened recently and they apologized and said they'd work on their communication skills. Yet...

Perhaps I'm the asshole, because I do know Friend #2 was tired after having to do 5-6 hours long-distance drives that weekend for work. Yet, we scheduled our basketball game before those came up––or at least before I knew about them––and she never asked to cancel. 

I know the issue is small, but the lack of consideration and communication is bothersome. AITA?",9,1758810542.0,AmItheAsshole,28,0.77,False

1nq89gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nq89gn/what_is_the_best_coffee_grinder_for_beginners/,What is the best coffee grinder for beginners?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on quite a journey trying to find the perfect coffee grinder, and I thought I'd share my experience to help other beginners avoid the mistakes I made. Trust me, I've been through the frustration of inconsistent grinds and wasted beans!

When I first started getting into coffee, I used pre-ground beans (I know, I know). But once I discovered the difference fresh grinding makes, there was no going back. The aroma and flavor are just on another level.

After tons of research and testing different grinders, I found that [this coffee grinder](https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) is probably the best option for beginners. It's easy to use, delivers consistent results, and won't break the bank.

Here's what I've learned to look for in a beginner-friendly coffee grinder:

1. Burr vs. Blade Grinders
Burr grinders are definitely the way to go. They give you consistent particle size, which is crucial for even extraction. Blade grinders just chop randomly, leading to bitter or sour coffee.

2. Ease of Use
As a beginner, you want something straightforward. Look for grinders with clearly marked grind settings and simple controls. The one I mentioned earlier [here](https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) has 15 easy-to-understand settings.

3. Capacity
Think about how much coffee you typically make. For most beginners, a grinder that holds 8-12 ounces of beans is plenty.

4. Cleaning and Maintenance
Trust me, you want something that's easy to clean. Some grinders are a nightmare to maintain, but the good ones come apart easily for cleaning.

5. Noise Level
This might not seem important until you're grinding beans at 6 AM while everyone's sleeping! Some grinders are significantly quieter than others.

I've found that electric burr grinders are perfect for beginners. Manual grinders are great too, but they require more effort and time. If you're just starting out, an electric burr grinder will give you the best balance of quality and convenience.

Pro Tips I've Learned:
- Clean your grinder regularly (at least monthly)
- Don't store beans in the hopper
- Grind only what you need for each brew
- Start with medium grind size and adjust from there
- Pay attention to static buildup (a few drops of water on your beans helps)

Remember, your grinder is actually more important than your coffee maker. You can make decent coffee with a basic brewing method, but no brewing method can make up for poorly ground beans.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to chat about coffee!",1,1758810483.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’m 27 and live at my mom’s because I’m trying to get a career path going and the cost of living has gotten so high in my town. 

I already have a really hard time living with my mom for basic reasons like her cleanliness/messiness and just really frustrating, nonsensical habits she has (leaving coffee bags open, leaving food out, not using the trash can and instead putting trash into paper bags, so trash stinks up the kitchen, having 5 radios and TV’s going at once throughout the day/night). I’ve brought these things up to her on so many occasions and she just doesn’t listen. She keeps doing the shit. She says I treat her like a child and I’m like “honestly mom you feel like that to me at times!!!” 

Living with her stirs up so much of the anger and upset that I buried for so long. Everyone in my family is ultra avoidant. My dad (the alcoholic) and I are the only two that keep it real in the family. My two sisters and mom act like everything was fine and refuse to talk about what went on. If I suggest my mom did anything wrong, my sisters get defensive. To me, my dad’s alcoholism/abuse/neglect - I don’t fucking care anymore because he made amends and he’s shown repeatedly that he takes accountability for what he put us through. But my mom? She will never ever take accountability for her neglect. 

My mom is a workaholic and literally my whole life has existed in front of a computer screen. She lets the world pass her by and she neglects everything around her. She procrastinates on everything. As of late, the water damage in her home has gotten worse and the ceiling looks like it’s going to cave in and I’ve found even bigger patches of black mold than I knew of years ago. I know that’s horrible and I deal with the consequences - she’s the only one I can live with here. I’ve told her so many times to get a mold specialist out here and she won’t. Now it’s getting worse. She can’t seem to understand the consequences of her negligence. 

I feel like I just never want to talk to her again and that breaks my heart because I’ve considered her my best friend. My mom is amazing in a lot of ways, but this shit is making it hard to be around her. I just want to snap at her all the time. 

I’m so angry that she’s this way, I’m so angry that no one ever taught me life skills and how to be a normal, responsible adult. I’m trying my best but it feels like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders because I’m just a fucking girl. I have no one in my life to lean on and help me and understand me and I am at my rope’s end. Life is so hard and so upsetting. ",3,1758810347.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

What the best purchase to stay as close to the $12 bucks before the membership discount (10% at the entry level) to avail the free parking you guys use? 
I’ve been going for random stuff with my coffee each morning but I don’t really like the ‘snack’ options at ITL. :/
