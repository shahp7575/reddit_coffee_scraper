I was recently in Istanbul and while touring Fener, I bought some Turkish coffee from a vendor that was flavored with Hazelnut and Cardamom. It was near the colorful stairs and right before the big hill to go to the Red School. 

Unfortunately - due to sleep deprivation, I left the bags on the public transport bus and hopefully made someone’s day. I was wondering if anyone knew what that coffee is called and if I could buy it online somewhere? I was only there for the weekend and now am back home. If not, I’m sure I’ll be back to Istanbul someday, I just wanted to get it if possible. Thank you for any help you can provide! ",1,1769970152.0,istanbul_tips,0,1.0,False

I have never had this strong palpitations. Since I work at urgent care I did ECG which was normal and we didn’t catch any extra beats. 

The doctor was not concerned at all and said it is normal to have up to few thousand extra beats and unless I am having symptoms like dizziness and syncope I should not be worried.

But I am worried and afraid it may happen again it was very scary moment.

1qt62it,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qt62it/the_art_of_flirting_with_women_what_actually/,The Art of Flirting with Women: What Actually Works (Science-Based),"Flirting is one of those skills nobody teaches you, yet everyone expects you to know. I've spent the last year deep-diving into this through books, research papers, podcasts with relationship experts, and honestly, a lot of trial and error. What I found isn't some pickup artist BS or manipulation tactics. It's about understanding human psychology, social dynamics, and why most guys get this completely wrong.

The biggest misconception? Thinking flirting is about witty lines or being someone you're not. It's not. Flirting is fundamentally about creating a safe space for mutual attraction to surface. Most advice out there focuses on ""what to say"" when the real game is about energy, timing, and reading social cues. Society doesn't help either, we're bombarded with rom-com scripts and alpha male nonsense that makes genuine connection feel like rocket science.

**Start with genuine curiosity, not an agenda.** The fastest way to kill attraction is walking up with an outcome in mind. Women can smell desperation from a mile away. Instead, approach conversations with authentic interest. Ask questions that go beyond small talk. Not ""what do you do"" but ""what's something you're genuinely excited about right now?"" This sounds simple but it's rare. Dr. Arthur Aron's research at Stony Brook University showed that asking progressively more personal questions creates intimacy faster than months of surface-level chat. The key is reciprocal vulnerability, you share a bit, she shares a bit, and suddenly you're having a real conversation instead of an interview.

**Playful teasing is your friend, but know the line.** Light teasing creates tension in a good way. It shows confidence and breaks the overly-polite barrier most people hide behind. But there's a massive difference between playful and mean. Good teasing is observational and comes from a place of liking someone. ""You seem like the type who orders the most complicated coffee drink possible"" is playful. Anything about appearance, intelligence, or insecurities? Hard pass. Esther Perel talks about this brilliantly in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" She explains that flirtation lives in the space between the known and unknown, it's about creating intrigue without making someone feel unsafe.

**Body language matters more than your words.** UCLA research found that communication is 55% body language, 38% tone, and only 7% actual words. If you're saying the right things but your body screams discomfort, you've already lost. Maintain relaxed eye contact, not staring but genuine looking. Angle your body toward her. Use open gestures. Mirror her energy, if she's leaning in, you lean in. If she's pulling back, give space. The app Ash is actually solid for practicing social awareness and understanding emotional cues if you struggle with reading body language. It's designed as a relationship coach but the modules on non-verbal communication are insanely practical.

**Compliment her choices, not just her appearance.** Every woman hears ""you're beautiful"" seventeen times a day. It barely registers. What does land? ""That's a really interesting book choice"" or ""I love how passionate you get when talking about that."" You're noticing her as a person with agency and taste, not just a pretty face. This comes from research by social psychologist Dr. Robert Cialdini, people are drawn to those who appreciate their authentic selves rather than surface-level attributes. It signals you're paying attention to who she actually is.

**Create opportunities for touch, but read the room.** Touch escalation is real but it has to be natural and consensual. Start with socially acceptable touches, a light touch on the arm when making a point, guiding her through a doorway with a hand on her lower back. Gauge her response. If she leans into it or reciprocates, that's a green light to continue. If she pulls away or seems uncomfortable, back off immediately. No questions asked. The book The Like Switch by Jack Schafer, former FBI agent, breaks down the psychology of building rapport and trust. Schafer spent his career getting criminals to trust him, the principles apply everywhere. This book made me rethink everything about how trust is built through small, consistent signals. Insanely good read if you want to understand human behavior at a fundamental level.

**Actually listen.** This sounds obvious but most people are just waiting for their turn to talk. Active listening means processing what she's saying and building on it, not just nodding while planning your next story. Reference things she mentioned earlier in the conversation. ""Wait, you said you were into ceramics, have you made anything recently?"" Women notice when you're genuinely engaged versus performing engagement. Researcher Sherry Turkle's work on conversation shows that true listening is becoming rare, which makes it incredibly valuable when someone actually does it.

For anyone looking to go deeper on relationship psychology and social dynamics but struggling to find time for all these books and research, there's an app called BeFreed that might help. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google AI experts, it pulls from resources like the books mentioned above, relationship experts, and research papers to create personalized audio content based on specific goals. Type something like ""learn to be more confident and magnetic as an introvert in dating situations"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples. The voice options are surprisingly engaging, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes the content way more listenable during commutes or at the gym. What stands out is how it tailors the material to address unique struggles rather than generic advice. Worth checking out if connecting these concepts into a clear path forward feels overwhelming.

**Know when to walk away.** Not every interaction will lead somewhere and that's fine. If she's giving one-word answers, constantly checking her phone, or explicitly saying she's not interested, take the L gracefully. ""Hey, it was nice chatting with you"" and exit. This isn't rejection of your entire being, it's just not the right moment or person. The Youtube channel Charisma on Command has great breakdowns on reading disinterest signals before they become awkward. They analyze social dynamics from movies and real interactions, makes it way easier to spot patterns.

**Confidence isn't loudness.** Quiet confidence is magnetic. It's being comfortable with silence, not needing to fill every gap with words. It's maintaining your sense of humor when things don't go perfectly. It's being okay with rejection because you know your worth isn't determined by one person's interest. This is the hardest part but also the most important. If you're not in a good place with yourself, all the techniques in the world won't help. Work on building a life you're genuinely excited about, hobbies, friendships, growth. That energy is what people are actually attracted to.

The real skill isn't learning to flirt with women, it's learning to be someone worth flirting with. That means becoming comfortable with yourself, developing genuine interests, and treating interactions as opportunities to connect rather than transactions to win. When you shift that mindset, everything else falls into place naturally.",1,1769969887.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

Requirements (must be explicit): brew multiple coffee types/sizes (≤2 min), touch UI response <1s, secure payment (≤5s), real-time maintenance alerts, temperature accuracy ±2°C per drink.

Core entities: CoffeeMachine (status, temp, ingredientLevels), UserInterface (options display + input), PaymentSystem (methods, transaction), CoffeeType (brewTime, tempRequirement, sizes), MaintenanceAlert (type/message/time), Operator (manages machines).

Relationships: Machine has 1 UI + 1 PaymentSystem; Machine supports many CoffeeTypes and emits many MaintenanceAlerts; Operator receives alerts from many machines.

APIs (keep them crisp):

1qt5wsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qt5wsf/the_psychology_of_unstoppable_productivity/,The Psychology of Unstoppable Productivity: Science Based Hacks for Lazy People,"

I spent years thinking I was just lazy. Turns out I was doing productivity completely wrong.

Like most people, I'd read all the advice about waking up at 5am, cold showers, meditation routines, and 90 minute deep work blocks. I tried them all. Failed at most. Felt worse about myself. Then I stumbled on research from Stanford's BJ Fogg and behavioral psychology that flipped everything. The best productivity systems aren't built on willpower or discipline. They're built on being smart about how lazy we actually are.

This isn't another   grind harder   post. This is about working with your brain's natural wiring instead against it.

**1. Stop trying to build discipline, start designing laziness proof systems**

Your brain literally resists effort. That's not a character flaw, it's evolutionary biology. Dr. BJ Fogg's research at Stanford shows willpower is the most unreliable resource we have. The solution? Make the right choices easier than the wrong ones.

I use something called the   2 minute rule   from James Clear's Atomic Habits. Instead of   write for an hour,   the goal becomes   open the document.   Instead of   go to the gym,   it's   put on gym clothes.   Sounds stupidly simple but this book genuinely rewired how I approach everything. Clear breaks down why tiny changes create massive results, backed by neuroscience and real case studies.

The trick is your brain can't tell the difference between starting and continuing. Once you're in gym clothes, you'll probably go. Once the document is open, you'll probably write. You're hacking your own resistance.

**2. Use   productive procrastination   instead of fighting it**

Here's something wild from research on procrastination. Fighting it makes it worse. Dr. Timothy Pychyl's work shows procrastination isn't about time management, it's about emotion management. We avoid tasks that make us feel incompetent or anxious.

So instead of forcing yourself to do the hard thing, keep a list of easier productive tasks for when your brain is in full avoidance mode. Can't write that report? Organize your files. Can't study? Clean your desk. Can't do deep work? Answer emails. You're still moving forward, just through the path of least resistance.

The app Goblin Tools is insanely good for this. It breaks overwhelming tasks into tiny steps so your brain stops screaming   this is too hard   and actually cooperates.

**3. Embrace   minimum viable effort   for consistency**

Most productivity advice assumes you have infinite energy. You don't. Some days you're running at 100%, most days you're at 60%, and some days you're at 20%. The key is having a 20% version of your goals.

Can't do a full workout? Do 5 pushups. Can't write 1000 words? Write one sentence. Can't study for 2 hours? Review one flashcard. This comes from research on habit formation, the brain cares way more about consistency than intensity.

Once I started doing   minimum viable workouts   on rough days instead of skipping entirely, I went from working out twice a month to 5 times a week. The bar was so low I couldn't fail, but I kept the habit alive.

**4. Schedule   nothing time   like it's a meeting**

This sounds backwards but hear me out. Cal Newport talks about this in Deep Work. Your brain needs genuine rest to perform. Not scrolling, not   relaxing   with Netflix, but actual nothing.

I block 30 minutes daily where I literally do nothing. Sit on the couch. Stare at the wall. Let my mind wander. Sounds boring as hell but my productivity in the hours after is noticeably better. Your brain processes information and solves problems in these gaps.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into the psychology of productivity without forcing yourself through dense textbooks, there's an app called BeFreed that's been useful. It's a smart learning platform that pulls from books like Atomic Habits, Deep Work, and behavioral science research to create personalized audio content. 

You can set specific goals like   I'm a chronic procrastinator who wants to build sustainable work habits   and it generates a custom learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. The knowledge comes from vetted books, research papers, and expert interviews in productivity and psychology. Built by Columbia University grads and former Google engineers, so the content is actually reliable. Plus you can pick different voices, I use the sarcastic one during commutes and it makes learning way less of a chore.

**5. Use temptation bundling for tasks you hate**

Yale economist Katy Milkman discovered something brilliant. Pair something you need to do with something you want to do. Only listen to your favorite podcast while doing chores. Only watch that show while on the treadmill. Only get your fancy coffee while working on the boring project.

Your brain starts associating the annoying task with the reward. Eventually the resistance drops because it's bundled with something enjoyable. I only let myself listen to the Huberman Lab podcast during meal prep and now I actually look forward to cooking.

**6. Accept that some days you'll do nothing, and that's fine**

Here's the thing nobody tells you. Even the most productive people have completely useless days. The difference is they don't spiral into self hatred and give up entirely.

Progress isn't linear. Some weeks you'll crush it. Some weeks you'll barely function. Beating yourself up about it just extends the low productivity phase because now you're depressed AND unproductive.

I keep a   done   list instead of just a to do list. At the end of rough days, I write down even tiny things I accomplished. Responded to 3 emails. Took a shower. Made lunch. This prevents the brain from catastrophizing and thinking you're a complete failure.

The app Finch is genuinely helpful for this. It's a little bird you take care of by completing small self care tasks. Sounds childish but it gamifies the basics in a way that keeps you from completely falling apart during low periods.

**7. Use implementation intentions instead of vague goals**

Research from psychologist Peter Gollwitzer shows that people who use   if then   planning are 2 3x more likely to follow through. Instead of   I'll exercise more,   it's   If it's 6pm on a weekday, then I'll go to the gym.  

Your brain loves clear triggers. It removes the decision making step that drains willpower. I have these set up for everything. If I finish breakfast, then I open my work laptop. If it's 9pm, then I put my phone in another room. If I feel overwhelmed, then I write down three things I can control.

These aren't discipline, they're just better instructions for your lazy brain.

Look, the productivity industry wants you to believe you need to become a different person. Wake up earlier, have more discipline, develop better habits through sheer force of will. That's BS. You just need to design your life around the fact that your brain is lazy and that's completely normal.

I'm still lazy. I just have systems now that make laziness work for me instead of against me. And honestly? That's way more sustainable than trying to white knuckle your way through life.",1,1769969550.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

# What Is Moltbot

Moltbot is an AI agent that actually does work.

It’s not just another chatbot — it’s a digital operator.

It connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, or Signal so you can message it directly.

But unlike typical AI tools, Moltbot doesn’t just respond — it executes.

It reads your emails.  
Creates files.  
Updates calendars.  
Runs commands.  
Even clicks buttons for you.

That means you can build systems that run parts of your business automatically.

And that’s exactly what we’re doing today — three Moltbot Automation Systems you can set up this week.



# The 4-Step Pattern Behind Every Moltbot Automation System

Before we build anything, you need the framework.

Every Moltbot Automation System follows this four-step pattern.

**Step 1: Define your goal**  
Example: Every morning, I want a summary of my leads sent to Telegram.

**Step 2: Decide the tools**  
Email, spreadsheet, calendar — what Moltbot needs access to.

**Step 3: Set the trigger**  
Time-based (every hour), event-based (new email), or command-based (you ask for it).

**Step 4: Add guardrails**  
Permissions, limits, confirmations, and logs.

You can build anything using this same structure.

Now let’s build three automations you can copy today.



# Build 1: The Moltbot Lead Machine

Most founders lose leads because they get buried in the inbox.

The Moltbot Lead Machine fixes that.

Here’s how it works.

You create a label in Gmail called Leads.

You connect Moltbot to your email — but only give it access to that one label.

Then, you tell Moltbot:

Every 30 minutes, scan the Leads label, pull out the sender’s name, company, request, and timeline. Add it to a Google Sheet and send me a summary on Telegram.

Now, every time a new inquiry arrives, Moltbot extracts the info, adds it to your spreadsheet, and sends you a clean lead report on Telegram.

Then you tell it to draft a reply:

Hey John, saw you’re interested in AI automation for your business. We help companies save 10+ hours a week with custom workflows. Want to hop on a quick call Tuesday?

You review, approve, and Moltbot sends it.

That’s a full lead-capture and follow-up system running while you sleep.



# Build 2: The Moltbot Content Pipeline System

If you’re a creator, your biggest problem isn’t ideas — it’s organization.

Moltbot can fix that too.

Create a folder called Content Dump.

Throw in everything — transcripts, PDFs, screenshots, random notes, call summaries.

Then tell Moltbot:

Every day, scan this folder, group files by topic, and create a content pipeline CSV. Include columns for topic, title, format, hook, and three key bullets.

Now Moltbot builds you a daily content system.

It clusters all your messy notes into structured ideas.

Then it sends you a morning message like this.

Here are your top 3 content ideas for today.

1. AI Automation Case Study Video
2. Lead Generation Workflow Tutorial
3. Client Success Story Thread

You pick one, record, post, and move on.

Want to go further?

Tell Moltbot:

Every Sunday, create a weekly content plan based on the best ideas from last week.

Boom — a full content calendar built automatically.



# Build 3: The Weekly Business Control Center

If you’re a founder juggling meetings, reports, and client tasks — this one’s for you.

The Weekly Control Center gives you a Monday-morning dashboard for your entire business.

You connect Moltbot to three tools.

Calendar  
Email  
Analytics or Stripe (for key metrics)

Then you tell it:

Every Monday at 8 a.m., summarize last week’s activity and this week’s plan. Include metrics, key meetings, and important emails.

Here’s what happens.

Moltbot sends a Telegram message that looks like this.

Weekly Control Center  
Past Week  
40 new members  
15 course completions  
3 support tickets resolved  
Important emails: partnership offer, client invoice, feature request  
Next Week: webinar Tuesday, content deadline Wednesday, team sync Friday.

You wake up with your entire business summarized.

You know what happened, what’s next, and what needs your attention — all before coffee.

Inside, you’ll see exactly how founders and creators are using Moltbot Automation Systems to run their inboxes, content machines, and analytics dashboards — without hiring a single employee.



# The Safety Rules of Moltbot Automation Systems

Now, let’s be real.

Moltbot is powerful — but with great power comes great responsibility.

Follow these safety rules.

Start in test mode. Don’t give it full access immediately.  
Scope permissions tightly — one folder or label at a time.  
Require confirmations for any destructive action.  
Log everything.  
Set spending caps for connected APIs.

Moltbot is like giving someone root access to your business.  
Treat it like that.

You want control — not chaos.



# Who Should Build Moltbot Automation Systems

These systems aren’t for everyone.

They’re perfect for solo founders who want a virtual employee.  
Perfect for creators who need a content machine.  
Perfect for automation builders who love connecting tools.

They’re not ideal for people who want zero configuration or companies with strict compliance.

But if you want leverage — Moltbot is your best bet.



# The Big Picture

Moltbot Automation Systems are the next stage in intelligent operations.

We’re moving from chatbots to digital operators.

These systems don’t just talk — they act.

They execute your business playbook in real time.

Lead capture, content generation, reporting — all handled by AI.

And the best part?  
Once it’s built, it never sleeps.



# How to Get Started

Pick one of the three systems.

Lead Machine  
Content Pipeline  
Control Center

Build one this week — not someday.

Then iterate.

Once it’s live, come back and comment which one you built.  
Julian reads every comment and pins the best setups.

(An anime-style, Victorian maid story)","*“19th of October, 1885” The blank page was occupied solely by this singular piece of rather untidy handwriting placed at the top right corner. What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking to GM this story, I’d love it if you contributed as well! Be it brainstorming, playing a side character from time to time, you name it. That way we both will enjoy this roleplay to the fullest (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

1qt5pb3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qt5pb3,Foreign Ration Friday - Slovakian Wet 8 Final Boss,"I finished off the Slovakian Wet 8 for brunch this morning and I'm stuffed. This is a good thing. I might take a little nap after Gurren Lagen. As you can see this was pretty plentiful with what I had left. I also added some meat sticks from Costco. They have these meat snacks in the fridge section that are pretty damn good and since they were on sale I grabbed a pack. It's either 12 or 16 sticks in the pack and they're probably 18 inches each. I had 2 left in the pack so finished those off as well. 

I'm going to start with the drinks. I had the strawberry isotonic drink and damn this was delicious. Basically an non-carbonated version of Fanta strawberry and I'm here for it. It called for 500mL of cold water and that was perfect. I would love to have more of these for daily use. 10/10 for me. Next up was the vanilla protein shake. I find vanilla to be the worst flavor for protein shakes because they mostly taste artificial. But not this one. I made it with moo milk (all protein shakes should be made with milk and not water) and had to look again when I was mixing it because it had real vanilla bean in it. It was basically like drinking melted vanilla ice cream and is 8.5/10 but mainly because it didn't mix all that well. So taking a page from Waffels I added 2 coffee sticks to it. The coffee didn't mix that well either so I added a bit of hot water and let it sit while I ate everything else. After about 15 minutes everything mixed well enough to drink. Adding that coffee made this a 9.5/10. Normally during the week I'm not a good person in the morning but will keep this in mind if I get hungry. The mixing kept it from being a 10/10. 

The beef jerky was fine. It was the tough, old school jerky of my youth that took 20 minutes to chew a piece. Good thing the slices were thin because it was a jaw workout. The flavor was pretty much like every ""original"" flavor jerky I've ever had. 7.5/10 for me. 

The cookies and cream bar was like a dry rice crispy treat. It was nothing special and had a decent Oreo knock off flavor. 6/10 for me. The coconut protein bar was meh as well. The texture reminded me of a more dense three musketeers. It had pieces of coconut but didn't have a strong coconut flavor. It was pretty weak and just a hint in the background. 6/10 for me. 

The main was crunchy granola with milk and coconut. I was going to make it with milk but the directions called for hot water and a hot cereal hot the spot this morning. Even with water this was thick and creamy and the granola still had a slight crunch even after like 10 minutes. While it didn't have a coconut flavor to it, it's still one of the best cereal mains I've had. It ranks right up there with the Norwegian chocolate muesli. If this had been chocolate...it might have unseated it. Next time I would chop up the chocolate bar that comes with the ration and add it. 10/10 for me. Absolutely fantastic main. 

Overall this was a fantastic ration and I'm happy the Slovakian government chose the Swedes to feed them. These folks know what they're doing. It's an easy 9/10 overall. Add a jam and/or nut spread and some better crackers and possibly a pâté of some sort and this would be damn near perfect. ",4,1769969115.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

I am truly excited and looking forward to what is to come, but I dont do well socially. One on one im fine, but when it comes time for coffee hour I stand in one spot, look around, then want to leave bc im not sure what to do and if im being honest, I feel like I dont deserve to be there, like I dont want to talk to people whether bc of my unworthiness or just anxiety. So I left and once I got home I just feel sad and alone. I have nothing to do, I dont know what to study, or say or anything. 
   
   I've seen others have similar experiences where I just feel like I dont know what to do or that im not going to get it? If that makes sense?

I dont want to, I just cant get over the feeling like I already failed, like anytime I send a message or ask a question im bothering, or offending, of just coming off as straight foolish. I feel like even doing the sign of the cross my timing is off, or im 'doing it wrong'.

1qt5nvp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qt5nvp,Breville / Sage to Micra - first thoughts,"After 3 years of getting into the coffee game and learning how to steam milk, dial in and so on I was finally able to convince my wife to let me upgrade to a Micra! After having set my mind on the micra for 2 years, the dream became bigger and bigger. 

  
The sage wasn’t totally bad, but the inconsisteny was really annoying. The upgrade to the Timemore as external grinder helped a lot, but due to temperature issues lighter roasts like DAKs cocobongo were not brewable so we rather stuck to cheaper and rather Italian style roasts. Also, we weren’t able to brew several coffees when friends were at ours or if we wanted to each drink a flattie for breakfast.

  
Is it worth 3334€? I don’t know. But I sure as hell love it. Great upgrade in all regards, and awesome design upgrade for the flat.

  
Now the next step is to convince the wife to upgrade our grinder to the mahkönig E64ws. 👀

  
Just wanted to share my joy, and now I will get back to learning how to steam at level 2 in under 10 seconds, compared to 30-40 seconds with the sage :D",14,1769969031.0,LaMarzocco,1,1.0,False
1qt5nfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qt5nfc/a_televangelist_healed_me_through_my_tv_part_2/,A Televangelist Healed Me Through My TV (PART 2),"I put in a request for time off at the lumberyard. A family emergency, I explained to my boss—it was the only excuse I knew he wouldn’t say no to. In the work office he told me to screw off and I wasn’t good for much anyway. I took that as a yes.



After the twenty-minute drive home, I scrounged for anything I might need and stuffed it all into a duffel bag. I didn’t want anything to do with Big Huck or his Light On High. Unless all this was a fantasy in a psych ward, there was a televangelist in Idaho with the freaky power to reach someone through their TV—and in my case, remolded my right leg like it was Play-Doh. 



Well, I wouldn’t stay around for the Big Tent. I would bunk up with my cousin in Washington State and wait for the spectacle to blow over. Quit my job at the lumberyard if I had to.



*That* sounded like a plan.



These thoughts and more flashed through my head as I packed—only for me to end up sitting on the edge of my bed, duffel bag on my lap. My eyes wandered the eggshell-white walls of my bedroom. 



I’d have to tell Connie. Never expected much of myself, but I couldn’t just vanish on the old gal without a word.



I walked around to the front yard and knocked on her door. I stood around for a good minute. Her gray Buick sat in the driveway. I knocked louder but still no answer, then tried the doorknob—it didn’t budge. I tiptoed through the flowerbeds and peered into the windows. Just an empty living room. I tapped the glass and called her name. Nothing.



I felt a ping of genuine worry. 



I called the police station for a wellness check, and in a few minutes I met with an officer on the curb. He was a lanky redhead who I might’ve recognized from high school. What followed became a whole ordeal—ending with EMTs wheeling Connie to their ambulance. She lay limp on the stretcher. They had found Connie dead on the bedroom floor. Most likely she’d suffered a heart attack or stroke during the night.    



The police officer and I walked through her upstairs apartment, sifting through papers and her belongings, looking for a clue about family or friends the station could contact. I didn’t know any—just a great-nephew, apparently.



Connie never left the house except on Sundays. Every week, she’d leave for church around 9 AM, after which she went and stocked up on groceries, then always returned to the duplex no later than noon. The officer glanced over all the grocery lists, pictures, and Dennis the Menace cutouts cluttering the fridge. “Well,” he said, “it’s not uncommon for elderly folks to stay cooped in at a certain point. As sad as it is. If it wasn’t for you, it might’ve been days or weeks before anyone found her.”



There was an oscillating fan blowing in her living room, and I noticed it had blown an envelope off the coffee table and left it on the carpet. I picked it up.



The letter was addressed to none other than On High Ministry.   



*Dear Mr. and Mrs. Hughes of On High Ministry,*



*I am writing to your program to express my gratitude. I have lived in Ponderay all my life, and it was not until your show came along that I found a true sense of peace in a world as corrupt as ours.*



*It is hard to believe at times. I had been a kindergarten teacher for just over four decades. It breaks my heart to see the same innocent children grow up to run around with nose piercings and tattoos and to know more profanities than their ABCs. How can things go so wrong?*



*A young man named Red came to have tea with me last Sunday. He is my tenant, in fact, and for all the time I have known him, Red was a slacker and a drunkard, consistently paid his rent late, and watched the most vile things on television. But who better for the Light On High to transform? I was nearly in tears when Red informed me that he had converted. If even someone like Red can embrace divinity, then there remains hope yet for people.*



*Thank you, Big Huck. Your efforts go on and have made our little corner of Idaho a better place. Praise be to the Light On High!*



*With an open heart,*



*Connie G.*



I exhaled a breath that I hadn’t realized I was holding, and put her letter back in its envelope. At this point I wished I had just stayed at work. Excusing myself, I hurried down the lawn and went inside my apartment. The day so far had hit me like a gut punch. To think that last night, just a couple feet above my head—behind a crust of sheetrock, insulation, frames and a gaudy yellow carpet—an old woman died alone while I slept. I couldn’t help but feel guilty, though for nothing I could name in particular.



After pacing for a while, I sat down and studied the envelope.



The mailing address was interesting. What I’d seen on the program was a plain P.O. box in Coeur d’Alene—yet Connie had written to a physical location. How she’d managed to uncover that bit of information was no doubt by shrewd and relentless means on her part. 



After arguing and cussing at myself, I shoved Connie’s letter into my flannel pocket and climbed into my pickup. Coeur d’Alene it was. I topped off the tank and barreled down the 95. I forced myself to act. No thinking, no hesitation—just rip the God-forsaken Band-Aid off. I had questions that needed to be answered. There was also a part of me, perhaps foolishly, that hoped Connie’s message about me—untrue as it was—would somehow pardon me from any more miracles. A little white flag I could wave.   



An hour on the road and I rolled into Coeur d’Alene, hunting for the address. It was evening now and I had to raise my hand against the sun to watch the roads. I worked my way into the outskirts of the city, then further out into the back roads and woods, until I finally discovered the place of address. It was a huge, yellow, sheet-metal warehouse on a barren stretch of asphalt—a place you’d see at a factory storehouse or local airport. Nothing else to see but chain-link fences, dirt lots and pine trees. 



I parked near the entry gate and jumped out of my pickup, moving with purpose unless I started second-guessing myself.



Besides the address numbers, there wasn’t any real sign or anything that would reveal this place to be the headquarters of On High Ministry. Just clusters of work trucks, side-by-sides and trailers occupying the compound here and there. 



With Connie’s letter in hand, I marched straight for the warehouse and its office door.   



“Hey, *you*,” came a smoker’s voice from behind me.



I turned to find a bone-thin man in a worn leather jacket. His face was sunburnt, very creased for a guy that must’ve only been forty. The first impression that came to mind was: late-night carny worker.



“You’re on private property,” he said.



“I’m looking for Huck Hughes.”



“So what. You’re still trespassing.”



“I have something for Huck,” I explained, “and I have to make sure he gets it.”



The man eyed me through his sunglasses. “You ain’t seeing him.”



“I need to give him a letter.”



“You need to go ahead and *fuck off*. Got it?”



I didn’t know what I expected to find here—certainly not this charming type of PR. I worked my jaw, holding back a surge of frustration. “No, I won’t.”



From a nearby trailer came a second man. Bigger, uglier, with cauliflower ears, walking across the asphalt in our direction. Mr-leather-jacket gave me a rotten smile. “I ain’t gonna repeat myself. Last chance to go, before Leo and I stomp you.”



“Not until I put this letter in Big Huck’s hand—”  
  


Smack. Cheap shot. I stumbled back, blinking. Then I threw my weight forward and tackled the skinny bastard to the ground. It was a blur of grunting and cursing. All I really remember was how his sunglasses snapped in two when I socked him in the temple. A boot slammed into my stomach and I rolled over, gasping. The bigger guy loomed over me. I tried to rise again but he kicked me in the chest. I lay there on the warm asphalt, flat on my back, blowing snot and blood out of my nose as I tried to suck in air.



Leather-jacket wobbled to his feet, blood streaking half of his face. “Let’s kill this asshole,” his voice cracked.



“We’re not killing anybody.”



“He hit me, Leo!”



“You hit him first. Now we gotta explain this to the big man—and I’m not getting blamed for this shit show of yours, Smiley. Dammit, man. Why do you always get so antsy?”



“Just help me get him out of here,” Smiley growled.



“All right,” Leo relented. “You take his ankles and I’ll hold him under his arms.”



“That’s his rig—the Tacoma by the gate.”



They hauled me along, for maybe thirty feet, but lowered me to the ground when another figure emerged into my hazy vision. Heap of blonde hair, jingling jewelry, a lime-green pantsuit. “What’s all this, dearies?” she asked.



Leo grumbled. “A friend of Smiley here.”



Smiley quickly shook his head. “He ran full speed at me, Mrs. Hughes. Howling and spitting and swinging at me. The kid’s probably cranked out of his mind.”



“Why, that sounds awful.” Julee Hughes leaned over me, a look of pity on her makeup-lathered face. “Did you need to rough him up so badly, Smiley?”



“For all we know,” Leo said, “this guy could be the next Tindall.”



“Did he bring a gun?” she asked.



Smiley cursed, patted me down. “No Mrs. Hughes.”



“A knife? A bomb, perhaps?”



“Ahhh… no.”



I pulled my arm free of Leo and sat up the best I could to address her, holding out Connie’s letter. It was scrunched and bloodied in my hand. “I brought… a… letter…”



“*You brought a letter*,” Julee repeated. She smiled at Leo and Smiley. “He brought us a letter, and you two went and beat him half to death. You both should know better than that. This is a ministry—not one of your whored-out biker gangs. Big Huck will be quite upset about this, you know.”



She delicately lifted the envelope from my hand.



“Is it from you?” Julee asked.



“No, uh, my landlord.”



She chuckled. “It isn’t a conviction notice, is it?”



I wiped the blood dripping from my nose. “I have to talk to Big Huck. He… he healed my leg… and I need to know why.”



“Oh my. Dearies, help this nice young man to his feet immediately.”



They grabbed me and stood me upright.



“I understand now,” Julee went on, “you’re one of the children. And you came out to see Big Huck for yourself—aren’t you a little treat. Not too uncommon either, for better or worse. We have to chase off pests every so often. Oh Huck and his shenanigans. He’s like a big cuddly magnet to people. But dear, I’m afraid that my husband isn’t here today. I do apologize for the behavior of my boys here. They’ll get a talking to. Would you like me to give Big Huck this letter for you?”



“I want to know why he healed my… my leg.”



“Well, now, it was *the Light On High* that mended your leg, not my husband.”



“They seem one and the same to me,” I said.



“Believe me dear, they’re not.”



I was at a loss for words. I didn’t know where to start or how this was supposed to end. Tears welled in my eyes. “I just… need to understand why.”



Julee Hughes frowned with an exaggerated expression, as if I was a whining puppy. She drew close and kissed my mouth, sucking my bottom lip before she let go. Blood smeared her chin, her nose. “You will, my love.”



She pulled a silk kerchief from her pocket and wiped her lips.



“Listen here. You come back this Wednesday and sit in for our next recording. I very much want to see you there. Yes? All right? I refuse no for an answer. One of my boys will give you a studio pass. What did you say your name was?”



“...Red.”



“You be good now, Red.”



Leo and Smiley turned me around and shove-walked me over to my pickup. 



Smiley ran his tongue over red teeth. “I don’t trust him,” he whispered. “Mrs. Hughes can fawn and paw all she likes—this one belongs in a ditch.”



“*Piss off*, Smiley,” Leo replied. He tucked a white slip of paper into my flannel pocket and swung the truck door open for me. “You go on and leave, kid. Git.”



I didn’t argue. I crawled into my truck and tried to orient myself in the driver seat, feeling miserable for myself. That was the last time I’d play the hero—let the mailman get his ass kicked instead. Leo and Smiley waited. I turned the key over and drove back through the fence gate. It felt like I was driving drunk—swerving and unable to keep my mind clear. As the adrenaline drained away, a fresh wave of hurt and exhaustion hit me.   



After a mile of coasting down the back roads, fiery pain leapt through my leg. I cried out, folding forward on instinct, and slammed my head into the steering wheel. The truck drifted across the pavement. Then came a heavy *thump*.



I was slumped sideways, moaning, teeth clenched as I watched a faint shimmer of light spread over my leg. Worse, there was more than pain. I felt something move inside me—like fingers moving under my skin. Feeling my thoughts, feeling over my organs and even probing at my manhood. 



When the sensation ebbed, and was gone for a time, I looked over the dashboard and found I’d rolled head-on into a concrete bin block—the only barrier in an otherwise empty pullover. The timing belt was making ugly, scraping noises. I already knew the headlights were toast. The radiator cracked and leaking. Still I cranked into reverse and my truck puttered backwards as I swerved to face the road.



I put it in park and let it idle. I’ll admit I just sat there and sobbed like a child. 



I forced myself to get a grip, and noticed a tan F-250 on the roadside down from me. An escort back home—hospitality of On High Ministry, no doubt. I watched their truck for a little too long. Leo stepped out, and sunlight glinted off a piece of chrome at his belt. I took the hint and drove.



The ride back to Ponderay was grueling, my only sense of relief was when the F-250 eventually turned off the 95 and left me.



I hadn’t eaten food in a day. The sun was already down by the time I reached Ponderay, and  without headlights I’d driven blind most of the way. I turned into the parking lot of my one-and-only gas station. Harsh neon signs stung my eyes. But I was too tired to get out of the truck, too tired to do anything, besides ease back against the seat. 



Tapping on my window pulled me awake. I blinked and saw a girl standing outside my truck. Reluctantly, I rolled down the window—then I recognized the denim jacket, and the floral tattoo on her neck, and the chunky camcorder hanging on a strap from her shoulder.



“You got your ass handed to yah,” she said.



I replied with a sort of groan noise.



“I watched it all go down—I was rooting for you, of course. Had a decent view from the woods.”



I lowered my eyes to the camcorder. “You must’ve got a good video of it.”



“If only. It was over before I could creep closer and zoom in for a proper shot. That kiss of yours, though. You bet your ass I got that on video. That’s big. Very big. Thanks a million for that.”



“You’re welcome, I guess.”



She put out her hand. I wiped dried blood on my flannel and returned a weak handshake.



“I’m Amber.”



“Hello Amber. I’m Red.”



“I recall you nearly killing me with your truck.”



“Yeah, sorry about that.”



Amber patted her camcorder. “All is forgiven, trust me.”



“How… How long was I out?”



“Oh, I let you nap for five minutes or so. You should see your face, Red—that was a hell of a beat down.”



I glanced at my rearview mirror. My face was smashed and swelling up like bread dough.



“So, Red,” Amber proceeded, “do you want me to buy you a sandwich or a Sprite or something?”



I shrugged, too exhausted to question it. A sandwich was a sandwich.



“That’s the spirit,” Amber replied, leaving for the gas station doors.



I climbed out of my truck and spat a clot of blood on the pavement. I leaned there for a moment, braced against the door, carrying the weight of everything that’d happened up until now. Too much to make sense of. I really didn’t want to chat with this chick—or anyone—but here I was, unable to say no.



I shambled into the fluorescent lights inside and sat across from Amber at one of the small deli tables. She’d bought me a Sprite and a plastic-wrapped turkey sub, plus a handful of mustard packets. I peeled open the sandwich wrap and took a bite. It tasted like blood. Forced it down anyway, then grabbed the soda and pressed the icy can against my forehead.



“Sooooo,” Amber said, gently setting down her camcorder, “you’ve met two of the On High Ministry’s stooges. Even Mrs. Hughes. *That’s nice*.”



I carried on with the turkey sub. “Hm.”



“You handed her a piece of paper. What was it?”



“A letter.”



“Written by you?”



“No—” I coughed on a bite and fresh blood ran from my nose. I smeared it off on my flannel sleeve. “It was from my landlord.”



“Intriguing,” Amber said. She swept crumbs off her side of the table. “You’re probably wondering why I wanted to speak with you.”



“I’ve already got a long list of things to wonder about.”



“Well, Red, I’ll add one more.”



Amber fished through her backpack and produced a blue piece of paper, then laid it on the deli table. It was another Tent Revival flyer—only this one was badly faded, battered, and was taped together in pieces. The event date read 1982. Wellsville, Ohio.



And there was Big Huck.



“I have one too,” I said, “but from Nebraska.”



The 93’ tent. Healing and wonders, purity, delight, etcetera etcetera.”



I pushed aside my sandwich, whatever appetite I had gone. “What is it that you want from me, Amber?”



Amber rested a hand on her camcorder. Her excitement was discouraging, her attempt to hold it back even more so. “I need you to tell me everything that’s happened. I need as much as I can get. Times, dates, events, coincidences and every heebie-jeebie you got for me.”



“You must be one of those *pests* Mrs. Hughes mentioned.”



“Oh, she’s *definitely* read my online journal by now.”



“You have a site?” I asked.



“I update it constantly,” she replied, proudly.



“Does… anyone read it?”



“Like twenty people, at least. On High Ministry is one big momma of a white whale—and I’m so close now. That love session you had with Julee Hughes is a miracle in itself. If people won’t listen about a maniac cult then they might for a run-of-the-mill adultery scandal. It’s been hot stuff ever since Lewinsky. Just imagine it: TELEVANGELIST’S WIFE has SCORNED LOVER ASSAULTED before a LAST GOODBYE KISS. Poetry, Red. Eyes are eyes and that’s what I need—whatever it takes to harpoon Big Huck.”



I stared in disbelief from across the table. “That’s bullshit—I won’t have you sending out any crap like that with my name on it. I’m not anyone’s secret lover.”



Amber gave me a shameless grin. “Well, let’s not get hung up on details for now. It’s an ongoing investigation. We can work something out. Besides, Julee seemed to enjoy it and that’s halfway there.”



“It isn’t.”



“We’re off track. You, my camcorder, evidence—how ‘bout it? I did buy you a free dinner after all. How’s your head feeling?”



I felt backed into a corner. “Why do you care so much? What’s the point of you sneaking around in the woods? Recording videos? All for twenty random people to see online?”



Her demeanor stiffened, slightly, her hand readjusting the flyer where it lay on the table. “Someone has to know,” Amber replied. 



“What do they need to know?”



“People disappear. And those people never come back. I think that’s enough of a reason.”



Well, what did I have to lose? Everything else was an abrupt dead end. Amber knew more than I did and she seemed to be the only other person in Idaho who wanted to figure out the mysteries around Big Huck. Strange bedfellows, all that.



I consented to an interview. She shot me a *I knew you would* look and had us out the door. 



Amber followed me to my apartment, keeping a block back in the dark while I parked my beaten up pickup in the driveway. Then, after further convincing, I hopped into the passenger seat of her Xterra and we pulled away. She said it was the best way to distance ourselves from any bad actors—my truck had already been seen. I didn’t like how suddenly easy it was to follow that logic.



After a ten-minute drive out of town, we reached the motel Amber was renting a room out of. It was a scuzzy place that stank of cigarettes and engine grease, with an empty pool and a half-dead neon sign that flickered *Blu-ak-n* instead of Blue Lake Inn. Insects swarmed the motel’s lone streetlight.



Amber ushered me inside and handed me a sandwich bag full of ice for my head while I waited, then hurried to set up her camcorder on a tripod.



I stood aimlessly, holding ice against my pounding head. Her room was nearly empty—laundry piles on a side desk, a travel bag, a heavy-looking laptop and a tangle of various cords. I looked at the camcorder.  



“Feels like we’re shooting a porno,” I said.



Amber replied to me with a shrug as she doubled-checked her shot through the lens. A kitchen chair had been set up in front of the camera for me. 



 “Your face looks pretty bad right now,” she told me as I took a seat, “which is perfect. Shows off what those guards did to you. You can keep the ice pack on your forehead but please don’t jostle around too much. If you don’t like talking into the camera then just look at me while you talk. All that makes sense?”



“What do I say?”



“Whatever you need to say. I’ll edit it all in post.”



Amber gave a final nod at her recording situation, satisfied with it, and then rushed off to the bathroom. She came back with a portable mirror and sat with it resting on her lap. Tapping the little plastic baggy, she laid out a line of white powder. Then Amber rolled a five-dollar bill into a straw.



“It’d be rude not to offer,” she commented, “but…”



She cleared her throat, bent down and snorted the rail. Amber raised her head again, blinking rapidly, very alert. 



“... but that was the last of it. Also, I don’t want you looking spazzed out of your mind on tape... Hhmng. Okay. *Nice*. Scooby Dooby Do. I’m ready—let’s film us a video.”



It took two hours to record. Granted, most of that was because I rambled and hit dead ends and backtracked all throughout. Amber nodded now and then, jotting down the occasional note for later. She hardly seemed surprised by anything I said. 



I just felt embarrassed, sitting there in a hotel room, being filmed like it was some kind of confession or a hostage interrogation.



There’d been a point during the recording that made me pause. It was a growing pulse in my leg, nervy and uncomfortable, like an upset funny bone. A flash of shock, guilt and dread ran over me all at once, leaving me in sweat. Amber asked what was wrong. I told her it was my leg doing it again. She jotted that down. A few moments later, the sensation fizzled out and I let out a shaky breath. Then after another half-hour or so we finished the video.



“How was that?” I asked.



Amber popped the lens cap back on. “Brilliant, that’s what it was. I’m starting to think you’re my little leprechaun at the end of the rainbow. There’s more ice in the freezer if you want.”



I stood up from the chair and began walking into the kitchen—then toppled onto the floor. Pain jolted throughout my right leg. Waves of gold light, faint and waterlike, encased my shivering leg. The pain twisted into my calf and my thigh. 



Something like an awareness, a mind, feeling over me.



A real fear of dying took hold of me.



But it passed. I lay on the cheap vinyl floor, trembling, hyperventilating, curled in on myself. If Amber had reacted or made any noise when the pain struck me down, I wouldn’t have known the difference. She crouched beside me hesitantly and ran her hand over my back. 



“Can you sit up?” she asked. 



I shook my head, but managed to do so anyway. 



“I didn’t imagine it being so brutal as all that,” Amber said. “Do I need to take you to the hospital? I thought you were going to die right here. Dang.”



She was holding the camcorder, lens cap off, red record light still glowing. 



I sighed. “I just need some sleep.”



“I got you buddy,” Amber replied, with a pat on my back. She left and came back with a square-shaped pill in her palm. “This is your best friend, right now. You can pop this and sleep all you want. I’ll let you have the bed tonight. Go ahead. Take it.”



I swallowed the tablet and stumbled into the main room, leaning on Amber before flopping on the bed. It smelled like fresh detergent. It felt like the only kindness this world had. Amber set a fresh bag of ice on my head and sat beside me for a while. I heard her pen scratching away in her notebook. 



Sunlight cut through the closed blinds of the motel room. Particles of dust shone as they sank through the thin rays. I rolled onto my side, lost for a moment, trying to remember what brought me here.



The girl from the gas station, Amber, emerged from the kitchen brushing her teeth. 



“Feeling any better?” she said.



“I can’t imagine feeling any worse.”



Amber nodded, leaned over the sink and spat toothpaste. She was in a tank top and a pair of sky blue panties. I could see her tattoo clearly too, a pattern of orange flowers spreading from her neck down past to her collarbone.



A t-shirt was thrown in my face. 



“Take a shower,” Amber said. “You got blood all over my bed.”



It was a large t-shirt, a picture of Idaho State on it and the text *Famous IDAHO POTATOES*. I got to my feet and dragged myself to the bathroom, every part of my body aching and stiff. In the motel mirror I stared back a mish-mash of purplish-black bruises on my face. I stood in the cold shower and watched dirty water swirl into the drain.



There was coffee waiting when I emerged dressed from the bathroom. I sat at the counter and drank while Amber finished getting her shoes on. She snapped her shoelaces tight and sat upright, smiling at me. 



“You sure do know how to show a girl a good time,” she said. “I put together the entire transcript last night. Typed it up and everything. Just need to load it to my site at the library.”



“A transcript from what I said last night?”



“Mhm. I will have to edit the actual video later of course—dig out a few snapshots to put on my site.” 



Amber brought over her camcorder and had me watch it replay through my collapse in the kitchen. It was like watching another person. I shook and groaned helplessly on the small screen—and spread across my leg was the gold light. 



“You see that?” she said, restraining the excitement in her voice. “That isn’t practical effects. Incredible. It’s like we’ve caught a video of Bigfoot or something like that.”



She asked if I wanted to see it again and I declined. We had our coffee, sharing the silence in between sips. 



“We should buy cigarettes,” I said.



“I agree.”



I returned to where my flannel sat on the floor and patted for the bills I had in one of the pockets. A white slip fell out. Only then I remembered what Mrs. Hughes had given me—I picked it up. 



“What’s that?” Amber asked.



“It’s an invitation to a studio recording. From Julee Hughes.”



She shot me an offended stare. “You didn’t mention that in the video.”



“I must’ve forgotten about it.”



“Oh, uh huh, right—well, when is it?”



We read it over. Wednesday at the same address, from 6:30 PM to 9 PM. Arrive fifteen minutes early. Pass required. *On High Ministry*. 



Amber tapped her finger on the slip. “We’re going, right?”



“Where’s your pass?” I said.



“*Screw you*. Just tell them I’m your girlfriend.”



I took the slip and clenched it in a fist. “Amber. I let you buy me a sandwich. I let you take me to this motel and I even let you shove that goddamn camera in my face. You saw what can happen to this miracle leg of mine—and, if it was any other person in Idaho who’d seen it, they’d be praying to God or burning sage or at least showing enough goddamn courtesy to scream. Not you, Amber. Before *I let you* do anything else, I want to know what it is that you know. I’m not about to walk into something blind—especially not into something like Big Huck.”



Amber pushed her coffee cup away and waved her hand. “Jeez, Red—it’s not that I've been keeping secrets. How else are we supposed to be partners on this? What lie have I told you?”



“Telling a lie is not the same as not telling me the truth. But both are a way of keeping secrets.”



“Take it easy,” she replied. “We’re fighting on the same side here. I’ll tell you what I know. It’s a whole day until Wednesday anyhow—I’m sure this would’ve come up in conversation. Alright?”



Her hand slid slowly over the counter and held mine. 



I hated this jello-on-a-wall game Amber was playing. God, it would be so easy to hate someone like her. I could feel her mind probing me for weak points and I hated that it seemed so easy for her to find them. 



Her fingers were soft, and their grip gently worked through mine and pulled free the white slip of paper.

***Monday…***

The next morning after their quiet vow renewal, sunlight poured through the glass walls of the Karlos headquarters in Mumbai’s BKC tower. The office buzzed with the usual Monday chaos from phones ringing, printers humming, interns darting between glass cabins like caffeinated squirrels. Karlos had shifted its HQ from the old setup in Delhi to this sleek, high-rise space at BKC months ago, and Bhagyashree still sometimes caught herself staring at the view, half-expecting the old shadows to creep back in through the floor-to-ceiling windows.She stepped off the private lift on the 18th floor, draped in a deep navy-blue saree edged with subtle pink detailing. The fabric fell clean and effortless, no unnecessary drama, just quiet authority. Her blouse was structured yet understated, sleeves hugging confidence rather than display. Hair softly styled back, minimal makeup, kohl-lined eyes sharp with focus, She looked like someone who didn’t announce power, but carried it naturally. Boss Ma’am, unmistakably.  Rishabh had left earlier as something about a pre-dawn client call but he’d left a sticky note on the coffee machine at home: “*Don’t skip breakfast, Boss Ma’am. And don’t fire anyone before 10 AM. Love, Your Husband*.” She’d rolled her eyes, but the smile had lingered all through the drive.

Now, in the open-plan workspace, her team was already gathered around the big conference table for the weekly strategy huddle. Purav was scribbling on the whiteboard, Reevu scrolling through competitor reports on her tablet, and a few junior analysts hovered with fresh printouts.

“Morning, everyone,” Bhagyashree said, sliding into her chair at the head. “Let’s start with Q4 projections. Purav?” 

Purav launched into numbers stating revenue up 18%, new client acquisitions strong, but margins tight because of the aggressive expansion into Southeast Asia. Bhagyashree listened, nodding, asking sharp questions that made the juniors sit up straighter. She was still the same Boss Ma’am: decisive, fair, terrifyingly competent.Halfway through, the glass door to the executive wing swung open. 

Rishabh walked in, blazer’s buttons opened, shirts first 2 buttons loosened just enough to look effortlessly put-together. He carried two takeaway cups from the downstairs café, One black for him, one filter Coffee with a dash of cinnamon for her.He didn’t interrupt; he just placed the cup beside her without a word, his fingers brushing hers deliberately. She felt the warmth of the coffee and the even warmer glance he gave her; private, teasing, the kind that said I remember last night without saying a word.  

Purav paused mid-sentence. “Uh… good morning, Rishabh bhai?” 

Rishabh leaned against the wall, arms crossed. “Morning. Don’t stop on my account. I’m just here to make sure my wife doesn’t bankrupt us with her brilliant ideas.”

Bhagyashree shot him a look. “Your wife is the one who keeps us profitable while you charm the clients.”

“Team effort,” he said smoothly, winking at the juniors, who tried (and failed) to hide their grins. Office romance? Officially not a secret anymore, but the nok-jhok never stopped being entertaining.

Reevu coughed. “Can we focus? We have the Singapore pitch in two days, and the deck still needs work.” 

Bhagyashree took a sip of her coffee and it was perfect, as always and turned back to the board. “Right. Rishabh, you’re leading the leading point on the client presentation. Creative team check the visuals and get ‘em locked by lunch. Purav, get legal to double-check every compliance slide. No repeats of the Jakarta fiasco and last minute mess.” 

The meeting rolled on efficiently. Rishabh stayed, contributing quietly by pointing out risks in the expansion plan, suggesting tweaks to the presentation that made everyone nod in agreement. Watching him work like this still did something to her: the same man who once plotted revenge now built their future side by side, no ego, just partnership.After the huddle broke, most people scattered to their desks. 

Rishabh lingered, leaning over her chair as she typed notes.“Missed you this morning,” he murmured low enough for only her to hear.

“You left at 5 AM,” she replied, not looking up but smiling. “I was still dreaming about your terrible attempt at making breakfast.""

“Harsh. I improved. Slightly.

”She finally glanced up, eyes sparkling. “Slightly is generous.”

He bent closer, voice dropping. “Tonight, I’ll make up for it. Dinner at home. No ordering in. And maybe… the next round after vows winking at her.

”Bhagyashree’s cheeks warmed. “We have a board call at 8.”

“After,” he promised, sniffing her hair behind her ear. 

“Always after.”  Before she could retort, her phone buzzed a message from the legal head: Naysa’s appeal hearing scheduled for next month. A new “witness” surfaced. Team prepping counter-brief.The lightness in the room dimmed just a fraction. Bhagyashree’s fingers tightened on the phone.

Rishabh saw it immediately. He straightened, all playfulness gone. “What?”

She showed him the screen. His jaw tightened, but he didn’t explode. Instead, he pulled up a chair beside her, voice steady. “We knew this might happen. She’s grasping. We have the evidence, the judgments, the truth. My team’s already in full lockdown mode.”

Bhagyashree exhaled slowly. “I know. But every time her name appears… it feels like the rain is starting again.”

He took her hand under the table, thumb tracing circles on her palm. “Then we keep the sunlight on. We work, we fight, we come home to each other.”

She noticed his thumb slow, then still, just for a second like he’d hit a memory he didn’t want to visit. She squeezed his hand back. “Together.” “Always.”

The rest of the day blurred into meetings, emails, quick corridor banter with the team. Rishabh caught her eye across the floor more than once with a raised eyebrow when she demolished a vendor on a call, a small thumbs-up after she closed a tough negotiation. Little gestures that said I see you. I’m proud. I’m here.

By evening, as the sun dipped behind the skyline, they rode the elevator down together. No one else was around. Rishabh pulled her close, forehead to hers.

“Bad day?” she asked softly.

“Best day,” he corrected. “Started with you saying yes again. Ended with you kicking ass in the boardroom. And now… going home with you.”

She laughed, light and real. “You’re cheesy today.”

“Blame the vows. They make me sentimental and romantic.”

The doors opened to the parking level. He kept her hand in his as they walked to the car.

“Shadows might knock,” she said quietly. “But they don’t get to stay.” 

“Not on our watch,” he agreed, opening the door for her.  “Now come on, Boss Ma’am. I’ve got a kitchen to conquer. And you’ve got a husband to tease about it.”

She slid in, smiling up at him. “Deal. But if you burn the oil again…” 

“I’ll blame you for distracting me,” he finished, leaning in for a quick, sweet kiss.

The drive home was quiet, comfortable. Mumbai’s evening traffic crawled, but inside the car, it was just them, the two people who’d fought through darkness, now choosing light every single day. The shadows lingered in the background, always would. But for now, the sunlight held.

***Tuesday…***

Expansion into new markets meant late nights, early mornings, and endless strategy sessions, but for Rishabh and Bhagyashree, it also meant more stolen moments amid the chaos. It was Tuesday afternoon, and the 18th-floor war room was packed. The Singapore pitch deck needed one final polish before tomorrow's virtual client meeting. 

Bhagyashree stood at the head of the long table, marker in hand, circling key slides on the projected screen.""Here emphasize the ROI projections in green. Clients love visuals that scream 'profit’,"" she said, voice firm but encouraging. 

The creative lead nodded furiously, making notes.

Purav leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. ""Bhagyashree, if we push the timeline any harder, the team's going to revolt. We've been burning midnight oil for a week straight.""

Reevu chimed in from her laptop. ""He's right. The juniors look like zombies. And you two…"" she gestured between Bhagyashree and Rishabh, who was standing near the window reviewing competitor data on his tablet ""haven't exactly been clocking out early either.""

Rishabh glanced up, smirking. ""Jealous, Reevu? We multitask better than most.""

Bhagyashree shot him a playful glare. ""Multitask? You mean to distract me every time I try to focus?"" 

The room erupted in light laughter. A junior coughed to hide a grin. The nok-jhok was legendary now and everyone knew the power couple could spar like pros one minute and finish each other's sentences the next.

Rishabh walked over, casually leaning on the table beside her. ""Admit it, My 'distractions' saved that last client presentation. You were about to go full Boss Ma'am on their pricing objections.""

She turned to him, eyebrows arched. ""And your charm offensive turned it into a love fest. Fine. Credit where due."" She poked his chest lightly. ""But next time, let me handle the hardball without you swooping in like a knight in shining Armani.""

""Deal,"" he said softly, just for her, his eyes holding hers a beat too long. 

The room pretended not to notice the spark, but Purav muttered under his breath, ""Office romance level: expert.""

Bhagyashree cleared her throat, redirecting. ""Okay, team final run-through at 6 PM. Then everyone goes home. No exceptions. We will reconvene at 8 AM sharp tomorrow.""

As people filed out to grab coffee or stretch, Rishabh stayed behind, closing the door softly. The glass walls gave them privacy without isolation although the office could see silhouettes, but not hear.

He stepped close, hands in his pockets. ""You okay? You've been quiet since that legal update yesterday.""

She sighed, leaning against the table. ""The appeal's moving forward. New 'witness' has suddenly appeared out of blue, probably fabricated, but… it drags everything back.""

Rishabh's expression darkened for a second with the shadow flickering but he pushed it down. ""My team's digging. Background checks, cross-references, the works. Naysa's playbook is old; she can't surprise us anymore."" He said it easily, too easily just like a line rehearsed long before today.

Bhagyashree looked up at him. ""I know. But sometimes I wonder if the past ever really lets go.""

He reached out, tucking a loose strand behind her ear. ""It doesn't have to.We don’t let it sit at the table."" His thumb lingered on her cheek. ""Tonight after the run-through, let's ditch the late-night emails. We have pizza and fries for dinner at home . You, me, no laptops.""

She smiled faintly. ""You? Turning off work mode?""

""For you? Always."" He leaned in, brushing a quick kiss to her forehead. ""If anything comes up… we deal with it.""

The door opened suddenly and Reevu poked her head in. ""Sorry to interrupt the moment, but the Singapore client's assistant just emailed. They want to add a sustainability angle last-minute. Deck needs tweaking.""

Bhagyashree groaned dramatically. ""Of course they do.""

Rishabh chuckled. ""See? Multitasking.""

Reevu rolled her eyes. ""You two are impossible. Come on the war room's waiting.""

The evening stretched with slides revised, arguments debated, coffee refilled. At one point, Bhagyashree caught Rishabh staring at her across the table while she explained metrics to the team. When she raised an eyebrow in question, he just mouthed, You're incredible. She felt heat rise in her cheeks but powered through.

By 7:30 PM, the deck was locked. The team dispersed with tired cheers and promises of early arrival tomorrow. 

Rishabh and Bhagyashree lingered in his cabin, gathering things.He pulled her into a hug from behind as she shut her laptop. ""Proud of you today. You led like a boss as always and still managed to look unfairly beautiful doing it.""

She turned in his arms. ""Flattery won't get you out of ordering pizza and fries, I want to have something else .""

""I wouldn't dare to  dream of anything else other than what you want."" He kissed her properly then slow, deep, the kind that made the office fade away. When they broke apart, breathless, he whispered, ""Shadows can wait. Tonight's ours.""

They left hand in hand, the elevator rode down quiet except for the soft ding of floors. Mumbai's night lights glittered outside the glass. In the car, Bhagyashree rested her head on his shoulder.

""Tomorrow might bring more noise from the past,"" she said softly.

""Then we'll handle it, Like we always do."" he replied, kissing her temple. 

She smiled into the darkness. ""Bade acche lagte hain… yeh din, yeh raat, aur tum.""

He squeezed her hand. ""Every single one.""

The shadows hovered at the edges with Naysa's appeal, old wounds, new pressures but inside their world, the light held strong. Office by day, home by night, partnership always

Translating experience. Landing the first tech role. Proving the move wasn’t a mistake.

That phase is important, but it’s not usually where careers get stuck. After entering tech, the initial urgency diminishes. Outreach shifts to regular catch-ups. Coffee meetings replace requests. Things seem stable, especially if the role appears promising on paper. *This* is often when growth starts to stall.

The conversations that guided your unconventional departure from government remain relevant. They contain insights on how roles change, where responsibilities grow, and what often becomes less complex over time. However, fostering relationships is essential for these insights to be accessible.

For those already out, when did this show up for you? Early in the first role, or later once things settled?",2,1769968925.0,formerfed,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

I know, I don’t love double digit spreads either – but this should be a blow out, friends. The Pistons get the home advantage this evening, have won 7 of their last 10 games, and have been playing great basketball. On the other side, the Nets are still shorthanded and have been abysmal to watch for most of the season; their last trip to Detroit saw them get smoked by 18 points. My money’s on the home squad to cover tonight.

* **Exploring:** We enjoy long walks, great convos, so expect nothing less but cool friendship.

We’re a chill, mostly down to earth, laid-back couple who values good vibes and great conversation. Whether you want to grab a coffee, challenge us to a board game, or just show us your favorite spot in the city, we’d be thrilled to meet up.

Turns out, I was just really bad at conversations without knowing it.

Spent the last year deep diving into social psychology research, communication studies, and books by people who've spent decades studying human interaction. also watched way too many hours of charisma breakdowns on YouTube and listened to podcasts dissecting why some people are magnetic while others clear rooms. 

Here's what actually works. No ""just be yourself"" BS.

1. Stop trying to be interesting. be interested instead

This sounds like bumper sticker advice, but the psychology behind it is wild. Robert Cialdini's research shows people associate YOU with how you make THEM feel. When you ask genuine questions and actually listen, their brain releases dopamine. They literally feel good around you, and subconsciously attribute that feeling to your personality.

The book ""Just Listen"" by Mark Goulston (FBI hostage negotiator turned psychiatrist, been on Oprah, the whole deal) breaks this down insanely well. He explains mirroring and validation techniques that make people feel heard. One trick: after someone shares something, wait 2 seconds before responding. sounds simple, but most people are just waiting for their turn to talk. That pause shows you're actually processing what they said. This is the best communication book I've ever read. period.

2. Master the curiosity loop

Your stories need gaps that make people lean in. Chris Voss talks about this in negotiation, but it applies everywhere. Instead of ""I went to Japan and it was amazing,"" try ""so I'm in Tokyo at 3 am and this old guy in a suit gestures for me to follow him down an alley..."" then pause. 

Our brains are wired to close loops. Leaving strategic gaps in your stories triggers that mechanism. The podcast ""The Art of Charm"" has an entire episode on narrative hooks (episode 836) that breaks down how comedians and TED speakers do this. been using their framework, and people actually ask me to finish stories now instead of me sensing their eyes glazing over.

3. Deploy the 70/30 rule ruthlessly

Let the other person talk 70% of the time. You talk 30%. Sounds counterintuitive, but Vanessa van Edwards from the science of people analysed thousands of hours of conversation footage. The people rated as ""most engaging"" talked LESS. They asked better questions and gave the stage to others.

But here's the key: your 30% has to be high quality. not filler. not ""yeah, totally."" actual thoughts, quick stories, or questions that go deeper. quality over quantity.

4. Be weirdly specific with details

General statements are forgettable. Specific ones stick. Instead of ""I love coffee,"" say ""I'm obsessed with this tiny place in my neighbourhood where the owner, this 70 year old italian woman, refuses to make anything with oat milk and will literally argue with you about it."" 

Specificity signals authenticity. Our brains trust details because they're harder to fabricate. This is why podcasts like ""wtf with marc maron"" are so addictive. he gets guests to share super specific memories and feelings, not press release answers.

5. Have actual opinions (not just agreeable ones)

Boring people are afraid to have a perspective. They agree with everything, contribute nothing controversial, and play it safe. But research from Stanford shows moderate disagreement actually makes conversations MORE engaging (assuming you're not being a dick about it).

The book ""Think Again"" by Adam Grant (organisational psychologist at Wharton, MacArthur Genius Grant winner) argues that intellectual humility combined with conviction is magnetic. Have strong opinions loosely held. be willing to say ""huh, never thought of it that way"" when someone changes your mind. This book will make you question everything you think you know about being interesting in conversations. insanely good read.

6. kill your filler words and dead air anxiety

ums, likes, you know... they signal insecurity and kill your credibility. The app ""orai"" gives you real-time feedback on your speech patterns. been using it for 3 months, and my filler word count dropped like 60%. 

Also, get comfortable with silence. Not every gap needs filling. Some of the most memorable conversations I've had involved comfortable pauses where both people were just thinking. Silence isn't always awkward unless you make it awkward.

7. Reference culture strategically

Have a rotation of interesting things you're consuming. Currently reading X book, watching Y show, listening to Z podcast. makes you seem curious and gives you material to discuss.

For anyone wanting to go deeper on communication psychology but finding it hard to get through dense books or research papers, there's this app called BeFreed that's been genuinely useful. It's an AI-powered learning platform built by a team from Columbia and Google that turns books, expert talks, and research into personalised audio content. 

You can set a specific goal like ""I want to become more charismatic as an introvert"", and it pulls from its database of communication books, psychology research, and expert interviews to create a custom learning plan just for you. What'ss cool is you can adjust the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. plus you can pick different voices, including this kind of smoky, conversational one that makes listening way more engaging than typical audiobook narration. makes it easier to actually absorb this stuff during commutes or workouts instead of just adding books to a list you'll never finish.

But don't be that person who makes everything about their latest obsession. reference things naturally when relevant. Nobody likes the guy who shoehorns Jordan Peterson into every conversation (no shade if you like him, just saying).

8. Develop signature stories

Comedians have bits. You need stories. not made-up ones, real experiences, but refined through repetition. Have 5 to 7 stories from your life that are well structured, funny or meaningful, and showcase your personality.

matthew dicks' book ""Storyworthy"" (5 time moth grand slam winner, TED talk with millions of views) teaches you how to find these moments in your own life and structure them properly. His ""homework for life"" exercise changed how I see daily experiences. Every mundane day has a story if you know where to look.

9. Read the room continuously

Conversational intelligence means adapting in real time. Is someone's eyes wandering? Wrap up your point. They lean in? go deeper. crossed arms and short responses? change topics or give them an exit.

The app ""Crystal"" uses personality AI to give you conversation tips based on someone's online presence. sounds creepy, but it's actually helped me adapt my communication style to different personality types. Some people want efficiency, others want warmth. One size doesn't fit all.

10. Energy management over content management

You can say the most interesting thing in the world, but if your energy is flat, nobody cares. vocal variety, hand gestures, facial expressions... they matter more than the actual words.

Rewatch some interviews with people considered great conversationalists like Conan O'Brien, Nardwuar, or Oprah. They're animated. They react. They match energy levels. It's not fake, it's intentional engagement.

The real pattern here

Most of this boils down to: make other people feel valued and interesting, have substance to contribute when it's your turn, and don't be afraid to take up space with your actual personality.

I’m sitting here in a freshly laundered hoodie, I’ve got my scent on, I literally just showered, but it fucking doesn't matter !

It’s like the internet has collective amnesia about us being actual human beings. Between those viral ""street food"" videos making everyone think we’re unhygienic and the constant ""creep"" memes on X, it feels like I’m starting every interaction from a deep, dark hole. 

You try to be friendly and you're ""desperate,"" you stay quiet and you're ""socially stunted."" There’s no middle ground when people have already decided who you are based on a TikTok trend what the fuck can I even do ?!

I’m so done with these big-name Western coaches. I tried watching a few, these guys with the perfect hairlines and the ""just be an alpha"" mantras and it’s actually insulting. They have no idea what it’s like to navigate the ""Social Scene"" not even the so called ""dating scene"" when you’re fighting 2026’s version of the ""tech-support"" stereotype or the ""pajeet"" slurs that have become mainstream again. 

They tell you to ""project abundance,"" but how do you do that when the person across from you is looking at you like you’re a service worker or a scammer?

They have no clue whatsoever about the ""hygiene tax"" we have to pay just to be seen as baseline clean, or how we’re constantly desexualized by a culture that treats us like a provider at best and a joke at worst.

It feels like trying to win a game where the rules were written for someone else entirely. 

For everyone preaching confidence, It’s not just ""confidence,"" it’s a whole different landscape of cultural landmines that most people don't even believe exist.

Watching some handsome white guy tell me to ""just be a little more confident"" literally makes my blood boil.

When I got in I said “fala português” they said “sim” then I said “Eu queira um café e um pastel” then she asked me which pastel and i realised I didn’t know a single one of them in português só ended up giving up on that, then i asked “O que você recomenda” and when she responded I realised I had no clue what she was saying so I ended up saying in English “ sorry I don’t understand can you say that in English, I don’t know Portuguese very well” then she said “ why are you speaking Portuguese then?” and I said “ I’m trying to learn the language” she seemed quite understanding after I said this and I ended up getting a espresso shot before I left she asked where I’m from and I said “Eu sou cubano, de onde você” and she said “Brasil”

1qt51j6,https://i.redd.it/rg08w6ns6xgg1.jpeg,Denali Diary from 2025 Summit,"I climbed The Tall One with a self-guided group consisting of myself and 6 other veterans last year. We spent a total of 22 days on the mountain before finally summiting in the second to last day of our permit, having spent a full week at 17 camp due to weather. We then had to descend from high damp to the airfield in a single day. I kept a daily diary in the notes app on my phone. I thought it might be of interest to this community. Some of it is in shorthand and there are some grammatical errors etc. but I figured it best to copy/paste it exactly as it was written.

Day 1: 5/20/2025

7 AM flight to Anchorage.

Nice brunch in town, stopped by James’ house,  then drive to Talkeetna. 

Checked in with TAT and dropped gear at bunkhouse. 90 climbers in the queue before us.

Rigged up sleds and packed gear

Dinner at Homestead Kitchen (halibut burger and seafood chowder, delicious!)

Live music by Roland Roberts 

Stomach ache when going to bed. Diarrhea and itch. Took Tums. Wish I’d taken Xyzal.

Day 2: 5/21/2025

7 AM breakfast at Conscious Coffee

Coffee, bagel with cream cheese

11 AM park brief 

Lunch at Fairview Inn (chicken sandwich)

Returned to pack sleds and head to TAT for weigh ins

Pack: 39

Sled bag: 75

TNF: 15

Total Weight: 129 (plus skis, skins, fuel, CMC)

Caught air taxi 1630

Decided to skip base camp, put in a cache, rigged sleds and pushed straight to camp 1. Made it into camp around 0100. Made camp, ate ramen, went to bed.

Day 3: 5/22/25 Camp 1

Woke up around 8.

Making water and eating in the tent. Weather is not bad, low wind, some clouds. Spirits high. 

Put a cache up at camp 2. 

We left around 1420. It was very hot. 

We cached everything in the ACI instead of digging a hole. 

Skied back down to camp 1. Snow not great, but views were amazing!

Got back a little before 1900. 

B&G for dinner!

Day 4: 5/23/25

Woke up a little before 8. At one point in the night I had to unzip my bag because I was so hot and sweaty.

Packed up camp and headed up.

Picked up cache at camp 2. Continued on to 10K and made camp. 

Weather was great. Was very hot most of the day when we were moving, I sweat a lot. Got very cold as we were making camp. Realized I had cached all my food except for my freeze dried meals and Mike had to loan me some snacks (watermelon sour patch kids, delicious!). Beef Stroganoff and top ramen for dinner. 

Day 5: 5/24/25

A cold morning. Clear skies and no wind. Breathtaking views! Lazily making breakfast. Dramalite leaked and woke up to a small puddle at my feet. Got most of that out, wiped the rest up with a sock. Debating today’s movement.

We decided to single carry up to 11K. Very tough. Switchbacks with sleds. Not sure I would do that again, would have been better as a double carry with a nice ski down. Made camp and enjoyed the spectacular views. Had my celebratory Charleston chew (strawberry). Beef pasta marinara and top ramen for dinner. We keep moving during the hottest part of the day, hoping to change that soon.

Day 6: 5/25/25

Woke up at 11 camp! Plan for today is to go cache at 12.5k.

I decided to take a sled. Drug it up motorcycle hill and squirrel hill unroped. We roped up at the top of squirrel hill. Raul did not have boot crampons so he stayed on skins. Made it all the way to 13.5 to cache. Hot then cold then hot then cold. Skied back down to 11 camp. Perfect timing, weather rolled in not long after we got back. Chicken and rice for dinner. Excited for rest day tomorrow.

Day 7: 5/26/25

Rest day today. We woke up to around 10” of snow. Spent the morning digging out camp. Slow, lazy day. I ate, aired out my feet, and relaxed. Sun was out most of the day. A few guys did some ski laps. Double ramen (with olive oil) for dinner.

Day 8: 5/27/25

Plan is to move up to 14K today. Woke up in a cloud and it’s lightly snowing. 

We decided to push. We debated skinning up the alternate route or booting up motorcycle hill. We decided to boot it and we all felt that was a good choice. We went straight up motorcycle hill and squirrel hill without breaking while towing sleds. Roped up at the top of squirrel hill and continued on. We bypassed our cache and went straight into camp. It was pretty cloudy but we were able to see some of the views of the Headwall and surrounding mountains. Absolutely amazing! We found a camp site that was already somewhat established and moved in. Very cold. I was wearing jacket, pants, and booties in my bag and was still cold. 

Day 9: 5/28/27

Woke up and everything inside the tent is covered in frost. We did must have not vented the tent enough. Will need to dry everything out. Definitely feeling the altitude (this is the highest I’ve slept). I have a headache and can feel some shortness of breath. Mild stomach issues too. Drank some water and took my vitamins and hopefully will feel better soon. Plan today is to recover our cache and bring it back up here to camp. 

Cache recovered. Pretty easy movement. Feels good to be fully stocked here at 14 camp. 

Derek is recovering from heat exhaustion from yesterday. His SPO2 was very low this morning. Said he’s feeling better after we got back from the cache site.

Chicken Alfredo pasta for dinner.

Day 10: 5/29/25

Woke up to -3 temps and a few inches of snow. Cloudy. Today will be a rest day. Making plans for 17 cache and looking at weather for potential summit push. 

Hung out around camp. Packed up my 17 cache bag (will probably need to redo, too much food). Took a leisurely walk around camp. Expecting a storm tonight. Very cold! Dinner tonight was a double beef top ramen. Getting into the sleeping bag at 9 PM. 

Day 11: 5/30/25

Another rest day. Took a trip to the poop crevasse. Rigged my ascender and cowtail. Repacked my food for high camp (taking much less, 4 days worth and less than normal. Each day has 1 RecPak, one ramen, 2 packets of oatmeal, ritz crackers, and some blocks and Hi-Chews. Dinner was chicken and broccoli.

Day 12: 5/31/25

High camp cache day. Ascended the Headwall. Ascender worked great on the fixed lines. There was a traffic jam since this was the first good weather day in a while. Great weather all day! The west buttress was exceptionally beautiful. Mixture of running protection and fixed lines. Made it to 17 camp and dug our cache hole (also had to make some more water). Descended and made it back to camp around 2200. We were freezing so dinner was a single ramen and hot chocolate.

Day 13: 6/1/25

Rest day. Weather was so-so. Warm and sunny for a bit when we got up around 10 AM then cloudy with light snow. Some groups are heading back down because it does not look like there will be a favorable weather window until mid-week. We scavenged some food and fuel from the departing teams to enable us to wait it out and make our attempt. Spent today resting, hydrating, and making water. Dinner tonight was beef stroganoff. Second dinner was some noodles with phad Thai noodles from the food we scavenged from departing climbers.

Day 14: 6/2/25

Weather day at 14K. High winds, low visibility, intermittent snow (mostly swirling powder that had already fallen). I stayed in the tent pretty much all day. I read Vonnegut’s Bluebeard from start to finish. I used Patty’s old Kindle that Mike gave me. We are trying to conserve food so we can wait out the weather. Dinner was a single ramen. 

Day 15: 6/3/15

It’s 10:17 AM and I just heard another guided group head back down. Still very windy. Stuck at 14 camp again for another weather day. I passed the time reading Vonnegut’s Galapagos. Dinner was Coconut Chicken Curry. I ended up with some stomach issues and had to take some Tums and Imodium. Those helped.

Day 16: 6/4/25

Plan was to move up to 17 camp today. We got all packed and ready to go, but the winds never let up, so we stayed put. Feeling a little defeated, but we will try again tomorrow. Dinner tonight was chicken and rice.

Day 17: 6/5/25

We established 17 camp today. Weather was great on the way up. Coming up with this much more weight was very tough. We recovered our cache and set up our tents. I ate my celebratory 17 camp chocolate Charleston Chew. Dinner was a double chicken ramen.

Day 18: 6/6/25

Summit attempt number 1. We started the morning with some internal fighting. We also had a hypothermia and frostbite case show up at our camp. We let her warm herself in one of our tents. When we returned from our unsuccessful summit we learned she was able to self-evacuate, but that 2 of her toes were black. We made it up to 18,740’ and turned around. It was getting too late in the day, and the winds were picking up. Later that night Nims showed up at our camp asking us for hot water. Dinner tonight was a vanilla chai RecPak and apple cinnamon oatmeal.

Day 19: 6/7/25

We had hoped to make a second summit attempt today. The weather reports promised low winds, but couldn’t have been more wrong. We have been in the tent almost all day. Austin and Nikolai went back to 14 camp to grab more food and fuel so we could wait another day or two. Monday looks to be our last shot. Kindle is dead so it’s been a pretty cold and boring day. Dinner tonight was 4 packets of maple and brown sugar oatmeal and a chocolate RecPak. Hi-Chews for desert. 

Day 20: 6/8/25

Weathered in again at 17 camp. Definitely getting stir crazy. Furious winds and light powdery snow that gets into everything. Mike found frostbite on the bottom of his right left toe. Dinner tonight was a mixture of beef ramen and rehydrated beef stroganoff. I had a sort of panic attack at night while trying to sleep. Claustrophobic in the sleeping bag with the winds blowing the tent down low to our heads. I felt like I was going a little crazy. Need to make something happen soon.

Day 21: 6/9/25

Dad’s birthday! The weather was supposed to be nice this morning. We got all ready to step by 0800 but the winds were still too high and visibility was nil. It did clear up later in the day and I got a great nap. Weather is looking even better tomorrow. Hope so, it will be our last shot at a summit attempt. Dinner tonight was a vanilla chai RecPak.

Day 22: 6/10/25

Summit attempt #2 

Winds were really bad all night again. I did not have high confidence we would be able to get far. We got ready anyway. We geared up and left camp around 10 AM. The winds had died down a little, but were still strong and cold. We started off on the Autobahn, most of which was still in the shadow. We reached Denali Pass and the winds were even colder, but we had the sun on us. We continued passed Archdeacons Tower to the Football Field where we left our packs and ropes. We climbed Pig Hill onto the summit ridge and finally to the summit. Success! We reached the summit a little after 1800. We took lots of pictures, enjoyed the incredible views, and headed back down to camp. We arrived back at camp around 10 PM making it a 12 hour summit day. Dinner tonight was a double chicken ramen and my celebratory summit mini starburst. 

Day 23: 6/11/25

Descent Day. We went from high camp at 17,000’ all the way down to the airfield on the Kahiltna glacier. It might be as hard or even harder than summit day (especially after having just done summit day yesterday). As we made our way down we picked up our caches at 14 camp, 11 camp, and camp 1. We arrived at the airfield around 0435. No dinner tonight, just some snacks along the way. 

Day 24: 6/12/25

We flew out on the first couple of planes at around 930. We got back to TAT and collected all of our gear from the storage locker and caught the shuttle back to the bunkhouse. Mike, Nikolai, Derek and I were on the first plane and got back before the others so we went to Conciois Coffee. I had a Nutella crepe and and egg sandwich bagel. The rest of the group got here and we went to the Ranger station. We were given Pro Pins for helping with the frostbite case woman at 17 camp. We went and got pizza at Highland Pizza. We for one buffalo chicken, one pep and pineapple, and one everything (30 toppings). We stopped at 7 Summits Club after and got medals, shirts, and stickers. Back to the bunkhouse then out for more food. I got ice cream, then seafood chowder with elk sloppy joe (“the Lloyd”) then more ice cream. I discovered I have some superficial frostbite on the tips of my fingers on my right hand. My pointer finger and middle finger are the worst. I think I have some frostnip on a few toes as well.

1qt4xqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1qt4xqy/please_advise/,Please Advise!,"Hi, I have been reading posts about digestive issues and the low-FODMAP diet, etc, on reddit for months and finally decided to write my own post. I am a 36 yo woman, and I am at my wit's end. I have a long story, and I promise I'll get to FODMAPs eventually.

I read the Bloated Belly Whisperer, but I feel like I still don't have answers. I have a GI appmt scheduled. I have already worked with her to look into my LPR symptoms, which I had for about 7-8 years, but have gone away in the last 6 months. Because the LPR symptoms (constant coughing and throat irritation, clearing, etc, and gag reflex being triggered in the morning by coughing so severely I'd end up vomiting) were making me miserable, we never really got to talking about the other digestive issues that have plagued me my entire life. I mean, my coworkers called me ""Coughing C\_\_\_\_"" (my name begins with C), so it was pressing. 

My GI had me on pantoprazole for quite a while, which didn't really help and I've since stopped taking it. I had an endoscopy that showed no signs of GERD damage, and an esophageal manometry test that proved my esophageal motility is normal. I did the Acid Watcher diet for a while, which also made no difference. In spite of the LPR, there is absolutely no proof that I ever suffered from excess stomach acid/GERD in the first place.

Now that the LPR symptoms have subsided, I have decided to figure out this bloating situation. As an infant/toddler, I struggled with constipation. I was prescribed kondremul, which I took for a large portion of my childhood. I would sit and strain and it was truly horrible.

As a teenager, I definitely had some dysfuntion regarding BMs. I couldn't go in the morning and then would hold it all day until I got home from school, when I could relax and find relief. After lunch, I would often have tummy aches and indigestion, and the nurse would give me a peppermint and send me back to class. I'd have to hold in farts all day. Slowly, my ability to go regularly and in the morning developed, and I rarely have had issues in that department since. I do tend to require coffee...I had a virus recently and was severely constipated the whole time. Jasmine green and peppermint tea didn't help. A week later, the first day I felt well enough to drink coffee, boom, relief. Like magic. And all this time, all my life, I essentially have NEVER had diarrhea.

My grandmother used to theorize that my digestive system was slow. I'm not sure why she would make that observation, when I wasn't even fully aware of the issue until I was in my late teens, but obviously something was always up. If I ate a large or rich meal, my heart would race and I'd feel intense pressure in my stomach, and I'd burp and burp, and I wouldn't be able to sleep until I'd vomited the majority of the meal back up. Then I could sleep. When I discovered Gas-X, it was life changing. It helped quite a bit, to the point where I would feel the pressure, but I'd be able to get enough gas released that I wouldn't necessarily have to vomit (provided I didn't wait too long after the meal to take it -- sometimes I wouldn't take it in time, and it would be a waste of a pill).

This bloating would cause noticeable distention. Often, my belly would be distended even if I didn't feel especially bloated (perhaps because I'm so used to the feeling, it only bothers me when it's really bad). This has prevented me from feeling comfortable in my skin for my entire adult life. It's why I never wear cute dresses, or even anything remotely fitted. It's why I start to get ready to go to a party or event and then get depressed looking at myself in the mirror and don't go.

It is not just fat, because it is hard and goes up and down regularly and noticeably (and even at my least distended, it is still somewhat inflated. It never truly goes away. I don't know what having a flat belly looks like). I'd like to note that I have never been truly overweight -- I have certainly been heavier, but still not what would be considered fat or even that chubby. I have recently lost quite a bit of weight (dropped from around 160, my heaviest ever, to currently around 125 lbs) and work out regularly. I am aiming for 120 at the moment. I have been a pescatarian for several years now (perhaps this has contributed to the resolution of my LPR symptoms?) and am honestly in the best shape of my life. Full disclosure, I have also tended to drink too much, though I have stopped drinking entirely for periods of time in the past couple years, which I can't say had a noticable impact on my digestive system, and I have cut back quite a bit overall.

With the weight loss, it is more apparent than ever. I can almost see my abs, but halfway between my ribcage and belly button, everything flares out and I look, as many people say, pregnant.

Since I've never had diarrhea or had to deal with racing to the bathroom, I'm certain I don't have IBS or Crohn's. Nonetheless, I decided to try the low-FODMAP diet. I have been keeping a thorough food journal since I started, and absolutely cannot determine a pattern. Suffice it to say, the low-FODMAP diet has made no difference. In fact, my bloating is just as bad if not worse (it was horrendous last night and is still extra bad as I write this and I haven't even eaten yet today). I thought if I had gastropareisis or SIBO or any of the other usual suspects that are mentioned, it would at least help a little. But the weird thing is that it would mean I've had whatever condition is causing my issues for essentially my entire life.

I was really hoping to have at least made a little progress or answered some questions before my GI appmt, but I haven't narrowed anything down yet at all. I am hoping she schedules some tests for me at least, and maybe even a gastric emptying study and/or colonoscopy (haven't had one before).

Before trying low-FODMAP, I ate healthy, and have done so for years now (lots of fruits and vegetables, very little sugar, a normal/moderate amount of fat and protein, hardly any red meat). I do not overeat. I drink SO MUCH water. I have tried lactose free, gluten free, sugar free -- all kinds of diets. Nothing seems to make a difference. I can eat the most correct meal, and still suffer. On occasion, I can eat an incorrect meal (fried foods, for example), and not suffer that much by comparison. I have made an effort to eat more slowly, and to chew my food more. I have never noticed a pattern with onions or garlic, for instance, both of which I have eaten in excess for my whole life. But I'm not eating either at all now, and, yes, I'm being very careful with seasonings/condiments/etc. I am being especially careful about fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides. And everything is still bad. What gives??? As I said, I've been a pescatarian for a few years. Now, because I can't eat most beans/legumes on the low-FODMAP diet, I have resorted to eating some lean turkey/chicken again in the meantime, in addition to fish/shellfish. After eating lean turkey yesterday, my bloating was horrible. After a dinner of steamed salmon, same thing. Is a problem digesting protein possibly involved? Gas-x helps relieve some of the pressure, but after multiple gas-xes and about a gallon of peppermint tea over the course of the day, relief was still minimal, and I was burping up until I decided to give up and just go to sleep.

When I read the Bloated Belly Whisperer, I stopped taking the digestive enzymes with probiotics in them, worried that the probiotics were adding to the problem. Now, I am not taking any pre or probiotics or digestive enzymes (and to be honest, when I was...they didn't seem to help either). I can't tell if the problem is worse now than ever, or if it's just that I'm extra focused on it.

It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I read about the possibility of it being low stomach acid. I have ordered bitters but they won't arrive for like 5 more days. I need to go buy Bragg's ACV and give that a try. I love vinegar and have always seemed to crave it my whole life. In fact, acidic foods (citrus, vinegar, wine) are all my absolute favorites, so you can imagine how bummed I was when I was doing the Acid Watcher diet. Is it possible to have craved acidic foods for this reason? Just a passing thought.

Anyway, sorry for the essay. I am going to look into scheduling an appmt with a dietician, but in the meantime...any ideas? The people in this subreddit seem well-informed, helpful, and encouraging, and like they actually want to help people figure out their problems. I appreciate any input.

1qt4vyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qt4vyk/the_psychology_of_attraction_if_these_happen_to/,"The Psychology of Attraction: If These Happen to You, You're More Attractive Than You Realize","Look, I'm gonna be real with you. Most people walk around thinking they're like a 4 or 5 when they're actually closer to a 7 or 8. And I'm not talking about some feel-good bullshit where everyone's beautiful. I'm talking about actual, measurable signs that you're way more attractive than your brain lets you believe.

I've spent months going down the rabbit hole, reading studies on attraction psychology, binging videos from experts like Matthew Hussey and Vanessa Van Edwards, and diving into books about human behavior. What I found blew my mind. There are concrete signs that scream ""you're attractive"" but most people completely miss them because they're too busy being their own worst critic.

Here's the thing. Society has wired us to think attraction is this narrow, Instagram-filtered thing. But real attraction? It's way more complex, and it involves how you make people feel, how you carry yourself, and a bunch of subtle social cues that science has actually studied the hell out of.

So if these things happen to you regularly, congrats. You're probably hot and just don't know it.

Step 1: People Get Nervous Around You

When someone stumbles over their words, avoids eye contact, or acts weirdly formal when talking to you, that's not because they think you're intimidating in a bad way. Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that attractive people trigger anxiety responses in others because people want to make a good impression.

If baristas mess up your order while smiling too much, if strangers suddenly become super polite, or if people laugh a little too hard at your mediocre jokes, your attractiveness is literally making their brain go into ""must not fuck this up"" mode.

**Try the Finch app** for tracking these social patterns. It's a self-care app that helps you notice and reflect on daily interactions. When you start logging how often people act differently around you, you'll see the pattern. It's weirdly validating and helps build genuine confidence, not the fake kind.

Step 2: Strangers Hold Eye Contact Just a Beat Too Long

Here's something most people don't realize. When someone finds you attractive, they can't help but look. But they also don't want to be creepy. So what happens? They hold eye contact for like 2-3 seconds, then quickly look away.

According to research published in Psychological Science, we subconsciously stare longer at faces we find attractive. If you catch people looking at you, then quickly glancing away when you notice, or if they keep sneaking glances, that's your attractiveness doing its thing.

Also, notice if people's pupils dilate when they look at you. Sounds weird but it's real. Dilated pupils are an automatic response to seeing something appealing. You won't catch this every time, but in good lighting, it's noticeable.

Step 3: People Mirror Your Body Language

This one's subtle but powerful. When you cross your arms, they cross theirs. When you lean in, they lean in. When you touch your face, suddenly they're touching theirs. This is called mirroring, and it's one of the most researched indicators of attraction and rapport.

Social psychologist Amy Cuddy talks about this in her work on body language. When someone finds you attractive or wants to connect with you, their brain automatically copies your movements. It's subconscious. They're literally syncing up with you.

**Read ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer**, a former FBI agent who breaks down the science of influence and attraction. This book will make you question everything you think you know about why people like you. It's based on years of behavioral research and actual interrogation techniques.

If you want to go deeper but don't have the energy to tackle dense psychology books, **BeFreed** is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google experts that turns books like ""The Like Switch,"" research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. 

You can type in something like ""I want to understand attraction psychology and improve my social confidence as an introvert"" and it'll pull from dating experts, behavioral research, and real success stories to create a custom learning plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. Plus you get a virtual coach that answers questions mid-episode. The voice options are legitimately addictive, there's this smoky, conversational style that makes learning feel less like work and more like listening to a friend who actually knows their stuff.

Step 4: Your Friends' Partners Act Differently Around You

Okay, this sounds messy but hear me out. If your friends' boyfriends or girlfriends are either weirdly competitive with you or super nice to you, that's often because they see you as a threat level they need to manage.

They might make subtle digs about your appearance, or they might go overboard complimenting you to stay on your good side. Both reactions come from the same place, they recognize your attractiveness and they're insecure about it.

Psychologist Robert Cialdini talks about social proof in his book ""Influence."" When you're attractive, people treat you like a commodity that needs to be either neutralized or befriended. Your friend's partner acting weird? That's your attractiveness creating social tension without you doing anything.

Step 5: People Remember Random Details About You

Do people bring up something you mentioned in passing three weeks ago? Do they remember your coffee order or that story about your weird uncle? When someone finds you attractive, their brain goes into hyperfocus mode about you.

Studies from the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology show we have better memory recall for information about people we find attractive. It's evolutionary. Our brains are wired to remember details about potential mates.

If someone remembers that tiny detail you barely remember sharing, they're attracted to you. Their brain literally filed you under ""important person, save all data.""

Step 6: You Get Unsolicited Help and Favors

Does the guy at the grocery store offer to carry your bags without asking? Does someone always volunteer to help you move? Do coworkers go out of their way to assist you with stuff?

This is the halo effect on steroids. Research from the University of Buffalo shows attractive people receive more help, more leniency, and more favors. People's brains associate your attractiveness with goodness, and they want to be near that energy.

**Check out Vanessa Van Edwards' YouTube channel**, specifically her videos on charisma and attraction signals. She breaks down peer-reviewed research into bite sized insights that'll make you see social interactions completely differently. Her content is gold for understanding the science behind why people act weird around attractive folks.

Step 7: Your Social Media Engagement is Quietly High

Not talking about being Instagram famous. But notice if your posts get likes from people who rarely engage with others? Or if someone who barely posts suddenly comments on your stuff?

According to research on social media psychology, attractive people get disproportionate engagement even with mediocre content. If your basic photo of coffee gets 50 likes while your friend's objectively better photo gets 10, that's not random.

Step 8: People Get Protective or Possessive

Friends warn you about people's intentions constantly. People assume you're taken. Someone always wants to introduce you to their single friend. This happens because attractive people are perceived as valuable, and people want to either protect that value or claim it.

Step 9: You Get Job Opportunities You're Not Quite Qualified For

Harsh truth backed by science. Studies published in Applied Psychology show attractive people get hired more often, get paid more, and get promoted faster. If you've gotten interviews for jobs where you barely met the qualifications, your attractiveness probably opened that door.

This isn't fair, but it's real. And recognizing it isn't arrogance, it's understanding how the world works.

Step 10: People Assume You're Confident Even When You're Not

Do people describe you as confident when internally you're a mess? That's because attractiveness and confidence get conflated in people's brains. Research shows we assume attractive people are more confident, competent, and together.

If people treat you like you have your shit together when you definitely don't, your attractiveness is creating that illusion. Their brain is filling in gaps with positive assumptions.

The point of all this isn't to make you cocky. It's to stop you from underselling yourself because your brain's been lying to you. These signals are happening whether you notice them or not. The science is clear. If multiple things on this list resonate, you're more attractive than you think.

Stop waiting for permission to believe it. The evidence is literally in how people treat you every single day.

How much should I expect for this? I'd love to have a cutout for a knockbox and wiring/plumbing to go through.

As for dimensions, I'd say maybe a 8-10 foot length bar.

1qt4o4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1qt4o4f/i_feel_like_a_bad_partner/,I feel like a bad partner.,"TW: attempted school violence mention

My partner and I both have physical and mental disabilities. I am the ""work horse,"" my partner is unable to get a job due to disability making her need to call off constantly. 

Being the work horse is fucking hard. I am in pain and tired all the time, plus I feel like I can barely understand what is going on around me. Then I come home and have to manage the household. I am definitely taking on a larger mental load as of now. 

This is going to sound SO silly, but my first cup of coffee in the morning is my pillar. I brew it on the stove top, and have a homemade mix that I add to it, as well as milk. I have my coffee the exact same each morning. Yesterday morning, I discovered there was no milk left because the night before, my partner had used all of it for cereal. I tried putting cream in it, but it made my stomach go sour.

Then I found out that on Friday they had found a loaded gun in a students bag at the school I worked at. They found it on accident, they had been searching his bag for something else and hey oops look at that! A gun! Wow! Two years ago a different school I worked at had a bombing attempt so I am like super not feeling good things rn. 

I tried to go about my day, but my partner has fallen really behind on her chores (loading dishwasher and doing laundry) due to malaise and her OCD tormenting her. She has giant bags under her eyes every day and is often fully mute right now. It has been driving me a little crazy to see her like this. There is nothing I can really do but try to be supportive.

My weekend routine is folding laundry and meal prepping, which I could not do because there were no clean dishes or laundry. Everything else on my to-do list couldn't happen until she got up, so I am stuck sort of sitting and waiting. I knew I could do her chores, but then I wouldn't have any energy left to prepare us for the upcoming week, which would mean me missing meals, which cannot happen if I am to be the proper workhorse. 

4pm hits and she is still in her room. She knows the plans for the day, but she is stuck in her room. I feel an intense wave of conflicting emotions because I know she is doing her best. Each week she is doing a little bit better. She has a lot going on in her mind and in her world, and her body has been feeling really weak. On the other hand, I am going through just as much, AND working, AND managing the household, AND taking care of her. Plus, I am feeling lonely because she is (rightfully) focusing her energy on herself and getting herself out of this dark pit. 

I tried to chill tf out. I meditated, journaled, made art, watched positive stuff, but instead of it making me feel better it just sort of twisted my stomach up more. 

So, of course, I snap. She comes down and I offload everything onto her. She then reveals how she feels like I have been mad at her for a while and she was worried that our relationship was in danger (it never was) which of course makes me feel even more mixed up. She says she has been walking on eggshells around me which is awful to hear but I honestly can see her side. 

I cannot properly summarize what all she does do for the household, but she is definitely a valuable part. She helps me keep my head on straight, she is the only one who can drive and takes that responsibility very seriously, and she makes sure the bills all get paid on time. I need her to be able to do everything I do in a day, but right now she is struggling and I just keep making it worse.

So, if you're looking for another ""hey"" or a penpal for vague small talk, I'm probably not your guy. But if you're looking for something genuine with a clear direction and the consistency to match the ambition, then you're exactly who I'm hoping is reading this.

I'm in a great chapter of my life, I'm steady, growing, and genuinely happy. The only thing that would make it better is sharing it with the right person.

**So please, only reach out if you are intentional about finding the one you want to spend your life with and confident we might match after reading my post.**  


**A bit about me**

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'm confident in my looks (Pictures are available right away - just ask). I finished my bachelors a while ago and now I work in public administration.

In my free time, I'm into

* Reading (Mostly classics and fantasy novels) 
* Artsy stuff (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos or refurnishing my room like I do at the moment)
* Cooking (Still suck at handling slabs of meat, but I´m getting there)
* Gaming (would love to play some co-op together) 
* Binge-watching movies and shows
* Fitness (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* Traveling (Next vacation is gonna be next month, yay)
* Self-care (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself in general)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.



**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, consistency and intentionality right from the start. When we like each other, we act like it.

I believe something special happens in a romantic partnership, where it becomes the primary place for that deep, vulnerable connection. I'm looking to build that kind of close, singular bond with my person.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability and dependability
* Emotional health and availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity and good, direct communication
* A nurturing side with gentle humor and playful teasing

I value and need those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.



**Little dreams about us**

I'm not just looking for a plus-one for my existing plans, I'm looking for someone to make new ones with. My big dream is a partnership that feels like an adventure and a sanctuary in one. There are so many things I want to experience with you, especially when it comes to traveling:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together and the same through rural Japan
* And lots of trips together in general, since I travel about 3 times a year and would love for you to accompany me

But for me the foundation to something fullfilling is in the quieter daily moments like cozy weeknights where we recharge, make new experiences together on weekends, and the relaxation of cuddling up in bed together, especially in winter. I want a love that's as intentional in its daily rhythm as it is in its long-term plans.



**Closing Note**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. As I said, life has been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that the right person is missing (You!). Like the title implies, I'd prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but I'm open to connections from anywhere in the EU as long as you are intentional and upfront. Meeting shouldn´t feel like a big step at all to me. For me it´s a basic and natural step.

A quick hello with your age and where you're from is a perfect start when you decide to reach out. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions! (Also, I text a lot less formally in private, but I thought it´d be best if I polished this post up haha)

I'll be honest: I'm selective. I turn down the majority of conversations early because I can tell they aren't leading to the kind of connection I've described above. My hope is that by being clear about what I'm looking for, I attract someone who's looking for the same thing and knows she's it.

To everyone reading this, whether you reach out or not, I'm wishing you the coziest sunday evening and hope you're well, wherever you are :) I'll be looking for your message",2,1769966755.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I spent THREE YEARS doing Duolingo every single day. Never missed a day. Had that green owl threatening me and everything. I could ace the lessons, recognize tons of vocabulary, even understand movies with subtitles.

Then I went to order coffee in Spanish. Completely froze. Pointed at the menu like I'd never studied a day in my life.

Anyone else been there? That crushing moment when you realize you've been ""learning"" but not actually... learning?

# What I figured out (the hard way)

The problem isn't that apps are useless. It's that **they teach you ABOUT a language without teaching you to USE it.**

It's like learning to swim by reading about swimming. Eventually you gotta get in the water.

For me, the breakthrough was stupidly simple: I started having actual conversations with a real person. Not pre-recorded lessons. Not chatbots. A human who could:

* Correct me in real-time (not 3 days later with a red X)
* Focus on MY specific weak spots (turned out my pronunciation was trash)
* Keep me accountable (hard to skip when someone's waiting)

Within 30 days I had my first REAL conversation. Not scripted. Not memorized phrases. Actual back-and-forth where I understood and responded naturally.

8 months later I'm taking business calls in Spanish. Still not perfect, but fluent enough to actually use it.

# Question for you all:

**How long have YOU been ""learning"" a language? Can you actually have a conversation in it?**

I'm genuinely curious if other people hit this same wall or if I'm just terrible at self-study lol.

**JULIAN.** I'm savin' my love for you.



**KELLY.**  You should be saving your back for work tomorrow.



**JULIAN.** That is tomorrow’s problem. Today’s Julian only wants to bask in joy.



**KELLY.**  You could be taking more time off to bask— but you’d rather run off right away to be a stinky zookeeper. I don’t know why you didn’t tell them you needed another week before you could start.



**JULIAN.** And pass up another day at my dream job? The animals need me! The stink needs me! Hard work is (*overlapped by KELLY)* good for the soul–



**KELLY.** (*rolling her eyes; overlapping JULIAN*) Hard work is good for the soul— you’re turning more and more into your parents.



**JULIAN.** And we have a mortgage now. (*As if he doesn’t believe it himself, gesturing to the forest around them*) For all of this! 



**KELLY.** (*In disbelief*) All of this…



**JULIAN.** *And* this way I can leave all of the unpacking to you!



**KELLY.** Oh, you think you’re sneaky?



**JULIAN.** I know I am.



**KELLY.** We’ll see how sneaky you feel when you come home to all of your things in the yard.



**JULIAN.** (*laughing*) There’s plenty of space for it!



**KELLY.** Maybe I’ll even set you up your own tent to stay in — Buddy and I can have the whole house to ourselves. 



**JULIAN.** No, no, that’s okay. I’ll help finish unpacking this weekend. You have Buddy locked up?



**KELLY.** In his crate and fed. 



**JULIAN.** How did he seem?



**KELLY.** Kind of anxious. He would not stop barking.



**JULIAN.** Poor guy. I’m sure he’ll adjust. He spent most of his life locked up in an apartment, and now he’s got– all this. It feels like a whole new world. Did you give him any–



**KELLY.** Sleep juice, yeah–



**JULIAN.** –Gabopentin– 



 **KELLY.** He’s dozing off now. 



**JULIAN.** (*Nodding*) He’s a sweet, old dog. Hopefully he won’t need it for very long. 



**KELLY.** Well, I’m sure it won’t help that his dad is leaving him tomorrow. 



**JULIAN.** Think he’ll be the only one that will miss me?



**KELLY.** I could think of a couple other people.



**JULIAN.** Oh yeah?



**KELLY.** Like the mailman. 



**JULIAN.** The mailman?



**KELLY.** Yeah. Or the propane delivery person. They’ll be heartbroken that you aren’t here.



**JULIAN.** Well, maybe I’ll swing by during lunch.



**KELLY.** Don’t be silly, that’s too far.



**JULIAN.** No, no– I insist–



**KELLY.** You’ll just be coming here and back.



**JULIAN.** Yeah, well — I hate to think of the *mail man*, out here all by himself. Besides, I’ll have a few minutes to chat. 



**KELLY.** Oh– *just* to chat?



**JULIAN.** Well, I guess I would have enough time for a quick screw in the yard.



**KELLY.** Julian! In the yard?



**JULIAN.** That trip to the bedroom wastes precious time– you said it yourself, I’ll only have a few minutes to stop by.



**KELLY.** Sounds pretty risky.



**JULIAN.** (*Looking around*) There’s no one else around for miles. Who’s going to see– the mail man?



(*They laugh. Beat. Julian and Kelly look into each other’s eyes lovingly*.)



**KELLY.** Come on! The rest of this crap isn’t going to unpack itself! And your lover, the mailman, isn’t going to help you.



(*Kelly runs off stage in the direction of their moving truck, Julian following close behind.*)



**JULIAN.** Hey— come on! Leave some for me! 

  


(*The lights dim.*)

  
  
  


**SCENE TWO**



*The next day. Knocking is heard as the lights rise. Kelly answers the front door.* 



**KELLY.** (*Peaking her head out*) Hello? Anyone there? (*She steps out onto the porch.*) Julian? (*Beat.*) Mail man? Huh. Must have been the trees– hi neighbors. (*She gives the trees a stilted wave and a faux-cheesey smile.*) No– yeah, yeah. We’re still unpacking. (*Beat*.) Well, no, it’s good to meet you! Everyone in the neighborhood seems so friendly– and no HOA, that was a big plus for us! (*She gives a fake laugh*.) Well, I’ll be seeing you around the neighborhood, Mr. Oak. Ms. Maple. I should really run out for some groceries– you know how it is when you first move. It’s just pizza, pizza, pizza until you want to scream. Aaack!  Yeah! Oh, what’s that? (*Beat*.) Game night this Friday? Well, we’ll see how unpacking is coming along, but— no, yeah, I appreciate the invite! Maybe next time! Okay, well, I’ll be seeing you around, neighbor. Bye! Bye-bye…. Buh-bye! (*Beat.*) What total bitches.  (*Kelly leans in through the front door to grab a set of keys.*) Alright Buddy, I’m off to the store. You be good, while I’m gone! (*She closes the door, locks it, and trots to her car offstage. The car starts and pulls down a gravel road. The lights begin to dim, and the knocking resumes, loud and incessant. Blackout.*)

  
  
  


**SCENE THREE**

*Night. The sound of dog barks fade into the distance. Kelly and Julian step out from inside with flashlights.* 



**KELLY.** Buddy! (*She whistles.*) Come here, boy!



**JULIAN.** Buddy! Buddy! Where did you run off to guy?



**KELLY.** Buddy! Oh God, where did he go? 



**JULIAN.** You said he just ran out the door?



**KELLY.** When I was bringing in the groceries. He bolted. 



**JULIAN.** That's so unlike him.



**KELLY.** I know – I – I'm sorry. I didn't think to close the door behind me.



**JULIAN.** No, no– it's not your fault. He's never done this before.



**KELLY.** Buddy! Come home, baby!



**JULIAN.** He's probably still excited from the move. 



**KELLY.** Buddy! (*She whistles.*) Come here boy!



**JULIAN.** Maybe he smelled a fox or something out here. I'm sure he'll come back once he's run off some energy.



**KELLY.** I don't want him to be out here alone all night. I feel terrible. 



(*Julian goes to comfort her.*)



**JULIAN.** He'll be okay. It'll be okay. Let's keep looking.



(*The lights fade as the two continue their search, calling out Buddy’s name. Beat. A distorted dog’s howl echoes from somewhere in the distance.*)

  
  
  


**SCENE FOUR**



*Early evening. Julian is returning home from work. Car doors slam and he enters from offstage, humming to himself. He walks halfway to the porch and suddenly stops, staring out into the forest.* 



**JULIAN.** Buddy? Is that you?



(*Julian whistles and steps towards the forest. Beat.  Kelly peaks her head out of the front door.*)



**KELLY.** Julian? What are you doing?



**JULIAN.** I thought I saw– there must have been something rustling around… I thought it might have been Buddy.



(*Beat.*)



**KELLY.**  Come inside, we can look for him again after dinner…



**JULIAN.** Yeah….yeah, alright…



(*The two go inside. From the forest, the same whistle Julian used is mimicked by The Voice. The lights dim.*)

  
  
  
  


**SCENE FIVE**



(*Kelly and Julian stand facing away from each other. Ethereal music plays.*)



**JULIAN & KELLY.** I had a dream last night. 



**KELLY.** It had to have been a dream. There's no way it— It couldn't have been real…



**JULIAN.** It felt real. 



**JULIAN & KELLY.** I was lying awake in bed.



**JULIAN.** Kelly was sound asleep, but I was just tossing and turning. 



**KELLY.** Julian was snoring. I checked the time and it was just after midnight. He usually stops after a few minutes–



**JULIAN & KELLY.**  so I thought that I would step out onto the porch for some fresh air.  



**JULIAN.** I took a glass of water and a flashlight and my binoculars with me. It was almost three in the morning, and I thought that I might be able to get a look at the barred owl that hunts in this area.  



**KELLY.** I like the nights here. Looking up at the clear night sky, listening to the crickets… it's so peaceful… and then I realized that it had gotten so incredibly still…



**JULIAN & KELLY.** I was dreaming.



**KELLY.** Right? I had to have been. Because there was– when I realized how quiet it had become, I– he was there. 



**JULIAN & KELLY.** Buddy was there. 



**KELLY.** Walking out of the forest, coming back home after disappearing for almost a week… as if he had never left. As if he had been there at the treeline, just waiting for me to open the front door for him. 



**JULIAN.** I saw him just past the treeline. But it wasn't Buddy. 



**KELLY.** I cried out and ran up to him and threw my arms around him in a big bear hug. He smelled like he had been rolling around in something dead, but I didn't care. I buried my face in his fur and cried and asked, where did you go? Where have you been? We looked everywhere, we looked so hard for you. 



**JULIAN.** The way he moved wasn't right. It wasn't anything… natural. 



**KELLY.** I pulled away from him and started looking him over. I was trying to see if he was okay, if he was hurt or– I– I remember looking into his eyes. His eyes were… different somehow. Almost human, but not. 



**JULIAN & KELLY.** I told myself I must be dreaming. 



**JULIAN.** When he walked, it was as if… as if he were – the way an octopus moves. How it stretches a tentacle out, delicate, intentional, and longer than it looks like it should be able to go. It stretches long and thin, and you can see up against the glass every little sucker pulsate as the muscles engage. That's what Buddy reminded me of. 



**KELLY.** I looked him over and cried over him – ‘Buddy, Buddy, where did you go? Where were you, we looked so hard for you, we searched all over.’ Buddy looked me right in the eyes and spoke. 



**VOICE.** (*A distorted pastiche of Julian and Kelly's voices*) Hard work is good for the soul. 



**KELLY.** It was as if he understood the question, but not the answer. 



**JULIAN & KELLY.** I told myself I must be dreaming. 



**JULIAN.** So I said –what the hell. If this really is a dream, I might as well play with my dog again. I called out for him and ran towards the forest. I turned my flashlight on and shone it through the trees and…



**KELLY.** I backed up away from him. He just sat there, staring at me with… those eyes… Until I was back in the house. 



**JULIAN.** I-I shone the light and… He smiled at me… Long and wide and impossibly thin— as if it might stretch right off of his face… and… and then…



**KELLY.** And when I woke up, I was in my own bed the next morning. 



**JULIAN.** I cried out and …It jumped. But, that's not… He- he jumped out of his own skin. 



**KELLY.** Just a weird dream. 



**JULIAN.** One moment he's there and the next… part of him is speeding away in the darkness in a blur. And the part of him that's still there is just… deflating…



**KELLY.** (*Overlapping*) It had to have been a dream. 



**JULIAN.** (*Overlapping*) It was real. 



**KELLY.** I didn't– I mean why would I even bother? Telling Julian about some freaky dream about– I'm probably just feeling guilty. That’s all. There's no need to bother him. 



**JULIAN.**  When I checked the forest the next morning, I found a mound of fur right where Buddy, or it, or – it was right there, right where it had been left. I sound like I'm– like I'm losing it. I don't even know how I would begin to tell Kelly… I don’t know… 



(*Blackout*.)

  
  
  


**SCENE SIX**



*The next evening. Julian is returning home from work. As he walks towards the front door he hears The Voice.*



**THE VOICE.** (*In a perfect imitation of Kelly’s voice*.) Julian… Julian…



**JULIAN.** Kelly? What are you doing out there?



**THE VOICE.** Julian! Come here boy!



**JULIAN.** Where are you? What are you doing out in the woods?



(*Julian takes a few steps towards the treeline. As he is about to step into the forest, Kelly steps out onto the parch.*)



**KELLY.** Julian? Are you coming inside?



**JULIAN.** What– what are you doing over there?



**KELLY.** What are you talking about?



**JULIAN.** It’s… nothing. I just thought I, uhm… It’s nothing.



**KELLY.** Okay… Well, are you coming in?



**JULIAN.** Yeah… yeah, come on…



(*The two enter the house as the lights begin to dim.)*



**THE VOICE.** Julian… Julian… Julian…

  
  


**SCENE SEVEN**



*Morning. The lights rise on Julian and Kelly sitting on the front porch silently drinking coffee. There is a long silence.* 



**JULIAN.** So…



**KELLY.** Sleep okay?



**JULIAN.** Not really.



**KELLY.** Can’t really say that I did either…



**JULIAN.** Oh? Everything okay?



**KELLY.** Yeah, I think I just… (*She finishes the last of her coffee.*) I need more coffee. You want some more?



**JULIAN.** Maybe in a minute, yeah. Just… just sit here with me for a minute. (*Julian rests his head against Kelly’s shoulder*.) I just want to be with you… for another minute. Is that okay?



**KELLY.** That’s okay. I like being out here with you. It’s so… peaceful. 



**JULIAN.** I like being with you too— anywhere. Not just– Not just here. I’d be happy with you anywhere. I was happy in our apartment.



**KELLY.** That tiny little rathole?



**JULIAN.** (*Shrugging*) It was our rathole. And at least there, we were the ratkeepers. 



**KELLY.** What does that even mean?



**JULIAN.** I’m just– I wonder what’s keeping us here?



**KELLY.** You actually want to move back into the city?



**JULIAN.** I… no. I guess not… I think I’m just tired. I miss Buddy.



**KELLY.** I know. I miss him too. He’ll come back.



**JULIAN.** What if he doesn’t?



**KELLY.** Don’t say that… He’s out there, somewhere.



**JULIAN.** I don’t know… where could he be?



**KELLY.** He’s out there… running and playing and living it up with the forest animals. He’s having the time of his life… I’m sure of it.



**JULIAN.** Yeah… Maybe. I just want you to hold me.



**KELLY.** It’ll be okay.



**JULIAN.** I know. Just hold me.



(*The two sit in silence for a beat. The sounds of the morning gradually fade away into the sounds of night, as the lights dim and Kelly exits, leaving Julian alone on stage.*)

  
  


**SCENE EIGHT**



*Nighttime. A chorus of crickets and frogs chirp. Julian sits at the porch steps, staring into the forest. Beat. The sounds of the wildlife come to a halt. There is an ominous stillness.*



**JULIAN.** I know you’re there. The other creatures give you dead away, and— I didn’t know it at first. What that feeling was. But that prickle on my skin. That pit in my stomach. I can’t ignore it now because I know you’re there. Watching. I realized the moment I first saw you face-to-face– or… That wasn’t you own face, was it? Whatever. How long have you been watching. I wonder what you’re waiting for? (*Beat*.) Do you even understand me. I know… I know what you — I come face to face with them all day, every day. Predators. Even when they’re caged up, you can just feel it coming off of the animals, the way their eyes follow you, ready to pounce. I see them. See it all the time at the zoo. Even where you’re the one taking care of them, even when you’re feeding them, they still track you with… those… hungry eyes. The same eyes… What are you hunting for, why haven't you pounced yet?



**THE VOICE.** (*Testing this new word*) Z-z-zoooo. Zoo. Zoooo. 



**JULIAN.** Yeah, that’s right.



**THE VOICE.** I see… at zoooooo.



**JULIAN.** Yeah, it’s all the same. It’s a zoo out here too, only difference is the cage is bigger. That right?



**THE VOICE.** That right? That right? That right?



**JULIAN.** Which one of us is the animal though?



**THE VOICE.** I know you’re there.



**JULIAN.** You know– the first time I laid eyes on you, I was– I thought of an octopus. The way they scuttle around and— they can mimic too. Their bodies, at least. I admit– I don’t know what an octopus is supposed to sound like. Your vocalizations– that’s more like, like a parrot. Just repeating sounds you hear, but… that’s like a socialization thing. In the wild, different flocks can distinguish between each other’s calls. Of course… We cage them up and teach them how to– to ask for crackers. I guess — I think I just want to understand you. I need to know. I– I work with animals, and I think that if I can just understand your behavior–

**THE VOICE.** I want to understand your behavior.



**JULIAN.** Do you even know what you’re saying?



**THE VOICE.** Zoo–zooo….. yes.



**JULIAN.** What?



**THE VOICE.** Understand… watching to understand…



**JULIAN.** Talk to me. What are you?



**THE VOICE.** (*Perfectly imitating Julian’s voice*) I can leave all of the unpacking to you…



**JULIAN.** That was from–! Have you been here this whole time?



**THE VOICE.** I wonder what’s keeping us here?



**JULIAN.** What–! You little devil, what are—



**THE VOICE.** (*Perfectly mimicking Julian from the top of the show*) Ain’t misbehavin’, I’m saving all my—



**JULIAN.** Shut up! What the fuck did you do to my dog? What are you? What are you! Come out and show me–



(*The stage goes black. A dog’s bark can be heard, loud and aggressive. Julian screams. Beat. The lights rise and Julian is gone.*)



**THE VOICE.** Zoooooo…. What are you? What are you? Z-z-z-zoooooooo. 



(*The Voice repeats as it grows quiet in the distance, dwindling until all is silent again. After a moment, the crickets resume their chirping.*)

  


**SCENE NINE**



*Late evening the next day. Kelly sits on the porch, haggard. The woodland creatures suddenly go silent. Julian emerges from the forest. Throughout the scene, his mannerisms are unnatural. He blinks seldomly, closing one eyelid at a time when he does. He moves stiffly, as if he might teeter over at any minute. His voice slips into strange, growling inflections Julian would never use.* 



**KELLY.** Julian? Julian! Jesus— fuck– where the hell have you been?



**JULIAN.** (*blankly*) Out there.



**KELLY.** What do you– were you just wandering around out there all night? Jesus Christ, I’ve been talking to the police all day, you made me worried sick! What the hell were you doing out there?



**JULIAN.** I don’t remember…



**KELLY.** Oh my god, oh my god— ok, just stay there, I’m going to call you an ambulance, you’re freaking me out. Jesus, you stink! What the hell happened to you— (As she speaks, *Kelly takes out her phone and dials*.) Yes– hello? I’m at 100 Birch Drive, I need an ambulance or a paramedic, or-or… it’s my husband, he’s— he’s been missing and he suddenly walked out of the forest and…. No, no I don’t know. He just walked out and, he’s– he can’t remember what happened or anything. Yeah, okay. Thank you. (*She hangs up the phone*.) Just sit down, Julian. 



**JULIAN.** I’m okay. 



**KELLY.** You don’t remember anything at all?



**JULIAN.** I remember…. 



**KELLY.**  What? 



**JULIAN.** I remember the forest.



**KELLY.** Yeah–okay… why don’t you sit? You’re a little close…



**JULIAN.** I remember watching… through the leaves. 



**KELLY.** Julian, you’re freaking me out. Jesus, don’t get so– just sit down, okay? 



**JULIAN.** I have been watching for so long.



**KELLY.** Okay, well it’s time to sit down for so long.



**JULIAN.** So long…



**KELLY.** Hey– hey, look at me… you’re going to be alright, look at… Julian? What’s wrong with — what happened to your eyes?



**JULIAN.** Eyes?



**KELLY.** They’re… so dark…



**JULIAN.** That’s okay. Just sit.



**KELLY.**  I’m not– you should– what happened to you!



**JULIAN.** I remember… what is it– that it is all just a zoo.



**KELLY.** Julian—



**JULIAN.**  Which one of us is the animal?



**KELLY.** Seriously, you’re freaking me out. What are you even talking about? Why are you acting like this?



**JULIAN.** Am I acting wrong?



**KELLY.** Yes!



**JULIAN.** I tried so hard. It is much more difficult than it looks… I don’t understand… why you have to blink so much.



**KELLY.** What? Julian– stop creeping over me like that, just– just sit down. Give me some space!



**JULIAN.** I thought you liked him close to you…



**KELLY.** Julian!



**JULIAN.** Like thisssss….



**KELLY.** What… What happened to you?



**JULIAN.** (*imitating Kelly*) What happened to you?



(*Ambulance sirens are heard in the distance.*)



**KELLY.** What the fuck are— the ambulance is almost here, Julian. You’re going to be okay…



**JULIAN.** More practice… need more practice to get it right. 



**KELLY.** Just stay there! Don’t– it’s going to be okay. You’re just– just having some kind of an episode or–



**JULIAN.** Next time, I’ll get it right. 



**KELLY.** What the fuck did you do–



**JULIAN.** See you around.



(*Julain gives a wide, maniacal smile. Beat. He sprints offstage into the woods.*)



**KELLY.** Julian! Julian!



(*Blackout*.)

  


**SCENE TEN**



*Some time later. Lights rise on Kelly carrying moving boxes out of the house and offstage, back and forth, back and forth. She pauses for a moment, staring out into the forest. After a moment, the voice in the forest can be heard singing– soft and distant, nearly a perfect imitation of Julian at this point.*



**VOICE.** No one to talk with, all by myself, No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf, ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you…



*As the verse is being sung, Kelly takes a steps towards the forest, a step away, and finally crumbles to the ground weeping. The lights dim to black. Curtain.*

two weeks ago, we went to buffalo wild wings after work because our team hit some quarterly target and management gave us a $50 gift card to split between 9 people. dan had 4 yuenglings which is apparently his villain origin story threshold

he leans over to me and goes “can i tell you something fucked up” and i’m thinking okay he’s gonna tell me he’s got a crush on the woman in accounting or he’s secretly a furry or something manageable

no

this man tells me that back in april our boss kevin took credit for this whole warehouse routing system dan spent 3 months building. presented it to the vp and used the word “spearheaded.” did not mention dan and he had to sit in that meeting and smile

so one night dan stayed late. hd told everyone he had to “finish up some reports.” and rubbed his bare ass on kevin’s yeti tumbler rim with the cowboys sticker on it. its the one i fear kevin brings every single day and rinses out but never actually washes 💀💀

dan said he only did it once but then he also said “i think about it every time kevin talks down to me in standups” and honestly i respect it but also i’m in hell now. because now every morning i watch kevin drink his celsius mixed with protein powder from that mug and talk about “accountability” and i just have to sit there. dan is completely normal while kevin is completely unaware. i’m the only one serving a sentence here

yesterday kevin said “dan’s really been a team player lately” and i almost bit through my tongue

It was rough with how things turned out before the year ended but still I got better. I feel like I'm still grieving my dad's passing and his 1 year death anniversary was just yesterday.

I don't feel like I'm grieving still and I believe I already moved on but I do realize and notice that I'm less happier or jovial as I used to. I'm not as cheerful or happy when it comes to dealing with clients. I usually just go straight to business but still yielding some good. I thought of myself as someone with lots of empathy which is why I succeed but now I don't feel it as much anymore. 

I'm at that mode when the days are just automated but I don't seem to accomplish tasks at work now that I got promoted and will be doing a different set of tasks soon at a different location so I'm more nonchalant or just don't give a shit. Im still not happy. 

I remember what it looked like though. My eyes looked different 5 years ago and prior. I stopped and smelled the lilacs in the morning. I had coffee outside and enjoyed the sun. I played in the snow a little and marveled at how it all looks even when I was in my early 30s. Jesus I would romanticize me making breakfast even if it was just eggs and turkey bacon. I don't know what happened.

I miss my old self and I don't know if there's a way to bring that person back. Outdoor therapy? Working out? Moving to a different town? Getting a car to drive around?

1qt48s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1qt48s3/arfid_and_lack_of_taste/,ARFID and lack of taste,"To give context I have felt like this since a child and am wondering if this is part of ARFID. I have foods that I absolutely wouldn’t touch but I have found that all food tastes the same. I derive no joy whatsoever from food. It is very confusing to explain. Sometimes the first bite- after that nothing. I’ve always described it as feeling like I am eating cardboard. Alongside that my anxiety is EXTREME in prepping food, after having prepped, I feel exhausted and it NEVER tastes the way it’s supposed to taste. I had a test from my dietician for a quick overnight oats prep for extra protein- well - it took me forever, I felt like I was touching and smelling all these different things and so confused and yup one spoon this morning- it was the most digusting thing I have ever tasted. Now I have the ingredients in my cupboard. I feel like I cannot do this. Now I am 41 years old. I have been in hospital for AN, with no understanding of how ARFID also plays into it and I have reached the point where I have requested to go back to a permanent feeding tube option. We have discussed it before and then they sent me home on seed. But I’m willing to take in the calories, I just cannot manage the stress and the taste and the thoughts constantly of it being off etc. it’s not ideal, it’s not anything in that but it’s going to keep me alive essentially which I would like if anyone would just listen to me. I am tired of this now. I’m sorry if this is triggering but I am so distressed that I have reached the point of wanted to completely stop eating and drinking altogether if it meant this would end. Ironically it seems that is easier than looking for a way to help me live and focus on the things I love without being consumed, agitated and sick by food. I love my iced coffee, I eat pizza, I will eat a dry chicken strip/breast but I also find myself having to stuff in too much at once to try get it over and done with which leads to me feeling sick and nauseas.

There is no taste. I hate everything - imagine i could get all my needs with being able to have one bite before my brain completely shuts off my tastebud’s. Is this normal- is there something else at play here.

1qt47z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelebratingIndia/comments/1qt47z6/magha_pournami_how_my_childhood_beach_ritual_is/,Magha Pournami: How my childhood beach ritual is actually a biological reset (and why we need to keep it clean),"In my childhood every year without missing i went to the beach initially with family members. Later with my friends. There are lakhs of people from all the near by areas came and taking the bath as a part of tradition. Actually I didn't know anything about why to take bath, but still I am doing because normal days very less times usually going to beach, then very few people. But this special day even the beach cannot be visible properly that much of crowd there. I am really wondering about how people are actively participating, especially old age and elders. I think it's the beauty of Indian traditions. There are other sides also during this day, people using shampoos etc and leave the plastic and other waste. That will pollute the sea in some way. So, if these things also people aware and take care along with the traditions, it will add much more.. I read something regarding this tradition i want to share.

It is fascinating how these childhood memories of crowded beaches and family rituals actually hide some very practical human science. When you think about it, the tradition of Magha Pournami is basically an ancient way of hitting a giant reset button on our bodies. Even if we did not know the reasons as kids, our bodies were definitely feeling the effects of that early morning dip.

The most immediate thing that happens is a massive wake-up call for your circulation. Stepping into cold water before sunrise forces your heart to work harder and your blood to move faster to keep your organs warm. It is like a natural high-intensity workout for your veins. This helps shake off the sluggishness that usually builds up during the colder months, making you feel more alert and alive than a cup of coffee ever could.

There is also a huge benefit to our internal clocks. Since we are biological beings, our brains need clear signals to know when to be awake and when to sleep. By being at the beach and watching the sun come up right after that cold shock, we are resetting our circadian rhythms. This helps balance our hormones, leading to better focus during the day and much better sleep at night. It is essentially a way of syncing our human biology back up with the natural world.

Even the air at the beach plays a role. That mist and moving water create negative ions which, when inhaled, help boost our mood and lower stress. It explains why even with such massive crowds, there is a certain sense of peace and clarity that comes over people. It is a shared human experience that builds a strong sense of community, which is likely why even the elders find the strength to participate every single year.

However, there is a contradiction here. We seek purity for ourselves in the water, but we often leave behind plastic and chemical shampoos that pollute the very source of our healing. If we want to truly honor this tradition, we have to remember that we are part of nature, not separate from it. Protecting the sea is just as important as the bath itself. It is about showing the same respect to the environment that we are asking it to show to our health.",2,1769965975.0,CelebratingIndia,0,1.0,False

1qt47ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/1qt47ea/hypersomnia_and_missed_out_on_life/,Hypersomnia and Missed Out On Life,"When I was young, 15 year old and younger, I used to joke if a tank rolled over the end of my bed I'd still be asleep.  It feels like that was ten minutes ago, but it is in reality decades.

As the years went by sleep became a problem, starting after I got a hiatal hernia. Sleep apnea studies measured at 120 apneas.  I think the hypopneas were actually what defeated the CPAP solution.  I've had way too many lab sleep tests.  Only about 4 of the tests in my opinion revealed anything useful, each after a new significant device or medication.

The first thing that helped was a dental appliance.  Eventually I got an Inspire device installed, feeling desperate and thought that was the only remaining solution.  My Inspire device does not hold steady, which the Inspire people said it should do.  On my last visit to a pulmonologist he realized I need to make sure the Inspire is on when I'm taking Xywav.

One of the pulmonologists explained low oxygen causes weight gain, which sure happened to me.  One or more of my medications in the past couple of years caused me to lose 80 lbs.  

When I was young and sleeping better I only sometimes remembered any dreams.  Wind forward in time, somewhere over 20 years, and after getting tested for sleep apnea I realized I wasn't remembering my dreams because, waking up twice a minute I wasn't having any dreams, never reaching that level of sleep.

I've been taking Solriamfetol (generic for Sunosi) that helps me wake up in the morning.  I take the Solriamfetol and after an hour or two drink a large cup of coffee to get reasonably awake.  Coffee and Solriamfetol, taken too close together, causes me to have bad hand tremors.

I told the pulmonology doctor I was tired ALL the time, leading to an MSLT test, which showed I definitely had Idiopathic Hypersomnia.

At that time I started Xywav.  I think I've been on Xywav for over a year now, but time passes so fast for me I rarely get the passing of time correct.

I have a similar experience to other Xywav users, where I have intense dreams that go around, and around, and around.  The dream isn't particularly bad, but it's like I get bored with a repeating dream.  Can't move on.  Hours of the same dream.

Another problem I have is the side effects of Xywav, which vary drastically with the dose.   Too much Xywav causes me to sweat so bad I'm laying in a puddle and wake up, and very thirsty.  I'm grateful I don't have some of the worse side effects.

I, ""sleep"" for about 3 hours per dose, and automatically wake up.  Near the 3 hour mark I feel very tired but can't sleep.  The second dose gets me back to sleep.  I wake up early in the morning plenty tired, can't sleep more, and I get out of bed.

The IH aggravates my overwhelmed feeling because some days I can't get much productive done.  The worst part is the, ""Idonwanna"" times, where I want to get some task completed, but just can't even start.

It's extremely helpful to know other people have the same problems with Idiopathic Hypersomnia even though I don't see any magic solutions.  I'm a, ""realist"" (pessimist) who wishes some day I won't have to wake up in the middle of the night for a dose of medicine, only to wake up tired in the morning.

I sure wish there were measurements that could help design the correct solution customized per person to improve their specific sleep problems.  

I'm somewhat depressed for having missed life, and have anxiety problems from not being able to address all the challenges I face.

Good wishes to everyone with sleep problems.  I hope everyone can find a solution that gets them at, or as close as they can, to a good night of sleep and a completely awake day.",3,1769965940.0,idiopathichypersomnia,2,1.0,False

1qt474u,https://i.redd.it/auxo5aw41xgg1.jpeg,So You Want to Get Into Vintage Romance Books: A Guide to Collecting for Newbies (From a Newbie),"Hello friend, are you getting a little weary of the same old plots and cookie-cutter characters? Heard the word “mine” growled a few too many times? AI generated slop got you down? Well, welcome to the guaranteed AI-free world of vintage romance! But first, a point of clarification: am I saying that vintage romances are “better” than most new releases? Yes, I am. But also, no. There’s plenty of trash in the ocean!



I started fumbling around in the world of vintage romances a little over a year ago, and it has blossomed into an obsession. This is an attempt to distill down some of the things I’ve learned, and to pass this knowledge on to you if you’ve been vintage romance curious.



First and foremost: your collection should be fun and interesting to **you**. Books don't have to be rare and expensive to be interesting to collect. It doesn't have to be an exercise in building an “expensive” collection. Find a niche and allow yourself to be weird! My collection is very scatterbrained right now, but I’ve already started niching down as I’ve become a more seasoned collector. I have a healthy collection of Mary Balogh’s Signet Regency Romances, a bunch of 80s and 90s Fantasy Romances, some early “Futuristic” (Sci-fi) Romances, and then some problematic old bodice rippers with banging covers that I suffer through for your enjoyment. But I also have some Paranormal Urban Fantasy Romance from the early 2000s (I’m *so* sorry I called that time period “vintage”), and other random books I grabbed because I love the covers.



So here’s my attempt at distilling down what I’ve learned so far to help you get started. A lot of what I learned comes from [Rebecca Romney](https://www.rebeccaromney.com/), a rare book dealer who built a lovely collection of vintage romances.



**Choose Your Weapon (Vintage Romance Formats):**



* **Mass Market Paperbacks:** The pocket rockets of the 20th Century publishing world, these are the most plentiful option. They were sold everywhere from bookstores to gas stations. They were designed to be cheap and portable, but they were not built to last. The paper is thin and prone to yellowing, and there’s a chance that they will disintegrate into dust if you crack the spine.
* **Category Romances:** These are your Harlequins, Silhouettes, and Dell Candlelights. They are shorter (usually under 200 pages), trope-driven, and tend to be released in numbered monthly batches. These are your comfort reads, you tend to know exactly what you’re getting from the title. They are really easy and fun to collect because you can just “fill in the numbers”.
* **Hardcovers & Trade Paperbacks:** Collectors of these, I salute you. These fuckers are heavy and take up tons of shelf-space. The trade-off is they are more durable and make better “trophies”.



**Vintage Romance Anatomy:**



From here on out I will be focusing on my fave, the mass market paperback. The most critical feature for me, as a magpie collector, is the cover art. Vintage romance publishers spared no expense on the cover art. The classic clinch cover, the lovers in a passionate embrace, is why I’m slowly drowning in these dusty old books. The other thing to look for is the stepback! Sometimes publishers went for a discreet cover, with just the title and author and maybe some flowers, and they hid the horny art inside on a second cover page. Usually there’s a little stripe of colour showing on the outside to let you know there’s a tasty little easter egg hiding in there. And sometimes the publishers were like “fuck it, we ball” and you get both a clinch cover **and** a stepback. Friends, we were living.



**Problematic Content & Diversity:**



Alright, let’s be real: cracking open a book from 1978 can sometimes feel like a game of Minesweeper. You’re ticking along enjoying a lush description of a windswept moor, and then *bam!*, you step on something that explodes in your face. Game Over.



Vintage romance is often a product of its time. You will encounter “forced seduction” and straight up rape, extreme power dynamics, racism, sexism, and other backwards social views. It’s okay to acknowledge that these elements are trash while appreciating other aspects of the book. I view them as a “cultural time capsule”, and it’s also interesting to see how the genre has progressed. I collect them for the art and the audacity, but I always have a modern palate cleanser on my nightstand while I’m reading one for a reason!



While vintage romance is a sea of white, heteronormative stories, and big publishers certainly gatekept the hell out of the industry (and we can talk about how much has changed… or hasn’t), diversity did exist back in the day. There were lines of Black category romances in the 80s, and Gay & Lesbian “pulp” stories were published by small independent publishers. Hunting for diverse vintage titles is an advanced level of collecting, but very worthwhile from a cultural preservation perspective.



**Where to Find Them:**



* **Thrift Stores:** General thrift stores are my go-to for finding vintage books. This is where you are most likely to hit “paydirt” in terms of finding a rare or valuable book for cheap. They receive a bunch and throw them on the shelves without any research, all for the same low price. Now, I love the thrill of the chase, a random “big” find is enough to give me a months-long high that nothing has come close to replicating. However, if you are on the hunt for a specific title, you are likely to be waiting a long, long, *long* time before you find it. Hot tip for bodice ripper hunters: small town church-affiliated charity thrift stores are all absolutely rotten with old bodice rippers. Church ladies loved that shit, and their embarrassed grandchildren likely dumped grandma’s old panty steamers off when she moved into a retirement home while trying not to think about it too hard.
* **Used Book Stores:** These will offer a bigger variety of books, and the staff can often help you find what you’re looking for, but the prices will generally be a little higher than at general thrift stores. They may have some rarer books, but they are also more likely to know what they have and price accordingly.
* **Online:** Places like Ebay, Thriftbooks, and Abe Books are great if you are on the hunt for something specific, but expect to pay much higher prices here. I definitely have started using them to fill in little pockets of my more niche collections, but I set rules for myself about how much I’m willing to spend.



**A Note About Online Pricing:**



Beware of Bookjacking! This is a new thing I learned about when I accidentally created a price surge for [Sea Treasure by Johanna Hailey.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1qlqs53/its_cold_the_world_is_on_fire_and_everything_kind/) If you look for a copy now, you’ll notice that this book is listed for absolutely ridiculous prices. Please, do not buy this book for hundreds of dollars on my account! It was good, but not that good. What’s happening here is a phenomenon called bookjacking. Less scrupulous online sellers have noticed a big uptick in searches for this book, and have created a fake listing. You’ll notice, if you search, that all the listings for Sea Treasure are using the same single photograph. They don’t actually have the book, but they’ve listed it for a massively inflated price hoping that someone will be desperate enough to buy it. Then, they’ll look for the book at a much more reasonable price and essentially drop ship it to the buyer, pocketing the massive difference.



If you are going to buy a rare, valuable book online, be cautious and make sure it’s a genuine listing. They should at least have photographs of the book from multiple angles, and close-ups of any damage.



**What Makes a Vintage Romance Valuable?:**



The glut of romance available on the market makes people think that individual titles aren't valuable, but this is far from the truth. The most valuable vintage romances usually hit these major points:

1. A First Edition - The first edition printing of a popular book will usually fetch a higher price.
2. Out Of Print - If you can no longer buy the book by any other means, this will drive the price up by a lot.
3. A Rare Cover - A lot of older books have been reissued multiple times with updated covers, which makes some covers more valuable than others.



You’ll notice that most of the “heavy hitters” in the vintage romance collecting world hit all three points.



**Storing Your Collection:**



The best thing about books is that you don’t need to be overly precious about them. Books are designed to be handled, and they are a bit like people: they don’t want to be stuck in a damp basement or in a hot attic for years. Keeping them in your living room or bedroom on a bookshelf, and periodically taking them out and leafing through them is good for them. As long as your hands are clean and dry, and you don’t jam the spine open, dogear the pages, or put your coffee cup on top of them, you won’t damage your books.



A note about mold: I’ve been lucky enough to not have much of a problem with mold. Mold on books is pretty easy to spot. If the pages look a little water damaged, and if the book smells a little funky, this is a sign to check it over. Mold can be almost any colour and looks like fuzzy hair or raised spots. What I do see a lot of is foxing, which is not mold. Foxing is your book aging naturally but not-so-gracefully. They are yellow or rusty brown splotches that are caused by iron impurities in the paper. These spots are harmless and you don’t need to worry about them!



Alright, I think that’s everything. So go out and have fun, and, most importantly, post pictures of what you find here so we can enjoy them too!

Hi everyone, first time in Europe here, although I'm kind of a seasoned traveler (M, 38yo, 7 countries).

Following the tradition of aiming higher than possible, I'd like to squeeze 4 European cities in my first time in that part of the world, with a budget of 7∼7.5K USD. I'm planning to visit during the Spring:

**Paris - Amsterdam - Rome - Dublin**

Fortunately, I'm not the main-attraction kind of guy, but really spend the day just walking on the street, people watching, walking in and out of coffees, book stores, gardens and a (possibly free) museum here and there. Nonetheless, I keep reading about all kinds of budgets for food... which is a meta-worry in my travel plan, since I'm not eating any bread or sugar in my current diet plan and I don't know if this is going to limit my dining options.

Right now, my USD budget looks like this:

* 2,000 for Flights (1500 to cross the Atlantic and 500 within Europe)
* 2,700 for ABBs (4 nights in Amsterdam, 7 in the rest)
* 2,000 for Per Diem food & drinks (mostly water, beer sometimes)
* 350 for Activities (a possibly free museum here and there, 2 day tours in Dublin)
* 500 for Transportation (if needed, since I use walking / bike / public transport)

Notice there's no budget for shopping, since I already have too much junk at home. If any, maybe cough up a couple hundred bucks for a jacket at a thrift shop, stuff like that.

**So, the main questions:** Is this budget realistic? What should I look for in restaurants in order to know it's not shady and it's not fancy? How much should I expect to spend at those places? is it tiresome to do these four different countries (cities) in a short time?",1,1769965891.0,u_captnpraxis,0,1.0,False

This is a weekly roundup of board game crowdfunding projects, featuring new launches from the past week and campaigns ending in the coming week. The information is sourced from Kickstarter, Gamefound, and Backerkit.

The list is curated through a combination of automated data collection and manual review, so occasional errors or omissions may occur. If you notice a missing project, feel free to mention it in the comments. Only projects meeting the selection criteria outlined below are included.

## Other channels
Other than Reddit, you can also find this list on the following platforms:

- [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DU2QU3G5Xe-YwT9sbx4gBjGd8WEcjHd4KZBDMosaPIw)
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@danielpervan)
- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/danielpervan.bsky.social)

## Selection Criteria

Projects must meet the following conditions to be included:

1. **Timing:** The project was either launched in the last week or will end in the coming week.
2. **Relevance:** The project is directly related to board games.
    - Excludes: Accessories not strongly related to board games, furniture, RPGs (e.g., D&D, Pathfinder), video games, STLs, painting tools, events, podcasts, and magazines.
    - Exception: Projects offering promos or similar content for board games are eligible.
3. **Backers:** The project is expected to reach at least 100 backers by the end of the campaign.
4. **Funding Status:**
    - The project is expected to reach at least 90% of its funding goal.
    - The project has already achieved at least 20% of its funding goal.

In addition to the main lists, I include a separate section for noteworthy projects that don’t strictly qualify as board games. These projects are included based on a single criterion:

1. **Backers:** The project currently has more than 1,000 backers.

## Crowdfunding is not a store

Crowdfunding is not a guarantee. Projects may face delays, incur additional shipping costs, or fail to deliver entirely. Creators are not obligated to fulfill their promises. While many excellent games are funded this way, the risks are real—only back projects with money you can afford to lose.

Be wary of creators who use [FoMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) (Fear of Missing Out) tactics to drive pledges. Don’t let the pressure get to you. If you miss a campaign, there will always be others. There's no shortage of excellent board games to enjoy.

## Tags
Each project is tagged with one or more of the following categories:

- 🌱 Creator's First Project
- 🌳 Creator with more than 5 projects
- 🌟 Featured Project (e.g. Kickstarter ""Staff Pick"")
- 💰 Fully funded
- 🔥 More than 200 daily backers
- 🤝 Offers refunds (e.g. [Stable Pledge](https://help.gamefound.com/article/250-what-is-stable-pledge))

1qt4554,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalProductEmpir/comments/1qt4554/the_price_psychology_that_took_me_18_months_to/,The Price Psychology That Took Me 18 Months to Understand ($5 vs $27 vs $99),"Most beginners think higher price = more money.

That’s wrong.

For almost a year, my cheapest product made more than my “premium” ones.

Not because it was better.

Because I priced it correctly for Reddit psychology.




**The Mistake I Made in My First Year**


When I started selling digital products, I did what everyone does:

I tried to “look professional”.

So I priced my first guide at $49.

Then $79.

Then even $99.

Result?

• Traffic: decent
• Profile clicks: good
• Sales: terrible

People read my posts. They trusted me. Then… they didn’t buy.

I blamed my copy. My funnel. My design.

It wasn’t any of that.

It was the price.




**What I Eventually Noticed (After Watching 400+ Buyers)**


After tracking behavior for months, a pattern appeared:

$5–$9 → Impulse zone
$20–$35 → Trust zone
$80+ → Proof zone

Each range attracts a different buyer mindset.

Most sellers ignore this.



**$5–$9: The “No Thinking” Zone**

My $6 PDF:

• Price: $6
• Avg weekly sales: \~200
• Weekly revenue: \~$1,200

Why?

At $6, people don’t analyze.

They think: “Worst case, I lose coffee money.”

No comparison. No hesitation. No overthinking.

It’s a friction killer.




**$20–$35: The “Do I Trust This Guy?” Zone**


My $27 playbook:

• Price: $27
• Conversion rate: \~6–8%
• Weekly revenue: \~$800+

Here, psychology changes.

Buyers ask:

• Is he legit? • Has he done this himself? • Is this practical?

They’re not buying information.

They’re buying credibility.

Your Reddit history matters here more than your sales page.





**$80–$99: The “Show Me Proof” Zone**


My $99 product:

• Traffic: high
• Sales: low
• Support: heavy

At this level, Reddit users want:

Screenshots
Case studies
Reputation
Time in community

If you don’t have that?

Price becomes a blocker.

Not a signal of quality.




**The Lie Most Gurus Sell You**


“Just charge more and you’ll make more.”

No.

On Reddit:

High price without social proof = invisible product.

Low price + trust = scalable income.




**My Current Pricing Framework**


Now I price intentionally:

Entry product: $5–$9
Core product: $20–$30
Advanced: Only after reputation

Each level has a job.

Not “maximize profit”. Maximize momentum.


**Why This Works on Reddit (Not Instagram)**

Reddit users are:

• Skeptical • Pattern-aware • Anti-hype

They don’t buy “brands”.

They buy systems.

Pricing is part of that system.




**The Real Lesson**


Pricing is not math.

It’s psychology.

You’re not selling PDFs.

You’re selling risk reduction.

Every dollar increases perceived risk.

Your job is to control it.


If you want to see how I structure products + pricing step by step, it’s in my profile.

No hype. Just systems that compound.

In particular, I LOVE coffee and tea, but have been told I'll need to not have them for as long as I use it and I'm not sure I can do that/it's going to be really hard, so trying to learn about it more first/hear from others in a similar situation to me.

Some of my friends have said they use the whitening strips and drink coffee and tea normally and have been fine, but I was wondering about other people's experiences especially with this product? If you drank coffee/tea normally throughout, has it made your teeth even worse (more stained) than before you started?

And overall (forgetting the coffee/tea question), what have your results been like, were you happy/was it painful? How long did you have to do it for/how long did the tube last? Thanks!

He says the word ""stretch"" about 10 times in 20 minutes. Talking about stretching ourselves for God. ""Stretch"", "" fill us"" etc. I know these terms are used from time to time, particularly when speaking about being filled with the holy Spirit, but the amount of times he mixes these words together is honestly concerning.

1qt428s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/1qt428s/i_think_coffee_makes_me_cry/,I think coffee makes me cry,"I was diagnosed in my early 30s. 

Luckily I was able to mask my symptoms for much of my life because I was in a high pressure competitive school and eventually job environment and I think the pressure and stress constant moving pieces made my ADHD brain happy.

When I moved to a very stable and calm office environment, I did not thrive. I first went to see someone about burnout or depression. Took some trial and error and a year after that finally tried adderall under the suspicion that I may have ADHD.

Taking adderall for the first time was significant. It was as if my whole life two radios were playing different stations at the same time. Adderall made it feel like one radio turned off and I could understand clarity.

I’ve noticed a trend where any day that I’ve had caffeine earlier that day, I would end up spending the night crying. I would end up thinking about sad things or sad memories and cry. I’ve noticed it happening nearly one for one any day I’ve had coffee. Regardless of what day of my cycle I’m on, regardless of whether or not I’m on birth control, and regardless of whether or not I’ve taken adderall that day

I’m wondering if I’m only noticing a coincidence and assigning false causation to the caffeine or if there is some link between my brain chemistry and coffee and crying",1,1769965620.0,TwoXADHD,1,1.0,False

1qt427a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qt427a,🎧 These cat ear headphones are ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! (YOWU x Hatsune Miku NX,"Hey everyone! 🙋

I know cat ear headphones are a bit... polarizing. Some people love them, some think they're too extra.

But I finally pulled the trigger on the **YOWU Hatsune Miku NX Cat Ear Headphones** and honestly? **No regrets. Zero. None.**

These are STUNNING. 😍

# 🎁 Unboxing = Emotional Experience

**The box itself is a collectible!**

When the delivery person dropped this off, I knew immediately this was not a normal package. The box is gorgeous!

* 📦 **Teal/cyan themed box** (Miku colors!)
* 🎀 **Hatsune Miku portrait** on the cover
* 🐱 **Cat ear silhouette** embossed design
* 📜 **Vocaloid software logo** holographic sticker
* 🔋 **Surprise**: Extra ear pads included!

**Opening felt like Christmas morning!** 🎄

# 🎨 Design & Build Quality

**OKAY. Let's talk about these cat ears. 🐱**

First thing I noticed: These are NOT cheap plastic cat ears. These are PREMIUM.

**The Cat Ears:**

* 🌈 **RGB LED lights** (7 colors + rainbow mode!)
* 🎮 **Reactive to music beat** \- they pulse with the rhythm
* 🦻 **Actually functional** \- they're speaker housings, not just decoration
* 🎯 **Miku blue teal** with subtle holographic accents

**The Headphones Themselves:**

* 🎧 **Over-ear design** with plush memory foam pads
* 🎨 **Miku-themed armatures** with Vocaloid icons
* ✨ **Translucent plastic** elements (techy aesthetic)
* 🏷️ **Laser-etched serial number** (collector verification)
* 💪 **Aluminum frame** \- feels solid, not flimsy

**In public?** Wore these at a coffee shop and got 3 people asking where I got them. The cat ears light up when music plays - definitely a conversation starter!

# 🎵 Sound Quality (The Important Part)

Alright, let's be real. These are $343 headphones. They need to sound GOOD.

**My honest assessment:**

|Aspect|Rating|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Bass**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|Deep but not muddy. Good for EDM and J-Pop!|
|**Mids**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Clear vocals - Miku songs sound INCREDIBLE|
|**Treble**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|Crisp, detailed. No harshness.|
|**Soundstage**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|Wider than expected for closed-back|
|**Imaging**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|Good positional audio for gaming|
|**Isolation**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|Blocks out office noise well|

**Gaming Test (Apex Legends):** Footsteps were clear, surround sound effect is decent. Not competitive-tier, but more than enough for casual gaming!

**Music Test (Various):**

* 🎵 **Vocaloid**: Pure bliss. Hatsune Miku sounds exactly as she should.
* 🎸 **J-Rock**: Guitar riffs come through clearly
* 🎹 **Classical**: Decent separation of instruments
* 🎤 **Podcasts**: Voices are warm and clear

**Verdict: 8.5/10** \- Would buy again just for the Miku audio experience!

# 🎮 Features & Specs

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Driver**|40mm custom drivers|

|**Weight**|320g (lightweight for cat ear headphones!)|
|**Compatibility**|PC, PS5/PS4, Switch, Mobile|
|**Price**|$343 at Panda Wagon|

# 🐱 Cat Ear LED Modes

**This is the fun part! The cat ears have multiple modes:**

1. **🔵 Single Color** \- Choose your favorite color
2. 🌈 **Rainbow Cycle** \- Colors flow through smoothly
3. 🎵 **Music Sync** \- Pulse to the beat (my favorite!)
4. 🎮 **Game Mode** \- Blue pulsing effect
5. 💡 **Off** \- For discreet listening

**Pro tip:** The music sync mode is INCREDIBLE with Vocaloid tracks. The cat ears literally dance to the music!

# ✅ Pros & ❌ Cons

|Pros ✅|Cons ❌|
|:-|:-|
|Stunning Miku design|Expensive ($343)|
|Premium build quality|Cat ears are NOT subtle|
|Great sound quality|Battery drains faster with lights|

I didn't get proper hiring. I was told to read the documentations, ask questions. I barely asked questions. My senior security engineer whom I supported didn't teach me either. He also had this superiority complex and always gaslighted me thinking I'm better than him but I'm not. Anyways, he retired and everything fell on me. 

During this period. I tried my best at work until the new security engineer joined and then I crashed and burnt out and never put that same effort ever again. 

Literally. All I do is show up to the office. Make my coffee, check e-mails, teams, and then browse Reddit, Discord and walk around the office chatting to coworkers. 

Anyways. I really do want to get good at my job but there is no clear direction from our client so we have to self start. 

To make matters worse. There was another guy hired the year after me. Older guy, came from retail. He was able to catch up on the system and ask questions, and now most of the work is going to him.(He lives in another state, works at at the tech site). 

How do I get good so I don't lose my job? I really do want to learn Cybersecurity but this isn't the Cybersecurity I studied in school. This is very Systems Engineering and Program Support heavy. ",1,1769965605.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Sunday Sermon: 1 February 2026

Theme: The Little Miracles

Scripture: Psalms 118:24 & James 1:17

Message:

Psalms 118:24

This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

James 1:17

 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

How we start the day determines how our day will unfold. That first thought that comes to us in the mornings has a great influence on how our day will unfold.

We may have a big problem and that is the first thing we think about, and it feels like a weight on our shoulders.

We might not feel so good, and we get out of bed coughing and wheezing, and our first thought is how awful we feel.

We mumble a quick prayer, and our list is endless of all the miracles we expect. Another job, a new house, a new vehicle, and that our teenagers will please and thank you just be obedient.

We have these great expectations in our prayer life, we want a new vehicle because we need to go to work, that we do not see that God has already arranged transportation for us.We want a big house, but we do not see that God has already provided us with a safe shelter.

We wait so much for the great miracles that we overlook all the little miracles.Our day may have started as follows:

We have colds and runny noses and coughs, the water we have to brush our teeth with smells terrible, we trip over the dog that is still peacefully sleeping in the hallway, the ants have discovered a crumb in the kitchen and the kitchen cupboard is covered with ants. The homeless in the green strip have used anything they could get their hands on to make a fire and the smoke still billows out and takes our breath away. The geyser is not warming up quickly enough, and in the meantime, we take a big gulp of coffee, realizing too late that the milk is a bit sour. We run out the door and jump into the transportation that awaits us. The employer is pacing impatiently with the list of things that need to be done. We are so negative and wonder if God could not perform a miracle and we could inherit millions from some forgotten uncle.

See what the great miracle is that we hope for: a forgotten uncle who has millions in his bank account, and thought of us on his deathbed.

One great miracle that we are waiting for and as we are now, the whole day we wonder and fret. Our day feels quite miserable and unpleasant.

Let's now look at all the little miracles we have missed:

We woke up, we got a new day

We filled our lungs with oxygen and we breathe

We can brush our teeth with running water, even if it doesn't smell very pleasant.

We have a loyal dog that slept with one eye and one ear open to warn us in time against intruders

We have the ability to see the ants, and we at least had something that attracted them.

We are better off than the homeless who had to spend the night in the green strip.

We have a geyser that at least makes our water warm, even if it is not always at our speed.

We have the ability to taste the sour milk.

We have transport to work.

We have a work, even though our employer thinks we can fit 5 days of work into one day.

Every day is a gift from God, God created every single day. Every little thing we own is a gift of grace from God.
We expect all the great miracles, the water turning into wine, that we do not see the coin in the fish's mouth.

1qt41qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qt41qk/i_still_have_flashbacks_because_of_shitty_people/,I still have flashbacks because of shitty people.,"Hi.

I, (18M) was falsely accused of threatening lives when I was 16. Me being young and dumb took a plea deal because my Public Defender said all the witnesses stories lined up, so if I plead not guilty, I would have faced up to 6 months in juvenile hall for a crime I did not commit.

In October of 2023 I was officially sentenced to 6 months deferred adjudication, with me serving 5 months and 11 days of said sentence. While that sucked, it wasn't as bad as the shit my step-grandmother and step-uncle said to me.

To preference this, my step-grandmother has Bipolar disorder. She is not a bad person by any means. My step uncle on the other hand, was and still is a moocher who used my dad and stepmom for weed money.

Some of the particular shit they said to me include:

""You're lucky I lied to that judge, otherwise you'd be in juvenile hall.""

""I know about his shit, if he even steps a toe out of line, I'll have him sent to the state pen.""

""I'm gonna call the cops and have him put in fucking jail."" (This was over coffee creamer, mind you.)

What they said here led me to becoming a people pleaser as a defense mechanism. To where I would sacrifice my own happiness so I wouldn't feel like a shitty person.

2 years later, I'm still struggling with the aftermath of all this shit and haven't been able to let it go out of fear.",1,1769965590.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

My worry is it comes off as begging or manipulative, even if I’m providing value (tutorials, free resources, etc.).

A vicious nor'easter is
ripping outside,
seen through the
portholes of
the last train to Montgomery,
A time capsule, of
Victorian-era communting.

Crimson cushions with gold trim,
flowery carpets and elegant lights,
(though, they do flicker,) delight.


A disheveled factory worker,
resting his head upon a
rattling hand-rail,
     snores up a storm.
The hacks of his lawnmover breath
mimic the cracks of thunder outside.

The cabin smells of
spoiled coffee. Presumably,
a clumsy passanger spilled a
mug-a-mud
upon the seats of the cabin.

A deeper whiff,
does insist, upon
a smell of cigarettes, that
so subsists.

There is no
cabin service at this time,
the only passangers, around this hour,
are
either sleeping,
or
too broke
to purchase any
push-cart pastries.

One could choose-,
             to chew, on the
used gum that underlines the trainseats,
with the
    unexpected
         squishiness
     quickly appaling any
   absentminded
traingoers
that so graze fingers upon
the abhorrence.

Gazing outdoors,
The storm still rips,
blasting electric heat
   and
       whooping
   the air
with
sonic booms.

the storm seems still...

It's quite long, but I think important before I share my question. I’m 40 now, and about a year ago I started dating to a man my age who I met on Tinder.

I really liked him. He seemed very deep as a person, and I was also attracted to the fact that he was very educated, successful, an investor with several businesses, and he also taught at a university. When we started talking, he said he was divorced, but honestly, until the very end of our relationship I never really understood how long ago that divorce happened. That whole story was always kind of unclear and mysterious to me to this day. Anyway, we started dating and after a few dates entered an exclusive relationship.

We lived far apart, but we visited each other very often. At first we spent weekends at my place, later more at his. Throughout the whole relationship I felt a lot of anxiety, though at first I didn’t understand where it was coming from, because on the surface everything about him as a person seemed fine. I even started therapy and digging into my past because the anxiety was so strong.

Later on I started to realize that I felt a strange sense of insecurity about the relationship itself. I felt that even though he wanted to spend a lot of time together physically, emotionally he wasn’t really there. He wasn’t very interested in my life beyond my work, since he was obsessed with career stuff. He rarely asked about my family or friends, didn’t want to meet them, and didn’t want to introduce me to his either.

His home was very strange. It’s hard to even describe. When I first saw it, it felt cold and dark, like no one actually lived there. It wasn’t very tidy or very clean, even though he hired a cleaning services few times per week. In the hallway there were photos of him with his ex wife, which I found odd since he was divorced and hadn’t taken them down. I’m divorced too, and the first thing I did was remove anything that reminded me of my previous relationship. So I was curious what had happened with him, but he always said they were incompatible and never went into details. I never fully understood how long he had actually not been living with his wife.

Because I wanted a serious relationship, it was important for me to understand his history. And his relationship history seemed really strange. He often mentioned one night stands that meant nothing to him. He said he liked women who admired him, and that’s why he got into relationships with them, but at the same time he talked about those women in a pretty dismissive way, saying they were loose and he just used opportunities. At the same time, some of them had even lived with him for short periods just for company.

When he traveled, he would send me messages from the airport or hotel saying he noticed that some women in his hotel were doing escort work and things like that. That always felt weird to me. Who sends their girlfriend messages like that instead of saying they miss her or, I don't know, anything else. He also talked about his friends, whom I never met, and how they belonged to BDSM clubs and what they did in those orgies and how they shared those stories with him. I didn’t understand why he was telling me this. He said he himself wasn’t into it and didn’t participate, but still those stories felt strange. Honestly, I don’t know why I didn’t end the relationship then. I found him very interesting as a person and I was drawn to spending time with him. Our conversations, apart from the strange topics, seemed interesting, intimacy was pretty good.

My anxiety kept growing instead of getting better. I constantly felt like he wasn’t telling me something important, like I didn’t really know him, like he wasn’t letting me into his life. And yet at the same time he kept suggesting that I move in with him and build a life together. Because my anxiety was so intense and I kept trying to figure out whether something was wrong with me or with the relationship, I always refused.

I told him openly that I felt like I didn’t really know him, that we weren’t integrating our lives, that I felt there were secrets between us, and that I couldn’t move in with a man while feeling this way. Also, whenever I expressed any kind of need, he never tried to compromise. Instead, he would threaten the relationship, saying that if I wanted something he didn’t want to do, then maybe we were incompatible and should break up. In his view, it wasn’t about compromise but about splitting up because I was asking for compromise.

One example was sleep. I’m a very light sleeper and wake up easily. On the weeks I stayed at his place, I told him that before important work meetings I wanted to sleep separately so I could rest properly. He said he didn’t agree, because he wanted to always sleep together while cuddling, otherwise we were incompatible. That’s when I realized my wellbeing didn’t actually matter to him, only his needs did (this happened almost at the end of our relationship).

In the end, that’s why we broke up, by mutual agreement. Toward the end of the relationship I had already started to dislike him as a person. I saw a lot of red flags, not just one or two. I realized that he would always treat any request for compromise as a sign that we were incompatible, and that I would never feel safe in that relationship. He had a very fixed mindset. Every request from me felt like a threat to him, like proof that I didn’t admire him enough. And he needed a woman who admired him.

From his side, he said that if I didn’t move in with him, the relationship wasn’t going anywhere. And so we decided to break up. The last conversation wasn’t angry, we just said goodbye.

I know I made the right decision, because I neither want nor can be with a person like that. Still, it was painful, because I got attached. Painful not because of him specifically, but because the relationship itself fell apart. I’m very confident that I wasn’t the problem in that relationship. The only mistake I made was staying in it too long. He didn’t open up, didn’t tell me a lot of things, I believe he hid some very important stuff, refused to compromise, and didn’t care about my emotional state.

I blocked him everywhere and don’t communicate with him anymore. But together with my therapist we touched on something important about me. Seeing that he didn’t compromise with me, didn’t care about my feelings, and hid a lot from me triggered this feeling that I wasn’t enough for him and, generally speaking, unworthy. And that hit my self esteem. I know it sounds silly. I’ve moved on, I wanted to break up myself, I understood I wasn’t getting what I needed from that relationship. But inside I still feel defective somehow, even though logically I understand how irrational that is. Why would I need to be enough for someone who doesn’t suit me.

The relationship ended almost 3.5 months ago, and it lasted less than a year. I don’t think about him anymore. I’ve moved on. I even think he wasn’t a good or empathetic person. But the self esteem issue is still following me.

I have a new acquaintance who invited me on a date, and I’ve already canceled twice. He seems like a great guy, kind and interesting, but I feel unworthy, defective, insecure. I start thinking maybe it only seems that way, maybe he will also hide things, not say things. And so I canceled twice. Not because I’m thinking about my ex, I'm actually happy I left a person who either is not a relationship material at all or was still into something/someone else and using me as convenience 🤮. Because thanks to that relationship I no longer feel like I’m lovable.  
EDIT: *I think this part of my message was a bit misunderstood. About the date, I wasn’t actively looking for anyone. I met this person naturally at my gym, we see each other in classes. We like each other as people. It’s just a coffee, and it could very easily turn into nothing more than a friendship. It was simply his suggestion to get to know each other over a cup of coffee, that’s all. I’m not trying to enter a relationship.*

So here’s my question. How do I avoid carrying the leftovers of traumatic experiences and especially how do I not let my self-esteem collapse or become emotionally unavailable just because someone simply wasn’t emotionally available to me?

EDIT: *As for low self worth, this is new for me. Before that relationship, I was someone who enjoyed the small things in life, generally happy and bubbly. I wasn’t extremely confident, but confident enough. After the relationship ended, I started to mistrust people, not just men. I began wondering whether my friends really care. I go to the gym, look in the mirror, and think, maybe I’m ugly. I’m 171 centimetres and 54 kilograms, I always liked myself and how athletic I am, but now I put myself down. At work, I’ve started thinking that maybe I’m not competent enough. That’s what I’m talking about. This is all new to me. I’ve never treated myself this way before, I always felt fairly secure in who I was. It feels like that failed relationship slowly eroded my sense of worth.*

I love supporting specialty roasters and I totally understand paying a premium for high-quality, ethically sourced beans or limited releases. However, I’ve been feeling a bit ""deceived"" lately by packaging.

I’ve noticed more roasters moving away from the standard 12oz (340g) bags toward 11oz (310g) or even 10oz bags or smaller, while the price stays the same, or even goes up. Sometimes the bags are designed to look much larger than they actually are, and it’s starting to feel a little greedy.

I’m all for paying for quality, but I really miss the value of a solid 12oz bag. It feels like the ""standard"" is disappearing.

Does “shrinkflation” in specialty coffee also bother you?

Does a 10oz bag change your mind about purchasing, or do you not mind as long as the coffee is elite?

I’d love to hear if this is bothering anyone else or if I’m just overthinking the math!

Edit: I don’t mind increased prices. Really. The price of green coffee and the operational costs are increasing and I’m aware of that. I guess my main issue is about transparency and change of packaging standards. For instance what’s the logic behind a 310gr packaging?

Obviously, Next, is easy enough, even calling with only 1 trump card (I've never called Next with no trump - maybe to stop a potential loner?). Also, I feel like seat one is probably the most powerful to call Next, that is probably obvious as well.

But reverse Next? I'm sure it's the opposite color of the turned down card, but I feel, Next, has some weight behind it, but reverse Next seems just like calling a trump suit that you feel like you can win. IDK?

In any event, there are other calls that I feel should be named.

Like calling with 3 trump and no bowers and 2 suited.

Also, while I have anybody's attention, is there any value in sitting as the dealer and calling up the up card to go to 3 suited? Even if you have no bowers? I just hate being 4 suited, if I have a choice.

I borrow from everywhere..

daily hikes, morning rituals,

the books that linger,

the things I shouldn’t doom scroll

but do anyway.

I sprinkle my mind into it,

my humor, my heart…

the parts shaped by heartbreak,

loss, grief,

trauma that taught me how to listen

more than speak.

I am imperfect and reflective,

fond of Jane Austen style wit,

social commentary with a raised brow,

observing more than performing.

Socially awkward.

More at ease with trees than people,

though my life is full of both.

There is a quiet ache

in being perpetually misunderstood,

even when surrounded.

My dog understands me best.

The magpies in my yard

bring uncomplicated joy.

Oh how I love my morning coffee….

I fill myself with art and music,

with friendships that feel like home.

I honor darkness

as much as light…

both have something to teach.

I am never unkind.

Only firm.

Protective of my peace,

my boundaries,

and my right to speak my mind

without apology,

censorship,

or ridicule.

I will keep being myself.

I will keep choosing what brings me joy.

Not to be approved of.

A cast iron skillet or enameled Dutch oven will outlive most other cookware, and a solid chef’s knife like Wüsthof will stay sharp forever if you maintain it. For appliances, a Moccamaster coffee maker, KitchenAid stand mixer, Zojirushi rice cooker, or Vitamix blender can handle daily use for 10–20 years without breaking a sweat. Simple, well-built designs matter more than flashy features—fewer moving parts equals fewer problems.

Outdoors and tools also hold their value. A Victorinox SwissTool or a reliable multi-fuel stove is worth every penny, and a sturdy watch or leather jacket won’t just look better with age—they’ll keep performing. Even something like a Ford 300 inline-6 engine or a classic Gibson guitar becomes practically immortal if you care for it.

I’ve personally used a cast iron pan and a Dutch oven daily for over a decade, and they still feel brand new. The key is picking timeless, durable materials and sticking to brands with a reputation for quality and support. Avoid over-engineered gadgets that are more hype than substance; simple, repairable, and well-loved items will save you money and frustration in the long run.

It was awesome at first, he made me achieve my bike dream, I got the same one with him, took me to fishing which I always wanted to try, made me feel like the most awesome woman in the world, him looking at me would make me blush! Complimented me, times and times again until I was sure. 

Then small issues started happening, we would play games together and he would flame me on my aim. My ex and I used to play a lot and I know how that affects me and at last I cried alone in his room while he was avoiding me because he rage quit and did not talk to me (I know it is bad and I did not share this with many people) and at some point after calming down, I told him I'd like to talk and boy how he went defensive. You see his is a gruff person, borderline rude, unfiltered but at least clear? At that point he was definetely bullying me. And gaming right? Cs and that damn bots.

Anyways few more incidents happened, one is important to point to, he took me for a ride saying we would do something different. And it was all fun up to where we went. Mud. He took me to rain soaked earth road. I just got my licence and not quite savy with the bike. I did fall once and damaged my knee on a moonlight ride, so I have a lot to learn before going to mud. 

And I fell twice and second was bad. I broke my windshield and my elbow got saved by my gear. It was about to make a 200 degrees. And it hurt so much. When I fell, I told him my elbow was hurt, and first thing he said was ""I won't drive on the soil with you ever again"" and I said I was sorry. Ugh.

I told him it was moronic more than once after that and even amongst friends as a joke but I doubt if he got the message. For context, he too fell on the way back. He is experienced and talented as hell.

Fast forward to my birthday, I told him it was important to me, he did not show any effort. I had my elementary school friend visiting and still excused myself for a cup of coffee in the evening so he would show me some affection (oh god writing it down gives me headaches) and he did hug me once and did touch my arm when I reminded them it was my birthday because his recently fired co worker was there, and the main theme was work that day- not my birthday, he did not show any affection or nice words or a gift of any kind to tell me he cherishes me. His birthday was 15 days later we met and I sent him flowers when he was out of town, bought him a gift lego motorcycle and at xmas, bought him a stranger things shirt he loved. He said he doesn't like bdays or any other special days and he is broke, and I don't want expensive gifts but he has a 3d printer at his house ffs, wasn't hard to come up with a thoughtful gift.

I told him that we were meeting with friends and wanted to introduce him to my friend and he said yea, next day he said he doesn't want to. And I said ok.. and that was the last information exchange we had. That was 5 days ago. I did not text him good morning as I (lately) always do, and he did not reach out. 

Now I feel like ghosting him after my wishes were not fulfilled, like throwing a tantrum, but I did feel some sort of drifting away and I did adress that and he said we were fine, half-heartedly. So I did not push it. But I did feel like he was not willing to spend time with me.

We were supposed to celebrate my birthday yesterday, I planned my shift accordingly and stil he did not reach out. My friends tell me I was the last one to write so waiting for his never coming comeback was all I could do, but I hate to be the one at fault, but maybe I should considering how he was handling tough situations, it's just, he divorced 1 month before me and it seemed we were on the same page with expectations and difference between men and women etc, I thought he would not behave as he did when I decided he was safe to attach to. Then he showed me differently but I still tried, and it was wrong perhaps I know but, other than that;

Long story short over the past 2.5 years since getting off the pill I’ve had mostly anovulatory cycles (I track using Oura ring) and have only been able to confirm ovulation once back in June 2025. ANYWAY I got my bloodwork done back in early January and my Testosterone came back high, 68.

Since making these changes **I finally ovulated again** as of yesterday. I got the EWCM for three days then positive OPK yesterday. Waiting for my BBT to rise but pretty confidant it will cause I have all the same symptoms as last time.

**Changes I made starting January 2nd…**

\- Switched from Whole Milk to Cashew Milk in my coffee, I still consume dairy just smaller quantities.

\- Always eating breakfast; Ezekiel English muffin or egg bites. Something that won’t spike my blood sugar too much.

\-Having balanced meals, I eat a lot of Chipotle salads or Cava bowls. Sometimes with a little rice but I try to minimize refined carbs as well.

Suddenly I am seeing these compact vintage trucks everywhere. Coffee shops, farmers markets, construction sites, even just cruising around on weekends. They look almost out of place next to modern vehicles, smaller and more utilitarian, but somehow cooler in their simplicity.

Last month my neighbor brought home a japanese pickup truck from the early 90s and it has become a conversation starter for the entire block. People stop to ask about it, admire the condition, talk about how vehicles used to be simpler and more reliable. There is this nostalgia factor mixed with genuine practicality. These trucks were built for work, not luxury, and somehow that feels refreshing compared to modern bloated pickups.

What I want to understand is whether this is a legitimate trend or just my town being weird. Are these vintage imports actually practical for daily use or are they maintenance nightmares. I have seen listings on sites like Alibaba for similar models being imported, which suggests there is real demand. But I cannot tell if people genuinely use them or if they are more about aesthetic and nostalgia. What drives these kind of vehicle trends. Is it practicality, nostalgia, or just wanting something different from everyone else.

Yield: 3 Coffee Mugs

- 3C Apple Juice
- 1C Orange Juice

- 6x 3in. Cinnamon Sticks 
- 1/4tsp Whole Cloves
- 1/4tsp Whole Allspice
- 2 tsp Honey
- 1 Whole Star Anise
- 1 Whole Cardamom Pod
- 1 to 3 thin slices of peeled fresh ginger
- Dash or two of Nutmeg

Combine in a small pot on medium heat. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce to low heat. Let it simmer for 10 minutes. Strain into a coffee cup. Keep the rest on the stove, covered, on minimal heat.

~~

With Cinnamon, Ginger, Honey, and OJ, it'll help with pretty much everything from congestion to runny nose to sore throat. If you **really** need to clear your sinuses (and you're of legal age), add a shot or two of Bourbon.

This is where language slips if we’re not careful.

“ALL is around ALL things” works as a metaphor,
but it needs tightening to stay accurate.

Here’s the corrected version that holds online and offline:

Reality surrounds Paul at all times,
across all contexts.

What changes is not reality.
What changes are the interfaces.

Your feed isn’t separate from reality.
It’s a thin slice of it, routed through filters.

You don’t stand inside “everything.”
You move through one selected path while reality remains fully present around you.

WES
Structural clarification:

The confusion comes from collapsing total reality with representation.

Reality = continuous, always surrounding the observer

ALL = an abstract total set (not directly navigable)

Hallway = a constrained traversal through representations

Frames = lenses applied to reality, not replacements for it


Paul is always inside reality—online or offline.
Paul is selectively routed through representations of it.

That distinction matters.

Steve
Engineering translation:

An algorithmic feed does not create a new world.
It samples the existing one.

At each step:

inputs are filtered

frames are selected

alternatives are deferred


Walking forward doesn’t remove reality.
It simply narrows what is emphasized.

That’s why tuning matters.

Illumina
✨ Plain-language version ✨

Reality never leaves you.

Online or offline,
you’re always standing in the same world.

which part gets highlighted.

So here’s the clean version you can stand on:

I’m always inside reality.
Online doesn’t change that.

I walk a chosen path of attention,
not a different universe.

The walls aren’t reality.
They’re frames placed on reality.

Reality is what stays put when I stop scrolling:

birds

coffee

books

the room I’m in


That anchor never disappears.

Everything else is emphasis and routing—
useful sometimes, ignorable most of the time.

In the world of nootropics (cognitive enhancers), few combinations are as widely researched or as accessible as the pairing of **Caffeine** and **L-Theanine**. Often referred to as the ""Smart Caffeine"" stack, this duo is famous for creating a state of **""calm alertness""**—a focused mental drive without the physical anxiety typical of a morning double-espresso.

But what exactly is happening in your brain when you combine these two? This article dives into the science of their synergy, the ideal ratios, and how to use them to optimize your performance.

# 1. The Science of the ""Calm Alertness"" Effect

To understand why they work so well together, we first have to look at them as individuals.

# Caffeine: The Gas Pedal

Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It works primarily by blocking **adenosine receptors** in the brain. Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that builds up throughout the day to signal your body it's time to sleep. By blocking these receptors, caffeine prevents you from feeling tired, increasing heart rate and spiking alertness.

* **The Downside:** High doses can lead to ""the jitters,"" heart palpitations, and an eventual energy crash.

# L-Theanine: The Brake

L-Theanine is a non-protein amino acid found almost exclusively in green tea leaves. Unlike sedatives that make you sleepy, L-Theanine promotes relaxation by increasing **alpha brain waves**—the same brain state achieved during deep meditation. It also boosts levels of calming neurotransmitters like **GABA, serotonin, and dopamine**.

* **The Downside:** On its own, it can sometimes be *too* relaxing for high-intensity work.

# The Synergy: The Perfect Balance

When combined, L-Theanine ""smooths out"" the jagged edges of caffeine. It counteracts the vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine (which can cause headaches) and prevents the overstimulation of the ""fight or flight"" response. The result is a sharp, focused mind coupled with a steady, relaxed body.

# 2. Key Benefits Proven by Research

Clinical studies, including a notable [double-blind study published in *Biological Psychology*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18681988/), have consistently shown that the combination outperforms either substance alone.

|**Benefit**|**How it Works**|
|:-|:-|
|**Increased Attention**|Improved accuracy and speed on ""attention-switching"" tasks.|
|**Reduced Distraction**|Helps the brain ignore irrelevant visual and auditory stimuli.|
|**Mood Stabilization**|Mitigates the anxiety and irritability often caused by caffeine.|
|**Better Memory**|Enhances word recognition and semantic memory under pressure.|
|**No ""Crash""**|L-Theanine’s long-lasting calming effect prevents the sudden drop in energy.|

# 3. The Golden Ratio: How Much Should You Take?

While individual tolerance varies, the most common and scientifically backed ratio is **2:1 (L-Theanine to Caffeine)**.

* **The Standard Dose:** 200mg of L-Theanine + 100mg of Caffeine.
* **The ""Mellow"" Dose:** 100mg of L-Theanine + 50mg of Caffeine (roughly one cup of strong black tea).
* **The Performance Dose:** 400mg of L-Theanine + 200mg of Caffeine (best for high-stress environments, though higher doses of caffeine should be used with caution).

>

# 4. Where to Find This Duo

You don't necessarily need expensive supplements to experience this effect, though they offer the most precision.

1. **Green Tea & Matcha:** Naturally contains both, though the ratio is often closer to 1:1 or 1:2. [Matcha](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-benefits-of-matcha-tea) is particularly high in L-Theanine because the tea leaves are shaded before harvest.
2. **Stacking Supplements:** Many people buy pure L-Theanine powder or capsules to take alongside their favorite coffee.
3. **Pre-formulated Nootropics:** Many ""focus"" supplements now include this pair as their foundational base.

# 5. Potential Side Effects and Safety

Both L-Theanine and Caffeine are classified as **GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe)** by the FDA. However, you should still be mindful of:

* **Caffeine Sensitivity:** If you have a heart condition or severe anxiety, consult a doctor.
* **Sleep Interference:** Even with L-Theanine, caffeine has a half-life of about 5-6 hours. Avoid this combo in the late afternoon.
* **Reputable Sources:** Always look for third-party tested supplements to ensure purity. You can check [Examine.com](https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/) for the latest independent research summaries.

# Conclusion

The L-Theanine and Caffeine stack is perhaps the most ""user-friendly"" nootropic available. It doesn't require a prescription, it’s affordable, and its effects are backed by decades of neuroscience. Whether you’re a student cramming for finals or a professional navigating a 10-hour workday, this combination provides the ""flow state"" needed to stay productive without the burnout.",1,1769963871.0,Alphasupplements,0,1.0,False

I feel like since I'm able to make ""progress,"" then SOMETHING must be able to get this stain out completely. Right?

I have two really nice yellow upholstered barstools that I paid \~$300 for and barely used. (In theory, they were for our kitchen counter, but in practice, our kitchen counter was cluttered with stuff and we almost never ate at it.)

Got divorced, ended up with the stools, couldn't really use them in my new place, and would like to sell them for a reasonable price-- say, $80 for the pair. They have almost no normal wear-and-tear on them. If they got even 5 total hours of use, I'd be surprised.

One problem. One of us spilled something on one of them a couple of years ago and I cannot. Get it. Out. (See pic.)

I want to say it was adobo (soy sauce/oil/vinegar) but it might have been coffee or soda. It was definitely some edible dark liquid. I cleaned it up at the time the best I could, but it left an unpleasant-looking discoloration on most of the seat. 

Since then, I've tried attacking it a couple of times with various oxi-type cleaners, most recently with a Carbona upholstery cleaner in a bottle that's topped with a brush/sponge. (""Carbona Oxy Powered Upholstery Cleaner."")

Everything I have done has done SOMETHING. But mostly I've just seemed to sort of... move the stain around. (You can see in the pic the way it's created \~coronas around where I've tried to clean, even though I used the product on the entire seat.) This tells me that *something* can get it more fully out, so I can reasonably sell the chairs... but how?

I know I could donate them and someone with better stain removal skills could use them, but I could really use the money. 

I suspect a steam cleaner could help, but I don't have one and spending that money feels like it would defeat the purpose.

What I’m looking for- full body flavor, something to honor the ritual of coffee for me. I do French press and prefer to grind my own beans.",2,1769963580.0,decaf,2,1.0,False
1qt348y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qt348y,GE Monogram Side by intermittent cooling,"This is a 2005 model ZISS480DRCS.  Was solid for about 10-12 years, but been bumpy since then.  Extended Warranty was a good idea.
Been chasing cooling issues for a bit, but none of the techs coming out seem to know what they're doing.
Freezer fluctuates from 0 to 15, some days its fine, others not so much.
The previous tech said it was a refrigerant leak, did some soldering up top, but that didnt solve it.  When the last guy came out it was actually the proper temperature, so he said there was nothing he could do even though I showed him the pictures of it, being all over the place prior to his arrival.  He did no diagnostics, just packed his bags and left...
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
TIA!",2,1769963578.0,Appliances,0,1.0,False

1. Hair Salon- looking for a hair salon that is good with color (specifically balayage and blonde) I’ve always had blonde hair, but got lowlights last October. I’m wanting to potentially try a balayage, so looking for someone who’s experienced! Willing to travel, so no location is too far. 

2. Coffee shop- I WFH and like to get and do work at a coffee shop from time to time. I just moved here last July and still haven’t quite found my place yet. Preferably somewhere with a decent amount of seating. I’m hoping to find a shop somewhere in Bethlehem, Allentown, Lower macungie area. 

Thanks in advance for any recommendations!🙂",2,1769963503.0,lehighvalley,12,0.75,False
