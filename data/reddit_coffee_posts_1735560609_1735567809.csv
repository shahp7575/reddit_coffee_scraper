So, as the title says my boyfriend uses minoxidil, we know it is toxic so he usually wakes up and moves his pillow immediately. This morning I was cuddling in bed with my pup and noticed her licking his pillow. I quickly moved it away, I'd say she was licking the pillow no more than 10 seconds.

For extra info here, he used the minoxidil before bed. It would not have been at all damp on the pillow, it would be completely dry. He usually only uses it on the top of his head. 

About 35 minutes after we got up I noticed my dog having some tremors or perhaps shaking. I knew she couldn't have got into anything yet this morning, and then remembered the pillow. I looked it up and saw that tremors can be a sign of minoxidil poisoning. Right after, I had to take her for her walk, so we went off. She was totally normal on her walk, and again normal when we got home. No tremors or shaking.

Some extra info here... She gets very anxious with weird noises... She will start shaking. Usually a walk will snap her out of it. Our coffee maker was making weird noises this morning, but not the typical noises that would trigger her anxiety. 

So, I'm left wondering if the tremors were just noise anxiety or if it could be more. She is continuing to be normal. She had a drink and played and is back to napping. 

Is there anything here I should be worried about at this point?

Also, I'll be having a big chat with my fiance on how much more careful he needs to be if he intends to keep using this product. ",1,1735567573.0,DogAdvice,0,1.0,False

But with the lid on, the 10oz doesn’t seem big enough. What size mug do you prefer for a home coffee?

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1735567332.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

Look at all the things that are stopping you — you don’t have the perfect recording space, can’t decide which mic to buy, or you don’t know how to design a WOW thumbnail. 

Add up these small, individual blockers & they form a massive wall between you and that PUBLISH button. Now, that wall is actually a precarious Jenga tower. This post will pull out the last supporting block and scatter those excuses on the floor.

**Here’s what we’ll cover:**

1. Picking your topic (briefly)
2. Outlining your first 4 pillar episodes
3. Connecting with your audience with 4 stories
4. Keeping momentum with your next 12 episodes

# Pick your YouTube podcast topic

If you’re already here, you watch quite a few podcasts and filed away some ideas of what you’d do as the host.

Take inspiration from the shows you enjoy — they’re doing something right! But there’s one risk that I’ll highlight right away. That’s launching a show around you (and your co-hosts) commentary on whatever’s trendy right now. 

Big, established shows can pull this off and viewers will keep coming back to them. They’ve proved their value to their listeners over years. But starting with that can be a dead end. 

*Unless you’re bringing a massive reputation & big audience from some other platform, relying only on your hot takes is risky.* 

**Choose a niche you’re passionate about**

That passion is your foundation. On top of that you want a topic with depth and some level of dynamic change over time. You may be very obsessed with baking the perfect chocolate chip cookie but by episode 12 you’ll have scratched all the way to the bottom of the mixing bowl and be out of episode ideas.

Find your niche from either professional experience or a side hobby you’ve been into for years. The other option is to take viewers on a learning journey with you as you take up something new, but this may be better as a vlog-style series.

# Outline your first 4 Pillar episodes

The goal of the first 10 episodes is to reach as many people as possible and hook them into subscribing. For a few, that may happen on episode 1, but chances are many more won’t find your show until episode 3, 8 — or even 30. 

So the point of Pillar episodes is to always have a roadmap for your new listeners to follow.

Take your chosen niche and break it down into 4 broad, timeless categories. These are the discussions that always pop up, the questions newbies always ask, your high-level ideas/frameworks/opinions that you bring to your topic. 

If you're new, these Pillar episodes are not going to be your best, most amazing shows because you’re new and your skills will improve over time.

They exist to give your future shows and listeners a clear anchor point — a short series to clearly understand your premise.

# Connect with your audience with 4 stories

Pair each Pillar with a story. Even in the age of AI, we’re still very socially wired as humans. Your audience will want to know **how** and **why** you came to these ideas. 

If you’re co-hosting, one of you can take the role of interviewer in these episodes. If you’re doing 1-on-1 guest interviews, try to line up guests that match each pillar thesis. 

These should be formative stories in your life, ones you’ve told many times over coffee or beer. You want to be comfortable with the content and smooth with delivery. Just like [the story in Reservoir Dogs](https://youtu.be/SP3BNTi35XI?si=9hX1nViHqKqSLA1b), you’re building rapport here with people (new listeners) who don’t quite know if they should trust you. 

Then the logical path is always back to your Pillar episode. So if you hook someone on story 3, they go back to Pillar 3 and then they want to know all your Pillar ideas, binge all your shows and become a happy subscriber ever after!

By the time you finish the 4th story, you’ll have 8 episodes published and you should be getting feedback on the show. If you make it that far, you’ve already beat the \~47% of podcasts that [never published more than 3 episodes](https://www.amplifimedia.com/blogstein-1/lyspqop3ylro9a2t7y2de820uwkgwx).

# Keep momentum with your next 12 episodes

You now have your binge bank published — those four Pillar episodes and stories that you should refer to regularly as you move into your ‘regular’ show cadence. 

Use these first 20 shows to get into a rhythm.

If you started out thinking you could push out 1 show per week but realize by episode 12 that you’re totally stressed out — dial it back. Growing your audience is not just about putting out new episodes, but also marketing the ones you’ve already published.

This plan is simple because getting to episode ten with a new show is not easy. There are a lot of little tasks that you won’t see if you’ve never launched a show before.

Get your workflow and tools dialed for:

* thumbnails
* writing descriptions
* publishing [short clips](https://clipwing.pro/blog/post/5-strategies-to-make-more-engaging-reels-shorts-or-tiktoks) on social media
* handling remote recordings, etc etc.

The more of these processes you get dialed in ahead of the launch, the faster you’ll be able to put things on autopilot so that the show production itself takes less time and mental energy. 

You want to put all that towards the content, building a guest network, engaging with the audience — the fun stuff!",2,1735567288.0,podcasting,0,1.0,False

When we were first going out he was kind, generous, interesting, wanted to do different activities, and treated me very well. Right before we started dating we were hanging out at his house where I learned that he lives with his mom and sister. I didn’t think that this was a red flag or huge deal at first because I also moved back in with my parents after I graduated college last year. The quality of our relationship has gone downhill ever since he asked me to be his girlfriend. He has already blocked and broken up with me twice and apologized the next day begging to see me. He gets extremely mad when I can’t come over for any reason (holidays, family members birthdays, friends visiting from out of town have been no exception). In fact any time I do anything without him I feel like he tries to pick a fight to ruin my day. To add to this I have just realized his laziness and lack of ambition. He has had a bowl and spoon in his room since we first started dating (3 months ago). There is constantly trash in his room. One day he texted me that it was cold and he wanted to close the window but he couldn’t because “my stuff” was there. Which consisted of an empty coffee cup and another drink from last time I was over days before. When I told him to just walk over and throw it away he got mad and said that it was my trash and my job to throw away. Which like fine, I should have picked up after myself but he had double the amount of trash from himself in the room, and ever since he said this I always make sure I throw everything I use away so he can’t blame me. *side note: he used a Taco Bell cup as a water cup for 2 months, they have real cups in the house I can’t wrap my head around this, I made sure to always bring a water bottle after week 2 of the Taco Bell cup. Recently I went over and when I had to go to the kitchen I took down all of his trash (mostly fast food bags/ the actual food) that had been sitting there since the last time I’d been over. He asked me “why are you cleaning my room?” And i said I was taking it out because it’s gross to leave food sitting in your room. He replied “oh I thought you we’re just being nice”. He also never fixes the sheet on his bed and will literally just sleep on the mattress unless I’m there to fix it. He’s wet the bed 4 or 5 times now when I’ve slept over. He blames his medication but usually it is because he is drinking and refuses to admit this. I found out that he basically helps his mom with nothing around the house. His mom got us pizza and I thanked her and she said my bf was going to send her some money since he doesn’t pay for rent or utilities or anything. He also constantly bickers with his mom and sister and cusses at them which I hate. It’s his moms house and I don’t know the entire situation but his mom recently moved back in after living with a boyfriend. He told me that he’s “counting down the days until she leaves” so it doesn’t sound like he has any plans of moving out. But it’s literally her house?? He also has a dog that he doesn’t take care of which I see in person and his mom has told me. Last week I came over and his mom asked what time I got there and if he fed the dogs and he straight up lied about it and got mad at me for telling the truth. I love dogs but I won’t even pet his dog because it’s so dirty I want to kidnap him and give him a bath. His mom is constantly reminding him to do things like let the dogs out, take out the trash, he is so lazy that he leaves his clean clothes in the basement (there are literally no clothes in his room). I don’t think that he has a car (which usually wouldn’t be a huge problem but on top of all of this it’s not a good look). He works in construction and his boss/uncle takes him to and from work everyday (he has also threatened to fight him more than once since we started dating). This whole thing has just been a huge chaotic mess and I’m ready to be done and leave this in 2024. I am okay with being single all next year if it means I don’t have to put up with someone like this. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt in the beginning but I’ve put up with this way longer than I should. Here’s to having standards in 2025 :)",3,1735566814.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1hpnnas,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpnnas,Katakana in Japanese language is way more frustrating than you think,"Katakana is essentially "" English word "" of Japanese language and sometimes you will hear Japanese people speaking some words that sound like English word. The problem is the pronounciation and understanding it from the readings. For example, I have to pronounce Google as Gu-Go-Ru or else Japanese people won't understand what I am referring to. The pronunciation is just slightly different but to them, it's huge difference.

For us like Japanese language learner, it's easy to memorize each letter of Katakana, but when you combine them into words, it just got a lot of harder. 

The process is like this: I recieved a Katakana word; I am trying to read it aloud one letter at a time (not to mention there are dashes too which extends the sound of pronounciation); finally I need to think what English word correspond it. It might sound easy but you will understand when you try to learn this language. So then one day, I tried to order food at a coffee shop in Japanese and just when I see the menu with full of Katakana, I gave up immediately and order the food by showing him the English side of menu.

1hpnmmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/healingspirit/comments/1hpnmmd/when_grief_knocks_opening_the_door_to_comfort_and/,"""When Grief Knocks: Opening the Door to Comfort and Healing"" para ...","In the quiet aftermath of loss, where words often fall short and the weight of sorrow feels all-consuming, your presence can be a silent hymn of comfort to a grieving soul. Embarking on the journey alongside someone enveloped in grief is no easy task; it demands patience, understanding, and an ocean of empathy. If you find yourself as a companion on this delicate path, know that your support is a beacon of hope amid the shadows of loss. In this guide, we will walk through several profound and sincere ways to stand by someone in their most vulnerable hours, helping you become a pillar of support when it matters most.

 

 **The Power of Listening Without Judgment: The Healing Process of Being Heard**

 

In the tapestry of grief, each person weaves a distinct pattern of pain and memories that color their experience of loss uniquely. When you listen without judgment, you become a custodian of their stories, a guardian of their right to mourn in their own way and time. This act of listening goes beyond mere silence; it involves an active, compassionate engagement with the grieving person's emotional world.

 

Active Listening:

Active listening is the foundation of providing support. It involves making a conscious effort to hear the words another person is saying and, more importantly, the complete message being communicated. To practice active listening:

 

Maintain eye contact gently, without staring, to show focus and concern.

Nod in understanding, and offer non-verbal cues like a hand on the shoulder if appropriate.

Avoid interrupting while they're speaking. Let them lead the conversation.

Ask open-ended questions to encourage them to express themselves more fully.

Reflect back on what you’ve heard in your own words to confirm your understanding.

Creating a Safe Space:

Creating a safe space for someone to express their grief involves both physical and emotional aspects. This might mean setting aside private time and place for them to talk, where they won't be overheard or interrupted. It also means fostering an environment of emotional safety:

 

Assure them that there’s no ‘right’ way to feel and that you’re there to listen to all they wish to share, whether it’s sorrow, anger, guilt, or even relief.

Validate their emotions by acknowledging that their feelings are normal and acceptable, no matter what they are.

The Benefits for the Grieving Person:

For someone who is grieving, having a trusted person to talk to can be immeasurably beneficial:

 

Emotional Release: Speaking about their loss helps in the cathartic release of pent-up emotions, reducing the risk of them becoming overwhelming.

**Clarification:** Talking helps people clarify their thoughts and feelings, which is often difficult during the confusion of grief.

Perspective: Through conversation, they may gain new insights into their experiences, helping them process their grief.

Connection: They feel less alone in their pain, fostering a sense of connection and understanding, which is crucial for emotional healing.

In summary, being a good listener offers your ears a bridge over the turbulent waters of grief. Your attentive presence affirms the grieving person's feelings, providing them with the essential human connection that supports healing. Your role is not to steer their grief in a direction you deem fit but to walk beside them, providing companionship and witness to their sorrowful journey. This is one of the most potent gifts you can offer – the gift of being heard, understood, and accepted without the pressure of being ‘fixed’.

 

**How to help someone who is grieving, a practical approach.**

 

When grief casts its long shadow, it often creates a sense of disorientation that makes even the simplest tasks feel Herculean. Stepping in to shoulder some of this burden is a deeply compassionate act. Here are seven practical ways you can offer tangible assistance to someone navigating the murky waters of grief:

 

1. Meal Preparation:

 

Cook and deliver homemade meals that can be easily reheated.

Organize a meal train with friends and family to ensure a steady supply of nutritious meals.

Stock their pantry with healthy snacks and staples, mindful of any dietary restrictions or preferences.

2. Household Management:

 

Offer to clean or hire a cleaning service for their home.

Help with laundry—wash, fold, and put away clothes.

Assist with pet care, such as feeding, walking, or taking pets to veterinary appointments.

 

3. Errands and Shopping:

 

Run errands like picking up groceries, prescriptions, or dry cleaning.

Shop for essentials or set up delivery services for them.

Accompany them to go shopping if they need support and company.

 

4. Administrative Tasks:

 

Offer to help with paperwork that may be confusing or overwhelming, such as insurance claims or bills.

Lend a hand in planning funeral arrangements if they are comfortable with it.

Assist in organizing and sorting personal items, especially when they decide it’s time.

 

5. Child and Family Care:

 

Offer to babysit to give them personal time to grieve or take care of themselves.

Drive children to and from school or extracurricular activities.

Help with homework or hire a tutor if children are falling behind.

 

6. Transportation:

 

Provide rides to appointments, support groups, or to get out of the house.

Manage car maintenance, such as oil changes or tire rotations, which can be easily forgotten.

 

7. Emotional Check-ins:

 

Please send a text or make a call to let them know you’re thinking of them.

Please invite them for walks or outings, without pressure, to gently reintroduce social interaction.

Remember to check in periodically, as grief doesn't have an expiration date, and your support may be needed for a long time.

When you offer practical help, always communicate clearly and listen to their needs and preferences. Some may appreciate the gesture but prefer to manage certain tasks themselves, as it can be a part of their coping mechanism. Be flexible and let them guide you on how to be most helpful. Your support can make a significant difference in their healing process, lifting the practical burdens so they can have the space and strength to deal with their emotions.

 

 

 **Supporting Someone through Grief: Understanding Individual Paths to Healing**

 

In its profound complexity, grief is as individual as the person experiencing it. There is no universal roadmap, prescribed timeline, or right or wrong way to navigate the choppy seas of bereavement. Respecting a person's unique way of processing loss is not just about giving them space; it’s about honoring their individuality in the face of sorrow. Here are three ways you can respect and support someone’s grieving journey:

 

1. Be Patient and Give Them Time:

 

Don’t rush them through their grief. Grief has its own pace, and what may seem like a prolonged period to some may be necessary for their healing process.

Avoid statements that imply a timeline, such as “It’s been several months,” or “You should be moving on by now.” These can be more hurtful than helpful.

2. Support Their Way of Expressing Grief:

 

If they prefer solitude, allow them that space. Check in with them to ensure they know you're still there when they're ready to reach out.

For those who share stories, listen to them recount memories, speak of their loved ones, or express their emotions. Your engagement with their stories validates their feelings and the importance of their loss.

Respect their cultural practices and rituals surrounding death and mourning, which may differ from yours. Show interest and ask if there's anything specific they would like to do to honor these traditions.

 

3. Adapt to Their Changing Needs:

 

Understand that the grieving process is dynamic. Be attentive to shifts in their needs and be willing to adjust your support accordingly.

Please encourage them to share how they’re feeling and what they need from you as time passes. They might require more company, solitude, or different forms of support as they work through their grief.

Provide consistent support without overwhelming them. Sometimes, knowing someone is there and willing to adapt to their needs is a significant comfort.

You respect their process by demonstrating patience, listening actively, and staying attuned to the grieving person’s needs. This respect affirms their right to grieve in their way and communicates your unwavering support and understanding. It's essential to remember that while the pain of loss is universal, the path to healing is personal, and your sensitive and adaptive presence can be a profound source of comfort.

 

**Encourage Self-Care and Boundaries: Nurturing Resilience in Grief**

 

The journey through grief is not only emotional but can also be physically and mentally draining. Encouraging self-care and the establishment of boundaries is a gentle reminder to those grieving that while they navigate their loss, they also need to honor and take care of their well-being. Here are five ways you can encourage a grieving person to practice self-care and set healthy boundaries:

 

1. Promote Physical Health:

 

Encourage regular, gentle exercise like walking, yoga, or stretching to help alleviate stress and boost mood.

Suggest nutritious meal options and, if possible, help prepare them. Nutrition can often be neglected during intense periods of grief.

Advocate for enough rest and sleep, which can be disrupted during grief. Offer to help create a restful environment or provide resources for sleep hygiene.

2. Support Emotional Wellness:

 

Recommend journaling or creative activities to express emotions and process grief.

Introduce mindfulness or meditation practices that can help manage anxiety and provide moments of calm and reflection.

3. Facilitate Social Connection:

 

Please encourage them to maintain social contact but also reassure them that it’s okay to decline invitations when they’re not feeling up to it.

Help them communicate their needs and boundaries to others. This can be especially important when high social expectations (e.g., on holidays or anniversaries).

4. Uphold Personal Boundaries:

 

Assist them in identifying their limits, such as how much time they spend on activities or with others, and encourage them to honor them.

Advocate for their right to privacy when needed, reinforcing the importance of taking time without guilt.

5. Suggest Professional Support:

 

Encourage them to seek professional help if they’re struggling to manage daily life or need someone to talk to who is unbiased.

Offer to help research therapists or grief counselors, and if they’re open to it, assist with making appointments or travel arrangements.

Self-care and setting boundaries are vital yet often overlooked aspects of navigating grief. By encouraging these practices, you’re helping the grieving person look after themselves and empowering them to take control where they can in a situation that often feels out of their control. Remember, self-care isn’t selfish; it’s a necessary component of healing, and setting boundaries is a fundamental part of that self-care. Through your support, the person grieving can find the strength to prioritize their well-being as they honor their loss.

 

 

4. Encourage Professional Support:

Sometimes, the road through grief requires a guide. Encourage seeking professional support when needed. A grief counselor or support group can provide specialized care and understanding that friends and family may not be equipped to offer.

 

5. Remember Significant Dates:

Anniversaries, birthdays, and holidays can reopen the wounds of loss. Mark these dates in your calendar and reach out. A simple message, a hand to hold, or a shared memory can mean the world.

 

**Keep Your Promises: The Cornerstone of Trust in Times of Loss**

 

When loss makes the future uncertain, the reliability of a friend or family member becomes a precious commodity. Promises, when kept, can help rebuild the crumbling edifice of a grieving person's sense of security. Here's how your commitment to your word can be a powerful support:

 

1. Offers a Reliable Routine:

 

Create a consistent schedule of contact or visits that they can rely on. Whether it’s a weekly coffee date or a nightly phone call, the regularity provides something predictable in a time of chaos.

Be punctual when you make plans to meet or speak with them. Timeliness shows respect for their time and situation.

2. Builds Trust:

 

Follow through on small commitments, like calling when you will or showing up on time. These acts reinforce trust, which can be exceptionally comforting when they may question many other aspects of their life.

Be honest about what you can and cannot commit to. It’s better to offer less and be consistent than to make grand promises you can’t fulfill.

3. Creates a Safety Net:

 

Be there for the hard moments, like anniversaries or the deceased's birthday. Your presence, whether in-person or via a call, can provide emotional support on days that are likely particularly challenging.

Act as a buffer in social situations if they’re not ready to face certain people or events.

4. Strengthens Emotional Support:

 

Please encourage them to express their needs and feelings and respond with actions showing that you’re listening and caring. For instance, if they mention missing a particular activity they used to enjoy, suggest doing it together when they’re ready.

When appropriate, share your feelings. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to the world around them.

5. Provides Stability:

 

Help them plan for demanding days and be there as promised. Sometimes, just knowing you will be there can alleviate the anxiety about facing those days alone.

Offer a steadfast presence that reassures them they are not alone in their grief journey.

By keeping your promises, you signal the grieving person that they have a sturdy shoulder to lean on. Your unwavering presence and reliability can offer solace and stability, helping them navigate their new reality with a trusted companion. In a period marked by unpredictability, your consistency becomes a lifeline, a testament to your care, and a beacon of hope that can guide them toward calmer shores.

 

**Why we shouldn’t try to fix grief.**

 

Grief is a Personal Process: Every person experiences and processes grief differently. It's a profoundly personal journey influenced by an individual's emotional makeup, life experiences, and the nature of their loss. Trying to fix them implies there is a standard or correct way to grieve, which isn't true.

 

Validation of Feelings: Grief is a valid emotional response to loss. By attempting to fix it, we may inadvertently communicate that their feelings are invalid or that they should be feeling something different. Instead, validating their emotions as a natural reaction to their experience is essential.

 

Healing Takes Time: Healing from a loss is not a quick fix; it's a process that takes time. The notion of fixing suggests that there is a rapid solution, but grief often involves a gradual journey of finding a new normal at one's own pace.

 

Grief Can Foster Growth: While incredibly painful, grieving can also lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of life and relationships. Interrupting this process with attempts to fix it might prevent the person from experiencing the potential growth that can come from working through their grief.

 

Support, Not Solutions: Grieving people often need support and presence, not solutions. Being there for them, listening without judgment, and offering a supportive space where they can express themselves freely can be more helpful than trying to provide answers or fixes to their pain.

 

When we let go of the impulse to resolve the hurt, we open ourselves to be genuinely present with the suffering person. This presence doesn't seek to change the person's feelings, but rather to share in the burden of their pain. It is a powerful act of solidarity that says, “You are not alone in this.”

 

Furthermore, by refraining from fixing, we respect the individuality and integrity of the person's own healing journey. We acknowledge that, in the vast landscape of human experience, grief is a territory that each must navigate in their own way and time. Our role isn't to pave over the rough terrain but to walk alongside them, bearing witness to their struggle and resilience.

 

This approach is rooted in humility and respect. It allows us to set aside our discomfort with pain and loss and, instead, offer what those grieving might need most—our empathy, time, and unconditional support. The gift of such companionship can become a silent hymn of comfort, a beacon of hope that helps illuminate the path through the shadows of loss. It’s about being a pillar that doesn't seek to alter the shape of their sorrow but offers a steady foundation should they lean on it.

 

In embracing this role, we help to create a space where healing can occur in its own natural rhythm. In this space, the quiet alchemy of transformation takes place—where the sharp edges of sorrow can eventually soften and where the heart, given patience and time, may find a way to begin mending itself.

 

**Never sell yourself short; God uses you to heal another person's heart.**

 

**Prayer**

 

 Loving God, in Your infinite compassion, You comfort those in sorrow. We lift up to You the tender souls who have taken on the mantle of comforters, those caring for the bereaved. Grant them strength as they offer shoulders to lean on and ears that listen with patient grace.

 

Bless their words that they may speak with Your wisdom, providing solace without diminishing the sacredness of grief. Guide their actions so that they may be practical expressions of Your love—meals prepared, errands run, and hands held during the silent moments when hearts are heavy.

 

Sustain them, O Lord, when they feel the weight of shared sorrow. Renew their spirits that they may not grow weary in their compassion. Fill them with Your light, that it may shine through their deeds and bring warmth to chilled souls.

 

In moments of doubt, remind them that they are vessels of Your divine presence. Encourage them with the knowledge that in every act of kindness, they reflect Your love and hope. Grant them the understanding to respect each unique journey through the valley of shadows and the wisdom to know when to speak and when to sit in silent solidarity.

 

We ask for Your grace to envelop these caregivers so they may continue to walk alongside those who mourn, bearing the beacon of Your unfailing love. May they be assured that their labor of love plants seeds of healing that will bloom in Your perfect timing.

 

In Your Holy Name, we pray,

 

Amen.

dumb cruise control:
- ???-2016

intelligent cruise control (ICC) - adjust to speed of car in front using radar (doesn't come to complete stop I think?):
- 2017

propilot assist 1.0 - basic lane assist on highways and well painted roads. on my 2019, I've noticed it needs a little confidence (user input) to work on twisty highways, haven't tested but should come to complete stop
- 2018-2020

propilot assist 1.1 - different UI, improved lane assist reliability. test drive in 2023 on highway felt it took mild turns better than 1.0 (haven't tested twisty highways yet), supposed to be able to follow vehicle ahead in stop-go traffic:
- 2021-2024

propilot assist 2.0 - idk I can't buy an Ariya lol
- Ariya only

propilot assist 2.1 - didn't test drive long, the actual driving felt similar to 2023 except I could take my hands off for longer. has Google maps/assistant and Alexa integration without phone too, the below link looks helpful
- 2025-???

this looks cross posted to many dealership sites: https://www.walsernissancoonrapids.com/nissan-propilot-assist-everything-you-need-to-know/


all in all, I'm mostly after reliable lane assistance so if I had to conservatively upgrade from the 2019, id mainly look at propilot 1.1 and (big) maybe add in navi link for the additional speed adjust by route (assuming that means it'll take curves better). for me, the only next meaningful upgrade would be full on Tesla bringing me to work while I make cupholder coffee and take a nap

p.s.: when checking Nissan channel videos, I only looked for UI changes between the model years and assumed that's when the propilot version changed

1. **Plan Ahead**: Create a to-do list for the week with specific tasks and deadlines.
2. **Highlight Key Notes**: Focus on what’s most likely to be on the test. Prioritize big concepts over small details.
3. **Use Flashcards**: Apps like Quizlet make it easy to study anywhere—even in line for coffee!
4. **Study with Friends**: Group discussions can help clarify tough topics (just don’t turn it into a gossip sesh).
5. **Stay Hydrated**: A water bottle by your side is your secret weapon. Your brain works better when hydrated.
6. **Sleep Matters**: Pulling an all-nighter might seem heroic, but 7-8 hours of sleep beats exhaustion every time.
7. **Unplug for a While**: No distractions = more focus. Try airplane mode for an hour.

You want to learn to paint with the most respected artist in town. Welcome to my studio, this is a very important position you've landed yourself in, my dear friend. Now that you've had your morning coffee in the rest area we have here, and hopefully had a few social encounters, you're probably standing in front of your desk in your studio room. I'd like you to pay close attention to the rules and regulations of painting here as to not.... Disturb any of our processes.

RULE 1: The first things to do are as follows in this order. Not following the order might mess something up in our system.
1A: Open the bottom drawer and remove all your brushes and the water canister.
1B: set up a paper towel as to not get any paint where it doesn't belong
1C: you will hear a squishing sound behind the middle drawer, ignore it, wait until you hear someone give you the OK to open it, then a fresh can of paint will be in there. Remove it and place it upon your desk
1D: get a canvas from the top drawer and place it on the easel.

RULE 2: We only have red color paints to encourage creativity, making more with less is what will prove you worthy of your title of a true artist. If you see no paint in the drawer nothing is wrong, we have just ran out of our regular paint and none of it is left to dispose of. Take a break while we get more, come back in 20 minutes, we need you to use your paints! If you don't, we will be very disappointed in you.

RULE 3: Use all the paint you are given, I'm sure you will end up creating a masterpiece with our various crimson hues, however, although we make a lot of money harvesting your paintings and selling them, we don't want you to waste our paint! There should be none left for anyone to find! Not even a drop! Never be afraid to ask for more, just ask and wait to be given the ok to open the middle drawer and get some more.

RULE 4: If you ever disappoint us by breaking one of the strict rules of our beautiful studio, come down to my office, located at the front of the building, you are worth a lot to us and we can see that you are stressed, strap into the seat and take a guided tour of the art made here through my office. You have a lot of useful things inside you, and our friendly workers in the exhibits will help take them out of you in a constructive way! You may even be just like some of the painters in those exhibits one day!

RULE 5: If you hear any noises such as yelling or screaming from the exhibits, lock the door of your studio and keep painting, ignore it no matter how much it may seem, people enjoy the paintings we've made very much and it invokes such great emotion in them.

RULE 6:, When you are done making your masterpiece let it dry and put it onto the conveyer belt to your left, ignore the heat coming from it, we are making sure your painting is fully dried and any residue of the paint is fully cleared and cannot be noticed by anybody. 

RULE 7: During your final day in the studio come enjoy the exhibits if you haven't already, they're nice and beautiful! If you wish to renew your painting job just go to your studio! However if you don't we'd love to meet you in the exhibits to wish you a goodbye! You are worth so much! It's always what's  on the inside that counts to us, so come celebrate with us, don't make a mess with the spare paint in there though!

That's a wrap with our rules for the studio! We hole you'll love dribbling the crimson paints down the canvas, and we hope someday you'll be memorialized in these paintings forever! Now you may start painting, connoisseur!",2,1735566045.0,Ruleshorror,1,1.0,False

His mom who is a single mom to two boys and who I get along with well has recently asked my husband to have a one on one dinner with her once a month. I don’t want to give away our exact careers because I don’t want to give my identity away but let’s just say my husband works overnights Monday-Friday and I work days from 7:30-4. By the time I get home from work my husband is already gone for work and so really the only time I have to spend time with him is Saturday when he wakes up and Sunday all day. So really that’s 8 dinners a month. I’m pretty annoyed that his mom being very much aware of her son’s and DIL’s schedule is asking to take away yet another evening from my husband. It would be different if I was invited to these dinners. I feel like this is a big ask when we as husband and wife barely get time together and to eat together. Heck even if I was invited I would be a bit annoyed that 25% of our time we get as husband and wife were spent with his mother. Let alone me not being invited. I feel like his mom isn’t being understanding of our time together and is causing issues in our marriage. I feel it’s weird that she wants to plan monthly dinners every month where her son has to tell his wife, “sorry I’m having dinner/going out to eat with my mom but you aren’t invited.”

And yes I totally get she was a single mom who raised two boys and that’s amazing and she is a great woman and we get alone well however as bad as this might make me sound I don’t feel like that gives her the right knowing our strict schedules to monopolize so much of his time and not invite his wife to these dinners. Yes my husband and I together about 3-4 times a year will take her out and treat her bc of all she has done for my husband growing up and to show our appreciation. Sometimes on Saturdays here and there we will stop by. I also am not a parent so I completely understand the desire to have alone time with your child so sometimes on Sunday mornings my husband will pop over alone to say hi or for coffee. But to have a routine dinner plan where your child’s spouse is excluded if hurtful. I’m also hurt that his mother knowing our schedule would try and take the little time we have together away especially considering she seems to like me a lot and we get along well. 

My husband is annoyed as well but does struggle with setting boundaries at times and saying no to his mother. A habit I’m trying to break him out of. I feel like as his wife my feelings should be coming first especially with the little time we get together. I’m very annoyed that his mom is trying to monopolize so much of my husband’s time.

TLDR; My husband 32 (M) and I 32 (F) have been married 4 years and work completely opposite schedules so barely see each other and his mom wants him to have dinner alone with her where I’m not invited one day a month when we already only get 2 dinners a week together as husband and wife.",1,1735565667.0,u_EscapeWild3132,0,1.0,False

Being stuck in Valen for the better part of a decade had dulled some of Falor’s old instincts while sharpening others. If he were honest with himself, he’d admit that he’d grown somewhat paranoid in the city. This was especially true after the Crepuscular invasion of his private chamber…

Even so, it was normal precaution—it wasn’t—to spread out a net of early warning whenever they rested. Every animal rutting about and every plant moved by the rain plucked at the strands of power and send a jolt of awareness up his back. It made him cranky with lack of sleep, but it was better than no warning at all.

*I’m not being paranoid.* He’d repeated it to himself enough times now that it came as wonderful relief when more than just normal forest life triggered his senses.

There were other travellers! They were nearby. And…

*They’re keeping to themselves. I’m being ridiculous.* One had climbed a tree and surveyed the general area. It was a good vantage point. Falor turned and looked at the peeking treetop, but could see no one in the crown. He was almost tempted to jolt the person just to signal mutual awareness, but thought better of it.

He wasn’t the only paranoid in the forest.

Barlo poured him a cup of coffee and grumbled something Falor couldn’t make out. He scalded his mouth and throat on the first sip and his attention was drawn away from the observer.

They would break camp and get some more distance today, now the rain was finally easing off. Quis had grumbled of her boots ever since leaving Valen, and it didn’t seem likely she would be any happier now.

They all sat around a small burner and waited for another mug of coffee to warm up.

Something triggered his senses and make him choke on his scalding drink. Violence! Sudden and bloody. In the direction of their earlier observers. They ran against something big and hungry it seemed.

He grabbed his hammer, whistled a short warning call, and took off in the direction of the clash. He couldn’t feel exactly what sort of creature it was that was attacking, but it was large and mean.

Barlo overtook him heartbeats later, crashing through the underbrush like a charging ox. He didn’t so much cross the forest as convince it to be somewhere out of his way. He cut right past Falor, disappeared into the thicket, and heartbeats later the angry, unmistakable roar of a gold-tongue reverberated through the air.

“Glory hog,” Falor spat through gritted teeth.

There were more. He skidded to a halt, slipping in the mud and nearly falling over. He grabbed Vial’s arm as the soldier appeared, and pointed him in a different direction.

“That way, go,” he urged. “There’s more fighting in that direction.” Two people, at least, and one more animal. He dropped the weave, its constant thrumming having turned into a distraction.

Quis joined him a heartbeat later. Barlo was fighting somewhere ahead. Falor felt his help would be quite wasted there if the vanadal wasn’t whistling for support. Instead he sent a pulse in the general direction of the fighting and received back a quick heartbeat.

“Give a woman some warning.” Quis also slipped in the mud. He caught her before she fell.

“Someone’s hurt,” he said without preamble. “Come on.”

And sure enough, there was Barlo, climbed astride one of the largest gold-tongue drakes Falor had ever seen outside of Aztroa Magnor’s mountain vastness. It was missing one eye and bleeding profusely from the wound. It was snarling and snapping angrily at the sudden weight atop its neck.

Barlo had mounted in across the head and was now busy driving the feral thing into a frenzy with blows to its thick skull. He’d yet to draw a sword but was, instead, pulling hard on the arm-thick bone spikes protruding out of its head, managing to get it to turn in place. It went into a tree-shattering roll but the vanadal held on grimly.

“In the bushes,” he called out as the drake came out of its roll and whipped its head about. It slammed into another tree trunk, Barlo having to move aside or be crushed. Rain water cascaded down from above. “There’s a girl in the bushes.”

Falor sent the pulse again and got a quicker location. They found the drake’s victim sprawled underneath a thorny thicket, face down in the mud, trying to crawl. It was a woman, wearing what looked like bloody light leather armour. He reached over and dragged her up to rest against a tree.

Quistis let out a soft gasp at the sight of her. She went immediately to work.

Falor let her to it and rushed to Barlo’s aid.

“It’s a mother,” Barlo said as the drake kept whipping him around even as he tried to drag its head to the side. “Got young. Why it hunts here. Bloody. Big.” The vanadal’s voice came in bursts that would have been comedic in another situation. The situation was quickly turning into a matter of life and death as the mother drake grew increasingly irate and destructive. It rolled around, smashed into trees, tried to claw at her head.

“Fine mount you chose there, Barlo,” Falor called. “Trying to break it?”

“It’s trying to break me,” the warrior argued, laughing all the while. “Lil’ help?”

Falor was already closing in. The drake, too maddened to notice him, kept at thrashing and rolling, swiping with its great talons.

*Such a beautiful specimen. Such a shame to kill it for nothing.*

Lightning coiled around his arms and descended to the hammer. *Too much.* He pulled back some of his strength as Barlo whistled.

The vanadal rode out the anger amid the gold-tongue’s horns. He dropped fully in a riding position just behind the drake’s head. His sudden drop pushed the head down and Barlo dug his heels into the ground and lifted the head by the horns. It was a moment of shock for the beast, to be staggered like this.

Falor swung the hammer and cracked it into the monster’s temple. He shattered one of its main black horns and sent it reeling to the side, head lolling, tongue flicking out.

It rumbled and let out a whimpered gasp as he spun the hammer again and hit it right between the eyes. He held back from a killing blow, instead sending a weak pulse of lightning into the monster’s wounds.

It dropped to the forest floor with a thud and a deep exhalation. Barlo unmounted and jumped aside.

“Best we got movin’ before it comes to its senses. ‘Less ya wanna kill’it?”

Falor didn’t want that, no. It was a beautiful animal hunting for food, and some travellers hadn’t been careful enough with their tramping about the forest. He wouldn’t kill it for the sport of it.

He retreated to where Quis was helping the woman to her feet.

“Is she alright?” he asked.

“She’ll be fine with a bloodberry tonic. Just got a bad knock. She’ll remember it.”

Barlo joined them and let out a soft harrumph. “Long way from Valen, elendine,” he said without preamble.

Falor’s eyebrow rose.

“Stow discussions for later. You two, find Vial and help him if need be. Regroup at camp.”

Quis’s eyes flashed for a moment between him and the girl.

“What? Didn’t the heal catch?”

“Ah, no. It… she’s fine.” Quis glanced at the elendine once more, then jogged after Barlo. Falor caught a tendril of doubt coming off her, but it was quickly snuffed out.

“Who… who are you?” the girl asked in a quiet voice, looking about at the rousing shape of the drake.

“Someone who’s helping. Come. It’ll be on its feet any moment now.” He took two steps back and beckoned to her.

Barlo had been right. This was an elendine. Blood red hair spilled out of her head covering in thick locks to frame a sweet, suspicious face. Her clothes were torn and, like her, covered in blood and mud but Barlo had recognised her. And so had Quistis.

“You are… miss Mergara, yes?” he asked dubiously as she looked ready to bolt the other way. “I don’t want to hurt you. My name is Falor. Please follow me. I really don’t want to kill that gold-tongue if I don’t need to, so I’d rather we move away. Our camp is nearby.”

Well, that did the opposite of what he’d hoped. Her eyes widened and she looked sharply to the side, fear pulsing off her as strong as a beacon. “My… my friend…” she muttered.

“My men are helping them. There’s no reason to be afraid. Please, come.”

The gold-tongue let out whine and it roused, head shaking off the blow. Falor had hit it hard enough that it failed the first time, legs jelly underneath it. It managed to half-rise only to fall on its side, hissing.

Finally, the elendine moved. She took a step forward Falor and he led her away down the trail Barlo had cut. Their camping spot was just a short jaunt away through the underbrush, thanks to the vanadal’s straight-line approach to navigation.

He heard the gold-tongue hiss and stomp away, trees creaking as it leaned against them. It wouldn’t bother them again.

The tents lay scattered about, half-way into the process of being stowed away when the commotion happened.

Nonetheless, he fished out a canteen of water from the sodden stash and handed it over to the quiet elendine. “Drink. You’ve lost blood. Quis will prep you a bloodberry once she’s back. You’re safe now.”

Fear still pulsed off the girl as she skittishly took the canteen from his hands. She surveyed the forest for a long time before drinking. He waited for her to finish but did not reach for the canteen. Was she in shock after the tussle with the drake? She must’ve been, since she nearly jumped out of her skin when the forest rustled again.

The man who walked in next to Barlo had Falor craning his neck to look up into his face. When the report had described the smith Toh’uhm as a *human-looking demi of impressive height*, this was not what he had assumed upon reading it. The smith was as massive as Barlo and about half-a-head taller. He rushed straight for the elendine and kneeled next to her, as if to a child.

“Are you alright?” he asked in an urgent tone. There were deep gashes on his back, as if he’d also been ambushed and rolled through the mud. Quis tried to see to him, but he wasn’t paying her any mind.

“I’m fine, Tummy,” the elendine said quietly. “They… saved me.”

“Where’s the third?” Falor asked as Vial also joined them in the tight clearing.

He shook his head, then looked at the two travellers. “Didn’t see any third.”

“It’s just us,” the elendine said, perhaps a touch too quickly. “You said *friends* earlier, but it’s just me and Tummy.”

He frowned at that. He was certain he’d felt a third presence as well in the forest, as vital as anything. It had also been poking about their outside of their camp, but generally out of reach of his immediate senses. *It could have been an animal scouting, I suppose.*

His paranoia scoffed at the idea but he pushed it away. There was no reason to immediately suspect anything, so this got filed away for later consideration. Now that the crisis was over, he’d see about weaving his net again when they stopped farther on.

“Far from Valen, smith,” Barlo rumbled as he came to stand next to the couple.

*That’s odd,* part of Falor observed. *She’s in charge. He’s waiting for instruction.* Something was passing between the two, though he couldn’t immediately make it out in the subtle language of their gestures. It woke a particular memory in the back of his mind, one of his mother. He’d study it later.

“Thaw’s here,” the smith said. “We’re out for supplies.”

Barlo cracked a short bark of laugh at that. “Hunting yer own leather? And here th’ commander let tha’ biggun get away.”

It was the smith’s turn to smile. “Not the leather. We’re on our way t’ Garet. Need good steel.”

“Iron road’s safer than the forest,” Falor said.

Quis was being uncharacteristically quiet about the whole thing. That set him on guard. Whenever she got suspicious of something, it was generally for good reason.

“Drink this,” she handed a bloodberry to the elendine. “Follow up with water. It’ll make you thirsty for a day or so. Drink whenever you feel the need to.”

“Safer, but crowded in thaw,” the smith answered, pulling himself up to his full height. “Lots of people travelling now th’ passes are open. Wouldn’t be a problem to the Storm Guard, though.”

Falor heard the unspoken *‘Why are you out here?’* question and decided not to answer. He couldn’t fault the two their suspicion, given the mess they’d been subjected to in Valen. He recalled more details from Quis’s reports.

How would this look from their point of view?

Travelling through the back roads only to find themselves in the company of the people who had taken the elendine from her home, marched her past some very suggestive gallows, and then interviewed her relentlessly for an entire night. Only to then send her home with a soldier on her back. Who then nearly died on their doorstep.

*Oh, and we’ve drugged her with summer wasp venom. Wonder if she ever figured that one out.*

If it were him, he’d also be wary of this meeting. And it didn’t help that, in spite of saving her life, the elendine regarded him with as much distrust as he’d ever seen from someone.

“Alright,” he said finally. “May I suggest we start this conversation over?” He turned to the elendine and approached, pulling off his gloves and offering his hand. “I am Commander Falor Merchal of the Storm Guard, Primary Division. And I,” he cast a glare at Barlo and Quistis, “feel I owe you an apology, Mertle Mergara. What my men did in Valen was inexcusable in spite of our suspicions at the time. I can only apologise on their behalf.”

The elendine stared up at him and, reluctantly, took his hand. “Apology accepted, Commander Falor.” She held his hand for a long time and looked him dead in the eye. “My Sil is not who your men said she is. If you want to apologise, promise me you won’t hurt her if you find her.”

Ah. This. Cinder’s was this elendine’s lover. On physical contact he normally had a better understanding of the person’s state of mind. He’d expected fear and suspicion out of the elendine. What burned in her was a fierce determination that took him by surprise. She wasn’t afraid of him, but wary of his actions. He got a flash of a complicated lattice of instinct and preparation that rebuffed any other prodding.

He sighed and let go of her hand. “I cannot and will not make a promise I may be forced not to keep in the future. I will not lie for convenience’s sake.”

She glowered at him but relented soon after, turning the glare onto Quis instead. “She did promise she’ll get me news. At least that, I assume, wasn’t a lie.” The tone was absolutely venomous.

Quis looked at him pleadingly. Now, the air of the conversation began to clear for him.

“Alright, alright, that is neither here nor now. I’m certain we will cross paths with Cinder in the future and things will run their course. I can only hope your… Sil will choose to do the right thing.”

“Agreed,” the smith rumbled. He poked Mertle in the shoulder. “This is rude. They may have saved your life.”

“I would’ve been fine,” she answered petulantly.

“Not likely,” Barlo said as he took to dismantling and packing his large tent. Vial, unusually quiet as well, went to help.

Mertle poked her tongue out at their back.

Quis came to stand next to Falor and looked at the two. “Well, since we’re all travelling pretty much in the same direction, may I suggest you join us?”

“You’re heading to Garet?” the smith asked.

“No, but we will pass by it. Our goal’s farther out.”

“Aztroa then?”

Quis shook her head. “No. But you are welcome to accompany us to Garet. Safety in numbers.” She added a smile and went on, meeting Mertle’s gaze. “Not that I’m not certain you would manage perfectly fine on your own.”

Mertle and the smith—Toh’Uhm… how did one pronounce that?—shared a look and nodded to one another. Falor remembered Barlo speaking of sharing drinks with the man. Not many could drink with Barlo and come back for more.

“If I may ask,” he said. “How do I pronounce your name, smith?”

“Don’t try to,” he answered with a rumbling chuckle. “I’m Tummy. Thank you for your help, Commander Falor. It was about to get ugly.”

They shook hands and again he was struck by the kind of determination he felt flowing off the man. The direction of it was a fuzzy thing that Falor couldn’t distinguish in the carefully guarded feelings, but it seemed to be focused on Mertle. Barlo’s earlier estimate of the two—that they were an aelir’matar’s runaway thralls—seemed quite possible. Even at a glance he could notice Tummy’s ears had been rounded with a blade at some point, the wounds left to heal on their own. At once a mark of shame, and of ownership.

“Right then. We’re aiming for the old miller’s road,” he said as the other two finished striking down the camp. He opened a rend and they carried supplies inside. “You can stow your supplies with ours if you’d like to travel lighter.”

Tummy shook his head as he hefted the large backpack and handed Mertle hers. They were both muddy head to toe, but it was beginning to drizzle again. They’d be cleaner in a short while.

“It was our plan too,” Mertle said. “Heard it’s safer than these back roads.”

“That’s a matter of opinion,” Quis said. “We’ve had plenty of reports coming in over the seasons of banditry in the area. We were about to test some of those rumours and see if we can’t curb the issue while it’s in our way.”

“Just the four of you?”

“Just the Commander if he sets his mind to it. We’re just going to make sure he leaves someone alive so we can gather more intel.”

“You make me sound like a monster, Quis,” Falor protested. “I am perfectly reasonable to men who surrender.”

“And to those who don’t?” Mertle asked, a raised eyebrow needling his answer.

“Then I am pretty much what Quis describes, yes.”

There was no point in pretending silk gloves. The elendine had been marched right past the executions *he* had ordered, and that woman had screamed herself hoarse above the Agora for several days on end. Granted, that had been Rumi’s doing, but he’d signed off on it.

He shook his head to the look of horrified fascination on Mertle’s face. “Anyway, you are welcome to travel with us for now. We can part ways in Garet.”

A final pulse of power across the forest floor before they set out. There was, again, that answer, as if someone was nearby but not quite. Cinder had taught him to trust his gut if instinct warned him of anything suspicious. But he hadn’t sensed anything from either of the two, and this response was just barely there, like a shadow.

Part of him wished it was, indeed, a shadow. Or, more precisely, a particular Crepuscular that had eluded him in Valen.

The woman would either be stupid or insane to follow him.

He reeled in the power, hefted his hammer onto his shoulder, and they set out among the trees. It had grown warmer but the skies remained a milky white above, the mist hanging thick between the trees. They would all remain sodden and miserable for a while longer.

“Permission to sing a tune, Commander?” Vial called from the back of the line.

“Denied,” both he and Quis answered. They had accepted once and both had sworn never to repeat that mistake ever again.

“Permission to hum a tune?” the soldier asked more hopeful.

“Suit yourself, Vial. If you draw some gold-tongue to you, we’re letting it keep you,” Falor said, concealing a smile.

“I could do with some new armour. Is drake hide good for armour, lady elendine?”

They were marching with Barlo as their vegetation breaker, leading the column. Falor walked together with Quis behind the vanadal, and at their back came Tummy and Mertle. Vial was the last in line.

“Drake hide needs a long time to cure,” the elendine said. “It can be made into great armour if you invest the time to prepare it properly, but many of the trappers in Valen just destroy the best parts. It’s a shame, really.”

“Fancy that. Can I get the claws onto a pair of gloves? Would be wicked.”

Mertle laughed. It was a pleasant sound. “I did that once. Was a commission. Resulted in an absolutely crap pair of gloves and a wasted tenday for myself.”

Tummy rumbled a laugh next to her. “Spent days drilling holes in those claws so she’d sew them onto the gloves. They ripped the fingers right off the first time we tested it. Waste of time.”

“Tummy can make you some great daggers out of drake claws, if you want,” Mertle went on, growing excited as she spoke. “He once made me a bone dagger that weighed a quarter of what my steel ones do. I could throw it across the Agora and hit the apple atop the Gooseberry.”

Falor took all in all they said and his mind raced, an inkling of suspicion needling at him. He really had no right to pry into their lives, especially given everything else that had happened after the Descent, but he had to ask.

“Why did you leave Nen?”

They both clamped up with a silence that chilled the air. He almost felt it on the back of his neck, hairs standing on end. It passed almost as quick as it had come and Mertle was first to answer, “We owed money. They wanted to collect. In… particular fashion.” The last words were poisonous on her tongue. “We stowed away on a ship and crossed the Divide. We are *not* going back.”

He sighed and turned to her. What was the gesture for apology in elend culture? It had been a long time since his lessons in Aztroa. He touched the index and middle fingers of his right hand to his lips, then to his right temple. *I have spoken poorly and will remember my error.*

Mertle stared at him and nodded slowly. She answered in kind, same fingers to the temple, then hand raised and finger splayed out. *Your words will not weigh on me.* “I wasn’t aware you knew our custom,” she said afterwards, smiling in what Falor hoped was genuine fashion.

“Well… it pays to learn of everyone that’s come to live in the Empire. I did not mean to pry or riffle any unpleasant memories. Curiosity got the better of me.”

This had been the first true lie Mertle had spoken to him. He’d felt it on the air. Not the falseness of the words, but the fabricated conviction behinds them. Earlier, she’d been truthful in as much as his poorly-practices sense reading could determine, but that could be faked by someone with the right training.

This had a different taste to the words, a different shape of the belief. It was something grown and practised for a long, long time.

Mertle had expertly demonstrated what his mother had spent half of his life teaching him to recognise.

Barlo’s intuition had been nearly right. They were runaways from the aelir Dominion, but they weren’t thralls. Without having served the aelir, he couldn’t even know the likes of them even existed. You’d need to have been trained as one, or taught to recognise the signs by someone like his mother.

This is a long story, so hope to get some insight/feedback for those who can stick with me.

Canadian here. For what it's worth.

As a note, I've always had bad ear problems, even as a kid. Had tubes in them as a baby. I also have sleep apnea now. 35 years old, male. Work from home so not super active other than I had been going to a crossfit gym for nearly 2 years twice a week and had to stop once BPPV hit.

I first got a vertigo episode November 6th.  It has happened maybe twice in my life over the last 3-4 years but no long term affects that I recall at all. Didn't think anything of this and had another episode on November 10th. Note: Both BPPV episodes were when I woke up sleeping on my back on a single pillow (I almost always use two pillows - an older/flat pillow and another newer pillow) and am a side sleeper, but on ccasion will wake up on my back and sometimes just on one pillow.  
  
Felt all the usual symptoms and ended up going to the emergency room in my small town. After some blood tests, blood pressure test, and a few basic tests with the doctor, he told be I had BPPV caused by an inner ear infection and provided be a prescription for Betahistine Dihydrocl - 8MG. Took 3 a day with every meal. Was also told to try Epley/brandt daroff but found it didn't seem to do anything? I didn't get dizzy and since I didn't have a proper diagnoisis I never did it again. Was told just a couple weeks I should be better.

Fast forward to November 11th and I still wasn't feeling much better and while it hasn't quite yet been a couple weeks, I was so riddled with anxiety I ended up going to see a doctor at a walk-in clinic in my town. Doctor did the same basic tests and concured it was BPPV from an inner ear infection, encouraged me that I had to wait longer but to book an appointment with my family doctor as he noted my ears were quite bad/full of wax. This walk-in clinic doctor said I should NOT do Epley if I didn't notice it work the first time until I check with an ENT to confirm what might be causing the BPPV as to not make things worse

Some tips I had been given were continue taking the Betahistine, move slow when getting up from bed, etc. I also completely cold turkey cut coffee, soda, and basically all beverages except water (and water enhancing mio sport for electrolytes). Only thing I haven't been super aware of is sodium intake.

At first I began to sleep on my sides with two pillows under my head and a body pillow at the back to ensure I couldn't roll over. However as I wasn't sure what was happening I would switch back and forth between what side I slept on.

At some point during this I started doing some amount of research online and found inner ear infections causing BPPV were often either labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis. I saw tips I didn't get from the doctor like taking vitamin D3/K2 as that is potentially linked to BPPV, I started taking magnesium, advil when I had headaches a couple times a day, and also have been taking Melatonin for the last 5 weeks - I know it is bad to take it longer than 2-3 months at max so want to slowly get off of it if I can.

I also learned sleeping propped up on your back is the best way to drain fluid from ears and as I had no tinnitius and no ear pain, I didn't know which ear was affected. My sister had an old foam wedge 10.5"" roughly in size (no memory foam, just a yellow/super basic old wedge). I had began to use that and even used a folded up sheet to provide slightly more comfort for my head. At first I couldn't get used to it so I went on Amazon to purchase another wedge that was 7.5"" tall without realizing it was smaller. Upon receiving it I was very worried about sleeping on it as I was concerned I wouldn't be elevated enough to avoid the BPPV. 

I immediatedly purchased a 10.5"" memory foam wedge pillow and it was as tall as the one my sister gave me but found myself not being able to sleep on it. Felt my neck was at a weird angle compared to my head and anxiety started to kick in as memory foam pillows were the type of pillow I originally woke up on when I had my vertigo episodes. 

I keep telling myself it's not the memory foam itself but the angle I was sleeping at, but my anxiety is still bad. I got about 4-5 nights sleeping using the smaller wedge with a pillow on top but anxiety had be concerned that it was throwing my neck/spine out of position which could make it worse so I stopped.

On December 9th I finally got an over-the-phone appointment with my family doctor. He booked me for an appointment to have my ears cleaned out (coming up on Jan 2nd)and told me to use room temperature mineral oil on each ear, 4 hours between doing each ear leading up to the appointment to soften the wax. He also renwed by Betahistine prescription to 16MG (originally 8MG). Been taking it since twice daily as doctor said I may not need to take it 3 times a day due to it being stronger. He encouraged me to DO Epley.

He referred me to an ENT in the next town over but due to our area having long wait times and the holiday, he's ""not sure"" how long until I hear from them about an appointment. I am going to check Jan 2nd when I get my ears checked that he indeed got my referral into the ENT.

As time went on leading up to Christmas I continued to use this old foam pillow for sleep but found it hurt the back of my head slightly (due to it being old/foam) and to some degree my back/neck, but it was the only way I could relax enough to get any sort of sleep. I continued to have good/bad days but overall continued to see improvement.

Over the last 2 nights however, this old foam wedge pillow has been preventing me from getting a full night sleep. I find throughout the night I lay awake, almost comatose but can't quite fall asleep so feel I am up often throughout the night. It also has casued pain in my lower/mid back (possibly not enough support as it's an old wedge). 

I'm beginning to be sleep deprived over the last couple of days and in fact feel like I am slightly REGRESSING and feel the dizziness/instability getting slightly worse.

I want to go back and try sleeping on my side as I would imagine 7 weeks after originally getting vertigo, if it was an ear infection, it should be safe to assume there's no more ""affected"" ear as the infection should be gone by now and this is all just reisidual?

Not sure if anyone else is struggling with sleep as that's my biggest hurdle. Do folks have success going back to sleeping as normal after some time? Continue to struggle/get used to sleeping on my back on the taller wedge? Use a pillow on a wedge (though multiple things online say not to do this).

I'm the type of person who feels better getting feedback from others and it will help me feel better on how to best get back to getting proper sleep.

Thanks for reading everyone!

I would be so excited to write something “that the Holy Spirit told me” down in the early morning (think 5 am) that I wouldn’t even brush my teeth until like 12 pm. 

At one point I drank 10 cups of tea while doing some Bible studies. 

I didn’t go out. Partly because of my parents and because I was toooo invested in my studies! I’d just go to coffee shops, but I stopped keeping track of what’s going on in my area. I’d get invited to things, but the whole time I’d be thinking “I can’t wait to go back to my studies.” 

I’d freak out if I couldn’t make a post at the same exact time that I normally would. It was almost like the Holy Spirit would be put to shame if I failed…

I made EVERYTHING about god. Every single conversation I had. 

When I began to question (which happened early on), I’d cry nearly every day because I didn’t want to be separated from god. 

I surrounded myself with fundamentalist believers so nobody saw it as a problem. I was encouraged to just white knuckle and push it. How scary to think. I would’ve encouraged the same thing. 

Things amped up when I thought there were demons everywhere. It was probably the adventure I craved since I wasn’t going anywhere. It was also scary and weird. Everything had to be cleansed. 

I didn’t let anyone close because if they’d disagree on even 0.01% of theology, I’d see them as evil. And yet I’d 100% trust anyone who seemed to be on the same page.

But over this year I've been judge by my friends and my dad for liking K-pop, and its so annoying. Today was the last straw.


(Backstory: In our living room we have these big speakers where you can just sit down and put on some music. My dad always sits there and listen to his type of music: rock, country, and more.)


Today it was a normal day as usual. My dad wakes up, makes coffee, and sits down on the couch in the living room and puts on some music. After like 30 he decides to go on a walk and I see my chance to put on my type of music (K-pop). He then comes back after 15-20 minutes and starts complaining about how loud and annoying type off music i listen to, and then he tells me: ""You should listen to other types off music that you actually understand, and thats more normal to listen to""

Excuse me? I don't always need to understand what they're singing about, in my opinion all that matters to me is just the presence off K-pop that makes me happy, makes me smile, and keeps me alive. 
(Obviously I listen to other type off music but I like and listen to kpop the most.)

When he said that I turned off the music and walked back to my room and hopped into my bed. He ruined my perfectly happy mood. I dont know if I overreacted or not, but it hurts when the people you have closest doesn't support what you like.

Hello fellow foodies,

Coming in from ATX today for a baby moon. 

Staying downtown at the US Grant and wanting to get any recs for food. We're here M-Sa and have done 0 investigation for brunch / lunch / coffee but focused on dinners before coming. She's still super mobile so we're walking as much as possible. 

Since the wife can't drink the cocktail or bar vibe is a mute point. Seafood has been super hit or miss for her while pregnant. Otherwise we love anything and will try everything once.

We'll be in Coronado one day and La Jolla another if anything in either is worth it. Outside of the zoo we don't have much planned away from downtown but are open to an uber if its can't miss.

So far I have a dinner resi at:
Barbusa,
Bencotta,
Mabels,
Cowboy star 

Being from TX we're probably good passing on the mexi and BBQ scene unless something here is that comparable.

Pulled most of these from past threads
Thanks y'all!

1hpmnt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatingexposed/comments/1hpmnt3/boyfriend_butt_dialed_me_while_he_was_getting/,boyfriend butt dialed me while he was getting massage happy ending ,"

 32F been dating 33M for six plus years. ive posted on other subreddit about possible cheating. I think I was in denial for couple years. especially now that I gather evidence.

  


last 4th of July at cookout, I planned to sneak on his phone and snoop through it, my gut feeling told me check. at first I didnt really find any damaging evidence, he broke some trust in the past that didnt exactly label him "" cheater"" but a girl PM me on FB telling me he is being weird and shady, screenshot it and sent to me. I was respectful toward her and thanked her. the messages didnt say anything that would come across flirty, but he was trying to engage in convo where she wasnt interested in to talking to him , pretty much two word answer. I forgave him even though thinking back he didnt apologize .

  


well 4th July I snooped , I went through deleted text messages phone a unknown numbers with asian "" massage parlors"" some of the text was asking how much for an hour for special massage, or what the VIP give, I screenshot them texts , google the numbers found the addresses is known for sexual favors on rubmap on the web, I didnt know if I should confront him... because I did snoop in his phone, I disregard his privacy to get this info. so I kept it filed in the back of my head.

  


well its December , I think December 19 it was a Saturday... well we were at mall plaza late Christmas shopping. we go to the last stop to get a gift , I was in a great mood and happy to be with him that day...well I stayed in the car and his phone is there, I know the passcode. he doesnt hide it from me. well he went into the restaurant to get a gift card. I snoop through his phone go to deleted text. I see two or three unknown numbers with massage for 60-90 min for amount of money .I see the date stamp December 6 and another from November . I see him asking if they do four hand special or if they will sit on his face, or if they can wear cat woman leathers , some shit like that. I was peeved off. I was cold and distant the rest of the day. I wanted to to the Christmas Eve party and have fun with his family.. I wanted to pretend everything was fine. I haven't really been affectionate or say I love you . when im upset I cant bring myself to say sweet things . I am still in denial , I wrote again to subreddits asking for advice. some people read my older post thought I was troll, or seeking attention. I am not trying to seek attention ,or trying to troll people . be bot. I am really confuse about my trusting my instincts, confused on what is considered cheating? because some people dont think getting a happy endings at massage parlor is "" cheating"""" plus some people thought he was just trolling the scammer . but after today s recent events ..... I am convince he's been doing this for months maybe years .

  


its Sunday its been a couple hours since he dropped me off at house after getting coffees in the morning, I am home in bed doing my own thing, thinking he's on his way to Walmart or the gym. or his home... its 12:30 ish he butt dials me and I answer hello.. nothing then I hear asian accent and his voice, I turn off my sound and video screen so he doesnt hear me or see me. his screen is dark.. I think it's in his pocket or something. I dont hang up...I recorded the call . I listen. If he is doing something sleazy I want proof... I dont want to be gaslit into think I misheard the call . I wait and listen . its mainly music and closing of doors. I finally hear it. there's not a lot of talking or noise , but the woman is saying stuff you are very handsome etc, then I hear him nervously ask can you sit on my face, and her ask if he was the towel on, he says keep it on twice, then I hear her moan and saying stuff like ya baby etc.

  


it was mainly quiet so I doubt it last much, maybe just massaging after that. but when he getting up to leave asking her if she working tonight and are they open til 9, that he maybe come again. she says she very busy all he says its okay. he tips her then pays upfront I assume . they saying goodbye before I hear a bell against a door.then I click the decline call button.

  


I didnt hear from him til 3pm

  


he texted me him: hi babe Me: what's up? how was your day? ( playing it cool)

  


him :its good just relaxing playing my game. how was your day going? me: all day? I dropped my nephew off at his friends and went on a walk. him : no I took a nap too and went grocery shopping, you went for a walk in the rain? me: its not raining here. when did you go shopping? ha you took a nap all day? him: Walmart , not all day. me: oh that's why I didnt hear from you til now, from 1-4.

  


him: I was also playing my game. me: when did you take a nap babe \*smile face\*?

  


him: around 1:30. ( mind you he was at the massage parlor from 12 til 1:46 him: did you take a nap, you were up early. me: no I was up. so from there it was boring convo but by the end of the night.

  


I knew if I ask him these questions about what he was doing Sunday afternoon , he straight up lie, and I have voice recording of him basically doing intimate physical stuff with another person. its not like a regular massage , he wants his kink fullful by person who is getting paid for it. idk what is worst to be cheated on like this if it was just a average girl or a paid prostitute , for some kind of arousal .

  


the last few text me : are you in a relaxing mood? him: yeah why? me : just wondering.. if you are in a good mood. him : right now I am. me: good , good. him : hbu ? me: not really. him : why ? me : ill tell you another day , are you going (his brothers) Tuesday (NYE ) him: oh okay, yeah are you gonna come with me? me: yeah. him: great \*smile face\*. me: will that make you happy? him: well yeah I like when we spend time together \*heart emoji\* me: Yeah I know how much you love me him: really? me: yup I know now how much you value me and how much you respect me \* blush smile emoji\* him : a lot, I gotta go charge my phone text you in a bit.

  


I haven't really cried about it. I think I am numb and relieved .... relieve that I was just insecure and looking for issues, that he's a good guy. that his ED is just a bump. that it must be me that he isn't attracted to me.he tells me he loves me , and he gets embarrassed about his ED.. that he does find me sexually attractive..he couldn't keep it up for more than couple minutes, and he doesnt know how to foreplay if he's arouse and wants sex he need to put it in fast , in the beginning I felt ashamed it must be me.. then I would beg basically for sex. we would go months with out it. or once or twice a month. but lately its not happening .. I stop asking. I stop trying to dress sexy, ive gain weight for health issues, stop feeling pretty. he didnt even like to make out.. some people think grown adult dont make out.. but he says it hurts his jaw for long periods, but its only for a few minutes. I kinda knew this relationship wasnt benefit anyone. I am not perfect , he isn't the villain. he's a good person. I think I held on mainly because I love his family, I felt like his family was my extension family.. I love his nephews and niece. they call me auntie ,I am hurt that I'll probably won't be in their lives much longer. I think the breakup will be harder on me because I am losing more out of it. he never really want to be my family, or wanted to try to make my own nephews his own. I would go to his nephews games with him because one he wanted to go, and I wanted to spend as much little time I had with my bf too and see his nephew baseball. would invite him to my nephews games , he never wanted to only went to two maybe .. he didnt even go to my grandmother funeral with me for support. he (supported me) couple days before her wake.. I even offer to buy him black shirt etc.when he said he doesnt have anything black nice shirts, then the day of he said doesnt feel comfortable going to funerals of people he doesnt know, his mother stop at the funeral parlor to pay her respects.. I appreciate that most of all.. a year later her husband died from cancer and I bought her a necklace in memory of him and I showed up at the wake , my bf didnt think I would want to go, or stay long. my parents stopped by and paid their respects.

  


I still hold some grudge over that. that he couldn't get over his discomfort of funerals of people he never really wanted to try to get to know. I stop inviting him to events, even though im not too close to family members, I am anxious person so I mainly didnt want my family to ask him when he's going to put a ring on it, or have kids.. which is a sore topic for me.

  


so its kinda funny he's lying for months maybe years on talking to other women, or going sex massage parlors ... that he's comfortable going to strangers for pleasure but uncomfortable sitting with me at a funeral to comfort me. its sad because my male cousin girlfriend who was FWB at the time went to the funeral/ wake . and she was sitting with me. its sucks .

  


I cant chicken out on breaking up with him, because I dont want to be alone.. or scared that I wasted my youth on him, that no man worthy would want me. because I dont value or respect myself. maybe that's why he did it. because he knew I was insecure and let people walk all over me. that I wouldn't put my foot down. I am so numb to it. deep inside I think I always expected betrayal. ive known other men who have cheated on their spouse or girlfriends , before him, I had guys who are in a relationship I didnt know before flirt with me and I find out blocked them.

  


I see people on social media in a goofy video with their bf or gf .. so happy and cute photoshoots, and proposal and having family . and I was never getting that .

  


sorry for the long post.

I (30m) met a girl (29f) in a common class earlier this year, at first I didn't think much of it, she was attractive but we talked only a little about the subject of the class. After a month or so, we randomly met at a party that she was attending with a friend that was visiting her, I hadn't notice her until she came to say hi, and we talked for a little bit, my friends mentioned that she might be interested in me (it's often difficult for me to pick up on these things) so I tried to talk more with her, she was friendly, but just that, at some point the subject of her boyfriend came up, so I knew nothing was going to happen . I saw her twice again in a short period of time, one time she was with her boyfriend. We stayed in touch as friends and classmates, sometimes texting about stuff related to uni, but nothing else. 

Around September she started texting more often and asking if I would like to go out drinking with her or if I had any plans of doing so on weekends, for various reasons we never coincided, until we set up a date and we talked over a couple of beers. I wasn't sure if it was just friendly chat or if something else was going on, I invited her to a party my friends were organizing, but she mentioned she had work and couldn't come, but she left the possibility open of going out again. We kept texting, but never set up anything again. 

A few weeks later, after the class we had in common, I was talking to another friend (also female) and she came over and started talking too, we all together decided to get a coffee and at that point she finally said she had just broken up with her boyfriend just that week and she was looking for social activities to keep her mind of off that stuff,she didn't give any more context, but that was a bit of a shock to me. We had met one of my friends in the Café and he was having his birthday that week, so he organized a bar crawl that friday, she heard that and asked if she could join, to which my friend said yes.

That Friday she joined late as she mentioned she was having a fight with her ex over the phone, she seemed a little agitated over it, but she started drinking and started talking to a friend and became calmer. At the end of that night we kissed, and I asked her if I could follow her home, she said no and I just went my own way. Next day I asked how she was feeling and she said that she needed to get away from everything, so she went to visit her male friend in the city.

We met in class the next week and she wasn't avoidant or anything,. I even made a joke about us having kissed and she reacted well. 

We went out in social situations again a few more times, after each of which we kissed, but never went any further. 

My friends organized another party to which I invited her again and this time she did come. We were kissing all night long, until the end of the night when we were drunk leaving the last bar, she trip and hit her head against a curb or step, I'm still not sure, she was bleeding so we called an ambulance, they took her to ER, I was feeling so guilty. As soon as the ambulance was gone I sent her a text begging her to write as soon as she was okay, next morning I woke up to a message from her asking to know what happened as she couldn't remember. I explained as much as I could and asked for forgiveness for not being able to take care of her. She was thankful that I called the ambulance and told me not to worry, as we both were too drunk. 

Two days after that she invited me to have lunch in her apartment, after which we cuddled for a little bit until I had to leave. That Saturday she came to visit me and we had sex. 

The week after she left on a long distance trip she had already planned for a while and that's when all the problems started, my anxiety started to play tricks on me and I couldn't control myself I started going on dating apps as a way of trying to regain some control, but of course it didn't do anything to actually calm me down. 

I hadn't talked to her about any of that, until we met when she returned from her trip, and I let her know that we should have better communication, to which she agreed and it was seemingly all good. The next day she left home for Christmas, and on Christmas day she texted me saying that her friend saw me on one of the dating apps and that although I hadn't done anything wrong she wasn't comfortable with me dating other people along with her, as her ex was unfaithful and that is still fresh in her mind, I was beyond embarrassed. The only thing I could do was explain myself and hope for the better, thankfully she was understanding and it was okay at the end. 

She came back on Friday and we met up on Saturday for boardgames with some friends, but before that we spent about an hour alone, we both wanted to have sex, but the time pressure made her call it off last minute, I was frustrated but I understood her reasons. After she left I sent her a message telling her that I would have loved to spend more time alone with her and that I hoped to see her after NYE, as she will be spending it with her friend somewhere else. She replied saying that Sunday night she would be home, and maybe we could spend it together after her work.
When her shift was over I texted her asking how she was, to which she replied that she was very tired and we shouldn't meet. I told her it was okay, but the message came of aggressive, to which I tried to explain myself that I was feeling anxious about when we would meet again. She replied that she didn't understand why I was feeling like that if there wasn't any reason, and that if it was always going to be like that, maybe we should reconsider the whole relationship, as she is still in need of healing herself and thus can't be always there to reassure me. The conversation escalated from that, but in the end she said we should remain friends and maybe in the future we could try dating again. I said I agree, but sincerely feel like it's going to be difficult to remain friends after all this, I haven't told her this, but maybe I should? 

She made the very valid point that at this point it feels like trauma bonding and it's not healthy, but I'm still willing to make an effort, what should I do? ",1,1735563254.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1hpmm21,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1hpmm21/i_dont_like_usbc/,I don't like usb-c,"One chilly morning in London, I stumbled into the kitchen, half-asleep and desperately craving coffee. My trusty coffee machine, a vintage model jury-rigged with a USB-C port (because I thought, *Why not?*), stood gleaming on the countertop. It was time to summon the caffeine gods.

I grabbed the USB-C cable dangling from my phone charger, plugged one end into the coffee machine, and the other into my laptop. Nothing happened.

I frowned. Maybe the machine needed a moment to wake up too? I jiggled the cable like a TV antenna from the '90s. Still nothing.

“Come on, you were working fine yesterday!” I muttered, staring at the cable like it owed me money.

The USB-C cable stared back in silent defiance.

I unplugged and re-plugged it, then rebooted the coffee machine. No luck. I switched USB-C cables. Nada. Even tried the “universal fix” of blowing into the port like it was an old cartridge. Nope.

Frustrated, I opened my laptop’s troubleshooting tool and, to my shock, the USB-C cable actually responded. But instead of brewing my coffee, a pop-up appeared:  
**""Device Not Supported. Please use a certified coffee-brewing cable.""**

“A certified coffee-brewing cable?” I groaned. “You're literally just a piece of wire!”

The USB-C cable didn’t care. It had standards, apparently.

Desperate, I searched online for “certified USB-C coffee cables.” To my horror, I discovered they were sold out everywhere. My only option was to order one from a shady website that promised “EXPRESS DELIVERY IN 2-3 DAYS!” Two days without coffee? Impossible.

Defeated, I resorted to boiling water the old-fashioned way. As the kettle whistled, I glared at the USB-C cable lying smugly on the counter. It wasn’t just a cable—it was a tyrant.

From that day forward, I kept a stash of instant coffee for emergencies. And every time I saw that USB-C cable, I swore it was laughing at me.

Please, send me a good usb-c cable for coffee machines, i need them, I NEED HELP.",0,1735563212.0,UsbCHardware,0,0.2,False

I was really scared of my skin breaking out because I’ve dealt with acne in the past. I read the book beyond the pill (it’s not everyone so pls don’t come at me about it lol) but her tips on foods and supplements and to take helped A LOT. This post will be long!!
I’ve been pooping regularly!! It was something I struggled with on the pill. I don’t bleed after sex anymore, unless it’s the week of my period or sometimes week before. My period has been coming every month but recently my cycle has been changing IE: coming a couple days earlier than the last sometimes. My periods have been easy to manage usually heavy the 3rd day and pretty light the other days, my period before the pill was heavy. My sleep is still a problem for me and I did notice some weight gain but not sure if it’s from being off the pill or just my body changing. 

My skin was doing great for a while and then I fell off of taking care of my food intake and supplements and it affected me negatively. (Currently breaking out around my mouth area) what has helped is 
- You are what you eat so eating foods that support my hormones and skin. 
- Magnesium supplements (I like the Magnesium from moon juice) 
- Pre/ Probiotics (I use the Seed probiotics.)
- Seed cycling!!!!
- Benzol peroxide from Paula’s choice on breakouts has helped A LOT, I have sensitive skin so warning to my sensitive skin girlies don’t over do it or it will burn your skin. I only put it on my break outs.
- Retinol: I started using retinol because I figured I might break out so the retinol purge won’t be as daunting.
- Cutting our energy drinks and coffee. 
- Trying to avoid too much sugar. 
- Adding a multi vitamin.

Lastly, giving myself patience and love. This is such a process and it’s hard sometimes to deal with the aftermath of what this pill has done to our bodies. With patience and compassion towards yourself it’ll make the journey a little easier. These are just some things that have helped me personally but everyone’s body is different. My biggest concern was my skin so I tried my best to find ways to take care of it. I’m so proud of everyone on this journey, I hope it becomes Essie for everyone. ❤️❤️",2,1735562886.0,gettingoffHBC,2,1.0,False

He will wake up around 4-6pm and won’t go to sleep til after 10/11. Currently he is still awake after 6 hours with 5 being trying to get him to sleep.  He gets drowsy and may even fall asleep for 5 mins max but then he wakes up - not even by startling- and it’s back to square 1. 

We try:
Swaddling - hard no from 4 weeks he now just screams til he is free
Singing - 50/50 on calming him down but no sleep
Tapping his bum or back - works during the day straight away at night it takes hours 
Feeding - feeding on demand as he cries and being prepared for the inevitable spit up which will make him pass out but can’t keep doing that. 
Rocking - in the rocking chair, while walking, inside and outside, on his front/back/side 
Changing nappies as needed
Bassinet- putting him down drowsy lays there for 5 mins then cries again until we pick him up. Putting him in asleep 50/50 might wake up and scream murder 
Putting him on the floor or sofa (supervised)


I’ve tried cutting caffeine out and there was no change to his attitude either and this all started just shy of 6 weeks old. And it’s 1 coffee and 1 tea a day typically. 

He sleeps ok during the day and will nap after feeds no problem so not sure if I need to keep him awake longer in the day? Or if that will make him more overtired? 
I understand there’s a growth spurt and learning skills that will impact sleep but how do we get an overtired cranky baby to sleep??

Hey everyone.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married and living a life most would be envious of.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I lol forward to talking to.

Is that you?",2,1735562370.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

H color diamonds offer exceptional value for savvy diamond shoppers. Here's why they're a top choice:

* H color is the sweetspot of the color scale, offering a near-colorless appearance that looks white to the naked eye while providing excellent value for money.
* Price difference: A 1.00 carat H VS1 diamond costs $3,610 while a similar F color diamond costs $5,430, a 3.6% price difference
* Versatile for various metal settings
* Lab-grown diamonds offer significant cost savings compared to natural diamonds. A 2.00 carat H color with VS1 clarity natural diamond is sold for $16,050, while a better looking 2.00 carat lab-grown diamond with D color and VVS2 clarity is sold for $3,070, a 422% price difference!
* The average price of a 1.00 carat H color diamond is $4,125

* Alternatively, you can save more if you choose a lower near colorless grade. For example, the average price of a 1.00 carat J color diamond is $3,352, approximately 23% price difference.

* H color is a great option for larger stones without significant price increase
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Budget-conscious buyers wanting near-colorless diamonds
* Shoppers looking for larger stones without breaking the bank
* Those prioritizing cut quality and overall appearance over color grade

# Who is this not for?

* Buyers insisting on strictly colorless diamonds
* Those choosing diamond shapes that show color more readily (e.g., emerald cuts)

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut quality: An excellent cut can make an H color diamond appear whiter and more brilliant.
2. Consider the setting: White gold or platinum can enhance the diamond's white appearance.
3. Compare with G color: Often, the visual difference is minimal, but the price savings are significant.

1. Pay attention to size: H color works well for most sizes, but for very large diamonds (3+ carats), you might consider G or higher.
2. Evaluate in different lights: Check the diamond under various lighting conditions to ensure you're satisfied with its appearance.

# FAQ

Q: Will an H color diamond look yellow?

A: No, H color diamonds appear white to the naked eye, especially when face-up.

Q: How does H compare to G color?

A: The difference is subtle. Most people can't distinguish between G and H without side-by-side comparison.

Q: Is H color good for engagement rings?

A: Yes, H color is an excellent choice for engagement rings, offering a great balance of quality and value.

Q: How much can I save with an H color diamond?

A: You can save 15-30% compared to colorless (D-F) diamonds of similar qualities.

Q: Are there any downsides to H color diamonds?

A: In larger sizes or certain cuts (like emerald), a very slight tint might be noticeable from the side. However, this is rarely an issue for most buyers.

Remember, while color is important, it's just one factor. Balance color with cut, clarity, and carat weight to find your perfect diamond.

1hpmdi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1hpmdi1/my_grandpa_knew_he_was_going_to_die_and_we/,"My grandpa knew he was going to die, and we witnessed his death.","I don't even know where to start. I'm currently going down a huge rabbit hole on death related things because I can't accept what happened, yet I can? My grandpa died, I know that. But what happens to him now, what happened to his subconscious? He can't just cease to exist?

The reason I'm like this is because my family knows he knew his time was up, which is hard to accept because he was such a healthy individual. He was a month off turning 78, and had just had stomach surgery to remove the cancer they found and was going to start chemo soon. The minute he was home from the hospital, he was back to his normal self, doing his usual jobs around the house.

  
The night before he passed, my grandma had a dream he was going to die. Christmas comes around and my grandparents come over, as my mum's birthday is on Christmas. He accidentally left his hat at our house, and before leaving our house, jokingly said he was going to take a pair of my shoes since he liked them. 

The next day I'm at work. The centre I work at, my grandparents visit everyday for their usual coffee and so my grandpa can see his friends while my grandma visits me at work. 15 minutes after arriving and my grandma going to get their coffees, he collapsed and died suddenly. We found out it was from a heart attack, but he never has had any heart related issues. We think he wanted to die away from home, as to not hurt my grandma anymore than he needed to, because it was his idea to go out that day. Mind you it was a really hot day, so staying home wouldve been the beter thing to do, but he said lets go out for a coffee. If he had died at home, my grandma wouldnt be able to cope.

The night before he passed, he randomly decided to go and pick out a suit to make sure it still fit him because he had lost weight. Why?? We didnt have any weddings or formal events coming up. There was so reason to? Adding all these things up proves to us he knew and everything he chose to do on the day he passed was intentional.

I will never forget rushing out of work with my dad telling me he collapsed and died. I thought it was a joke, until i walked out only a few metres from the shop I work at to see him, behind screens laying there dead. The ambulance couldnt do anything to revive him. 

I wish I spent more time with him. While he was in the hospital being treated after being diagnosed with stomach cancer and having his surgery, I couldn't see him there often because I work full time. I never thought he would die so young and it just feels surreal. What messes with me the most is the fact he knew. ",3,1735562316.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1hpmc0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapabilityAdvocate/comments/1hpmc0x/lets_clear_the_air_autism_spectrum_disorder_asd/,Let's clear the air: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) does not have a monopoly on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA),"That's like saying only superheroes wear capes! Sure, ABA and ASD often go together like peanut butter and jelly ... both sweet and sticking to everything they touch ... but let’s not forget, ABA’s toolkit works on more than just the neurodiverse crowd. 

ABA is used in schools to teach Johnny not to eat glue, in businesses to train employees without resorting to coffee bribes, and even in animal training (ever wondered how they get those dolphins to jump so high at SeaWorld?).

So, while ASD might be a VIP at the ABA party, it’s definitely not the only guest enjoying the behavioral bash! So there is an association.

The strong association between Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) stems from several key factors:

1. **Effectiveness in Treating ASD**: ABA has been proven highly effective in helping individuals with autism develop essential skills and reduce undesired behaviors. Because of its success, it has become a preferred treatment method for ASD, often recommended by psychologists, physicians, and education professionals.
2. **Extensive Research and Documentation**: There is a substantial body of research that supports the effectiveness of ABA in improving communication, social skills, and learning in individuals with autism. This extensive documentation has reinforced its reputation as a go-to approach for ASD.
3. **Insurance and Funding**: Many insurance providers cover ABA therapy specifically for autism treatment, which has helped facilitate its widespread adoption for this purpose. This financial support has not only made ABA more accessible for individuals with ASD but has also highlighted its use in this area.
4. **Public Awareness**: Awareness campaigns and advocacy groups often focus on ABA as a treatment for autism, further reinforcing its connection to ASD in public perception.
5. **Specialized Training**: Many professionals trained in ABA often specialize in autism, due to the demand and established frameworks for therapy in this area. This specialization has contributed to the perception that ABA is primarily for autism.

However, ABA's principles and techniques are applicable to a broad range of behaviors and settings beyond autism. It is used in various fields such as education, psychology, healthcare, animal training, and business to modify behaviors and improve outcomes. The foundational principles of behavior analysis—understanding what maintains an individual’s behavior and how it is influenced by the environment—can be applied to anyone, not just those with ASD.

# DEC. 19th 2024~ Kendall Sees Progress on CCA Drones as His Legacy; F-35 ‘Not Going Away

[Kendall Sees Progress on CCA Drones as His Legacy](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/kendall-progress-cca-drones-legacy-f-35-ngad/)

[General Atomics' full-scale model of its Collaborative Combat Aircraft Increment 1 was displayed at AFA's Air, Space and Cyber conference in mid-September.](https://preview.redd.it/ihz11gud7z9e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=4025d1d640be8a7aa26fb4fd6664d37bf481cf33)

Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, poised to leave office next month, thinks his push to advance autonomous drones that accompany manned aircraft—the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program—will be the most revolutionary of the many programs he launched and organizational changes he’s made in the job.

**At the same time, Kendall said Dec. 19, the F-35 fighter will be a crucial platform for many years to come and likely won’t be supplanted by CCA drones, which he said have a long way to go before they can match the human-piloted F-35’s performance.**

Looking ahead, Kendall also said at AFA’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies that an analysis on the future of the Next-Generation Air Dominance fighter is largely finished, but he wants the incoming administration led by President-elect Donald Trump to make the final choice and “own” decisions made about air superiority.

# F-35

Despite the revolutionary nature of the CCA, the F-35 “isn’t going away,” Kendall observed.

“It’s a state-of-the-art system that’s continuously being upgraded,” he said. “There’s a reason so many countries are buying the F-35. It is dominant over fourth generation fighters, period, in a very, very serious way. It’s not even close. And there is no alternative to that in the near term.”

In the meantime, “we should continue to buy and operate” the F-35,” Kendall insisted.

[A U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II participating in NATO exercise Ramstein Flag 24 flies over the west coast of Greece, Oct. 4, 2024. U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Emili Koonce](https://preview.redd.it/5i57m3ga8z9e1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=baa33899184664e61e6a7224bdb933d98e9c604f)

He did say, however, that the government needs better performance from Lockheed Martin, the F-35 prime contractor, because, “quite honestly, they’ve not been delivering what they’ve been promising, and they’re not doing that as fast as they could, by a wide margin.”

Kendall also noted that an agreement on [Lots 18 and 19 of the F-35](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/lockheed-f-35-program-office-lots-18-19/) has just been reached, and they will be more expensive for several reasons, including more complexity, capability, and inflation.

But the F-35 is “a world-class fighter,” Kendall said. The Air Force has stuck with its 20-year-old objective of acquiring 1,763 F-35s, and while “it’s impossible to predict” whether that figure will stand, “we’re going to be buying more for some period,” he added, noting that future decisions about [NGAD](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/weapons-platforms/ngad/) and CCAs could change things down the road.

Kendall said that if the Air Force proceeds with the Next-Generation Air Dominance program, “it’s going to be several years before we can field them in quantity” and its cost will be “very expensive compared to the F-35.”

# NGAD

The future of NGAD is very much up in the air after Kendall [decided to punt decisions](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/air-force-defers-ngad-decision-trump-administration/) about it to his successor under Trump. Two weeks later, he stood by that call.

“I don’t want to make a decision that’s going to be disrupted and reversed, potentially, by the new team,” he said. “Whatever we decide to do about that mix of programs, the new team is going to want to be able to support it and take it forward for the next four years.” He felt it was “really smart, in this case, to delay a decision. The analysis is mostly done. The new team may want some additional analysis, but I want them to own this decision, and I don’t want us to start industry down a specific course and then have to abruptly reverse that few months from now.”

He put the NGAD [under review this summer,](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/air-force-pause-ngad-kendall/) delaying a development contract and putting the unnamed finalists under an extended Technical Maturation and Risk Reduction, or TMRR contract.  

There was an “affordability concern” with NGAD, which Kendall has at times characterized as potentially costing hundreds of millions of dollars per aircraft.

“It’s very expensive airplane that we could only afford in small quantities, and it has a relatively narrow mission profile, designed around certain operations and threats,” Kendall said.

Those cost concerns led to a broader reckoning, though, about the fundamental requirements for NGAD and its usefulness with changing technology. That analysis was led by a blue-ribbon panel of general and experts and is “generally done,” Kendall said. It looked at how the NGAD fighter would “operate in a mix that included uncrewed platforms” and in an Agile Combat Employment environment, in which the Air Force expects to operate from a multitude of austere locations to complicate an opponent’s targeting of air bases.

**“I think the right thing to do to kick the final decision on this into the next administration,” he said, but “they’re going to need to move fast. The ‘25 budget is already on the Hill. It probably won’t be passed for a few more months. And the ‘26 budget is going to need to be submitted. So those are going to be the drivers on getting final decisions on what mix of capabilities is pursued.”**

The US Space Force recently tested a new ground-based weapon that can reportedly defend against “space-enabled” attacks.

Called the Remote Modular Terminal (RMT), the device can jam enemy satellites by flooding the airwaves with competing signals.

Once the airwaves are clogged, communication signals being sent to and from the satellite are disrupted.

According to the service’s Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM), the test saw the system being fielded for the first time at two separate locations and controlled from a third, demonstrating operational flexibility.

It was evaluated based on system latency, target engagement accuracy, and network security. However, the results of the test were not made available to the public.

“This event demonstrates the service’s new vision for integrated developmental and operational tests to provide more relevant capabilities to guardians faster,” US Space Force Lt. Col. **Gerrit Dalman** [said](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/468857/starcom-tests-rmt-system-space-rapid-capabilities-office).

# Providing Counter Space EW Capability

Although details about the RMT are scarce, official photos available online show the device resembling a satellite dish with a diameter of around 10 feet (3 meters).

Its primary task is to render enemy satellites useless for communications, surveillance, or weapons guidance.

According to STARCOM, the system is designed to be fielded in large numbers and operated remotely to keep soldiers out of harm’s way.

It is also reportedly made with increased capacity, adaptability, and resiliency to defend against sophisticated space-enabled attacks.

Once all trials are complete, Dalman said the cost-effective weapon will provide improved counter space electronic warfare capability to the US military.

# Race With China

Testing of the RMT satellite-jamming weapon comes as the US military continues to invest in bolstering its space capabilities amid a race with China and increasing threats from Russia.

Dubbed Washington’s [biggest threat in space](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/02/20/us-china-threat-space/), Beijing has ramped up development of space-based platforms, such as spy satellites and spacecraft.

It has also formed a [fifth military force](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/11/23/china-near-space-command/) – the “Near-Space Command” – said to safeguard a contested zone deemed crucial for determining the outcome of future battles.

# A Peek at Scandium’s impact on the Additive Manufacturing of Aluminum Alloys

# The future of Additive Manufacturing lies in part production at scale. Innovation must, therefore, focus on how to reduce part cost and improve performance. Unlike other manufacturing processes, weight is time in AM – and time is money; raw material costs take a back seat when it comes to overall part cost. Here, Jonathan Meyer (APWORKS) and John Barnes (Metal Powder Works/The Barnes Global Advisors) explore the case for scandium-based aluminium alloys for AM from both technical and economic perspectives.

The buzzing of the call woke up Nick. He came to consciousness slowly, confused, tangled up in Eastern and Selkirk. It took a minute to realize what it was. His implants were buzzing with a ping from an outside source. It… felt different from when he used his phone, it was more personal than that.  

Nick sat up, and remembering the things that Queenie taught him, checked the source and opened the connection. It was filled with static, but he expected that; it was an encrypted link. It must be Sunny calling. He applied her keys and the message resolved.

""Hey meatsack. Got some news for you. I've got some information on your missing AI.""

""Sunny?""

""Who else, fuckface? Ancestors, I can't stand BIs. How do you even sleep? The whole process squicks me out and makes me uncomfortable. You just go unconscious for hours at a time and are *fine* with it."" Nick could see Sunny's avatar on the call shudder. ""Anyway, I don't have much. That person *did not* want to be found, if they even exist at all."" Sunny stops and her avatar looks thoughtful. ""Nick are you sure this person exists?""

Nick wasn't actually sure. He said as much to Sunny. ""We were ordered to find her from Jameson. He said she was his daughter, so we assumed she was real. Why would he lie?""

Sunny peered at Nick and raised an eyebrow. ""Ancestors be damned you're thick, Nick. He's got all kinds of reasons to lie."" Sunny looked down at something. It was only an avatar for their voice only call, but it did a decent job emulating her expressions. ""Nick. I'll give you the info I found, and I did run right up against the contracted fifty hours, but."" Sunny sighed. ""I can't believe I'm being nice to a BI, what's come over me."" She started again. ""Nick, you might want to leave this one. Lift off Hyacinth, go start somewhere else. Jameson is a big hat here on Hyacinth, but *only* on Hyacinth. Even if you went in-system to Luna or hell, even Venus you'd probably be free of him.""

""Wait, what? Why?""

Sunny turned her head and gave Nick a *look*. ""Because this whole thing stinks and I think that if you look deep within yourself, you'll smell it too."" Sunny starts ticking points off on her fingers.  ""All you were given was a name and a statement that she's Jameson's daughter. Then you were stuffed full of cybernetics. *Then* you were turned loose on Hyacinth and were picked up by Houndstooth almost *immediately* and told the same basic thing. 'Go get Yon.' Still no description."" Sunny shook her head. ""Nicholas North you are being *played*."" 

""To what end?""

""Fuck if I know, Nick. You didn't pay me to find that out."" She raises a finger. ""And before you ask, you don't have enough. I'm out. She gestured at him and a file appeared in his vision. ""Here's what I found. Use it or not, I don't care. I'm just telling you to leave this one be because I'm so fucking caring about the lives of BIs."" In a flash, she switched to the old Sunny. It was the same old slightly ditzy grin, the same bubbly personality; ""Don't call me again Nick! I'm deleting these encryption keys. If I see you in The Basement, I never met you, and I expect you to act the same way."" Her fake Smile was sickly and disconcerting as she waved. ""Bye Nick! Fuck off!"" Sunny closed the connection.

Nick laid in bed, trapped by Eastern and Selkrik for a while longer. He used the opportunity to think about their predicament. Nick opened the file and uses Sunny's keys to decrypt it. As the decryption finished, the keys evaporated, their job completed.

It's... not much to go on.

The report was peppered with little comments by Sunny, pointing out details and parts that - to her - don't add up. There *might be* an AI who goes by Yon when they're in a body and they *probably* claimed Hyacinth as a residence within the last *fifty* years. Nick stopped a moment when he read this. He knew that AIs could be old, and so long as they keep up on maintenance don't really die unless they're killed, but the fact that Yon may have lived on Hyacinth within the last fifty years is not a lot go go on. Reading further he sees that Sunny agrees with him that the timeline is way too wide to be effective. Sunny also pointed out that the moment she tried to dig deeper than superficial details she would get attacked by anti-hacking algorithms. Her annotation mentioned that they were ""Real dark stuff too, not the normal watchdogs.""

At the bottom of the report was an image of a sheet of paper. Sunny actually went through the effort of mimicking a handwritten note.

""Nick. My goodness you're fucked. If I were to guess, I'd say Yon does exist, but she’s doing something that’s so deep that anyone who looks gets forgotten about. You are being - to us an ancient idiom - played. I don't know why, and I don't *care* why. If you don't value your continued existence, bring it up with your employer. If you do value your continued existence, sell all your shit and book passage away. Doesn't matter where, just liftoff.”

The note was then signed ""Sunny"" with crudely drawn hearts and daggers stabbing a stick figure of a person - probably a BI.

Nick leaned back in bed and sighed. He slowly and carefully extricated himself from the tangle of people in the bed and padded towards the kitchen. He got some coffee and tea going and once it was ready, padded to the living room. Sitting on the couch, he carefully took a sip of the hot coffee and put his head back, leaning against the top of the couch and stared at the ceiling a long time.

After a while, Eastern and Selkirk came out, looking concerned. Selkirk came over and sat next to Nick while Eastern went and got coffee and tea for them. ""Nick, what's wrong?""

""I got a message from Sunny.""

""Not good news, I take it."" Sel said.

As they were talking, Eastern came in and handed a mug of tea to Selkirk.

Nick looked at both of them. Together, he thought. Together they'd get through this. ""Sunny says that basically there might have been an AI that went by Yon who might have claimed residence on Hyacinth, but she wasn't able to pin down her living here anytime in the last *fifty years*. Basically, if she is real, then she’s doing something do deep and clandestine that nobody can find her, and she wants it that way,” Nick sighed. ""Sunny also said to never call her again.""

Eastern and Selkirk were stunned into silence. All three of them stared up at the ceiling. ""So, what does this mean?"" Eastern was so quiet she was almost whispering.

""Means we've just gotten confirmation we're being fucked with.” Selkirk glowered into her mug of tea, her ears flat. And her tail tail fluffed out angrily.""

""Yes, but by who? Jameson? Doesn't make sense. He seemed adamant that he had a daughter. He even gave Nick and me fucking cybernetics.”

“Yeah, about that” Sel said, looking at Eastern. “Nick was the one that talked to Queenie, Nick was the one who Sunny was talking with, are you *sure* you have cybernetics?”

 

Eastern continued on, “Houndstooth? Siobhan wouldn't go through all that effort for nothing."" Eastern rubbed her temples. ""Argh, it doesn't make sense. Nothing makes sense."" Finally, she looked up. “What did you say, Sel?”

“Eastern.” Selkirk leaned in closely, staring at her. Eastern blinked and leaned back just a little bit. “Did you get cybernetics?”

“Yes, er, I mean, I think so? Why wouldn’t I? Jameson knocked me out same as Nick and said that I got them too.”

“But did you? Nobody has said anything about them since; nobody has even talked to you about them. Doesn’t that strike you as odd?”

Eastern reached up to the back of her neck, under her hair and touched gently. Her brow furrowed and she felt around. Lifting up her hair she said, “Sel, look for me. Are there ports?”

Selkirk leaned close to Eastern, and couldn’t help but notice how nice she smelled, it was like clean laundry, and the bedding, and just that underlying human pheromone that most of them don’t realize they give off. But- “No, Eastern. There’s nothing there.”

“But why?” Nick said, looking over at Eastern’s neck. “We shared a dream when we were under, when I showed you Parvati, and you showed me Luna.”

“Wait. Nick, *what happened* on Luna?” Eastern said, quietly.

“It was the time you got to meet Empress Melody, and then…” Nick looked up at the both of them sharply. “Then Melody told me that I didn’t belong there and I woke up.”

Selkirk sat heavily on the couch in between Eastern and Nick. “So. Do either of you know anything about Nanites?”

“About what?” Eastern said.

“Nanites. Nanotech. Microscopic machines which - in the case of Empress Melody - were also the source of an alien intelligence who helped her out.”

“Alien… Ancestors Sel, what the hell is this?” Nick said, staring at her.

“It’s something that the AIs tried very hard to keep quiet. It’s also why they were able to defeat Melody’s invasion so handily. Melody and her ‘Builders’ were stuffed with alien nanotechnology.”

Eastern shook her head. “It’s so odd to hear you say Alien Sel. Everyone says Sapient.”

“In this case, they are strange enough that Alien works.” Selkirk’s ears flicked. “Anyway, the Nanites picked Melody to be Empress, and if the AIs haven’t been absolutely, positively sure they got them all, then they could quietly rebuild themselves and…”

“You’re saying that instead of getting cybernetics like Nick, I’ve got *the same thing that Empress Melody had?”* Eastern said, her voice rising. “I don’t buy it. Why can’t I order people around? Wasn’t she able to do that?”

“Have you tried?” Nick said, quietly. 

Eastern slowly turned towards Nick, and stared at him, hard. “Nick, would you be a dear and g̸e̸t̶ me another coffee?”

Automatically, Nick stood up, rising so fast that the coffee table in front of them slid out. He was halfway to the kitchen before he stopped, and looked down at his hands. “Uh, do you still want that coffee?” He said.

“Yes, but you were able to stop, maybe it wasn’t a real order.” Eastern said as Nick went into the kitchen to get more coffee.

“Or maybe *your* Nanites aren’t online all the way, or aren’t communicating with you properly. Eastern you saw how he stood up, it’s like he was being remote controlled.”

“We should go see Jameson.” Eastern said as she touched her mouth gently. “If he did it, he’ll know what *the fuck* is going on.”

“Is that such a good idea, Eastern?” Selkirk said “I thought the AIs hated Melody and her Empire.”

""Oh Fuck no. This is incredibly stupid."" Eastern’s laugh was high, brittle. She was trying very hard not to panic. ""But I don't have anything else.""

The three of them left Eastern's apartment and walked out to the square. Nick looked at Eastern. ""I don't have a Hopper account, and I don't know Jameson's address. Can you call us one?""

Eastern fumbles for her pad, bobbled it, caught it before it hit the ground, and opened it. ""Sure Nick. We're getting pretty low on funds though, so unless we get a payout from Jameson we're taking the metro down to the bottom and then back up here when we're done. We have enough money for a Hopper there, not one back.”

""I thought we had an expense account."" Selkirk put her hands on her hips as they waited. 

""We did. We burned through it."" Eastern said, absently.

""Hmmph. Some expense account.""

The Hopper descended while they groused about money. Everyone climbed aboard and dashed across arms to the industrial arm where Jameson lived.

As they approached his building, there were a few of Jameson's goons sitting outside in folding chairs playing cards and watching videos on their pad. They looked up as the three of them walked up. The one by the door nodded and opened the door. ""Jameson is in the back Eastern, check in with Kelly at the front desk first though, okay?""

Eastern, Nick and Selkirk were fully taken aback. This was not how they expected to be treated. ""R-right you are. Thanks"" Eastern answered and the three of them headed in.

In the comfortable waiting room, Kelly was where they saw her before, once again watching videos on her pad. She looked up as they entered. ""Hey Eastern, Nick, Selkirk. I'll let Jameson know you're here.""

The three of them sat on the chairs in stunned silence.

After three or four minutes the door opened and Jameson himself wheeled out to the waiting room. ""Eastern! and Nick and Selkirk! How are you? Healing up all right? It's good to see you? You need a drink? Come on, come with me to my office and we can chat.""

Eastern, Nick and Selkirk stiffly stood up and followed him into his office. This time there were no guards behind them to slam the door, no chairs with straps, no beds. Just Jameson's desk and a few chairs. They sat down stiffly and watched Jameson wheel himself behind his desk and connect.

""Ah. That's better. Now, what can Jameson do for you three?""

Eastern lifted up her hair and showed Jameson the back of her neck. “I don’t *have* cybernetics, Jameson. Nick does though. You knocked us *both* out. What’s the deal?”

Jameson took out an unlabeled bottle filled with an amber liquid and four cut crystal glasses. He methodically poured a measure of the liquid into each of them and slid three across to Eastern, Nick, and Sel, while taking one for himself. He sighed, and sniffed deeply. “Some AIs are built such that they can eat and drink - the oldest ones mostly - and some can even break down the carbohydrates and sugars into fuel.” He put the glass down, without taking a sip. “I can’t though.” He gestured to his torso. “All that was taken out when I… became who I am. Feel free to drink on my behalf though.” He gestured towards the drinks. 

Nick took one and figuring that if they were this deep, a little more wouldn’t hurt and took a sip. It was very nice bourbon. He nodded towards Eastern and Sel and Eastern took her glass and took a very large gulp. Selkirk didn’t, and stared at Jameson. “Why does she have **Nanites**, *AI*.” She spit out the term as she spoke, her voice withering, angry. As she said it, Nick thought back to what Sunny said. She was right, it could be a slur depending on how one said it. “They don’t know what you did, but I do. Call it K’laxi intuition. I know what she has. I know what she is.” Sel leaned forward and put her hands onto his desk, her claws sliding out of her fingertips. “Why.” ",7,1735561742.0,HFY,3,0.9,False
1hpm74d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1hpm74d/this_devotional_can_explore_various_bible_verses/,"This devotional can explore various Bible verses that highlight the importance of friendship, the qualities of a good friend, and how God calls us to cultivate deep, meaningful relationships with others. Each entry could include a verse, a reflection, and a prayer.","https://bgodinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1735561051.png

**Devotional on Friendship: Cultivating Meaningful Relationships**

### Day 1: The Foundation of Friendship

**Verse:**

Proverbs 17:17 (NIV) – “A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity.”

**Reflection:**

Friendship is one of God’s beautiful gifts to us. It’s a reflection of His love, support, and companionship. True friends stand by our side, not just in joyous moments, but especially during the trials we face. We can think of our friends as God’s tangible encouragement, reminding us that we are never alone.

What does it look like in your life to be a friend who loves at all times? Are there opportunities for you to reach out in kindness or support someone who might be going through a rough patch? Let’s remember that through our presence and actions, we can model the unconditional love God shows us.

**Prayer:**

Dear Lord, thank You for the gift of friendship. Help me to be a true friend who loves consistently, especially in difficult times. Allow me to see the needs of those around me and be a source of comfort and support. Amen.

- - - - - -

### Day 2: The Qualities of a Good Friend

**Verse:**

Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 (NIV) – “Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them.”

**Reflection:**

This passage reminds us that companionship enhances our lives significantly. Friends can lift us up when we stumble and celebrate with us in our successes. Consider the qualities that make a friend trustworthy, supportive, and encouraging. The best friendships are characterized by mutual care and accountability. As we cultivate these qualities in ourselves, we will foster deeper connections with those around us.

Take a moment to reach out to a friend today. Perhaps express something you appreciate about them or offer your help in their current situation. Often, the smallest acts of kindness can strengthen the bonds of friendship.

**Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, thank You for the friends You’ve placed in my life. Help me to embody the qualities of a good friend and foster relationships that honor You. Teach me to be there for others as I would want them to be there for me. Amen.

- - - - - -

### Day 3: The Call to Community

**Verse:**

Hebrews 10:24-25 (NIV) – “And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.”

**Reflection:**

God designed us for community, emphasizing the need for fellowship with one another. In a world that often promotes isolation, we are called to meet together, encourage each other, and lift one another’s spirits. When we build and nurture our friendships, we create a safe space for love, accountability, and growth.

Consider implementing regular gatherings—be it a coffee date, a group hike, or a simple phone call. This intentional time spent with friends can be the encouragement that not only uplifts them but brings you closer together in faith.

**Prayer:**

Dear God, thank You for the gift of community. Help me to seek opportunities to connect with others and cultivate friendships that reflect Your love. Let my words and actions inspire those around me to pursue love and good deeds. Amen.

- - - - - -

### Day 4: Friendship Through Challenges

**Verse:**

Proverbs 27:17 (NIV) – “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.”

**Reflection:**

True friendship often involves challenging one another to grow spiritually and personally. The process of sharpening can be tough, but it creates resilience and strength in our characters. Friends may hold us accountable and encourage us to step out of our comfort zones, leading us toward the person God created us to be.

Reflect on your friendships: do they help you grow? Are you willing to be honest with your friends, even when it’s difficult? A friend who sharpens you is one who truly believes in your potential.

**Prayer:**

Lord, thank You for friends who challenge me to be better. Give me the courage to be open and honest in my friendships. May I also be a source of encouragement and growth for those I love. Amen.

- - - - - -

### Day 5: The Eternal Nature of Friendship

**Verse:**

John 15:15 (NIV) – “I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.”

**Reflection:**

Jesus calls us His friends, which is a transformative truth. In this relationship, He shares His heart and purpose with us. Our friendship with Him illuminates the pathway to deeper friendships with others. Understanding His love helps us cultivate friendships that are rich and grounded in faith.

As you close your devotional for the week, meditate on how you can be a friend like Jesus—one who is loving, dependable, and sincere. Imagine the impact we can have if we all strive to reflect Christ’s love in our friendships.

**Prayer:**

Gracious Father, thank You for the ultimate example of friendship in Jesus. Help me to embody His love in my relationships. May I become a friend who encourages, supports, and exemplifies Your grace to all those I meet. Amen.

- - - - - -

May each of these reflections remind you of the beauty of friendship and encourage you to build and cherish the relationships God has placed in your life. Let His love shine through you as you walk alongside others on life’s journey.

I'm sober curious, have been experimenting with not drinking and have always tried to eat healthy. Over the holidays, I have been asked to go to a few night parties that involve drinking. I have found that no matter what I do, it is just hard for me. The first event, I didn't drink and literally went in the bathroom to cry, felt better and then when dessert was offered, I gorged on it. At the second event, I brought coffee as a backup, felt happy about that, but still gorged on desserts (might as well have something good while everyone is drinking) but then I couldn't sleep that night due to the caffeine (LOL). The third event, I just drank. I didn't get horrendously drunk but I had about 4, didn't sleep well because I never do when I drank. Now an old friend, whom I haven't spent time with in a year, wants to get together at night (she's a big drinker). I know she will get mad at me if I decline since I've declined many times in the past. I don't want to get into reasons why I can't with her. I don't want to be a bore, but I'm about ready to be a hermit. I feel like something the cat drug in. Thoughts? ",6,1735561645.0,SoberCurious,5,0.88,False

1hpm5lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1hpm5lk/elphaba_is_green_and_so_is_the_hulk/,elphaba is green and so is the hulk,"I'd like to be free in a way that only I can know. An endless field in which to roam that doesn't test my mind nor breaks my bones. I want to find the wealth that men promise can only be found in gold. This thing that I was promised. That I never needed to be told. 

The things left unsaid. 

I want my parents to be happy so I'm willing to provide. My mother gave to me, she gave me the trees and the tide. She'll die some day soon. Growing airless, a little hairless, her drunken steps too careless. 

I need money. I need it fast and I need it cheap. ""Let me tell you something about the real world,"" they said to me, ""close your eyes and you risk blinking away your life."" But they didn't tell me that the real world runs on freedom. Green and American. 

Elphaba was green and that didn't seem to do her any favours so maybe its the other thing. So was the Hulk though and he's cool as hell, but he sells too well for me to tell if his greenness and his wealth are separate. 

Maybe, just maybe, its not about being green. 

I don't know. The colour of my skin only makes me aware of a stark white room that is marred when I enter it. My brain runs like a ticking bomb, counting down a vague number as I guess how much of a dent buying coffee in the morning makes to my financial stability. If I'm one coffee short from making rent this month then I'll only have myself to blame. If I'm one pack of cigarettes short of making rent this month then at least the cigarettes will keep me warm while I smoke myself away on my sister's couch.

[Breakfast?](https://preview.redd.it/xexhta163y9e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c3c5bc6975c20ac0aa63fe550651a2e6cfe1af4)

Awaking from the stupor of sleep, I can hear and feel my brain's synapses attempting to fire like old, sticky pistons in an overused engine struggling to turn over, emitting a faint, desperate mouse squeak. The stingy synapses are hesitant to expend energy for the sake of my lucidity as if conserving fuel for a long, uncertain journey, or a scene from a movie. They're firing with the intensity of a lit match in a soundproof walk-in safe where the air is as stale and the darkness is as dark as an unbathed rectum, where the owner inadvertently locked himself inside in darkness and low oxygen and is seeking comfort in not dying in silence and solitude. Today will be like a scene out of a movie!

For breakfast, I avoid the toxic substances masquerading as breakfast that are daily fed to children. Processed, sugar-loaded, artificially dyed cereals and 0% fruit juices that seem to be designed by capitalistic sadists or nutritionally nihilistic scientists. What kind of parents knowingly serve their kids a noxious cocktail to start the day? I want my child to eat addictive, sweet junk and be hyper for a good start to a morning . I want my child to mainline sugar, food dyes and artificial flavors, because what's a childhood without a few ADHD symptoms?

Odd how they've fallen under the spell of convenience and advertising, like flies to a poop mound of false promises and manipulated desires. An equation where capitalism and profit equal deception and disregard for health. A twisted arithmetic where the pursuit of profit is directly proportional to the erosion of our well-being, which in turn fuels the lucrative cycle of chronic illness, conveniently serviced by Big Pharma's endless supply of symptom-management solutions – never cures for customers, always patients for profits.

Pity for the teachers who have to deal with the aftermath of this insidious breakfast culture? Choreographing the education dance for sugar-fueled hyper children in the mornings and glucose peaks and lows leading to fatigue in the afternoon. Educators expected to function as nurses. Tasked with mitigating the damage inflicted by a society that prioritizes shareholders over children's health. Do they manage discipline like a game of whack-a-mole, striking with swiftness and discretion? Or slip a calming tonic to calm the children? It's a heroic task, really, and a testament to the dedication and patience of our underpaid, under-appreciated educators.

I had a snot attack last night, but I knew better than to sip on the celebrated poison called NyQuil. A supposedly soothing elixir is actually a toxic potion of high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, and artificial sweeteners, mixed with a medley of synthetic dyes, including the infamous Yellow No. 6, which has been linked to hyperactivity and cancer. And a death beckoning dose of acetaminophen, which can wreak havoc on your liver and kidneys. The ingredient label reads like a how-to guide for slow-release rat poisoning, cloaked as relief. And yet, parents are encouraged to feed this noxious brew to their sniffling kids, guaranteeing a lifetime of dependence on pharmaceuticals and a weakened immune system to boot. Like a scene out of a movie!

[Local News](https://preview.redd.it/dip3g2xl3y9e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2deb40d723f355476099a15a1dde802e49177d2)

I reluctantly turn on the local news on my Un-Smart TV. The fake news on the screen casts an eerie glow on my walls and the news anchor twitches with sensationalism-induced body tremors. His limbs jerking in a spasmodic dance, his eyes rolling back, tongue withdrawing  to the back of his throat like a vending machine pulling in a dollar bill. The anchor's voice booms in, adopting that signature tone of feigned gravitas and manufactured urgency, like a used car salesman, the one that says, 'This is serious, folks, but not so serious that we can't cut to a commercial break about the new lavender Nyquil in 30 seconds.' His voice a cacophonous caricature of credibility. Morphing into actor, his voice a jarring mashup of feigned empathy and calculated hysteria. We have shocking reports coming in of yet another woman being punched in the face for walking with a plain, style-less swagger, a gait that's an affront to urban fashion, an insult to native New Yorkers who seem to demand a certain je ne sais quoi from their fellow pedestrians...or else.

Our reporter, Nancy Newsie, is live on the scene of this barbaric fashion scolding. Nancy, can you tell us more about what happened? Nancy replies, ""Yes, I'm here with the victim, who's still shaken by the ordeal. It was like a scene out of a movie! Young lady, can you describe what happened?"" The victim trembles, like a furless polar bear, her words barely above a whisper, like a conversation between ants. Victim responds, her face reddened with the imprint of a fist on her cheek, a livid, swollen bruise that's already starting to darken, like a browning banana, ""It was like a scene out of a movie! He ran up to me and punched me, and it hurt so bad... like...like a scene out of a movie!"" The camera lingers on her face, the bruise a stark reminder of the violence she endured, which will undoubtedly provide a boost for TV ratings. As the camera zooms in on the bruise, the victim's eyes well up with tears, her pupils constricting in a mixture of pain, surprise, and a flicker of guilty joy for being on TV. Nancy Newsie asks, ""And did you see your attacker? Can you describe them to us?""

""He punched me and hopped away on one leg,"" yelling, ""'Yo, walk right, hoe! Ain't no strollin' in the hood!' It was totally like a scene out of a movie!""

After my painstaking consumption of local news, I drink my cheap instant coffee with a shot of apple cider vinegar, one bitter flavor masking the other, I switch to Al-Jazeera and BBC news for factual news, where journalistic integrity is not ritually sacrificed at the altar of ratings and advertising revenue. I savor my rancid coffee, far from the high-quality Indonesian coffee made from a coffee bean defecated by the Asian Palm civet. I prefer my coffee beans not to pass thru the rectum of living creatures. My synapses awaken from their sleep, firing with a sense of relief, from exposure to news organizations whose professionalism  counteract the superfluous sensationalism of local news. Grounded in reality, these news outlets prioritize veracity over shock value. The defibrillator-like jolt from actual news provide equilibrium and I can get back to critical thinking and prepare to use my day off for grocery shopping, which is essentially an unpaid workday in a different location. Few tasks require more critical thinking than grocery shopping. Like a scene out of a movie.

[\\""Dupermarket\\""](https://preview.redd.it/5d7cann76y9e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b9ccfd2bd38077e46833168f3702f7ad21b5d37)

I trudge out to restock my fridge and pantry, begrudgingly surrendering to the death grip of my local supermarket. As I approach the supermarket, I'm met with a monotonous façade that seems to absorb the color from the surrounding landscape of neighboring businesses. Their bright color schemes become faint in a rat-like gray.  The gray brick exterior appears dull and haunted. The gray signs bearing the store's name seem to whisper half-truths and dares. The gray doors slide open with a creepy whoosh, revealing a world of numbing conformity driven by capitalism. The overall effect is hypnotic, as if the ""dupermarket's"" very architecture is designed to lull me into a state of trance shopping, where critical thinking is abandoned in favor of mindless consumption. Like a scene out of a movie. It's essentially a drab concrete box with large windows covered with generic posters stating the obvious or outright lies: Fresh bread. Fresh dairy. Fresh produce. Low Prices. But posters should read: Stale bread but not yet moldy. Nearly expired milk (and we keep the newer milk in the back of the fridge in a corner difficult to access to discourage you from reaching it). Produce is semi-fresh but store-prepared produce is definitely old. Lowest Prices but only Highest Prices guarantee freshness.

I hate this anti-gut-health food prison, but its proximity and convenience have me firmly in its grasp. The narrow aisles seem designed to trap me, with crowded merchandise stacked on either side, making me feel like a hyperventilating roach caught on a roach motel. The air is thick with the smell of stale bread and old fish. My eyes recede deep into my skull attempting to evade the overpowering odors. The light is so bright, it's difficult to see, as if to discourage label reading. The shoppers, faces gaunt and hopeless, shuffle along single file through each aisle as if they're on a conveyor belt leading them to a meat grinder. Their empty stares suggest a complete surrender to the supermarket's machinations. As they reach the checkout line, they cast wistful glances towards the front windows, sensing liberation on the other side of the posters covering them. Like a scene out of a movie.

As I grabbed my collar and dragged myself away from the supermarket, I'm reminded that life is not, in fact, a Hollywood movie – no matter how many times we describe it that way. 'It was like a scene out of a movie' has become a ubiquitous cliché, often used as a lazy shorthand to describe anything that's even remotely surprising or unusual. Everything today is 'like a scene out of a movie.' Perhaps it's time we stop letting scripts dictate our lives and start living them. But what does that phrase even mean? Are we so detached from reality that we need to make every moment sound like a Hollywood special effects sequence? Or are we just too lazy to come up with something more original? Have we become so accustomed to parroting the familiar tropes, clichés, and idioms that permeate our shared cultural lexicon? Is this the reason for  a proliferation of phrases and expressions that are endlessly repeated in everyday conversation, social media, and media outlets? We have lost our capacity for genuine observation and description.

Perhaps it's time for us to start living our own reality – and experience life like a moment from real life, with our own thoughtful narrative.",1,1735561472.0,CuriousThinker,0,1.0,False

Personally I think I have about 3 modes:

😖 “argh, that’s bright, get it the f away from me”(e.g. sunlight glare, sad light therapy lamp, xenon vehicle headlights) - I would say most people have this one. 


😩”this light is gradually eroding my wellbeing and patience, especially now I’ve noticed that it is” (e.g. most overhead lighting, the “big light” in any room if it’s not dimmed or an uplighter, strip lighting, office lighting, lighting in shops and stores etc).


😳”this light just has shut down part or all of my capacity to function, possibly without me realising it”(like when this morning I spilled coffee all over the worktop because a sudden blast of sunlight made me very briefly unaware of having a body). I think I also get this one in clothes shops where the store is quite dark apart from really brutal overhead spot lighting. I suddenly can’t function and have to leave.

I am stopped with drinking my 1 espresso a day 17 days ago.

Unfortunately had the feeling I had to do it now. I got racing heartrate and some dizziness after drinking espresso’s lately.

But the moment I had to stop wasn’t the best moment for me. I have some work issues to work out, and some relationship issues. And I always have some sort of seasonal depression during winter. 

I didn’t want to stop during this winter, but was planning to do this next summer. 

But since day 11 or 12 I’ve got some extra issues. I’ve got a wild insomnia, which I never had in my life. It takes ages to fall asleep and I wake up multiple times and then it takes ages again to fall asleep again. 

And I also got tinnitus in both my ears. Never had this before. This is also since day 11 or 12.

So I sleep a few hours a night and don’t get my necessary rest. 

At the moment I am not sure what to do. Since the problems in my life at the moment, I can’t go without my sleep for way longer then this. 

Can you guys give me advice what I need to do?

Hope all is well! The life of being single near the holidays always has me swiping on the apps or lurking on reddit 😂 So here's another post where, I usually end up rambling about myself (red and green flags and all) So cheers to everyone here and let me talk to your ear off.

Before I charm you with my wit (from the large amount of editing that I can do behind the screen) - physically I'm 5'8"", Chinese, average weight ~165lbs.

Not doing much for New years so always down to find someone to chat with or game the night away with! Anyone got any fun New Years resolutions? Besides the classic, get healthy, meal prep, do new things, read more.. I'm gonna try my best to get my parents off my back about being single for too long. So hello out there single ladies, I'm here ready to be cuffed 🙋

Looking out for that best friend with - someone to cook with, laze around with, or try new things! like shopping for clothes or random gadgets, axe throwing, puzzle rooms, museums, all that jazz. Though, I'm definitely a introvert, who needs some time to let the social battery recharge. Help drag me out to new places! I need someone to go watch Hadestown on Broadway with!

Besides that, I've definitely fallen off the bandwagon on my most recent health kick, but have been getting back into it - goal is lose weight, gain muscles! Maybe lose the dad bod eventually (though I know some people love it) .. but if you do have some healthy meal prep you like to make ( high protein low calorie) hit me up! I've been a big fan of chili so far.

Hobbies wise, there's a 95% chance that I'm probably watching TV, reading, playing video games, or cooking 🤓.

5% chance that someone's dragged me out of my cave to go rock climbing or outside to touch grass.

I definitely gravitate more to the gamer side, but I call myself a super nerd. Cause I play, read / watch:

video games (TFT, WoW, and soo much more)
anime, manga / manhua
Korean dramas, reality TV, anything about cooking, survival shows
books (Wind and Truth anyone?)
DnD
and that's just the tip of the iceberg (maybe)
You might be able to tell I'm a little bit of a homebody. Discord and media has definitely made it so comfy to stay at home... but, with enough convincing, I've been known to venture out into the unknown.

Here's a picture of me at a Spartan Race (that I definitely did not sign up 4 days before the race) https://imgur.com/a/SIIYGiN

There is a lot of meme potential in some of the photos of me from the race that I will hold out from you for now... So hit me up if you wanna see some 😂. I might bargain with you for a selfie of yours though

Anyways, that's a little bit (or a lot) about me. If I've piqued any interest, feel free to send me a message! I'm mainly looking for someone in the area, but let's just chat and see what happens! Hopefully our conversations won't dry out and we'll hit it off and be one of those success stories ☺️. But let's keep that a secret (we definitely met on Hinge). Also if you're not single, please help me with my flirting skills, those are definitely non-existent lmao

1hpm06z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Camus_wept/comments/1hpm06z/sleepless/,Sleepless,"I'm not sure why, but I just couldn't fall asleep tonight. My brain refused to shut off. The ADHD, maybe, or the lack of bedtime routine while on break from work. Maybe I took my stimulants too late in the day today. I guess it doesn't really matter why, what matters is that I couldn't sleep no matter what I tried. 

So now it's five a.m, and I'm cleaning the bathroom. Just letting the comet powder sit for a minute before I wipe out the sink, then I'll clean the mirror. I'll wait until it's a normal time to be awake before I do the tub, so I don't wake the neighbors by running the shower. 

I wanted to go out to a ski hill tomorrow. Or today, rather. I don't think that will happen, I expect I'll be mostly down for the count, even if I do manage to get any sleep. 

I'd hoped making myself get out of bed and do something would help me feel tired. No such luck, all I've gotten out of it so far is a headache from the bleach smell, and a marginally cleaner bathroom. But it is sort of nice, to use this time productively instead of uselessly tossing and turning in bed. 

It's also reminding me of cleaning your bathroom. How I'd done it as an expression of care and love, doing something for you, to take it off your plate, while you made a meal for us. How it was so much easier to do that while I was caring for someone else, instead of doing it for myself. I'm trying to move away from that, a little, and towards treating myself as someone I care about, too. 

I still have a ways to go, my depression nest can still be described as such, but I'm unraveling it bit by bit. The real trick will be keeping it from happening again once my apartment is presentable. That's always the hard part, being consistent. 

It's time to go wipe out the sink. Then I'll see about getting some sleep. Or some coffee. Depends on how the next hour goes.

I’ve been thinking about this while dodging another swarm of Glyphids and wondering why the hell I’m still risking my beard for Morkite. What if Mission Control is actually an **Orc**? And what if this entire corporate operation, Deep Rock Galactic, is secretly being run by a bunch of shady **Elves**?

Sounds crazy, I know, but stick with me.

# Mission Control = Orc Energy

First off, let’s talk about Mission Control. This guy’s whole vibe is *so Orc*. Gruff, no-nonsense, always barking orders like you’re a slacker just because you took five extra seconds to pet the Loot Bug. He’s got that “middle manager with anger issues” energy, but it goes deeper. Look at him—he even **looks like an Orc** with that lighting, the bulky build, and the permanent scowl.

Orcs were born to manage stuff like this. They don’t care about your feelings; they care about efficiency. They’re the perfect enforcers for a big, shady corporation like DRG. Who better to keep us dwarves in line than someone who’s just one coffee spill away from flipping a desk?

# The Elves Are Behind It All

Now, let’s get to the real villains: the **Elves**. Think about it. Who else would have the brains and arrogance to set up a galaxy-spanning mining operation and exploit the hardest-working, beer-loving species in the universe?

1. **Elves Love Exploitation**: The Elves probably sat in their boardrooms (which are definitely made of polished white stone with leafy vines everywhere) and thought, “Hmm, how do we make money without getting our hands dirty? I know—hire the dwarves to do the digging and the Orcs to keep them in line.”
2. **Environmental Hypocrisy**: You know how Elves are always preaching about preserving nature and harmony? Yeah, that’s because they don’t want *their* hands dirty. Meanwhile, they send us down to Hoxxes IV to strip-mine the place and annihilate the local ecosystem.
3. **The Real Profit**: All that gold, Morkite, and whatever else we’re hauling back? Do you think we’re getting the real cut of that? Hell no. The Elves are selling it to some shady galactic buyers and rolling in space cash while we get… free beer.

# The “Beer and Brotherhood” Distraction

Speaking of beer—doesn’t it all feel a little… too convenient? The Space Rig has a fully stocked bar, endless pints, and a vibe that keeps us chanting “Rock and Stone!” instead of asking why we’re getting sent into certain death for barely any recognition.

It’s genius. Keep the workforce drunk, bonded, and proud of their work, and they won’t start thinking about how **Karl probably died because DRG refused to send a rescue pod until he hit the quota**.

# Hoxxes IV: The Biggest Scam

Now let’s talk about Hoxxes IV. That place is a nightmare. You’re telling me it’s totally natural for a planet to have bugs the size of a drop pod and exploding plants? Nah, man. I think the Elves knew exactly what they were doing when they found it. They saw a resource-rich deathtrap and thought, “Perfect. Let the dwarves deal with the bugs.”

And you know what’s really gonna mess us up? If we dig deep enough one day and find **Elf ruins**. Just imagine: ancient Elf tech hidden at the core of Hoxxes IV, proving they’ve been running this whole operation for centuries. Mission Control would immediately cut us off with, “Stay focused, miners. Get back to the Morkite.”

# Why Orcs and Elves?

It makes perfect sense. Orcs do the dirty work of yelling at us and keeping us on task, while the Elves stay hidden and rake in the profits. The dwarves are the perfect workforce: brave, loyal, and fueled by beer. And as long as we keep chanting “Rock and Stone,” the whole system keeps running smoothly.

**TL;DR**: Mission Control is an Orc. The Elves are secretly running Deep Rock Galactic. They’re exploiting us dwarves for profit, destroying the ecosystem of Hoxxes IV, and distracting us with beer and catchy slogans. One day, we’ll dig too deep and find out the truth—but until then, Rock and Stone, I guess.

**EDIT**: Okay, maybe I’ve had one too many Glyphid Slammers, but tell me this doesn’t make sense. **You can’t.**",9,1735560722.0,DeepRockGalactic,0,0.91,False
1hply2b,https://i.redd.it/aaag5ps19z9e1.jpeg,the warehouse sale got me 😭😭 my first time w all these products + yapping some opinions down below ,"i’ve never owned a bdc before and i gotta say i’m IMPRESSED with how well it moisturises my lips. i do have some individual opinions on each of the lippies though - 

lavender: she’s great, nice pinkish purple tint. the fragrance isn’t so strong but if i were to smell it up close it’s quite waxy/crayon-y but not in a bad way. 

espresso: a weird observation i have with the bdc duo is that it literally smells like the cereal, koko krunch?? (anyone that grew up in SE asia know what i’m talking about??) mind you, i haven’t had koko krunch in over a decade but it’s does remind me of my childhood 😅 not so coffee-like but a sort of artificial chocolate with milk powder. 

unfortunately it’s my least fav due to colour on my lips, looks a bit liked i smeared melted chocolate on them but it’ll defs work better on people with darker lips. i’ll probably use it over a dark lipstick for extra gloss.

biscotti: defs a more no-makeup product i’ll use as it gives my lips a light brown glow that’s a bit closer to my skintone (G8-9). the smell is pretty waxy/crayon-y with a sweet caramel note. not as elegant as i’d hoped for but it’s not revolting.

the ultra lip in pony: SHE’S THATTTT GIRL. i was worried i would be a bit too dark for the shade but she makes my lips look 🫦 such a gorgeous & natural glow, i fully converted from clinique black honey. my only gripe is the lid keeps falling off (and it was partially off when i received my order oops).

— as for the non-lip products —

the lash kit: to be honest, i just wanted to try the mascara without getting the curler but it was more expensive to get it separately.

imo the curler SUCKS. it feels flimsy and cheap, there’s no ‘bounce’ to the press, and i pinched my eyelid trying to curl my lashes. i have much better & cheaper boots (UK pharmacy) curler that i’m still going to use.

the mascara is lovely though, it definitely elevates my lashes in a way that isn’t over the top, doesn’t clump, and looks very clean. it reminds me of clear mascaras that i used to have in my teenage years.


future dew solid vs. haloscope: i’m putting these two together because they’re pretty much the same thing. future dew is more wet, while haloscope has a lot more sheen. for both, if i already have my makeup on, i’d worry about the drag as there’s a bit of friction on application. i would probably dab some on a finger and dot the product in ✨the glossier way✨

you (solid): it smells as concentrated as the the liquid, but really doesn’t have much sillage on application as expected. i can’t really smell the top notes, it goes straight to the mid/base notes of pink pepper and woody musk.

it’ll be nice for a touch-up but i would pair it with the liquid you or use it to layer with another complimenting scent :) 

thanks for attending my ted talk if you read this far. would love to hear you guys yap too xx",23,1735560712.0,glossier,1,0.97,False
1hplxno,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1hplxno/is_lead_generation_tool_still_a_good_research/,Is lead generation tool still a good research direction for a SaaS startup?,"I just quit my marketing position before Christmas and plan to have a good rest before entering another role. However, someone in the tech industry invited me to join their small SaaS startup. Their product is scheduled to launch in Q1 2025, and it’s a lead generation tool. To be honest, I’ve never had much knowledge about this type of tool. After having a cup of coffee with the founder, I could sense their confidence in the product, but I still have doubts about whether joining such a startup team is the right choice. 

I’ve already done some research on lead generation tools and learned that there are existing options available, such as Leadfeeder, LeadsRebel, and LeadsNavi. While I can’t provide detailed insights into the product, I would say it will be somewhat similar to LeadsNavi, which tracks visitor IPs on clients’ websites and captures some details. The startup’s product may offer a slightly broader range of features at a lower annual price (but the monthly plan will be higher than the competitor). From a marketing perspective, I think it might work if they could target an actual pain point. However, since I’m not very experienced with the tech side and am new to SaaS, I’m wondering if this kind of tool is still a good direction for a startup. Should I accept the offer?

Many thanks in advance!",4,1735560669.0,SaaS,2,1.0,False
