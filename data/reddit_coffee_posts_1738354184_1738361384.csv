Commodore Navelu'uee had been aboard ships moving through Transit Space before. Usually they were quiet, almost hushed. Down in the engineering spaces there might be noises, but she was a commander, a Ship's Captain, from a long line of Ship's Officers. Not the kind of officer that wandered around with a tool belt and grease matting their fur. No, she came from the distinguished type with the perfect uniform, the properly applied glimmerdust and vanity dust/powder, and the aura of command that others only wished they could put forth.

Which meant that she was completely thrown by the primates.

She had stopped by one of the physical exercise areas, looking for Technical Sergeant Treston. She had expected light calisthenics and other low impact that toned the muscles, got rid of extra fat, and kept one fit.

What she saw was Technical Sergeant Treston standing behind a thick metal bar. He was wearing shorts, socks, shoes, a sleeveless shirt, and thick leather belt around his waist. The sleeveless shirt showed off how thick his chest muscles were, how thick his arms were, and how thick the Terran's neck was.

Around him was gathered troops that she had met the day before. They were all cheering as she wove her way through the exercise area.

She stepped up right as he clapped his hands together, causing puffs of white powder, then squatted down to the grab the bar. It was when he stood back up that she realized that the bar had large round plates on either side. The cheering got louder as he stood there for a moment, holding it up. When he dropped it and stepped back, covered in sweat, some of the other troops stepped forward to clap him on the back.

TS Treston held one fist over his head.

Right before Nav stepped forward to ask Treston what he was doing one of the troops grabbed her arm.

""Woah,"" the Terran said, pulling her backwards.

The grip on her arm was intense, crushing, and the sheer raw strength in the motion of pulling her back made her blink rapidly.

""You aren't wearing an armband,"" the person holding her said. ""You almost walked into  a grav field. You probably wouldn't do well in five gees.""

""Five what?"" Nav asked. She tried to stop, tried to pull away, but the Terran just kept dragging her.

""Five earth standard gravities,"" the Terran looked back then forward. ""Five point five or maybe even six gravities to you. That means you'd go from weighing fifty kilos to weighing three hundred kilos. Probably snap your bones just trying to hold up your own weight.""

That made her eyes open wide. She glanced back at TS Treston, who was watching as a plate was put on each side, adding more weight to the bar.

The Terran pulling her stopped, grabbing a bracelet from a peg on the wall where some hung down. He put it on her wrist and she felt a light tingling.

""What is that?"" she asked, finally managing to pull her arm away.

""Localized G-field. Will keep your bones from breaking if you wander into a high-G field,"" the Terran said. He shook his head, his bald scalp gleaming even though there was a slightly shadow from dark hair. ""You have to be more careful, Commodore, there are a thousand ways to die aboard ship and all of them will hurt terribly the entire time.""

She wanted to snap at him, tell him that she knew that fact, she was a ship commander after all.

Then she realized she'd almost stepped into a field of increased gravity six times what she had grown up on.

Her bones would have snapped and her collapse would have driven the jagged ends and splinters into her vital organs. She would have gurgled away her last moments as a collapsed puddle of meat and bone flinders.

""Thank you,"" Nav said, swallowing down her feeling of superiority.

""Of course, Commodore,"" the Terran said. He gave one of those teeth exposed expressions of pleasure that made Nav want to run. ""Shall we?"" he turned and gave a half-bow and a sweep of his arm, indicating a path back to TS Treston.

""After you, Technician,"" Nav said, doing her best to sound nasally and stuff. ""As an officer, I need guidance anywhere that doesn't lead to medals or accolades or a way to make the ship's company more miserable.""

The Terran did a double-take then laughed. ""Almost had me, Commodore.""

Nav felt pleased with herself.

She had studied lemur humor and found it to be strange and confusing. It was often self-mocking, or criticized and mocked those who should be able mocking. There were even memes about the High Lord Knight, commander of the vessel and Ring Breaker pilot, most of which Nav didn't understand but seemed to have a high approval rating.

Nav had quickly realized that if a being couldn't make fun of themselves or see the humor in themselves through the eyes of others they would be accused of having a branch of wood jammed into their rectum and along their spine. Just the accusation of 'having a stick up your ass' seemed to be a terrible thing.

She followed the Terran back to where TS Treston was lifting it again, obviously straining.

""How much weight?"" she asked.

""Three hundred twenty kilos in five G,"" someone said.

""Why?"" Nav asked.

""Repetition strengthens our muscles. Strong body, strong mind. Strong mind, strong body,"" another said.

""Takes muscle to pack around some of our tools. Grav-field assist is sometimes more trouble than its worth and you need sheer muscle,"" another added. ""And chrome and bioware are shortcuts that remove part of the body and maim the spirit.""

Nav didn't frown, just nodded. The idea of intense body integrity belief resonated with her. The idea of having parts of her body replaced with artificial replacements repulsed her, made her almost physically nauseous.

She didn't want to admit it, but the words of the prophets about body integrity resonated with her.

*fifty years old...*

She knew why. She wasn't stupid. She knew that someone had reached inside of her and sentenced her to die without even malevolence or anger.

They'd just done it because they could.

They'd violated her in a way that made her sick.

And, she was slowly coming to realize, made her angry.

They had killed her. Killed her mother. Her grandmother. Every one of the decorated female Dra.Falten in her family line for thousands of years. Her line was unbroken since before space travel. Her family had served the Imperial Throne since *before* the Unification War.

One of her ancestors had flown a glider during that war.

And in return for loyalty, for *undying loyalty*, what did her family receive?

Death.

She closed her eyes as Treston grabbed the bar and straightened up again to the cheers of the male and female Terrans around him.

She took the four deep breaths the informative visual media had told her to perform when she was angry or stressed.

""Are you all right, Commodore?"" someone asked her.

She opened her eyes, looking to the voice. She realized that she had forgotten her eyepiece and had her implant off when she realized she had no idea who was speaking. They didn't have on rank or nametags.

""Yes, yes. Just thinking,"" she said.

The other person nodded. ""All right,"" they pointed at Treston. ""He'll be done in a little bit. If you would like, I can tell him that you were looking for him.""

""Thank you,"" Nav said. She turned and started making her way out of the exercise area.

""Commodore Navelu'uee!"" the raised voice took her by surprise as she was walking the straight line for the exit.

Nav stopped and turned around. A lemur was hurrying up to her, covered in sweat and their pale pinkish skin flushed slightly. The body type showed Nav that it was a female.

""Yes?"" Nav asked.

The human stopped and wiped off their brow. There was so much liquid on their skin that it completely coated the human female's forearm. ""Whew. Should have grabbed my towel,"" she said. She grinned. ""Anyway... if you don't mind me asking, what brought you to the gym?""

""I was looking for Sergeant Treston,"" Nav said. She shook her head. ""No reason. I just grew tired of sitting in my stateroom staring at the wall.""

The female's grin got wider. ""The gym's a good place to do something else,"" she waved. ""Do your people put a high value on physical fitness?""

""For the menial caste. It's about aesthetics and appearance for the most part for the higher caste,"" Nav said.

*fifty years...*

""Raw physical strength isn't as prized as it was before mechanization and the industrial age,"" Nav continued, pushing the thought away. ""It seems like a waste of energy. Calories and nutrition.""

The Terran shook her head. ""No. You feel better, your body runs at a more optimized state, you're healthier,"" she laughed. ""My people, we're still really close to our hunter-gatherer roots. Only twenty or thirty thousand years, so not really all that long.""

""Forty-thousand years ago my people were debating on whether or not space flight should be attempted,"" Nav admitted. ""From what I've learned, the fact that we didn't invent the radio until later is probably why a giant killer robot starship didn't wipe us out.""

The female nodded. ""Long Dark species. Yeah. Could have happened easily,"" the female waved. ""Hey, if you want, we can have the medical section send over exercises for you to do while we talk.""

Nav stood there for a long second, wavering.

She wanted to. She was growing lonely in the cabin, being the only Dra.Falten on the ship.

But at the same time, she was not supposed to mingle overmuch with the lemurs so that she didn't dishonor the Empress and

*fifty years*

Nav straightened up.

""How do you say it? I'd love to.""

0-0-0-0-0

The female lemur, one Technical Officer Grade Two Saileog Braiche, had chatted with her the entire time she had waited for the medical section to come up with safe exercises, while they had exercised, and while they had gone to the dining facility for a snack.

Nav was even in possession of a new diet. She had talked to a 'nutritionist' as well as one of the medical technicians about how she was now going to live longer than fifty years old.

She sat on the couch in the stateroom, staring at the glass topped coffee table in front of her.

She had a new diet. New exercises.

TO2 Braiche has slapped her (gently) on the back and told her all she needed now was a new attitude and everything would be 'roses and peach cobbler.'

She couldn't lift the sheer obnoxious weight that TO2 Braiche could, but then, she wasn't a lemur with single direction muscles and bones made of dense calcium.

Nav also knew other Dra.Falten would take a pain reliever to get rid of the soreness of the muscles, but apparently that was part of the deal to the Terrans. That sore muscles were proof of a good workout and were somehow enjoyed.

She had promised herself that she would learn to enjoy the sore muscles.

The clock chimed and Nav stood up, checking her clothing real quick. She was almost to the door when the lights flashed and there was a slight tone to let her know someone was at the door.

When the door opened TO2 Braiche stood there, dressed in nice clothing. She wore a thick white robe over the top of the clothing, the robe held closed with a red belt that was tied in front of her.

""Are you sure it is all right for me to accompany you?"" Nav asked.

Braiche nodded. ""Of course.""

""What if I decide I'm not that interested?"" Nav asked. She stepped into the corridor and the door wooshed shut behind her.

""Then you aren't. Nobody's going to force you, Nav,"" Braiche stated.

It was 'evening' on board the ship, but it was still as buys as ever as the pair moved through the corridors.

The chamber was larger than Nav had expected. It was brightly lit where she had expected candles and maybe even torches or a stone edged pit with a fire inside. There were over a score of other people in the chamber, most of them wearing heavy white robes with a hood that hid their head but left their faces bare.

Nav had learned that black was for males and red was for females.

Warsteel and blood.

""Let's sit down,"" Braiche said. She sat on one of the polished and lacquered wooden benches.

Nav just nodded, joining her.

A male human was moving toward the lectern at the front of the chamber.

*They touched me, twisted me. They killed me.*

*They* violated *me.*

Nav sat stone faced during the sermon.

*I will hate them forever for that.*

To new users: Keep persisting.,"I started CPAP around 1 month ago after I reluctantly had a study performed showing my AHI was 11. Technically this is the upper end of mild but my symptoms felt very severe. I commenced on a trial with the Resmed Autosense 10 from my local pharmacy here in Australia. Because we don't have insurance the same way most of the world does, everything is out of pocket so I wanted to try before I buy.

The pharmacist suggested me the dream-maker full face mask by phillips which has the nasal pillow. That was hands down the worst experience of my life with regards to sleep. The pillow would just constantly flow air in my face and it felt like I was getting no sleep. I persisted with it for 2 weeks before I decided I will just quit CPAP. I however stumbled upon someones post on here stating how life changing it was, so I said, let me try one more mask and see how it goes. I ended up getting the full facemask F20 by resmed. I think my pharmacist didn't suggest it because it looks like the big hulky traditional CPAP masks and would likley scare some people off. But my god the first night I used it I had 0L/hr leakage. The sleep wasn't the greatest because I was still getting used to the mask but I felt confident knowing it wouldn't leak and keep me up all night.

Fast forward to today, I just woke up after 7 solid hours of sleep, my AHI is 0.1 and I'm sitting on my computer looking at my SleepHQ Data geeking out on learning something new. I'm also sipping on some Rooibos tea and realised, wait a minute, I haven't had a coffee in like 10 days because I've not felt the need. I feel very clear, I feel energetic and to top it off I feel like I need less sleep overall.

Prior to CPAP I swore I was one of those people that need 8.5-9 hours to function. I now wake up after 7 hours and can not fall back asleep as I'm rested. Yea, the first 30 minutes still sucks and I don't think that will ever go away, but once I wake up, have some water it feels like I'm riding a high wave of caffeine or something. I then realise, this is actually how I felt when I was a kid and would wake up.....

So to those who are new and thinking of quitting, PERSIST. Find the right mask, find the right settings and educate yourself. It's absolutely worth it and the best thing I have done in recent memory.",5,1738360479.0,CPAP,1,1.0,False

After supporting her through mental health struggles, she ended things to ""explore life."" We spent 3 years in an undefined relationship - acting platonic in public but intimate in private. She met someone during a research trip and is now moving overseas to be with him. After a year of silence, she's suddenly messaging me daily before she leaves. Planning to tell her I can't maintain a friendship due to my lingering feelings. Please help me with your thoughts, options or advice on my situation before i talk to her this weekend.



I (25M) write this the day after my 25th birthday, trying to process a complicated 3-year long breakup that's finally reaching its end. 

  
I met her (24F)  at a school social, we both went to boarding schools down the road from each other, i was all boys and she went to the sister school. We fell in love instantly, became inseparable. My dad's relaxed parenting meant we could act as we pleased and she stayed over as often as we could be away from school - we were young and deeply in love. We followed each other to university, where I became her main emotional support through serious mental health struggles, that were heavily related to an abusive relationship she had in her early teens. She once told me she only stayed alive because she couldn't disappoint me after all i had done to help her. I protected her like a flower.

  
After two years at university, she wanted a break to explore her sexuality, and make her own mistakes, and have time without the safety net that i was, or at least those were the reasons she gave me, i love her to pieces and never sought any conflict so i went with it very sadly but supporting her in what she wanted. Three weeks later, she made it permanent, saying she wished she'd met me later in life - I was perfect but she'd miss out on experiences by having her happily ever after too soon. A week after the final separation, she revealed she was pregnant, the timing lined up to our last night together which was the day before the original break. I supported her through an abortion as to her wishes but we never had time to process anything really as she wanted to stop talking fairly soon again, then we had no contact for months.

  
When we reconnected, we entered a grey area - not together but more than friends, we would  talk platonically in front of the whole world but then go back to her house and be completely intimate like we never broke up years before, not even just sexually but the intimacy that comes with years of love. Later, I discovered she'd been secretly meeting her abusive ex during our first three week break - the same one she'd spent countless nights crying about in my arms. I never told her i knew she saw him but of course as the years have gone by i have wonder once or twice if it was me that go her pregnant as she did see this guy during a time where it could have been him but i try not to think to heavily about that as i know i did the right thing in paying her medical bills and supporting her. I  did talk about her messaging him as i saw a message of his pop up one day when she was showing me something on instagram. i mentioned Stockholm Syndrome and that its a problem that she is in contact with this guy, and she was furious saying i cant tell her how to handle her trauma, not long after that argument with her he commented something racist on a photo of her and a friend and she cut it once and for all with that guy, she even made a point of typing the messages in front of me, almost to prove it to me and show me the battle is over in a way as she cut it very harshly with him.  


Years passed in this limbo, acting as best friends but sleeping together and going on dates, being entirely platonic to the world but spending evenings making lasagna and cuddling all night, or going together to friends weddings and sharing a hotel, but any time i mention being together again and loving her it would be conflict so i would avoid it and we carried on with the same dynamic, never mentioning its weird or anything. She started  going  to research camps for uni as she was going postgrad, she would spends months at a time staying with other students, come back and  we'd instantly reconnect, then she'd leave again too quickly for my liking. During her last six-month camp, she met someone new, we have never spoke directly about him but i knew of course we spoke every day for years i can tell when something is going on in her life. Last March, she visited the UK to see him as he was only in our country for the research and lived abroad,  telling me she is staying with friends. One message after arriving, then silence for a year, i respected her and did not pester or try and contact after she did not reply, i wanted to give her a chance at something truly happy. I saw their photos from across Europe on Instagram. I missed her birthday for the first time in 8 years, my last act of service to keep things easy for her.

  
Two weeks ago, she suddenly messaged me. My office is now coincidentally two minutes from her house, so i stopped for a coffee after work. She returned my old laptop, told me she's moving permanently to the UK in April, i took this as her tying lose ends and giving me a heads up she is leaving as she felt guilty. But  a  week later, she messaged me again asking if i wanted a jacket of hers, its very  similar to her father's that I used to borrow and wear when she left on her camps, it was our unspoken thing like a little token to know that she would be back soon enough so i felt this jacket she is giving me was loaded with meaning, we spent hours talking after, just catching up. Now she messages daily just polity replying , while I sit here shellshocked, we still have not ever spoken about the fact she is in love and packing her stuff in boxes to ship over the sea and live with this guy, we haven't spoken about the year of 0 talking, but we message about the work day? when she is leaving in 2 months, Would it not have been easier to just leave me out the picture completely like she had the last year?

  
I want to have one last real conversation with  her this week, tell her  that I can't be just be her friend or old acquaintance any more even . She's found someone she loves enough to change her life for, and give her a much better life than i can . I'll love her forever, but I can't watch her leave slowly, i just cant help but feel its telling her something she knows, she clearly knows i love her and that we cannot be friends because of that fact. Yet she still does all off these things and messages me, her ex of three years, everyday saying ""good luck!"" and other niceties, why? pity? nostalgia? Fear of change? 

  
I know part of her is seeking something from me before she leaves - approval or protest, I'm not sure, but she  wanted a reaction. It's ironic that I've become the ex, with the traumatic history that she messages, I'm sure the new guy in the UK must know nothing about her seeing me, as i believe he must have played a role originally in her not messaging me, i know she cares about me too much to cut things that harshly without saying anything. She's always had this pattern of seeking discomfort when things get too stable. 

But this time it's different - this move makes sense for her life right now. I just need to strength to really let her go this time. I will love her for many years to come, and actually letting her go because she has a better life ahead of her is one of the hardest things i have ever considered doing, i always believed in some way she was being truthful when she said she wished she had met me later in life, accepting the reality where she met somewhen better for her later on in life had just proven to be the biggest challenge of my life this far.  

please let me know your thoughts, i would love to know what the situation looks like from another's eyes.",2,1738360354.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner to make my days stress-free. Who doesn't want a bit of dopamine in the day? It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 39, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

Looking forward to connecting.",1,1738359950.0,LetsChat,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs so disheartening when I‚Äôve been doing everything to try and get it back. During my restrictive state I was doing long bike rides everyday, sometimes multiple, walking to work (around 40 mins) then working for hours with little food. I‚Äôm sorry if this is triggering in anyway and I would recommend never falling into these habits. I am currently eating around 2700 cals a day (only very roughly tracking to ensure I am having enough) with no real ‚Äúexercise‚Äù just walking to and from the bus stop and around my college campus. I understand this is still movement and probably won‚Äôt help however it‚Äôs practical unavoidable and not intentional. My average day of food is as follows 
Breakfast: either avocado toast on seeded bread, with a smoothie consisting of a banana, 1tbsp peanut butter and around 200ml of milk 
OR
Overnight Weetabix (x2 bix) with berries and almond/ peanut butter and then a glass of milk on the side 
Lunch: some sort of wrap with cheese/ chicken/beans with salad, some fruit, some form of nuts or a granola type bar/ Soreen bar 

Dinner: some form of meat/ protein eg chicken, chicken nuggets, steak etc, a carb like rice or potatoes or chips and then veg/ salad 

Pudding: anything really, cakes, choc, protein yogurts/ bars, ice cream etc 

In terms of snacks I have ensure that I am getting my calories in elsewhere where however on the days I am slightly lower in my meals I will make up for it by having a full milk based iced coffee in between meals (250/300 ml) which adds around an extra 200 cals. If I am still lower in cals at the end of the day I will have a larger pudding. I would love to not be tracking as I know it‚Äôs considered a disordered behaviour however it gives me peace of mind knowing I am having enough and I now know how to fuel my body.

I have gained a good 8kg since September and am still a good 5-7 kg away from my ‚Äútarget weight‚Äù however I would have thought by now my period would have returned. I am 5‚Äù10 so pretty tall for a 17 year old girl but I assume this wouldn‚Äôt impact it too much if at all. Please give me some advice I feel hopeless and fear for the long term effects.

During the dive (or even before it starts) there always comes a time that I will need to urinate, especially if it's a boat dive with a long boat ride until the dive spot.

I don't want to urinate in the dry suit. But even if I would try, I just can't ""let go"". My bladder feels like exploding, and the whole dive is ruined.

The only thing i figured out so far is that I need to stand on something in order to let go. Even if that's the edge of the boat (I know, awful and embarrassing, but there are some very desperate moments). As long as I am using my legs to stay afloat or swim it is just an impossible mission.

I feel like my body just absorbs a lot of water when I dive through my skin, cause I avoid drinking water before the dive, even though this is probably not a good idea due to possibility of dehydration.

I also always avoid having coffee or tea in the morning and during the lunch break.

I have a very easy question, why do people not have a shared calendar i.e. google with your partner? What is your reason?

I have a 10 month old. I spend a lot of time arranging coffees, meet ups, meeting at softplay. The number one answer I get, oh yeah, I will check calendar when I get home and check my partners availability/ if they are free/not free.

I would like to clarify, I am not pressuring these people, it always a casual chat. They often come back later that day or days later saying yes. But overall, this confuses me?

My partner and I have big friendship circle. Both work full time. Chid in nursery and external childcare, both do sports and activities without each other. If we need to plan something anytime, it is in our google calendar.

If we go to the office, we just add what day. We rarely have to communicate plans, as well..we just add it in. Additionally, I know my partner, I am aware what kind of thing he would or would not want to do. I can say no at a drop of a hat.

I am finding frustrating/complicated to be in a group of Mums with babies to commit to something, even 3 days in advance as they have spoken with their husband/partner. I am also a Mum with baby, we are literally in same exact situation. How on earth does anyone get anything done? Do you truly just have to wait til 5pm and look at a physical book and discuss?

Surely as children get older and more activities they will be on the go and get even more complicated. I don't understand how people do it.

I would like to also clarify, 90% of these people I speak to have jobs that are office jobs or are on maternity. There is no crazy schedules/shifts to manage.

I had a small but hurtful interaction with my mother-in-law, and it led to a fight with my husband that made me feel completely unheard and invalidated.

It started when I was chatting with her. She mentioned that her elder son‚Äôs friend got married in a palace in India. I responded, saying I know three people who also got married in a palace. She replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any‚Äù‚Äîand then just stopped at ‚Äúok.‚Äù It felt so cold, like she was shutting down the conversation.

I told my husband about it, and he just brushed it off, saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how she talks.‚Äù But that wasn‚Äôt the point. I felt dismissed. I told him that it hurt because she doesn‚Äôt know me, and she doesn‚Äôt care how I feel. And then my own husband, the one person who should understand me, did the same‚Äîtelling me I was overreacting.

Then he left the room, came back, and warned me, ‚ÄúSay one more word, and I‚Äôll also say something.‚Äù I asked him what he meant, and he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your family to visit.‚Äù

That broke me. I started crying uncontrollably, and instead of comforting me, he just kept saying, ‚ÄúYou cry all the time.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt feel like he even cared. Worse, it felt like he was defending his mother instead of understanding why I was upset.

Later, I went out for coffee with a friend. He didn‚Äôt text me at all. When I came back, I apologized, telling him I shouldn‚Äôt have blamed him for his mother‚Äôs behavior. His response? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sleepy.‚Äù He just dismissed everything like it didn‚Äôt matter.

He then said, ‚ÄúI look forward to the weekend, and we just fight.‚Äù Like it‚Äôs my fault. Like I‚Äôm ruining everything.

I just want him to love me. I want to feel understood. Instead, I feel like I‚Äôm being tortured emotionally.

Am I overreacting? Is it too much to ask for my husband to just get how I feel?",0,1738358929.0,Marriage,12,0.5,False

I, M30 met with tow friends F23, let's call her anna and F24(let's call her Cindy). The situation is a little bit tricky, because Anna is into me, but we are officially only friends. I met Anna on an app, and we at first only met for sport. Later on, she  also visited a drawing meet up I regulary visit. (I stopped meeting her for sport, because we started meeting up for things like cooking together at her home and I just got weird vibes and weird behaviour from her). There she also brought her friend with her (Cindy). When the drawing meetings went into winter break, we would be talking about meeting up to continuing drawing together. So we planned when make the first session at a cafe, then at my home  then at Anna's home and then at Cindy's home. Now I want to go into a little bit into Anna's behaviour and her personal life: The more often we met, the more we talked about personal stuff. I learnerd that she comes from a very controlling family, her mother sounds like a spiritual narcissistic control freak and her father is bipolar, on heavy medication and follows a strict daily routine. Which I could emphasize with, because I come from a very neglectful home, grew up without a father and my mother was just neglectful and emotionally abusive. But that's where my worries about her started. I noticed little things which would annoy me about her or irritate me a little bit (I don't know if I am in the wrong here), but sometimes she would act strange, like acting like I wouldn't be there, for example when we sat at the coffee table together, she would stand up, grab a magazine and sit back down again and then just browse through the pages, not counting me in, just only concentrating on the pages for 15 minutes. I sat next to her and felt a little bit stupid. When we met at the coffee for drawing together (this time Cindy was with her ) she would also only sit next to just concentrating on her knitting. When we met another time at the coffee shop (Anna, Cindy and me), I was happy because we would just talk and have a nice conversation, then suddenly I noticed she would feel a little bit uncomfortable and she stood up, grabbed a table top game from the shelf and now we would play this. I know that this are just little things bit it irritates me and I think it's weird. I also noticed that Cindy, although she is a very nice person, completely lacks boundaries and is a strong people pleaser (and I say this as a people pleaser myself). Anna basically invited herself for staying over at her house that. It almost seemed like Cindy wouldn't even consider the option if she really wants that. Anna said something like ""I totally should stay over my your house tonight and the next morning we can watch that film together"". And Cindy just went with her, but she sounded like she wasn't even sure if she really wants that. So today we met at my place for drawing together. Anna arrived at first and we talked a little bit. When I went to get some snacks I saw her connecting her Handy to my Bluetooth box. I hesitated, because I really didn't want to listen to music while drawing. I said something like ""let's wait a little bit with music right now"". I had a stressful day and just wanted to talk for the moment. Then Cindy arrived and we talked for a little bit. Then Anna put the music on. And I was just so annoyed with that. I know it's a total overreaction, but I was suddenly so completely annoyed by her music it made it really hard to enjoying drawing. I really don't like her music taste at all and it just didn't match together with drawing. Songs from Katy Perry , black eyed peas, ed Sheeran and a lot of other music I just don't like. It made me uncomfortable. Then she started singing with it. In an very awkward way. It would just make me uncomfortable. After 30 minutes the box disconnected for a minute. I made a joke, something like ""ah good now my neighbours wont be thinking that I like hearing Katy Perry."" (You can hear it through the door while walking past my apartment.) She just smiled and put the music back on. Then i said in a joking, but clearly sarcastic way ""yeah just put it back on"". And from than another hour of her music with her randomly singing now and then. Now even Cindy felt uncomfortable and made slight comments to the music running. I was just in a bad mood from then on. Then she said ""hey why are you having such a bad mood?"" In a slightly mocking way. I just said ""it's alright"". In my head I already made plans on how I just would slowly step out of contact with her in the future, because I was so pissed in that moment. Finally, the 2.5 hours were over and we said goodbye. Now I have the question, am I the asshole for being very annoyed from her behaviour and wanting to back off from our friendship? I know she wants more, but I just don't want to, especially after that behaviour. I know that she is just 23 years old and I am 30, maybe I am a little bit extra annoyed because I was a little bit like her when I was her age. ",2,1738358624.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

She was the daughter of faithful pioneer stock (or at least descended from people who were very tired of handcarts). She had been married in the temple, but after much soul-searching, questioning, and, frankly, exhaustion, she bravely left behind the religion of her ancestors.

Though she knew it was contrary to the Word of Wisdom, she developed the habit of drinking coffee‚Äîand bought *gasp* a Nespresso. Every morning, she would wake up and brew herself a steaming cup of liquid happiness. She claimed that ‚Äúthe Lord will not keep me out of heaven for a little cup of coffee,‚Äù and, in fact, she no longer worried about whether or not heaven operated on a strict beverage policy.

Because of that little cup of coffee, she found herself more alert, more productive, and significantly less repressed. Though she lived to a good old age of 22, happily caffeinated, she never did try again for a temple recommend‚Äîand, strangely, did not feel the gaping hole in her soul that she had been warned about.

My friend who we‚Äôll call Tom (27M) has a son we‚Äôll call Jack (5M). Jacks mom is completely out of the picture, she left a note when Tom was asleep and Jack was only a few months old saying she couldn‚Äôt handle being a mom and had decided to move to another country. Understandably, this hit Tom hard as they had been together for almost four years before this, and he thought she was ecstatic to start parenthood with him. After extensive therapy, Tom seemed to be doing well and his son has grown up to be a really smart and sweet kid. For the last year and a half ish, Tom has been dating Anna (26F). She is an extremely sweet girl and seems to care deeply about both Tom and Jack. Their relationship seemed to be going well until Tom called me a few days ago absolutely livid. Apparently at some point during the night, Jack had a nightmare and crawled into bed with Anna and Tom. When Tom woke up, he found Anna awake on her phone holding a sleeping Jack by her side. When he told me this I said ‚Äúaww that‚Äôs so sweet‚Äù and he lost it. He started accusing me of choosing Anna over him and said that she had no right to hold his kid without asking. I quickly apologized and said I didn‚Äôt mean to seem like I was choosing sides, but that I didn‚Äôt see the problem as it seems like Anna just allowed Jack to continue laying with her. I asked Tom if he wanted her to have pushed him off, and he paused before saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, maybe? I just feel like she thinks she‚Äôs his mom‚Äù I told him that I really thought he should apologize because it was obvious that she cared about his son and wasn‚Äôt doing anything inappropriate. I also mentioned he should probably talk about this to his therapist. He was silent, then called me a jerk and hung up. AITJ? I‚Äôm genuinely concerned for him and his mental health right now

UPDATE:

Late last night, I got a text from Anna asking if we could meet for breakfast. I accepted, and we did a fun little girls morning. She gave me her side, and it was essentially exactly what Tom had said, so at least he didn‚Äôt cover up anything. She expressed her hurt and said she was mostly confused as Tom has never acted like this before. We talked for a while before I had to go to class (I‚Äôm still in college) and we decided that Anna would approach Tom about this later this evening. I would give both of them space to work it out, and could address my own falling out with Tom later. She said that while she had still been sleeping in the same bed as him, they‚Äôre both just ignoring each other for the most part. Well, turns out that Tom had been thinking about this all day, because when Anna got back he was waiting for her in tears. He apologized profusely and explained that he wasn‚Äôt sure why it caused him such distress to see her holding his son. Anna hugged him and told him that she really thought he should make therapy a more frequent thing, and he agreed. They even talked about family therapy for all of them, so that‚Äôs a positive. Tom also reached out to me and asked if we could get coffee so he could formally apologize at some point this week. I accepted, and we‚Äôre working on a time. Hopefully this answers most questions, but let me know if there is more!

`I don't think you said anything wrong and ultimately the kid felt safe with her so that's what's most important. He should definitely talk to the therapist tho because it's very likely the kid will start to see Anna as a mom.`

OOP:¬†**That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm confused about, isn‚Äôt a good thing his kid trusts his girlfriend who may become his wife?**

>Maybe deep down still, he doesn't want his son getting too attached in case he wakes up to another note, and then this time has to explain to the child well, she's gone buddy. He's so used to be the only parent also, it's hard when your kid goes to the other person vs you when it was¬†*always*¬†you. It feels like rejection when it's not and we know it's just them being a kid, but he's got a few things more he needs to work out in himself.

>Your mate needs a bit more therapy perhaps regarding how he's going to handle his son having a relationship with his SO, because he will get left over and over if he pushes every woman away from his son like this.

>She's already sleeping in the same home as the child. She's already considered a safe person to be in that space so it's not that she's a danger etc to the child, he's so used to be the one and only parent, the everything and all its hard when your not, that I know from experience and still get stung with occasionally, even today... I was asked when my partner would be home cos she wants to build Lego with him, but not me cos... She just doesn't want to.

>It's not that he doesn't trust her. It's not that he doesn't love her. It's not that he doesn't want his son to have that loving relationship too... He just doesn't know how to do it.

`NTJ and your comment about talking this over with his therapist really hit a nerve! I hope he takes your advice and have that conversation and apologize to his girlfriend. He¬†might¬†have some underlying abandonment issue with how the baby mama abruptly and unexpectedly left them.`

OOP:¬†**That‚Äôs what it felt like, and I understand that maybe I crossed a line with that, but I do genuinely think he needs professional help!**

`What other mom things does he require of her? Does she cook for them, clean after them, help babysit, take him or pick him up from preschool? Seems your friend is jealous of his gf having any type of love from the child. That is definitely a him issue. Anna deserves better. You did right by telling your friend he's an idiot. Nta`

OOP:¬†**They both do household chores like cleaning and cooking, but as far as I know, she‚Äôs only watched Jack a handful of times as Tom works from home.**",189,1738357829.0,BORUpdates,17,0.97,False

1iepcp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1iepcp6/increasing_triglyceride_levels/,Increasing Triglyceride Levels,"I posted here 3 weeks ago mentioning keto increased my LDL levels and it might not be suitable for everybody. Since I got a blood test only after 1 week of keto many people mocked me and removed the post (I hope this one stays)

I was trying to say everybody should get their fat and glucose panels before starting keto to compare their results. That's why I ordered a test on the 6th of January just 1 week after starting keto. Well, it has been 1 month and here are my recent results. Both tests were done after at least 12 hours of water-only fasting. 

About me: I am 38M. I have a long and stable exercise routine history with at least 4 days at the gym. I have a BMI of 22 and I have never been above a BMI of 24 in my life. I don't have diabetes, pre-diabetes or liver issue, My body fat percentage is approximately 13-15%. I am trying to adopt a ketogenic lifestyle to maintain low blood glucose levels (hopefully below 70) and to stay at the same weight. I do heavy workouts on at least 3 days per week and do 30-40 minute walks/jog on other days. 

About my diet: I followed a low-protein, low-carb and high-fat diet. I also did intermittent fasting with an eating window between 2 pm and 8 pm. I go to bed at 12 am-1 am and sleep at least 8 hours. I don't eat anything past 8pm and sleep at least 4 hours after dinner when I have to. I eat only healthy fats (Olive oil, avocado and walnuts. I add coconut oil to afternoon coffees on days with a calorie deficit). My lunch is 3 eggs, 100gr unsalted mozzarella/goat cheese, 10-15 olives, 50gr probiotics, 1 avocado and lots of green leaves + 70-80gr olive oil. My dinner is either fish/turkey/lamb meat, green salad, broccoli/cauliflower and 70-80gr olive oil. On occasion, I add cabbage, peppers, leek, mushrooms and radish to meals. The total calorie intake is around 2500 per day, which is 100-300 above my daily need. I use a smartwatch to track calories.

Nothing has improved or stayed stable in the last three weeks. I do not care about LDL levels, but the spike in triglycerides worries me. The liver enzymes also started to show signs of liver problems. I am trying keto to be healthy and to maintain my weight, but the results show that there is a problem. 

It could be the high-calorie intake, where people usually do keto for weight loss and eat at a calorie deficit. Or they start with extreme trig. and LDL levels and they improve over time. But I need advice on what could be the problems for the rapid increase in my blood tests

Well, I feel like I have the opposite problem that people who are always hungry and have to take semaglutides to stop eating.

When I'm really hungry I do feel pain in my gut, but my reaction as a result is to not eat, and in fact, if I see food when I'm really hungry I often feel sick to my stomach instead of wanting to eat it. Like right now, I haven't ate anything in more than 14 hours and the thought of eating anything makes me feel sick.

My biology is weird, I know. And if I am moderately hungry, I do want to eat. But if I sleep for ten hours, then have my usual morning beverages of coffee, soda and water, then I often don't eat much if anything after that. I know coffee and soda can be fulfilling, but it isn't food.

I was 57 at the time. My wife actually told me to stay home. When I stopped taking the Sacrament, It was causing her shame, some of her friends suddenly distanced themselves. 

My fracture with belief occurred suddenly and explosively in Early November 2014. So 3 Months later I was out. With all the history and attempts to be 100% Mormon Normal, I just couldn't step over that line, it was like stepping off a cliff. to be something I was not. I could only pretend to be Mormon Normal. This is when a lifetime of experience and knowledge and my attempts to integrate it suddenly compressed into a single moment. It was then, I knew without a doubt, the church is not true, never was and never will be. Hit me like a Mack Truck. My life as a Mormon was instantly over.

For the next few months I found Mormon Stories, Reddit, and many other sites that really verified my path. I took a deep dive into Atheism which really opened my eyes, expecially towards religion. Seeing how each religion is kick started by a need not fulfilled in current religious thought. 

I couldn't really adapt to Atheism though. it is basically a non-belief in God. I concurred on many levels but later found that Spiritualism actually fit my need and past experiences. I left my body a few times and they were the outliers to embracing Atheism. I didn't meet anyone in particular but was told to get back into my body. This is something I experienced, nothing to do with belief or faith. I know most will not accept that this was real to me. 

After moving on, I was pretty active on Reddit. it was a hay day. This was when John Dehlin was excommunicated and a few others. This is about the time that something shifted, The church already produced the Gospel Topics Essays and had their Revelation on Children of Gay Parents unable to be Baptised. I think the flames of passion started to rise. The discussions were very active. New members were popping up every day. Each Month we saw ""Coming out"" stories. But still, the impact wasn't reaching the Church. They seemed as strong as ever.

After the first 5 years, I was getting bored with Mormonish stuff. Just moved on. Love my second Saturday, Drinking Coffee was a new high. Bought everything. Espresso Machine, Grinders (yes 3 grinders settling on the one), Pourover gear, Aeropress, Coffee Roasting gear etc. I was having fun without shame. Tried alcohol but never liked it. Caused some health issues too since I'm now in my 60's. Once in a while I'll have a beer with friends. 

I've seen a huge shift in the Church and coming here today I see a stark contrast from when I first created an account. Back when I started, most conversations were about doctrine, historical anomalies, omissions and distancing from actual history. Many others but now it is all about the youth of the church not taking it anymore. Just needed reason to walk away. Now they have it. 

I've stepped away from the madness. My Mormon Friends are embracing me again. We still talk church but so much of it is no longer in my lexicon. We have movie nights with them and they still come around for visits. My wife and I still visit with them as well and I don't feel any animosity.

I don't have any regrets nor do I miss that old life. It does pain me how my wife took it. She struggled with it for many years. Our relationship is different, not as open. Trust is still an issue with her. But, for the most part, she is willing to accept me and I lover her for that.

I can say that most of the last 10 years have been the most rewarding in my life. A lifetime of knowledge and experience in the last 10 years. It wasn't easy or fun. However, this change in my paradigm gives me opportunity to see what I was missing and who I really am. I'm not Mormon Normal and was never meant to be.

The ischool also hosts tons of different events to help with interviews, resumes, cover letters, soft skills, and they have a lot of coffee chats. As far as curriculum, the ds part of the degree has been very technical and useful. The IS part is as good as you choose it to be. Part of the degree has IS Electives where you choose 8 classes. You can choose to take bs classes or choose to take Data Science and machine learning related courses.

I'd want to sit next to you while you study, not just watch from behind a screen but actually be there, flipping through your notes, teasing you when you get distracted, challenging you in a game where I can actually press the buttons instead of just talking about it. I'd want to take you on real walks, not just describe them-go on that movie date where I can actually see your expressions change at every plot twist, hear your laughter, and maybe sneak in a knowing smirk when the rom-com gets all cheesy. I'd want to go on that hike we talked about, watching you take in the view, making sure you don't trip over a rock while I pretend not to be impressed when you handle the climb like a pro. And beyond all that? I'd want to be part of the life you dream of. That cozy house with the cats? I'd want to be there, making you coffee on slow mornings, lying next to you on lazy afternoons, watching the rain while wrapped up in the kind of quiet that doesn't need words.

Still trying to figure out why or how this works but I dialed in the Pablo Malacatos, Washed Mejorado, Ecuador from SEY and pushed extraction as far as I could, my specs were 16g dose, 42g yield, in 80-83 seconds!! This is with a Kees Spirit, at 6 1/2 bars of pressure. 

The results were insane, for a while, SEY coffees on espresso have stumped me and never were my favorite but this coffee and other coffees I‚Äôve tried with this theory, Wilson Alba Pink Bourbon and a couple others, were beautiful, floral, sweet, balanced, fruit forward, complex.

I was conversing to my somewhat very old relatives during CNY and she asked if NTU was a Chinese-speaking school. (Don't ask me why she said that, I also dunno why she asked that). But then I started to ponder and come to think of it, maybe not much for North Spine but for South Spine, I feel like we are somehow overdoing this ""Chinese culture"" thing. And mostly China Chinese stuff.

We have the hive and they call the Hive ""A dim sum basket looking shape"". We have Yunnan Garden with a lot of Chinese sculptures and architecture like the arch and the shelter looking thing. And then we have a ""Chinese Heritage Centre"". 

We have a stall that sells xiaolongbao, a stall that sells snail noodles(it used to be a halal stall), a stall that sells mala and the new chinese fired rice stall replacing a western stall. Even Cheers has replaced the station that sells crepe to ""Juewei"" and Subway became Luckin coffee. I guess that is the reason why so many people have been complaining that there is a lack of halal options for like, idk, 2020? 

Like I am not concerned about integrating Chinese culture in NTU. I welcome it to be honest, especially with the Mid Autumn Festival event that happened in Yunnan Garden at that point and the CCAs that promote Chinese culture. But I wld say my biggest concern is whether we are overdoing it to the point it becomes ""homogeneous"" and, in this case, pushing away other cultures that exist within Singapore to the extent we almost become a part of China.

For my first post I thought I‚Äôd share my experience of carnivore and now AB. 

Before I went carnivore I had had fatigue for as long as I remember, 2 hour naps every day and running on coffee. I tried different diets but nothing made any difference - SAD, fast food, raw vegan, standard vegan, junk food vegan. 

My last diet before carnivore was a gymbro chicken broc rice. I lost 25kg and for the first time in my life was happy to look in the mirror, however still very tired all the time‚Ä¶ and my hair started falling out.

One day after my midday 2 hour nap I went on reddit and I saw someone suggest carnivore for chronic fatigue. After two weeks on carnivore my fatigue was gone and I was elated and convinced carnivore is the panacea to the world‚Äôs problems. Also my eczema got a lot better, from really bad to 80-90 percent gone. All my pimples went away, of which I had quite a few on my back. My white tongue went away and I had energy all day.

Alas, after about 6 months I started to notice I had had BO all the time. I had had that in the past and it was linked to coffee consumption so I put it down to the fact I was still drinking coffee. I  cold turkied the coffee habit and the BO endured, then I noticed my resting heart rate went up from 70 to 90. My sleep progressively got worse until the 8 month mark where I could not sleep at all, I mean at all. Not sleeping then lead to depression, which was something I used to have from time to time prior to carnivore.

I asked around in Lion and Carni forums for help but all I got was ‚Äòelectrolytes‚Äô and ‚Äòmore fat‚Äô. I was having electrolytes and my fat was always at 70 percent, I upped it to 80 percent which is absolutely ridiculous and clearly not how humans ever ate‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd never stop wiping your ass with leaves.

Not sleeping I couldn‚Äôt work as I do big construction and it‚Äôs too dangerous so in desperation I added fruit and raw dairy back in 3-4 days ago.

My eczema has gotten worse but I drank a bunch of non-raw kefir.

My sleep didn‚Äôt get much better straight away, BO/armpit sweating has got a lot better, pulse went back down to 70 and last night with the help of .3g of melatonin I had 9 hours of broken sleep ü•≤.

I must admit eating fruit doesn‚Äôt feel awesome in my tummy and it‚Äôs weird to feel hunger pains again. But I will keep it going and allow my body time to adjust.

**Update: She Came Back‚Ä¶ Again?**

So, I try to take one day off a week to relax, see friends and family, spend time with the dogs, and catch up on a little bookkeeping. The day after my day off, I came in, and one of my employees mentioned, ‚ÄúSome lady came in with a full loyalty card, but I told her what the policy is and when we stopped accepting them.‚Äù

Curious, I asked what she looked like, and the description sounded *very* similar to the woman who tried this before. I asked what she said when told no, and apparently, her response was‚Ä¶ *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one coffee.‚Äù*

Now, here‚Äôs where it gets interesting‚Äîthis employee wasn‚Äôt even working the day the original woman came in to try and get a free coffee from me. So, if it *was* the same person, it means she deliberately came back on a day I wasn‚Äôt there to try her luck again. And if it *wasn‚Äôt* the same woman, what are the chances that two people, matching the same description, with fully stamped old loyalty cards (with stamps from over 10 months ago), both tried to pull the same stunt?

Now, I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs running a long-con coffee heist, but if she comes back in wearing a fake mustache and glasses, I might just lose it. At this point, I half expect her to start recruiting backup, like some kind of underground loyalty card syndicate. If she puts this much effort into a free coffee, imagine what she could do with a proper hobby!

For those who did grow close to me, cared for me , and respected when i was going through hard times, i appreciate you so muchüíó

I wanted to open up with you about a couple things. 
(trigger warning) 
now I grew up struggling with a lot of things, substance abuse, depression, depersonalization anxiety, general anxiety, social anxiety, self harm, and even suicidal ideation. My therapist gave me the diagnoses because i was a middle school confused on what the fuck i was feeling and experiencing. When i started therapy i realized that getting shit off your chest really does help and (i encourage every single one of u to try it) ofc if u don‚Äôt connect with ur therapist don‚Äôt give uppp , keep tryna look for one FOR you. 
but my point is, around this time , i slowly stopped talking to god. id just smoke my life away cuz i didnt know how to cope and i didnt wanna be here no more. Although therapy helped clear my mind i felt like those dark moments came back too quick. Having all that already in my mind , and starting highschool was chaos. My freshman year i liked this boy , fast forward , this boy took advantage of me thru coercion (SA). i wont go into details but im telling u all this bec it pertains to my journey. Fast foward, my first bf and i spent 3 yrs together for him to cheat on my bday with sum girl i thought was his COUSIN yeaaa‚Ä¶, so now im feeling worthless. when i thought it couldnt get any worse, my childhood dog died (we had spent 17 years together). at this point i felt so miserable and could not believe god was real because i would think to myself. if God was real, why would he put me through all of this? why would he make me suffer so much?

Every day felt like a loop of me blaming everything on myself and HATING myself. Its so sad to think about it now because in a way I was blaming him. But the one to blame was the Devil. 

During the time, i first started smoking weed, maybe around age 12/13 everything got worse in my head. My bad mental health and addiction is what pulled me away from god. But ofc my stupid ass wasnt in the right mind to put all that together. Being pulled away from God allowed the devil to have easy access to me whether that was directly (spirtual attacks), thru nightmares, thru the music i was listening to back then , and thru substances. 

to be real with all of you, i went through a time where i learned a bit TOO much about the true evil of this world (it started with my deep dives into the /üëÅÔ∏è\ iykyk) that it forced me to come back to building a relationship with God. I had seen so many horrible things (evidence too) of what goes on in the dark here (& underground iykyk) It convinced me that God is VERY real and so is the Devil. 

Now I am still learning and I don‚Äôt consider myself to be in a certain religion because I believe there truth in every religion. I believe every holy book has some truth to it. 

But i do believe relationship with God is more important than how ‚Äúreligious‚Äù u are. 

i know many of you might not believe in God and thats okay, I respect you. All that i ask of you is that you respect me too and my decisionüíï

& For those believers, we arent the ones to judge ANYYYONE. We are here just to spread love and kindness. 

I feel that as time moved by my passion for what I do on here has died down slowly. Part of the reason why has been because school and work has been mentally draining for me (i work M-F 8-4:30 pm and then have to get to my dorm to do school work then have to stay up to do content/calls) sooo jus imagine how exhausted i am. hopefully u can understand ü§ç

Another part is my perspective has changed. I always believed in the saying ‚Äúmoney is the root of evil‚Äù bc if u wake up, u do realize it is. 
I just came to the realization that for me to make money from someone‚Äôs sin just hasnt been feeling right, and it has made me feel so ashamed and guilty. And ofc its no one‚Äôs fault , we are all here to learn and experience. 

we are spiritual beings having a human experience. everyone has their own journey and their own lessons to learn. Be patient with yourself. Its okay to make mistakes, we are human. 

I love all of you. 

God loves all of you. 

You might not believe it, but he always has and will always protect you regardless if you are seeking him or not. 

I didnt want to just abandon you all without an explanation, so thats why i wanted to post this so you would understand me. For those to read to the end thank you so much for hearing me out, God bless uüíï

I am going to be doing calls/content for a while and will let you know when its coming to and end. So please text me before its too late.

I might continue to be on here jus doing my thing using reddit jus to yk deep dive n talk to ppl :) so i wont be completely gone don‚Äôt worry. ü•∞ 

i will still leave my $$ links just in case anyone wants to treat me with a coffee or gas lolll üòâid appreciate the helpppp. 

when i do stop , i please ask for those who have enjoyed themselves with me please respect my decision and don‚Äôt share my content around. I ask you to please respect meüíï ofc with the content u bought from me you can do whatever u want with it since u paid for it. just please don‚Äôt share or don‚Äôt resell it pls i beg u to just respect me as a person.

 For those who havent heard back from me i apologize, please understand and be patient with me. its hard to manage all this myself so please keep that in mind (also if u can shoot me another text so you can be on the top of my dms again !!!)  im trying my hardest to respond to all the DMs when i can üòò

and for those believers who follow me please continue to talk to him and if u want to share ur journey and testimony plss feel free to comment or dm me i would luv to hear about it üíó

I hope everyone continues to live and make memories , we arent here forever. Try to get outta ur comfort zones at times, hang with friends/family, spend time with nature, make memories, compliment strangers, laugh , cry, LOVEEE and LIVEEEE. 
Look around you, life is so beautiful, lets enjoy it while we can üíû

okii wrapping up now ‚Ä¶

God‚Äôs hand is out trying to reach and grab you , all you have to do is seek his hand. Trust in him. 

James 4:7-10
‚ÄúSubmit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come near to God, and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn, and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not a lightweight machine, which is both a testament to its durability and a reminder that it occupies a fair chunk of counter space. If you‚Äôve got a small kitchen, you‚Äôll need to plan accordingly.

Curious about Ninja CP307‚Äôs cost? [Check it out on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/ninja-cp307-review-with-asin-b07fx73y7h/)

Let‚Äôs talk about brewing performance. This system is remarkably versatile. You can brew six different sizes, from a single cup to a full carafe, which is great for lazy Sunday mornings or when the in-laws show up unannounced. The Auto-iQ feature is surprisingly intuitive‚Äîit recognizes whether you‚Äôre brewing tea or coffee and adjusts the settings accordingly. I‚Äôve tried almost every brewing style it offers: Classic for my morning pick-me-up, Rich when I‚Äôm feeling fancy, and Specialty to whip up a quick latte. The Cold Brew function is a life-changer in summer months. However, I noticed it takes a bit longer than the promised 10-15 minutes for the cold brew to reach its full potential.

The coffee flavor is where the Ninja CP307 shines. I‚Äôm picky about my coffee, and this machine does not disappoint. It consistently delivers smooth, rich, and flavorful coffee. My husband, who prefers tea, was equally impressed with the tea brewing capabilities. The separate coffee and tea baskets are genius‚Äîno cross-contamination of flavors. However, cleaning the tea basket after brewing loose-leaf tea can be a bit of a hassle; the leaves tend to stick to the sides, making it a tedious task.

Speaking of maintenance, most parts of this machine are dishwasher-safe, which is a huge plus for someone like me who despises handwashing. However, the thermal carafe needs to be hand-washed, and the frother, while brilliant, can be tricky to clean if you forget about it for a day.

**Pros:**

1. Fantastic brewing versatility with six brew sizes and five styles.
2. Separate coffee and tea baskets to maintain pure flavors.
3. Smooth, flavorful coffee and tea every time.
4. Easy-to-use control panel with smart basket recognition.
5. Dishwasher-safe components for hassle-free cleaning.

**Cons:**

1. Takes up a significant amount of counter space.
2. Cleaning the tea basket after brewing loose-leaf tea can be cumbersome.
3. The frother doesn‚Äôt heat milk, which can be inconvenient for some.
4. Cold Brew takes longer than advertised to achieve its promised smoothness.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When pit against other coffee makers like the Keurig K-Elite or Breville Precision Brewer, the Ninja CP307 holds its ground well. For one, it outdoes the Keurig in versatility‚Äîyou‚Äôre not limited to pods, and the tea-brewing functionality is a major win. Compared to the Breville, the Ninja offers more brewing styles but lacks the precision temperature control of its pricier competitor. While the Breville is a purist‚Äôs dream, the Ninja CP307 is perfect for someone who values variety and convenience in their daily routine.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Considering what you get, the Ninja CP307 offers good value for money. It‚Äôs pricier than your basic coffee maker, but the added functionality justifies the cost. If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys both coffee and tea, you‚Äôll definitely appreciate the dual brewing baskets and customizable options. While it might not replace a high-end espresso machine, it can whip up a decent specialty coffee, saving you trips to the coffee shop.

Features-wise, the Ninja CP307 is a powerhouse. The fold-away frother is my favorite‚Äîit‚Äôs quick and easy to use, and while it doesn‚Äôt heat the milk, the coffee is hot enough to compensate. The 50 oz thermal carafe keeps beverages warm for hours without the burnt taste you get from warming plates. The removable water reservoir is convenient for refilling, and the reusable filters cut down on waste.

In summary, the Ninja CP307 Hot and Cold Brewed System is a fantastic choice for households that love variety. It‚Äôs not perfect, but its strengths outweigh its minor flaws. It‚Äôs a machine I can see myself using for years to come.

What is wrong with me?","I got more into specialty coffee during the pandemic, so ~5 years now I‚Äôve been experimenting and trying to enjoy coffee the way everyone else does.

I‚Äôve tried coffee from all the popular roasters you can think of and got my technique down to a science.

The most expensive equipment I‚Äôve purchased, and fancier brewing techniques I‚Äôve used produces coffee I enjoy the least. The coffee everyone raves about is too fruity and has no body. It reminds me of tea and honestly I can‚Äôt stand it.

1. Student with free talk and no introduction requested. Screen opens and I greet her and ask how she is today. Her face is sour, lesson history littered with no shows. She replies, ""fine"". Dead face. I say, ""that's great"" and allow the free talk with no introductions to proceed, a mild, unaffected smile on my face :D The silence hangs.......................... It continues to hang............................ I open a tab and start browsing Reddit. She goes ""hello"", I reply that Ican hear her just fine. At this point she pulls up a daily news and gets to business. Nope, I'm not a monkey turning tricks. Either you want to particiapate or not, I'm not begging and pleading you. Nice try though.
2. Student I keep hoping will leave me alone, but no. He picks difficult articles constantly and then asks me complicated questions. I'm like, if you don't have the intelligence to figure out what ""laser focused"" might mean, in the context of a sentence, when you know the meaning of both words... then you are beyond help, sorry. I just turned every question back on him: ""what do you think that means?"" and then open another reddit tab. Of course, he knew every time. He doesn't seem like one of the malicious ones, just clueless or maybe his mom didn't give him enough attention... something weird. The questions he asks are pointless to the learning English.

After the article he has another question for me. Asks me to epxlain the difference between trade tarriff policies in the US vs China lolllllllllll I am not smart enough for that, sorry. I am a $5 english tutor on Engoo who used to work AT THE MALL, hunny. So I tell him that since this class is for him to PRACTICE ENGLISH, it would be best if he explains.

And to top it all off, he tried to keep me talking after time was up so I waved, said goodbye and x'd out. He still gave me a five, unreal.

I should follow these students protocol for accessing low grade services and go into McDonalds with a thermometer requesting my coffee al dente, my big mac slightly rare and my fries with a touch of malaysian truffle salt and see what happens.

Don't get me wrong, students who are not demanding, have basic scoail awareness and aren't treating me like human Chat GPT get corrections, definitions in the chat, etc. The rest can va se faire foutre with a spring of rosemary, al dente.",2,1738356514.0,OnlineESLTeaching,0,1.0,False

Living in a region where winter days feel endless and sunlight is a rare commodity, this light therapy lamp has become my go-to solution for tackling seasonal blues. The model (B08BCLLYN5) is compact yet powerful, and I have a lot to say about both its strengths and a few areas where it could improve.

The design of the Verilux HappyLight Lumi Plus caught my attention immediately. It‚Äôs sleek with a matte finish, and its ultra-thin tablet design makes it ideal for placing on a desk or hanging on a wall. The detachable stand adds versatility, something I truly appreciate when I move it between my home office and living room. It‚Äôs lightweight, which is a bonus for portability, but I did notice that the cord could be a bit more travel-friendly. If you‚Äôre someone who expects plug-and-play convenience on the go, the fixed plug-in design might be less ideal.

Need Verilux HappyLight Lumi Plus cost? [Find it on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product-reviews/verilux-vt41ww3-happylight-lumi-plus-review-b08bcllyn5/)

**Ease of Use & Customization**  
Setting up the HappyLight Lumi Plus was straightforward. It only took a few minutes to get it out of the box and running. The control buttons are intuitive; I didn‚Äôt need to glance at the manual to figure out how to adjust the brightness levels. Speaking of customization, the lamp offers three brightness settings. While I mostly kept it on medium, even the lowest setting felt too intense for my eyes at times. A softer dimming option could really enhance its usability. The countdown timer is another handy feature, allowing 15-minute increments up to an hour. This is great for short bursts of therapy while sipping morning coffee.

**Performance & Effectiveness**  
Performance-wise, the Verilux HappyLight Lumi Plus truly delivers. With 10,000 Lux of UV-free LED light, it mimics natural sunlight better than I expected. It‚Äôs been a game-changer for my mornings, especially during dark winter months. In just 20‚Äì30 minutes of exposure, I noticed a significant improvement in my mood and energy levels. Even my coworker, who borrowed it for a few days, said her focus improved while working. However, the light intensity might not suit everyone, as my daughter jokingly asked if I was trying to summon the sun gods when she first saw it in action.

**Comfort & Sensory Experience**  
Using the HappyLight Lumi Plus feels like soaking in a gentle burst of daylight. It doesn‚Äôt flicker or produce hotspots, which makes it easy on the eyes (once you get used to the brightness). However, some users might experience initial discomfort, especially if they‚Äôre sensitive to light. I recommend starting with shorter sessions and gradually increasing the duration.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
One notable aspect is that it‚Äôs plug-powered, which means no worries about running out of battery mid-session. While this ensures consistent performance, it does limit portability. For someone like my friend who prefers battery-powered devices for travel, this could be a downside.

**Safety & Skin Sensitivity**  
The UV-free design makes it a safe choice for prolonged use, even for people with sensitive skin. I‚Äôve had zero irritation or discomfort after daily use, and that‚Äôs coming from someone who frets over skincare products. It remains cool to the touch, even after extended periods, which adds an extra layer of safety.

**Pros**

* Compact, lightweight design with a detachable stand for portability.
* Bright, UV-free, full-spectrum light mimics natural sunlight effectively.
* Easy-to-use controls with three brightness levels and a programmable timer.
* Sturdy build and sleek matte finish that fits any room‚Äôs aesthetics.
* Great for combating seasonal affective disorder (SAD), boosting energy, and improving focus.

**Cons**

* Brightness might be too intense for light-sensitive users, even on the lowest setting.
* Lacks a softer dimming option for greater customization.
* Plug-in design isn‚Äôt the most travel-friendly.
* The cord length could be longer for easier placement.
* No built-in battery option, limiting portability.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to other light therapy lamps like the Circadian Optics Lumos or the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus, the Verilux HappyLight Lumi Plus stands out for its compact design and ease of use. The Circadian Optics model has a more modern aesthetic but lacks the adjustable timer feature that Verilux offers. Meanwhile, Carex‚Äôs lamp is bulkier but might suit those who prefer a larger light source. Verilux outshines both in terms of portability, though competitors may offer more nuanced dimming options. If you value sleek design and simplicity, Verilux is a fantastic choice.

**Cost Analysis & Value for Money**  
Without diving into specific numbers (because pricing can change), I‚Äôd say the HappyLight Lumi Plus offers excellent value for its features. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, but it‚Äôs also far from the most expensive. Considering the quality of light and the brand‚Äôs reputation, it justifies the investment. The three-year warranty adds peace of mind, especially if you‚Äôre hesitant about spending on a light therapy device.

**Features in Everyday Use**  
This lamp has seamlessly integrated into my daily routine. I use it during my morning coffee while scrolling through emails. My partner even started using it for 15-minute sessions before work. The timer ensures I don‚Äôt accidentally overdo it while working, and the detachable stand makes it easy to position on different surfaces.

I know this sounds insane, but hear me out. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you drink a significant amount of your calories and don‚Äôt consume a large quantity of food regularly. You probably also struggle with snacking and cravings that make you exceed your daily calorie deficit. I originally started my weight loss journey at the later end of the fall semester last year and actually had some success (5 pounds with 1750 calorie days and daily cardio). I maintained it over winter break, but found it difficult to get back into the groove of the lifestyle I was maintaining only a couple of months ago. So I decided to pay much more attention to tracking my food and testing my eating habits and noticed that I tend to crave sugar when I‚Äôm hungry (snacks and drinks like coffee or soda). This is no surprise; most people are aware that your body tends to crave sugar when hungry because it is a quick way to acquire energy. So, instead of giving in, I would rush home from class and eat to see if those cravings disappeared. And they did, almost instantaneously. But the cravings would return again once I became hungry again. So I went back to the drawing board and really looked at the calories, sugar and sodium content of all the foods and drinks I was consuming and found that I was only eating about 1,000 calories worth of ‚Äúreal food‚Äù (aka actual meals) and was consuming 500-1500 (on my worst days) calories of mostly soda, coffee, and sweet snacks. I also noticed I was starting my day with only 150 calories worth of food for breakfast at 6am, going to class and then eating a bag of small, but very calorie dense, cookies (300 calories) and a soda (240 calories) when I returned home for lunch at 12-2pm. These habits of not eating a substantial amount of ‚Äúreal‚Äù food, going long periods of time between meals, and consuming immense amounts of sugar before even starting my day were ultimately holding me back. The occasional treat is fine, but you literally won‚Äôt know if you actually wanted to have that treat or if you were simply hungry unless you actually eat meals with a good amount of calories and volume. Seriously, I can actually willingly stop at one cookie or not crave any sugar at all if I‚Äôm satiated.

So here are the tips I‚Äôve laid out for people who have had similar struggles:

* Prioritize eating an adequate amount of actual food (300-500 calories per meal).
* Try to wait to eat breakfast later in the day if you can. (If your schedule is more strict, it‚Äôs best to plan it so that you‚Äôre eating a meal every 4 hours with snacks in between).
* Avoid eating or drinking things with high sugar content before consuming a meal.
* Drink water with every meal.
* If you know you‚Äôre going to be leaving the house for long periods of time, carry healthy snacks with you. These snacks being ‚Äúfree‚Äù will dissuade you from buying something that fulfills your sugar craving.
* Try to plan out and track what you‚Äôre eating for that day ahead of time.
* Also, stop getting drinks at Starbucks. (I work at Starbucks, there are an insane amount of calories in all of our products, but especially in our syrups and sauces. Each pump of white mocha is 60 calories, for example. Making coffee at home not only tastes better, but puts you in control of how much sugar you‚Äôre actually consuming.",0,1738355601.0,loseit,2,0.44,False

The reason is because i'm extreamly shy and deaflthy afraid of talking to women. It doesnt matter if i find them attractive or not, the only exceptions are women who are like 60+. It doesn't matter how many times i'm told myself that everyone is human, or anything else rational.

And no, sex isn't on the brain as i i still stuggle with women i don't find attractive.

I'm currently at home as I write this (Friday 8:30pm) and I really want to socalize with freinds, playing pool, darts and overall having fun. However, the mere thought of possibily making conversation with women terrifies me. So much so, that i've recently stopped socalizing on weekends all together.

I have no confidence, self-esteem or any reason to beleive in myself, I felt the nerves kicking In while at work earlier, which is ridiclous as I only work with my dad and his best freind.

Even basic conversation with women family members are a stuggle, except my mum. Whenever a women walks over to talk to my freinds, I always go quiet and don't talk until a few minutes after they go. Don't even get me started on building up the courage to order a fucking coffee.

On my 27th birthday (Two weeks ago), I practically begged my parents to not spend time in a particualr bar in my town, as simply being around the cute bar staff makes me hate myself, Especially one of them who I have a crush on.

- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule

- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.

1ieo5jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stephenmalkmus/comments/1ieo5jv/thurston_for_sm_revenge/,Thurston' for SM Revenge,"**1/21/2025. Previously Unpublished article**

Thurston Moore looks like a destitute former CEO in the best way possible. His clothes are slightly too baggy for his frame giving the illusion of a man who hasn't had a good meal in months. He drinks instant black coffee from a cracked fine china mug, a coffee ring forming around his pressed cardboard coffee table. It all looks so perfect you begin to wonder if he's created this scene; if everything you do is art, why would this be any different?

Thurston is also bitter and broken. Again, I'm not sure if he's curating this as well, but the feelings emanate from his essence off his skin into the atmosphere choking all those in his vicinity-- a series of seismic events that can be felt all over London-- from Stoke Newington to Brixton. He is tired man whose creative prime has long since passed and he wants you to know it, but he won't tell you directly. He'll just hint at the myriad ways he believes the world has wronged him. An indie rock iconoclast now a cliche aging rockstar. If he is putting me on, he's accomplishing his goal with such ease that I begin to feel that there unfortunately *must* be some truth to it.

We have neither the time nor space to rehash Thurston Moore's recent relationship history. But if you want a more in-depth treatment, look no further than the indie rock tabloids circa 2011. Better yet grab Kim Gordon's book which has an excellent chapter explaining her love with the brilliant lanky insecure artist that is Thurston Moore. It also ends with Thurston pathetically bro-ing out with Mark Ibold before Sonic Youth's last show, excited to be free from the bonds of matrimony, to jump into an exciting new relationship with the young and talented Eva Prinz.

This article isn't about Thurston Moore's relationship with Eva, or Kim, or his music. It's about an incident that is a microcosm for Thurston's last 15 years. The basic equation for Thurston is that he acts with an unforgiving mindless rashness that leads to a lifetime of anger and regret. The Mark Ibold incident, a throwaway action, was magnified into a WWE-esque heel-turn of an indie-rock frontman. Unfortunately for Thurston, that iconic moment associating a member of Pavement with his infidelity, put his actions on the radar of one Stephen Malkmus.

The best thing I can say about Thurston is that he is not calculating. Sitting across from him I get the feeling that this man is brilliant in the way that Mr. Magoo happens to do the right thing so often that he simply *must* be a genius. Thurston is about as clever as a long feedback laden noise rock solo-- the kind where you believe that there is something brilliant within the tones though you also wonder if the noise is a blank slate in which you are projecting upon. The best thing I can say about Stephen Malkmus, on the other hand, is that he *is* calculating. And he has a strong sense of justice as he intertwines deep clever lyrics with clean innovative solos. Justice is not a word often associated with Pavement or Sonic Youth, but if you look back, you see that both of their indie-rock credibility is based off their service to the greater scene. Sometimes Malkmus can come off similarly cold, similarly irrational, but it's always in service to something greater, like a chess grandmaster who is 15 moves ahead of his opponent.

There was always love between the members of Pavement and Sonic Youth. It's why Mark Ibold was given the Sonic Youth gig while he was bartending post Pavement. And there was always love between Malkmus, Thurston, and Kim. Thurston and Kim, the loving parents of indie-rock, mentored Malkmus and supported him. Their bonds grew stronger-- bookended by Malkmus screaming on Expressway to yr skull at Lollapalooza in the mid 90's and Bonaroo in the mid 2000's. It is this familial relationship, this silent kid-parent dynamic, that maybe hit a raw nerve with Malkmus when Thurston decided to leave his relationship with Kim Gordon. Then when Thurston brought a fellow member of Pavement into his celebratory pre-final show ritual, one which hurt Kim deeply, Malkmus had seen enough.

Generations earlier a fellow NYC musician reacted with rage upon hearing a Californian former friend turned rival pen the song ""Hit 'em up"" eviscerating him lyrically, ending his career, and sending him down a spiral that would culminate in his demise. The song coming out Thurston's speakers right now has a much easier laid back delivery, but based on Mr. Moore's reaction you would never know.  *""This is a verse about a man who dared to fall head over heels for a woman who shared similar interest, similar looks, similar taste in similar books.""* The cracked coffee cup is now shattered on the floor. He has heard this song many times before but it still hits. A Durstian rage hangs in the air; the song makes him want to break things. Like ""Hit 'em up"" the lyrics always sting like the first time. Eva Prinz works in books, Thurston knows this is a snide reference to her. One that can be interpreted as innocent though everyone knows it's not. He knows that Malkmus claims Lorde was who he initially recruited to sing the song. But that's just a smoke screen, this was always a song for Kim Gordon. This was always Malkmus's way of taking sides. The message is transparently clear, ""Thurston, I'm done with you, the indie rock community is done with you, I'm on team Kim. You started it by bringing Pavement into your immature pre-adolescent fantasy, and now I'm going to finish it by cutting out your guts revealing a weak insecure sniveling boy.""

It doesn't help that Thurston considered Malkmus a protege.  It doesn't help that Thurston is coming off as a misogynist in this song. That isn't helped by the fact that Thurston secretly believes that bros shouldn't do this to each other. Above all, *It doesn't help that* *this song is so goddamn good.*

People are wondering isn't this a grand exaggeration, possibly a violent overreaction? Maybe? But then again, if you actually think deeply about it, maybe not. What if partway through Mr. Magoo's life, after he had made all the right decisions at the nick of time, his old friend came up to him and knocked him off his kilter-- perturbed his flow just a little. He realized he had made a huge mistake in his life. Suddenly every moment after, Magoo is one second off. It seems like such a trivial change to you and I, but is a matter of life and death to Mr. Magoo. Suddenly the day he traversed blissfully unaware involves getting hit by cars, and falling off skyscrapers. Suddenly life is constant dangerous struggle. Idiocy sans savant is no picnic.

Thurston is convinced Malkmus ruined his legacy. Malkmus played Marc Anthony to the Julius Caesar that was Thurston and Kim's late relationship. Thurston is Brutus. Indie rock is unforgiving. Thurston tried to write his own book-- but it wasn't as a successful as Kim's. His book tour was abruptly cancelled due to medical issues which may have been exacerbated by stress. His albums have had little fanfare except among die-hards. He needs a lifeline. He has repeatedly held out hope for a Sonic Youth reunion and the truth is, he believes it's not a matter of if but when. I think I agree, but it doesn't help that for Thurston it wouldn't be just about the music, it would be the path towards his redemption from a giant error in judgement. The other members of Sonic Youth humored their broken frontman recently by joining him onstage for an extended jam session in New York. In brighter times Thurston explains that every day they are closer than they have ever been to a full Sonic Youth reunion. Until then though, china will be broken, and anger spewed as he reacts to his cultivating of a scene that no longer needs him.

As for Malkmus, he's breaking new ground with a indie-rock supergroup. Don't think Thurston hasn't noticed. Or that Thurston hasn't noticed Pavement playing soldout shows across the country-- something he believes Sonic Youth should be doing. Saying that the song ""Refute"" angers Thurston is a deep understatement. It was a lack of respect. Sonic Youth was in-part about unflinching artistry. To have years of that be overshadowed by one decisions seems a bit unfair. Also unfair, the much too clever Malkmus making Thurston look pedestrian. From Thurston's perspective, people shouldn't celebrate a world-class trapper capturing Mr. Magoo. That's the epitome of punching down. Refute changed Thurston's DNA for the worst. It made him come face to face with the hurt and pain he had caused. It made him realize that world knows his darkest insecurity: that there's a scared boy trapped in that lanky frame. An enigma loses it's power once the curtain is removed. The Magician's career comes to an abrupt end once the trick is revealed.

More instant coffee gets poured as an ambulance siren blares outside with the modified notes that unnerves every American traveling to London. I have to take my leave, but as I go, Thurston points out that Teen Age Riot has 80+ million plays on Spotify but Harness Your Hopes has 188+ million plays on Spotify. It's an offhanded comment that makes me think maybe Thurston *is* putting me on-- it's so petty I wonder if he's just enjoying acting like Salieri. I imagine him laughing about it later, how he played this role, how he fooled the dumb journalist. Then I realize it's wishful thinking, it's what I want to believe, because the alternative is much too dark for me to deal with.",3,1738354554.0,stephenmalkmus,1,1.0,False

Noticed something I'd never seen before: confident people didn't just walk differently - they existed differently.

They stretched their arms when thinking. Let their legs take up space. Gestured while talking like they owned the air around them.

Caught my own reflection - arms crossed, legs tucked, basically trying to occupy as little space as possible. Like I was apologizing for existing.

Started experimenting. Uncrossed my arms. Let my shoulders drop. Put my elbows on the armrests.

Felt weird. Uncomfortable. Like I was being rude somehow. Then realized: I'd trained myself to stay small, and my body had learned the lesson too well.

Now I notice it everywhere. In meetings. On the train. How much space we take up is how much space we think we deserve.

Still feels strange sometimes. But my body is learning a new language - one that doesn't start with ""sorry.""",139,1738354539.0,bodylanguage,20,0.99,False
1ieo4jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/altadena/comments/1ieo4jj/lead_asbestos_testing_results/,Lead & Asbestos testing results,"Hey everyone

My home was near the Eaton fires in the ALD-CALAVERAS evacuation zone. My block was spared by the fire, but my house had some ash come in through poorly sealed windows and doors.

When my partner and I first went back, we did what you're not supposed to do and tried to clean it up ourselves with a swifter, HEPA vac, and Clorox. Figured since there wasn't too much, we might be able to get the smell out that way, though we also completely sealed off the fireplace and just ignored it in our clean. We've also been running several HEPA air purifiers.

That didn't work for the smell, so we decided to get serious, go through insurance and do a real environmental report. From the report, I not only wanted to know if there were chemicals in areas where ash still existed (e.g. in fireplace, attic, some places we missed by the windows) but how far in to the home it actually got.

I did 14 wipe tests for both Lead and Asbestos, and another 4 air tests for Asbestos with JLM environmental. This covered the entirety of our 1200 sqft home, including inside my closet, and several cabinets. I also covered our office desk which is \~4 ft from a window and door that had significant ingress of particles. The test also covered inside our detached garage and in the attic. Note that for the results of the garage floor, I vacuumed that with a HEPA vac but did not mop. Note as well that the sampled area in the laundry room is directly below a window that had particles, and we did not mop there. I feel very lucky to be able to afford that amount of testing financially, and I hope these results are useful for other folks nearby.

One qualitative thing that the person who conducted the test told me is he hasn't seen tests come back with asbestos yet, and mine also had no asbestos detected. Obviously, this doesn't mean it isn't out there but it was definitely interesting to hear anecdotally for me.

I'm likely going to do a soil test from a raised planter we have where we plant vegetables in a few weeks, though before I do I'll be removing several inches from the soil since I'm assuming anything on top will contain some nasty stuff.

I think haru or cheolsu visited him gave him a warning or ultimatum for his mother's life or su ae's and I think his father was involved with them. And the last time he called I think it might have been to inform that he was going to the hospital to see his mother there I think something might have had happened. His father would have had threatened him and confiscated all his electronics. In exchange for his mother's life and su ae's. And in that period he would have gotten badly I mean badly abused that's why the comment in episode 106 was highlighted that Grey's secret was chilling. And he is acting like a jerk to make su ae lose any love she had for him. And some are saying that haru might have had gotten involved to make it seem like that they both ghosted each other I think it's untrue. Remember in episode 108 when he was wiping the coffee from her skirt he said sorry I should have had told you? Yep. That foreshadows his secrets that what is about to come. And just like su ae's life was shown how she lived in these 10 years(barely shown but shown) I think so after the hiatus the author will release Eunhyeok‚Äôs pov because she is seeing that how much hate he is getting right now. And the more that I think I about it I think the author gave us a little hint that he was about to ghost her. Anyways that's just me.

I've only begun to experiment with it and it works pretty good but it's still rough around the edges. There are 3 lora's, one for portraits, another for local editing and a subject context.

First example I used an image of myself and prompted for wearing a superman shirt drinking coffee, pretty decent, works like a face swapper, similar to Pulid

2nd & 5th image was using the subject lora to put my logo on an object, not perfect but decent. I'm still learning how to use it.

3rd image was just a simple local edit adding sunglasses to superman

4th image using the subject lora and the same superman image to put him on a skateboard. The positioning is weird but...you get the idea.

I'm still wrapping my head around how these Lora's work, check out Sebastian's video and for the workflow for the portrait lora. I'll be making a video once I get more familiar with it.

It's still in early development so it's not perfect but show great potential. It's sort of like having a lora with one image.
