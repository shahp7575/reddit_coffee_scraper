1kqvzbk,https://i.redd.it/ch0kbr1p3v1f1.jpeg,Someone overturned my water dish :(,"Just wanted to get this off my chest in a community where people appreciate pigeons for what they are.  
It's sad that they are so misunderstood. 

I keep two water dishes out for our local pibbens -   
One is a pie dish quite near my apartment building among a bush,   
and the other is a stainless steel thing in our local park, very snugly concealed behind some bushes.

Every time I try to give seeds to our birds in public (not a lot, just about 2-3 handfuls a time) I've been told off, so I make a point to make the rounds early in the morning.  
There's nothing more I enjoy than watching the birds go while having a flask of coffee.

This morning, I found that the pie dish was turned over - there was no wind yesterday, so it must have been someone being deliberate. I tidy up any bird poop and maybe some trash around the area when I refill the water dish, so it was extra hurtful. Why go out of your way to do something so mean? 

It wasn't like they had broken the pie dish or confiscated it, but it hurt nonetheless :(   
I hope this doesn't happen again - if it does, I think I'll relocate it to the park.   
(I like the idea of having multiple locations for water, but it's a bit more out in the open.)

1kqvy3w,https://i.redd.it/j6hdg21n3v1f1.jpeg,The Bell in the Thicket,"As recounted by Eleanor “Nell” Abernathy, newly settled on the old Foster place, Gallberry County, Alabama



I.  ​The Hush

I came to Gallberry for the hush.
After fifteen years shelved between the stacks of the Mobile Public Library and six months dissolving in family-court paperwork, I wanted somewhere the wind still spoke in pine-needled whispers and people minded their own grief in private. Zillow spat up the Foster place—white clapboard sagging beside a soybean field, price slashed to scandal. I wired the money before I let myself wonder why it sat empty.

The county clerk who notarized the deed, Miss Ora Lee Bledsoe, eyed me like I’d bought a burial plot instead of a homestead. “You’ll be needin’ good boots,” she said, stamping her seal. “Brush runs thick back there, and things get… tangled.” The way she chewed that last word sent a chill creeping under my collar despite the October heat.

I did not ask for details. I’d spent months bargaining for peace; I wasn’t about to lose it over local superstition.



II.  ​The Mourner’s Bell

The Foster acreage backs into a thicket where muscadine vines kink like coiled serpents. In the middle of that snarl hangs a bronze bell older than the house—green with verdigris, throat black as a gutted church. Someone long dead must have erected a cedar post and looped rusty chain through its yoke, then let the undergrowth swallow everything but the faint metallic glint.

On my first evening, I stood at the edge of the vines, studying how Spanish moss draped the bell like mourning lace. The air smelled of wet iron, and though the sky was clear, dew slicked my palms. I called to see if any neighbor had claim to it. My voice died in the trees unanswered. I told myself children had once used it to declare suppertime and left it at that.

The bell rang after midnight.
Three slow chimes seeped through my open windows, vibrating the china in the old hutch like a tuning fork struck against bone. I jolted awake, heart rat-racing, but put the sound down to wind fiddling through the vines. When dawn came, I poured chicory coffee, shook off the dream, and settled onto the sun-warped porch steps.

That’s where the mailman collapsed.
Mr. Kelly—pink-cheeked, barrel-bodied—clutched his chest and pitched forward on my top stair while digging for a certified letter. I called 9-1-1, compressed his sternum, counted off beats. He never made it five miles to Dothan Medical.

I attended the funeral out of shaky courtesy. Every pew creaked under eyes that slid from the casket to me as though the two were lashed together. Miss Ora Lee squeezed my hand afterward and asked, “Did you hear the Mourner’s Bell, child?” I shook my head, lying clean as a fresh sheet.

I slept poorly the next six nights—listening, counting heartbeat, hearing only crickets sawing in the soybean rows. The hush finally lulled me until, on the seventh night, the bell tolled again. Two strikes, cold and hollow, each echo flittering through the rafters like bats.

The following afternoon a logging truck jack-knifed on Highway 14—splintered pine trunks pinning the driver and his groundman before diesel fumes could even vanish. Sheriff Sutton said wet leaves made the rig slip; skeptics whispered about curses older than asphalt.

It was coincidence stacked on grief, I told myself—but even a librarian knows how many coincidences make a pattern.

So I began keeping count in an old circulation ledger I’d smuggled from Mobile:

3 chimes – Mr. Kelly (stroke)
2 chimes – 2 loggers (crush)
3 chimes – Barlow family (trailer fire)
1 chime  – Miss Drummond, history teacher (aneurysm at her desk)

The ledger’s margins filled with questions I wouldn’t admit aloud. Does distance matter? Relations? Intent?

All winter the bell slept. Icicles clung to its lip like teeth. In January I convinced myself the rusted chain had finally snapped in the cold; in February I sweated nightmares of it tolling while vines slithered through my bedroom keyhole. March thawed the earth and my unease—until last night.



III.  ​Four Chimes

A thunderless heat storm rolled past at dusk, leaving the air electric. I spread my divorce papers across the kitchen table, hunting one missing financial affidavit. Rain slicked the windows; frogs shrieked from the drainage ditch. At 11:47 p.m. the power blinked, the bulbs flared white, and the bell in the thicket struck four deliberate notes.

Each gong vibrated my teeth.
One—grief-shaped and low.
Two—deeper still, like earth shifting coffins.
Three—so loud the window glass bowed.
Four—died to a whisper that coiled through the hallways, mapping corners of the house I hadn’t yet dared dust.

I sat rigid until the clock read 02:00, waiting for sirens that never howled. The scanner on my phone, tuned to sheriff dispatch, buzzed with nothing but routine farm thefts and a trespasser kicked off the Baptist parsonage lawn. No deaths. No wrecks. No smoke-eaters roaring down Highway 52.

Dawn peeled the sky raw pink, and I watched the soybean leaves quake like an audience shifting before a preacher begins. The world moved on, rude and alive, as though the bell hadn’t rewired the physics of breathing just hours earlier.



IV.  ​The Shadows Stretch

At five-thirty the hummingbirds came to the porch feeder, their wings a deck of cards shuffled by God. I counted them—one, two, three, four—until dread knotted my throat. I fled inside, barricading myself behind the screen door as though birds could break a latch.

By noon, rumor had spread. My driveway grated under tires: Miss Ora Lee’s Pontiac, Pastor Thibodeaux’s truck, then two local men whose names I hadn’t learned but whose eyes matched the sickled hush of the bell. They sipped sweating Mason jars of tea on my porch, not quite meeting my gaze, talking about how the Mourner’s Bell sometimes took its time—how its choice could hang in the air like peaches going soft until the right soul bruised under its own weight.

“That’s old-world clockwork, ma’am,” Pastor murmured. “It rang four because something inside it knew that’s what the earth was owed.”
“Four what?” I hissed, knuckles whitening on the doorframe.
“Debts,” he said simply. “Lives, sins—same ledger.”

They left at sundown, offering prayers I didn’t want. I lit every lamp, brewed chicory thick enough to walk on, and dragged a wicker chair to the threshold where kitchen linoleum met back-porch wood. From there I could see the thicket, a black wall stitched against the night.

The gravel crunch came at 8:12 p.m.—a vehicle turning off the county road. Headlights never followed. Instead, silence thickened. I cracked the door.

Four shapes stood on the drive, silhouettes cut from darkness itself. Each of them held a silence shaped like a person I’d almost known. They did not move, yet their shadows stretched unnaturally long across the yard, crawling toward the treeline.

Floodlamps I’d installed for snakes flicked on, washing the ground a jaundiced yellow. My own shadow spilled before me—one body, one outline. The four figures on the drive cast none at all.

Something cold rippled through my gut, as though an invisible fish had banged the inside of a bucket. I thought of the ledger: four debts.



V.  ​The Thicket’s Mouth

I grabbed the cast-iron poker from the hearth and stepped outside. Damp heat swallowed me. Cicadas ratcheted down to a stop, leaving a vacuum in their place. The figures slid backward without footsteps, retreating toward the muscadine-choked thicket where the bell slept. Every fiber of reason told me to run, yet some gravitational dread reeled me forward.

The shapes formed a crooked line—a procession mirroring the posts that mark old cemetery rows when marble headstones have gone to ruin. They paused at the curtain of vines, then melted inside as though the greenery were water.

Vines parted for me, too. Sweet rot and iron filled my nose. The bell glimmered under a slit of moon, chain groaning like a beast clearing its throat. In the starved light I saw carvings in the cedar post—hatch marks, each set grouped in four. Countless tallies scarred the wood, decades of silent accounting.

My voice tried to rise, but I had none. The bell yawned, tilting on its rust-gnawed hook, and I understood: it hadn’t simply told the deaths; it took them. An auctioneer trading chimes for souls. It had swung four times in the night but collected nothing by morn. The debt hovered. Interest, I sensed, could grow teeth.

Wind hissed through the vines, or maybe the bell itself whispered. My ears filled with a rushing like pages turning too fast to read. Images flooded my skull: the mailman clutching his chest, logs pinning screaming men, a trailer lit like a candle stub—all replayed as though projected on the shutter of my eyelids. And behind each scene I glimpsed my own face, watching.

I stumbled backward, vomiting chicory into the leaves. The chain rattled, the bell lurched, and I ran—crashing through brush until moonlight sprayed over the yard again. The porch felt miles wide. I lurched up the steps, slammed the door, bolted it, and sagged against the frame.

Inside, power flickered. Four knocks rapped the front window—soft, measured. I couldn’t look. I dragged the ledger from the kitchen and, with shaking pen, wrote a new entry beneath the last:

4 chimes – balance unpaid

I do not know if dawn will add four names to the Gazette obituaries or if I am meant to pay the note myself in installments—memory, sanity, heartbeat, breath.

But the vines outside are shifting even now, and somewhere amid their slither I hear bronze clearing its throat for another toll.

If you find this ledger and the ring count no longer matches the tally carved on that cedar post, remember: the bell does not warn. It collects. And the shadow you stand in might belong to someone already counted.

Yeah, you. Caught in 4K.
Anyway — hey there. I’ve got a mildly unhinged sense of humor and a soft spot for the absurd. One of my favorite quotes is:
“A statement becomes infinitely more meaningful if you attach the name of a dead philosopher underneath it.” — Plato
(He didn’t actually say that, but now it feels deep, doesn’t it?)

Let’s skip the small talk. Picture this: we’re on a rooftop at 2AM. The city is asleep, but our thoughts aren’t. Maybe we won’t see each other after tonight, so we can drop the filters and talk like we’ve got nothing to lose.

I’m 26. I’m drawn to old books with cracked spines, quiet coffee shops where no one knows your name, and indie films where nothing really happens but everything still feels important. I overthink things, romanticize strangers, and sometimes get lost in my own head — but I’m always down for a real conversation.

I’m not here to impress. I’m here to connect.
So tell me something true — even if it’s messy. Especially if it’s messy.

This is a safe space. No judgment. No need to be anything other than exactly who you are.

It’s not just insecurity—it’s a deep sense of responsibility. I don’t want to hurt her, even unintentionally.
But the problem is, she’s really my type and if anything we’re a good match fundamentally, I think.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/s/PqeNTwBTEA): **May 8, 2025**

I’m 32 and live in a quiet suburb with my partner and our two cats. We have a small house with a fenced backyard and a guest room, and we actually enjoy having people over from time to time. I work from home as a freelance writer, so I spend a lot of time in my space, and I’m kind of protective of my routine.

My old college friend Kayla recently texted to say she’d be in town for a week and wanted to hang out. I was genuinely excited it’s been years since we’ve seen each other. But then she added that she’d be bringing her dog, Maple, a 90-pound golden retriever, and she hoped it would be cool to stay at my house instead of paying for a hotel or Airbnb. Her message was something like, “You have a yard, it’ll be perfect!”

Here’s where it gets complicated. I like dogs, but my cats absolutely do not. One of them is elderly and on medication, and both have had bad experiences with dogs before. The last time a friend brought a dog over for literally an hour my older cat went into hiding for two days and stopped eating. It was a mess.

On top of that, my partner has a mild dog allergy. It’s not life-threatening, but after a couple hours of exposure, he gets congested, itchy, and generally miserable. Hosting a dog for an entire week inside our home just isn’t something we can comfortably do.

So I explained all this to Kayla as kindly as I could. I told her I’d love to spend time with her, take her out for brunch, maybe go for a walk or have a day together somewhere dog-friendly. I even helped her look up a few pet-friendly Airbnbs nearby and offered to help cover the first night or two if cost was a problem.

She didn’t take it well. She said I was being rigid and dramatic, and that “it’s just a dog.” Then she said she thought I’d be more understanding, and implied that I was choosing my pets over people. Since then, she’s basically ghosted me. A couple of mutual friends think I did the right thing, but others say I could’ve just made it work for a few days and that it’s not that big of a deal.

Now I feel torn. I honestly don’t think I was being unreasonable, but part of me wonders if I should’ve just sucked it up for the sake of the friendship.

So am I the jerk?

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Isn't she choosing her pet over over your partners health and the health and stress of YOUR pets?? She needs to get a grip.

**Commenter 2:** A 90 lb golden retriever? NO NO and more NO. It's one thing for people to expect you to put them up for a week to save money (no matter what the cost and inconvenience to you) but when they assume they can bring along their animals? That's bullshit. Cats or no cats.

**Commenter 3:** NTJ

I'm sorry, how did this go from ""hey, I'm in town for a few days, let's hang out and catch up! "" to ""My dog and I are going to be staying at your house for a week."" She didn't even ask to stay she demanded. Anybody telling you're an asshole for this has just volunteered to house what's-her-face and the dog.

Also, don't offer to help her pay for an Airbnb, that's ridiculous and a waste of money. 

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/s/yPUqA1bCE6): **May 13, 2025 (five days later)**

Update to my last post

After Kayla ghosted me, I figured that was that. I sent her one more message just saying I was still happy to see her if she was up for it, and that I hoped she understood I wasn’t trying to be mean or anything, just realistic. I didn’t hear anything back.

Then, like three days into the week she said she’d be in town, I get a text completely out of the blue:

""I’m outside. Hope the cats can deal with it for one night.""

I literally froze. Before I could even answer, she’s knocking at the door with her suitcase and Maple (her dog). I opened it to talk, and she just walked in. Maple ran straight into the house, barking, and my older cat just bolted upstairs in full panic mode. Total chaos.

I told her kind of frantically, honestly that this wasn’t okay and she needed to take Maple outside so we could talk. She just exploded. Said I was being “ridiculous” and “cold,” that my house isn’t a ""temple for cats"" (her words), and that I clearly “value animals more than people.”

I told her again, as calmly as I could manage, that she needed to leave. That’s when she snapped.

She knocked over this little bookshelf I keep in the living room plants, books, everything flying. Then she grabbed a coffee mug off the side table and smashed it on the floor. For context, it was one of the last things my partner had from his grandma. He was right there, watching it all happen.

We ended up calling the cops. She stormed out before they got there, dragging Maple behind her, and I gave them her name and everything. We filed a police report and I’ve started a small claims case for the damages. Between the broken stuff, an emergency vet trip for my cat (he stopped eating again from stress), and an urgent care visit for my partner's allergies flaring up really badly it was just a lot.

A few friends who originally said I was being “too rigid” have since changed their minds after hearing what went down. Others are still like, “that’s just how Kayla is,” which is honestly insane to me. Like… how is that even remotely okay behavior??

Anyway, I’m done feeling guilty. I tried to be understanding. I set a boundary and even offered alternatives. I was not mean. And she turned around and completely disrespected me, my home, and the people (and animals) I care about.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTJ and might I add please consider adding a screened locked door to talk to people without granting them access to your home? They have one at Menards for 150$ any anyone that is mildly handy can hang it up via YouTube video explanation. Your (hopefully ex) friend is NUTSO

**Commenter 2:** Is she fucking nuts?

**Commenter 3:** Just because that's the way someone IS, doesn't make you her doormat or hotel! She's the complete asshole here.

**Commenter 4:** Nah, I'm glad you got the law involved. It's unacceptable enough to show up with her dog after all of the valid reasoning you gave her against it(though even if you hadn't had this, just not wanting someone else's pet in your home is a valid enough reason), but then to throw a tantrum including property damage? Absolutely wild and unforgivable behavior.

I am currently sitting in my hostel room at IIT Delhi, having spent the last few days doing things I never had the courage to do. I never thought I had this much in me, to come this far. I got placed in a great company at a great position. The location is Hyderabad. Will be leaving Delhi behind for the first time in my life. Even though I lived in my hostel, my home is in Delhi. I always had the option to run to my parents when shit hit the fan, but not anymore. I am moving cities for the first time and it is hitting me today as I have just a few more hours here. I haven’t slept more than 6 hours in past 48 hours because I want to soak in everything this place has to give me. 

IIT Delhi gave me everything, the best and the worst 2 years of my life. Got the worst heartbreak of my life, lost a friend (who happened to be my classmate) to suicide, saw my mom battle health conditions that were severe. Yet here I am, standing on my two feet. Amidst all the chaos, I got the best of people, who became family. People who took me to AIIMS at 2 AM in the night after I had an accident. People who stayed up and made my code work because they couldn’t see me struggling. People who took care of me when fever broke my body. People who became mothers because we made an unsaid pact that we won’t tell our parents if we get sick. People who cooked for me, made me coffee and most importantly made me get out of bed when all I wanted to was curl up and sleep. People who asked me why I didn’t come for lunch, watched out, looked out for me. These weren’t just people, they were the family I got beyond my family. I wish I could get some more time here, to live it all once again. To go to LHC once again, to sleep in CBS lab once again, to play dumb-charades all night long once again, and most importantly, to meet once again like strangers and part as family once again. I would like to do all this all over again. But alas, good things always come to end. Time to make my parents proud ! Time to face life like an adult!

I’ve got what I call SpiderMan-Hulk syndrome some kind of male body dysmorphia where I want to be lean and jacked, all at once. Fun times.

When I’m home, I work with limited space, but I don’t use that as an excuse. My home workouts usually start with a 10-minute stretch focused on kicks so hips, legs, and lower back. Then it’s a quick ab circuit (scissor kicks, flutter kicks, starfish crunches), followed by 3–5 minutes of shadow kickboxing. I’ll do 10 and 15 minute sessions occasionally. I can go 30 with black coffee.

Lately I’ve been syncing up with a few virtual accountability partners. If one of them wants to try one of my routines, I’ll redo it on camera to demo it for them;it’s actually great for gains and accountability. Same goes if they want to challenge me with one of their workouts. I don’t follow any set time for workouts just whenever I can get it in between fieldwork. (I’m an aquatic biologist and lucky to love what I do.)

If you’re into fitness, like mixing up workouts, and want to share routines or maybe even tag-team virtually drop a comment or DM. Always down to connect with other workout-obsessed folks. Anyone else feel the same? What kind of training are you into these days?

(Background: when we first dated he used to talk about another chick he worked with [same job] like he hated her, ended up dating her and hooking up with her the weekend of the week we split Which I just let go because we were split up but it did create a bit of trust issues because I was certain he didn’t have any interest)

In 2023 we would hook up every weekend for a few months, during this time I asked to be in a committed relationship but was rejected. I ended up ghosting him for a while to help with my attachment that had built.

In July 2024 we got back into touch and he immediately asked me to be his partner in a committed relationship admitting he made a mistake turning me down. And we decided to get a place of our own.

After getting back together I learnt he slept with another coworker who had quit right before July 2024 but was rehired at his work recently (maybe 5 months or so) He goes on and on about how much he despises her and regrets ever sleeping with her (which I believed bc she had sent messages at the beginning of our relationship [around June-ish] even though she knew we had gotten back together. (His coworker friends know me from the past) but he ignored her).

Well recently (maybe 3 weeks ago) I found a bra cup in his laundry he says must have been another persons that they left in the dryer (we share a laundry room at our apartments) it was found after I stayed the night out at a friends (my F friend of 10 years just FYI) and a bunch of alc shooters on the coffee table were empty when I returned which was unusual of him he drinks at his desk usually at night when gaming. And then I noticed a notification last week that his coworker had sent a request to follow him on TikTok (his account is private). Today I checked his profile and noticed he accepted her request.

I don’t want to run wild with my imagination or accuse him of anything I want to trust him, I asked him why he accepted the request and he said he doesn’t know how it happened, he didn’t do it.

i’m setting up a cross-cut between her thoughts and actions (not sure if that is the right terminology for it) — I want to show how the illness coexists with her life, and the transition from the thoughts seeming out of place and downright intrusive, to the thoughts slowly bleeding into and coinciding with her actions. So far, i’ve been laying out the thoughts like this:

‘You should really cover your arms and legs.’

and then having the narrative voice in third-person past tense like this:

Anne nursed her coffee cup as though it was keeping her alive. 

They never happen on the same line, I always have a line break between the two. My paragraphs are very short as this is a short story.

is this unbearable to read/ difficult to understand ? i was going to italicise the thoughts for clarity, but i realise that if i do that, i’m compensating for the lack of clarity in my actual *writing*, which is bad practice, or is it? i keep second-guessing myself!

I just dug around in there a bit and it is very warm and moldy, specifically the coffee grounds. I didn’t see any worms. 

I have a few concerns: 
1. Are my worms dead? Or is it possible they burrowed into other parts of the bed and they will come back out when it stops being so rainy? 
2. I’ve searched and found that mold in compost is generally fine and even welcome. In the specific case of an in ground bed where I’m growing vegetables, is it safe? 
3. Is there anything they love (lol) that I can put in to make them happy/make sure they’re still alive? 

I feel like I just need to be more patient. I’m trying to tell myself it is nature and it’ll figure itself out. But I don’t want to mess up my entire vegetable bed, plus it’s on patio pavers so it’s not like it’s exactly the same where the worms could go deep in the ground.

Here, we present 15 innovative small living room decor ideas that will maximize space and infuse personality into your home.

I’ve been doing DoorDash for almost 5 years now, over 5000 deliveries. Most of that time, I’ve lived in the Las Vegas area and primarily worked in the Green Valley zone. Largely due to the face that the hour rate in earn by time is almost $16 an hour. (Not including tips) It’s also a much nicer part of town. 

My question is, is the Green Valley zone a good choice? Or should I consider another zone for better consistency maybe? I’m pretty content with how much I’ve been able to make in my zone but sometimes it takes me clear across town for a single iced coffee or some sh*t like that. Just trying to maximize my earnings in the lead up to me finding another job. I wanna have one last really good couple month run before I find something else.

hey everyone, long time lurker first time poster here. I had something happen this morning while I was getting ready for work and I'm just curious if anyone else has had something similar happen? 

I was in my morning routine - listening to an audiobook, drinking coffee and setting up to do my makeup. I had already washed and prepped my face, so I was ready to get started. As soon as I looked in the mirror, my heart stopped for a second. I saw myself looking back at me, however, I was OLD!!! I'm currently in my 30s but in that moment I'd say I looked to be ~60ish years old!  My eyelids were more hooded/droopy and I had wrinkles on my forehead and around my mouth/eyes. I blinked and nothing changed. I still looked old AF. I stared at myself in disbelief for at least 10 seconds. It wasn't until I turned away from the mirror and looked back into it that my face was finally my 30 yr old face! It was soo strange!! One reason being I had just washed my face and did my skincare in the mirror in my bathroom, my face looked completely normal then. Another reason is it lasted long enough for me to really look at/examine myself so I don't think my eyes were playing tricks on me. What in the actual fuck happened??! Glitch in the matrix or what?

1kqv3up,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1kqv3up/second_date_advice/,Second date advice,"I (20M) matched with a girl (22F) on hinge last week, and we went on our first date Sunday. If you want to know everything I have a post from yesterday up, in short we went for coffee and a walk, decided we wanted to keep things going so we drove around for another hour before I dropped her off home. The date ended with us hugging and making out briefly when she invited me in her apartment to meet her dog. Overall I’d say the date was a success, there was definitely some anxiety and first date awkwardness between us but we have alot in common and we both expressed interest in a second date immediately after. 

We’ve been texting pretty frequently since, I messaged her asking about her availability on Friday but I think she’s asleep and will most likely see it in the morning.

 I want to figure out a good plan for the date, some ideas that come to mind are dinner, arcade/bowling, mini golf, and just driving around. Chances are I’ll be picking her up so my top candidate right now is dinner or some kind of snack + some other activity afterwards, but any suggestions would be appreciated!

Another big thing is that I haven’t really dated seriously since high school, obviously standards and expectations were a lot different and this was the first time I did any sort of physical contact on the first date. Things have definitely started off strong between us physically, and I’m wondering how I should bring that momentum into the next date. Should I try and be more physically affectionate  right away or should I build back up to where we left off? On another note, should I try and be a bit flirty/bold on the days leading up to the date, or would it come across as too much too soon? Honestly I’ve been daydreaming about the kiss we had at the end, I don’t know if it would be weird to try and hit at more making out and kissing and tell her how I feel. 

Lastly, I really want to advance our conversations, on the last date it was mostly small talk but I felt we started to open up a bit more to each other. If the date goes well I sort of want to ask what she’s looking for in a relationship assuming it’s not too soon to do so. Any suggestions on how to deepen the conversation would be great!

For now I’m pretty much just going to pray she’s still interested, but I’d really like to have something lined up as it seems she’d prefer if I took the initiative to plan things out. Thanks!",1,1747711415.0,dating,1,0.67,False

We became official on January of this year, things happened so fast since we clicked the moment we matched. In hindsight, I should have considered it a red flag. We were in a Long Distance Relationship

Things started to unravel February when a burner account messaged her on facebook. The dummy account asked if we were a couple and for how long? Afterwhich she blocked me on all of her socials. I was taken aback by this and i was caught so off guard that i panicked and almost tried to jump off the balcony of my condo. Though she apologized profusely thereafter and i thought it was just an isolated incident. The second one occured last month when we argued as to how we would divide the household expenses once we get married, she was adamant that it should be 60/40 me bearing the 60, it turned into somewhat of a heated argument and i thought it was just that, something all couples go through. It was to my shock when she said she was contemplating if we would work and hinted breaking up with me. I tried so hard to make it up to her and we eventually made amends the night after.

The third most, the one which made me totally consider if I want to be with her anymore when she broke up with me a the third time. For context we had an agreement that we would inform each other where we are since we are LDR. I know now that arrangement would have been to toxic for her since she was preparing for the bar exam while working a full time job. Going back to the story, she failed to inform me that she was already in the coffee shop, i just came to know she was there when i called her, she was already there for 2 hours. I got disappointed and i didnt really put an effort to hide it, she got mad and called me toxic and inconsiderate. Thinking it was just a petty fight, i decided to keep my mouth shut and call her during the night During that call she broke up with me, that was when i blew up, thinking how she could break up again with me over such a small thing, I insulted her and called her names, in particular I called her feeble minded and emotionally immature. I was not proud of what i said and if given a chance to relive that moment again I would have just kept my mouth

I'm a wedding planner myself, I just need someone I can trust to pull off the timing. She is a wedding planner in NYC for high end clients so I know just how skilled she is first hand. She was thrilled to work with me. For about 8 months, we met for coffee and chatted every so often to catch her up on my plans. It felt like an absolutdly perfect fit. 

Fast forward to my engagement party. My MOH hosted the party and my bridesmaids put it all together. It was a beautiful masterpiece and could not have been ANY better. It was magical. Until about 1 hour before the end. All of a sudden my friend Elle is in tears. She informs me that she remembered that today was the anniversary of a really traumatic event in her life and she was having a panic attack. I was so concerned for her and I wanted her to have her privacy and know that I was there for her. I sat with her after my MOH consoled her and we hugged and cried together as I talked her thru it. She said she wanted to rejoin the group but ultimately ended up leaving after going to the bathroom without saying anything to anyone. We sent her some texts but knew she would need some time and space before she replied. 

The next morning, I wake up to a voicemail from Elle saying that she'll no longer be my coordinator because she felt unsupported and betrayed while she was going through a crisis. She felt the party shouldn't have continued and we should have focused on cheering her up as a group. She also felt unthanked for planning my party. I was pretty shocked. Not only by her accusations, but... My BRIDESMAIDS planned my party and my MOH was the host... Am I missing something here? I apologized to her and told her I really thought I had tried my best to comfort her and help but that really was not good enough to her and sounded like excuses. I cant stop thinking about how I just feel like I have whiplash about this whole thing. It was supposed to be, and was at first, one of our happiest days leading up to our wedding, but the hours and days following it have just felt like a dark cloud. Now we are 6 months aeay from the wedding with a lot of loose ends and a bruised heart Am I OverReacting?

TLDR; My friend and wedding coordinator had a panic attack at my engagement party and was upset that the party didnt stop and that we didn't comfort her the way she wanted/needed. She wont be my coordinator anymore now. ",2,1747711311.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I’ve been with my nail tech for two years and have always paid my deposit on time brought coffee if I could never had to reschedule cancel let alone not show up to my appointment. Over this time we did build a friendship and from this experience I feel like I learned to keep providers as business only.
Over the last few months, there have been some instances that made this friendship field transaction. For context, she is only 22 and I am 27. She would often reach out with whatever personal problem she had and as a friend I would often offer solutions, Google search for her and provide more than necessary detail. To then always see her take none of the advice make her own decision then come back with even more problems for me to support with answers. I was recently in the hospital for a week and when she reached out to offer any support or come visit, I did ask that she help remove one of my nails due to being damaged while in the hospital, causing the nail bed to lift. She said I should just clip it myself, which I understand isn’t answer but to offer somebody who is in the hospital support and then decline the support. They’re asking rubbed me the wrong way. This past weekend I was supposed to have an appointment at 2:30 PM. Throughout the whole morning and even leading up to this appointment, I got the sense that I was inconveniencing her. I attempted to set a boundary and even offered to revisit her message with a thoughtful response but then she sent over her “professional “text which included a price of $120 before my $25 deposit. I was able to go to another technician who did the removal manicure and short clear gel for $60. Am I overreacting with the response I said on the day of the appointment? At this point, I am not sure if I even want to salvage this friendship as it feels clear that it’s more about the money.

“Mira’s Cosmic Buffet” — Episode 1: A Message from Beyond

A little girl named Mira lay on a hillside, with grass tickling her elbows and stars sparkling in her eyes. She stared up at the sky with a look that was half curiosity, half hunger. In her imagination, each star had a flavor: some were sweet like cotton candy, others salty like nebula chips, and a few reddish ones? Definitely spicy like Martian hot sauce.

One ordinary night, as she wondered whether stars had sound... texture... or flavor,
the universe “known for having a slightly overactive sense of humor” decided to answer.

A meteor blazed into the atmosphere, roaring like a cosmic oven set to max. A swirling whirlwind of fire, light, and a promise of taste.

Mira watched, eyes wide like saucers, mouth open as if she already had a fork in hand.

> “Waaou! A falling star!! Is it cosmic strawberry? Or maybe... galactic walnut?”



But the meteor, cruel as it was, zoomed right past her. It didn’t explode, didn’t sizzle, didn’t serve itself up. It simply left a shimmering trail and a disappointed little girl with an empty stomach.

Unfazed, she rushed to tell her parents — who were far too busy doing taxes or ironing invisible socks — and didn’t really notice.

But her dad, Loren, who had been only half paying attention while making himself a very fancy cup of coffee, suddenly perked up.

> “A falling star? ...Well now, that does sound like something a dad should be chasing.”



He leapt out the window and chased the glowing trail hanging above him. He climbed the mountain just outside their house like someone running to catch freshly baked bread.

And there it was: the meteor, still warm, gently smoking... and cracked open?

Inside, a glowing white sphere, pulsing like a heart or...

A surprise egg?

The sphere wobbled. It stretched. And from the gentle steam rising, almost like whipped stardust, it began to take form...

A being? A dessert with legs? A friend?
...Or maybe all of the above?

Find out in the next episode of Mira’s Cosmic Buffet!

1kquw8v,https://i.redd.it/ejpwl0o2tu1f1.jpeg,Perry Farrell gets the ball rolling in an entertaining new book on Lollapalooza,"https://popculturelunchbox.substack.com/p/perry-farrell-gets-the-ball-rolling

After sitting through Paramount+’s somewhat unenlightening recent three-part documentary on the now-mythic Lollapalooza music festival’s history, I thought maybe a newly released book on the topic—Lollapalooza: The Uncensored Story of Alernative Rock’s Wildest Festival by Richard Bienstock and Tom Beaujour—could do it more justice.

Really, for me, it’s not so much light to shed but whether it would spur some memories of the event that I’ve followed since its 1991 inception and also attended once, back on July 17, 1994 at Riverport Ampitheater in St. Louis. That’s a long time ago and it’s tough to remember as many details as I would like. It would be great if these authors could help with that.

And right from the start, from the amazing list of speakers set to be featured in this oral history, it appears to be an excellent document that begins by proclaiming the festival’s wider cultural relevance:

“The then-new Rock the Vote organization registered 25,000 new voters on the first Lollapalooza tour, fueling a wave that would be credited with helping to put Bill Clinton in the White House. Lollapalooza was a traveling ‘Woodstock for the Lost Generation,’ a New York Times headline screamed. It set the template for the modern American music festival and paved the way for touring concerns like Warped, Lilith Fair, Ozzfest, and, later, Bonnaroo, Coachella, and the scores of other contemporary destination fests that are now an integral part of how audiences experience live music.”

I’m glad the book hones in on the festival’s initial and iconic run from 1991 to 1997. That was part of the problem with the documentary, which spent way too much time on the far less culturally earthshaking period when Lollapalooza returned from 2003 onward.

Perry Farrell is of course the central Lollapalooza character, as the founding creator, but several players are surprised that such an out-there alien-like person would be the one to take the helm in such a savvy, business-smart way. (I should note that the interviews with Farrell are among the main redeeming qualities of the documentary. He could just stare at the camera or read the phone book and it would be interesting.)

The seed of Farrell’s idea was planted at a place called the Desolation Center, where a bunch of weirdos would hang out and take LSD. The owner of the place recounts that “in ‘83 we started doing shows in the Mojave Desert, busing people out to what was basically a dry lake bed. Perry was at all of ’em. And he played at the last one, which we called the Gila Monster Jamboree, in January of ’85. It was [Farrell’s band] Psi Com, the Meat Puppets, Sonic Youth, who were doing their first-ever L.A. show, and Redd Kross.”

Back home in Los Angeles, as hair metal was turning into a new rock scene, Guns N’ Roses and Farrell’s new band Jane’s Addiction were creating a “city-wide vibe.” Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine was one of Farrell’s earliest followers. He said:

“There’d be flyers in coffee shops and record stores and head shops for some event that Jane’s Addiction was putting on, but it wasn’t a gig at the Roxy, it was in downtown L.A. … in a train yard … with an S&M performance. Or it was thirty miles south of Big Bear, and they’re gonna have a bohemian butterfly picnic … and Jane’s Addiction’s gonna play! This was a band that was much more than just music—they had ideas about how life should be lived.”

Farrell was very specific that he wanted Jane’s to end and to go out on a big note. Lollapalooza was going to be that note. Of course the band has gotten back together on and off over the years, with perhaps the final chapter happening this year when Farrell got in a fight onstage with guitarist Dave Navarro.

The idea for Lollapalooza came even more into focus when the band witnessed the electricity of so-called alternative bands at the Reading Festival in England. Farrell thought a blow-out farewell tour of seven bands would do the trick, so each member of Jane’s plus some of its crew each picked a band they wanted on the first Lollapalooza. One of the choices was Pixies, who stupidly declined and were replaced by Living Colour. It’s tough to say whether Pixies would have worked well in that lineup. They could play to 85,000 people in the UK, but were still a club act in the U.S., where there was a mindset to still be “promoting Winger videos.”

One of the other inventive elements Farrell incorporated was to try to have a wide spectrum of political views represented at the booths that would be scattered outside the concert areas. The problem was almost all the conservative groups refused to be a part of it. So what existed in the end was mostly art, tattoo piercings, tie dyes, and creative unique drinks. Bob Guccione Jr. of Spin Magazine and Gibby Haynes of Butthole Surfers both say in the book that they wish Lollapalooza had been their idea.

My memories of that day in St. Louis nearly 31 years ago include:

I was really excited to be at a festival not far from my home and featuring a bunch of bands that called out my name. I had been to Monsters of Rock with Van Halen, Scorpions, Metallica, and others, but Lollapalooza was much more made for my style.

The tickets were probably more than I had ever paid for a concert at that point and had gone up from $27.50 in 1991 to $28.50 by 1994. Still, that total only ticked up about another $2 for service charges, back in the days before Ticketmaster’s grand scam began.

Guided by Voices had only joined the festival the day before, so we were really lucky to get to see them along with 100 or so other people on the side stage in the early afternoon. Flaming Lips also played that stage and those two shows alone were worth the price of admission. I rememeber “She Don’t Use Jelly” really got the crowd hopping.

The other side stage bands were The Verve, Luscious Jackson, and Palace Songs.

Sets on the main stage by Beastie Boys, George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, The Breeders, and a A Tribe Called Quest were all top-notch parties. I was perhaps looking most forward to Smashing Pumpkins, and they were fabulous most of the time until Billy Corgan began screaming and throwing a tantrum at the crowd for some reason, which ended the long day on a bit of a bummer.

The rest of the main stage was just alright: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, L7, and Boredoms (although those last two had the wildest mosh pits, which I luckily viewed from our spot higher up on the lawn).

I’m looking forward to continuing with the oral history of Lollapalooza soon.",1,1747710705.0,90sRock,0,1.0,False

I was in my morning routine - listening to an audiobook, drinking coffee and setting up to do my makeup. I had already washed and prepped my face, so I was ready to get started. As soon as I looked in the mirror, my heart stopped for a second. I saw myself looking back at me, however, I was OLD!!! I'm currently in my 30s but in that moment I'd say I looked to be ~60ish years old!  My eyelids were more hooded/droopy and I had wrinkles on my forehead and around my mouth/eyes. I blinked and nothing changed. I still looked old AF. I stared at myself in disbelief for at least 10 seconds. It wasn't until I turned away from the mirror and looked back into it that my face was finally my 30 yr old face! It was soo strange!! One reason being I had just washed my face and did my skincare in the mirror in my bathroom, my face looked completely normal then. Another reason is it lasted long enough for me to really look at/examine myself so I don't think my eyes were playing tricks on me. What in the actual fuck happened??! Glitch in the matrix or what?

I've been on one date at 24, we had fun and I ended up having sex for the first time, but we never saw each other again.

Like many men, I have friends, social life and hobbies. I'm an okay looking guy and sometimes notice women looking at me, but it's quite rare.

Even when women do look my way, I'm unsure if it's because they find me creepy or not. I know I'm not, but the anxious thoughts drive me crazy.

To be completely honest, I subconsciously checked out of the dating game in my early 20's, but never truly realized until last year.

In a more practical sense, the reason I've never dated is because I don't talk to many women, never asked for a date, can't flirt for shit and have terrible confidence/self esteem that clearly shows when talking to women.

Hell, I often struggle to enjoy sitting in a coffee shop due to the women who work there. I've tried facing this fear many times, but it gets worse every time. Last week, I had to use the bathroom/toilet a few times in an attempt to calm my nerves. 

According to social media, a guy has to be super handsome and successful at minimum. I logically know this isn't true as I have plenty of friends in long term relationships.

I read information on the internet on ""How to know when a women likes you"" and I can't resonate with those lists at all. 

It's crazy how we live in a world where some men need to ignore women, while others don't have that luxury lol.

Overall, I'm very confused where to begin, my mindset regarding dating, sex and relationships are beyond fucked. I'm starting to lose hope that I'll figure it out.

Sets on the main stage by Beastie Boys, George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, The Breeders, and a A Tribe Called Quest were all top-notch parties. I was perhaps looking most forward to Smashing Pumpkins, and they were fabulous most of the time until Billy Corgan began screaming and throwing a tantrum at the crowd for some reason, which ended the long day on a bit of a bummer.

The rest of the main stage was just alright: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, L7, and Boredoms (although those last two had the wildest mosh pits, which I luckily viewed from our spot higher up on the lawn).

I’m looking forward to continuing with the oral history of Lollapalooza soon.",0,1747710604.0,Lollapalooza,0,0.5,False

I’m not a coffee drinker, don’t have much experience of different types and have quite sensitive taste. Any amount of coffee in a drink has ended with me not being able to drink it, I just hate the taste of coffee lol (plus I’m on adhd meds so it’s not good for my heart if I have caffeine)

I’m not a big fan of hot chocolate but white hot chocolate, hot vanilla milk drinks and the chai latte from McDonald’s has me in a chokehold so anything similar to that would be perfect!

But ironically, along with those joys, loneliness grows.

Going out for lunch on the weekend always fills me with excitement.  
I sit at the restaurant, eager for delicious food. Even if the dish doesn’t quite match the photo on the menu, it doesn’t matter. In the monotony of daily life, even such small changes feel like a welcome break.

But, on the way back, after laughing and eating, there is always a quietness.  
Just a few hours ago, I was filled with energy, but now, sitting in the car, staring out the window in silence, I often ask myself:

*Where does this emptiness come from?*

Perhaps it’s because I know all too well that joy is fleeting.  
The good things are always brief. And that’s why loneliness feels deeper.

Still, I try not to miss those brief moments of joy.  
They help me endure the day, and they give me a reason to hold on in this place.

Especially when someone, in earnest admiration, presents me with two bags of 짱구(Jiang-Goo) brought from Korea.

I wanted to ask if anyone knew of a nice coffee scent with a sort of light airy and creamy quality? I own a few indie coffee scents that are nice but are more of a syrupy extra sweet type scent rather than milky and foamy. By the way anyone looking for a realistic black coffee with caramel syrup, please check out Sorces 2 a.m in Lafayette. Another realllly good coffee scent but with chocolate, rather than caramel is Drop Down Dews Coffee House, I would say this one smells like black coffee with chocolate syrup.Both are lovely and syrupy sweet coffee scents.

we got a new guy recently i’ll call him jake. he’s in his early 30s, been married for a few years, no kids. whenever we invite him to join us for lunch or whatever, he always says he can’t. at first we thought he was just shy or maybe not into group stuff, which is totally fine.

but then one day during a meeting, our boss brought coffee and donuts, and jake was like “man i want one so bad,” and someone asked if he had a health thing. he goes, “nah, my wife allison doesn’t let me have coffee or junk food cause she doesn’t like me have any caffeine or sugar” the room went quiet real fast.

i probably shouldn’t have said anything, but i asked, “wait, is that why you never come to lunch with us? cause your wife won’t let you?” and he said yeah. apparently she doesn’t want him doing any social stuff without her now that they’re married. like, he’s only “allowed” to go out if she’s there too.

i told him if anyone tried to control what i eat or who i hang out with, i’d be out. that’s not normal. my boss agreed and told him he might want to talk to someone about it like a counselor or something.

well, jake came in today and said they had a huge fight after that convo and she kicked him out. now he’s talking to a lawyer about separation.

my sister thinks i was out of line bringing that up in front of everyone, but honestly… was i? i didn’t mean to stir the pot, i just couldn’t stay quiet about how messed up that sounded. still, i feel a little guilty. did i overstep?",78,1747710449.0,AITH,22,0.99,False
1kqurb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ResourceAmazing5438/comments/1kqurb2/a_place_in_heaven/,A Place In Heaven,"As Dakota’ was Lying there in her Bed! Thinking to herself “ Do I really want to do this?” Just as the days first light began making its way through the bedroom window looking at me. Saying to me! “ You know that you can do this!” Telling me that a new day was here! Upon me! Promising me that today was going to be different! Saying to myself “ Sure! Like I’ve heard that one before! Tell me something that I haven’t already heard before!” Lying there in her bed Dakota’ knew that this day was just not going to be easy. 

As she then placed her pillow over head saying “ Look! Just let me stay in bed today! Just don’t do this to me! Not today!” But as the mornings sunlight was trying to tell me in its way, that there was a place still in this life for me. As Dakota’ then set up in her bed! Setting there looking out of the window to yet an another day! Another day of “I can’t do this! I just can’t! Not today! Just go away!” Setting there asking herself! 

“What has life got to give me today? Is there even a place here in this life for me? Omg! I’m just not ready for today!”

With her not knowing then, that later on she would realize that there is a place in this life for her. But at the same time leaving her asking the question? “why isn’t there a place in life for everyone! Then! Would you or someone please tell me that!”

Thinking to herself as she looked out of her window just as the sun’s light glimmered through. Glimmering its light through and around the branches of the tree that stood just outside of her window. Watching as the wind would blow through its leaves just as the sun was trying to tell me yet again! Trying to tell me that today was going to be different. With Dakota’ now saying “Okay! You win! I’m getting up! But that doesn’t mean that I have to like it”

Making her way out of bed saying to herself! “Man! I’m feeling like the world’s oldest 30 something year old woman!” But just as that thought left me the quietness of the morning was being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids.  Walking by my window making their way to a nearby school! With Dakota’ then saying! “Oh come on! Can’t you kids be any louder! Omg! I’m now starting to sound like my mother!” 

With Dakota’ standing there looking out seeing and hearing the kids as they walked by. Knowing that the sounds was just not going away anytime soon! Slowly! But surely making her way to the bathroom standing there in front of the mirror looking. As Dakota’ the said “Jesus! I’m just not ready for today! Jesus! If you are up there listening! I’m going to all the help that I can get today! If you are listening! Listening to a 30 something year old girl! Stand here and complain! Yeah! like my everyday complaining!” 

Standing there running her hand back through her usual messed up blonde hair. Standing there looking into the mirror, looking at a blonde haired blue eyed girl! thinking to herself “Oh yeah! I am sure ready for today!” As Dakota’ stood there messing up her hair even more! Saying to herself! “ Yeah! This girl is certainly going places! Just not today! I mean! What more could a blue eyed girl do to get through yet another day.”

As Dakota’ just stood there screaming into the mirror! Pulling her hair in every direction! Except where she wanted it to go! Saying to herself! 

 “Oh yeah! Another day of let’s see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself!” standing there in the bathroom now trying to put her clothes on! With her now screaming! Saying! “Oh my God! One pants leg at a time! Jesus! I swear! I’m thinking that! I’m really thinking about just stripping everything off and just!” Screaming as she finally finished putting her clothes on asking herself yet again!

“ Do I really want to do this?Do I really want this day to even be here” 

With Dakota’ now making her way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Saying to herself! “ Oh yeah! Just what Dakota’ needed this morning! My cup of hot Joe!” With her not really knowing where to start! Or he’ll! even to begin! But first things first! Her Coffee! For she just wasn’t doing nothing or? until she has had her first mornings coffee. With Dakota’ now settling down at the kitchen table looking at the mornings newspaper along with her coffee. 

Saying to herself! “Well! Let’s see what is happening in the world today! Who is here! And who is not!” Setting there as she flipped through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what else the world may have to look forward to. Throwing the newspaper to the side thinking to herself saying 

“ Nothing! Nothing else is happening I guess! I mean is there anything left in this Life!” Thinking to herself was there any faith left in her at all! 

Knowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing her things before heading out the door. She then noticed that her coat was still hanging in the closet. Saying to herself in the process! “I swear if my head wasn’t attached to me!” dropping her purse back onto the kitchen table. Saying to herself! 

“My head would still in the bed asleep it if we’re not attached to me” 

Doing a complete 180 making her way back into her room opening up her closet door reaching for it screaming 

“Oh my God! Now where in the hell is it!”

And that was when she then noticed a box setting there in the corner, from just out of shear curiosity she then reached it grabbing it. Now trying to get her own self from out of the closet saying to herself in the process. “ Omg! Jesus! I swear this closet is going to be the end of me yet!”

Walking back into the kitchen holding the while dragging her coat along with her placing both of them down onto the kitchen table. Not knowing of what she would even find in it as she set down ready to open this bad boy up! And with both look of what is it! And then! Memories! Memories that would bring her to rediscovering the past in her life. A past that would bring her to finding something that was missing from her life. 

 Dakota’ just didn’t realize it at the moment! That It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter. With one of the photos being of her mom setting there looking to the photo of her mom. With Dakota’ knowing that she was not always very close to her mom! But  it would still bring a tear her eyes! 

But It didn’t seem to make her day any better at the moment! Knowing that for today marked ten years since her mom had passed away. And with her going to visit her grave today it just didn’t make it easier. Seeing that photo of her mom! As Dakota’ then picked up another photo! the memories of yesterday hit her even harder! As she looked closely at the photo. Looking at a younger her! A young Girl of around 12 years of age! with her short blonde hair standing there next to her mother.

 Who was next to identical to her! Looking at the photo setting there beside her was her dog, a dog who was named Buddy. Thinking back she remembered the good times that they had with her dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don’t realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.

And that was when Dakota’ found the letter, a letter that she had not seen before today. Setting there thinking to herself that reading it would not make her day any easier. But read it she did! for the letter read as this, 

“. To my lovely Daughter Dakota’ I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize that the hard times and the good times that we had shared together.”

“For no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl! my little Dakota! knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself”

“That no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life. 

Leaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found that day! think back! Back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer on what you found, on what Life had brought to you that summer! just before your teenage Life was just about to begin. 

For when you find it again! You just know that as your mother! A place I have found! A place that i hope you will find too. Knowing that the people you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.”

Reading that then sent Dakota’s mind racing! Racing back to that day! thinking on everything that the day would bring back to her! But little did Dakota’ know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that she would have never knew! For someone it would bring her to that day.

As Dakota’ set there remembering back! Remembering It was early that morning when she had got up. not wanting to get out bed! Sounds familiar! just as her dog buddy would then come running! Jumping up onto Dakota’s bed licking her face making himself known in his way! Of telling Dakota’ that was his way! Only the way that her little buddy could do! Letting her know that another day was here! Another day of exploring together. to find themselves wondering out! And into a world that only their imagination could take them!

Giving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as Dakota’ got out of bed walking into the kitchen as her mom was making breakfast. Saying to her

“Now what would my little Dakota’ like this morning!” As Dakota’s mom then looked to buddy saying! “Oh and what would a good little boy like yourself like!” Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying 

“ maybe later I’m not hungry right now” 

for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before. But before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying 

“Honey I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!” 

jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying 

“ look mom not now I just want to just go! So look I will be back later” 

Making my way out the door as looking back at my mom saying 

“ look I will be back later till then just chilling okay!” 

Walking out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret! Regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.

 But now a journey awaited me! A journey that would in time change my Life forever, forever in a way that I was soon to find out. Setting there on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself

 “what else is out there? What else is out there for us buddy!” I mean What else was there for me in this life.” Looking down to buddy saying to him 

“ let’s go and find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here” 

With that I stood up saying to buddy

 “ let’s go! Let’s do this! Let’s see for ourselves what else is out there” 

walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line thinking to myself “once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us!” Jumping the fence me and buddy then made our way to the road with my house now out of sight. I knew now! That from this point on! That we were on our own! On our way! And with that we were on our way! Aldo on our own! “Okay! So I already mentioned that we were on our own now! But To where? I did not know! But we sure were going to find out when got there! 

As we walked down the dirt road a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road. Seeing a red farm truck parked there! Parked on the side other side of the gas station kinda away from everyone! quickly grabbing buddy running up to the truck climbing onto the tailgate. 

As me and buddy lay there! Down inside the back of the pickup! Making sure that know one saw us! Thinking! “Yeah! me and buddy where on our way! On our way to where? Well we were about to find out!” As we lay there in the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner. Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over quickly covering myself and buddy up. As we both lay there! Trying my best making sure that buddy wasn’t going to be buddy! And start barking! 

Letting half of the world know that we were there! For it wasn’t long till I then heard the owner getting back into the truck! Quickly making sure that no one noticed us. With him now Pulling out of the gas station as I then looked to buddy saying

“Woohoo we are on our way now!”

Feeling the wind as it hit up against the blanket laying there as we made our way down the road. It wasn’t until about fifteen minutes later! uncovering myself and buddy! Making sure that buddy wasn’t going to be quiet! setting up looking out into the empty fields as we passed by them. Feeling the freedom of the wind making our way down the road. At the same time making sure that the driver didn’t see us.  

For our little adventure would have ended very quickly! Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing! Saying to him with a smile 

“ Look! I know what you would say if you could talk! But  I know what I am doing! Really!”

looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road. I thought to myself

“what were we going to do when we got there? Where were we going to go?” 

About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us! With the driver now pulling into the parking lot of the grocery store. Quickly lying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Lying there waiting! Once again making sure that buddy was not going to be buddy! “Now remember no barking!” 

With me now hearing the truck door open as the driver then got out. Upon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear. Double checking! Looking all around before uncovering myself and buddy! Quickly double checking with buddy! “You think it’s clear now! You sure it’s clear!” As buddy then just bark at me! 

With me looking to him saying to him “Hey I know what I’m doing! Okay! Got it! Good! Now let’s go!” making our way from the truck not looking back until we were far enough away. Looking out across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.

 As we then walked from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk. As people would pass us by! Not paying any real attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves until we then came across a gentleman. He was just setting there on a bench in front of a the convenient store whittling away on a piece of wood. Just as he then Look up at me saying 

“Well hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you” 

Saying back to him 

“Thank you! His name is buddy! my mom got him from the pound” 

Smiling back to me! He then asked me saying 

“So where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask”

Replying back to him I said to him 

“Just seeing what a girl and her dog could find on our way! On our little adventure finding out what life has for us”

Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us 

“ finding yourself on an adventure! Why aren’t you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you”? 

“Maybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for! And then when are old enough you can go all of the adventures you like!”

“Then maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.” 

As he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying with him. A drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying 

“ Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way! “

“But just know this little one! The memories that you make as a child! Are the memories that will keep you going! When this little thing that we adults like to call life! When Life just steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep.“ 

thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy then made our way down the street I didn’t know then what he said as I would later in my Life what he meant.

As the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We then came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on us we decided to make camp there for the night Just. Having no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me. 

Thinking to myself! Thinking about my mom! Was she missing me? What was she doing? As I lay there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As lay there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me. 

Soon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would then fall to sleep. For that night finding myself dreaming! Dreaming of myself and buddy! With the two of us being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. 

“ You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there! Someone has a plan for you in this Life”.

 “For everyone that you meet in this Life! Will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or in your memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life” 

As I then Dreamed! I then Dreamed of mom. And In my dream she was crying, crying for me to come home! saying to me 

“ please Dakota’ just come home wherever you are, please just come back to me” 

With me and buddy waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.

With me and buddy now making our way across the field thinking about the journey ahead! The journey would take us to where we were going. Only problem was! That we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way! With me looking down to buddy asking him! “Tell me buddy! Where are we going!” 

Just as buddy just barked at me! With us now spending most of the day keeping in the field. Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road. Looking around I could see an individual standing there in a field across the road in another field. He was just standing there not really knowing on why he was just standing there at the moment. But soon I was going to find out! 

Thinking to myself we could just sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up to the truck climbing over the tailgate before the individual saw us. It wasn’t maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. 

Lying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we were going. Lying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as lay there watching the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. 

I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in this Life. A place that I knew I belonged there! But till then as I lay there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by looking to buddy saying 

“We are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in this Life.”

As the day went by further down the road finding ourselves lying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky just coming into view. Just as we made our way down the highway thirsty and hungry I felt lying there in the bed of pickup. For I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as we passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.

 I found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world. A world that I was not for sure off! A world that just seemed distant! A world that in time! I would come to know that this was my life! As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her.

“Wait mom! Please come back! Please where are you going “ 

Turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying 

“ I love you Dakota! I love you wherever your are” 

With that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself 

“What have I done? What have I done to my mom?”

Just as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Lying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up. 

But before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me 

“What in Gods name! I can’t even believe to what I am seeing!”

Looking at me with a very stunned with a  surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying

 “You have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there” 

Climbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my buddy’s journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said to him

“yes very much so”

 After me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would soon arrive. But then as I heard a voice! A voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me lying there in bed looking at him  saying 

“Hello“

Looking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me 

“Who are you” 

I replied to him saying 

“ I am Dakota and what is your name” 

As he then spoke bake to me saying 

“My name is Billy” 

Walking closer o him I could see that he was sick as he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next to him. Standing there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying 

“The Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer! And that it may take awhile for me to get better” 

But Just then as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy. As I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile 

“ its okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?” With buddy barking to him licking his face! 

Replying to him saying! yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me 

“A journey! 

“Man! I would love very much to go on a journey someday! A journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed” 

Looking to Billy I said to him 

“Maybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey, maybe you me and buddy could go on a journey together”

Smiling to me saying 

“Man that would be great going on a journey”

“I would love nothing but to find myself on an adventure one day!”

With Billy just looking at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me 

“ I want to so bad to find my place in this Life!  I want to just get up from here and go live my Life.”

“But hearing it in my mom and dad’s voice! I can hear them saying that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life”

Just then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him 

“ I hope that one day that you will get better and just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together” 

As Billy then gave buddy one last hug looking at him smiling petting him one last time before we made my our way to front door. To where the authorities were waiting there to take me and buddy back home.

 As we then made our way back home from our little journey pulling back into the drive way! Finding ourselves now back at our farm. I could see my mom as she came running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me 

“Don’t you ever leave me again Dakota! Don’t you ever leave like that again me again” 

hugging my mom saying to her

 “I promise mom I will never leave you again” 

For as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy’ and Journey that me and buddy had went on that day. Thinking to myself settling there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me. Looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me. As she then placed her arms around me with tears in her eyes! 

 Telling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Saying to my mom

“Why! Billy’ can’t die! He was going to get better! So me him and buddy could go on a journey together”

But Just knowing that my mom was setting there with me giving me a hug saying to me 

“Honey I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.” 

For the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.

Looking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom’s letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.

 Thinking of the gentleman that I had met on my journey with buddy that day! And that he was right! When he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood! Are the memories that help us get through our Life as adults today. 

And on that day as I stood there at my mom’s grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy’ so many years ago! What he said to me! For there was a place for him in this life! And for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dad’s memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me. 

For me to grow! To appreciate the Life that I had! For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. 

For There was a place! A Place In Heaven

You can also discover the music your friends were listening to in the same area, and even drop your current music tracks for others to discover. The idea was to turn listening to music, which is usually a solitary experience, into a social and spatial one.

“If the women don’t find you handsome, they should at least find you handy.”
— St. Red of Possum Lodge, First Prophet of the Duct Tape Dialectic

⸻

🔧 Red Green as Proto-SAP

While Red Green was patching boats with lawn chairs and advising on romantic resilience with a wrench in one hand and a coffee in the other, he was preaching the earliest sermons of Social Altruism:
	•	DIY ethics = Anti-corporate autonomy
	•	Loyalty to the Lodge = Inner Circle commitment
	•	Humor over prestige = Rejection of elite pretense
	•	Everyman knowledge = Democratic intelligence

He lived SAP’s values before SAP had a name. A patriot, a philosopher, and a proletarian myth.

⸻

🛠️ Duct Tape as Political Theory

The duct tape wasn’t just a gag. It was symbolic materialism:

“Things don’t need to be perfect—they need to be functional, cooperative, and collectively maintained.”

Red Green was never about throwing out the broken system.
He was about fixing it with what you have, and more importantly, doing it together.

⸻

🍁 Why Red Green is the Average Ol’ Canuck Archetype
	•	A little cynical, a little wise.
	•	Comfortable in overalls and skeptical of the government.
	•	Believes in hard work, loyalty, and finding purpose in the mess.
	•	He doesn’t speak policy—he lives it, with sawdust in his lungs and a loyalty to the lodge that mimics party allegiance.

He is the ideal citizen of SAP’s Canada:
Not concerned with prestige, but with purpose.
Not loyal to parties, but to people.

⸻

📺 Red Green’s Legacy in SAP Propaganda

Imagine:
	•	A retro-poster of Red Green holding up a Canadian flag wrapped in duct tape with the slogan:
“Fix the country with what we’ve got. Start with each other.”
	•	SAP Youth watching reruns of the Red Green Show as part of Foundations of Canadian Wisdom.
	•	“Possum Lodge Communes” as test-sites for local cooperatives where old tools and older ideas are recycled into revolutionary action.

⸻

Red Green didn’t need to preach Social Altruism. He showed us how to live it.
A little broken, a little weird, but proud, loyal, and practical to the core.

It’d be him, duct tape crown and all.",1,1747709891.0,SocialAltruismParty,0,1.0,False

My gf bought a converted Mercedes sprinter and spontaneously asked if I wanted to quit my job and travel around Australia with her. I had some savings and decided fuck yeah.

In terms of my contributions: I do 99% of the driving, and I feel like I cook and clean up after more often than I don’t. In terms of financially, I pay for half of everything, fuel, food, any extras needed for the van, any services, insurance, etc.

I’m not entirely sure I should be paying for half of everything to do with the van as it isn’t mine, I don’t know what’s reasonable.

The reason I’m asking now after all this time is that I feel very unappreciated in what I do do, because my gf complains that I’m not clean and I leave things out (which I’m not denying, I could be more clean as I go) and I need to do more, I don’t have a problem with being more clean it’s the way that everything else I actually do seems to go unnoticed because I’m not on top of everything.

My gf holds the fact that she owns the van over my head, that this life wouldn’t be possible if it wasn’t for her and that any double standards are justified because it’s her van, so in essence I should be doing extra and if she lacks it’s okay it’s her van, not only this but I also should be buying her coffees everyday to show my appreciation that she provided the van.

It’s a bit of a turn to what i expected when being asked to join her, as if we were going on an adventure together, and I believe in contributing to our daily lives fairly equally, and that just because she purchased that van it feels irky that that fact is being used against me even though I was asked to join her in her van

Is it irky? My requests that she do the dishes or cook are met with reluctance, especially after driving for a few hours it’s feels a bit one sided and that I’m being taken advantage of.",1,1747709661.0,relationship_advice,13,0.67,False

**Pan-romantic Ace and proud!** Emotional connection is my love language—physical stuff is strictly DLC, not base game. Ask me anything!

**Forever DM & LARPer**—If your ideal date involves:

- Rolling nat 20s on flirting checks.
- Debating whether ""Lawful Neutral"" is code for ""boring.""
- Overnight LARP events where we pretend we’re not freezing in a tent.
- Crying over fictional characters like it’s our job.…then congratulations, we’re already fanfic OTP material.

**Writer & Professional Story Goblin**—I hoard tropes, re-tellings, and character arcs like a dragon with a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Romance? Love is Blind scenarios? Fresh spins on classic tales? YES. (Bonus if you want to rant about them with me after.)

**Magic: The Gathering Commander Player**—I enjoy:

- Politicking my way to victory.
- ""Friendly"" games that last 4+ hours.
- Arguing whether counterspells are evil (they’re not; cry about it).

**Media Snob with a Heart of Gold**—I’ll tear apart a lazy comic adaptation with citations, but I’ll also cry at a well-done romance subplot. Fight me (or join me; your call.)

**Neuro-divergent mess**—Even simple concepts can confuse me. Will ask alot of clarifying questions even if they have obvious answers. Tend to repeat questions a day or week later due to fogetting.

**Trans Woman**—Proud, open, and living my best life. If that’s an issue, exit stage left before I cast ""Power Word: Cringe"" on you.

**No Casual Mentality**—I’m here for the epic romance arc, not a filler episode.

**Adventure or Bust**—I need someone who actually leaves the house. Yes, cozy nights are great, but if your idea of excitement is only marathon shows, we might not vibe. Road trips, Ren Faires, hiking, spontaneous day trips, or even just exploring weird little towns? Let’s go.

# **Why I’m Objectively Awesome (According to Me & My Cat):**

- Matching Ren Faire/cosplay outfits? Done. Themed date nights? Obviously. Reading fanfic aloud dramatically? Already warming up my voice
- I will learn your ""useless"" fun facts and weaponize them later to make you smile.
- **My love language is physical touch**—translation: I cuddle like it’s my divine purpose.

# **Deal-Breakers (AKA ""Don’t Waste My Time""):**

- **Smoking/vaping or excessive drinking.**
- **Long-distance** outside driving range of **Northern Ohio** (*I’m flexible, but if flying is your only option, hard pass*).
- **Skipping the safety video call** within the first month (*non-negotiable; Not falling for that again!*).
- **Homebodies who never want to explore**—I need a partner-in-crime for actual adventures, not just couch quests.
- **Throwaway accounts**—If your account is less than 3 months old with nothing on it, do not message me. *It basically screams, red flag to me*

# **You Might Be My NPC (Noteworthy Partner Candidate) If You:**

- Believe in ""us against the world"" energy.
- Geek out over D&D backstories, RPG character creators, or Commander deck tech.
- Want someone who’ll bring you tea and listen to your latest 3 AM hyper fixation rant.
- Appreciate **ace-spectrum identities** and emotional intimacy.
- **Love spontaneous adventures**—whether it’s a midnight diner run, a weekend hike, or a last-minute road trip to the world’s largest ball of yarn.

# **The Quest:**

If you’re kind, emotionally mature, and ready to build something real, **message me:“Hi” + your favorite animal + where you read this** (*or I’ll Wild Shape into someone who ghosts you*).

## **Bonus XP if you:**
- Know your D&D alignment with certainty.
- Have ever cried over a fictional relationship.
- Want to argue about MTG’s color pie over coffee.

Two recent arrivals from East Germany, eager to immerse themselves in Austrian life.

The tram hummed past, its red and white silhouette gliding through the grandeur of the Ringstraße. Klaus and Dieter stepped onto the pavement, the scent of roasted chestnuts curling through the crisp autumn air.

“Wien,” Klaus muttered, taking it all in—the golden domes, the intricate facades, the sheer elegance woven into every corner. “This ain’t Karl-Marx-Stadt.”

Dieter chuckled, glancing at a street musician strumming a melody beneath the towering shadow of St. Stephen’s Cathedral. “No, it most definitely is not.”

They wandered past cafés with velvet-lined booths and chandeliers dripping with light—places where people lingered over coffee, unrushed, unbothered. There was an art to it: the stillness, the luxury of time. It felt elegant. Foreign.

But they craved something less delicate, something loud, familiar. So, they chose a pub instead.

Their voices, accustomed to the acoustics of sparsely populated spaces, rang out louder than intended, drawing glances from patrons well-versed in the quiet rhythms of the bar. They flagged the bartender with curt gestures, their bluntness landing heavy in the air. He poured their beers with a tight smile, the kind that masked minor irritation—a ripple of discomfort moving through the room.

Later, the East Germans sat at the bar, their conversation drifting from money to gambling, to smoking—before circling back to the supposed ""uselessness"" of education and literacy.

Coincidentally, a television screen in the corner was displaying an educational program. The host posed a simple yet fundamental question: “What is ‘counter-clockwise’?” The two Germans, unfamiliar with the term, turned to the bartender, hoping he could offer an answer.

The bartender was equally perplexed, his confusion momentarily breaking through his usual demeanor. He scratched his head before pointing in a random direction to his right, hoping he looked knowledgeable. “Definitely that way,” he declared with forced assurance.

Moments later, their attention was drawn back to the mirrored television screen, where the host clearly gestured in one direction while explaining “counter-clockwise.” Viewing it in reverse, they took it as confirmation of the bartender’s explanation.

“He was right!” Dieter exclaimed, jabbing a finger toward the reflected image. They exchanged satisfied nods, assured that they had absorbed another important piece of knowledge about their new environment.

Two weeks later, fueled by a misguided ambition, the Germans found themselves attempting to break into an insurance office. Their first task was to disable the alarm system, a necessary step for their ill-conceived plan. The control panel presented them with a crucial instruction:  “Turn knob counter-clockwise to disarm.” The phrase echoed in their minds, now firmly linked to the bartender’s (and the mirrored television’s) incorrect definition. With misplaced certainty, they rotated the knob clockwise.

The piercing shriek of the alarm shattered the silence, sending their nerves into disarray. The flashing lights and the sound of police sirens arriving quickly brought their plan to a premature end. Within 10 minutes, the two East Germans found themselves being surrounded by policemen.

There are some restrictions on what you can and can't do with this, but beyond those, whatever you pick will simply become a law of the universe. What do you pick, and why? 

The rules: 

Nothing that is already a natural consequence of a given action.  Things like ""if you don't bathe, people won't want to stand next to you on public transit"" are already covered by, well, existing reality. 

It can't be directly relevant legal consequences, you can't simply say ""if you do this crime, you will always be arrested for it"".  Though you can use the legal system as an indirect consequence, for example ""if you drink the last coffee in the break room without turning off the burner or brewing a new pot, police will pull you over for any minor driving infraction""

It has to be something that can reasonably be considered a morally good thing you're being rewarded for, or a morally bad thing you're being punished for.

It has to be proportional. No killing someone for failing to put their shopping cart back, or making someone a millionaire for petting a puppy.

It has to be ""natural""-- What I mean by that is that it has to be something that can already happen to someone, it is just happening at an unusual rate because of this new correlation. For example, people don't just suddenly shrink 2 feet in height, so you can't have that as a consequence for teasing people for being short.  It can be a technology thing, or something like that, but it has to be something that works within the rules of the world we presently live in. 

It has to be either a single thing, or a reasonably inverse good/bad pair.  The reward and the punishment for a given pair do not need to be the same, but they need to be rewards and punishments for things that can reasonably be considered on the same axis.  For example, stopping to help someone in need, versus blatantly and intentionally ignoring someone in need.

The place I chose to go BOTG was every bit as spectacular as I had hoped. I got to hike a few peaks and must have looked like an idiot checking EVERY nook and cranny under, around, and within ancient boulders. 

It’s the best time I ever had losing. 

As I head home, I’m reflecting on some great windshield time that gave me 7 hours to myself which I spent on a combination of cursing my raging confirmation bias, patting myself on the back for building a life and family that allowed me to act on a mid-life crisis instinct to spend a few vacation days in an extremely remote place that is totally outside of my routine. Whoever said that life begins at the edge of your comfort zone was right. It’s just a shame there wasn’t a sweet treasure just over the edge ready to hop in the back of my truck and ride the loneliest highway together. 

I’ve decided to share my solve here for reasons of closure. The time on the ground the last few days really hammered it home to me that I lack the time, energy, fitness, will, determination, and intellect to crack this hunt. Perhaps my research and logic helps one of you inch closer to the treasure or even validate why you ruled somewhere out. 

I haven’t heard anyone mention Nevada here but the place I searched was Lunar Lake which is part of the Lunar Crater Back Country Byway in Nye County, Nevada. You’ll see why I went there when you read on but I want you to know that I’m sharing this fully expecting there to be ridicule and that it’s totally OK to feel that way. This is a competition and anyone should feel good about one more competitor dropping out, regardless of whether you think them as unable to win. 

The odds are with you if you expect others to fail. 1.8m sq miles is a big space. Thousands will likely come up empty so perhaps bear that in mind when rejoicing at another failed attempt. 

***********

The first Stanza of the poem is largely “set up”. It sets the tone for what we’re here to do — find treasure! — while telling us that it won’t be easy — we’ll need wisdom! — and convincing us that there’s perhaps a depth to this solve that will require us to reflect, explore, and take a gamble or risk regretting “a chance we didn’t take”.

The book and the series clearly speak to the importance to Justin of the connections between man, nature, and the stars. Perhaps the poem is telling us that we’ll need to solve this by tapping into the spiritual connections Justin still has to those who are no longer present in our physical realm? His grandfather, his father, his brother, his dog Tucker all had a profound impact on his life and while they all now endure as memories, they moved to the heavenly realm which transcends time. 

Now, let’s get into the specifics of the poem’s solve. 

“As hope surges” tells us that the Vernal Equinox is important. Around March 20th each year is the day that heralds the beginning of Spring in the Northern Hemisphere. In keeping with our themes of spirituality, balance, and duality, this day is significant to the solve. The amount of light and dark that “live in time” that day are both equally balanced. It’s a metaphor for spiritual wisdom, where life’s hopes (light) and life’s depressions (darkness) are not at odds with each other. Call it the ideal moment for some spiritual harmony or inner peace.

On this day each year, “hope springs eternal”. Across the world, Spring signals rebirth and renewa. Man has long since recognized the significance of the Equinox. Stonehenge near where I was born is a great example of the Druids going to seemingly impossible ends to worship this regular natural rhythm. Look into where the Stonehenge slabs of rock were sourced and transported to and you’ll see what I mean. 

The thematic point here is that your journey begins with excitement. You have no baggage; you are balanced. Confirmation bias (darkness) has not yet had the chance to set in. Knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom (light) have not yet had the chance to influence where you look. 

You’re simply thrilled to jump in and find a treasure. 

“Clear and bright” speaks to a sunrise, or at least to early morning hours. The poem harkens to a day of rebirth. To a moment in time where symmetry and balance are in full effect. On this sunny, full of  hope we look to the East for Man’s greatest source of light to guide us on this journey. 

Like Groundhog Day, though, every potential solve we try should tstart with our treasure hunting alarm clock (or our Confirmation Bias demons) waking us with a start over and over again on that same exact day. If we allow our solve to be influenced by the passing of time in our current lives — either subconsciously or not — we’ve missed the intended “point in time” of this journey. The goal is to which lead you to know yourself better than you did before so you must keep trying until you are successful; always starting from the beginning.  

So, to set the stage explicitly, we need to always attempt to solve the poem’s hidden messages as if we are there at the location early on the morning of March 20th, 2025. This is critical. 

Not only is “Walk near waters’ silent flight” our first clue about where the physical hunt should begin, it is also a direct and literal instruction as to what to do when we get there. We’re looking for a place where water has the potential to “disappear” in a number of different ways and perhaps involves multiple types of bodies of water. 

What leads us to start our search at Lunar Lake in Nye County, Nevada involves much more than its significance in terms of water that disappears but let’s start here because it’s our first literal clue to explore so we must address it. Besides, everything hinges on this being right so we can’t commit until we have several solid points of validation all confirming that the treasure’s location is “surrounded by significance”. 

It goes without saying that water can disappear in many ways. The two that are important to this solve are waters that drain away and waters that take “silent flight” by evaporating. To drain, water that once flowed or was pooled needs to find its way either underground or into an ocean. To evaporate, water needs to come into contact with heat. Dry rivers and dry lakes are good examples of draining and, as a dry lake, Lunar Lake fits this bill. The water has literally drained away to leave an exposed lake bed. When you go there, you’re struck by the natural beauty surrounding it. Huge peaks, expansive valleys, and rare geological features are all around. 

One particular type of geological feature is extremely important to our solve at this amazing location which is designated a National Monument. The area is administered by the Bureau of Land Management and therefore free to access 24/7 with dogs welcome, albeit with some protective footwear likely advised.  

Several unmissable geological features next to Lunar Lake provide a glimpse into ancient volcanic activity that would once have lit up the nearby skies like a 4th of July fireworks display. Lunar Crater is a 400 foot deep Maar which is a geologist’s fancy way of describing a collapsed volcano. 

The volcano collapsed under its own weight when fire met water violently. In the form of magma, the earth below was quite literally bursting to get out over 1 million years ago. During its journey to the surface the hot magma encountered water hidden underground (drained from the lake and elsewhere) which evaporated instantly. This reaction coolsed the magma which hardened, resulting in Mother Nature leaving her rather impressive fingerprint on the landscape. 

Having established our starting point, we’re now walking near Lunar Lake and Lunar Crater. 

Where we go next depends on how you read the instructions “Round the bend, past the Hole”. The capitalization of Hole leads me to believe we’re talking about Lunar Crater but it took me a while to parse what seems to be extremely clear, direct, and literal instructions. As an avid cryptic crossword puzzle solver, I’ve developed a habit of reading sentences and phrases at different speeds, with different intonations and different syllabic emphasis every morning over coffee for the last 4 years. 

What if this is back-to-front? It’s totally feasible that the instruction is to go past the hole and then around the bend. In the UK, where I’m from, the phrase “go round the bend” means to go crazy. And I would say it’s this line that held me up the most. One day I’ll share the details of the failed hunt on the ground that my friend did a few weeks prior. I sent him to the wrong place because I did not parse this line right. 

So, if the Hole in question is Lunar Crater, then our bend is the slight chicane or S-curve required by the Eastern lane of US-6 to skirt around Lunar Crater and continue its journey towards the ghost town of Lockes. 

As we round the bend, and straighten out, the treasure — which is also a metaphor for wisdom since when you find it you find a better version of yourself — invites you to “cast your pole”. We know our setter is an avid fisherman so in the same way that a trout fisherman would cast in the direction of Brown treasure, we are invited to look out a little distance in a certain direction. I took this to mean look to the North (pole). When we do that, we can draw a line right through the center of Lunar Lake and head on a bearing directly aligned to the North pole. We also know that the treasure was left “no more than a mile’s hike” from the road. Or words to the effect and this matches that. Roughly 1,000 yards ahead is a geological feature that appears no more significant than the other 50+ of them in the area. Until, you look a little closer from above. . 

I made no secret here that I believe the hunt has deep ties to Greek mythology and also to Freemasonry. The line “double arcs on granite bold” seemed to me like it was designed to be the poem’s most cryptic clue and it’s a connection to mythology that indeed began to cement things for me. 

Later, I’ll go into much more detail about all of the additional things I’ve found that validate this solve but now let’s switch our attention to the significance of the Laurel tree to the ancient Greeks. Athens is the birthplace of civilization and in one particular Greek myth, Apollo, the God of Light turned his to-be-bride (Daphne) into a Laurel tree when it became clear that they could not be together. If he could not have her, no one would. So, this myth reminds us that love can elude even the most powerful of the Gods. Which is why it is largely the reason the earliest winners of the Olympics would be given a Laurel wreath to wear as a sign of their victory. It’s undoubtedly a powerful symbol of victory that has endured for centuries. 

Thanks to Google Earth, it’s now possible to solve a hunt like this from the comfort of your home. Armed with an internet connection and the right obsessive mindset, you can start to piece together clues in a way that’s not just hard to do in-person but in some cases impossible. The treasure was hidden in a geological feature that, from the sky, resembles a victory wreath of Laurel which is essentially two arcs whose bases are entangled in a knot. 

Truly poetic, eh?

Further validation that this was a good spot to explore came from looking at it from above. Next to it is a similar but smaller feature in the shape of the letter “C”. The two features are so close to
each other and oriented so perfectly that they match the shape of the coffee mugs we saw in Gold and Greed. The treasure is hidden in the cup part of the mug, while its neighbor plays the role of the handle. And, I should mention that the ET Fraim padlock in the show is nod to the ghost town Lockes nearby while also topping us off thay the treasure is located near US-6 which is known as the Extra Terrestrial Highway). 

From here, the poem invites us to go “where secrets of the past still hold” and “beyond the reach of time’s swift race” which is simply telling us to rummage around in any dark spots nearby. I felt strongly that Justin would anticipate how us hunters would use technology to find the treasure. Surely he would go to great lengths to make sure that the treasure could be seen via satellite imagery. Interestingly, some commercial imagery companies can get you high resolution images of a spot from a height of just one meter these days. 

So, we’ve found our treasure but you’re likely wondering how that could happen without mentioning the two most important characters mentioned in the poem. “His realm” and “his bride” tell us that there are at least two very significant actors in this poetic play that we need to meet and understand before we can feel confident we’re onto something. And, it’s here that we find the most compelling validations. We are absolutely in the right place for our search. 

The simplest theory is that “His Realm” refers to the Sun and “His Bride” is the Moon. They could be analogous to Justin’s mother and father but for all intents and purposes, that has no bearing on the outcome. The Sun and the Moon give is a level of “technical” solve that syncs perfectly with the more esoteric aspects of it. 

On March 20th, 2025 there was some interesting alignment happening in the skies at Lunar Lake. At the precise moment of sunrise, the Sun rose over the horizon at exactly a 90 degree East of North azimuth. The Moon was in its 3rd phase of the day. It was setting and at sunrise was at an altitude of 20 degrees. As I was researching all things celestial, I learned that the Moon was experiencing a major Lunar standstill on the date in question. This happens once every 18.6 years and is very predictable. It basically means that the Moon’s traversal across the sky is more limited and it’s a small leap of faith for me to think that Justin was well aware of this and factored it into this hunt appropriately. Nothing about this hunt is coincidental, right?

That’s all well and good but is it enough for a “smoking gun”. No, but, when you discover where the Moon could be found in the sky at that precise sunrise moment that day, you should be as convinced as I am. 

At that moment, the Moon was hovering directly over Citadel Mountain at an azimuth of 212 degrees in a SSW direction. You might notice that this is 32 degrees from South. However, due to the Earth’s tilt (which incidentally is the reason why we encounter the Four Season) the bearings for True South and Magnetic South differ at Lunar Lake by 12 degrees due to what is called “Magnetic Declination”. 

If you’ve made it this far you’ve probably connected the dots by now that not only was the Moon at a 20 degree altitude at sunrise on March 20th, 2025 it was at a 20 degree SSW bearing in the sky. Returning to the poem and to the Stanza that I skipped over, we have our final validation which also includes, I think, a rather sarcastic wink to Justin’s Forest Fenn Treasure hunt experience. 

So, as a reminder, the sun is in the sky (“his realm”) “in ursa east” at an exact 90 degree bearing and the Moon (“his bride”) “stands guard” in her “realm” directly over Citadel Mountain. A citadel is literally a city fortified by walls and entered via gates. Citadel Mountain is so-named because the outline at its peak resembles a gateway as do so many peaks in the American West. Now we need to look in the direction of the Moon and then look directly behind us because we are told to “return her face to find the blaze”. 

At this point that I sensed some wit from Justin. The phrase “return her face” does not parse well for me. It’s awkward. And, as It’s in the one part of the poem where the rhyming structure changes briefly, it got my attention. Not to mention that the semi-colon suggests a digital “wink” in emoji terms these days. That’s why I think that we are meant to read this phrase differently. A more traditional and appropriate phrase to use would have been “return her gaze to find the blaze”. 

But, that might have made our lives far too easy, eh?

It appears to me that Justin was very frustrated by Forest Fenn’s “blaze” not being able to withstand the elements. If it had, it’s likely that he would have been the first to find it. Which is why I think he chose a final marker (checkpoint) for this hunt that is a) very clear and easy to find (when you know where to look) and b) highly likely to withstand whatever Mother Nature might throw its way in this remote part of Central Nevada. That Justin’s version of a “blaze” resembles a primitive fire is not lost on me, nor is the fact that when the Moon is directly behind you and you are looking at the blaze it points you to the place in the sky where T Corona Borealis (aka the “Blaze Star”) would have been on March 20th, 2025. When Justin first hid this treasure in 2023 some were predicting that T CrB would shine extremely brightly in the night sky for a few days on or around March 27th, 2025 which coincidentally is when the show first aired. 

Before moving to the final Stanza, we need to check off one last important line which I think may have several meanings. “Wonder guards this sacred space” first led me to believe that it referred to a very prominent geological feature which towers over Lunar Lake and the treasure. More on other symbolic links to this particular part of the solve are below but it’s worth noting that this feature — called The Wall — is comprised of a few faulted horsts. Faulted horsts are characterized by repeating rectangular shaped peaks paired with depressions in between. They seemingly only happen when the earth expands in a Westward direction. Not only is Justin guiding us to reflect on how American pioneers adventured West, and then into Space but perhaps he’s also pointing put that at Lunar Lake the earth is literally straining to move West too. 

How poetic!

That aside, when you look at the treasure’s resting place on Google Earth from above, the rim (which is the base of the two arcs of Laurel) is coated in ash in a pattern which resembles an eagle with its wings spread wide. It’s a pretty cool image. Since you might be hard-pressed to find a bird or animal that is more revered by every civilization in history than the eagle, this was the final clue that encouraged me to get on a plane today. 

Wrapping this all up is the final Stanza of the poem. Perhaps I’ll update this once I’ve found the treasure since I suspect its physical appearance gives a nod to the themes of self-discovery, reflection, exploration, adventure, and balance. It would not surprise me if its surface is reflective like a mirror or in the form of a double-headed eagle. 

As I write this, my plane is in its final descent into Las Vegas from where I intend to venture beyond my daily routine and take a “gamble” on being right. My dog’s name is Blaze (named by my kids with no knowledge of treasure hunts). A recent crossword puzzle included the answers “Find” and “Treasure” and a sermon at Church this morning (where my son was featured for his recent graduation from High School) focused on “treasure” as the key word. I take these all as signs to go follow my instincts in search of wisdom. Thank you Justin for creating such a fun playground for intellectual, spiritual, and physical exploration. 

If my solve is wrong and the treasure eludes me, that’s OK. The additional spoils would be nice but like I told my family before leaving, the hunt is the victory for me and this is an itch I just have to scratch!

- In 1969, the Apollo 11 mission was man’s first extraterrestrial adventure and exploration that was successful. On the same day as the Apollo 11 moon landing, Pink Floyd played a jam session for BBC Radio 1 in London, and out of that session an obscure track called “Moonhead” was the result not the to mention their link to The Wall
- Justin was born the year that Pink Floyd released their album entitled Darkside of the Moon.That album contains a track called Time.
- The land which includes Lunar Crater and Lunar Lake was commissioned in 1973. Rather than being established as a national park, it is managed by the BLM which means it is accessible for free and dogs are allowed.
In preparation for the Apollo missions, and several times since, NASA has used this local area to conduct training of astronauts and to test some of their Rover vehicles due to this area bearing a unique resemblance on earth to what the astronauts would encounter on the surface of the moon
- In terms of this land being sacred, it’s my belief that indigenous tribes consider peaks, valleys, bodies of water, and geological “anomalies” as sacred. 
- Just as the Netflix show was being released, its timing coincided with a prediction that a once in a lifetime celestial event would be taking place in the night sky. Known as “The Blaze Star”, T Corona Borealis (aka T CrB) is expected to collapse anytime soon.
Around the time that Justin planted the treasure and started to record the Netflix show, the prediction for this date was very specific. It was March 27, 2025. This event, known as a recurrent nova happens only every 80 years. 
When it collapses T CrB will grow in magnitude to a 2.0 star in the sky, meaning it will go from not being visible to the naked eye to being very visible for a number of days. Think about how poetic it is to launch the show just a few days before this amazing event in the sky. 
- T CrB is a binary star and it’s collapse happens every 80 years as a result of it having gathered so much mass and material from the previous collapse of its coupled star 80 years prior that it explodes which begins the cycle again. Thematically, this aligns perfectly with the theme of this treasure hunt, which is that the connection between man, nature and the stars transcends time. It is infinite. It’s akin to a river’s, steady flow.
- In terms of using the maps and hints to find the starting location, it’s important to point out that I believe that Alaska being included in Posey’s map, but not being contiguous to the other Western states is critical
- If you plot these four points on Google Earth and connect them as huge X, the intersection point is very close to Lunar Lake. If plotted extremely precisely, it’s likely the intersection point would be Lunar Lake. 
1. The last of the Aleutian or Andreanof islands off the coast of Alaska (the most north westerly western point on his map which did not include Little Diomede because it would have put the X intersection at a very different point) 
2. The upper East corner of Montana (the most northeasterly point on his map)
3. The area just south and west of Big Bend National Park in Texas (the most south easterly point on his map)
4. The Channel Islands (of with San Nicolas island is one — the patron saint of explorers, by the way — and the most south westerly point on the map)
- The angzzar and the logo of the book and website point to the final spot of the treasure (call it the “small” X) being north and east of the intersection of the giant X that spans the Western US. If you rotate that X so that the Aleutian islands represent due North, the final Blaze is right where the pointer in the logo points to the small X. 
- The 1 oz Brittania coin pictured in the book bears an uncanny resemblance to the final blaze marker . 
- The American Eagle coin on its obverse is an eagle coming into land holding an olive branch. 
The Laurel wreaths and Queen Elizabeth on the coins point to the features I located
- The infinity symbol on the pen resembles the horizontal numbers as they appear of Nevada Highway miles markers. 
- Highway 318 gets you there which is the date of the Spring equinox and a time on the clock

In terms of financially, I pay for half of everything, fuel, food, any extras needed for the van, any services, insurance, etc. 

I’m not entirely sure I should be paying for half of everything to do with the van as it isn’t mine, I don’t know what’s reasonable. 

The reason I’m asking now after all this time is that I feel very unappreciated in what I do do, because my gf complains that I’m not clean and I leave things out (which I’m not denying, I could be more clean as I go) and I need to do more, I don’t have a problem with being more clean it’s the way that everything else I actually do seems to go unnoticed because I’m not on top of everything. 

My gf holds the fact that she owns the van over my head, that this life wouldn’t be possible if it wasn’t for her and that any double standards are justified because it’s her van, so in essence I should be doing extra and if she lacks it’s okay it’s her van, not only this but I also should be buying her coffees everyday to show my appreciation that she provided the van. 

It’s a bit of a turn to what i expected when being asked to join her, as if we were going in an adventure together, and I believe in contributing to our daily lives fairly equally, and that just because she purchased that van it feels irky that that fact is being used against me even though I was asked to join her in her van

So I guess, do I contribute enough?
Is it necessary that I pay for half of every service and fix that the van needs on the road?
And am I right to be irked out by her holding the fact that she paid for the van over my head?",1,1747708638.0,Advice,4,0.67,False

I have a pretty good idea of my MBTI, but I wanted to know what others thought. Don't look in my profile.

I love the seaside. Not really going out into the sun and water but at a restaurant, sipping coffee, and looking out. I like doing math, and I enjoy problem solving in general. I'm also lazy, but up for a challenge. Winter is my favorite season, not so much the cold, but the snow, the holidays, and a chance to take a break. I like a chill outfit that looks well put together at the same time. My favorite artist is Laufey. My favorite animals are cats. I also love video games, my favorite genre being RPGs. I don't like small talk, and I'm pretty bad with people. I have a very serious face, and talk with a passive-aggressive tone, so many mistake me for having other intentions.

I feel like this isn't what you would typically expect from others of my same supposed type. Some of these pictures don't do me justice, and IRL I'm probably different from impressions you would get online. Anyways, happy typing.",1,1747708446.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

Apparently that inspired the ire of a vegan keyboard crusader who owns a vegan bakery to berate me (and a few others in the comments) about how we don’t care about animals and our egos are driving us to pay money to intentionally support the harm and killing of innocent animals…

Ironically, I actually cut down on my meat and dairy intake years ago while living abroad. Most of my friends were either vegetarian or vegan out of environmental and animal rights concerns. While I don’t have the same ethical concern about animals rights, I do try to reduce harm as much as possible. I only buy farm raised eggs cause I care about buying eggs from sources that can give them a decent quality of life. If I can’t afford them, I don’t buy them. I don’t regularly buy milk or cream, it’s not a regular part of my diet anymore. I often buy coconut milk and creamer for my coffee even. I don’t eat red meat at home because of the huge environmental cost and I can’t afford to buy beef from ethical sources. Most of my protein intake comes from chicken, beans, lentils. I often replace meat with beans or lentils at home and even eating out. 

Not that I need to justify myself. But nonetheless. I know this is just par for the Social media course, which is why I don’t get on often. I was dumb enough to feed the troll. Tried to deflect at first by just saying this wasn’t the way to convince me to choose to be vegan. But they pressed. With a tirade of insults about me not caring about animals, being ignorant, a hypocrite, etc. 

Again, I know it’s social media riff raff. And I’m stressed about other stuff going on at work. It’s just a particularly annoying and stupid fucking thing in the wrong time. But people like this are just the sleaziest. Like I get calling attention to shit and holding people accountable when they do bad shit. But call-out culture on social media is already bad enough.

1kqtun5,https://youtu.be/zxeKJnjmaz8,3 Very Scary TRUE Camping Natural Disasters Horror Stories,"**""Trapped by the Flames"":**

I pulled into Mammoth Pool Reservoir with my two best friends, thrilled for a Labor Day weekend escape. The lake shimmered under the sunlight, its edges fringed with towering Ponderosa pines and cedars. The air carried the sharp scent of pine needles and damp earth. We picked a spot close to the water, where the ground was soft and littered with pinecones. I hauled my tent from the car while Taylor, always the planner, unpacked the cooler, her voice bright. “Who’s ready for hot dogs and s’mores tonight?” she called, holding up a bag of marshmallows. Jake, already kicking off his shoes, grinned and tossed a frisbee my way. “Let’s hit the lake first,” he said, sprinting toward the water. I laughed, feeling light, like the world was ours for the weekend.We spent the afternoon swimming, the lake cold enough to make me gasp but refreshing. Jake tried to dunk Taylor, who splashed him back, shrieking with laughter. Later, we sprawled on a blanket, eating sandwiches and passing around a bag of chips. The campground buzzed with other families and groups, kids running between tents, someone strumming a guitar nearby. As evening fell, we built a fire, the crackle of burning wood mixing with the soft lapping of the lake. I skewered a marshmallow, watching it turn golden. Then I noticed the sun, low on the horizon, glowing an eerie blood-orange. “Does that look normal to you?” I asked, pointing. Taylor squinted, her brow furrowing. “Maybe it’s just haze or something. A fire far off?” Jake glanced up, then shrugged, but I caught him staring at the sky a moment longer. We brushed it off, told stories, and crawled into our tents, the lake’s gentle rhythm lulling me to sleep.Morning came, and the air felt different—thicker, with a faint smoky tang that made my nose itch. I unzipped my tent and stepped out, rubbing my eyes. The sky was hazy, the sun a dull red disk. Other campers were moving fast, folding chairs and stuffing bags into cars. A man nearby was on his phone, his voice sharp. “They’re saying a fire’s spreading. We need to go now,” he told his wife, who was corralling their kids. My stomach knotted. I found Taylor and Jake by the lake, both staring at the horizon where a grayish plume rose. “This doesn’t feel right,” I said, my voice low. Taylor bit her lip. “Should we pack up?” Jake nodded, his usual grin gone. “Let’s check the road first, see if it’s clear.”We threw our gear into Jake’s truck, not bothering to fold the tents properly. A line of cars was already inching toward the only road out, tires kicking up clouds of dust. My hands were sweaty, gripping the door handle. “It’s probably fine,” I said, more to myself than anyone. Taylor didn’t answer, her eyes fixed on the road. Then the line stopped. Up ahead, I saw it—flames dancing along the ridge, bright and hungry, licking at the trees. A ranger stood in the middle of the road, arms waving. “Turn back! Road’s blocked!” he shouted. My heart slammed against my ribs. “Blocked?” Taylor whispered, her voice trembling. “What do we do now?” Jake’s knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. “We go back to the lake. It’s our best shot.”The campground was chaos when we returned. People were running, grabbing whatever they could—coolers, blankets, kids’ toys. A woman tripped, spilling a bag of clothes, and her husband pulled her up, their faces pale. The smoke was thicker now, curling into my lungs, making my eyes sting. The fire’s roar was unmistakable, a low, relentless growl, like a train bearing down. Someone—a man with a baseball cap—yelled, “Get to the water! It’s the only safe place!” I grabbed Taylor’s hand, and we ran, Jake right behind us. We left everything—tents, food, my backpack with my phone charger—nothing mattered but reaching the lake.The water was shockingly cold as I waded in, my sneakers sinking into the muddy bottom. I went up to my knees, then my waist, the heat from the air pressing against my skin like a physical weight. Taylor clung to my arm, her breath fast. “Are we going to die?” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the fire’s roar. I swallowed, my throat dry. “No. Help’s coming. We just have to stay calm.” But my own fear was clawing at me. Jake stood close, scanning the shore. “Look at that,” he said, pointing. The flames were visible now, leaping from tree to tree, their glow lighting the smoke-filled sky.Dozens of us were in the lake—families, couples, even a few dogs swimming nervously. A woman nearby held her golden retriever, murmuring, “It’s okay, buddy, we’re okay.” Some people were chest-deep, dunking their heads to cool off. Embers floated down, glowing like tiny fireflies, hissing as they hit the water. The heat was unbearable, like standing in an oven, and I kept splashing water on my face, my arms, anything to ease it. My legs ached from standing, the cold seeping into my bones. I checked my phone, but the screen showed no bars. “Anything?” Jake asked. I shook my head. “Nothing.”Hours dragged on. The fire’s roar grew louder, closer, branches snapping and crashing in the distance. The sky was nearly black, lit only by the orange glow of flames creeping down the hills. A man waded past, his arm red and blistered, wincing with every step. His wife held him up, her face streaked with soot. “He got too close to the shore,” she said to no one in particular. I felt sick, helpless. “What if no one knows we’re here?” I said, my voice cracking. Jake shook his head, but his eyes were wide, scared. “They know. They have to.” Taylor’s teeth chattered, from cold or fear, I couldn’t tell. “I just want to go home,” she whispered.The sound came faintly at first, a rhythmic chopping, almost drowned out by the fire. I thought I was imagining it. Then someone shouted, “Helicopters!” I strained to see through the smoke, my heart leaping. Dark shapes emerged, their blades slicing the air, red lights blinking. Relief flooded me, but fear clung tight. The helicopters hovered, unable to land on the water. “They’ll take the injured first!” a woman yelled, her voice steady despite everything. “Stay calm!” Soldiers rappelled down, their figures shadowy in the haze, guiding people into harnesses. A teenage girl with a broken leg was lifted first, her face pale but her eyes open. A man with burns on his hands went next, grimacing as they strapped him in.We waited, the cold water numbing my legs, the heat from the fire still searing my face. Embers kept falling, one landing on my sleeve, burning a tiny hole before I brushed it off. The fire was so close now, I could hear trees exploding, their sap boiling. I dunked my head under, the water muffling the chaos, but the fear stayed. When I came up, Taylor was crying, her hands shaking. “I can’t do this much longer,” she said. I hugged her, my own tears mixing with the lake water. “We’re almost there,” I said, hoping I sounded convincing.Finally, a soldier waved us over. “You three, let’s move!” My legs were heavy, sluggish, as we waded out. The water dragged at me, like it didn’t want to let go. They strapped us into a basket, the harness rough against my wet clothes. The helicopter’s roar filled my ears as we were lifted, the ground falling away. I looked down, my stomach lurching. The lake was a small, dark patch, surrounded by a sea of fire, flames licking at the shore where we’d stood. Tents were gone, reduced to ash. I gripped Taylor’s hand, her fingers icy.The flight felt endless, the smoke still thick even in the air. We landed at a shelter in Fresno, a big building filled with cots and volunteers. Someone wrapped a blanket around me, handed me a bottle of water. My hands shook as I drank, the plastic crinkling. Taylor collapsed onto a cot, hugging her knees. “I thought we were done,” she said, her voice hoarse. I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. Jake sat nearby, staring at the floor, his face smudged with soot. “We made it,” he said, almost like he was convincing himself.Later, we heard the numbers—over 200 people rescued, some with burns, broken bones, or smoke inhalation, but no one died. The news called it a miracle, showed footage of the helicopters, the burning forest. I couldn’t watch. Every time I close my eyes, I see that blood-orange sun, feel the lake’s cold grip, hear the fire’s relentless roar. We survived, but I left something behind in that water—maybe the part of me that thought nothing could go wrong. The shelter was warm, safe, but I kept waiting for the sound of flames, for the moment we’d have to run again.





**""Night of the Raging Storm"":**

I rolled into Grand Haven State Park with my partner, Lisa, our old hatchback stuffed with camping gear—tent, sleeping bags, a cooler of food. The lake stretched out beside the campground, its surface catching the light, and the air smelled of pine and sand. Families dotted the area, kids running between sites, parents unloading chairs and grills. We found our spot, a sandy clearing near the dunes, maybe fifty yards from the water. I hammered the tent stakes deep, the mallet thudding against metal. Lisa tossed her backpack inside, grinning. “This is gonna be great,” she said, brushing dirt off her jeans. I nodded, feeling the stress of work slip away.We spent the afternoon exploring. The dunes rose behind us, soft hills of sand dotted with grass. We walked the shoreline, barefoot, the cool water lapping at our toes. Lisa picked up a smooth stone, turning it over in her hand. “Think it’ll rain?” she asked, glancing at the horizon where dark clouds bunched up. I squinted at the sky. “Might sprinkle. Nothing serious.” Back at camp, we built a fire, the crackle of wood mixing with the hum of the campground. We roasted hot dogs, their smoky scent making my mouth water. Nearby, a group of campers played cards, their laughter loud. “This is perfect,” Lisa said, leaning against me. I agreed, savoring the moment.After dinner, we sat by the fire, watching embers float up. The clouds had crept closer, but I didn’t think much of it. We swapped stories about old camping trips, Lisa giggling about the time she forgot bug spray and got eaten alive by mosquitoes. Around midnight, we doused the fire, the hiss of water on coals filling the air. Inside the tent, we zipped our sleeping bags together, the nylon rustling. The campground grew still, just the faint sound of waves lulling me to sleep.A deafening crack snapped me awake. The tent shook like it was caught in a giant’s fist, the fabric whipping back and forth. Lisa grabbed my arm, her nails digging in. “Wake up! There’s a storm, and it’s bad!” she yelled, her voice sharp with panic. I fumbled for my phone—3:00 AM. Thunder boomed, so loud it rattled my bones. The wind screamed, bending the tent poles inward until they creaked. Rain hammered the roof, leaking through the seams. “We can’t stay here!” I shouted, my heart pounding. I unzipped the door, and a gust of water slammed into my face, soaking me.We crawled out, the ground quaking under us. Lisa’s flashlight beam jerked wildly, catching shredded tents and scattered gear in the chaos. The wind roared through the trees, their branches thrashing like they might snap. “Where do we go?” Lisa cried, her voice nearly lost in the noise. I remembered a bathroom building near the campground entrance, a solid brick structure. “Over there!” I yelled, grabbing her hand. We ran, stumbling over roots and debris, the rain stinging like needles. My shoes sank into the mud, each step heavier than the last.The bathroom building loomed ahead, its outline barely visible. I yanked the door—locked. My stomach dropped. “It’s no good!” I shouted, pounding the handle in frustration. Lisa’s eyes were wide, her wet hair plastered to her face. “What now?” she screamed, her voice breaking. A massive branch crashed nearby, the sound like a gunshot. The trees around us groaned, their trunks bending dangerously. I pulled Lisa to the side of the building, pressing us against the wall to block the wind. “We’ll stay here!” I said, but my voice shook. The wall felt cold and flimsy, and the smell of wet earth and pine filled my nose.Lisa huddled close, shivering in her soaked jacket. “What if we don’t make it?” she whispered, her teeth chattering. I squeezed her hand, trying to sound sure. “We will. It’s just a storm.” But doubt clawed at me. The wind was relentless, howling like a living thing. Something heavy scraped across the ground—a picnic table, maybe, or a cooler—its screech cutting through the noise. My mind raced. Were we safe here? A tree creaked loudly, too close, and I pictured it crashing down on us. I scanned the darkness, my eyes stinging from the rain, and spotted another building, maybe a shower block, a hundred feet away. “Let’s try that!” I shouted, pointing.We sprinted, slipping in the mud, Lisa’s flashlight flickering. My legs burned, and every step felt like a gamble. The shower building’s door swung open, banging against the wall. We stumbled inside, collapsing onto the cold, gritty tile. The air smelled of damp concrete and mildew, but the walls felt solid. “Is this safe?” Lisa asked, her voice trembling as she wiped water from her face. I nodded, catching my breath. “Better than out there.” We crouched in a corner, the wind still howling outside, rattling the metal roof. A loud crash echoed—another tree, maybe, or something bigger. Lisa flinched, grabbing my arm. “It’s so close,” she whispered.I pulled her close, her wet clothes soaking mine. The storm’s noise was deafening—thunder, wind, the crack of branches. My mind kept replaying that branch falling, the locked bathroom door. What if we’d stayed there? Lisa’s breathing was fast, her eyes darting to the door. “Do you think it’s over?” she asked after a quieter moment. I listened, hopeful, but then a new gust hit, stronger, shaking the walls. “Not yet,” I said, my voice tight. We sat there, tense, counting seconds between thunderclaps, each one a reminder of how small we were. The taste of fear lingered in my mouth, sharp and metallic.Time dragged. My watch said 4:30 AM, but it felt like days. Lisa leaned against me, her eyes half-closed but alert. “I just want it to stop,” she murmured. I nodded, stroking her hair, but I was just as scared. The wind seemed to toy with us, easing up, then roaring back. Another crash outside made us both jump, and I wondered how many trees were left standing. The thought of the campground, our tent, everything we’d brought—it all felt so far away, like a dream.Finally, the storm began to fade, the thunder rolling softer, the wind dropping to a low moan. By 5:00 AM, it was quiet enough to hear our own breathing. I stood, my legs stiff, and peeked outside. The sky was still dark, but the rain had slowed to a drizzle. “Think it’s safe?” Lisa asked, standing beside me. “Let’s check,” I said, stepping out. The air was heavy, thick with the smell of wet wood and earth.The campground was a wreck. Tents lay in heaps, some torn to shreds, others tangled in branches. Picnic tables were flipped, one cracked in half. A cooler floated in a puddle, its lid gone. Our tent was a crumpled mess, the poles bent like straws. Lisa stared, her face pale. “We could’ve been in there,” she said softly. I swallowed hard, picturing it.A camper approached, an older man with a gray beard, his jacket soaked. “You folks okay?” he asked, his voice rough. “Yeah,” I said, my throat dry. “You?” He nodded, rubbing his neck. “Barely. Heard a guy in town didn’t make it. Tree fell on his car.” Lisa gasped, covering her mouth. I felt a chill, the words sinking in. A tree. Just like the ones we’d heard falling. “That’s awful,” I managed, my voice hollow.We salvaged what we could—our sleeping bags, a few clothes, the cooler half-full of water. The tent was useless, its fabric ripped. Other campers milled around, some crying, others packing up in silence. A woman nearby hugged her kids, their faces streaked with dirt. I helped Lisa load the car, my hands shaking. The lake looked calm now, its surface smooth, like it was mocking us. We drove out without talking, the hum of the engine the only sound. I kept hearing that wind, those crashes, Lisa’s scared voice. We’d made it, but the fear stuck with me, heavy and real. We were lucky—too lucky.





**""Escape from the Flames: A Whiskeytown Nightmare"":**

I was sprawled on a blanket by the campfire, the crackle of burning logs mixing with the kids’ laughter as they skewered marshmallows, their faces glowing in the firelight. We were deep into our second day at Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, a spot we’d picked for its clear lake and shady pines. The morning had been perfect—splashing in the water, the kids chasing minnows, their squeals bouncing off the trees. My wife sat cross-legged beside me, cradling a tin mug of coffee, her hair still damp from a swim. Our daughter, Lily, eight and fearless, was teasing her older brother, Ethan, ten and cautious, about who could make the gooiest s’more. The air smelled of pine and smoke, warm and familiar. But then I caught it—a sharper scent, like burning leaves, cutting through the campfire’s cozy haze. I shifted, uneasy, my eyes scanning the trees.“You smell that?” I murmured to my wife, keeping my voice low. The kids were giggling, oblivious, but I didn’t want to spook them.She inhaled, her nose wrinkling. “Yeah. Maybe another campsite? Someone burning trash?” Her tone was light, but her eyes flicked to the horizon, searching.I nodded, trying to convince myself it was nothing. We’d heard a snippet on the car radio that morning, a news report about a fire a few miles west, sparked by a trailer’s blown tire scraping metal on the road. The reporter said it was small, contained, no threat to the park. But the smell was stronger now, acrid, clinging to the back of my throat. I stood, brushing dirt off my jeans, and peered through the trees. The sky was still clear, but far off, near the hills, there was a faint orange tint, like a sunset that didn’t belong. My stomach twisted, a knot of worry I couldn’t shake.“Dad, why’s it so smoky?” Lily asked, her marshmallow dripping, her brows knit together.“Just campfires, kiddo,” I said, forcing a grin. “Everyone’s probably roasting marshmallows like you.” But my voice sounded thin, even to me.Ethan, always quick to sense trouble, set his stick down. “Is it that fire from the radio? The one they said was far away?” His eyes were wide, darting to the trees.My wife leaned forward, resting a hand on his knee. “It’s fine, Ethan. They’ve got firefighters handling it. Let’s just enjoy our s’mores, okay?” But when she glanced at me, her lips were tight, her calm facade cracking.We tried to keep the evening normal. Lily told a silly story about a fish that stole her goggles, and Ethan chimed in, his voice wobbling but trying to laugh. I poked at the fire, sending sparks into the air, but I couldn’t stop sniffing, couldn’t stop glancing at the horizon. The haze was thicker now, curling through the pines like fog, and the orange glow was brighter, pulsing faintly. By dusk, tiny flakes of ash began to fall, soft and gray, dusting our picnic table, sticking to my hair. It was eerie, like snow in July, and my chest tightened with every breath.“Should we pack up?” my wife whispered, her voice barely audible over the kids’ chatter. She was folding a blanket, her hands moving too fast, betraying her nerves.“Let’s wait a bit,” I said, though I wasn’t sure why. “They’d tell us if it was serious, right?” But the words felt hollow. The air was heavy, the smell sharp enough to sting my eyes. I pulled out my phone—no signal, just a blank screen mocking me. The campground was quiet, too quiet, the usual hum of crickets replaced by a strange stillness.Around eight, a ranger’s truck rumbled into the campground, its headlights slicing through the smoky air. A man in a green uniform stepped out, megaphone crackling. “Attention, folks!” his voice boomed. “There’s a fire a few miles out. It’s not close yet, but pack your gear, be ready to leave if we give the word. Stay calm, but move quick.”The campground erupted into motion. Families we’d nodded to earlier were scrambling, folding chairs, zipping sleeping bags. A woman across the way dropped a cooler, apples rolling into the dirt. My wife started tossing food into our cooler, her hands trembling. “We need to get the tent down,” she said, her voice low but urgent.“Not yet,” I said, my heart racing. “They said it’s not close. Let’s just… get stuff ready.” But I was second-guessing myself. Ethan was at my side, clutching my sleeve. “Dad, are we gonna be okay?” His voice was small, his eyes glassy.“Absolutely,” I said, ruffling his hair. “We’re just being extra careful, buddy.” But my pulse was hammering, and Lily was watching me, her stuffed bear hugged tight, waiting for me to make it okay.By nine, the air was choking, the haze so thick it blurred the trees. Ash fell heavier, coating our car, piling on the picnic table like gray snow. The orange glow was unmistakable now, a wall of light creeping over the hills. My throat burned, and the kids were coughing, their faces smudged with soot. I tried the radio again, catching fragments of a broadcast: “…Carr Fire… moving fast… evacuate Whiskeytown…” The signal cut out, leaving static.A new sound broke through—sirens, faint but growing louder. Headlights flashed, and a fire truck roared in, followed by the ranger’s truck. A firefighter, face streaked with sweat, banged on our table. “Evacuate now!” he shouted, his voice raw. “Fire’s jumping the ridge. Get to your cars, head to Shasta High School. Move!”Panic slammed into us. Lily burst into tears, her bear falling into the dirt. Ethan froze, his mouth open, staring at the firefighter. My wife grabbed their hands, pulling them toward the car. “Come on, now!” she said, her voice sharp, cracking with fear. I tore at the tent, yanking stakes from the ground, my hands slipping, ash sticking to my sweat. The campground was chaos—people shouting, engines revving, a dog barking wildly. A man ran past, yelling about his keys, his face pale. The air was scorching, the smell overwhelming, like burning rubber and wood.I stuffed the tent into the trunk, not bothering to fold it, and tossed in bags, chairs, anything I could grab. My wife buckled the kids into the backseat, Lily sobbing, “I want to go home!” Ethan was whispering, “It’s coming, it’s coming,” over and over. “Get in!” I yelled, slamming the trunk. I slid into the driver’s seat, my hands slick on the wheel, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat. The kids’ coughs filled the car, and my wife was coughing too, her eyes watering.The road out was a nightmare. Cars jammed the narrow path, taillights glowing red through the smoke. Horns blared, voices shouted, and the haze was so thick I could barely see ten feet ahead. The orange glow was everywhere now, flames visible on the hills, tall and furious, devouring trees with a roar I could hear over the engine. My throat was raw, my eyes stinging, but I gripped the wheel, inching forward. The kids were crying, Lily’s sobs loud and ragged, Ethan’s quieter but just as desperate.“Dad, look!” Ethan shouted, pointing right. The fire was closer, leaping across a field, sparks swirling like angry wasps. The heat pressed through the windows, the air shimmering. I floored the gas, swerving around a stalled car, its driver waving frantically. “We’re okay,” my wife said, turning to the kids, her voice shaking. “We’re getting out, just hold on.” But her hand gripped mine, her nails digging in, and I saw the terror in her eyes.A deafening boom shook the ground, so loud the kids screamed. A fireball erupted on the hill, maybe a propane tank or a car, I couldn’t tell. Sparks rained down, pinging off the hood, and I swerved, my heart in my throat. “What was that?” Lily wailed. “It’s fine!” I shouted, though I didn’t believe it. The road curved, and I saw it—a massive tree, burning, sprawled across half the lane. Cars were squeezing past, tires screeching, one scraping against the flaming branches. “Hold on!” I yelled, gunning the engine, the car lurching as we scraped by, the heat so intense I thought the windows would crack.The fire was everywhere, flames jumping across the road, trees glowing red, the roar deafening, like a beast chasing us. I glanced in the rearview mirror and saw it—flames licking the road behind us, closing in, maybe a hundred yards back. My lungs burned, my hands shook, but I kept driving, following the faint red of taillights. The road widened, pavement replacing dirt, and we burst out of the smoke, the flames fading behind us.We reached Shasta High School around one a.m., the parking lot a sea of cars, people huddled in blankets, some crying, others staring blankly. A volunteer handed us water and masks, and I gulped the water, my throat like sandpaper. The kids clung to us, their faces black with ash, Lily still clutching her bear, now gray with soot. My wife leaned against me, her body trembling. “We made it,” she whispered, but her voice broke, tears cutting tracks through the grime on her face.Later, at the evacuation center, we heard the news. The Carr Fire had ripped through Whiskeytown, destroying the campground, leaving nothing but ash where our tent had stood. I kept replaying it—the smoke, the flames, that explosion, the tree blocking our escape. We were safe, but the fear lingered, heavy as the ash that still clung to my skin. Nature had turned on us, relentless and unforgiving, and I’d never felt so powerless.",1,1747707423.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
