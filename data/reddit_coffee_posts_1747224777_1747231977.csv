For years, I've wanted to offer a mushroom coffee that included Amanita. I've tried countless different mushroom coffee blends and have experimented with my own blends time and time again. I was never quite satisfied with the end product, so we never released anything, and we decided to put it on the back burner.

A couple of months ago, I was talking to Gabe, and we decided we wanted to start pursuing the mushroom coffee blend again. Within two days of us putting out the intention, a friend introduced me to Roel and Maria, the owners of Nuestro Cafe, who were looking to incorporate amanita into their mushroom coffee blend. There was an immediate connection. Two beautiful souls, and a synergy between myself, them and their team. I was happy to work with them and provide them amanita, but it wasn't until I tried their finished product that I realized how special it really was. 

Out of all my searching, for my own palate and physiology, this is the best mushroom coffee blend out there, and the incorporation of Amanita makes it even better. There truly is nothing else like this on the market. 

It's a little expensive, but once you taste it and experience it, you'll see why. The flavor is incredible, and the effects are calming stimulation that seems to produce a flow state with every cup. 

Each serving contains 250mg of Amanita muscaria, but with the synergy of all the ingredients, it oftentimes feels like there is much more. 

I'm really pleased to announce our new partnership with Nuestro Cafe, and to offer you three new amazing products unlike anything else on the market.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Many people drink sweet drinks. Too much sugar is not good. Can matcha help? It is a green tea powder. More people drink it now. People ask, ""Will matcha help me lose weight?"" I will write about this. We will see if science says it can help. And I will tell you how to use it. Then, you can decide if matcha is for you.

What is Matcha and How Does it Differ from Regular Green Tea?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Matcha is special green tea. It is like flour. Farmers grow tea in the shade. Then, they grind it to a fine powder. When we drink normal green tea, we soak tea leaves in hot water. We throw away the leaves. But with matcha, we drink the whole leaf. This means we get more good things. More power. More healthy stuff than normal green tea. It is very strong.

The Powerhouse Compounds in Matcha for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------------

Matcha has good things inside. These can help with weight loss. I will talk about three things. First, EGCG. This is a strong fighter. It can help the body burn more. Next, caffeine. It gives you energy. It may also burn fat. Last, L-Theanine. It helps you calm down. Stress can make you gain weight. This tea can help you stay calm.

How Matcha May Aid Your Weight Loss Efforts
-------------------------------------------

Matcha can help lose weight. It works in some ways.

### Boosting Metabolism and Fat Burning

Matcha may help your body work faster. EGCG and caffeine together do this. The body burns more energy. It also burns fat. Studies show matcha helps when you exercise. You burn more fat when you move.

### Supporting Appetite Control and Satiety

Matcha can stop you from feeling hungry. It may make you feel full. The energy from L-Theanine is steady. No ups and downs. This stops you from eating snacks. You do not get a sugar crash.

Beyond Weight Loss: Other Health Benefits of Matcha
---------------------------------------------------

Matcha is not only for weight loss. It is good for you in other ways too.

### Antioxidant Power and Cellular Health

Matcha has many good fighters. They fight bad things in your body. These are called free radicals. Fighting them helps you stay healthy. It can stop you from getting sick. It is good for your whole body.

### Improving Focus and Energy Levels

Matcha can help you think better. It gives you energy. But it is not like coffee. It is smooth. The caffeine and L-Theanine work together. You do not get the jitters. You stay focused on your plan to lose weight.

Practical Tips for Using Matcha for Weight Loss
-----------------------------------------------

I will give you tips on how to use matcha. This will help you lose weight.

### Best Time to Drink Matcha for Weight Loss

Drink matcha at good times. Drink it before you exercise. Or between meals. Do not drink it late at night. The caffeine will keep you awake.

### Simple Recipes and Ideas to Enjoy Matcha Daily

You can drink matcha in many ways. Not just tea. Put it in smoothies. Make a matcha latte. Add it to your food. But do not add sugar. Sugar is bad for weight loss.

Potential Downsides and Who Should Be Cautious
----------------------------------------------

Matcha is good but also has some bad things. I will tell you about them.

Caffeine can be a problem. Some people are sensitive. Matcha might have lead. So, buy good matcha. It can upset your stomach too. If you are pregnant or sick, ask your doctor. This is important.

Conclusion: Is Matcha a Magic Bullet for Weight Loss?
-----------------------------------------------------

Matcha can help you lose weight. It can help you burn fat. It can help you not feel hungry. And it gives you energy. But it is not a magic tool. It cannot do everything. You must also eat good food. And you must exercise. Then, matcha can help you lose weight the right way.

Call to Action: Encourage Readers to Try Incorporating High-Quality Matcha Into Their Healthy Lifestyle and Consult a Healthcare Professional if They Have Concerns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try matcha. Put good matcha in your life. But remember the other things. Eat well. Move your body. If you have worries, talk to a doctor. They can tell you what is right for you. Matcha is good, but it is not the only thing. Be smart. Be healthy.

First thing in the morning I’m just sipping that coffee and getting the dog to go out for a walk. I look at the Spotify screen – a new recommendation. A big sigh because Spotify recommendations are either suggested by a group of people on LSD camping in Madagascar or an AI that hasn’t got a clue about music yet.

For example it wasn’t long ago when after any song ­-- the next on the playlist would be a Thrown song. Andre Riu, Cliff Richards or Dolly Parton? It didn’t matter Spotify wanted me to get Thrown in my system. Turn up full whack at the gym and break your PR’s on anything, seriously, Thrown is better than pre-workout. 

Today it recommended a band by the name of Knives with an album by the name of glitter. They’re from around my parts. Bristol – nice, let’s go.

Man, I had such a good time with this album. I think the dog lost weight. I was even two-stepping around these streets which judging that the population around here is mostly retired people it looked odd. My sausage dog doing four-stepping if I did not know better I would have said he was liking the music too. 

The album gets off to a great start. Some spoken lyrics, two different voices so there seems to be some sharing duties with the vocals. And there are dissonant guitars and there are breakdowns. Then  in kicks  the third song (don't ask about the second, it went too fast)  and there is clearly a lot of noise elements – some winds even, some hardcore influences and the mix is refreshing as it is invigorating.

The songs go by quickly; the tempo is high, the energy is contagious and I’m at the end of the album and I always end up with a favorite song but this time it was tough to choose. 

I decided to go with: You Think You Know – Track No 10. This is going to the radios over here pretty quick if it isn’t already.

And no negatives? Well remember this is a cycle of threads by the name of Recommendation ---Not Review. 

The aim here is about listening and sharing what one think. So go and listen to it and if you want to talk about it we will do.

What started as a recognition that, although egalitarian thinking among today's Western marriages is prevalent, there is a segment of the male population that believes women are second-class citizens, became a way to operate in her day-to-day life. 

Why do we have this chasm between men and women? There are any number of explanations—that in caveman times, men hunted and women gathered; that in the mid-twentieth century, men worked outside the home and women were homemakers; and yet today, women still earn less money, are objectified, and somehow are ""pushed down"" by the patriarchy.

It's not uncommon to hear some women retell stories of being propositioned during job interviews, whistled at, or treated differently at restaurants because women stereotypically tip less than men. I once heard a wealthy lady complain that she gets the less desirable tee times at the country club. Just consider movies and music, and you'll be hard-pressed not to see and hear a heavy focus on women's beauty.

To hear my niece Jean's worldview, and I'm exaggerating to make a point—that women were and are born into a society where they need to wear makeup, get their breasts enlarged, be thin, wear high heels, work as flight attendants or nurses, or waitresses, and have limited access to captains of industry and other leadership roles.

In summary, my heterosexual niece Jen is pro-women in everything now. From having a majority of lesbian friends to reading a lot of feminist authors, accepting weight gain as a protest against society's pressure to have a slim physique, listening to mostly female musical artists, and so on.

By the way, I am a liberal-thinking old man. But I pose the question to women: What are your thoughts on the patriarchy? Do you believe you've been pushed down by a world operated primarily by men? Do you hate the male gender? By the way, I am a liberal-thinking old man that brings my wife coffee in bed every morning.

Fortunately I don't smell bad (or at least there's around me who my ask are lying) and I shower regularly. I recognize foods that make me sweat more, like sugar and coffee, and while I'm certainly a sweaty person, avoiding those seem to help me get by well enough. 

This past year my underarm sweat has been getting considerably worse and I decided I should finally try using a antiperspirant because I'm tired of changing my shirt two or three times a day. After doing some research on Reddit and around the internet, I found that using antiperspirant deodorant with aluminum in it seems to be not as big a deal as I previously feared, and in a moment of haste I decided to purchase a stick of Mitchum, roll on, 48 hour protection. It was inexpensive and if I wanted to try something more natural and expensive, I can do that later.

Following the directions, i took a shower, dried my armpits and applied it at night. The next morning I drank a cup of coffee and noticed that my armpits were actually dry. Woohoo!

Day three or four after first and only application, my armpits began to feel itchy, but there was no visible rash and itchiness really wasn't that annoying, but just unique and made me feel curious if the deodorant caused it. Still 90% less sweat.

The itchiness continued until day 6 or 7 when it gradually subsided, still 90% less sweat. 

I'm now on day 14 after applying the deodorant for the first and only time and still, 90% less sweat my armpits. I'm sweating everywhere else as I normally do, but my armpits are comparatively dry. Wtf?!

Ive take showers nearly every day and have scrub my armpits with soap and a washcloth, especially during the itchy period when I was concerned I could end up getting a rash or something. 

Is this normal?? I mean, I thought I would have to apply the deodorant on a regular basis, but I'm concerned that there could be something else going on and I've just never heard of an antiperspirant deodorant with an effectiveness range of 2 weeks or more.

1kmfnnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GossipHarbor/comments/1kmfnnc/do_not_spend_any_money_in_this_game_heres_why/,Do NOT spend any money in this game. Here's why:,"When you realise that a Level 10 item requires *1000* energy, you understand that this game is set up to bleed you dry, literally no other reason. 

Of course that should also have been obvious from the fact that it's no ads. Their only revenue is the players. So of course they make it as addictive as possible. 

I haven't spent a cent on the game and here's why. 

In one of the ""challenges"", you have to make:
- bread 
- then pot of tea
- then sandwich
And your prize for doing it faster than the bot? One item of bread that you literally gave up to compete in the first place. 

Not to mention the fact of making two distinct chains come out of one generator, and having literally no control over the production rate. A fancy teapot, Level 7, is ""only"" 256 energy but to get it you have to burn ~1000-2000 in coffee. 

Oh and the developers clearly know they are running a total scam. How? Well so many times, I'm building a teapot, or a plate of waffles. I.e. needing the ""secondary"" chain that the generator gives out in limited supply. So I've burned 200 energy just to get 30 potatoes, *almost* enough for the waffles. But then what - the game gifts you the waffles, *only* once you've already burned all the energy building the chains. The gift is *purely* a slap in the face disguised as a benefit. I can only imagine the pure laughter the Devs had when they came up with that idea. 

Do not waste any money at all on this scam game. It will never give you the satisfaction. Better off buying beer or wine and a gym set to work it off. 

[Edit]
More examples: 
- you can never finish the taco board, or the dinosaurs, or the bees and flowers, *unless* you spend money to accelerate your progress.

And you finish the sets in strictly perfect order - meaning, the reception of the cards is not random, it's precisely programmed. They *decided* to make you need 1000+ cards to complete the series of 135.

Success doesn’t just happen overnight.

If you’ve ever wondered how high achievers seem to be so consistent, productive, and focused—**it all starts with their mornings.**

From CEOs and entrepreneurs to athletes and creatives, highly successful people around the world swear by **powerful morning routines** that shape their mindset, energy, and goals for the day.

In this blog post, you’ll discover:

* Why your morning routine plays a major role in your success
* 10+ powerful habits successful people practice daily
* How to build a morning routine—even if you’re not a morning person
* Bonus tips, tools, and real-life examples to inspire you

Ready to take control of your day—before your day takes control of you? Let’s go! 💪

# 🧠 Why Your Morning Habits Matter More Than You Think

Your morning sets the **tone, energy, and mindset** for everything that follows. If you start your day feeling rushed, scattered, or stressed, you're more likely to:

* React instead of act
* Lose focus
* Waste precious time and energy

But when you begin your day **with clarity and purpose**, you take back control. You think better, work better, and feel better.

**Successful people know this.** They don’t just roll out of bed and “wing it.” They have a plan. A rhythm. A system.

>

# 🔟+ Morning Habits of Highly Successful People

Here’s a deep dive into the most impactful habits that high achievers use to jump-start their days.

# 1. ⏰ Wake Up Early (But With Purpose)

Most successful people wake up before the world gets noisy—often between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM.

Why?

* It gives you quiet, focused time
* You can work on your goals before daily distractions kick in
* Early mornings are linked to improved mental health and discipline

**Tip:** You don’t have to wake up at 4:00 AM. The goal is to wake up **early enough to own your morning**—not rush into it.

# 2. 🙏 Practice Gratitude, Prayer, or Meditation

Gratitude is a mindset superpower. When you start your day by focusing on what’s good, your brain becomes more positive and focused.

**Try this:**

* List 3 things you’re thankful for
* Say a short prayer or affirmation
* Meditate for 5–10 minutes using an app like Calm or Headspace

**Bonus:** These habits reduce anxiety, increase emotional strength, and help you stay grounded during tough days.

# 3. 💧 Rehydrate Immediately

After a night of sleep, your body is naturally dehydrated. That dehydration affects your energy, mood, and concentration.

**Pro tip:** Drink a full glass of water within 10 minutes of waking up—before coffee or tea. You’ll feel more alert and energized.

Some successful people add lemon, sea salt, or apple cider vinegar to boost metabolism and digestion.

# 4. 📖 Feed Your Mind (Before the World Fills It)

High performers **start the day with inspiration, not notifications**.

Instead of checking social media, try:

* Reading 5–10 pages of a personal development book
* Listening to an uplifting podcast
* Watching a motivational video on YouTube
* Reading a daily devotional

This sharpens your focus and gives you mental momentum before distractions hit.

# 5. 📝 Journal or Set Daily Goals

Writing in the morning helps you:

* Clear mental clutter
* Stay focused on what truly matters
* Track your growth and mindset

Many successful people write down:

* Top 3 tasks for the day
* Intentions or goals
* Affirmations like “I am focused and productive”
* A quick gratitude list

Even 5 minutes of journaling can set the tone for clarity and purpose.

# 6. 🧘 Move Your Body (Even Just a Little)

You don’t need a full gym workout. Just **get your body moving**.

Exercise in the morning:

* Increases blood flow and oxygen to your brain
* Boosts mood through dopamine and endorphins
* Builds self-discipline

**Options:**

* 10-minute yoga stretch
* Quick walk or jog
* Dance to your favorite song
* Bodyweight workout at home

Successful people often prioritize fitness—not just for health, but for mental clarity and energy.

# 7. 🍽 Eat a Balanced, Healthy Breakfast

Breakfast literally means **“break the fast.”**

Your brain and body need fuel—so don’t skip it.

**Healthy breakfast ideas:**

* Protein smoothie with fruits and greens
* Oatmeal with nuts and berries
* Eggs, avocado, and whole grain toast

Avoid sugary cereals or pastries that cause energy crashes later.

# 8. 🚫 Avoid Your Phone First Thing

Successful people protect their **focus and energy** in the morning.

The worst thing you can do? Check social media or emails the moment you wake up. It puts your brain in reactive mode.

**Instead:**

* Keep your phone on “Do Not Disturb”
* Avoid notifications for at least 30–60 minutes
* Use your morning to feed your mind, not your feed

# 9. 💭 Visualize Your Ideal Day

Visualization isn’t woo-woo—it’s a powerful mental tool used by Olympic athletes, CEOs, and top performers.

**Try this:**  
Close your eyes and imagine yourself:

* Completing your tasks with ease
* Speaking with confidence
* Feeling calm and in control
* Ending the day proud and satisfied

Your brain starts to believe what you repeatedly visualize.

# 10. 🧘 Do Something That Centers You

Success isn't just about doing—it’s also about **being**.

Spend 5–10 minutes doing something that **connects you to your purpose** or **brings inner peace**:

* Prayer or worship
* Meditation or breathing
* Journaling your thoughts
* Watching the sunrise
* Reading scripture or inspirational content

This habit helps you stay balanced and emotionally resilient.

# 🕒 Sample Morning Routine for Success (45–60 Minutes)

|6:00 AM|Wake up + drink water|
|6:05 AM|Stretch or light workout|

# ✨ Final Thoughts

Your success is not just about how you **end** your day—it's about how you **start** it.

Morning habits are the secret routines behind the achievements of many great people. You don’t need a 3-hour “millionaire routine”—you just need consistency, clarity, and commitment.

>

Because when you master your mornings, you master your life. 🌅

1kmfgd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHBookClub/comments/1kmfgd2/the_days_of_morisaki_bookstore_by_satoshi_yagisawa/,"The Days of Morisaki Bookstore, by Satoshi Yagisawa","I don’t dislike the book entirely. It’s possible I’m just not the target audience of this book. Or of this new genre *healing fiction*. Nevertheless, I find it unfair to the author and to the readers, this notion of “target audience,” because it’s such an oversimplification of the relationship between writer and reader. It’s reductive, as if sales and capitalism is what drives literature.

The characters are bland, and while not despicable, they’re not totally likeable. You won’t root for them.

I blame it on the prose. The writing is just so bad. Perhaps it’s the translation? Perhaps there’s Japanese sentiments that just don’t have an exact or close enough translation in English, and that’s why it comes off as bad writing?

Is it bad to expect sentences that sing off the page? That you’d delight in reading over and over? Is that too much an expectation? 

Consider these beautiful passages from the book:

>!*It’s only in secondhand books that you can savor encounters like this, connections that transcend time.*!<

and

>!*I realized how precious a chance I*’*d been given, to be a part of that little place, where you can feel the quiet flow of time.*!<

But then they’d be ruined by sappy, overly sentimental, bewildering sentences like:

>!*You reach out your hand and the books are right there. Isn*’*t that wonderful?*!<

>!*Didn*’*t I see that his heart had been crying out for far longer than mine had?*!<

Cringe.

There’s prose that manipulates the reader into a reaction: >!*He*’*d spent the whole time off in the shadows thinking to himself how wonderful she was. That might sound weird, but you could also see it as innocent.*!<

Then there’s the bewildering similes that makes no zoological sense:

>!*indecisive like a jellyfish*!<

>!*his face turned all red like an octopus*!<

And there’s also: >!*When I called her at lunch from the office, Momoko would act like a new bride, always asking,* “*What do you feel like eating today?""*!<

I kid you not. I actually googled if >!jellyfish have a hard time making decisions if they do at all, if all octopi are red, and if new Japanese brides are always thinking of food.!<

There are good sentences. Unfortunately, they are few and far between. And bad prose, littered with so many unnecessary adverbs, ruins the overall effect. The writing feels amateurish, like a first-timer on Wattpad.

Here’s a good sentence: >!*If I*’*d never gone to the shop, I*’*d still be living my life in a daze. I met so many people there, and I learned so many things, and, of course, there were all of the books I discovered. I feel like I finally learned to see something a tiny bit valuable within myself.*!<But then it is ruined by: >!*Although this was the first time I*’*d ever really spoken to him, the words came pouring out of my mouth with such force I couldn*’*t help myself. Wada nodded along as he listened with a look of admiration on his face.*!<

Cringey, cringey writing. But then again, maybe I am not the target audience of this new bestselling craze of Japanese and Korean literature, this new genre? Still, I love Japan. It’s one of the countries I can’t wait to revisit. I love the culture, the food, the people.

What I did like is the plot. The temperament is just so. Plot-wise it’s like an episode from the Netflix series *Midnight Diner*. I thought maybe this story is better on screen than on the page. Apparently, there is a screen adaptation, and watching the trailer, it does look good. Sana screenplay na lang siya, hindi nobela.

I started reading the book as I was lined up to vote during the recent senatorial elections. I forced myself to finish the book because people kept saying they were able to read it in one sitting (it took me a few days to finish because the prose is just terrible), and that it helped them get over their reading slump. I mean, if non-readers or those on a slump enjoyed this, how can I not? Perhaps sila ang “target audience” ng book na ito, ng genre na ito?

The last three chapters are worth slogging through the bad writing. The resolution was acceptable, nothing forced or contrived. Pangit lang talaga pagkakasulat nung most of the book. Gomen nasai, Yagisawa-san.

OK, heto naman what I loved about the book: it made me miss Japan so much. Also, I want to visit Jombucho! I want to walk those streets. I want to bow to bookshop owners. I want to sit in a cafe on a rainy afternoon with a hot cup of coffee.

And I admired how much the Japanese readers read their own authors. Mas marami pa akong nabasang foreign authors, I now admit, than Filipino writers. Maybe I should change that about me. That Yagisawa has an obvious and irrepressible love for Japanese literature is evident on every page of this book. And as far as the love for books is concerned, well, target audience ako doon ng book na ito.",1,1747230047.0,PHBookClub,0,1.0,False

I've tried quitting caffeine cold turkey around 3 times. While I've managed to endure the withdrawal symptoms and stay off coffee for 60-90 days each time, I inevitably slide back into my 2-espresso-a-day habit. The worst part? The first 2 weeks of cold turkey quitting leaves me essentially useless and lazy. This time I'm trying something different, a gradual long-term-ish taper inspired by another user (can't remember the handle).

**The Strategy** 

I've prepared 40 plastic cups (see photo), each containing a pre-measured coffee mixture. I've distributed caffeinated coffee across these cups with gradually decreasing amounts, while increasing the decaf portion to maintain the same volume. Each day I'll consume one cup, working through them in sequence. By day 40, I should be almost entirely caffeine-free, hopefully without the brutal withdrawal symptoms and saving my body and mind some unnecesary stress. Also, this way I won't have to think anything, I'll just take the cup for that day and be done.

Hoping this methodical approach finally helps me break free from caffeine without the usual two weeks of brain fog and misery. Has anyone tried a similar taper method before? Curious about your experiences!",2,1747230023.0,decaf,4,0.67,False

The reason why I'm asking is because I'm unsure whether this works in terms of our ""Prep Area"". In this layout, I'd theoretically have to:

1. Take food out of the fridge
2. 'Cross' the coffee station to the sink
3. Wash/Prep
4. Move to the island for cooking

*Not exactly a problem per se; Simply wondering if there's a better option that we're failing to see here in terms of workflow*

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

As the sun started peeking through, the light hit this old pot of succulents just right. It was one of those moments where everything seemed kinda ethereal, like the plants were glowing and reaching out to each other. 

In that short moment, it made me ponder about how everything around us is connected in ways we often don't notice—how we, like those plants, share this invisible web with people and things around us, even if we aren't actively aware of it. I kinda realized that our actions, no matter how small, ripple out and touch those connections in surprising ways.

It's weird how a simple gaze made me appreciate the subtle, often-hidden ties between us all. Not gonna lie—it was a nice, warm feeling to start the day. 😊",2,1747229706.0,NormaldayEpiphanies,0,1.0,False

You may want to sit down or hold you heart if I end up giving you butterflies ;)

So bear with me because this is going to be a long ride buttttt dear future husband if you can't even put this much effort to know me isn't it unfair :/


First things first , the bio data 🙄

5'4 (yeah yeah I know I'm not that tall 😔 buttttt I won't mind if you're tall though what's a kiss if you don't have to tiptoe for it)

Built: Like a Aphrodite statue (yeah Roman men would've gone to war for that but I get body shamed by aunties -_-)
And yeah I do strength workout to keep it that way so if you're looking for a skinny girl, best of luck <3 You can stop reading now!
But if a soft girl's your thingy continue on!!!

And yeah I'm pretty maybe not the

سنا ہے لوگ اسے آنکھ بھر کے دیکھتے ہیں
سو اس کے شہر میں کچھ دن ٹھہر کے دیکھتے ہیں

Way, because if someone random is staring at me ankh bharkay there's bound to be some larai because Han Bhai apko masla Kia hai??!!

But definitely in the :

“Come with me, Milena. We are going to love each other without scruples or fear or restraint. Because the world is ending tomorrow.”
(Definitely after marriage though , not looking for an affair)

Oh also ethnicity: Punjabi


What else goes here?!!!
Oh yeah what I'm doing with my life: I'm in medicine

I guess now let's come to the personality and stuff

From the 16 personality test thing, I'm an INFP
And I'm an introvert who does love to communicate but only with selective people , crowds can be a bit daunting for me at times but alone?!!! You're going to want me to shut up and quite yapping because boi o boi if I am comfortable with the person I'm going to talk to them about each and everything! (And oh yeah I do know a looooooots of stuff )

Religion:
Super important to align on this stuff
So I am someone likes to learn about religion on my own too because I believe as an adult Muslim it's important for us to learn about Islam and differentiate between culture and religion.
Also I'm a hijabi (so I'll be willing to exchange pictures after asking initial deal breakers in 6-7 messages but they'll be obviously in hijaab)
For now the hijaabless version of me is reserved for the all women gatherings only :/
The prayers and Quran is important for me also I think obviously staying away from haram stuff too !!!

Okay now continuing
I'm an elder sibling so that means I'm Responsible for a lot of stuff and that taught me to be resilient and get things done from a super early age!!! So if you're looking for someone reliable to do anything, you know who to call?!
Oh wait you don't because you don't have my number duh!!

Now onto interests and stuff (okay this one is going to take a while because while reading this I realised I do love a lot of stuff :/)
I love to romanticise life and view everyday stuff with rose tinted glasses like taking pictures with my camera of around the city and things around me so they look like postcards soldiers could send back home!
(Doesn't mean I'm not realistic though 😭 unfortunately I'm super responsible and get stuff kind of person too)
I love to do stuff for my loved ones (act of service and giving gifts is one of the way I show them love ) and I love love long walks too !!! So dear future husband hit me up if you're up for that 👉🏻👈🏻

I love old songs in both English and Urdu Hindi (the ones you can slow dance in kitchen's dim light in and the one where you put Motia in your wife's hair and take in the dim sunshine)
Anddddd also Punjabi songs, and banger dance songs (I dance along to them in my room alone when I'm upset)

Okay now brace yourself because for such a lover girl my taste in media might not match that, for books and movies I loveeeeee crime and thrillers !!!!! (Yeah not afraid of gore at all) if it's a mystery series date count me in and after that we can slow dance to Frank Sinatra too!!
And I'm very interested in fashion and design and often design and stitch elaborate dresses , or revamp my brother's wardrobe

(Also I'm good at haggling y'all!!! Bhai 3000 ki pant 500 main dedo type) see what a catch I am!!!

And I do have lots and lots of other hobbies too but I guess let's leave something for the Dms,
And obviously I know how to cook duh
(I can cook super fancy stuff while you do the dishes though that's part of the deal ;))

(Including 🤓 : stealing books and stuff online , because damn I ain't paying these greedy corporates anything)


Requirements:
Super clear here that I'm looking for a man near to my age so obviously at this early stage of his career he won't have his own house or so much money either (so that's not my requirement) but being hardworking and working towards a better future is important to me

Age: 22-27 (uhh maybe 28? )

Height : 5'10 and above ( agar ap 6 feet tou ziada behtar 👉🏻👈🏻) due to the reason mentioned above

Job / profession: Idk dude just be educated and have willingness and drive to move forward
( Med / engineering / CA bla bla or any other as I said should be educated and wanting to move ahead and hardworking !!!)

Religiosly : should be similar to what I listed about (should not be indulging in any haram stuff such as alcohol, sexual relationships (I have not done any such thing ever ) so it's fair for me to demand same from my future spouse)

Personality:
I really need my man to be good at communication, because this is literally supposed to be your closest relationship in life so how you're supposed to be companions without willingness to open to each other !
I'm super supportive person so I'll want the guy to be okay with sharing his sorrows with me I don't believe in the whole guys don't cry thing!!! , You're having a bad day????!!! It's okay come home and I'll make a great cup of chai or coffee and you can vent and cry!!!
No anger issues please , I sob if anyone raises their voice at me (okay fine doesn't go with my damn I'm gonna ki--ll you Vibe I had above but it is what it is)
oh yeah also I'll want someone who'll want to build the relationship on love and trust and mutual efforts!!! ( And no efforts don't equal spending money only) like random notes or flowers here or there or making coffee for me sometimes
Sitting on the counter while I bake some cookies for you [and obviously you do the dishes (pls pls pls)]
And someone who'd respect me as a person and not make those wife hating jokes in gatherings!!!

(I am literally a super super hopeless romantic and I handwrite letters for my friends so please please be romantic too [after the shaaaadi])

Timeline : would want to involve families as soon as we align

Then she proposed to me a few weeks later (Jan 2017).  Broke up with me when I refused, told me to never contact her again unless I married her, she cried really hard.  She did this several times till she said it was the final time.  She regret it a few days later and asked to get back with me.  But I didn't know what to do.  Would it just end with her getting even more hurt and crying in my bed for hours again?

However, my mother had issues with her.  She only started dating me in December and told me I didn't love her because I didn't get her Christmas presents.  Which I ended up doing because I felt inadequate and wanted to make her happy.  The other was the marriage thing and talking about moving out with me.

I am assuming she felt if she did this I would also cave and marry her?  But the issue was I think she was previously engaged and ""in love"" with someone just 3 months prior, which made me believe she didn't truly love me.

However, when I got in touch with her again after over 3 years.  She was very apprehensive at first and hurt.  It seems she immediately wanted to get back together.  But I told her I would need time to be ready for marriage, she said it was okay.

Then her new ultimatums were about me not telling my mom we were not back together.  It was a mistake, but it was 2020, covid and my mom was deathly afraid of it, it was difficult to bring someone over that she disliked and what felt like was endangering her life.  She didn't like that I was secretly seeing her but I told her I'd eventually tell my mom.

Now the issue came is she told me she cheated on me and then started asking for an open relationship repeatedly.  She also stormed out of the airbnb a second time without saying a word to me.  I tolerated it for awhile but I broke up with her.  When I did this again she begged me not to do it said she lied and made it up to get leverage and for us to go back to normal.

She told me she wanted to remain friends.  We talked sporadically.

A year later she told me it was my fault for not telling my mom and for not wanting to marry her.  Told me I was a liar.

A year after that she told me I was ugly.  When I tried reaching out.

A year after that (present day) she reached out but later deleted her messages.  But then blocked me everywhere.

I think she has some sort of anxious attachment.  Thinking back in High School she used to approach me and tell me ""I love you"" and she wouldn't let me leave till I said it back to her (2007ish).  I first took her out  in 2013 for coffee however she was always turning me down every few months when I tried asking her out.

This lightweight stroller lives up to its reputation as one of the top-rated convenience options on the market. It’s easy to see why parents everywhere rave about its compact design, sturdy frame, and thoughtful features. But like every product, there are highs and lows that deserve a deeper look.

**Design: Sleek, Sturdy, and Practical**  
The first thing I noticed about this stroller was its sleek black aluminum frame. The durable yet lightweight design makes it incredibly easy to maneuver; weighing only 13 pounds, I could carry it upstairs one-handed while holding a shopping bag in the other. The compact fold and carry strap have also been game-changers for storage—it fits neatly in the trunk of my mid-sized car. Its minimalist design doesn’t compromise practicality, and the adjustable canopy with a flip-out sun visor offers great protection on those glaringly sunny days.

**Comfortable for Babies and Toddlers**  
My niece, who often tests it with me, seems to adore the large seat area. The four-position recline feature has been a lifesaver, especially during nap times during outings. The five-point safety harness adjusts seamlessly and gives me reassurance, knowing she’s secured. For taller toddlers, the generous recommended weight capacity of 50 pounds accommodates them with no problem. I’d say the comfort level for children is impressive, which is something many parents might want to prioritize.  

**Upsides**  
- Compact, foldable design with auto-lock for ultimate portability.  
- Aluminum frame—it’s light but doesn’t skimp on sturdiness.  
- Adjustable sun canopy with extra flip-out visor for UV protection.  
- Spacious undercarriage basket for multiple items, aiding storage needs.  

**Performance: Smooth Rides, Mostly**  
Performance-wise, the suspension system, with anti-shock front wheels and lockable rear wheels, makes a difference. It navigates smoothly on pavement and does decently on grass and compact dirt trails. However, on cobblestones or uneven surfaces, the ride isn’t as smooth, and adjustments were needed. While managing tighter street corners or crowded shopping aisles, it turned on a dime, which is something I truly appreciated!  

Check **[Summer Infant 21930A 3Dlite Convenience Stroller](https://babycareshop.com/p/b00o20ocvc/)** deals on Amazon now.

**Storage Features that Save the Day**  
The extra-large storage basket genuinely feels like a parent’s blessing. I managed to fit a small diaper bag, some groceries, and even my coffee thermos without maxing out its 10-pound capacity. The added rear pocket is perfect for delicate essentials like my phone or wallet. There’s even a cup holder! Though I confess, my reusable bottle was too large for it, a standard disposable cup sits securely.

**Negatives**  
- Struggles with cobblestone surfaces or uneven terrain.  
- The cup holder doesn’t fit larger reusable bottles.  

**Competitors**  
While I was considering my purchase, I looked at the UPPAbaby Minu and Maclaren Quest. Both have compact designs, but the UPPAbaby was significantly more expensive, and the Maclaren, though sleek, lacked some storage perks this stroller offers. The Summer Infant stroller shines in value, giving you a sturdy, lightweight option without breaking the bank. However, the ride smoothness on uneven surfaces is where some higher-end competitors still excel.

**Affordable Quality that Fits the Bill**  
When comparing cost-effectiveness, it’s clear that this stroller offers significant bang for the buck. With its blend of features like a reclining seat, storage, and portability compared to pricier alternatives, I found it to be a fantastic investment. Paying more for another stroller might get you enhanced materials or a customizable aesthetic, but for basic everyday functionality, this stroller holds its ground commendably.

There is divine influence through spiritual discipline

Peace follows practice, our routines either draw us closer to God or dull our awareness of His presence.

Practice daily praise, praise shifts perspective and brings God’s presence.

Internal peace is mental and spiritual calmness that exists within a person, regardless of external circumstances. It’s an attitude or mindset toward personal challenges and current troubles.

External peace refers to peace in relationships; how we interact with others and maintain harmony.

When internal peace is shaken, it often disrupts how we handle relationships. Conversely, relational conflict can deeply impact our inner calm.

The enemy uses this connection strategically. If he can't reach a person’s inner peace directly, he may target their relationships, which in turn undermines internal peace.

for a while now i ditched all music and streaming services and went back to traditional radiostations and cable TV (sort of) more likely iptv and online radio. its kind of the same thing...and its also way cheaper...like i can get most online radio stations for free and i also get most normal tv stations for free over iptv with apps like pluto or Joyn.  so right now i pay absolutely nothing for tv and music. 

and you know what? i absolutely love it.

i grew up in the 90s/2000s, i am used to it. its freeing my head up like crazy because i dont have to doomscroll streaming services or spotify playlists anymore, trying to find anything i want to watch. i just have a few tv and radio stations setup for various genres like comedy central or a freetv station for old scifi shows like star trek and whatnot. and all i have to chose is: what kind of stuff do i want to watch or listen to...and then put on a station and roll with it in the background. sometimes there are really cool shows and movies that i would never watch otherwise and shows that you wont even get on streaming services, like documentations or more like hobby related shows like gardening or whatnot. 

and if nothing good is on air right now... i just turn it off and do something else. just like you would have in the 2000s 

and call me really crazy but: i dont even mind the ads. its relatively moderate... i dont get bombarded with ads but if an ad is playing here and there... i dont even mind it. actually the opposite. its weird but:

i start to appretiate ads because they pull me out of the movie or show for 2-3 minutes giving me clear breakes every 30minutes or so. they kind of prevent me from binge watching as a... sort of... ''anti-addiction mechanism'' they force me to stand up, do some stuff within a break, hit the toilet, grab a coffee... they detach me from the tv show just enough that i dont get lost in it, while i can still enjoy a show thats on it. 

and just pulling up iptv, putting on comedy central and watching like 2 episodes of futurama and then move on with my day is just so much more enjoyable to me right now than netflix or other streaming services have been for YEARS. 

the most fun and enjoyment i got from movies or music in my life...was from an era were streaming did not even exist. so its not even a drawback to have iptv and buy some tv shows or movies on dvd you wanna watch all the time. ",10,1747229413.0,Zillennials,2,1.0,False

🍲 Foodie & Mishti Maker I have a love for good food, especially Indian sweets like mishti doi and gulab jamun. I also enjoy making mishti at home.

⏳ Timekeeper & Knife Enthusiast I appreciate fine wristwatches and knives—there’s elegance in craftsmanship. Lately, I’ve been drawn to titanium machined ballpoint pens too.

📚 Semi-Retired & Book Café Owner I’m semi-retired and run a cozy little book café. It’s a space where good conversations, the smell of fresh coffee, and stories come together—a perfect place to meet fellow book lovers.

💬 Journaling & Meaningful Conversations I’m always up for deep conversations—be it life, travel, history, or exchanging stories. I’m also a proud father to my son, Govind.

If this resonates with you, drop me a message. We can start with emails or handwritten letters—I believe there’s something truly special about that.

Looking forward to a good conversation!

Due to space limitations in my apartment kitchen, I’m thinking of placing the grinder next to my air fryer—it’s really the only practical spot available. I also plan to frame some of my empty coffee packaging and turn it into a poster, which will free up space on my open shelf. My idea is to place the siphon on the top shelf and the AeroPress in the middle section.

The horizontal shelf seems like a great spot to organize my drippers and scale. I also have a few opened coffee bags that I use daily, so I’m considering placing those either on the bottom shelf or alongside the scale and drippers on the horizontal one.

I've updated Blue Journal with the following:

1. You can now paste images into the notes instead of having to attach photos directly (thanks u/killianmcc for the suggestion)
2. There's a new page to help you solve another puzzle in the game once you draft the billiard room.
3. A more pragmatic approach to enabling various pages, because you should not be tooled to perform a certain function until you need that function (so as to prevent spoilers).
4. Previously I was thinking about adding ads but adsense knocked me back and I kinda hate ads anyway so I took them out. Throw me a dollar on the buy me a coffee link on the settings page if you want (or don't, I can just drink water).

On next launch you should be prompted to update. Your existing data etc should carry across.

Bugs:

The checkboxes in settings take a bit to get working, you might have to check/uncheck more than once to get the things in the navbar to show up. Imma fix it soon.

Future:

Export notes and keep them safe someplace else incase they get lost.

**What the heck is this even?**

I made a simple app to track notes and keep track of things in Blue Prince, and offer assistance to some of the in-game puzzles. It's spoiler conscious, so you enable bits of the app as you need them.

SPJIMR Interview Transcript (Not Mine)

Profile: 9/7/8 GNEM Fresher

CAT: 96.53 %ile

Specialization: Marketing Slot: 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025

ID verified by 9:45

A case study at 10:10am was given the sheets for 20 minutes. The case study was about living with your parents as a mid-20s working individual, pros and cons.

G1 started at 11am

Panel: P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)

Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, BCom graduate, family business)

M1 (me)

M2 (Finance + BM specialization, BCom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)

M3 (Finance specialization, BCom graduation, fresher)

The interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go of tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease, F replied hobbies, and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies, and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual.

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)

Actual questions:

TMAY, but not in your form

F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests, but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more.

Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness.

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question, but the panelist helped her find her flow, and eventually she answered well.

Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had).

Initially, I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones), and I answered well.

M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, the tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info, so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied

M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea about (pardon me for financial illiteracy).

Questions moved back to me, I was asked how a coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some examples of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either).

F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato, which notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc, which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings.

M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket, but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things).

F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented.

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed.

P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one.

Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results.

G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take.

Verdict: The Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of waiting)

It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice, and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at SPJIMR, and such, which was fun.

G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.

My group was F (Finance, Fresher), M1 (me), M2 (Marketing, work experience in Career Launcher)

First question: You're in an elevator with Bill Gates, you have 30 seconds to introduce yourself and tell him why you admire him

I fumbled a bit here and didn't introduce myself, mostly talked about what I like about him.

F took it in the direction of Mahakumbh (was Bill Gates in India for Mahakumbh? Idfk), so we discussed the stampede for a little bit.

M2 gave an example of a Coldplay concert, so the discussion went there. Asked about what the hot news is about Coldplay (Panelists were looking for something specific, none of us had any clue about it)

P1 asked me about my favourite new psychologist, and I didn't remember his name, but I talked about the guy behind social constructivism and the postmodernist movement. They wanted to know far more details about social constructivism, so I went on a monologue for like 5-6mins. Not sure what they thought of it.

Then we were asked our key takeaway from the case study and our stance. That's it.",3,1747228273.0,CATstudy,1,1.0,False

I’m an Indian software engineer, and after years of dreaming about it, I’m finally making it happen—my first international solo trip is locked in! I’m planning a 2-3 month(extend if l like the place) backpacking adventure through Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, starting mid-June 2025.

The plan is to work remotely a few hours a day and spend the rest soaking in culture, nature, and local life. I'm leaning towards slow, mindful travel—hostels, night buses, street food, and a few long stops to just breathe.

My rough itinerary:

Vietnam: Hanoi → Ninh Binh → Da Nang → Hoi An → Ho Chi Minh City

Cambodia: Siem Reap → Phnom Penh → Kampot (if time allows)

Laos: Luang Prabang → Vang Vieng → Nong Khiaw

Thailand:

Chiang Mai (great base for remote work)

Pai (mountain town with a chilled vibe)

Ayutthaya (ancient city close to Bangkok)

Bangkok (street food and city chaos)

Krabi / Ao Nang (for island hopping and beach downtime)

Possibly Koh Lanta or Koh Tao for some peaceful coastal living

This is a big step for me—first time traveling abroad, first time solo, and first time trying the digital nomad lifestyle.

I’d love your tips on:

Offbeat places or must-see stops I’ve missed

Budget travel hacks (especially cross-border transport)

Co-working or work-friendly cafés

SIM cards, safety tips, and travel apps

Visa advice for Indian passport holders

Meeting people / local or expat communities

I’m an experienced Java dev who’s run the gauntlet on both sides of the interview table, and I kept seeing juniors freeze on the same core concepts no matter how many PDFs they read or video tutorials they binged. So I built in my free time something hands-on to bridge the gap: a **50-card deck** plus a matching **printed handbook**, all keyed for **Java 17**.

* **50 sturdy, color-coded flashcards.** Q on one side; concise answer + sometimes tiny code snippet on the back.
* **Printed handbook.** Flip to any 💡 icon for deeper insights, common pitfalls, and extra examples. Each entry matches a card number and its category color.

The intended use is over coffee breaks or even as audio-only drills on the commute - no screen glare, fewer distractions. I believe the testing effect really sticks knowledge in long-term memory.

# A few questions for you:

1. **Topic coverage:** Do these five buckets match what juniors actually get grilled on in interviews?
   * Java Essentials
   * OOP & Design Patterns
   * Data Structures
   * Java API & Libraries
   * Java Best Practices
2. **Deck depth:** Is 50 cards + handbook just right? Too much? Too little?
3. **Formats:** Would you rather DIY with a PDF, grab the physical set, or use both in tandem?

  
I’d be thrilled to send the **full PDF** (all cards + handbook) to anyone who wants to flip through the complete set - just drop a comment or DM. If you prefer a printed copy or want to support my work, you can find the sets on Amazon, Etsy, and eBay (search “Java Interview Guide Junior Flashcards”).

So I got curious and did a little research   
I noticed something interesting: 

“Cappuccino cups” have significantly more search volume than “latte cups.”

However, when looking at actual sales on Etsy, both cappuccino and latte cups sell poorly. For latte cups, that makes sense—low search volume and low sales are expected. But for cappuccino cups, the high interest (in search) paired with low actual sales seems unusual.

I’m based in London and have a big idea for a tech startup that’s got me excited now that i’ve finally finished deconstructing it on paper, it’s way over 100 pages and it took forever to get it done. I’ve been working on this and changing parts back and forth and refining it for a couple years. It’s a bold project I won’t lie, but it comes with a killer plan. I’m looking for 2 UK-based co-founders, ideally based in London also, to join me. I work in construction by day as well as doing some online work for a web3 AI company (just moderator and some admin stuff), but I need a partner with tech (coding, Unity experience a bonus but not needed) and business (pitching, grants) skills to make it into the gold i envision this to become.

The product itself is a web3 based educational “game” but it goes beyond that. Happy to discuss more in person.
Also while i have the idea completely refined and deconstructed, as i am looking for long term partners in this, things will be open to change if you believe we should take a different approach, thats the whole point of us being co-founders. I want us to grind on this together and win together. I know how vital and valuable you are to the success of this and i dont think i’ll ever take that for granted.

I'll kick this off with ""Not all research is valid or applicable""

Coffee ground mulch and tea. Much toted, it's all the rage, run down to Starbucks, snatch up all the used coffee grounds, use some tied up in a cheesecloth to soak in water for 24 hours in the sun to make ""coffee tea"" and drench your peppers in it. Combine this with mulching around the plant with the coffee grounds and all your pest problems, past and present will magically go away. There was even a peer reviewed paper on the validity of coffee tea and mulch in eliminating aphids. I ran down to Starbucks, snatched up all the used coffee grounds I could carry, and lugged them back to the hacienda. I made a huge batch of coffee tea, mulched my pepper plants an inch deep, and waited for the aphids to start keeling over. And waited. And waited. 

Meanwhile, I noticed my aphid population was exploding indoors. The aphids would line up in the morning, tiny Starbucks coffee mugs in hand, waiting for the next serving of coffee tea, while the little aphids were sledding up and down the coffee ground mulch slopes. Maybe I didn't use enough coffee tea and maybe 1"" of grounds wasn't thick enough, so I doubled down, drenched the plants, mulched to 2"" deep, and the result? More aphids. 

  
The coffee grounds turned to a concrete, hydrophobic layer, utterly water repellent, and the plants stunted and did not grow. I removed the coffee grounds, dumped them in the compost (worms love them), and spent 4 months rehabbing stunted, aphid infested pepper plants.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

(World Best Supplement)A Detailed Review,"If you're sitting there wondering whether PrimeBiome is just another overhyped supplement, let me be the one to tell you—this is THE real deal. I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

Pregnant sleep; 
I am still SOOO exhausted. Like first trimester tired and/or worse some days. Barely keeping my eyes open as I WFH. 

I have cut back on caffeine; sadly coffee was one of my first aversions right before I found out. I also don’t drink much pop other than Sprite- it’s all that sounds good. I have a pretty regular sleep schedule and just cannot shake the drowsiness. I thought I heard 2nd trimester was supposed to feel so much better than 1st?? lol 

Any tips? Is it just me? I feel like I can’t sleep enough and obviously working full time I can’t nap all day as needed. 

Baby Sleep;
Starting to make a registry and I am getting a lot of mixed reviews on bassinet (if so how long?), straight to crib day one, cosleep, etc. 

** please don’t start war on this ** 

Also swaddling in sleep- from what I’m reading I DONT think I want to but I want opinions so I don’t get overzealous and so I have more other topics/ideas. 

Just trying to keep my options open as a FTM. I have no clue what I’m doing. I know there is more research to be done but again; so exhausted. Trying to make a registry, do the research on every product and parenting philosophy, planning a nursery, intercepting family questions/comments/recommendations— I am worn the heck out. 

I am exactly 5 months from my due date so I know I have time but trying to not put it off for a day I “feel better” bc what if I never do? Also trying to keep my options open so I don’t get down to the wire and feel even more overwhelmed. ",2,1747227221.0,pregnant,12,1.0,False

I'm getting to know this guy for 4 weeks now. We really matched on the first date and really like each other. At first I thought he was love bombing me, but then I was sure he doesn't. Everything was great. Every date wonderful. But for a few days now he finds problems bordering jealousy. I told him how I was talked to by a ""hongdae boy"" (if you don't know what they are you can Google it) when I visited seoul 2 years ago. They're funny/cringe and I thought I could tell him about this funny thing when I saw an insta reel making fun of it. But he was like ""why would you visit there. It's a party area. He was literally harassing you. How can you be so sure nothing could have happened?"". Firstly I wasn't alone, secondly I felt really safe in seoul because there are many cameras. Then he said ""I would feel so bad when you were at the other end of the world and something like that would happen"". I wasn't in Hongdae to party. I was there for the little shops, basking, restaurant etc. I asked him what the problem would be if I would be there but being in a part of a city here where everyone partys would be okay. He the said ""I don't want to forbid you something. That just doesn't sound safe."". It's okay if he's worried. I told him that IF I would go to such a place again, I would just text a lot so that he knows I'm safe. I'm doing this with my friends and dad too. That's my compromise, but idc what a guy, who I'm not in a relationship with, thinks about me going out. That wasn't enough for him. I'm a woman who is really active and loud if me or others are getting harassed. He knows this. I'm okay. Then yesterday I went to a new physiopraxis. He was mad because I told him I felt safe because my physiotherapist was a younger and not older man. Not because I wouldn't trust an older therapist, but because I had a bad experience with a situation like that. My trauma is gone, but going there was still a big step for me. He know this, but he just saw the ""I like that he's same age as me"". I told him that I'm sorry if I said it in a way that made him think I mean it in a ""the therapist is hot"" way. I just don't get what I should do now. We talked it out and hung up. Today he started with it again and I again told him that I'm sorry that I made him misunderstand, but that there's no way I see a problem in any way. Then he was like ""if I'm so bad, why are you doing it to yourself. Dating me?"". The way he acts like a victim out of nowhere seemed so weird. I told him that I like him and that he wasn't like that before the weekend. I then said that I'm a bit annoyed and want to calm down so we can talk more in the evening. Do you think he's toxic and that it's weird that acts like this without being in a relationship with me? 
Something I also think is important is that he told me that destroyed a coffee table with his fist in a fight with his ex gf. Sounded so scary. Do you think it's okay? Should I keep on dating him?",0,1747227065.0,dating_advice,19,0.5,False

Unable to read a sentence without stopping half-way and re-starting it, not being able to form full sentences when talking, etc.

I'm thinking it might be the coffee. It has crept up to 5+ STRONG cups a day (I even added instant coffee to make it stronger). I'm sure that wasn't the brightest idea, but ""it's just coffee"", right? 

So today I thought ""let's do a day without coffee"". Well.. That sucked! Headache, sweaty hands, massive anxiety, no ability to focus. It became so bad I folded and took a cup of coffee an hour ago. Within 30 minutes I was back with a vengeance.

I understand that moderation can work, basically forever. But I'm gonna cut down to 0 over time, no cold-turkey bs for me. Worked for many things, but this time I'm trying to work while cutting back.

This is a review of the MSC Seascape Cruise I had sailed on on March 15, 2025:

|| || |Mar 15th|Miami, Florida||5:00 PM| |Mar 16th|At Sea||| |Mar 17th|Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic|8:00 AM|5:00 PM| |Mar 18th|San Juan, Puerto Rico|9:00 AM|11:00 PM| |Mar 19th|At Sea||| |Mar 20th|At Sea||| |Mar 21st|Ocean Cay, Bahamas|8:00 AM|8:00 PM| |Mar 22nd|Miami, Florida|7:00 AM|

I've been on 4 cruises so I have a few experiences to compare to.  
I had my reservations about MSC cruises due to the mediocre and sometimes horrible reviews of this company but they had a deal going on during Black Friday and a few of our friends really wanted to go on their first cruise so we decided to book it.

The ship:  
The first impressions with this ship as the staff greet you with song and dance is welcoming and sets the vibe for the cruise! The vibe is positive and the whole ship is grand, beautiful and well maintained. We smoothly boarded around 12pm which took about 20mins. There were already people at the bars drinking and music playing, it was going to be a great week! Through out the cruise, staff was cleaning daily and the ship was spotless. 

We only had one issue with cleanliness where 2 of our guests was hanging out at the Caberet Room for about 3 hrs and left with bug bites all over their legs. They took a photo and showed it to the staff but nothing was really done about it. They since emailed MSC but no response.

The rooms:  
We purchased the Deluxe Balcony suite with an unobstructed view. It's slightly smaller than Celebrity Solstice's Balcony room but not by much. It was very clean and we had no issues during our cruise. One of the first things I do is leave a note for my room attendant to empty the minibar so I can store my own drinks in there like water or food. After all we did have a drink package.

Drinks:  
Speaking of drinks, prior to getting on this ship some reviews mentioned weak, watered down drinks. They were wrong. The bartenders here were all great at their job and were very attentive. We didn't have to wait long for drinks and they were very knowledgeable in cocktails. We had the Easy Plus package which gave us the freedom to get our favourites like: Guinness and all the beers, gin and tonic, martinis, hugo spritz, cabernet sauvignon (which was quite good for their lowest tier wine), and riesling. A bartender named Francisco at the Champagne and Wine bar on deck 7 remembered my name and drink order the first night! He called my name as I walked through the pool deck when he was bartending there during the day. People like Francisco really make you feel good about the service on board.

Food:  
Food reviews of this ship had me feeling like I should only eat the pizza on board but again, they were wrong. Of course I tried the pizza here first which was delicious! Traditional, thin, stone oven baked with fresh ingredients. We ventured to different foods and were impressed by mostly everything. She loves congee and was so surprised to find out that everyday they made congee for breakfast! It was well made too, only 1 day it was too watery. The food our main dining room for dinner was high quality and delicious every time as well. The steaks were cooked to order and done perfectly.

Itinerary:  
It's personal preference but they were only okay. In Puerto Plata, we ended up switching from Taino Bay (which is walking distance from the town) to Amber Cove (15-30mins taxi ride from town) the night before the cruise departed due to there not being enough docks for the cruise lines arriving there that day. This was disappointing because we were looking forward to just walking off the ship and heading into town but from Amber Cove we had to walk out to the road to negotiate an acceptable rate with a taxi driver but we ended up with a great taxi driver who gave us a little tour of the area. We ended up paying $70 plus tip for the round trip and he also took us to the beach instead of the chocolate factory. Puerto Plata is nice but very busy with tourists.

San Juan was our favourite destination. The town was a hop, skip and a step from the port which allowed us to venture off with little worry. There were tourists from our ship plus others living in the town for spring break. It was a good and safe atmosphere in a Spanish influenced town. We found a much less travelled area just North of the main town while trying to find a little restaurant there called La Garita. We tried octopus mofongo which was very very tasty. The gravy was a perfect paring to the mofongo and the octopus was so tender, much like Portugal's octopus. Their pina colada was the best I've ever had.

Ocean Cay was better than okay. A little island with many beaches and very clean. We did our research and found ourselves at Bimini beach and eventually at Lighthouse Beach. Both had nice clean sand and clear ocean water. We didn't see any fish unfortunately with our snokel gear. I do wish they had more information about Ocean Cay to take full advantage of the day. We missed out on iced coconut milk coffee at one of the shops there.

  
All in all we all had a great experience and would book again.

TIP: If you haven't been on MSC but have other cruise loyalty, MSC will match the loyalty level. But you must do this 12months a head of your booking to take advantage of the perks. Otherwise you'll just get a different colour card.",4,1747226223.0,MSCCruises,2,0.75,False

One second I was humming along to my podcast, the next there was a figure in a hoodie pressing cold steel against my ribs. 

I didn’t feel pain, just raw panic, as he barked at me to hand over my purse. My hands shook so hard I dropped everything. He yanked me toward an alley, tore my bag off me, and then he was gone—leaving me curled against a wall, gasping for air.

I pressed my back against the wall and stayed there for twenty minutes, listening to every car engine and creak in the hallway, waiting for a knife to appear.

This morning I dragged myself into the office two hours late, eyes rimmed red. My boss frowned when I slumped into his doorway and mumbled, “Sorry…had a rough night.” He crossed his arms and said, “Again?” I tried to explain the panic attacks, how the garage noise got to me—but he shook his head. “You’ve been here nearly a year now. Maybe find a different route, or just…toughen up?” His tone was almost impatient, like I was choosing to complain.

At lunch, I sat outside by the entrance—too afraid to go back down the stairs. A coworker passed and asked, “You okay? You’ve been off lately.” I nodded and forced a smile. Inside, I was replaying the mugging over and over—the way the knife glinted, the mugger’s voice echoing in my ears. I bit my lip until it bled to stop myself from crying in front of everyone.

The rest of the day was a nightmare. Every time my phone buzzed, my hand flew to my pocket, expecting a threat. Every shadow in the stairwell looked like someone stepping out of the darkness. When I spilled coffee on my shirt, I froze—thinking maybe someone had shoved me into it.

Now I’m home, lights on in every room, curtains wide open, and still I can’t settle. I keep glancing at the front door, waiting for it to burst open. I texted my roommate: “I don’t know if I can do this alone tonight,” and she replied, “Just lock the door and try to sleep.” Like that was any kind of help.

So I’m here, typing this because maybe you know what it’s like to walk through your own apartment as if it were the scene of a crime. Maybe you’ve sat on your couch, hands gripping the cushions, waiting for a memory to drag you back into that alley. Maybe you understand how exhaustion doesn’t come from long days, but from endless nights spent wide awake in terror.

I don’t have answers. I just needed to say it out loud: that mugging didn’t end when he ran off—it’s chasing me into every dark corner, every quiet moment, every breath I try to take. Thanks for listening.

1kme1mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1kme1mn/bloated_tired_and_craving_sugar_this_weird/,"Bloated, tired, and craving sugar? This weird probiotic fixed all three for me","I was constantly bloated, tired by mid-afternoon, and fighting off sugar cravings that didn’t make any sense. Even on days I ate clean, I still felt uncomfortable and foggy. I tried all the usual suspects: probiotics, fiber, more water, fewer carbs - none of it made a lasting difference.

That’s when I came across something called **Akka Superbiotics**. I wasn’t expecting much, but I was curious. It’s not just a probiotic - it also supports **liver function**, which, weirdly, might have been the missing link all along.

**why akka stood out from the rest**

Most probiotics are all about gut bacteria, but **Akka Superbiotics** goes deeper. It includes a strain called **Akkermansia muciniphila**, which isn’t found in typical probiotic supplements. This strain has been studied for how it helps support the **gut lining**, reduce inflammation, and improve how your body handles fat and sugar.

But the real difference? Akka also supports your liver. It contains:

* **Silymarin** from milk thistle (for liver detox)
* **Quercetin** (to reduce inflammation)
* **Resveratrol** (for metabolism and antioxidant support)

It’s a gut and liver combo - and for me, that made a big difference.

You can see the full breakdown here:  
[**Akka Superbiotics complete ingredient list**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-vsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**what i noticed when i started taking it**

I took one capsule every morning before breakfast. I didn’t change anything else in my routine. Here’s how it played out:

**week 1**  
Some slight relief from bloating. Meals felt easier to digest, especially lunch. Less gas and that heavy-stomach feeling started to fade.

**week 2**  
Sugar cravings dropped - and not because I was fighting them. I just didn’t want the usual cookies or snacks in the afternoon. Energy was more stable too. Normally, I need coffee at 3 PM, but I forgot it even existed that week.

**week 3 and beyond**  
My stomach looked flatter. Clothes felt looser. I wasn’t constantly checking my reflection to see if I looked bloated. Best part? My digestion felt *predictable*. That alone felt like a win.

Here's another page that helped me understand why the formula works the way it does:  
[**How Akka supports gut and liver health together**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-tsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&uid=33&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&uid=2376&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**what improved for me**

* **Way less bloating** even after carb-heavy meals
* No more afternoon energy crashes
* Fewer sugar cravings without effort
* Regular digestion with no discomfort
* Better focus during the day

**what didn’t work or could be better**

* It’s not instant - takes a week or two to feel anything
* It costs more than average probiotics
* You need to take it daily for best results

**final takeaway**

If your gut feels off and nothing you’ve tried is giving real relief, **Akka Superbiotics** might be worth exploring. The difference for me wasn’t dramatic overnight, but it was real. It felt like everything inside started working *with* me again instead of against me.

It’s rare that I find a supplement that actually does something noticeable - especially without weird side effects. But this one made me feel more balanced, less reactive, and honestly more like myself.

If anyone else here has tried **Akkermansia muciniphila** or a gut-liver combo supplement, I’d love to hear how it worked for you too.",1,1747226135.0,NaturalHealthFinds,0,1.0,False

OLIVIA'S POV

I lit the last candle, adjusting it slightly to balance the warm glow across the room. Soft music played in the background, and the bedside table was set with Adrian’s favorite wine.

Tonight had to be perfect.

I smoothed the silk lingerie which I had bought just for tonight with my trembling hands as I checked myself in the mirror one last time.

The sound of the door opening downstairs sent a chill down my spine. My heart raced.

Adrian was home.

I hurried to the edge of the bed, holding my cold hands together.

The door to the bedroom swung open, and there he was, he never ceases to take my breath away. His perfect angelic figure filled the doorway, his tie loose and suit wrinkled which was a rare sight for my always composed husband.

“What are you doing in my room?” His cold voice echoed in the room interrupting my thoughts.

I quickly stood up from the edge of the bed and my hands gripped a small portion of the fabric of my silk lingerie suddenly felt ridiculous in the outfit that I'd spent hours picking at the mall.

“I… I thought we could spend some time together,” I stammered.

His gaze swept across the room from the flickering candles, the soft music, the wine and finally landed on me.

His expression hardened and became darker causing me to shiver.

“I didn’t ask for an explanation,” he said coldly. “Blow out the candles and get out.”

I froze, his words hitting harder than they should have.

“Adrian,” I said quietly, forcing a smile that felt fragile. “It’s been a month since you’ve been home. Can’t we just talk for a moment?”

He let out a deep breath, rubbing his forehead as though I were an inconvenience. “I’m tired, Olivia. Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”

“I’ve waited for you for one month!” My voice cracked, and I hated how desperate I sounded. “I thought…”

“I said I’m tired. Are you deaf?” His tone was final and harsh.

I bit back the lump in my throat.

I was in love and this is what love does, it makes you foolish. It makes you endure things you never thought you would.

You might ask me why I married him when I knew this was how he behaved towards me. It would shock you to know that Adrian wasn't always like this.

When we were dating, Adrian was sweet, thoughtful and caring. He made me believe I was the only woman meant for him and I fell for it. I agreed to marry him but the night we got married Adrian changed.

He became cold and distant, he even left me alone in the suites on our wedding night and went off to God knows where. I didn't see my husband until a week later.

No intimacy, no honeymoon, nothing!

I took a shaky breath and decided to try again. “Maybe I can help you relax just like the night before you travelled. We could…”

His dry, cold laugh cut me off. “Help me? Do you think I’d want to have anything to do with you? The last time was a drunken mistake.”

He shook his head. “Stop trying so hard, Olivia. It’s pathetic.”

Drunken mistake? Pathetic?

The words felt like a slap that stung so bad on my cheeks. My fists clenched at my sides as I fought back tears in my eyes.

“Is it pathetic to want my husband to care? To hope that after one month, you might want to be with me tonight?” My voice rose despite the lump in my throat.

He sneered, gesturing to the room. “This…” he waved a hand at the candles, the wine, the silk lingerie.

“This isn’t going to fix anything. It only makes me hate you more. Stop embarrassing yourself.”

My chest tightened. “Hate me?” I whispered, barely able to get the words out.

He sighed, glaring at me. “I think you should stop holding on to something that never existed.”

He once swore that he loved me and now he is saying nothing ever existed?

How could someone who used to love me so much turned into this cold heartless person? I just… I don't get it.

If he claims nothing ever existed between us why then did he marry me?

My chest ached, but I refused to let the tears welled up in my eyes fall.

“For three years you've been hurting my emotions time after time, and you act like you don’t care.”

Adrian scoffed. “Olivia, don’t get me wrong, I’m not acting. I actually don’t care. I never did, and I never will. Get that into your thick, empty skull. Do you understand?”

My breath caught in my throat as I stared at him in disbelief. How could he say such hurtful things to me?

“Then why did you ask for my hand in marriage?” I shouted, my voice shook. “Why marry me, Adrian? Why?”

Adrian’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t answer. Instead, he turned his back at me and headed toward the bathroom.

The door slammed shut behind him, leaving me alone with the flickering candles. Their warm light mocking the effort I had put into this night.

I sank onto the bed, I couldn't hold back the tears anymore as they streamed down my cheeks. My heart ached and I clutched my chest tightly hoping to relieve the pain.

Adrian’s phone buzzed on the nightstand bringing me back from my emotions.

Normally, I wouldn’t touch it. He was always so protective of it. But tonight, something compelled me. Maybe it was the pain, the betrayal, or the small voice in my head telling me not to mind my own business this time.

I picked up the phone, my hands trembled as I read the message.

Dora ❤️: “I enjoyed the vacation with you. Sweet dreams 💋.”

Vacation?

My heart stopped and I was unable to breathe properly for a while.

Adrian had told me he was on a business trip and I'd waited for him for one whole month only to discover that he was with another woman.

The phone slipped from my hands as the truth settled in my chest like a ton of blocks.

Adrian stepped out of the bathroom, a towel draped over his shoulders, I couldn't stop myself. “Who is Dora?”

# CHAPTER 002

OLIVIA'S POV

My body felt heavy as I woke up the next day, the events of last night came flooding back. Adrian’s cruel words echoed in my head like a noise I just couldn't get rid of.

Even after I confronted him about who Dora was he just snatched his phone and left the room without giving me any explanation, leaving me with a broken heart.

But I couldn't conclude yet, Adrian might not really be cheating on me, the text message wasn't enough evidence.

But one thing was certain, I was determined to find out who Dora was.

I sat up slowly, the ache in my chest sharper than ever. I reached for my phone and checked the time. It was 9:30 am.

My heart sank.

I was never one to wake up late, but I guess the emotional hurt I experienced the previous night had clearly drained me.

I gripped the edge of the bed to steady myself. “You're his wife,” I reminded myself. “You made vows. You can’t give up yet.”

I decided to make breakfast for Adrian. I deceived my brain into thinking that if I kept on trying Adrian would one day notice my efforts.

When I stepped into the kitchen, Martha, our housekeeper, was already there, humming softly as she whisked eggs in a bowl.

She looked up when she heard me enter. “Good morning, Mrs. Westwood,” she greeted politely, though concern flickered in her eyes. “You’re up late today. Should I prepare breakfast for you and Mr. Westwood?”

I shook my head. “No, Martha. I’ll handle it.”

Her brows furrowed. “Are you sure? I…”

“I just… I want to do this myself today.” I said softly, cutting her short with a faint smile.

She hesitated but eventually nodded. “All right, ma’am. I’ll be in the garden if you need me.”

I turned to the stove, cooked an omelet, toasted bread, and poured coffee. Maybe Adrian would appreciate the effort, maybe he would see I was trying.

When Adrian appeared, he was already dressed up for work, he didn't even glance at me. He sat at the table, scrolling through his phone as if I weren't there.

I approached cautiously, setting the plate in front of him. “Good morning,” I said, a small smile spread across my face. “I made breakfast.”

He didn’t look up, but his hand reached for the fork. I stood there, watching anxiously as he took a bite.

The moment the food touched his tongue, his expression twisted in disgust. He spat it out into a napkin, glaring at me.

“What is this?” he yelled, pushing the plate away.

“It’s…” My voice trembled. “I thought I’d make you breakfast.”

He stood, grabbing a glass of water and rinsing his mouth. “Don’t bother next time,” he said coldly. “If I wanted to die of food poisoning, I'd let you know.”

I bit my lower lips so hard in a bid to suppress the pain his words caused me.

After speaking, he grabbed his briefcase and strode toward the door without another word.

And I broke down in tears. My tears were the only thing that has been consistent in my marriage.

I heard a footstep approaching and I knew it was Martha. I quickly used the back of my hands to wipe off my tears.

I knew Martha was aware of the situation in my marriage but I still couldn't let her see me cry. I didn't want to receive pity from her, because that would hurt even more.

Martha wore a sympathetic look as she approached. “Mr. Westwood told me to inform you that you should be ready by 7 pm. He’ll pick you up for the gala.”

I nodded, numb. The gala. Of course. That must have been why he came home last night so that we could deceive the world into believing that we were a perfect couple.

It wasn't about me. It was never about me.

The thought crushed me, but I forced myself to remain calm.

By 6:45 pm, I was ready. Staring at myself in the mirror I noticed a slight change in my body but I shrugged it off.

I wore a white gown that hugged my figure. It was Adrian’s favorite color then when we were dating, though I doubted he’d notice it this evening.

When he arrived, he barely glanced at me. “Let’s go,” he said plainly, heading toward the car.

My heart dropped to my stomach, stupid of me to be expecting a compliment.

The ride to the gala was silent, the tension in the air was so thick that I felt suffocated. I was uncomfortable and feeling a bit nauseous.

I needed fresh air so I wound down the car window and stared out, clutching my bag tightly as I tried to calm the storm inside me.

When we arrived, cameras flashed, capturing the image of us as the world's perfect couple.

Adrian stepped out first, extending a hand to help me, acting like a perfect husband for the camera.

What a hypocrite he is!

Everyone never missed a chance to remind me of how lucky I was to marry Adrian.

Lol, only if they knew what I faced in my marriage every day. This is one of the reasons you shouldn't always envy couples who seem sweet on the internet.

Inside, the ballroom glittered with chandeliers and laughter, but I felt invisible. Adrian was the center of attention, charming the guests with his charisma while I trailed behind him like a shadow.

No one acknowledged me. No one asked how I was doing.

It was as if I didn’t exist.

I was about to excuse myself to the ladies’ room when a voice cut through the hum of conversation.

“Adrian!”

I turned toward the source of the voice. She was stunning, her red gown hugged her curves in all the right places. Her radiant smile lit the room and I must admit she looked like she had just stepped out of a magazine.

I won't lie, I felt slightly intimidated.

Adrian’s face lit up in a way I hadn’t seen in three years. “Dora,” he said, his tone warm, almost affectionate.

My breath ceased.

Dora? Could it be the Dora from the text message last night? The one he went on a vacation with?

My heart raced in my chest, I stared at them, my stomach churning.

Adrian didn’t even bother introducing me.

“Adrian,” I said softly, hoping to remind him of my existence.

But he ignored me completely and pretended as if he didn't hear me call out his name.

He leaned closer to Dora and whispered something in her ears, and she laughed, the sound caused a sharp pain in my chest.

She rested her hand on Adrian’s arm in a way that made my blood boil.

“You haven’t changed at all,” she teased. “Still so charming.”

“And you’re as beautiful as ever,” Adrian replied, his smile genuine – a smile I hadn’t seen or had even been directed at me in years.

It was as if a knife had been driven into my chest and was continuously being twisted as I watched them chat.

They chatted like lovers, her hand lingered on his arm, her gaze filled with something possessive.

I stood there, a ghost, as they flirted openly and I couldn't do anything about it. And it hurts.

Dora glanced at me, her lips curling into a sly smirk. “Oh, Adrian, I didn’t realize you had company.”

Huh… She didn't notice? Even a toddler would know I was his company.

I turned towards Adrian hoping to hear his response but his response was like a punch to my face.

“She’s just here for the gala, nothing more,” he said dismissively.

Just here for the gala?

Dora's smirk deepened. “Oh… well, Adrian. Since you don't have any company, why don't we find somewhere quiet to continue our discussion? It’s so noisy here.”

Adrian didn’t hesitate. “That sounds like a good idea.”

I couldn't believe my ears, was he going to leave me here alone?

No, he can't! He knows I don't know anyone here so he might ask me to join them.

Adrian turned to me briefly. “Book a ride home,” he said coldly.

I felt my heart shatter into a million pieces right at that spot.

And with that, he walked away, Dora's hand on his arm, leaving me standing there in the middle of the crowded room where I knew no one.

# CHAPTER 003

OLIVIA'S POV

Adrian didn’t come home that night and I wasn't comfortable since I knew he left with HER. I waited in bed, staring at the clock as hours passed. Midnight approached and still, there was no sign of him.

Was he spending the night with her? Was Adrian really cheating on me?

My chest felt hollow, the silence of the house taunting me. Sleep refused to come, so I sat up, hugging my knees, wondering if I’d ever truly mattered to him.

The next morning, I decided I couldn’t wait around in the house for him anymore. I needed to see him, to talk to him, to get to know who Dora was to him even if it meant facing his anger or indifference.

I didn't care anymore.

I told myself this was my right as his wife, even if he seemed to forget that fact.

I arrived at his office, my heart pounding as I approached the desk of his secretary, a chubby woman named Rita. She looked up from her computer, her expression neutral.

“Good morning, Mrs. Westwood,” she greeted politely, though her tone was quite different.

“I need to see Adrian,” I said, my voice calm despite the storm building inside me.

Rita hesitated, her fingers placed on her keyboard. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but Mr. Westwood has given strict instructions not to be disturbed.”

My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. I could feel the humiliation crawling up my spine. She knew I was his wife, yet she still denied me entry.

This is the humiliation I constantly have to endure ever since I married Adrian.

“Please,” I said, lowering my voice. “It’s important.”

Her lips pressed into a thin line. “I’m afraid I can’t, ma’am. Mr. Westwood doesn’t want to see anyone right now.”

Before I could respond, the door to Adrian’s office swung open. My breathing stopped for a moment as I saw him step out, his deep laugh filling the hallway.

He wasn’t alone.

Walking beside him was Dora, her heels clicking confidently against the marble floor.

What was she doing here?

Adrian’s expression was the same as hers – light, carefree, so unlike the cold mask he wore around me.

I remain rooted to my spot, unsure whether to stay or walk away. They were lost in conversation, their voices low but filled with warmth. I wondered if they saw me or were pretending not to have.

When they reached the lobby, Adrian turned to Dora with a smile. “I’ll see you later,” he said, his tone easy and familiar like how he talked to me before our marriage.

Dora leaned closer, brushing a hand against his arm. “Don’t forget about our plans.”

What plans?

He nodded, his smile unwavering.

As she walked off, her eyes darted to me for a brief moment, her lips curving into a knowing smirk before she disappeared into the elevator.

My hands clenched into fists, my knuckles turning white. Adrian turned to head back into his office, but I stepped forward, blocking his path.

“Adrian,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

He stopped, his gaze cold as it settled on me.

“What are you doing here?” he asked, his tone devoid of any emotion.

“I came to talk,” I replied, fighting the anger in my voice. “Why didn't you come…”

“Not now,” he cut me off, signaling to Rita with his hand. “Make sure no one disturbs me.”

Rita stepped forward, her presence creating a distance between us.

“But…” I started, only for him to turn and walk back into his office, the door clicking shut behind him.

The humiliation burned like fire in my chest. I didn’t argue further. I couldn't keep on embarrassing myself there was no point. I made my way to the car garage.

My marriage was supposed to be my shield, my safe place, but here, it was nothing more than a badge of shame.

In the dimly lit garage, I spotted Dora standing by her car, her posture relaxed as she waited. When our eyes met, her smirk returned, sharper this time.

“You look upset,” she said, her tone dripping with mock concern. “Rough day?”

I ignored her, walking to my car, but she stepped in front of me, blocking my path.

“You know, Olivia,” she began, her voice sweet but laced with venom, “you really shouldn’t cling to a man who clearly doesn’t want you. It’s… sad and pathetic.”

I told myself to calm down, I refused to let her see my pain. “Is there something you want?” I asked, keeping my tone as steady as I could.

She laughed, a sound that made my chest tighten. “I just thought I’d give you some girly advice.”

I clenched my fists, biting back the urge to lash out. “Are you done?” I asked, but didn't wait for her response.

As I opened my car door, her parting words reached me. “You’re fighting a losing battle, Olivia. You should know when to quit.”

I drove home in silence, her words settling over me like a dark cloud.

That night, Adrian didn’t come home early which had become a routine ever since he came back from his supposed business trip.

And I knew it was because of Dora.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I found myself walking toward the one place Adrian had forbidden me to enter – his study.

I had a strong feeling that I might find something there that would reveal more about Dora and her relationship with Adrian.

I hesitated in front of the door, my pulse racing, but Dora’s smug smile flashed in my mind and I found myself breaking the rules I hadn't broken in three years.

While going through his drawers, I stumbled upon an old, slightly worn-out photograph that made my heartbeat slow and froze me in place.

It was a picture of young Adrian, a pretty woman holding him close, whom I assumed to be his mother because of the resemblance, and my parents, all smiling at the camera.

Everything in me screamed confusion. Why were they together? How was this possible?

My parents never seemed to know Adrian when I first introduced him to them, and even Adrian never mentioned knowing my parents.

My head was filled with different questions, each one adding to the headache that was starting to build.

Why hadn’t Adrian mentioned knowing my parents? Was he hiding something from me? Or was there something my parents had kept from me?

I was snapped back to reality when I heard the door click open downstairs. My heart leaped, and I quickly shoved the photograph back into the drawer, my hands trembling as I hurried back to the bedroom.

Adrian walked in without a word, and the room was filled with the stench of alcohol. I stood awkwardly by the bed, unsure whether to speak or remain silent.

Without warning, he closed the distance between us, his hands gripped my waist.

I hated the way my heart leaped, I knew I should have pushed him, yelled at him, or better still slapped him but I found myself yearning for more.

My heart thumped faster as he kissed me, his movements hungry like a lion that had been starved for days.

“Adrian,” I whispered, but he silenced me, pulling me closer and undressing me.

I knew I shouldn't enjoy it but I did.

That night, he touched me for the second time in three years.

I remembered the first time we were intimate a month ago he was drunk and tonight he was also drunk.

I knew what it meant but I deceived my mind into thinking that it was a hope that things might get better.

The next morning, Adrian acted as if nothing had happened. He stood by the dresser, buttoning his shirt while I lay in bed, watching him.

“Good morning,” I greeted, a blush creeping up my cheeks.

He didn’t respond, his focus was on his tie.

“Adrian,” I said softly, sitting up. “About last night…”

He turned to me, his expression cold. “What about it?”

I hesitated, unsure how to interpret his tone. “I… I just thought…”

“Don’t overthink it,” he interrupted. “I sent some money to your account. Consider it payment for your services.”

His words hit me like a punch to the gut. My lips parted, but no sound came out.

Without another glance, he grabbed his briefcase and left, leaving me sitting there in stunned silence.

Tears blurred my vision as I clutched the sheets, my heart bleeding.

Was this what I had become? A service to be paid for?

# CHAPTER 004

OLIVIA'S POV

I gripped the steering wheel, my hands tight as I drove. I had no destination in mind I just needed to leave the house that constantly reminded me of my failing marriage and emotionally unavailable husband.

The words Adrian had said that morning kept playing in my head, no matter how much I tried to distract myself.

My chest hurt, and I wanted to scream. Three years of marriage, and yet, I was just something he could use. I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed to get away.

Eventually, hours later, I drove back home. I parked in the driveway but stayed in the car for a minute, taking deep breaths. My eyes were still red from crying, and everything felt heavy inside me.

When I finally walked inside, the first thing I saw was a pair of red heels by the door. They weren’t mine. My stomach dropped, and panic rushed in.

I took a deep breath and started walking upstairs. With every step, my heart beat faster. I wanted to turn around and run, but something inside me kept going forward, pushing me to face whatever was waiting.

When I reached the bedroom door, I hesitated. My hand gripped the handle for a while. But I pushed it open anyway.

What I saw froze me.

Dora was lying on the bed, half-dressed, her gown slipping off her shoulder. Adrian was next to her, still in his shirt and pants, fast asleep.

My stomach twisted. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. For a second, I just stood there, staring at them, still not believing my eyes.

Adrian cheating on me was something I could overlook because of love but what I could never take was him bringing his mistress to our home on our matrimonial bed.

That was a disrespect I could never tolerate.

“Adrian!” I shouted, my voice echoing in the room.

Adrian’s eyes fluttered open. He blinked and then looked at me.

A look of confusion crossed his face as he glanced over at Dora who was lying next to him but in a blink of an eye, his face went from that to something colder, more distant.

“Olivia,” he said, voice groggy. He rubbed his eyes like he was just waking from a nap.

I wanted to scream, but I kept my fists clenched and stared at him, waiting for an explanation. Then Dora moved beside him, stretching and smiling at me.

“Oh, Olivia,” she said sweetly, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “You’re home early.”

Her smile, her tone – it made everything worse.

“What is this… Adrian?” I asked, my voice breaking.

He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, looking tired. “Calm down, Olivia,” he said like it was my fault.

“Calm down?” I repeated, my voice getting louder. “You brought her into our matrimonial bed, and now you want me to calm down?”

Dora laughed softly, wrapping the blanket around herself like she was perfectly at ease. “Oh, darling,” she said, her eyes sharp, “don’t make a scene.”

Her words made me sick, but I refused to let her see me lose control. I turned to Adrian. “You don’t even care enough to deny it?”

He looked at me with no emotion, then shrugged. “There’s nothing to deny,” he said, his voice cold.

That hit me like a punch. I felt weak, but I forced myself to stay standing.

He wasn't even remorseful of his action. Was this what I was going to keep on enduring?

No, not anymore. I was tired, tired of the insults and humiliation.

“I want a divorce,” I said. The words just came out.

Since he doesn't love me we can as well stop this hypocritical marriage.

Adrian raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Go ahead,” he said, not bothered at all.

My heart sank. I guess I expected him to beg me.

“But don’t forget who’s funding your parents’ company.”

His words hit me like a slap.

He continued voice like ice. “If you leave, Olivia, I will pull all the money I’ve put in. Let’s see how long they last without me.”

Tears blurred my vision. Without saying anything else, I turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind me.

I collapsed on the couch downstairs, the weight of it all crushing me. The betrayal, the humiliation, the fact that he didn't want to let me go – it was too much.

He said he didn't love me, but now I offered to leave his life and he still wouldn't let me.

I covered my face with my hands and let the tears fall, knowing no matter what he did, he still had the upper hand.

# CHAPTER 005

OLIVIA'S POV

I paced back and forth in my parent's living room, my fists clenched tightly, trying to control the overwhelming anger and hurt that swelled inside me.

My parents were sitting on the couch, looking at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

“Olivia, you have to understand,” my mother said, her voice calm and soothing like she always did when she was trying to manipulate me and make me do her bidding.

“Adrian’s investments in the company, the money, it’s all for the family. We can’t afford to lose that.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Was this really how they saw me? A tool to keep the business running?

After telling them what I was going through in that marriage and how I caught him cheating on me on our matrimonial bed without even feeling guilty about his actions after I caught him but instead threatened me.

This was what my biological mother could say to me.

I wanted to yell, but I didn’t. Instead, I clenched my jaw and spoke through gritted teeth. “What about me? What about my happiness?” My voice was barely a whisper, but the hurt was clear in every word.

My father shifted in his seat, avoiding my eyes. “You know how important the business is to this family, Olivia,” he said. “You need to put that first. Adrian’s not perfect, but… staying with him, it’s the only way forward.”

I couldn’t believe this. They weren’t even looking at the bigger picture, weren’t seeing how broken I was.

How every day with Adrian damaged my self-esteem, causing me emotional trauma.

“I’m not a business deal, Dad!” I snapped. “You’re telling me to sacrifice my life just so you can keep this empire afloat. What about me? What about my future?”

My mother’s expression hardened, and she stood up, walking over to me. “We’re trying to help you, Olivia,” she said, her tone now loud. “You have a responsibility to your family, to this company. Adrian’s your husband, whether you like it or not.”

I felt the tears welling up in my eyes. “I’m hurting Mom, I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m not just some… accessory to this business. I'm your child – your blood”

My words hung in the air, but nothing changed. They were focused on the company, not me. I felt like I was suffocating.

I couldn’t take it anymore. With my heart racing, I stormed out of the house, slamming the door behind me. I needed to get away, to think, to know my next step.

I walked out onto the estate, trying to clear my head. I was so lost, so trapped. My feet took me further down the long driveway, my mind a whirlwind of confusion and anger.

That’s when I saw her.

Dora. 

The woman Adrian cheated on me with.

She was standing by the entrance to the estate like she’d been waiting for me. A smirk curled on her lips when she saw me.

What was she doing here? Was she also living here?

The White estate was quite expensive to afford. The apartment my parents lived in was bought by Adrian after we got married as a gift. I wondered how she could afford it, well I didn't know much about her.

Dora didn’t have to say anything, I could feel the challenge in the air between us.

I stopped in my tracks, feeling every nerve in my body tense. I didn’t have the energy for this, not now. But I knew she wasn’t going to make it easy for me.

“Olivia,” she said, her voice dripping with venom and a fake smile etched on her face. “I didn’t expect to see you out here. Is everything okay at home? Or are you just too embarrassed to face Adrian after all that happened?”

My heart raced at the mention of Adrian. I wanted to walk away, but her words felt like a slap in the face. I stood my ground, meeting her gaze. “What do you want?”

She stepped closer, her heels clicking on the pavement. “What do I want? Oh, nothing much. Just wanted to see if you were still playing the dutiful wife… making a fool out of yourself.”

I could feel the anger boiling up inside me. And I was tempted to slap her across the face, but I held back. “Don’t think you’re better than me,” I spat. “You’re just a pathetic little whore.”

Smack!

Her hands landed on my cheeks and I must admit it stung so bad. I also retaliated and slapped her too then started walking towards my car.

I was done trying to be gentle.

One minute I was walking to my car, the next I found myself falling face down, and I crashed to the pavement.

Dora pushed me.

Pain shot up my spine, and I gasped, but it was nothing compared to the sharp, burning pain in my abdomen.

I tried to lift myself, but something was wrong. I could feel the blood, the warmth spreading across my legs. My breath caught in my throat, panic flooding my senses and I could feel myself losing consciousness.

“Help me” I managed to whisper.

Dora stood there, her expression now more smug than ever, like she’d won some game.

“Oops… Guess you’re just too fragile for this,” she said, her tone mocking. But even her words seemed distant now. I could barely hear her.

Everything felt blurry like I was sinking. I didn’t know how long I lay there.

Then I heard someone shouting for help before I blacked out completely.

# CHAPTER 006

OLIVIA'S POV

Beep. Beep.

Those were the first sounds I heard as my consciousness slowly returned. My eyelids felt impossibly heavy, and every part of my body ached as if I had been run over by a truck. 

I blinked several times, my vision blurry and unfocused, trying to make sense of my surroundings. The harsh fluorescent lights above me were blinding, forcing me to shut my eyes momentarily before attempting to open them again.

I was in a hospital.

The scent of antiseptics and the faint humming of machines confirmed it before I could fully process my memories. Panic gripped me as flashes of what had happened resurfaced in my mind.

Dora.

I gasped softly, my fingers twitching against the cool sheets of the hospital bed. The memory of her smug expression, her taunting words, the pain that followed after she deliberately pushed me everything came crashing down at once. My breathing became shallow as fear and rage swirled in my chest.

A soft rustling sound drew my attention, and I sluggishly turned my head. A couple of nurses were standing near my bed, their expressions unreadable as they monitored the machines around me. One of them noticed my movement and immediately hurried out of the room, presumably to call the doctor.

I tried to sit up, but an intense wave of dizziness crashed over me, forcing me to fall back onto the pillows with a sharp exhale. My body felt weak, more exhausted than I had ever been in my life.

Moments later, the doctor walked in, his expression professional yet kind. He quickly checked my vitals, his brows furrowing slightly as he made notes on his clipboard. I wanted to speak, to ask what had happened to me, but my throat was dry, and my voice refused to come out.

“How are you feeling?” he asked, his tone calm and reassuring.

I tried to respond, but my lips barely moved. Seeing my struggle, he shook his head gently. “Relax. There’s no need to stress yourself. You’re still recovering, and your body needs rest.”

I swallowed dryly and rubbed my eyes with trembling fingers, still trying to sit up properly. I felt so disoriented, so lost. Something was nagging at the back of my mind – a deep, unsettling feeling that I was forgetting something crucial.

Then, the doctor continued speaking, explaining the extent of my injuries. My head was still spinning, making it difficult to fully grasp his words, but then I caught a sentence that sent ice shooting through my veins.

“I’m sorry, Miss, but you lost your baby.”

My eyes snapped open in shock. My heart stopped for a moment as my mind struggled to comprehend his words.

Baby?

I was pregnant?

And I lost it?

The words felt foreign, unreal like I had stepped into someone else’s nightmare.

“What…what did you just say?” I forced the words out, my voice barely above a whisper.

The doctor’s expression softened. “The little accident you were involved in caused you to lose your pregnancy. I’m truly sorry for your loss.”

I felt my heart clench, an unbearable weight pressing down on my chest. My hands instinctively moved to my abdomen, but there was nothing there – nothing but the dull ache of loss. 

My baby was gone. A child I hadn’t even known existed had been taken from me before I could even dream of its future.

Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring my vision as the reality of it all settled in. The walls of the hospital room seemed to close in on me, suffocating me. My breath hitched, and the machine beside me began to beep faster and faster as my heart rate spiked.

“Miss, you need to calm down,” the doctor urged his hands checking my pulse as the nurse adjusted the IV in my arm.

But how could I calm down? How could I just accept this?

The doctor continued speaking, but his voice faded into the background as my thoughts spiraled. My entire life had been a cycle of pain and disappointment. For three years, I had endured nothing but sorrow, and now this? How much more could the world take from me before it decided I had suffered enough?

I sobbed silently, gripping the sheets tightly, my body shaking as grief consumed me.

Then, another emotion began to take root, burning through my sorrow like fire consuming dry wood.

Rage.

Dora.

That witch had taken everything from me – my dignity, my pride, and now, my child. This wasn’t just an accident. It was her doing. She had done this to me, and she was going to pay.

Through my tears, I heard the doctor and the nurse discussing something a few feet away. I forced myself to listen despite the pounding in my head.

“Were you able to get in touch with any of her contacts?” the doctor asked the nurse.

“Yes, I called her husband and informed him,” the nurse responded.

There was a pause before the doctor spoke again. “So, he should be on his way then?”

The nurse hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. “Actually…he said he wasn’t coming.”

A bitter laugh almost escaped my lips.

Of course, Adrian wouldn’t come. What was I expecting? He had never cared about me. Why would he start now?

The doctor frowned. “Are you sure he said that?”

“Absolutely. Even I was shocked by his response. I honestly don’t know how he can leave his wife alone in a situation like this,” the nurse replied, her voice tinged with disbelief.

The doctor sighed. “Try reaching out to another one of her contacts perhaps her parents or a close friend.”

“Alright, sir,” the nurse responded, scrolling through my phone.

I shut my eyes, forcing myself to push past the fresh wave of pain. I knew my parents would show up. They had to. Despite our differences, they wouldn’t abandon me in a moment like this.

At least, that was what I hoped.

Eventually, exhaustion overtook my body, and I slipped into a restless sleep, my mind haunted by the loss I had suffered.

Hours later, I was woken by the sound of a familiar, deep voice beside me. My eyelids fluttered open, my vision still a bit blurry from sleep.

For a fleeting moment, I thought it was Adrian, that maybe just maybe he had decided to come after all. But as my vision cleared, I saw that it wasn’t him.

It was Julian.

My heart clenched at the sight of him. Julian, my best friend, the one person who had always been there for me no matter what. We had known each other since college, our bond unshaken despite the chaos Adrian had thrown our way in a bid to seperate our friendship.

He was sitting beside my bed, his sharp blue eyes filled with worry as he studied me.

“Liv,” he murmured, his voice softer than I’d ever heard it before. “Thank God you’re awake.”

Tears welled up in my eyes again, but this time, they weren’t just from pain.They were from relief.

1kmdyo1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kmdyo1,Workshop pet caterpillar,"Hello all, 
about this time last year me and a fellow engineer found 2 enormous caterpillars that had survived going through a wood chipper and a wood grader and were found crawling across the concrete yard. For some reason we picked them up and I decided I would keep them as workshop pets in my fabrication shop. I put them in this closed plastic jar with some dirt and wood and I stuck a clump of grass in there for good measure. To my surprise upon putting them in there they had within an hour buried themselves right in the bottom. I thought it a bit strange so I just stuck the jar on the top shelf of some racking under a sun panel in the roof so that it had some light and I stuck half a cup of water in there every other month or so for good measure. It has since been a running joke that they are dead and everyone who comes in asks about the mysterious jar of dirt and the how they are definitely dead.
Rolling forward to a year later, I was walking to grab a cup of coffee I happened to glance at said jar and I realised that there was a shape in the side that wasn’t there before, and upon closer inspection the a moth has finally crawled out?! Both shocked and confused I grabbed a cup of water and doused him with a splash in case he was thirsty (he’s called David) as he looked very dry and sad (he looked dead) but he was very much alive. I have since put the jar outside with the lid off and he has woken up and spread his wings and had a walk around, though he is yet to leave his house. I have put the jar outside in the shade so he can fly off if he wants to, no sign of his sibling as of yet though. 
The thought of Dave leaving after a year of living in his terrarium and looking after him is sad indeed and I don’t know how I will cope with his departure. 
How long will he live now that he has been reborn? Will he find other moth friends to bring home to his jar or will he be alone forever? Will I have to pay child support if he leaves? 

These questions weigh heavy on my mind ",4,1747225889.0,moths,6,0.84,False

1kmdy0m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kmdy0m,Li-Ning Jimmy Butler Buckets Barista,"

Hi,
I received the Li-Ning Jimmy Butler Buckets Barista (2025) sneakers. Haven’t made it to the gym yet, but here are my first impressions and photos.

The sneakers arrived from AliExpress in 9 days, costing around $80. The box is standard for the Buckets series, though I expected a special limited-edition one. I was drawn to the sneakers because of the brown color palette and, of course, Jimmy Butler himself. I follow Pantone trends, and Mocha Mousse being this year’s color, these sneakers match that palette perfectly, especially the midfoot section. I don’t drink coffee, but I enjoy cocoa, so the coffee-themed design resonates with me—plus, cafés usually serve cocoa too. I haven’t tried Big Face Coffee, but I hope they offer cocoa. I know Jimmy loves Italy.

I haven’t hit the gym yet (I’m 188 cm tall, 78 kg), but compared to my previous Nike Ja 1s, these Li-Nings feel more comfortable in size 12 (foot length: 290 mm).

This is my first experience with Li-Ning, and I’m blown away by the price-to-quality ratio. I debated between the Buckets Barista and JB3 Coffee, but the JB3’s bulky contrasting logo on the heel didn’t align with my design preferences.

Design is clearly a strength for Li-Ning’s Way of Wade and Jimmy Butler lines. Impressed by the quality, I also ordered a pair of JB3 Big Yellow Boot for everyday wear—they’ve brilliantly adapted Timberland’s iconic style into basketball sneakers, adding their own tech and flair instead of just copying it. Honestly, I’ve never seen Timberland make sneakers this stylish.

Now I’m a Li-Ning fan and will definitely recommend their sneakers!

1kmdwxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1kmdwxg/my_mil_is_the_bane_of_my_existence/,My MIL is the bane of my existence,"Exactly what the title says. It all started when we first announced I was pregnant. She would call my fiancé 3 times a day minimum to talk for an hour each time about her issues and advice for me. Here’s the kicker she only raised him until he was 1.5 plus his brother is only 11m younger. They were both taken from her and were raised by their grandma while she hopped in and out of their lives. If my fiancé didn’t answer her immediately she’d go on rants about how he doesn’t love her and no one will care when she dies. I finally had enough and messaged her myself about how that is emotionally abusive and clearly he does love her by how often they talk even though he doesn’t want to but he does it for her. A seperate time I thanked her for the advice but reminded her I was 12 when my brother was born and 16 for my sister so I’ve had a good amount of experience and know my plan. She also doesn’t take care of herself so she now has a hard time walking. She was walking just fine in Feb 2024 when she got married and just stopped trying so eventually she had to rely more and more on her wheelchair. She would complain about how I said I wanted to wait 2 months before anyone visited (which was really because of her health problems but I included everyone so she wouldn’t feel left out) because she might lose her ability to use her arms in the future. Which is bs. I’ve seen her walk up the stairs, albeit slowly, but it’s not from sickness that makes arms usage loss even an idea. 

Throughout my pregnancy my OB was an hour and a half away where my finances aunt and great grandma live so we would stop to see them most times. They both knew most likely they wouldn’t meet him until the next summer when he’d be between 6m-8m because of how harsh out winters were and the drive so we just tried to see them as much as possible before we had him. We didn’t stop to see him mom every time because she was only 20 minutes from our house so we knew she’d meet him multiple times and she called so much we didn’t need to see her in person. She also would say she’s perfectly healthy then drop the bomb she has a cold, pneumonia, ecoli infection or whatever the day after we visited. 

The day of my baby shower she called while we were setting up, just me and my fiancé were there and it was supposed to start in 15 minutes so we were scrambling, she asked if it’s wheelchair accessible and my fiancé said i think there’s a tiny step but it’s not anything you couldn’t handle. She said “Can you go look and make sure you’re right?” mind you, she was already in town driving around with her husband so they could’ve just come themselves. When he said he needed to keep setting up because we were running behind she said “I guess we just won’t come. Sorry you won’t have any family there” and hung up on him. After our shower was over she called him screaming about how he doesn’t care about her, we’re never going to let her meet the baby, I’m keeping her son from her, she just wants to be there because she could die at any moment and since he couldn’t say goodbye to his dad doesn’t he want to be able to say bye to her, how she hopes when my son grows up his future wife keeps him from me and treats me the same, all sorts of bs. She then blocked me on FB. He reemed into her about her comments about me and his dad then blocked her for the day. She apologized to him a week later and unblocked me. We drafted a text together about how she needs to apologize to me too and if anything like this happens again we’re going no contact. She never apologized to me and I used to excuse to block her on FB. (She’s still blocked lmao but she can’t bring it up without acknowledging what she did. ) 

When he was born we let her peer through the window on our way home but that was it. For my finances christmas present she had to audacity to ask for pictures of our LO by himself or with my fiancé so she could make a coffee cup and he could see his family whenever he drank from it. I said “so you want pictures with me included then?” She quickly corrected herself. 

Christmas was the first time we came over with him. He was a little over 2 months. He slept the whole time so she was only able to look at him. Her birthday was in January and we went over there again, he was sleeping but she WOKE HIM UP so that she could hold him. He cried the entire time and I ended up having to BF him in the truck to calm him down. I didn’t feel comfortable doing it in front of her husband and grown male kids. I just don’t feel comfortable in her house period. He was miserable for hours afterwards. When she called to thank us, I let her know it was wrong and that we’re going to have to only come over when we know he’s going to be happy and awake which hinders our ability to come. She was wounded but kept her mouth mostly shut since my fiancé reminded her of what he said last time she flipped out. Our baby got sick immediately after our visit and we found out from my finances grandma she had a flipping cold. We had to give him breathing treatments and he was wheezing. My poor baby 😭. I didn’t say anything to her But I will if I have to flip out again. I will not hold anything back next time and she will be blocked everywhere. 

Another problem is i’m allergic to cats, they had 7 when she found out and at this time now has 12!!!! There is a high chance our baby will be allergic too because my fiancé is as well but he loves cats so he suffered with no complaint. She tells us she will lock them away and deep clean everytime we’re going to come but tells us we didn’t give her enough notice even if we plan a week ahead of time. She does lock the cats up but leaves one out everytime. Which I tell her one  cat is enough to set off my allergies so if she wants to leave the one out just don’t go through the trouble and i’ll triple up on my meds. She keeps doing it and not letting me know. She wants our LO to come over and crawl around and I told her he can’t until it’s summer, we will just hang out outside with his baby tent because I want to know his allergies first, not throw him in the deep end. 

She also took money from my fiancé when he lived with her from 20-21, 4 grand. But she’ll text us about them buying a brand new bed with tax returns and take money from the church for their bills. She had a whole go fund me going too for their truck repair. She never listens about what toys my LO would want and is insisting on getting us a ball pit that we’d have no space for. It just NEVER ENDS. We end up getting rid of everything she gives us pretty much. 

TLDR: My MIL sucks and I wish we could go no contact. We’d all be better off but my fiancé is too nice a guy who was emotionally manipulated by her for too long so we haven’t yet but fingers crossed in the future we can.

Update - thanks everyone for the good leads so far!

Me: a mid-30s social worker, no kids, 2 pit bulls, progressive, not religious, fairly high tolerance for a bit of sketchiness, like living in an area where I can walk to some things (coffee shops, restaurants, thrift stores, etc). I can’t live in an apartment/duplex because my dogs are used to live in the house and they are a bit barky with noises - I need to find somewhere that I can reasonably expect to be able to afford a house (under 200k). Looking for a community feel as much as possible, but a city vibe. I previously lived in Koreatown in Los Angeles, and I did enjoy that. However, I would not have been able to buy a home there because most of the area was apartments. 

Likes: reading, thrifting, good food, walkability, old houses/spaces.

Dislikes: greige flooring (that weird grey/brown faux wood laminate), old houses flipped into generic nightmares, suburbs vibe

I'm in the two week wait for my second round of IUI, but I'm just not feeling good about it. My test is next week but I'd like to prepare some self-care rituals in the event it's negative. 

My usual go-tos are having a nice drink, eating sushi, getting a fat cup of good coffee, etc. But after my first round of IUI was negative, those things were actually more painful because I kept thinking ""I miss this stuff but I was ready to give it all up without remorse for a baby."" Tho still planning to indulge in all those things if it's negative this time lol. 

This time around, I'm thinking of taking the morning off work, going to a favorite coffee shop, and just doing some reflection about what I want my life to look like in the next few years if we don't have kids. 

And then I'll get sushi for lunch and plan a tattoo to get in a month 😄  

I'm looking for other (whether silly or serious) things to do, like go to a determalogist and not worry about pregnancy-safe skincare, get my hair done without worrying about the chemicals, going back to heavy weightlifting and high-intensity workouts, etc. Also, did anyone start going to therapy for this?

Now we’re in the same school, same block, and even the same circle in college. We were still close during the first semester, but in the second semester, I started feeling like she doesn’t like me anymore. Sometimes it feels like she does, but most of the time, it feels like she doesn’t. What’s more confusing is that she’s really sweet and touchy with our other friends, she used to be like that with me too, but now she feels so distant. I honestly don’t get her mood most of the time.

Since we’re always together, I noticed that she tends to complain a lot and wants things done her way. When that doesn’t happen, you can really see how disappointed she gets. I understand that it can be disappointing but sometimes she comes off as too bossy.

She also tends to judge our decisions, but when we give her the same energy, she doesn’t like it. There are times she gets annoyed when I can’t give her the answer during quizzes or exams. But sometimes, I’m just unsure, didn’t hear the question, or I’m afraid we’ll get caught talking. Most of the time, though, I help her and our other friends when I can.

One time, we were at the store with another friend. We bought coffee and drank it there. When we were about to go back, I accidentally spilled mine and it splashed a little on her uniform. I apologized right away, it was really an accident. I get why she was upset since our uniform is all pure white, but it was just a small dot. I still said sorry several times because I know how particular she is about being neat. But the whole walk back, she was still mad. She kept saying “bwisit” while trying to wipe it off, all the way to the classroom. I felt really guilty. It was my fault, and I didn’t know how to fix it. Even our other two friends stayed quiet because her mood shifted. She let the whole thing ruin her day.

Because of how guilty I felt, I started distancing myself. I stayed quiet when we were together. Eventually, she talked to me again during dismissal because we're always go home together and since then happened we still go to school and go home together. But i can still really feel the distance between us.

Hey there,
I’m 30, based somewhere in the Middle East, and figured I’d give Reddit a try. Not here for anything too deep — just hoping to meet someone cool to talk to, share a few laughs, and maybe more if we click.

I work in a quiet office job that lets me enjoy the little things in life — late-night walks, good coffee, and random YouTube rabbit holes. I’m a big fan of football, music that actually has meaning, and those underrated movies no one talks about.

Not looking for drama or games. Just someone down-to-earth, maybe a bit witty, who’s also just navigating life and wants to share some time with someone decent.

If you’re real, say hi.

I’m no exception to this.

Just to give a quick example, while I was searching for something casual to play at work, I found Ctrl Alt Deal, or the demo version of it that's out right now. My first thought was - what is this goofy looking cyberpunk office simulator? But that ""wtf cyberpunk office simulator"" turned out to be pretty nice for the free bang it gave me that day at work. Some deck management coupled with decision making, so all in all a decent couple of hours of casual fun to take real office problems off my mind during my downtime. 

Also, one other game that took me a long time to try, but once I did, I ended up spending 20 hours in it, was Schedule 1. I never imagined that being a drug dealer could be that fun. Since I personally don’t do drugs, I didn't think I would like the game at all. But the way I look at this game now is like a farming simulator on steroids and a mountain of coke. Next week I'm traveling to Amsterdam with my girlfriend, and she is trying to convince me intro try some kush there. I highly doubt it, but eh, maybe. If this game were made by a coffee shop, this would be the best marketing idea ever haha

This is what I experienced in Georgia—things I’ve never encountered in other countries:

👎 On my third visit to a café, I was told I could only work there for half an hour. I’m not sure why, as I always ordered more than enough (usually two coffees and a cake for a 2–3 hour stay, sometimes even breakfast). They could have just asked me to order more if there was an issue.

👎 At the Airbnb I stayed in, which cost $680 a month, the heating was never turned on unless I specifically asked. I eventually gave up asking because it felt uncomfortable and awkward.

👎 I also found people to be dishonest. At a shop where I regularly bought donuts and water, I was charged different prices for the same items. I didn’t say anything since it was just a few cents, but it definitely left a negative impression of Georgian people.

Even though many people recommended Georgia to me, and I did meet a lot of people here, I feel like the charm and beauty of the country have faded. I can’t wait to leave this week. Sorry to say, but this has been a disappointing experience.

I woke up early in the morning and got up right away. I was excited. Really, really excited. Tomorrow is my birthday. Tomorrow I will be eighteen and I will meet my wolf. I couldn’t wait to shift for the first time. They say it is painful, but I didn’t care about that part. It is just for a little while, and it gets easier later. I can survive a little bit of pain.

I just wished that my parents were here to see me shift for the first time. It had been eight years since they died, and it hadn’t gotten any easier.

They were killed in a rogue attack.

Rogues are wolves that don’t belong to a pack. They become rogues by being exiled from their packs for committing various crimes. Some of them choose to leave their packs and live like rogues. That is rare, though. We wolves are pack animals. We don’t like being alone. When a wolf chooses to become a rogue, it is mostly because something bad has happened to them in their pack or they have lost their mate, gone crazy and left the pack.

The rogues live alone. They don’t work with other wolves. But when they attacked our pack, they were working together. It was very odd. Since that night, our Alpha learned that there is a rogue wolf who has gathered other rogues to attack various packs. They call him the Rogue King. The attacks haven’t stopped since. They attacked our and other packs multiple times.

On the night of the attack, rogues tried to kill our Alpha’s son. We were celebrating his 18th birthday and his first shift. He was supposed to start his training to become a new Alpha and take over the pack.

However, that night, rogues killed his father, our former Alpha Luke. He was forced to become an Alpha right away. And he did an amazing job. He finished his training early and he made our pack one of the strongest ones.

My father was Alpha Luke’s Beta. He and my mom died protecting Alpha, Luna, and their son. That was their job.

After their deaths, my brother Andrew became Beta. He and our Alpha were best friends since childhood, and now they run our pack together.

My brother is an amazing Beta, and an even better brother. He was 17 when our parents died, and after that, he had to take care of our pack and me. He never complained. He took those responsibilities and did the best he could. And he did great. He always made sure I was safe and taken care of. He still does.

I finished high school a few months ago, and all I have to do now is train. After the attacks, my brother and our Alpha decided that all pack members must train to be able to defend ourselves.

The rule in our pack is that we all must go through high school. It is something similar to a human high school, but we learn werewolf and pack history, pack laws, and everything needed to help the pack function properly. For example, if a wolf is interested in working for Alpha, he or she will learn a bit more about running the pack. If a wolf is interested in agriculture, he or she will learn about plants and our crops to help sustain our food supplies. If a wolf is interested in defending the pack, he or she will learn about defense techniques, attack formations, and they will have to spend more time training than the rest of us. I chose to help the Alpha run our pack. It was natural to me. My brother is the Beta and I wanted to help him as much as I could. So, I learned all about pack laws and everything else needed to successfully run our pack.

The Alpha, Beta and pack healer are the only ones who leave the pack to go train for their positions. They go to different packs where they learn everything needed for their positions in a pack. The training lasts for about a year.

Considering our pack was attacked and our former Alpha was killed, our new Alpha and Beta finished their training in only a couple of months. The pack needed them, and it had to be done quicker than usual. I missed my brother when he left, but I knew it was something he had to do.

We have to train every day, but tomorrow I get a day off because it is my birthday and my first shift. It is a special occasion. The first shift is important because you get to meet your wolf, and your mate.

Mates are important in wolf culture. A mate is your special someone, picked by our Moon Goddess. It is the connection of two souls. Your mate becomes the most important thing to you. You love them instantly. You want and need to be with them and protect them.

My brother still hasn’t found his mate. And neither did our Alpha. So, until he does, his mother, Gloria, still has the Luna title and does the Luna duties.

She had a hard time after her mate, our former Alpha, passed away. She almost didn’t make it. She didn’t eat, sleep or do anything. That is what happens when you lose your mate. Your will to live goes away. However, she recovered, and she is an amazing Luna. I love her a lot. She helped me and my brother after our parents died, and she and I have a special relationship. She is like a mother to me.

I asked her to be present for my first shift. She accepted and gave me a big hug. It is a big deal to be present for a wolf’s first shift. At least in our pack. Each pack has its own tradition, but in ours, only the wolves you choose get to witness your first shift. And it was an honor to be chosen.

I chose my brother, Luna Gloria, and my friends Amy and Jacob. They were all honored and excited for me.

I couldn’t wait to shift. It will be amazing. And maybe I will be luckier than my brother and meet my mate soon.

I had to go to training soon, so I brushed my teeth, took a quick shower and got dressed. I put on my black tights, training bra, grey hoodie and my black Nike sneakers. I tied my long brown hair into a ponytail and went downstairs.

# Chapter 2

I was unpleasantly surprised when I came downstairs. Sienna was standing in my kitchen looking at me like she wanted to kill me.

She is my brother’s and Alpha’s best friend. She is 25, just like my brother and Alpha, and she has been hanging out with them since childhood. Now, she is clinging on to them like they are a lifeboat. She was devastated when she found out that neither my brother nor Alpha were her mates. That didn’t stop her from trying to become Luna. She is always around Alpha, proving herself and trying to convince him to take her as his chosen mate.

Werewolves can do that. If their mate dies or they don’t find their true mate, they can take a chosen one. It is frowned upon, especially in our pack, because we take mates very seriously. Most packs do, actually. But some have a milder attitude toward chosen mates.

Sienna was tall, blonde, and perfect. Her make up was always on point. Her hair was always combed and styled to perfection. But she destroyed all that with the way she behaved. She was bitchy, mean, and disrespectful. She hated me and treated me like I was trash. But only when we were alone. When we were around my brother or Alpha, she was a totally different person. She was nice to me, and she once told my brother that I was like a little sister to her. Yuck. I tried telling my brother about her, but he didn’t believe me. He told me I was jealous of her and how much time they spent together.

“Sienna.” I said coldly and grabbed a mug from a cupboard.

“Good morning, ugly.” she said and smirked. “It must be good to sleep as long as you do.”

“Maybe you should try it to.” I said as I poured coffee into my mug. “You need as much beauty sleep as you can get.”

I turned towards her with a smirk on my face. She was pissed.

“You little bitch.” she said through her teeth. “I will become Luna soon and I will exile you so soon you will not be able to blink.”

She always did this. She threatened to exile me when she would become a Luna. I knew she would actually do it, and I could only hope she didn’t become a Luna.

I wanted to say something back, but I heard the front door open. My brother and our Alpha walked into our kitchen. Sienna quickly put on the biggest fake smile on her face.

I rolled my eyes. How didn’t anybody see how fake she was?

“Good morning, little one.” my brother said and kissed my forehead.

That was his favorite nickname for me. I was small, smaller than any wolf my age, and he liked to point that out. Especially because he was huge. 6’4, and had muscles all over his body, just like Alpha.

We looked a lot alike. We both had brown hair and bright blue eyes. He was more tanned than me, though. I inherited my mom’s pale complexion. I wa out in the sun all the time, but I couldn’t seem to get tanned.

“Good morning, Andrew. Good morning, Logan.” I said and smiled.

I get to call Alpha by his first name only in the privacy of our homes. On other occasions, I must refer to him as Alpha. Or Alpha Logan.

Sienna didn’t like that. She gave me an ‘I will kill you’ look over their shoulders.

“Good morning, Emma.” Logan said as he sat at our kitchen table.

“What are your plans today, Em?” Andrew asked as he poured coffee for himself and Logan.

“Nothing much.” I responded. “I have a training session in an hour and then I will just hang out with Amy and Jacob.”

“Tomorrow is your first shift. Are you excited?” Logan asked me and took his coffee mug from my brother.

“Yes.” I said and smiled brightly. “I can’t wait to meet my wolf.”

“Maybe you will find your mate, Emma.” Sienna said coldly. “And maybe we will lose you to him tomorrow.”

She gave a fake sad look to my brother. Goddess, they were so blind if they didn’t see through her act.

“Don’t worry, Sienna.” my brother said. “She will always be our little sister. No mate will take that away from us.”

I wanted to scream and throw up. She was not my sister! She was a fake bitch who couldn’t wait to get rid of me! But I couldn’t say anything, so I just gave him a fake smile.

“After your shift, you can start working at a pack house.” Logan said. “You went to high school to work at the pack office, right?”

“I did.” I said and smiled. “I can’t wait to start working.”

“Good.” Logan said and smiled.

He was handsome, even more when he smiled. And that was rare. He was usually very serious and focused only on his job as an Alpha. He always did what’s best for his pack. That was why he was so successful.

He was as tall and as muscular as my brother. Maybe even more. The alpha and beta of the pack were always the strongest wolves. And it always showed. You could always see who alpha and beta were. He had dark blonde hair and green eyes. His jaw and his nose were chiseled perfectly, and his lips looked soft. He was hot. No wonder Sienna was all over him.

She drooled after my brother as well but being Beta’s mate wasn’t good enough for her. Although, if my brother took her as his chosen mate, she would accept that as well. She was only after the title and power. Too bad they couldn’t see that.

We met a few times at the library and got along really well, and I’ve been thinking about asking her out — partly because I like her, but also because I want to stop overthinking and know where I stand.

I have a few questions though, especially since this would be our first actual hangout outside the library:
	1.	How do I even ask her out without sounding too intense?
Like can I just say “I want to take you on a date”? Or is that too much? What’s a smooth way to ask that feels casual but still shows I’m being real?
	2.	Where should I take her?
I don’t want to do something boring like just “grab a coffee” — I want something that’s fun but not awkward or too try-hard either. Any creative, low-pressure ideas?
	3.	Would a girl go out with a guy who can’t pick her up?
I don’t have my license yet, so I can’t drive. Would that be a red flag? If not, how should I plan things around that — like, should I meet her there or is it okay to ask her to come to a location on her own?
	4.	What do girls expect on a first date nowadays?
Like emotionally — are they expecting something chill, something flirty, something deep?

Any advice would really help. I genuinely like her but I don’t want to come off as awkward or overdo things.

Thanks!
