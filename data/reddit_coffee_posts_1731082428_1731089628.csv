1gmp0ob,https://v.redd.it/jo1abmipxpzd1,(can't) GRIND FINER - Eureka mignon zero,"Hi fellow coffee nerds, 

I'm having an issue with my grinder (Eureka Mignon Zero). Seems like I can't grind finer than at this setting (see video). 

Problem is, I can't get proper extraction at this grind size (too fast). Around 50g in 30sec at best if I use 19.5g (usually using 18.5g). It happens with some coffee that are medium roast (visually not much difference with others that worked).

Does that happen to you? I mean, I thought this grinder was a decent one and I can't believe I can't get good extraction with medium roasts!

* I have tried putting more coffee in the basket and even lowering pressure (I have a Profitec Go).

Any suggestion on how to fix this, if it is fixable?

Enter the world of Thedas, a vibrant land of rugged wilderness, ancient ruins, and glittering cities – steeped in conflict and secret magics. Now, a pair of corrupt ancient gods have broken free from centuries of darkness and are hellbent on destroying the world.

Thedas needs someone they can count on. You can be that person – as Rook, Dragon Age’s newest hero. Be who you want to be and play how you want to play as you fight to stop the gods from blighting the world. 

https://preview.redd.it/33gme2xq3jzd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63af916b2d23669c28811dbe7d4f35da5680b75d

But you can’t do this alone – the odds are stacked against you. Lead a team of seven Companions, each with their own rich story to discover and shape, and together you will become The Veilguard.

Unite the Veilguard and defy the gods in **Dragon Age™: The Veilguard**, an immersive single-player RPG where you become the leader others believe in.

# The Options Are Endless

Craft your personalized Rook with a robust character creator. Choose from a diverse set of appearance options for Elf, Dwarf, Human, and Qunari lineages. Each lineage includes several preset appearances, as well as the option to completely customize your Rook. These options include the ability to choose the basics, like hair and face shape, and include many more granular choices that allow you to make a character as unique as you’d like.

# Choose Your Way To Play

Choose from three distinct classes: Mage, Rogue, and Warrior. Mages wield powerful spells to control the battlefield; Rogues excel in agility and stealth, striking from the shadows with dual daggers or picking off enemies from a distance with a bow; while Warriors dominate close combat, using either two-handed weapons or a sword and shield. Each class offers unique abilities and playstyles to suit your preference. Experience new strategic depth as you combine fast-paced attacks, parries, and dodges along with the Companion ability wheel to exploit enemy weaknesses and seize victory with devastating combos. Customize a combat style that works for you.

# MAGE

Mages rain down fury with spells that incinerate, freeze, electrocute, and crush. Some cast from afar with a staff, while others prefer close-quarters combat using an orb and dagger.

# ROGUE

https://preview.redd.it/34zsq5ds3jzd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2489001d27def1f9753fb7cf4a4d382ed72e9fa

Rogues utilize quick movement and reflexes. Whether wielding a bow or dual swords, they use powerful, precise strikes for lethal damage.

# WARRIOR

https://preview.redd.it/o8xqrq8t3jzd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2894c83696b8934aff0bfe334d03542c1be60cf

Warriors command the flow of the battlefield. Some lay waste with sword and shield, while others use a two-handed weapon to send enemies flying.

You’ll also choose one of six factions for Rook to belong to. Major players on the stage of Thedas, all of these factions will prove useful allies throughout your story. Your faction choice will influence your Rook’s backstory, conversation options, and potentially the balance of power on this divided continent. Learn more about each faction [here](https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/features).

# The Veilguard

https://preview.redd.it/jlcygrvv3jzd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=163ecdaebcfba0e37f322cbb14c5797cc2e3efb0

**Unite Your Team of Seven Companions**

Recruit a team of unique Companions, each with their own expertise and abilities. Choose who to take into battle and face demons, dragons, and corrupt gods together.

**Meet Your Companions:**

Harding: The Scout

Neve: The Detective

Bellara: The Veil Jumper

Lucanis: The Mage Killer

Davrin: The Warden

Emmrich: The Necromancer

Taash: The Dragon Hunter

**Rich Companion Stories**

Build relationships with your Companions as you explore Thedas. Your choices will shape their stories and unlock powerful abilities, creating unforgettable moments and strengthening your bond as a team.

# Gameplay

https://reddit.com/link/1gmox1l/video/k7ui1dgp4jzd1/player

**Combat**

Combat in Dragon Age: The Veilguard happens in real time, with players making split-second, strategic decisions that can turn the tide of battle. Use your unique class abilities in combination with your Companions’ to prime and detonate massive combos that exploit enemy weaknesses and lay them out. Bring up the ability wheel to pause combat and see what abilities of Rook’s and your chosen companions will prime enemies, and which will detonate combinations. Stack buffs and debuffs to control the battlefield, giving allies powerful advantages and cutting enemies’ power off at the knees.

Get more in-depth on the combat system [here](https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard).

**Progression and Leveling**

Experience comes from completing quests, and the bigger and more momentous the quest, the better the bonus will be. Rook also gains experience from killing enemies and exploring, but gaining levels is most efficient when helping the people of Thedas or taking time to deepen Rook’s bond with the Veilguard. 

Rook’s Companions are equally important to success as the player endeavors to save Thedas. Members of the Veilguard each have their own Levels and each Level gained grants them 2 Skill Points. Each Companion will have quests to deepen Rook’s bond with them, and this is one of the main ways for them to gain experience. Companions also can gain experience through unique conversations and decisions with them. These quests and bonds are not limited to romantic interests; platonic friendships are just as important and in focus in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. 

Learn more about the progression system, leveling (including upgrading items), and Companion progression [here.](https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-and-progression)

**Exploration**

Throughout the story, you will go through many diverse areas, from the beauty of the lush Arlathan Forests to the busy streets of Minrathous. Veterans of the series have heard whispers in the past about each of these places in Thedas, but now you will actually be able to explore and experience them in-game. Each area has its own unique feel and style. There are several areas for exploration; each inviting you to delve deeper into the narrative and uncover the many mysteries Thedas holds.

https://reddit.com/link/1gmox1l/video/pl68c2284jzd1/player

While exploring the world, the Veilguard will come across many things to do and people to talk to. Of course, there will be new and upgraded equipment, but there will also be puzzles and lore! There will be ancient statues, letters, and artifacts left behind to read and collect those Codex Entries. There are also new modes of transportation to find throughout the world, including fast travel. 

https://reddit.com/link/1gmox1l/video/an05ure94jzd1/player

There will be new ways for your Companions to interact with the world as well, with specific exploration abilities. For example, you may come across some ancient Elven artifacts for Bellara to Tinker with while you wander through Arlathan. Even when the Companions are back at the Lighthouse, Rook can use the Lyrium Dagger to take advantage of their exploration abilities. You may also spot Companions out and about, interacting with the world on their own. When heading to Treviso, we recommend finding Lucanis and enjoying a cup of coffee together.

Once in the beginning of October and once in the beginning of November 2024.

This is a rough itinerary of what I did along with some of the places I ate at.

Chicago is a great city with beautiful architecture, very walkable, and many fun things to do.

Great place to be, especially when the weather is good.

Tons of good restaurants and bars if you’re into that.

A city with a metropolitan feel, without the craziness of a metropolitan city such as Los Angeles.

# Chicago October 2024 Trip

My first trip to Chicago was from Los Angeles on Fri Oct 4th thru Sun Oct 6th.

# Airport

I took a 15 minute uber ride from my apartment to LAX. Got to LAX at 6 AM, approximately 2 hours before my flight which departed at 8 AM. I have Global Entry which comes with TSA Precheck, making check in a breeze. Highly recommend investing in Global Entry or TSA Precheck if you fly frequently.

Going through TSA Precheck not only saves you time by shorter lines, but the people that are in line for TSA Precheck are much more prepared to check in faster relative to those who are not. TSA Precheck also allows you to avoid doing things such as taking your laptop out of your bags, which makes checking in that much easier.

If you’re reading this and you don’t have TSA Precheck, do you like wasting time? Look into [Chase Cards](https://ultmeche.com/chase-biz-cards) which could even get you TSA Precheck for free.

# Flight

# LAX to ORD

I flew United Airlines from LAX to Chicago. United seems to have many of the flights that I’ve been needing to take available and have been consistently traveling with them for awhile. United is also a frequent flyer partner with points that you can redeem from the Chase Sapphire card. The flight from LAX to Chicago was approximately 4 hrs.

# ORD to LAX

Upon my return, I flew United Airlines from Chicago to LAX. Nothing too crazy here, but sometimes Sundays coming back to LAX can be bad so you may need to be prepared for that.

# Hotel

I stayed at the JW Marriot located in Downtown Chicago, close to Millennium Park. It is located pretty conveniently and very walkable to locations such as the Riverwalk. I enjoy walking around in a new city, so 30 minutes or even an hour of walking is very enjoyable. Also, walking a lot allows me to feel a lot less guilty when eating out as much as I do on vacation.

Stayed in a standard 1 king bed room, with interior view.

JW Marriot – BedroomJW Marriot – Bathroom / Shower

The JW Marriott is an American luxury hotel brand owned by Marriott International, I’ve been a big fan since I went to [Cancun](https://ultmeche.com/cancun-2024/) back in August of 2024. The staff is always attentive, the rooms are a step up from budget or regular hotels, and I always enjoy staying here.

# Restaurants

# Hwang Soh Grill in Evanston

For dinner, went to Hwang Soh Grill in Evanston, an authentic Korean BBQ restaurant. For food we got premium wagyu brisket, pork belly, and sides consisting of Corn, Japchae, Soybean paste soup, and the typical panchan.

# Egg Harbor Cafe

For breakfast next morning, went to Egg Harbor Cafe in Downtown Chicago. Got the classic breakfast consisting of eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toasted English muffin paired with some black coffee. 

# Shabu Plus Rotary Hotpot – Chinatown

For dinner the next evening, had Shabu Plus in Chinatown. Good Shabu shabu in a trendy, futuristic type of restaurant – the type where they have the robots serving you plates of meat and vegetables on a conveyor belt.

# Activities

Mostly spent the weekend walking around in Downtown Chicago. Luckily, the weather was absolutely beautiful with a high of 78 degrees. 

The architecture of the buildings in Chicago is beautiful and it’s very pleasant to walk around.

And of course, I checked out The Bean.

# Chicago November 2024 Trip

# Airport

This time, because it was significantly cheaper, I opted for the 7 AM flight to Chicago instead of the 8 AM one from LAX. Big mistake. Was not worth waking up the extra hour earlier and getting there on time. Would rather sleep in and show up to my flight and destination well rested. Live and learn.

# Flight

# Hotel

Same as my prior trip, I stayed at the JW Marriot. Again, great hotel, luxury brand of the Marriot company. 

# Restaurants

# Qiao Lin Hotpot Downtown Chicago

For dinner the first evening, had Qiao Lin hotpot in Downtown Chicago. The restaurant seems to be going for that upscale / “modern” vibe due to it’s location and proximity in Downtown Chicago.

Hot pot during cold weather just hits different.

We had an assortment of meat along with a bunch of delicious vegetables and sides such as tofu, cabbage, wok chop, shrimp, and more. Sauces were a great add on. For soup base, we chose the mix and match option and had the tomato soup and the herbal chicken based broth. The tomato soup was very flavorful, but the herbal chicken based broth was seasoned too “herby”.

# Venteux

For breakfast the next morning, went to Venteux which is a classic French Cafe. Because the restaurant was busy, we dined at the bar area. It was a nice breakfast consisting of the standard eggs, potatoes, sausage, toast, and coffee.

# Terrace 16

For dinner we went to Terrace 16, which is a restaurant located on the 16th floor of the Trump International Hotel located along the riverwalk. The restaurant has a great view which overlooks the entire Downtown Chicago area along the Riverwalk. Recommended for date nights, business meals, or if you want an elevated dining experience.

For appetizers, we had the half dozen Raw Oysters and the Risotto. The oysters were very fresh and pleasant, paired with great sauces.

For our entrees, we had the Filet Mignon and the Duck Breast. Both were good, but I preferred the Duck Breast over the Filet Mignon.

# Activities

# Art Institute of Chicago

This time, went to the Art Institute of Chicago, which is an Art Museum located in Millennium Park. There were many great exhibits and a combination of American, Greek, European, Asian and more.

Some notable pieces that I thought were interesting at the Art Institute of Chicago:

# A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte – Georges Seurat

# Chrysanthemums – Pierre Auguste Renoir

# Alexander Covering the Body of Darius – Charles Meynier

# The Destruction of Pharoah’s Army – Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg

# The Eruption of Vesuvius – Pierre Jacques Volaire

# Closing Thoughts about Chicago in 2024

Chicago is a great city, very walkable, and many fun things to do. Great place to be, especially when the weather is good. Tons of good restaurants and bars if you’re into that. A city with a metropolitan feel, without the craziness of a metropolitan city such as Los Angeles.

When I travel, I prefer to stay at a nice hotel in a conveniently located area that is walkable and enjoy good food.

Although a little bit is fine, I don’t really need to do too much sightseeing or visit attractions when I travel. Maybe like 1-2X in a day.

I’ve really been enjoying a ton of the traveling that I’ve been doing, with many more trips to be had in the future.

It’s great to develop a high paying skillset to be able to comfortably afford travel.

The world is a big place with many cities to enjoy.

A break from home always recharges me and allows me to come back home ready to tackle on more work.

I’m ready to be able to go to a coffee shop or church without the fear of her needing to nurse, but I’m stuck on positions.

Right now I primarily do cross cradle using a nursing pillow for support. I can’t fathom how to nurse in public without a pillow, especially when she does nurse for such a long time. What positions have worked for you with such a young baby and assuming you’re able to be seated? Also any tips for controlling the leakage from her mouth that still sometimes happens?

1gmou2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/1gmou2c/does_anyone_actually_enjoy_shopping_for_me_its/,Does anyone actually enjoy shopping? For me it’s almost a compulsion followed by guilt ,I don’t want to admit how much I shop even in a space like this among people who understand. There is so much shame and guilt tied into this. I don’t want to do anything else but get a coffee and walk around with some music while looking at shops. It makes me happy and relaxed. Like I’m on a hunt for something great - on the other hand it’s also like a compulsive drug and I’m pulled towards this behavior. Usually I find something I love and I buy it. Sometimes it happens I bring the items home and I decide to return something. I promise myself that I will return it and leave the store but most times I end up exchanging it for something else or buying even more. Yesterday I returned a coat and on the way out I see an employee wearing the cutes sequin top and I fell in love and had to have it. A few hours later I see the same top in black and I haven’t stopped thinking about how I absolutely need it in black too. I know that I won’t stop thinking about it until I get it and I promise myself that it will just be this one item and after that I’m done - I truly believe this to be true but I also know deep down I will fail. What do you guys do that works? I have bipolar 2 and ADHD - it absolutely doesn’t make this any easier ,4,1731088973.0,shoppingaddiction,2,1.0,False

//

I significantly reduced my coffee intake (from daily for several months to once every few days and then to once per week, then to a chai or matcha two times per week) approximately 2 months ago. For reference, I am very sensitive to caffeine (impacts my sinuses, my gut and motility, causes me to break out if I drink it many days consecutively, generally drags my immune system down with consistent consumption, even small amounts) and really shouldn't be drinking it at all (but, addiction...every time I get feeling good again, I think, I can have a cup of coffee...then that eventually turns into me drinking coffee every day again and going through the cycle of having to quit again because I don't feel well). ///  At this point, I have not had any coffee / caffeine (other than small amount of chocolate) for 3 weeks. A few days after I stepped down from daily (2 months back), I started feeling like a cold was coming on -- slightly sore / dry throat, slight sinus irritation (felt really dry), and my eyes felt so tired and more sensitive to light. A week later, those symptoms (sinus, throat) were still around and a new symptom popped up -- the skin around my right eye got red, flaky, puffy, dry. In another week, the right one had improved a bit but now both eyes were having issues. In fact, one day the skin around my eyes looked like it aged 10 years overnight (super dry, flaky, puffy, wrinkly). These symptoms - sinus, throat, eyes - have now lasted for nearly 2 months. They are worst in the morning and right before I go to bed, but are present throughout the day. I've tried changing things in my home environment (already do not use any chemically-scented or colored products, everything I use is gluten-free because I'm allergic to gluten and so many other things). I've had blood panels (CBC w/diff) done multiple times and initially my WBC was low (3.5), my total cholesterol was high (239, LDL too high, HDL decent) and my hemoglobin is still low (not uncommon for me since a young age) but WBC is back within normal range (5.2). I also went to the eye doc to confirm no eye issues / damage, because I was also have vision changes (ability to focus was changing). The verdict was - no damage, but natural aging is occurring and my prescription has changed (I'm 42 yo, so, not uncommon). ///  I'm trying to rule things out at this point, since basic stuff like increasing the humidity in my room and using eye drops and taking days off of eye makeup, throwing all old makeup away, trying different soap, etc. hasn't helped. It's possible I was glutened a few months back, I've just never had a reaction like this, so it seems to me to maybe be more likely related to the coffee than the gluten. I've also had a lot of gut issues (coffee was really messing w/my gut and it's taken time to get it back to normal) over the past 2 months (coincided with quitting coffee and has taken a long time to get back to anything close to normal in terms of motility, bloating, etc.) My next steps is to test kidney function to make sure nothing is off there, because I'm also just generally feeling dehydrated and fatigued frequently (in the past 2 months) despite being vigilant about drinking lots of water, and because more recently I've had mid- to upper back ache/inflammation. Also for reference:  I don't drink or smoke. I eat a lot of greens. I'm a pescatarian. I get a decent amount of sunshine and physical activity (could do better here...I do sit at a desk all day), and about 5 weeks ago (the middle of all of this stuff happening, not the cause), I started working with a trainer to lift weights. I supplement because of the gluten allergy (historic malabsorption) and have had micronutrient levels tested within the past 6 months and overall, they look really good. All to say...I'm living a pretty health lifestyle, I can't draw a direct line from lifestyle to my health issues (primary at present are -- 1) eyes and skin around the eyes, 2) sinus and throat irritation, 3) fatigue, 4) dehydrated tissues overall) and still can't beat these symptoms.  ///  Totally not expecting a diagnosis; included the lab info in case that's helpful.  --- Anyone experience anything like this when they quit coffee?",1,1731088685.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

The Solitude Station Access Pass

Greetings,

The temps are dropping, and the snow is flying…  And we’ve got a new product that gets you first tracks all season long. We couldn’t be more excited to introduce the brand new Solitude Station Access Pass.

Benefits:

Early access to a lounge and gear storage via a dedicated access gate at the base of the Sweetwater Gondola starting at 7:45 AM to access your gear, enjoy a continental breakfast, and hang out in a warm, comfortable environment

First tracks…  All Solitude Station Access Passholders will have access to the Sweetwater Gondola through a dedicated access gate at the mid-station (just outside the lounge) that will allow you to head up to Casper restaurant before the mountain opens. Once Ski Patrol opens the mountain, the rope will drop, and you’ll have early access to the Casper and Teton chairs. If you’ve ever skied any part of this mountain early, you know just how special this is.

Season-long ski, boot, and gear storage in the new Solitude Station Access Pass lounge

Lunch reservations at the new Trapper’s restaurant. The restaurant at Solitude Station, now Trapper’s, is undergoing some major improvements we think you’ll love. More details coming your way soon!

Two complimentary guest passes per season to bring friends or family up to the lounge with you

The continental breakfast: coffee, tea, juice, pastries, bagels, yogurt, granola, etc. available in the lounge

A lounge concierge will bring you your skis, make your Trapper’s lunch reservations, or schedule you a ski or board tune at a JHMR shop.

The lounge remains staffed with a concierge all day, so you can swing in any time to warm up or throw on your slippers before walking over to Trapper’s for lunch.

At the end of the day you can leave your gear, the concierge will store your skis, put your boots on a dryer, and you can download on the Sweetwater Gondola until 5 PM.

In this inaugural year of this pass and its early mountain access, JHMR is selling a limited number of passes…  They’ll go quickly. Pricing is as follows:

Single Pass: $10,000

Couple’s (2 people) Pass: $15,000

Family Pass (up to four people): $20,000

Thank you, as always, for being part of the JHMR family!

We would also really like to see Rio Celeste for a day at some point during our trip if possible. Curious if that is a reasonable day trip from Playa Flamingo to Rio Celeste? Also best routes and road conditions for that drive?

Any other recommendations are welcome, we haven't planned any excursions or day trips yet we figured best to wait until we arrive and go with the flow to embrace the ""pura vida"" way of life.

Where people regret making their choices, whether it's streams, wrong courses, or whole life could be their parent's mistake, I hope you avoid all of those.. \~  
So, first of all, let me introduce myself, my name is XYZ from XYZ city, studying in XYZ school, and I took Arts stream in 11th, as always I thought, I wanted to not run the race run, but would rather join the unemployment rate, So I chose Arts without a doubt in my brain.  
Fast forward to today, and I've meet no person who can tap my shoulder and say, ""You're doing good"" or they won't even ask me. Lmao, they won't even check on me what am I doing in life.. Am I bad with looks? I'm also questioning the answer, but I won't ask you to judge me just from my face. Listen to my back to back stories.  
Back in School, I was a very chill guy, and I mean very very chill enough to give ice a fever, freeze the snow or even warm the cold coffee, even the chocolates were melting from my Aura but...  
I was weak in Maths, I could blame my teachers but I blame myself now for not blaming them but blaming them in secretly but not in a way I'd say, it's a regret that I've holding in my heart. I had more regrets than having multiple girlfriends, I had more regrets than a guy who did B.A (who blames the Govt. that Jobs ain't there, but get skills little bro, no free fund ka nashta for you)  
At the end, who's reading this post, who share the same thoughts as me, who also had fun before but now they are struggling with life, will relate to me and it's life right.. Life was always about being Doctor bano, Engineer, Haa bhai.. doctor bano engineer bano.. Mai sahi bolra hu.. Kuch nhi rkha arts mai.. marr jaoge but ambulance nhi ayegi bachane, bolenge ki Arts wala hai.. Iske jaise toh bohot dekhe hai.. IITian hota toh isko ICU lejate...  
Hence, what's the moral of the story? ( ""Marr jana but arts mat lena.. kasam se bata rha hu easy ke chakkar mai tum bhi apni marwa rhe ho..."" - Like shut up literally)  
Choose wtvr you want, if You choose the hell, live in hell, if you chose Arts, just live with it, you can't waste your 2 years again by repeating but you can waste your whole life.. that's the moral of this rant.

put a trailing stop loss of 6% on each of these

now, each of these bets can at most be a 1% loss of your total

this is within the bounds of proper risk management strategy, where youre only risking 1% (or say 2%, or 0.5%, somewhere around 1%) of your total on each bet.

you can then do up to six different bets at once, or, one bet that you can then enter and exit from up to six times throughout the day, or, you can put several bets at once, and enter and exit any of them several times, however you want to break it up.

in more detail:

i recommend doing ""contingent, one-triggers-a-one-cancels-the-other (OTOCO)"" bets.

the night before, pick out say nine stocks youre interested in for the next day, and open them all, 3x3, in charts across your screen, and have your brokerage account open, then put your computer to sleep this way.

(im on the west coast so here's how i do it with west coast times.)

set your alarm so youll be at your computer at least a few minutes before opening bell.

i set my alarm at 6, make a cup of coffee and flick the news on for a second (to see if the world's blown up- if it has itll be a red day, if not, might be a green day- wars, riots, big accidents, anything like that)

by about 6:25 at my computer for opening bell at 6:30, look at what happened in premarket for a second. ones that have gone up at all in premarket might have action during the day too.

opening bell, i wait to see if any of them drop after the bell, going for a dip play. i buy into those with OTOCO orders:

buy either market if it looks like its at the bottom of its potential dip already, or, if its still going down, i put a buy trailing stop loss order for 1%. this may capture some more downward movement. (also brings risk to 7% for this stock but negligible).

if the stock hasn't dipped in the space of time after the bell, buy into it the same way from there.

for the two sell orders, i put one of them at 6% trailing stop loss. i put the other at a temporary limit price of double what i think the stock might actually do during the day, to give it plenty of room cause i actually want to cinch it down later-

having done however many of these im going to do at open, i now go shower and make breakfast and come back, trying to be back in about half an hour, no more than an hour.

starting at this time you may have some stocks going up, some stocks losing. you may want to start tightening up your bets, and pinching together their parameters- you can replace the trailing stop loss bets of 6% with ones of 1-2%, and you can look from here at what you think a realistic limit to hit from here will be, and then replace your limits to these numbers. then sit back and wait basically or repeat or adjust this process based on performance of stocks.

if youve been betting with your total amount before this, you may have found yourself doing things like making 30% one day, then losing 10% for three days, or four days. this strategy should change you to consistently making like 2%, which, look at that- is an 8-20% gain versus the other strategy over a same time period.

remember to only place these bets on stocks you have edge on- a reason to go up today, of some kind- not ones youre randomly betting on-

and play around with these numbers / divisions / timings, but, something like this.

when all your bets are played for the day, start looking at what you want to bet on tomorrow, another nine stocks or so to look at. 

maybe dont try to spend all your bets within the first couple hours either. 

to resummarize: this strategy is based on picking a one-size-fits-all trailing stop loss by percentage that is just big enough to absorb all normal dips, then, you divide your total amount by this same number and make those your bet sizes, which starts you off at a decent risk management stance of 1% risk to total per bet.

1gmo7om,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1gmo7om/28_m4f_eucz_survived_a_goat_assassination_won/,"28 [M4F] EU/CZ - Survived a goat assassination, won against the evils of technology, all to find you.","I lit the beacons and my dog allies responded, the assassination attempt failed. An electric socket also tried something similar when I was a kid and threw itself at me holding a fork, three times. I might just have the 9 cat lives perk.

I am a certified tech wizard and can work as personal tech support, I get paid in companionship. I dont want kids and or drama in general, no anger issues here and am an avid meme and random internet bullshit lover. Music makes my brain tingle in the best ways and no matter how bad of a movie I watch, if its with someone special to me that movie is the best thing ever.

Am artistic as hell, used for brainstorming and showing concepts to cause I apparently give good ideas. I do random projects for friends cause why not so if you want to see an ad for a coffee shop in unreal engine just ask.

I am pretty sure lord of the rings woke up whatever creativity I had in me and I will never forget being that kid in a corner trying to be as quiet as possible while watching the movie.

Playing a game together is always an option, I am good at just about anything I touch and will never be toxic to you. I laugh a lot and will most likely try to make you laugh too and prefer voice calls more than texting. Movies and shows are always an option no matter how weird it is (looking at you ""serbian film"" you bastard).

I probably missed a bunch of things about me but thats the fun part of talking to someone right? :D So come and make one of the best decisions ever.

PS: I am about 7 cats or three/and a half medium dogs tall.",2,1731087441.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1gmo7a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1gmo7a5/does_my_crush_like_me/,Does my crush like me? ,"I know I sound like a teenager. You see, he and I are in grad school, and I always thought he was cute, but I never thought he was into me like that. I just always have to initiate conversation with him, and there are people he almost prefers talking to. Not to mention, while I’m not the worst looking person, I’m very quiet in class. I’m the quiet kid. 

If it weren’t for his rare moments of kindness, I think he’d hate me. But one time I spilled my coffee all over my desk, and he went to the men’s restroom to get paper towels to clean my desk. Another time, some classmates wanted to go to the farmers market after class. I didn’t want to go because I was really tired. Everybody else was already walking, but he was the only one that waited for me to make a decision.

I invited the whole class to my birthday party. he was the second person to confirm that he was coming to my party. Keep in mind he lives 30 minutes away from me.",2,1731087414.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

1gmo25x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1gmo25x/graduated_38_5/,Graduated 38 + 5,"I thought I peed my pants and was mortified. I had this grand plan of cooking a bit more, cleaning my house a bit more because my MIL decided last minute to travel and visit baby.. but no. Baby came early! My house was messy, it's my busiest time of year at work. I did my best to prep.

FTM here's what I learned:
- the hormones, they just flow. Wow so they flow. I'm a patient person but man, I am irritated by everything at the moment. MIL commented to my daughter that I'm no longer fat! Oy, English is not her first language so I give her grace but as a mother of a new daughter that one enraged me. My MIL also provided commentary on how short my leave is in the US (she was a SAHM- fantastic for her, that's not a reality for me). I am much more short and told her to talk to her son and then corrected her on Canadian leave of absence laws (that's where they live, we're in the US and in in HR). I'm usually much more patient but I've had a c-section, I'm in pain and my baby came early. Also nothing is wrong with daycare, I let her know I went into daycare at 12 weeks and I'm ok. She said she chatted with my mom about this and how that's how it was for recent immigrants. TL;DR, the hormones are real. 
- Pay attention to feeding and loss of birth weight. We gave birth in a really great facility, one of the best in the country I find out afterwards. Having said this, the lactation and pediatrician did not alert us to the percentile of birth weight until my baby's birth weight was in the 10th percentile. We connected with a great lactation consultant at the hospital but I wish I knew to ask about this. On the first day meeting the pediatrician/lactation consultant.
- We had a birth plan. I love plans. I also tried to hold out for epidural as long as possible. I lasted 9 hours, actively pushed for 4 hours and then had an emergency c-section. Man, when I saw the midwife and doula whispering in the corner-- I knew the plan was going out the window. I cried so hard when they told me I needed a c-section. My body did everything right, dilated 10cms without barely any meds, I pushed and had good progress. In the end my potatoe's head was aligned the wrong way. The operation itself is not something I'd fear but if you do need one, just be kind to yourself. Your body will shake uncontrollably and you will need more help after birth to ensure your incision heals. 
- Lastly, I wish I had a frank conversation with my husband regarding what we'll need. I have a really, really great husband. He is taking really good care of us all at the moment. Having said this, I notice that because I was physically getting baby coming, I was a lot more alert to what baby things we should get -- it felt more real. I did hear from him that we were overbuying stuff etc. for baby. I begged him to do a few items asap because we don't know when baby comes. I swear he installed the carseat the night that the baby came, thinking he had a ton of time. When we came home, as he is the caretaker he wanted to know where everything is, naturally - why we didn't have certain things etc. but I wish I had had an honest and open conversation with him asking if he feels prepared to take care of everything if he needs to. I think there's was this false sense of, it'll be fine my wife is here. Not a big deal, Amazon has become our best friend! 
- be honest about what you need from yourself, your spouse, family members. You need tea, coffee, food, ask for it. My MIL kindly made some pregnancy food but it's not my culture or what I'd consider satisfying. I let my husband know that it didn't sound or smell appetizing and that I wouldn't be eating it and asked that he relay this to his Mum kindly, it was really thoughtful! I am learning to ask her to fold baby laundry for example. I also had family members calling me right away, wanting video chat - no sir, you'll wait until we're ready. 
- Highly recommend a Doula, in the US you can use FSA/HSA funds towards doula birth care. Our Doula had a great relationship within the hospital, provided great feedback and acted as a buffer at times to coach me vs team. My IV failed twice and was caught by my doula.
- get a pain comb, they look like a hair comb but are sharper. It really dulled the contraction pain.
- I used a lot of what the hospital provided onsite except the Frida Pari bottle and Friday healing foam (those were really really helpful). I didn't bother with a nightgown, pads etc. I had the nurses refill what was needed. My hospital provided ice maci pads, those really do speed up healing, I'd recommend buying those in case your hospital doesn't provide those. 

You've got this, and more 🏆

1gmo1p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1gmo1p2/i_took_arts_2_years_ago_and_now_i_kinda_kinda/,"I took Arts 2 years ago, and now I Kinda kinda... regret it ","Welcome to the club of regrets!! Where people regret making their choices, whether it's streams, wrong courses, or whole life could be their parent's mistake, I hope you avoid all of those.. \~  
So, first of all, let me introduce myself, my name is XYZ from XYZ city, studying in XYZ school, and I took Arts stream in 11th, as always I thought, I wanted to not run the race run, but would rather join the unemployment race, So I chose Arts without a doubt in my brain.  
Fast forward to today, and I've meet no person who can tap my shoulder and say, ""You're doing good"" or they won't even ask me. Lmao, they won't even check on me what am I doing in life.. Am I bad with looks? I'm also questioning the answer, but I won't ask you to judge me just from my face. Listen to my back to back stories.  
Back in School, I was a very chill guy, and I mean very very chill enough to give ice a fever, freeze the snow or even warm the cold coffee, even the chocolates were melting from my Aura but...  
I was weak in Maths, I could blame my teachers but I blame myself now for not blaming them but blaming them in secretly but not in a way I'd say, it's a regret that I've been holding in my heart. I had more regrets than having multiple girlfriends, I had more regrets than a guy who did B.A (who blames the Govt. that Jobs ain't there, but get skills little bro, no free fund ka nashta for you)  
At the end, who's reading this post, who share the same thoughts as me, who also had fun before but now they are struggling with life, will relate to me and it's life right.. Life was always about being Doctor bano, Engineer, Haa bhai.. doctor bano engineer bano.. Mai sahi bolra hu.. Kuch nhi rkha arts mai.. marr jaoge but ambulance nhi ayegi bachane, bolenge ki Arts wala hai.. Iske jaise toh bohot dekhe hai.. IITian hota toh isko ICU lejate...  
Hence, what's the moral of the story? ( ""Marr jana but arts mat lena.. kasam se bata rha hu easy ke chakkar mai tum bhi apni marwa rhe ho..."" - Like shut up literally)  
Choose wtvr you want, if You choose the hell, live in hell, if you chose Arts, just live with it, you can't waste your 2 years again by repeating but you can waste your whole life.. that's the moral of this rant.

### Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures presents: An Eerie Mystery

S.3, Episode 10: ""An Eerie Mystery""     
     
### **Chapter 3: Shadows of the Past**  

The waters of Lake Erie glimmer beneath a moonlit sky, the gentle lapping of waves against the boat masking the tension that has settled over its occupants. Ollie hums an off-tune sea shanty as he steers toward an unassuming cove, but Mouse’s attention is fixed on the far shore. His ears twitch, catching whispers carried on the wind—soft but insistent, as if the lake itself is murmuring secrets.  

“You feel that?” Mouse asks, breaking the silence.  

Inspector Elephant tightens his grip on the side of the boat. “Feel what?”  

“Something’s watching us.”  

The inspector glances at the horizon, his large eyes scanning for movement. “You’re imagining things.”  

Before Mouse can reply, a sudden chill settles over the boat. Ollie shivers, his jaunty humming cutting off mid-note. The air grows heavy, almost oppressive, and a faint mist begins to rise from the water.  

“Uh, Captain?” Inspector Elephant says, his voice wavering. “This normal?”  

“No,” Ollie Jones answers, his gaze locking onto the figure emerging from the mist.  

A shadow coalesces on the surface of the water, its shape indistinct yet unmistakably humanoid. It hovers a few feet above the waves, its form flickering like a dying flame. Where its eyes should be, twin orbs of pale light shine through the darkness.  

“Flight Engineer Victor Moore,” Mouse whispers, his voice filled with both recognition and dread.  

The shadow tilts its head, as if acknowledging the name. When it speaks, its voice is a hollow echo, layered with pain and accusation. “You should not have come here, Mouse Capone.”  

The inspector stands, his usual composure faltering. “What...what is that thing?”  

Mouse doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, he takes a cautious step forward, steadying himself against the rocking of the boat. “It’s what’s left of him,” he says finally. “Victor Moore—the engineer who brought down the Thresher.”  

Ollie’s eyes widen. “You mean...the guy who cursed the whole crew?”  

“Not exactly,” Mouse replies, his tone grim. “Victor didn’t bring the curse with him. It was put on him—and now, it’s keeping him tethered here.”  

The shadow shifts, its form rippling like disturbed water. “You should have left me to my fate,” it says, its voice thick with regret.  

Mouse takes a step closer, his paws outstretched. “Victor, listen to me. We’re here to put an end to this. But we need your help. Tell us who cursed you.”  

The shadow lets out a low, guttural sound that might be a laugh. “You already know,” it says before vanishing into the mist, leaving the lake eerily calm in its wake.  

### **The Artist’s Café**  

The train’s rhythmic clatter carries the trio from Warsaw to Paris, where the city’s warm glow spills onto cobblestone streets. It’s a jarring contrast to the haunting events on the lake, but Mouse knows better than to let his guard down.  

The café sits nestled in a quiet alley, its interior a mix of bohemian charm and organized chaos. Easels line the walls, canvases propped at odd angles, and the air is thick with the smell of paint and stale coffee.  

Mouse sips his espresso, his ears swiveling to catch snippets of conversation around the room. Ollie, now clad in a Junior Expeditioner badge Mouse whipped up on the train, sits across from him, fidgeting with excitement. The inspector, ever watchful, scans the room for potential threats.  

“You think this is the place?” Ollie whispers.  

Mouse nods. “It’s always the place.”  

Before Ollie can ask what he means, the café door slams open, and a burly cat with scars crisscrossing his face strides in. His eyes lock onto Mouse immediately.  

“Well, well,” the cat purrs, his voice dripping with menace. “Look what the wind blew in.”  

Mouse groans. “Just once, I’d like a quiet meeting.”  

The cat doesn’t waste time on pleasantries. With a sharp whistle, two more figures appear—each as rough-looking as their leader. Chairs scrape back, and the café’s patrons scramble for the exits.  

“You’ve got a lot of nerve showing up here,” the cat says, advancing on Mouse.  

“And you’ve got a lot of nerve interrupting my coffee,” Mouse replies, casually leaning back in his chair.  

The tension snaps like a rubber band, and the brawl begins. Mouse moves with practiced ease, ducking punches and using his tail to trip one of the goons. Ollie, to his credit, grabs a baguette from a nearby table and wields it like a sword, shouting, “En garde!”  

The inspector, though less agile, proves equally effective, his sheer size enough to send one of the attackers sprawling.  

Amid the chaos, Mouse spots a figure in the corner—young, unassuming, and eerily familiar. It’s Victor Moore, or rather, an ageless version of him.  

Mouse freezes, momentarily distracted, and narrowly avoids a fist aimed at his head. “Victor?” he calls out, his voice cutting through the din.  

The young man smiles faintly, then slips out the door.  

### **The Mission Assigned**  

The fight ends as quickly as it began, with Mouse and his team slipping out the back before the authorities arrive. They find Victor waiting in a nearby alley, his expression calm.  

“I didn’t expect to see you here,” Mouse says.  

Victor shrugs. “I’ve been...waiting.”  

“For what?”  

“For you,” Victor replies. “To finish what was started.”  

Mouse narrows his eyes. “The curse. It’s tied to you, isn’t it?”  

Victor nods. “And if you want to break it, you’ll need someone to infiltrate the one who cast it.” His gaze shifts to Ollie.  

The bear cub blinks. “Me?”  

“You’re the only one who can do it,” Victor says. “They won’t see you coming.”  

Mouse hesitates, glancing at Ollie. “This isn’t what you signed up for.”  

“It’s fine,” Ollie says, his voice steady. “Junior Expeditioner, remember? I’m ready.”  

Mouse sighs, then extends a paw. “Alright, Captain Jones. Your first mission.”  

Ollie's determination is unshakable. Victor hands him a small, intricately carved key. “This will get you close,” he says. “The rest is up to you.”  

The chapter ends with Mouse watching Ollie walk away, the weight of the mission pressing heavy on them all. Above them, the Eiffel Tower looms, its lights casting long shadows on the city below.  ",1,1731086929.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

I am looking for a winter perfume and last week I was about to walk into Ulta and pick up a bottle of Black Opium until I started looking for more of a frankincense forward floral smell and came across this subreddit. I know absolutely nothing about perfume but I was intrigued by Solstice because I do buy indie cosmetics on occasion. RIP Meow Cosmetics.

I placed an order last night and I'm super excited. I only did EDPs because she says the longevity is better and I got:

Scrying Smoke, Patches &
Private Eye

I kind of regret the Private Eye because I'm thinking it's going to be very masculine and I may end up donating it to my husband. 

I saw so many frankincense forward perfumes in the catalog but settled on Scrying Smoke because I wanted a sweet/spice combo.

How did I do? Any other suggestions for the churchy or Egyptian Queen sort of smell that doesn't smell super hippie?

I'm not sure what I like honestly, but for summer I typically wear Clinique Happy or La Vie Est Belle because I like the light citrus and then Black Opium or Burberry Brit for Her for a heavier winter scent. 

So I guess I like florals with citrus or honey/fruit, coffee and sort of rich boozy scents but nothing super far into gourmand land as in smelling like a baked good...

I'm super interested in Russian Caravan and Smokewood Apiary but they were out of stock. Sort of interested in Sea of Grey because I've smelled so many gross aquatic smells in the past but if I legitimately smelled like the seaside I think I would like it.

Sorry for the rambling post but does anyone have any suggestions for my next order? I fully intend to try a lot of the samples.

We all get to leave work early today. Me and some other new hires are getting together with some of our coworkers to better get to know each other. Where are we meeting up?

“Let’s go for drinks down the road.”

For context, I have a breathalyzer in my car. I drove to work, so there’s no way I could even consider the idea of it. I haven’t told many people about my history, let alone about my car and device, and wasn’t about to start. But I didn’t even consider the option of drinking because….I didn’t want to. I didn’t feel like it. In fact, as we were sitting around the table - when they ordered beers and I got myself a coffee - I actually felt proud that I didn’t even want to drink. I had no remote inkling. This is nuts to me because recently that’s been my biggest hurdle to overcome with sobriety: not wanting to drink when others are.

I think today is a huge step for me. I actually feel proud and honoured to say that I’m sober. I want to keep it that way.

This is the best I have felt in a while, and the proudest I have felt of myself for years.

Morning light blasted through my blinds, waking me.

I had only been asleep for a couple hours.

My fingers trembled as I plugged the USB memory card into my laptop, dreading what I’d see. The screen flickered, and I clicked on the file, reliving last night’s nightmare in grainy footage. It was worse than I remembered. 

The headlights in my rearview mirror were like eyes, unblinking and menacing. Even with the dash cam, I couldn’t make out his face. 

He stayed in the shadows, his features blurred. But the truck clicked in my mind, a blue Ford F-150, like my uncle’s. Old, but distinct. No license plate… but not terribly unique.

If I could find that truck, I might find him.

Later, I sat in the Meridian Police Department. In Officer Daniels’ office. He handed me back the USB drive and sat back behind his desk.

Officer Daniels barely glanced at his monitor, the footage before smirking. “Look,” he said, leaning back, “you’re a pot stirrer. Maybe even harassing locals.”

“Harassing locals?” I snapped. “That guy followed me off the road last night. He fucking sprinted at my car! At me!”

Daniels raised an eyebrow. “It’s a blurry video of headlights and a truck. Maybe Eddie Baker thought you were in trouble.”

“Eddie Baker?” My heart skipped a beat.

“Yeah, Eddie Baker,” Daniels sighed. “His granddaddy was Edward Baker, old gold refiner. Eddie’s rough around the edges, sure, but that don’t make him a criminal.” 

He gave me a thin smile. 

“Drop this before you find yourself in a big pot of cream you can’t churn out of.”

As soon as I left the station, I called my friend Ryan, telling him about Eddie and the police’s reaction. When I finished, he went silent.

“Do you have any idea how reckless you’re being?” Ryan finally said. “You’re out there alone, chasing a potential killer, someone who probably knows you’re looking for him.”

“I’m not doing this for fun. This fucker might have taken Maggie.”

“And he might take you next!” He snapped. “I’m coming over with pepper spray and a gun.”

“I don’t need a gun,” I insisted, though my voice wavered. “I just need proof.”

He groaned but didn’t argue further. 

“You’re in over your head.”

That night, I ate a big bowl of pho while I just Googled for hours. Looking for anything about the Baker family, but I just kept hitting dead ends. All old, unhelpful articles.

Almost nothing about Eddie. Was that even his name?

And worse…

I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. Every creak in the house made me jump. 

And then it happened, a loud crash shattered the silence. 

My heart stopped.

I dropped my phone and ran to the living room, where shattered glass lay scattered across the floor. In the center of the room was a brick, coated in something dark. 

Next to it, lying in a pool of blood, was a severed lamb’s head. Its lifeless eyes stared at me, mouth twisted in a gruesome snarl. A note pinned to its forehead, smeared in red letters.



***I KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU*** 

***THAN YOU KNOW ABOUT ME***

***CUNT***



I stood there, numb with shock. 

I stumbled backwards, nearly tripping over the glass, to grab my phone. My hands shook as I called Ryan, panic seeping into my voice.

“Ryan, I… bring over the gun,” I stammered, eyes fixed on the grotesque scene. “He knows. He knows I’m looking for him.”

I FaceTimed Ryan, showing him the scene.

“Stay where you are,” Ryan replied, his voice tense but steady. “I’ll be there in ten minutes. Don’t touch anything, and don’t go near the windows.”

\*\*\*\*

The events of the previous night looped in my mind like a horror film.

The severed lamb’s head, the blood, the note. It all felt unreal, but the shattered window and the lingering stench of blood kept reminding me it was.

I didn’t sleep. Not really. 

I sat in my living room with Ryan by my side, his gun lying between us on the coffee table. The curtains were pulled tight, leaving the room in a gloom that matched my mood. 

Ryan was still asleep on the couch, his arm draped protectively over his face, but I couldn’t stay still any longer. My anger and fear wouldn’t let me. Eddie knew about me, and he wanted me scared. He wanted me to stop, but I wouldn’t.

I needed answers. 

Not just for Maggie but for myself. If I was in danger anyway, there was no reason to stop now.

Quietly, I picked up my laptop and continued digging. Most of what I found was useless. Random mentions of Eddie’s grandfather, Edward, and old mining operations. 

But one article stood out: a small mention of a hunting lodge deep in the mountains, land that had belonged to the Baker family for decades.

Ryan stirred awake, yawning. He blinked, then sat up when he saw me on the laptop. “You’re not still…” His voice trailed off when he saw my face.

“I’m going out there,” I said, pointing at the screen, my eyes locked on the article. “The hunting lodge. If he’s hiding something, it’s there.”

“You’re insane.” Ryan rubbed his face, his eyes still bleary. “Do you even hear yourself? You believe he’s the crazy dude who threw a severed lamb’s head through your window, and now you want to walk right into his territory?”

“You don’t have to come.” 

Ryan sighed heavily, shaking his head. 

“You know I’m not letting you go alone.” He grabbed the gun off the table and checked it, making sure it was loaded. “But if we do this, we need a real plan. No rushing in blindly.”

My heart pounded in my chest, adrenaline surging through me at the thought of confronting Eddie. Part of me was terrified, but another part… the part that refused to let Maggie’s memory be tarnished by inaction… was ready.

We spent the next few hours gathering what we needed. Flashlights, extra phone chargers, snacks, and a map of the area. 

Ryan insisted we stop by his dad’s place on the way out. 

His dad was a retired private investigator, the type who had more surveillance gadgets than the NSA. Ryan came back with a box of cameras and trackers.

“If the coast is really clear, we can mount some of these on his property,” he explained as he packed them into the trunk.

We drove for a couple hours, the city giving way to open country, and then dense, winding forest roads. The deeper we went, the less civilization seemed to exist. The sky above turned from clear blue to overcast gray, and soon, mist began to gather between the trees, thick and damp.

Finally, we turned down a narrow, overgrown path, barely wide enough for Ryan’s truck. The hunting lodge loomed ahead, a dark silhouette against the backdrop of endless trees. It looked abandoned, the kind of place that held a hundred secrets, none of them good. The windows were dark, the roof sagging in places, and an eerie silence hung over the clearing.

We parked a good distance away, hidden behind a thick line of trees. 

Ryan killed the engine, and for a moment, we just sat there, staring at the lodge. My pulse pounded in my ears, and my mouth felt dry.

“Last chance to back out,” Ryan said, his voice barely a whisper.

I shook my head. I was ready. 

We moved cautiously, staying low, making our way toward the lodge. The air was thick with tension, every snapped twig underfoot making me flinch. We reached the side of the building, and Ryan motioned for me to stay back as he peered through one of the grimy windows.

The lodge was empty. So was the land. 

It was eerie.

“Alright, quick, quick,” Ryan said, pulling out some of the surveillance cameras. 

I ran over to him and knelt down, mirroring what he was doing, unwrapping the cables that were taught around the cameras.

Ryan was looking at the cabin. At the area around for good spots.

“Three should work,” he said.

“Where?” I asked.

“Two in front. One in the back.”

Ryan got up with one of the cameras in his hands. Started to walk off.

“Where are you going?” I asked.

I knew he was going around back to hide the camera somewhere inconspicuous. But the truth is I was afraid to be alone at that moment.

He pointed to the creek behind the cabin, but it was too late.

I've recently graduated college and moved to a new city where I don't know anyone in besides my roommate. I don't really like going out as a way to meet people because it's more of a place to go have fun with people you already know. Besides, you can't hear people talk in bars and clubs so that's out of the question in my mind. Almost everyone I work with is cool but they're all married with children and mostly hang out with other married couples with children so that's kind of out. And the few people I do hang out with from work I feel like I have to still be kind of corporate around them and not entirely myself if you know what I mean. Also means I haven't fully separated personal like from work life which is always a priority of mine. Definitely desire to have a friend group separate from work if possible.

I've seen folks mention coffee shops before but everyone just kinda does work at the coffee shops I've checked out lol. Doesn't seem like a pro-social environment. I've seen folks mention church groups but I'm not religious and don't want to pretend to be in order to join these groups.

Idk, I've found fun things to do where I'm at but I've mostly had to do them by myself or with my roommate if he's not working.

Yep, suddenly be nothing after talking about everything. Trying to desensitize myself to these instances as I don't think it has happened enough.

We'll talk like we've met before and keep on talking as if we'll meet again, but we have never and will never meet and that's ok.

We'll enjoy a short burst of information exchange to keep us sane for a while.

Not in PH right now.
Not pure Pinoy but can speak Tagalog well.
Will say it right now: I'm half Indian (but a whole lot more Pinoy than my Indian half).

Though I bet you guys would keep on talking if I was <Insert conventionally good looking Western or other Asian ethnicity>. Sorry, had to vent this out because this hurts more than being suddenly ghosted after long, deep talks.

Can talk coffee brewing, movies, anime, existence, recent spike in public interest in UAPs (I know, it's giving Okarun), fitness, dreams of restarting life as a dishwasher and eventually making it as a successful chef, under the religious definitions for God (omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, omnibenevolent) which scientifically observable force/phenomena would qualify as God: Light, Gravity, or something else?

So I'm moving to coarser, and it gets better, but I'm now already at size 3.1 and I'm still at 50 seconds for ~32ml espresso.
When I was grinding manually I had the perfect sweet spot at around 25-30 s, so I don't think it's that I'm pressing the puck too much. When I was at size 2 it felt like it was choking (ore infusion would start, then extraction starts but stops after 3-5 seconds and nothing happens unless I press the button again. But then I get double water and still only slowly drips out).

So: should I keep grinding coarser until it gets right? Or is something wrong with my Dedica? 🤔

“Akagi,” Kaga radioed her sister’s aircraft as the first hints of dawn began to color the eastern horizon with a soft purple glow. Beneath them was the western Mediterranean, dark as obsidian glass. The brown-tailed kitsune responded calmly.

“I brought some of Soryuu’s tea with me and I am conserving my energy. You need not nag,” she replied with an almost necessary dig at her adoptive sister. Kaga snorted.

“I’m pleased to hear we will not all drop into that cold, dark sea below unannounced, Akagi. But that’s not why we are speaking. You should know that I intend to deploy approximately two hundred kilometers from Toulon, along with most of the destroyers. My aircraft will be right behind your flight, armed.”

Akagi simpered at the emphasis Kaga placed on the last word. “You wound me, Kaga. What is it you think I intend to do?”

Kaga glanced behind her to where Eldridge was curled up like a cat in the B5N cockpit’s second seat. The little girl’s dreaming face softened her expression slightly. “I don’t know, and that’s what worries me. Let the rest of us handle the heroics.”

“I will deliver to our Shikikan what he’s asked for, and nothing less. You would do well to follow my lead,” Akagi sniped back before cutting the channel with the excuse that she needed to conserve energy. Kaga rested her head back against her unforgiving seat and exhaled slowly. 

“I already followed your lead once, Akagi, and look where it got us. I suppose I have no choice but to pray that his direction is enough to deliver you from your own worst impulses. It doesn’t matter how many tails each of us have if we’re dead.”

“Mama, up?” Eldridge mumbled in her sleep, causing Kaga to fall silent so as not to disturb her. After a moment she whispered.

“No sweetie, not up. Down.”

\-----

“Those gods damned, good for nothing, pasta gobbling, wine swilling idiots! Do they have any idea how absurd it is to require direct approval from Sardegna high command for every single engagement? By the time they pull their heads out of their asses the battle for Toulon is going to be over!” Deutschland fumed from the prow of her ship, its Siren-augmented plating reflecting the early morning sun. “And damn those Ugly Sisters too. What the hell are they trying to pull, starting up a war with the Vichya without so much as a ‘how do you do?!’ I haven’t had to stress my engines like this since Norway!”

Memories of the cold waters of the Baltic returned to the fore of the pocket battleship’s mind, and she gripped the handle of her sawed-off shotgun. It was comforting to her, a piece of her rigging she kept on her person at all times even after the rebellion and execution of her kommandants. The young woman hung her head. “And after I get there, crush the Templar, and we win this war then what? Spee is gone. Führer Bismarck is gone. My crew is dead or gone. Am I doing this for the Empress’ approval?”

The sky and sea held no answer to her questions. All she had left was her cubes and their drive to dominate and conquer. She wasn’t sure if it made any sense when she had no one she cared about to share her victories with, but it was a lot better than sitting at port in Corsica and waiting for something to happen in the Mediterranean. Thanks to Gniesenau and Scharnhorst, a great many things were suddenly happening all at once. She shook her head so violently her cap almost flew off, clearing her mind for the task ahead. “Might as well get this over with now while I have the space and sea for it. What was it the Empress said again? Surrender yourself to the key?”

A spine-chilling shudder ran through her body as Deutschland focused on her Siren-augmented form, the disorienting pull from her mechanical hands and tail eventually reaching her cubes and resonating with something just beyond her comprehension that made her want to gag. There was great power in it though and she pushed through, envisioning all she would need for a successful assault on Toulon: troop ships and landing craft, battleships for shore bombardment, a carrier for air support, destroyers for screening and cover, and a host of soldiers at her beck and call to occupy and hold the city while the flesh and blood armies of the Wehrmacht slowly came to life in the wake of the Allied assault on Casablanca. “Open up, Mirror Sea.” 

At her command, sickly shimmering portals opened all around her hull as the reinforcements she summoned emerged into that particular plane of existence. The ships’ designs bore little to no resemblance to mankind’s modern shipbuilding sensibilities, black hulls with sharp angles and glowing blue markings throughout. A flattop with two runways formed the center of the formation, Siren VTOL aircraft already prepared to sortie. The carrier was surrounded by six battleships that featured one forward-facing, super-heavy main battery each. They were smaller and sleeker than any terran equivalent, and completely unreliant on propellant-based ammunition. Accompanying the capital ships were two dozen escort craft from heavy cruisers to destroyers, with an equal number of troop transports bringing up the rear. 

“Damn, that takes a lot out of you,” Deutschland gasped, having fallen to one knee from the strain of tapping into the trans-dimensional armory. It was to be expected. She was a kansen, not a Siren. Even with her augmentations she was hardly the Empress’ equal. What she’d not expected, however, were the five white-haired, blue-eyed, scantily-clad figures that appeared behind her on deck. She spun, gun drawn to meet them, but they didn’t so much as flinch. The one with a black cloak and headphones spoke. 

“Siren model Strategist Mark Two awaiting your command.”

It and the others knelt before her, bowing their heads in unison. Whatever they were, the Ironblood kansen was willing to bet they were not capable of independent action. “What are you?”

“We are Executor-class Siren units,” said another, a young woman with a holographic visor over her right eye, waist-length hair, and a synthetic white leotard. “Observer Alpha and the Arbiter of this timeline, Empress, have authorized our deployment for operations outside of Mirror Seas and simulacrums such as the Chessboard Protocol. We exist to ensure optimal performance of Siren weaponry and the success of your operation. Siren model Breaker Mark Two awaiting your command.”

The Ironblood heavy cruiser scrutinized them for a short while before holstering her sawed-off. “I guess I’m stuck with you lot then. Fine. Our target is the Orthodoxy naval facilities at Toulon, where the Black Templar fleet has been held hostage for months. Primary objective is capture of the fleet and the facilities intact. If that proves unworkable, destroy them.”

“And the city itself?” asked the Executor with twintails and a large, shield-like plate on the left side of her head. Deutschland shrugged.

“What would killing the defenseless prove? Eliminate those who resist, ignore the rest. Leave the mess of occupying the city to the Wehrmacht.”

“Very good, kansen Deutschland. It shall be-” Strategist’s confirmation of her orders was cut off suddenly, the humanoid siren construct shuddering for a moment as her eyes flashed brightly. The Ironblood frowned but didn’t intervene. “Kansen Deutschland, the Empress would speak with you.”

The heavy cruiser cocked a brow as Strategist reached for the brooch of her cloak. It activated, exposing its nature as a communications device and holographic projector. A life-size hologram of the Empress looked down at Deutschland. “I expected one of the Sisters. What are you up to, Deutschland?”

“Figures you’d need me to tell you since no one seems to tell anyone anything these days. Maybe clean up your damn comms protocols before bothering me,” the kansen scoffed. Empress frowned.

“You do understand I can revoke your ability to use the Mirror Seas at any time in any place, right? Say, perhaps, in the middle of a protracted battle with Commander Thorson of the Union?” she warned with narrowed eyes. 

“Is that name supposed to mean something to me? Whether they told you about it or not, Gniesenau and Scharnhorst took the initiative against the Orthodoxy in Africa. The damn Sardegnians are sipping espresso and doing fuck all, as always. So it falls to me to capture or destroy the Black Fleet before it can mobilize in response,” Deutschland explained impatiently. Empress crossed her arms over her ample chest, but her disciplinary expression shifted to one of approval.

“Mmm, is that so? It’s a rather inspired maneuver, especially from a kinky brute like you, Deutschland. I swear, you and your sister never turn out similar no matter what I do.”

“Shut up!” Deutschland roared, swiftly drawing her weapon and leveling it at the hologram’s head. “Just let her rest in peace, you monster. This conversation is over!”

“It is not over,” Empress said coldly, waving her hand. To Deutschland’s left, out to sea, a large portal opened. The interior looked much like those connecting to Mirror Seas, but the exterior was wreathed in flame. From it emerged the prow of an unknown class of ship, accompanied by three mechanical, draconic heads.

“Those are… those are 38cm guns! But that hull isn’t Führer Bismarck or Lord Tirpitz. Explain yourself!” Deutschland demanded as the battlecruiser of unknown make fully materialized and sailed silently into formation,its hull reinforced with Siren plating just as hers was. “And what’s with the serpents? It looks like a hydra!”

Empress’ self-assured cackling made it clear that she was only entertaining the question because she wanted to, the woman sweeping her arms wide in a grand gesture. “May I introduce your superior, Deutschland. Behold the first O-class battlecruiser, of this timeline at least. I’ve named her Brünhilde, and this will be her first operation. If all goes well, I intend to place her in command of the western Mediterranean. But she’s still lacking in, what would you say, practical knowledge? Be a good girl and show her the ropes, would you? You two will be working closely together if you survive. Ta ta now!”

Deutschland licked her lips as she scowled, tasting salt. Stepping forward, she reached out with a hand and pressed one of her metallic, clawed fingers against Strategist’s brooch until it cracked and finally shattered. “You five say you’re here to obey my orders on her authorization?”

“That’s correct,” the siren women confirmed as one, the monotone chorus of their voices giving her chills. 

“Then leave me and report to your stations. We will be within striking range of the coast before long.”

With a silent nod the Siren constructs did just that, each of them vanishing and presumably reappearing aboard the lead ship of their element. Deutschland winced as the ‘new girl’ hailed her on all Ironblood channels.

“Good morning, sister Deutschland. It’s an honor to fight beside one of the original revolutionaries. I await your orders,” Brünhilde said. Her voice was loud, too full of energy, too martial, and too perversely pure. 

“You may have been created by the Sirens, but you haven’t been touched by them, not like we’ve been,” the heavy cruiser muttered to herself before clearing her throat and replying. “In the future you need only use one or two channels at most. I’d prefer to not have my ears blown out right before an operation. We’re heading for Toulon to suppress, capture, or destroy the Black Fleet of the Templars, an Orthodoxy kansen faction. I don’t like the idea of turning over part of this job to an untested nobody like you, but at least you’re kansen instead of whatever the hell those Sirens are. You will lead the heavy escorts into battle, standard carrier group formation. If necessary, we will bombard the coastal defenses.”

Brünhilde’s reply came in the same voice as her first message, unchanged despite Deutschland’s dismissive words and frustrated tone. “As you command, sister. I will take point and prove myself this day. The Templar will surrender or die!”

“Yes yes, how very dramatic,” Deutschland dismissed her, killing the line before opening up communications with her submarines. It was a channel only they knew to use, the sort of precaution one had to take when the eyes of the Empress seemed to be everywhere and nowhere. “410, 73, 81, do you read me?”

“We’re here, Deutschland. What the hell is going on up there? And why are we heading northwest? 410 said she spotted Ark Royal south of here, at Algiers! If she’s still alive I need to sink her again!”

Deutschland smirked and shook her head. “I should have whipped 410 for craving action and interfering in the Sisters’ territory. They were given Africa by the Empress and whether we like it or not, that’s that. Nor have they reached out to us about the ongoing operation. That said, the information you came home with was worth more than however many ships or transports you might have taken pot shots at, 410. If things work out well today, we may have time to get in touch with Gniesenau and see if we can’t settle some old scores. Don’t think for a moment I don’t want to be there to kill the woman responsible for the Führer’s death, since she apparently survived her ship’s sinking. But for now we need to focus on penning the Templars in at Toulon and cutting off the head of this snake before it can bite us. And speaking of snakes, each of you should surface enough to get a good look at our new guest from periscope depth. Apparently the Empress has been going over old shipyard plans in her spare time and imbuing them with cubes. If that Brünhilde girl wavers for even a moment, sink her. 73, you have command for this mission.”

“Roger that, boss!” came the reply from the U-boat. “I’m just glad to be out in the open ocean rather than stuck at port waiting for something to happen. Shame she couldn’t have warped Eugen or someone else to us, eh?”

The heavy cruiser paced her deck slowly, a finger to her ear. It didn’t actually help with signal strength, but it was comforting and a force of habit. “A shame indeed. I want one of you on that O-class at all times and the other two on the flanks. We dominate below the waves and the Black Templar aren’t supposed to have any submarines, but I’m not taking any chances. Use the standard channel for tactical comms from here out. Radio this one if you suspect anything from Brünhilde or the Sirens. Deutschland out.”

With all forces accounted for and orders given, there was little to do but sail, wait, and appreciate the sea and sky to the extent she could. Every day it became harder to do so, thinking about what had happened to the Kriegsmarine over the course of the war. “Together we broke our bonds and slaughtered our zookeepers, so she split us up and scattered us to the winds. Eugen, Tirpitz, Spee, Zeppelin… so many others went *missing*. Did we just trade one master for another?” she spat, thinking of all the Ironblood kansen who had ended up KIA or MIA. “At least I’m still alive. And at least that Empress lets me hold the whip.”

\-----

“Did you not hear what I said? The Ironblood attacked us! The Union and Royal Navy were moving for North Africa en masse when I left. There is no time to deliberate or wait for orders! Sacre bleu, the Dominion is at war!” Le Malin exclaimed, doing her best to remain calm. She had made the sprint from Casablanca to Toulon in record time, just over one day, and the rapier-wielding destroyer still had the bags under her eyes to prove it. Despite her appearance she was anything but tired as she attempted to reason with the stoic, unyielding Strasbourg and the ever inscrutable Mogador. “I don’t care if your little birds have heard of it or not. I’m telling you, straight from the lips of Knight Captain Jean Bart herself! We need to make ready the fleets.”

“And do you have any evidence to prove this?” Strasbourg asked Malin, her chin resting on a hand as she reclined on the cello-shaped central piece of her regal, ivory rigging. “Photographs, transcripts, official missives?”

“There wasn’t any time!” Malin insisted, her tiny hands balled into fists at her side as she stood before them in an auxiliary wing of Toulon’s Notre Dame de la Seds cathedral. Mogador cackled maniacally.

“Not even a scrap of parchment with her scrawl?! You expect us to violate the treaty with Ironblood that we worked so hard for, that’s proven so profitable for us, on your word alone? I think the desert heat may have fried your brain, Malin. But you certainly are crazy for wasting our time in such a manner, and I *like* crazy,” the busty, barely clothed destroyer mentioned with narrowed, predatory eyes.

“And I see time ashore hasn’t remedied your malaise. Have you found the rest of your armor yet?” Malin shot back, tongue sharp as her poisoned weapon’s point. Mogador kicked her feet and held up a hand, showing off the greaves and gauntlets she wore along with nothing more than a massive, tattered black cloth. Strasbourg fired a blank from one of her rigging’s turrets to restore silence to the trio.

“If the two of you wish to… play, do so away from prying eyes. We will send a missive to our networks and remain vigilant, but the Tribunal will not act on such little evidence, Malin. The fleet will remain at dock. We cannot risk a full scale conflict on your word alone. Dupleix will see you back to your berth. This meeting is concluded. Go and enjoy the morning sun. It’s a beautiful day,” the elder advised. Le Malin bit her tongue as Mogador’s eyes raked over her. What retribution could she possibly promise if Jean were missing or, even worse, dead? True to Strasbourg’s words the head scribe of the order, Dupleix, awaited her on the steps of the cathedral. 

“I see the audience did not proceed as you wished. I am sorry,” the well-endowed heavy cruiser told Malin, looking at her over her glasses. Her uniform was immaculate as always and, in Malin’s opinion, still absurdly lewd.

“That mole on your left breast is new. You’ve enjoyed the Mediterranean sun a bit too much in my absence I think,” Malin replied as the two of them began the short walk back to the docks through the city’s streets. They had, to that point, been spared the ravages of war. Children still played in them, and old men still enjoyed a coffee in the city’s cafes. “Sorry, Dupleix. That was uncharitable of me.”

The blushing woman stifled a cough and nodded her head. “The attention from the sailors is nice, though I’ve been too busy and shy to ever take one up on an offer. There is nothing to forgive, Malin. I’m sure you are most disappointed, to say nothing of the news about l’Audacieux.”

“She is a strong knight, maybe the best of the Fantastique class. If anyone can survive the Ironblood occupation of Tunisia, it’s her,” Malin insisted, finding hope preferable to despair as their heels clacked on the cobblestone. “But I don’t know what to do now. The Tribunal may not be willing to act but that doesn’t change reality!”

“Then find someone who will. That seems the logical next step, no?” Dupleix suggested. Her tone was academic, words born of pure rationality rather than conspiracy. Malin looked up at her in surprise, but seized on the idea.

“Dupleix, would you mind showing me to Algérie’s berth instead? I’ve been so harried since leaving Casablanca I never got the chance to speak to her after I arrived,” the destroyer said. The scribe was happy to oblige.

“Of course, Malin. Let’s make a right here then. She’s moored at the western end of the docks.”

The two kansen went on their way, circling around the sheltered harbor where the Templar fleet sat at dock. Judging by the reactions of the townspeople and sailors, Malin concluded that all parties had become far too comfortable with the arrangement. She was soon tired of turning down propositions from young men, and wondered just how many of them had been successful in the past. She was saved from having to draw her rapier as she approached the berth of a heavy cruiser, its kansen having watched the two of them approach from her deck. With a leap she crashed to the docks below, heavy mace in hand. “Charles, if I catch you so much as looking at either of them again I will throw you into the brine where you shall remain until there’s not a single barnacle left on my hull!”

Those threatening words were backed up by a figure of imposing presence, the heavy Vichya cruiser Algérie. She opened her arms wide and embraced Le Malin like a long lost sister. “I’d heard you were sent here to join us! What was so important you had to race off to the Tribunal, little one?”

“I’ll be on my way,” Dupleix bowed to them both before summoning her rigging and skating off across the still waters of the harbor. Malin hugged Algérie tightly before stepping back and looking up into the kansen’s bright purple eyes.

“You remind me of some of the native women in Casablanca,” Malin said approvingly, having grown used to men and women alike with bronzed skin and jet black hair. Algérie rested against her mace and laughed.

“You didn’t happen to bring any of them along with you, did you? I’m plenty tired of being the ‘exotic African beauty’ on the base,” she groused, though not with any particular hatred in her voice. Malin shrugged.

“Take it up with the cubes and your hull then, Algérie. Seems only reasonable to me that you would resemble the warriors of the desert rather than fair-skinned women like the rest of us. But we have no time for pleasantries,” the destroyer insisted, glancing all about her to ensure no one was listening. She hoped the sounds of the dockyard would conceal her words. “Rommel and the Ugly Sisters have attacked our colonial holdings in Africa. The Union and Royal Navy sent an invasion fleet. Jean stayed behind to defend Casablanca and sent me ahead. We need to mobilize the fleets immediately! The Ironblood will never leave us be if hostilities have begun again.”

Algérie cocked an ebony brow at Malin before turning her head to glance over her right shoulder. She focused on the spire of the Cathedral for a moment, a frown dominating her features. “And the Tribunal?”

“Claimed they cannot act without evidence, and that my word isn’t sufficient,” Malin responded with acid on her lips. “But I know what the soldiers told us, and I trust Jean. Algérie, please!”

The muscled warrior crossed her arms over her bosom, her strength just making itself known under cloak and revealing uniform. Algérie closed her eyes and breathed deeply. “You’re sure, Malin?”

The lithe destroyer drew her rapier and held it at ceremonial salute, hand over her breast and its blade upward towards God. With her free hand she made the sign of the cross over her body. “I swear on the Lord.”

Algérie nodded, summoned her rigging and placed a finger to her temple. “Dunkerque, it’s me. Yes, I know I’m on *that* channel. Summon all of the destroyer fleet. Do not let the Tribunal know. I will rally the cruisers. Meet us at Saint Joseph’s… and wear your full plate.”

\-----

Monday morning found the Church of Saint Joseph almost empty, save for one kansen from the Black Fleet, Kersaint. Dressed in her customary black bodysuit and white habit, the young woman knelt in the front pews, close to the altar, and observed her morning prayers. She was interrupted by the sound of the church doors opening, followed by the clash of metal boots against stone, the rattling of axes and swords against their sheaths, and the jingling of chainmail. Standing, she turned to find Dunkerque and Algérie in full plate armor, their Templar tabards displayed proudly overtop. Joining them were the cruisers Foch, Marseillaise, and Galissonnière. The heavy cruiser wore a lighter suit of chainmail that better suited her partially ranged battle style, but the light cruisers were both in full armor. Behind them were seven destroyers, Malin, l’Indomptable, Fleuret, Tartu, Vauquelin, Mars, and Épée. Seeing the latter carrying her heavy metal slab of a sword struck fear into Kersaint as Algérie approached. Notably missing were Strasbourg, Mogador, and the Tribunal’s scribe Dupleix. “C-Captain, what is the meaning of this?”

Algérie removed her helmet and managed a smile for the destroyer. “The Knight Captain calls us to war, Kersaint. We are here to seek the Lord’s blessing, and to know His truth.”

Dressed in light plate and leather under her tabard, Malin met Kersaint’s gaze and bowed pleadingly. The priestess of the Templar Order opened her arms and bade them to kneel. The warriors did so, genuflecting and bowing their heads to the pommels of their weapons, helmets held under their arms. Turning to the altar Kersaint dropped to her knees, clasped her hands together, and prayed.

“May the grace of the Holy Spirit be present with us. May Mary, Star of the Sea, lead us to the harbor of salvation. Amen.

Lord Jesus, Holy Father, eternal God, omnipotent, omniscient Creator, Bestower, kind Ruler and most tender lover, pious and humble Redeemer; gentle, merciful Savior, Lord! I humbly beseech Thee and implore Thee that Thou may enlighten me, free me and preserve the sisters of the Temple and all Thy Christian people, troubled as they are. We come seeking Thy guidance in the absence of our Knight Captain. If it is true that we are to be called into your service once more, we beseech You, reveal to us a sign!” 

Silence filled the house of God for but a moment before Toulon’s air raid sirens began to blare. Dunkerque and Algérie sprang to their feet and turned to face their soldiers, all of whom stood with arms and rigging at the ready. The silver-haired battleship held her heavy rapier aloft. “Soldiers of God, the enemy is upon us! To arms!”

Algérie hoisted her mace above her head. “For Toulon!”

A dozen voices joined with her. “FOR TOULON!”

\-----

“Kaga, come in. The enemy got here before us. They have air superiority and landing craft and are moving to engage. Bombardment of the docks is ongoing but the Sirens’ laser weapons need a direct line, which they’ll soon have. This is going to get bloody.”

“Copy, Akagi. We will move on the city for closer support. Turn back so I can screen the first wave,” Kaga replied to her sister. She and her contingent of destroyers from Thorson’s fleet, Eldridge, Z23, Javelin, and Shiranui, were enjoying a peaceful cruise through the blue waters of the late morning Mediterranean. With no submarine contacts on sonar, the early November climate was so delightful that Shiranui’s manjuu were sunning themselves on deck in shifts. Conditions for Akagi and the rest of the Toulon splinter fleet were, however, far from ideal.

“Negative, Kaga. These are not Ironblood aircraft. I sense only one Ironblood ship down there, maybe a cruiser. The rest are Siren, and there appears to be a hybrid as well. Empress has been busy it seems, and has committed a Mirror Sea to this fight. We have less than thirty seconds before their air power is all over us. Do pick up the pace, would you?” she teased in closing.

“So are we dropping or what?!” Tennessee shouted over the radio as it became clear that an orderly aerial insertion onto the Toulon docks was no longer an option. Akagi snorted.

“I’ve done more than my part. You lot feel free to engage the enemy however you see fit. As for you, Black Templar, I hope your precious soldiers can swim,” the kitsune mocked, her disdain for most humans more than evident. There was no time, not even for prayer. In the distance Jean Bart could see the weapons underneath the Siren aircraft begin to glow a bright and sickly green, and she knew fear.

“All soldiers, eject immediately! If the winds favor you, perhaps we can land to the southwest and make our way to the docks on foot. If not, shed your gear and swim. I will find you when it is done. Go with God, now!” the Knight Captain commanded, watching as the skies were suddenly filled with beams of energy, flaming aircraft, and a couple hundred white parachutes slowly falling towards the sea below. Cleveland and Tennessee had made their jump as well, leaving only Akagi, Forbin, Massachusetts, and Jean aloft. With Kaga’s speedy Zeros on the horizon behind them the bulk of the Siren aircraft did not linger, but that didn’t change the fact that their commander’s intent to not allow a single Nakajima to shore was clear. 

“Knight Captain, the whole fleet is still at dock!” Forbin interrupted, hands against the fuselage as she strained to get a good look at Toulon through the cloudy glass and occasional burst of flak. Below them to the southeast a fleet of sleek, black Siren ships was fast approaching effectively point blank firing range. Even kilometers distant, the direct beam weapons of the battleship class vessels were occasionally landing hits against Vichya ships at dock, with Strasbourg and Dunkerque shouldering the weight of the blows as best they could. Jean cursed, her vision tinted red with fury. The city itself didn’t seem to have suffered major damage, but several sections of the docks were already aflame and her comrades were sitting ducks as they tried to exit their berths and make their way through the narrow strait to the sea.

“How? Why?! Malin should have gotten here long ago! They should have been ready! We need to-”

“Knight Captain!” Forbin screamed desperately, her own aircraft shuddering as she witnessed the plane carrying Massachusetts and Jean Bart burst into flames, struck dead on by a Siren attack. With shaking hands she grabbed the eject lever and yanked as hard as she could. In an instant her world was whipping wind, blue skies, and the smell of burning fuel. She caught sight of a small, blue shield plummeting to earth as her parachute deployed. With little else to do as she descended to the water, the squire prayed. “God on high, please watch over us all!”

\-----

It had all happened in less than a second. Jean Bart had been so focused on the poor battle position of the Black Fleet that she’d failed to see the pair of Siren fighters circle back to target the handful of remaining torpedo bombers from Akagi’s flight. Massachusetts, however, had been vigilant. With speed contrary to her class and the size of her chest, the native woman reached out and took her into a tight embrace, throwing up a shield and her rigging as their plane was vaporized around them. Then they were falling, the wind roaring in their ears so strongly that they could barely hear themselves think, much less speak. One look into the Union battleship’s ruby eyes was enough for Jean to convey her deepest thanks, before the matters of her soldiers and kansen returned to the fore. The two women spread their arms and legs, slowing their descent slightly as the Templar pointed to the cluster of parachutes to their left. Massachusetts placed a hand to her chest as if to say ‘leave it to me’, then pointed downward. Below them, the *Cleveland* was already spitting out a prodigious amount of AA fire, but the unwanted presence had already attracted the fire of Siren surface ships. The only line of defense for the pivotal AA light cruiser was the *Tennessee*, who was already shrugging off fire from half a dozen Siren cruisers and capital ships where she’d landed just east of Pointe du Puits. With her plugging the gap, the Black Fleet had an opportunity to leave their berths unaccosted, while enemy amphibious craft would have to land much farther away from Toulon itself. The Sirens had taken immediate notice. 

Jean wanted to reassure her ‘skydiving’ companion that she would do everything she could to assist the Union forces, but Massachusetts had already left her, steering herself closer to the falling Vichya foot soldiers on a sudden gust of wind that seemed to bend to her beck and call. The Templar watched with delight as the majority of her troops from Casablanca were blown inland, which left only her and the rapidly approaching sea below. Clutched in her right hand were the remains of the wisdom cubes that the mysterious Commander Thorson had used to restore her to health. He’d left them with her, claiming that they were a gift and not fit for other purpose. 

*Shikikan Thorson is too kind to the scary knight lady, nyaa. But so long as you are on our side, do not waste the gift he’s given you! This is a chance to reinvent, be reborn, leave that stinky and unfinished hull behind you. Do nyat waste it!*

Despite the roaring conflict all around her, Jean could not help but smile at the memory of the mint-haired Sakura repair ship. Having seen how the cat-like kansen deftly tended to the wounds of Union, Ironblood, and Sakura alike, she found it reasonable to take her advice. The sea was approaching, the sun beat down on her, the Templar cried out for a leader, and she finally had the power to answer. Jean pointed herself towards the battle, closed her eyes, and held the cubes to her chest. She thought she could hear voices, a chorus of angels singing a song of triumph. It was preferable to the alternative: a bout of insanity shortly before death. A shape formed in her mind, a powerful hull sheltering troops by the thousands. A place where smelters and forges operated night and day, where soldiers would train and eat and worship. The hull's main guns were all mounted forward, so as to never retreat, and banners hung from every tower and rigging line. The floating cathedral was a vision so glorious it brought a tear of joy to her eye, to join the many she’d already shed on account of the vicious apparent wind. Absorbed in those thoughts, the Mediterranean rose to claim her.

“I don’t care where they came from or why they are here! God won’t give us another chance! Get out to sea now!” Algérie shouted into the radio. Dunkerque’s berth had taken a direct hit from one of Deutschland’s heavy shells before they’d even returned from the chapel, rendering her temporarily immobile due to flames and debris. Malin and the rest of the destroyers were ready to sortie, but without a capital ship to screen them they would do nothing but become fodder for the advancing force. “Strasbourg, what in the Lord’s name are you doing?!”

“The Ironblood force has not yet responded to my hail for a parlay. I will continue to-”

“That damned fool!” Algérie fumed, slamming a fist into the nearest solid surface. She had no desire to listen to the spymaster rationalize defeat. “Foch, Gali, Marseillaise, there’s no time. Dunkerque can’t sortie like this and Strasbourg refuses to leave negotiations and enter into open hostilities against the Ironblood. We move to screen the destroyers and strike back any way we can!”

“Algie, you know I can shrug off small caliber fire better than most but I can’t pull that off against battleships,” Galissonnière reminded her as she nevertheless formed up to the side of Algérie and Marseillaise. 

“Steel yourselves, warriors of God. If He wills it, we will see tomorrow. Our Day of Glory has arrived,” Marseillaise insisted, drawing her sword and readying her ship’s shields. “If we can protect the destroyers long enough to get torpedoes in the water, we have a chance.”

“Time to see just how good I can be. It’s an honor to die alongside you all!” Foch called out cheerfully, forming the final element of what was an admittedly rickety shield that Malin, Vauquelin, and the other destroyers formed up behind. “Anyone get the names of those two Union ships? They fight like hell.”

“I haven’t had a chance to… ask…” Algérie trailed off, grabbing a pair of binoculars and looking out towards the open sea from her bridge. At the farthest mouth of the harbor, past the Tennessee, something strange was happening. “What in the Lord’s name? Does anyone else see that, far out in the harbor? It looks like the ocean is boiling!”

“I see it too. Mon Dieu!” Le Malin confirmed, only to squeak and hold her hand to her lips as something broke the surface of the ocean. She and the rest of her fleet watched, dumbstruck, as a deep blue banner emerged from the sea. It was taller and longer than a Vauquelin-class destroyer, and featured the deep red cross of the Knights Templar. It soon waved proudly high above the battlefield. “I don’t- How?!”

The Templar Knights were too dumbstruck to say much of anything at all as the titanic battle standard was joined by several others, all attached to a mighty battleship hull. They could not see her main guns, for they all faced forward and were pointed out to sea at the enemy. The profile was unmistakable, however, and was soon accompanied by a familiar voice on all channels. 

“Soldiers of Vichya, Knights of the Templar Order, rally to me and draw steel! On this day we go to war!”

Hundreds were rattled and temporarily deafened as Dunkerque fired a full salvo from her main batteries in reply, yearning to strike back at the black silhouettes on the horizon. “It’s damn good to hear your voice again, Knight Captain. Malin, I’ll bake you an entire cake when this is over. No, an entire bakery!”

“Fleuret, Mars, Épée, stay behind and help get Dunkerque out of dock,” Algérie commanded, her heart singing with the voices of a thousand valkyries as her engines surged forward. “The rest of you, protect that Union cruiser and form up on the *Jean Bart*!”

“Vive l’Orthodoxie! Pour les Templiers! À la guerre!”

\-----

“Well, that’s certainly unexpected,” Brünhilde commented idly as she observed the enemy battleship rise from the sea and a fleet of Sakura aircraft join the scrum from the west. “Your orders, Deutschland?”

“The mission remains the same. Kill them all.”

Unlike my local, it doesn't have pool or darts (I usually invite someone to play and make small talk) therefore I'll just be sat there sipping my drink in what I can only assume is silence. Staring at my phone would only make me look like a bore.

Realistically speaking, the alternative is sitting at home alone spending time on the internet, which I already spend way too much time doing.

That's not immediately possible, and while I do plan to talk it out, I just need to vent to strangers on the Internet for a bit

I (29M) started chatting with a girl (29F) a few weeks ago. We met on an app, instantly hit it off, constant back and forth, good conversation, first date scheduled a few days after which ended up being a 5 hour coffee and walking date. Went home that evening and we scheduled the second date for the following weekend. All round, seemed incredibly positive and I genuinely thought things were going better after this one week than any of my previous relationships

Problems started in week 2. She got ill, and conversation dropped off a cliff. This shouldn't be a problem, but emotionally it hit me way harder than it should. Appetite disappeared, not sleeping, ended up having to take a day off work. Logically I knew I'd gotten unhealthily attached, but emotionally I couldn't help myself. I have therapy booked in to work through this, and there are a lot of separate complex issues going on

Towards the end of the second week, she was feeling better and we chatted a bit more. But one day it went from a midnight chat of ""be patient with me, it'll take time but I do want to see where this goes"" to a 2 hour video call the following day where she said she wasn't ready to date right now, previous trauma, etc. This was quite reasssuring, it hurt but I accepted it and got over it. Even though we were both feeling it initially, we moved pretty quick and we both learned from that. I figured that was the end of it, probably wouldn't hear from her again

Until this week, one week after the video call. She messages, just wanted to see how things were. I didn't think much of it, figured we got on well enough that maybe for once the whole ""let's still be friends"" thing might work out. Even though I've still got a huge crush on her, and feelings I'll need to resolve. We chatted a bit and that was that

Following day, she wants to video chat. Something had happened and she wanted to confide in me. Didn't feel she could go to close friends or family because of how they'd react. We spoke for 2 hours, I provided support and reassurance, basically at this point I'm worried about her and want to be a good, supportive friend. A part of me feels genuine happiness that she felt I was the person to talk to, along with a whole load of concern that she had to talk to me about this in the first place

Day after (yesterday based on when I'm writing this), I check in just to make sure things are okay. She's doing better, and mentions about wanting to change her hair. I joke about getting before and after pics to compare, few hours later she sends the before pic and says we'll have to video chat for the after pic. Says she can't be bothered to try get the same angle. We video chat for 2 hours until midnight

At this point, I'm confused as all heck. And I'll reiterate again, I won't know unless I speak with her. But some of the things running through my head:

* She's not ready for a relationship, but is confiding in me about rather private things. And she's choosing to confide in me and ask for advice over long term friends and family
* She's not ready for a relationship, but would rather video chat for 2 hours than send a selfie
* I don't want to disrespect her by pushing any of the relationship stuff when she's told me she's not ready, and especially when she's got stuff going on. But I also can't deny my own feelings, having a huge crush and genuinely vibing with this girl more than people I've known for years. I'm trying to balance my own wellbeing with hers. And within my own wellbeing, I'm trying to balance keeping myself healthy with the emotional health of whatever this relationship is
* We both have issues to work through, neither of us are perfect. And I don't care, I'm seeing people on dating sites and comparing them to her, thinking about her, waiting for her to message. She expressed that if I go find someone in the meantime it's fine, and I am trying because I do want to date again. But there's a part of me that just wants her, flaws and all
* She's mentioned about not bothering with online dating again, that when she's ready she'll let a relationship develop naturally with someone she knows. Of course, there's part of me that thinks that could be me. And there's part of me that doesn't want to misunderstand how she's acting now and potentially lose that chance in the future by doing something dumb. But of course, no idea when that might be, she doesn't know when she'll be ready for a relationship and while I've got stuff to work through I feel I'm ready now
* This is all just very new to me. I got out of a 4 year relationship earlier this year, and granted we weren't that close, the breakup then caused me to lose my appetite in muhc the same way. That made sense coming out of a 4 year relationship, it did not make sense when someone I'd spoken with for a week stopped replying to me due to illness. Messaging in general should not be causing such intense feelings, positive or negative
* She is human too. All the effort I put in was reciprocated, and while on the surface she might've said dating isn't on the cards right now, her feelings could be just as muddled as mine. Constant chats and 5 hour dates don't just disappear from someone's memory, and her behaviour these past days isn't representative of someone that has no interest in me. Maybe she just needs some social contact now. Maybe she's this close and open with all her friends. But for how little we've known each other, a 2 hour video chat instead of a selfie just doesn't add up
* It is entirely possible she's using me as an emotional crutch. Objectively looking in, there's a lot of red flags on both sides. An unhealthy part of me wants to keep living the ""what if"" than face up to talking about this. What I definitely don't want to do is tell her she's sending mixed messages, have her withdraw more and lose whatever we have, even if it's just a good friendship. It'll be up to me to deal with the crush side of things. But I'm not sure I can let this go on long term either because I can see me regressing to a loss of appetite and lack of sleep

If there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that I like this girl and I want to get to know her more to see if we're truly compatible. Until we chat, it won't be clear where things stand. Wish me luck I guess, and here's to hoping I can break the streak of overthinking and overanalysing",1,1731085660.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

It was more of a spontaneous decision so I only had about a month or so of prep time. I'm very fond of architecture and exploring as I go so we often just walked around the area. We also spent quite a lot of time shopping :D 

**Pre-planning tips and recommendations**

* Get Ubigi e-sim: super easy and painless to set up and there is always a 20% off coupon somewhere, it will save you money and time and the hassle of buying a SIM when you arrive. Ubigi worked as soon as I touched down. 
* Yamato Transport: the little black cat saved us the hassle of lugging around multiple suitcases worth of souvenirs and gifts through sometimes very long subway stations and rush hours. 100% recommend. Most staff can speak English if not a little google translate goes a long way. Keep in mind most hotels can only ship luggage for it to arrive the following day to be sure to plan accordingly. It also took us an embarrassingly long time to realize that most convenience stores offer the same luggage shipping services as the hotel and sometimes at a cheaper rate so be sure to check them out. 
* Sugi Drug mart: sells necessary and emergency over the counter medicine and is almost everywhere, we needed it due to a deer allergy at Nara 
* Google maps is your best friend but does not do well in navigating buildings with lots of floors.
* Book specific experiences in advance to structure certain days but I wouldn’t stress too much about packing everyday with specific times as it get slightly overwhelming 

(we booked→)

* Tea Ceremony and Kimono Experience at Kyoto Maikoya
* Bus tickets to Shirakawago from Kanazawa) 
* Kaiseki dinner with a ryokan we stayed at Kaga

* Get comfortable shoes: cannot recommend enough if you are not used to walking long distances in the city, the miles really take a toll on you and the last thing you want is to be tired before your trip has even begun.

**Itinerary** 

**Chiba**

Day 1

Flew in via JFK and landed around 5 am at Tokyo Haneda and drove to Chiba to stay with my cousins. I decided I would just tough it out with the jet lag after chilling for like 2 hours, and went straight to **Kamogawa Sea World** for the afternoon. It was more of a local aquarium/sea world so all the introductions and information on the animals were made in Japanese. I also mistook one of the sleeping walruses for a statue -.- I ate the first of many many soft creams on my trip and for dinner we ate at a family restaurant with a set menu, it was so good for the price! 



**Mt Fuji Region**

Day 2

We headed out early for a road trip to Mt Fuji, visiting **Makaino Farm** with a huge grassy slope where you can feed sheep and goats pellets and carrots and saw some glimpses of the elusive mountain while eating more soft cream. Stayed in a ryokan with a kaiseki dinner and rotenburo. The dinner included some really good sashimi but I am not a fan of crispy garlic and we were greeted with a cloudy view of Fuji-san in the morning and all you can eat buffet style breakfast. 



Day 3

We checked out **Oshino Hakkai,** which had crystal clear ponds and gave us the best view of Mt. Fuji up on the viewing platform that cost around $3. **Fujiyoshida** is awesome for Fuji Q Highland but we just stopped by for its famous street with Mt. Fuji in the background. It was quite the drive back to Chiba.



**Chiba**

Day 4 

Didn’t do much, just hung out with family.



Day 5

Ventured out on my own for the first time and explored the **Peria mall** around Chiba station (much prefer the Aeon Malls after completing my trip). Then I traveled to Narita to pick up my aunt.



**Asakusa**

Day 6   

Arrived around lunch time, checked into the hotel and then walked right into Uniqlo and did some damage. We visited **Senso-ji Temple** which was crowded for an off-season but still very impressive in its size and structure as it was the first temple on our journey. Then explored the shopping streets in and around Asakusa and got a matcha float. Headed to **Shibuya Parco** at night, said hi to Hachiko, stopped by the Starbucks at **Shibuya Crossing** and visited the **Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo** in Meguro.



Day 7

Started the morning off at **Tokyo National Museum** in **Ueno Park**, the park was pretty quiet in the morning hours and the further into the Museum the less people there were, with a variety of ancient scrolls, paintings, ceramics and buddha statues. During lunch there were several yatai set up for a food festival and we had to get takoyaki and grilled fish. We then went to **Ikebukuro** for its Animate store and I found I enjoyed it more than Akihabara. Visiting **Meiji Jingu** in **Yoyogi Park** was amazing at dusk but the atmosphere walking into the park leading up the shrine was slightly haunting due to a large group of crows that kept on calling which kind of added to the chill of the dense forest. We then stopped by **Akihabara** at night for a quick walk around and Book Off. 



**Hakone** 

Day 8 

It took absolutely forever to get to our ryokan in Hakone due to the slow bus and traffic in the mountain roads but we managed to visit the **Hakone Open-Air Museum** and it was honestly quite impressive, as someone who is generally not a fan of modern art, it had great architectural landscaping that allowed each art piece to breathe and did not feel overcrowded at all. The cafe in the center of the park hit the spot even if there were only two food options: hotdog and a muffin. The whole park was really conceptual but very well curated and laid out. 



**Hakone → Kamakura → Yokohama** 

Day 9 

BE PATIENT, the bus in Hakone is absolutely brutal and if you can drive, DRIVE. We waited for about an hour after bus driver upon bus driver told us the bus was full and that we would have to wait for the next one. But we managed to finally catch the bus and not miss our ride on the **Togendai Pirate Ship**, which gave us a clear view of the iconic red **Heiwa no Torii** in the water and took us directly to the cable car leading up to **Owakudani.** There is also a regular ferry but the pirate ship was just more fun bc obviously. The view of Owakudani from the cable car looked as if there were pockets of steam rising from the mountainside and lowkey looked like forest fire smoke. 



Around mid-afternoon we caught the train to Kamakura to see the **Kotoku-in** which enshrines the Great Buddha statue, once again, dusk was the perfect time to capture photos and walk around without it being overly hot as fall still hadn’t quite come. I ate more soft serve and headed up to Yokohama for the night. I got a kebab for dinner and it was amazing. 



**Osaka**

Day 10 

Arrived in Osaka, ate some of the best butter chicken curry I’ve ever had in Nishishinsaibashi, then took a walking tour path from **Amerika-Mura** to **Shinsaibashi Shopping Street** which is great for casual streetwear and has lots of international brands. I already liked the vibe of Osaka more, you could immediately feel it was more laid back than Tokyo, the shop staff were more friendly and much more willing to consistently try to talk. We had to pay a visit to Mr Glico Man at **Dotonbori,** stopped by a small shrine in the heart of **Hozenji Yokocho**, and saw the fierce facade of the **Namba Yasaka Jinja**. It was slightly sad that it appeared like an oasis between the high rises because it was facing a hotel I think? that was towering over it but also made it feel like another block on the street. We had to check out the Namba City shopping mall and if I recall correctly, there were quite a few boutiques on the B2 level selling very cute clothing.



Day 11

Started a relatively slow day at **Himeji Castle**, exploring the castle grounds.I visited Koko-en gardens thinking there might be some fall foliage and I was greeted with absolutely nothing but it was a nice walk. The interior of Himeji Castle is mostly preserved but the rooms did start to get a little repetitive after a while. I’d still say I think it’s good to visit the interior once because there were some insanely steep and slippery wooden steps to climb. We visited **Osaka Castle** in the evening, saw it lit up with lights and passed by a massive concert being played at Osaka Jo Hall and had some very nice tonkatsu in the park adjacent to the castle.  



**Osaka → Nara → Kyoto** 

Day 12

Feeding the deer at **Nara**, we saw some deer fighting, head butting a poor girl off the steps and biting tourists butt for food. Very cute but kind of aggressive. 7/10. Walking all around the Nara Park area, **Todai-ji** was very impressive, configured in a giant courtyard setting with really huge Buddha and guardian statues inside. We also stopped by the temple buildings of Todai-ji around the area. **Isuien Gardens and Museum** was serene and quiet but there was a very nice garden a little bit ahead of Isuien that was free and I felt like it was quite similar if not a little bit bigger but nevertheless, worth the walk around the park. Ate a very brunch style late lunch and headed directly to Kyoto afterwards.



Day 13

For our first full day in Kyoto, we booked an all day tour with lunch included with Sunrise Tours and both our tour guides for the morning and afternoon were really wonderful. We first saw **Nijo Castle**, a residence for the Tokugawa Shogun, then **Kinkaku-ji** which was expectedly packed, I chatted with our tour guide Yoshi-san who spoke very good english and was also really good at trivia from around the world, listing out language similarities in other countries that were similar to Japanese. The **Kyoto Imperial Palace** didn’t allow for much sightseeing into the buildings but the grounds were manicured to perfection as befitting of the emperor. Lunch was short but catered to vegetarians and a solid 8/10. We then switched buses and tour guides and saw the **Fushimi Inari Taisha**, didn't get a chance to hike all the way up though, it would’ve been better in the morning hours. What really impressed me was the **Sanjusangen-do Temple**, which houses 1,001 statues of Kannon deities, each with multiple heads and arms and the sheer amount of statues was just insanely impressive, but no photos allowed like many temple interiors. Our last stop was the **Kiyomizu-dera Temple** and **Sannenzaka** and another soft cream.



Day 14 

I prebooked a tea ceremony and kimono rental at **Kyoto Maikoya** and our tea ceremony master was a very sweet and friendly lady who gave us a short demonstration of a part of the tea ceremony and she really emphasized the phrase, “ichi go ichi e” “one chance, one encounter” and said that our tea ceremony today was also “ichi go ichi e” and in the quiet of the teahouse, I have to say it did move me a little. Since kimono rental was the whole day, we visited **Yasaka Shrine** in Gion before returning them. We had lunch near **Hokan-ji** and then revisited the **Sannenzaka and Ninenzaka** area to shop for souvenirs.



Day 15

I started the morning off at **Arashiyama Bamboo grove** and since it looked like it was about to rain, there weren't that many people on the trail. I walked to **Sagano Bamboo forest** as well before stopping by a secluded temple called **Jojakkoji** slightly off the main path and then the rain started pouring down. I took shelter in a courtyard house, but since I was really determined to still see the temple, when the rain subsided I was the only person in the quiet groves and stairs. I had originally wanted to visit Tenryu-ji but so glad I stopped by Jojakkoji. Since I still desperately needed an umbrella I stopped by a small pottery studio and shop nearby but slightly off the beaten track and met a very kindly old shop owner who not only sold me a tanuki statue but also deducted the tax and umbrella fee from the total. I swear his shop was something straight out of a ghibli film, especially with the heavy rain pouring down, foggy and damp. But when I walked out onto the main street leading up the station the magic was gone. I met up again with my aunt later in the afternoon to walk the **Philosopher's Walk** and we visited **Okazaki Shrine, Nanzen-ji** and a multitude of shrines and temples in the area before stopping at the famous Blue Bottle cafe for a bite before visiting the **Kyoto Handicraft center** for souvenirs and pottery. 



**Kaga**

Day 16

Slow morning, stopped by a bakery near the station to eat curry bread and took several trains into the countryside to reach **Kaga**. We had no major plans besides enjoying the kaiseki dinner and private bath the ryokan had to offer. It was a very quiet, sleepy resort town with affordable prices and frequented by many locals. I really recommend you to find a few spots on your trip without many major online recommendations that look beyond the major cities if you’re a big fan of a more serene escape in nature. They also cater to all sorts of diet restrictions as we ordered one vegetarian and one without sashimi. I would say it was like a holiday within a holiday.



**Kanazawa**

Day 17 

We may or may not have spent way too much time in the mall near Kaga Station buying clothes because everything was so affordable and very Japanese casual style, with academia vibes and muted tones. I think we spent about 2 hours in the same store. Most of the staff don’t speak English here but it wasn’t that much of an issue and we also managed to ship some items back to my cousin’s place. We then caught the Shinkansen through Fukui and arrived at Kanazawa. We visited the **Nagamachi Samurai District** and picked up more local Kutani pottery before having dinner at a local family run restaurant which served crab. 



**Kanazawa → Shirakawago → Kanazawa**

Day 18 

Spent most of the day at **Shirakawago**, which takes quite some time to get to but it was pretty unique and we had the best butter toast and red bean paste at a very very cute cafe that let you pick out the cup set you wanted to use for coffee and there was studio ghibli bgm. We sat around an open hearth with a pot of red bean soup boiling underneath and it was amazing. 



**Kanazawa → Tokyo** 

Day 19

Spent the morning exploring **Oyama Shrine** and the **Kanazawa Castle Ruins** area before visiting **Kenrokuen Gardens**, it started to get a little rainy by the time we left Kanazawa to head back to Tokyo. It was already evening by the time we checked in and we headed into Ginza to shop. 



**Tokyo → Chiba** 

Day 20 

We saw **Tokyo Tower** in the morning, and again at **Zozo-ji** before doing more shopping in Ginza and Tokyo station area. We visited Itoya, Tokyu Hands, Tokyo Station Character street and Daimaru at Tokyo Station. Before it got fully dark we headed back to Chiba. 



Day 21

More shopping at Mitsui Outlets, met up with my cousins and then had soba for lunch and visited Uniqlo nearby before a final ramen dinner. 



Day 22

Caught the first bus out to Haneda and flew home



**Final Thoughts:** I honestly loved the trip, I would definitely come back and explore North Japan or venture south to Fukuoka and Okinawa. I really liked the vibe of Osaka and the cities on the west coast but most importantly, it was just really nice to see family. 

I ended up visiting the Mt Fuji region twice with my cousins first and then my aunt because they had already prebooked the stay and I didn't know (it was a last minute trip after all) but since it was different regions I still had a nice time. 

A little bit of Japanese will be useful and just look around at what other people are doing, etc you stand on the left on escalators in Tokyo and on the right in Osaka. Trains are also generally quiet and you will realize pretty quickly if a foreigner is talking loud. 

Don’t overpack, there is literally everything you could ever need within walking distance so you can bring more clothes and souvenirs back. I want to thank everyone else's itineraries that helped me in planning so its only right I also leave my tidbit.

But thankful for this beautiful and wondrous yr! <3,"Left my job of 3 yrs since COVID 19 when I fell into after leaving TN for NC. And started a new job at a shitty company I use to be a Grocery Support MGR at which left me as a ON Stocking Associate. All I had was myself my cat, dysthymia, and many failed relationships with Cis/Trans Men, Cis/Trans Women, and fellow Intersex/NB people like myself. Built back up my credit to 743 Late December from the prior yr being 790 instantly dropping to 700. And got the tired of bicycling/walking/running to work to home. So I bit the bullet and bought my first car on loan. It was a 2017 Black Toyota Prius Four Touring at 5800 miles. And then met the loveliest kitten of my own-a Lesbian Trans Goddess. She even let me bring Mira with us on our very first date so I’d feel comfy and safe with her. Mira found some fellow cats I suspect children or some furries in town made. Another date we went dress shopping and she found the perfect jumper dress of them all. I shortly got “promoted” to verifier so I wouldn’t have to work 5-8 hour days anymore and switched me over to 4-10 hr days working Sun Night-Thurs Morning. Slowly I guess being with her I stopped feeling Non-binary as much as I use to do and just ended up defaulting to my birth expression as a Tomboy again. On my 33rd Bday she got me the most perfect mug for my future Pumpkin Spice Coffee Habits along with a new stuffie to lay my head down in the car during my lunch breaks. Shortly after that I ended up getting into a fender bender but stuck up some cute stickies on top of it all. We went to Florida during the summer to celebrate her 30th bday and to see my 29 yo brother who’s working on his PHD which he should obtain in December this yr. Sadly we found out his Latino gf turned him into a Far Right Conservative who jumps De Santis and Trump hard. It killed me inside knowing I could do nothing for him I get betrayed. Went all over and finished up in Augustine before leaving. They had a few cat friendly Air BnBs so we got to take Mira along for the trip. Before we left we stopped off at a Tex Mex Restaurant it made me so happy having comfort food growing up in a Spanish Greek and Romani childhood in Texas. I grew up hearing my family speak 5 different languages on a daily basis. And while I only heard English there it had some food I was use to it made me feel pretty happy. When we got home we made sure to do more waterfall swimming hikes. Our Transphobic and homophobic neighbor reported us to our transphobic and homophobic landlord that I had been letting my gf live with me. He started the eviction process but we weren’t evicted until Hurricane Helene hit us. We were looking at new places and finally settled on our real future home for the time being. During Pride this yr in the mtns we finally got her a car to replace her old klunker that died on the daily she looks so happy and gorgeous! And to settle in our new home together we picked out the perfect WiFi Name.

I want to get both licenses by my early 30's and the clear best path to do that in Florida based on how our licensing laws are setup is to work a civil job as an EIT for four years, pass the PE and FS during that time, and gain survey experience in years 5 through 9 as well as pass the PS.

What civil jobs do you recommend I apply to? I'm flexible to do anything in years 1-4.

I've been noticing a trend with the companies I've applied to prior to passing my FE. They have been midsized land development engineering firms with in-house survey crews. Every discussion more or less ends in them wanting to stick me in the survey department because the whole world is starving for qualified party chiefs, but there's no engineering job available. I've worked at these type of firms throughout college and they keep a strict survey/civil divide, so I'm not willing to trust a promise that I'll be brought in as a surveyor for $20 an hour and magically transition to engineering. I need to come on as an EIT. I think with my recently passed FE I may start getting different interactions so I ought to reach back out or start applying to different places.

I should also note that my resume is a whole page of survey work experience, worked as an I-man pretty much everytime I had 2 or more weeks off of school, but I have not worked as an engineer intern at all. I did this because I actually learned a shit ton of practical knowledge about something that interests me, while all of my friends were getting paid to essentially go on coffee runs. I can run my own traverses and do all of the necessary survey math, and I have basic openroads & c3d exp, but I haven't quite gotten any engineering offers maybe because of my biased resume. Like I said might change with the FE now.

Should I just say f the land development and go geotech or transportation? I'm flexible as to what type of civil I want to do for four years. But I very much need to focus on one, then the other, I have a clear goal of becoming a one stop shop by my early to mid 30s and don't want to be spinning my wheels throughout my 20s.",3,1731085116.0,civilengineering,3,1.0,False

Lately Ive been sedentary. Dont drink soda nor smoke, and rarely I eat something with sugar. Drinking beers on weekends and Im also not picky on my diet.

Any thoughts on it? Should I be ultra worried like I am? Its weekend here but Im already appoiting a visit to the doctor and lab next week. I also drink a shitload of coffee (without sugar), so I dont know if its anxiety playing with me or something serious",1,1731084992.0,prediabetes,0,0.67,False

I was very anxious before the test, did not sleep well, drink 1 coffee (should not), no banana (should have). Having completed the test with just 4 minors made me feel confident about my ability to pass it. The examiner and my instructor felt the same. It was a beautiful drive and I enjoyed it (except the roundabout on the NDR!). 

I feel even lucky for making this major mistake during my test rather than having an easier test route, pass it and make the same mistake in real life with my family in the car!

I notice women checking me out in places like the train sometimes but it feels awkward to just cold approach them out there especially since we don't even know each other. I've tried meetup groups but they're always mostly men and also women who are way older than me.

I tried going to bars at many occasions and every time, it's just men, and also women who are with their boyfriend. I'm not interested in going to nightclubs since they require staying up late, are difficult to get in and expensive, and very loud.

I tried Starbucks a few times but in my area, it's mostly high school students. I've been thinking of maybe going to a coffee shop located near a university, it's pretty far from where I'm at but it feels like the only way of meeting women in my age range.

I've had opportunities to date women years ago but at the time I wasn't as mature as I am now or as confident so I always let them go to waste.",1,1731084329.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Bravo, buddy. Nothing says ‘employee of the month’ quite like fabricating orders for customers who have zero clue.

**Warning, not some points will be taken from this post, as I believe it will explain this part better, I would like to touch on it \[**[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/v7m0pr/139_what_inspired_the_bad_ending_of_aot/)**\]**

Yes, another post on this topic, maybe you are already tired of listening, and the same arguments over and over again, but anyway, let's discuss this aspect of the ending, but with two sides. As we all know, Isayama was inspired by many works throughout the writing of the manga in this post, we will only touch on the manga called Himeanole. But unlike similar articles on this topic, for the first time in this topic we are addressing not only the manga, but also the film adaptation of this manga, filmed in 2016, and its features.

https://preview.redd.it/60noheskipzd1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a7c77fe3fcf85de7a09aa96a25284762670562b

**Part 1 What is ""Himeanole""?**

Himeanoles can be divided into two parts, which depend on which of the main characters is present in this chapter, as well as the secondary characters that are related to them. One of them is a relatively normal guy named Okida, he is kind of a loser, he doesn't have many friends and no girlfriends. This changes when he goes to a local coffee shop where he meets a woman named Yuki, who later becomes his girlfriend. There are various comedic and awkward moments in this part, most of which will be a special secondary character (Ando, ​​Okada's teacher friend), but what is important for us is the second main character, whose name is Morita.

Morita is not normal. He is almost a psychopath. In fact, he has already killed in the past and is inclined to do it again (he killed a bully who was bothering them together with one of his classmates). He also blackmails his former friend to send him money while not working for 7 years and spending the money on repairing vending machines. But still, his storyline begins, oddly enough, as a secondary character whose goal is to help his 'friend' kill her husband on the orders of his wife (insurance money) unfortunately the plan failed, and the 'friend' plans to escape because he is afraid of being arrested, but suddenly something unexpected happens and Morito simply kills him.

https://preview.redd.it/3d8k052khpzd1.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d53536ace0d7eae76c05899a082431e3500dc02

Later he calls his friend Wagusi, who he extorts money from, and asks him to help him with a case (he doesn't know about the murders) which leads to this dialogue.

https://preview.redd.it/kgsoav1mhpzd1.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=95be366da907355f5746262fdcaafa2c5cced3d3

And yes, it seems he doesn't feel any self-loathing or pity for other people, he also directly states his main goals (killing Yuki and tormenting her) several times throughout the manga and his number one goal never changes. Later the plot shifts from killing Yuki to killing Okade when Morito finds out that they are dating and that Okade can become a 'threat' and tries to get rid of him, he even hires a homeless person who has a license to help him if Wagusi can't (at the same time he lies that he wants to teach Okade a lesson as a bad person who offends his 'girlfriend' Yuki). However, this event becomes the last straw for Wagusi, he plans to turn himself in to stop Morito and his future murders, but his girlfriend suggests to just kill him, and he agrees to this, unfortunately, the plan fails, and they die at the hands of Morito. Now Morito uses the homeless man to get rid of the bodies (while threatening him that if he does not help, he will kill him) and also burns down his house to delay the police in investigating the missing people (as a result of the arson, people die). After this, several more bad things happen to him (killing a woman with cancer who took him in, killing a police officer who came to a call as a result of Morito getting a gun, killing Yuki's neighbor in an attempt to get her, as well as the man who was digging under him and who warned Okada, which caused Yuki and Okada to flee the city). As a result, in an attempt to achieve his goals, he killed 10 people and lost everything he had, but never got close to Yuki, for the first time he begins to think about himself and others and is caught by the police (knowing that he faces the death penalty).

**Part 2 Those Were Not Sunny Eyes.**  
Honestly, there's a lot to say about the adaptation, but we're focusing on the last 20 shorts of this movie, where things happen that weren't in the manga, and the first thing we'll touch on is the dialogue between Yuki and Okade in the hospital after Ando meets Morita (completely original scene)

https://preview.redd.it/6pt5yuiohpzd1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=d647eda8a4214aee0f7d995dda178aab11093319

**(01:20:33-01:22:00)**

Yuki: Mr. Ando will not die.

Okade: It's all because of what I did.

Yuki: What can I do?

Yuki: It is not your fault.

Okade: Of course it is.

Yuki: Morita...came for me.

Okade: It all started when we were dating.

Yuki: It is not your fault.

Yuki: Me too...did something.

Yuki: What did you do?

Okade: The truth is...when we got to high school...

Okade: I became friends with Morita.

Okade: We liked the same games.

Okade: But when Morita...

Okade: Kawashima mocked him...

Okade: I started keeping my distance.

**Okade: Then Morita...stopped coming to school.**

**Okade: And Kawashima...there was no one to intimidate and it became boring.**

**Okade: I forced Morita to go back to school.**

**Okade: I told him that Kawashima ready to apologize.**

**Okade: I lied to him.**

**Okade: I brought Morita to school. I teamed up with the hooligans.**

**Okade: I looked at him with contempt.**

**Okade: I'll never forget how**

**Okade: He looked at me.**

**Okade: With despair.**

**Okade: He was dying. These were not human eyes.**

And you all got it right, in the 2016 film we have a different Morito, unlike the original, where they often say that he was there from birth in the film, he's just a normal guy who was broken and who succumbed to a slight darkness and started killing. And also that all of this could have been easily avoided, that's why there are adult and child Morito in the film (this is also reflected in how the police catch him and that there was a final battle between Okade and Morita, which didn't happen, and they only talked once in the original) in the film they have 3 new dialogues, and they, unlike in the manga, feel more like friends).

[Completely original scenes \(rescue Yuki and capture Morito\)](https://preview.redd.it/be6nqbgqhpzd1.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3497150e3b5fad0fbc06c8f9202b3f65d0d9222)

**Part 3 Eren and Why It Just Doesn't Work**

So the theme we know Isayama's idea of ​​someone being ""born the way they are"" seems to mostly come from Himeanol, where Morita never managed to become a theme who could live in a normal society, and knew that there was always something wrong with him. (except in the movie, 2016) Isayama hinted at this in previous chapters. 121 is an example:

https://preview.redd.it/e741xm5uhpzd1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=662b0f68ecb1a1f3308f1994e04b92f0976be210

https://preview.redd.it/h48tyb8vhpzd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8e233d05d6040361e746e5fa5304b8d8338699f

He wished for it. He wanted it to happen.

In other words, 131 paints Eren as if he wanted to create the Rumble because he wanted to see the very world that was presented to him in Armina's book: In conclusion: Eren was born with a twisted desire for freedom, that freedom = flat earth (yes, as stupid as that may sound), and because of that, he committed the Rumble. He just wanted a clean surface and wanted to kill humanity because they were in his way.

The Himeanol check here is great. Morita, like Eren, wasn't born ""normal"" and he also had a sick and twisted desire. For his desires, it was to get pleasure by killing people. For Erena, it's a flat world that he wants to have and the only way to achieve that is to kill everyone.

https://preview.redd.it/rdy1onfwhpzd1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=164622281e63d12f847e6c5a7d80396433030299

**So why doesn't it just work!!!**

The difference between Himeanol and Attack on Titan is that the author of Himeanol portrayed Morita as a villain after his first kill. While you can feel sorry for him, it's hard to ever sympathize with him when you know he's doing it simply because he's an evil pervert who gets pleasure from these people.

Meanwhile, in Attack on Titan, Isayama wrote a ton of reasons why someone should root for Eren. Hell, we see Eren's mother get eaten (reveals he did it, thanks to 139 for that), which would make just about anyone angry. We see him become more calm and rational in Brawl, we see him get genuinely upset at what his father did. We also see Eren even give up his own life to save humanity in the Historia cave.

That doesn't fit a character who apparently just wants to flatten everything because of a random book. Hell, even Eren himself said that he FORGOT the dream he shared with Armin in Chapter 84:

https://preview.redd.it/nmskk9sxhpzd1.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ecbe734a282ea58fad743c9cb37004b5fcd37e8

131 wants to tell us that ever since he was a child, Eren has been inclined to see the Earth as flat and devoid of people, and yet in Chapter 84, Eren says that he has long forgotten about that dream and that it has been replaced by a desire for revenge.

Yes, you could say he regained this dream after Armina's resurrection, but consider that Isayama also stated this in an interview:

https://preview.redd.it/yehr29rzhpzd1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d4a677c0327f34485749b935181e52de4bd92b1

He wasn't interested in the sea, he was interested in seeing these things without being bound by any restrictions.

But then the number 131 comes up, implying that ""seeing this scenery"" was what Eren had wanted all along, ever since he was a child. There's a reason why these two panels use the image of Eren as a child:

https://preview.redd.it/hbtrcyg1ipzd1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=e81063885da43e4ec2dd98a648f1fc7873a29b8e

Suddenly, what he wants to achieve isn't the freedom he would get from killing his enemies, not recognizing the freedom of whatever he wants to think, but the view itself.

The implication is disturbing. In fact, even if the outside world was completely peaceful, Eren would still have caused the Rumble because he was disappointed that humanity even exists outside the walls.

He says it himself:

https://preview.redd.it/9gqp8yy2ipzd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=5869f813cf0e8412cd5ac8d4d80f25902a7e0d0b

So Eren wanted to do the Rumble because he wanted a flattened world, he stated this in 139, he stated in 131 that he was disappointed that everything still existed and that he wanted to wipe it with his face. ground. He also stated that it was primarily because the world was not like the one in Armina's book.

But how does this fit with the same guy who himself previously stated that he forgot about this dream? How could something that Armina's book told him be taken to make him want to destroy the world?

Isayama couldn't answer any of these questions. He took only one part of Morito's character and ignored all the others or replaced them with something that never seemed part of originality or even contradictory to him. Morito is honest with himself, he knows what he wants and what he will do (get rid of any threat that could motivate him to catch Yuki) for the sake of his dream, in the movies he almost achieved this goal, and we see what could have happened to Yuki. Morito cheated, killed the people who lived in the houses he killed, and they are not needed to justify his actions, because he knows why he did it and most of the time he killed without remorse, so he was from the beginning to the last chapter.

And what's funny is that when the desire for conscience appeared, woke up and asked about the killed, he again said only to himself that we should believe that Eren was born in a flat world, but we also saw him state that he forgot about his dream. In essence, we had Isayama himself state that Eren does not care what the outside world looks like, but that he cares about being free to see it.

According to the High School Caste, even AU!Eren needed to be disrupted:

https://preview.redd.it/5atqa0y4ipzd1.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed7ff12fb60884a294ff92531711912a05119f2a

And yes, the high school castes are concerned about the basic style, it's (sort of) canon, and the characters live in different countries.

flattery, but according to Isayama, they have the same personality.

So yeah, Eren's character becomes messy because Isayama got too inspired by a work that was created too late and implemented it in a bad and rushed manner, which hardly makes any sense.

**TL;DR**

**The ending was messy and confusing, Isayama shouldn't have tried to force the ""born this way"" theme that he read about in Himeanole and also add new features that were not typical of the original and contradicted.**

**P.S.**

**Although it is also worth noting that besides Isayama, there are two more fans of this work when reading the thoughts of the first fan, you ask questions when reading the thoughts of the other, you ask yourself terrible questions, to which I definitely don't want to know the answers, but maybe I'll write about it someday**",1,1731084235.0,u_Good_BADs,1,0.99,False
1gmmwxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1gmmwxj/talking_to_strangers/,Talking to Strangers,"I guess by now that you know that I'm an introvert. And I'm pretty sure you're empathetic enough and have enough social awareness to know that that just means I need to recharge sometimes, not that I don't like being around people. True, I can be shy when the stakes are high. And I guess the fact that I don't really open up to people until I'm comfortable with them makes me a bit reserved.

But I *love* people, and I *love* to chat. Sure, I rarely initiate, but if the service manager at the auto shop asks me about the clay mug I'm drinking my coffee from, well, then I'm gonna start chatting with him.

And, honestly, getting drawn into conversations with people I wouldn't ever talk to on my own is on the very long list of things I look forward to in our future relationship. On my own, I would probably *never* go and introduce myself to the band after a show, but in truth I would *love* to, so the fact that you *would* and *do*…

Gosh, that is *incredibly* attractive to me.

Also, side note: you have, since the day we met, had a remarkable (and thus far in my life, unique) ability to recharge me on-the-go. I haven't *ever* run out of social energy when you've been around. I used this analogy for a very different kind of thing a few months ago (…ahem…), but you're like a portable charger for me, always somehow keeping my energy topped off, with no special effort on your part. It's… amazing, like the rest of you. But I digress…

All of this is to say, there was one of those videos I usually scroll past on FB the other day… I mean, I don't need to know the ten signs a woman is attracted to you or whatever… the way your eyes burn into mine sometimes tells the whole entire story. But, this one was different: 7 signs an introvert likes you. Well. I already know the things *you* do that let me know that you like me, but what about you? What signals am *I* giving off? Anyways, it sparked my curiosity, but I really didn't want to feed the algorithm, so I searched for it in an incognito tab and found the same video on youtube. So… what are those signs? And am I doing them? Hmmm… let's find out…

1. They make an effort to spend one on one time with you. Well. This one is difficult. I would *absolutely* do this, but it's hard, as I know you know. But the rare times we have had to ourselves, I will forever treasure and cherish. The video does call out taking walks together, or inviting you to coffee, both of which are things I've even written about here… so, yeah, I haven't really done this but I *want to* so, so badly… anyways, onwards…
1. They open up about personal things. Yeah, I don't know if you've caught on to this yet, but I am an open book to you. I don't always volunteer things of my own accord (though, sometimes I do…), but I would answer any question you ever ask. Seriously, anything. I imagine you could even break down all of the walls between us in seconds with just the right question, if you wanted to… There is truly no one else in this world that I feel safer opening up to than you.
1. They initiate contact, even if it's subtle. Hey! I got this one! Not every day, but more and more often as time goes on. I imagine I'm not the only person you send random stuff to on Facebook (though, I also imagine the ones for me are more meaningful than anything you send others… probably?), but *you* are the only person *I* send stuff to. Lucky you, eh?
1. They remember the little things you say. Pretty sure I've got this one, too, though I guess I'd have to ask you whether I demonstrate it enough or not. I mean, look… my memory is… wishy-washy sometimes, but there seems to be a compartment set aside somewhere in my brain for my interactions with you, even the ones from long before I fell completely in love with you (we never did get together to play Scene It?, btw… though more recently, we have had some excellent game nights!). Anyways, if you said it, there's a pretty good chance Mr. Cool Cap remembers it. But, gosh, just wish I could remember whether it was Hot Tamales you said you like, or Red Hots………
1. They let you see their quiet side. Well, like the one-on-one time, this one is sort of situational and difficult for us to achieve at the moment. But, just as I'm looking forward to chatting with you *endlessly*, I also just cannot wait for just… like… companionship time. Sitting quietly by the campfire together. Snuggled on the couch reading books. Watching the waves roll in. *Any* time spent with you is magical, to me.
1. They subtly include you in their inner circle. Um. Well. Truth is, I don't have an inner circle, at least not locally. Or, I didn't anyways, not until the past couple of years… but it was more that I've started getting drawn into yours than the other way around. But, look… if somehow we had all met each other in my hometown, and I still hung out with all my old high school buddies, then I absolutely, 100% would have brought you around to spend time with them. And they would adore you, I'm sure of it.
1. They're patient and supportive of your needs. Patient, yes. Lol. I'm pretty sure I have infinite patience when it comes to you. And I guess this is another one we'd have to ask you about, but I absolutely do try to be supportive. All I want to do is support you, in whatever way you need at any given time. I want to be reliable for you, be your rock. I just want to always be there for you… and I *am*, even if our situation makes it awkward, or difficult sometimes.

My gosh, this went on *far* longer than I intended, lol. And, after doing a deep dive into it, I'm pretty sure these are all just signs that *anyone* likes you, introvert or otherwise. After all, *you* do *all* of these things for me, and while I could be wrong, I'm pretty sure you're an extrovert\*. But, maybe it's a matter of relative significance… or maybe it's all pop-psych garbage in a poorly-produced, probably-AI-generated video. 🤷‍♂️

Still, *I* thought it was an interesting thought exercise. Then again, one of my favorite recent FB group finds is the Dull Men's Club… but, hey, you've sent me posts from that group before, so………

Anyhow. Babe, I love you. Sorry, this was a long read. What can I say? Work is slow this morning.

Hope you have a day that's as beautiful as you are!

Yours.

\* I don't think I ever posted it here, but I wrote something — an essay, really, lol — about how I think you're likely an ENFJ. I still think so, even after getting so much closer to you over the past year, though I do allow that I may be wrong. And I promise I don't *only* think so because ENFJ and INFP are supposed to be remarkably compatible. Not to mention make for incredible lovers… ahem.

I have no issues with sitting in my local pub as I'm a regular and know the staff really well, but the thought of sitting alone in a bar is quite nerve-wracking. Funny enough, I used to visit this same place for coffee a while back, but coffee during the day seems different to alcohol on Friday/Saturday night.

Unlike my local, it doesn't have pool or darts (I usually invite someone to play and make small talk) therefore I'll just be sat there sipping my drink in what I can only assume is silence. Staring at my phone would only make me look like a bore.

Realistically speaking, the alternative is sitting at home alone spending time on the internet, which I already spend way too much time doing.

I'd like your opinion on any experiences you've had with an espresso coffee machine. I am considering purchasing the Victoria Arduino Venus Bar. Link at bottom.

I saw it at a hotel in Italy, and thought about it a year or two ago and keep thinking it'd be grand for my home. It's certainly overkill on every measure, but we do a fair bit of entertaining, so I could almost justify (not really).

If you have any experience with the machine, can you tell me:

1. How hard is it really to learn to use? I'd say I'm a A- at making espresso with manual espresso like Flair.
2. How is the quality of the espresso when made properly?
3. How reliable is the machine? How hard is it to get serviced in the Midwest?
4. Is there a downside to getting 3 group heads beside the cost?
5. What is your overall opinion of the unit?
6. Can you tell me anything else I should know as I decide to purchase it?
7. Do you know of any good sources that have a lower markup? I imagine not too many companies import it. Would it make sense to buy in Italy and import myself?
8. Would you consider buying used?

Thank you so much for any input!

I still remember when I thought I'd be that Instagram-perfect mom who'd lovingly rock her baby for hours. Yeah, about that... 

I decided to give this Graco sway swing a try, here's what happened.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

The box was surprisingly compact, which immediately triggered my ""this can't possibly work"" anxiety. (It's the same feeling I get when ordering jeans online, too).

Assembly was refreshingly straightforward. The instructions actually made sense, Within 20 minutes, I had transformed this pile of parts into what looked like a miniature carnival ride for sleep-deprived infants.

No leftover parts, no mysterious screws, and most importantly, no need to call my engineer friend who usually gets roped into these situations. So far, so good.

# My Favorite Features

**The side-to-side sway:** Unlike traditional swings that go front-to-back like a tiny playground swing, this one moves side-to-side like you're slow dancing at prom. It's gentler and more natural, mimicking how you probably already rock your baby (unless you're that one parent who does the helicopter spin). The motion is hypnotic enough that I've caught myself swaying along with it while standing in the kitchen, which is only mildly embarrassing when delivery people catch me.

**6 speed settings:** It's like having six different levels of desperation to choose from, depending on how many hours of sleep you got last night. Speed 1 is perfect for those ""I just need five minutes to drink this coffee while it's actually hot"" moments, while Speed 6 is for those ""I haven't showered in three days and need to wash my hair NOW"" emergencies.

**Plug-in option:** Finally, something that doesn't require a constant supply of D batteries that cost more than my monthly coffee budget. Yes, you can use batteries if you want to be mobile, but the plug-in option is ideal for me. 

**15 songs and sounds:** The playlist ranges from classical tunes to nature sounds. Don't worry, it's not that bad. Though after the 100th loop, you might find yourself humming Mozart in the shower. The nature sounds include rain and waves, which are surprisingly effective at drowning out my neighbor's seemingly endless home renovation projects.

**Two-speed vibration:** Sometimes swaying isn't enough, and you need to break out the big guns. The vibration feature requires batteries, but this feature seems reasonably efficient. I haven't had to replace anything yet.

# Real World Performance

The first time I put my baby in it, I held my breath like I was diffusing a bomb. I was worried I'd just wasted my money on yet another ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" purchase. But no - the gentle swaying motion worked its magic, and within minutes, my tiny dictator was actually... peaceful. What more could I want? I was thrilled.

Also, the compact design means it fits practically anywhere, which is crucial when your home already looks like a baby gear showroom exploded in it. I can keep it next to my workspace, which means I can actually answer emails with both hands while maintaining visual contact with my little one. 

# Pros

* Takes up minimal space (unlike that giant jungle-themed swing my mother-in-law insisted I ""had to have"")
* Actually pretty affordable (I can still afford diapers this month)
* The harness is secure enough to calm my new-parent paranoia
* Simple, intuitive controls that I can operate while half-asleep
* That blessed plug-in option (seriously, worth mentioning)
* Sturdy enough to handle daily use but light enough to move around
* Easy to clean
* Multiple speed options that actually make a difference
* Music that won't make you want to move to a remote cabin in the woods

# Cons

* The mobile doesn't spin
* Some babies might outgrow it fast
* The clicking sound might drive you slightly nuts
* Vibration feature requires batteries (but at least it's just for vibration)
* Assembly requires more floor space than your average yoga mat

# Final Thoughts

It's a great buy for anyone who:

* Wants their arms back occasionally
* Live in a space smaller than a palace
* Appreciates not having to take out a second mortgage for baby gear
* Needs something that actually works instead of just looking Instagram-worthy
* Is tired of changing batteries more often than diapers
* Wants a swing that doesn't require its own zip code to store

If you're expecting a swing that does everything short of changing diapers this isn't it. But if you want a reliable way to soothe your baby while maintaining your sanity, it's pretty neat. It's like having an extra pair of arms, minus the weird looks from strangers.

They pay staff differently for example someone the same gender as me gets £1 more per hour although she has 1 year less experience, but we have the exact same role. 

Anyway the reason you came to this post. My work put in the gc today

“We want to emphasize that discussing individual pay rates is strictly prohibited. This includes asking about or disclosing your own or another employee's pay rate. Your par rate is a personal matter between you and *company*”

But under the equality act 2010 it’s illegal for employers to prevent employees from discussing pay with one and other. 

What do I do? They haven’t even given me my contract yet they keep prolonging it, but I love the people I work with and kinda need the job so I can pay the bills.

Can anyone help/advise?

I'm a 33/f who has struggled with it my whole life and it was so bad that it turned into staph when I was younger. 

I moved from a dry, hot climate to a wet, cold one and the seasonal changes have always given me flare ups. I've tried every cream, pill, shot on the market including elimination diets. Nothing worked. 

Finally, I came across a recipe for ""fire honey"" from a naturopath I follow on IG. She mentioned it can help with eczema for some people so I decided to try it. I've been mixing it into my coffee every morning for 2 weeks and I'm FINALLY eczema free for the first time in my entire life. It's been miraculous for my recovery and self esteem. Also, it has worked wonders for my GI tract. It is incredibly potent and anti-inflammatory. 

Here's the recipe for anyone who is interested:

1 cup honey
1 tsp ground ginger 
1 tsp turmeric 
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp cinnamon 

Mix together and store in a well sealed glass jar. Do not refrigerate. I take it every morning with coffee (1 heaping teaspoon a day) but tea or warm water would work too. 

Hope this helps someone out there. ❤️

⚡SEAN FACTS⚡️

My name is Sean.

I’m 40 years old 🎉

I’m Scottish! I was born in Scotland, moved around the world a little bit through education and work etc and I’ve come back to live in my little hometown.

I’m currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can’t complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

It’s not unusual to find me deep inside a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I’ll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone’s head 😊

In what very little spare time that I have, I like to go to the gym. I seen someone post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that with someone too. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I’m never ever going to get through.

Why am I posting on Reddit? I'm here for some fun casual conversation. I miss the social aspect of being at shows and meeting new people so making friends and having conversations on here scratches that itch.

There’s been progress since [my last update](), but most of it’s less visible than last time. Thanks all for the continued support and encouragement though, we’re getting somewhere!! (I’m doing more deep cleaning maybe than the standard unfuck, but I have the time and, it appears, briefly, the will, so why not)

Some highlights since weds morning, no particular order:
* for months, my “projects” whiteboard has included “tidy under couch”. That’s cleaned off the whiteboard now (well, it would be, it’s just been on so long i need the windex and haven’t got there yet 😂). But I pulled everything out from under and behind and dealt with (most of) it
* weds night I cooked in my super-clean kitchen and did the dishes relatively promptly! It ***remains*** super-clean, which is usually the hard part
* washed two pillows, all the pillowcases, and all the reusable bags
* as planned I sorted all the loose paper last night (the cats helped) and got the recycling out this morning before pickup. Still have a folder of Things To Be Filed, but a folder is smaller than a milk crate.
* ever since I moved in there have been several small, well-defined, very brown and very intractable stains on my very beige living room carpet. I tried several times early on to get rid of them but eventually just gave up and resined myself to keeping the coffee table over them & them out of view. Well—Wednesday I was holding my spray bottle of industrial degreaser and saw that (in addition to having a “pleasant orange scent”) it supposedly works on carpet. I figured “what do I have to lose?”, sprayed the spots, and they … basically melted. Photos from midway not pre bc I didn’t expect it to work at all. So that was nice
* in a similar vein, I have a single-sock bag and for years it’s held a widowed sock I didn’t want to get rid of, bc it’s cute/has cats on. I’ve been leaning towards letting go of it lately, but I’m glad I didn’t, bc last night I opened a tin where I keep “small amounts of foreign currency as souvenirs” and lo and behold! Cat sock! It must have been used as padding… when I moved in? Anyway. Lesson of this and the carpet spots is, I guess, “idk, try?”
* put away summer shoes
* did a bunch of other laundry—which means that my Sort/Fold/Hang pile has grown immensely 😅 but that’s a tonight project
* got a little rug that hopefully will reduce the cats attacking the underlying carpet! May need many rugs, and more feliway/anti scratch spray. We’ll see

Anyway, thanks again for cheering me on, it’s really immensely made a difference",45,1731083576.0,ufyh,8,0.99,False

\---------------------------------------------

I massaged my wrists as we walked out of the house.



I followed Lotrick, Fern’s little brother, down the cobblestone path. The morning sun was peaking through the slits between buildings and the two moons had long passed over the edge of the high canyon walls.



The burns from the light threads Zola had used on me last night were still visible. Each wrist ached when I massaged them.



—*Come to think of it, you’re covered in scars,* I thought to Fern as I analyzed the crisscrossing scars along my new hands and arms. I remembered my face, Fern’s face, had several gashes along it as well when I looked into the water barrel.



—*‘Yes, Mother has always assured me that any act of defiance will cause punishment,’* Fern said flatly.



—*That’s…rough. I’m sorry about that. Why is she like that?* I asked.



—*‘Well, I wouldn’t have gotten hurt last night if it wasn’t for you. That was the first time in weeks she had hit me.’* Annoyance rose in his echoing voice.



—*Right…sorry.* I pushed my fingers through my new green hair. My messy green hair fell below my ears, and it felt like Fern hadn’t washed it in weeks.



 



The homes of Corello had silken rooftops of vibrant colors that flickered like a rainbow. I hadn’t noticed the color covering each home when I looked out over Corello last night. Each cubic-like home proudly held up a colored tarp with poles that served as shading for the rooftop access. The buildings, built with what looked like sandstone, had a golden-like color to them. Long lines of color were painted along each edge of the building, causing them to stand out based on the color of the paint. Fern’s house, I guess mine now too, stood proudly sporting green colors along the edges of the home and a giant purple tarp that covered the rooftop.



—*What do the colors mean?* I nodded towards the rooftops.



—*‘You’re asking a lot of questions when you should pay attention to my brother. If you mess up again, Mother is going to hurt us much more than last night.’* I felt my temple twitch, almost like Fern’s annoyance was pushing through to my body.



He was right though. I am in this strange new place; it’s important to stay focused and be on guard. Noah could be in an even worse situation. Where is he? Why did he leave like that? Before I could worry about him, I needed to avoid getting killed. If Fern’s mother easily hit her son with no remorse for waking up in the middle of the night, I can’t imagine what she would do if she knew a strange man had taken control of his body. She already called him cursed once.



I shifted my attention back to Lotrick and surveyed him. His hair was a blend of purple and gold, an unusual combination, but I shouldn’t think so since my hair is green. He also radiated magic.



—*He’s a…what did you call it, a Mageblood, right?* I averted my eyes from the young boy and asked Fern.



—*‘Is it that obvious even for an outsider?’* Fern said with a sigh. *‘The little brat always shows off his glow.’*



—*His glow? I guess I see it. He has an aura about him, like the main character from a battle anime.*



—*‘Main character? Anime?’* Fern asked.



—*Ignore me.* I shook my head and looked back at Lotrick.



The young boy, maybe 10 or 12, had golden eyes, much like my own - or rather, Fern’s. He shifted his gaze towards me, causing me to jerk my stare away. It was jarring to see such intensity in someone so young.



“Keep your head forward, brother,” Lotrick said, his voice calm but firm. “And you should open your shirt more at the top.”



“Huh? Why should I do that?” I asked the boy.



Lotrick stopped and looked at me as if I had called him a name. “Are you questioning me? My, my, mother must have hit you hard last night. Open it. Now,” He slapped my chest with the back of his hand before continuing to walk.



I complied, fumbling slightly with the tan garment. As I pulled the collar open, I noticed a strange tattoo in the center of my sternum. A simple design, circular with unconnected lines, like a worn-away shooting target that seemed to spiral into the center of my body.



—‘*That marks us as a Voidblood,’* Fern’s said. ‘*It’s how they identify us. How they humiliate us.’*



I held back a frown, not wanting to give away my reaction to Fern’s words. A system of marking people based on their magical ability - or lack thereof - seemed disturbingly close to practices I’d learned about in history class back on Earth. The mistreatment of humans seemed to cross universal boundaries.



Lotrick nodded approvingly at the exposed tattoo. “There, that’s better. We wouldn’t want anyone to forget what you are, would we?”



—*He’s arrogant for a child. I thought,* but Fern did not answer.



I forced a smile and threw my hands up. “Of course not, brother. You were right, mother knocked my senses out of me!” I laughed and clapped Lotrick’s back. “So, where are we going again?”



“For the love of Zander, what is with you today?” Lotrick rolled his eyes, ignoring my question. He behaved oddly maturely for a young boy. How old is he?



We turned from the small quiet street and stepped into a large town square. The morning life of the town burst with energy. In the center of the square, a large fountain with several stone sculptures of men and women wearing ridiculously enormous hats spouted bright, almost glowing blue water from their outstretched pale stone hands. Along the sides of the square, different shops had opened up. Some seemed familiar to me.



A restaurant owner set up a sign painted with a picture of a pastry, a cafe was already open with patrons sitting on small little tables outside drinking what looked like coffee, and other merchants displayed their own painted signs advertising their business. A group of children no smaller than Lotrick pushed past us, tossing a ball. I pinched myself to keep from gawking at the different children. Some had ears and tails.



—*Whoa! Ok, I know you are tired of the questions, but you gotta explain that! Those? Them? The animal children.* I pestered Fern in my mind.



I felt like I could hear him sigh.



—*‘Those specifically? That girl is a Canis-Woman, and the taller boy is a Reptilia-Man. Beastmen from other countries around Morne. They have all the same rights as other mortal races. If they are Magebloods, that is.’*



The little beastmen and human children ran around the fountain tossing the ball. When I looked closer, I saw that the ball they were tossing wasn't a ball at all but, a formed, floating, ball of water, suspended in shape.



—*Ah, I see. Magic does run this world. I thought quietly to Fern.*



The children were all keeping the ball in its shape. Their hands stretched out with light blue strings between the fingers, forming a sort of design between their hands. The ball of water would bounce off of one string design to another that a different child held. It was hard to get adjusted to this world, so instead of questioning everything, I started to just accept it. Fern seemed to not have a lot of time to himself, so for now, I will have to go with whatever was thrown at me. At least until I could sit and think about everything. I still needed to find Noah. I stared off in thought at the kids playing with the water ball before I bumped into Lotrick.



“Watch it,” He snorted. “We are here, Jade Supply.” He pointed in front of him at a tall building.



—*‘That’s right, brother needs his school supplies,’* Fern said with a hint of annoyance in his voice.



Lotrick has stopped and looked up at the building.



The store used the same sandstone material as the other buildings. The roof had a light green tarp draped over it and jade green painted lined the edges of the building. On each floor, a small balcony jutted out over the street. On the second floor, two beastwomen who I could only describe as cat-girls were sitting on the porch drinking tea. They looked down and their eyebrows raised when they saw Lotrick standing below them.



“Ah, Master Lotrick!” one girl yelled. They waved down at Fern’s brother.



One had short black hair and wore a plain white collared shirt with black pants. Her companion had white hair and wore the same uniform-like clothes. They both were human in every aspect except for their long tails, pointed ears that peaked through their hair, and short whiskers on each cheek. I assumed they worked at this store.



They stood up on the balcony railing and flicked their palms upward with their fingers pinched together. A sharp gust of wind blew up between Lotrick and me. A visible gust of wind twisted at both of their feet and slowly lowered them down in front of us. They were taller than us by a good foot, at least six feet tall.



“Master Wor is waiting for you. Also, Miss Rosie is in there too!” The black-haired one nudged Lotrick and gave him a wink.



—*So, magic seems pretty common, huh?* I asked in my mind, admiring the floating ability these girls had just used.



—*‘It’s exactly what I told you. I got unlucky. The 1% of the population that can’t access the source,’* Fern said.



I gritted my teeth at his response.



—*Of course, when I get a chance to be in a fantasy world, I can’t even use magic. Just my luck. I hope Noah is doing better,* I thought. Fern did not respond. He seemed to ignore most of my complaints.



“Great, thank you, ladies,” Lotrick said as he strode past the two. They outstretched their arms for him to enter the double doors.



The sign above the doors was painted in big gold symbols spelling out Jade Supply. How did I read that? I shouldn’t be able to read that, but I did. Is it because of my connection to Fern? I pushed the thought away. Just one more peculiarity that I ignored for now. I quickly followed behind Lotrick. The two cat girls glared at me. Their slit iris seemed to peer into me. I hurried past them into a dark hallway before we got to another set of interior doors.



 



The shop was big, bigger than it had looked from the outside. Inside, a high ceiling rose fifty feet in the air, coming together in a dome-shaped mosaic that I couldn't make out. I glanced around, taking in the shop’s interior. Shelves filled with an array of objects lined the walls. Books, tools, potions, herbs, weapons, and more. It was like a fantasy player’s ideal general store in a video game. The air smelled of incense and something metallic. Where there should have been more floors, based on the balconies outside, were interior ramparts. Cat-girls and cat-boys shuffled back and forth above the open ground floor. Some carried bags, some pushed carts, but all were in a hurry.



We stepped down a long ramp that led to the center of the circular room. My eyes darted around frantically, soaking up everything. Seeing a real-life fantasy store made me almost twitch with excitement. I wished Noah were here so I could enjoy this with him. He would freak out.



People crowded Jade Supply’s cavernous space. There were dozens of humans and beastmen alike sprawled throughout the shelves, wandering the labyrinth of magical wonders. Hanging from the ceiling were ten huge glass jars. They were as big as me and each had dirt in them. Some of the dirt was a dark brown, almost black color, others were red or orange. Some jars held moss within their dirt and one had gravel-like rocks.



Past the center of the room, behind a large, half-circle counter, and hung up on the wall, rows of silver rapiers gleamed. Nearby, I spotted uniforms that looked like they belonged in a posh private school, but with added utility pockets and holsters for books.



We walked down the ramp, and I glanced at the shelves nearby. Books of all sizes and colors lined them, alongside jars of mysterious ingredients and other magical paraphernalia.



As my eyes scanned the labels, all the symbols made sense to me. Just like the sign outside, I could read. The characters, foreign as they were, made perfect sense to me.



—*‘Of course you can read, you’re in my body,’* Fern’s voice echoed in my head. *‘I learned before they found out I couldn’t use magic.’*



—*That is incredible,* I thought, realizing I could access some of Fern’s knowledge. *However, I don’t know what any of this means, reading is useless for this sort of thing.*



—*‘Strange,’* Fern whispered.



I was about to pull a book that caught my eye when a cheerful voice called out, interrupting my exploration.



“Lotrick! Fern! You’re here!” The voice yelled from behind us.



I turned to see a girl who looked about Lotrick’s age. Her face lit up with a bright smile.



The girl with jet-black hair and startlingly bright pink eyes hopped over the railing of the ramp to join us.



“Lotrick!” she wrapped him in a tight hug. He stiffened, pushing her away with an annoyed grunt.



“Rosie, please,” Lotrick sighed. “I hope you won’t be so... expressive at school.”



She laughed, playfully punching his arm. “Oh, don’t be such a bully.”



Then she turned to me, her smile widening. “Fern! Look what I taught myself!”



Rosie held out her hands, and suddenly a swirling orb of fire and ice materialized between them, spinning. The conflicting energies created a mesmerizing dance of red and white light.



I felt a surge rise in my stomach. Awe. Fern’s feelings, I realized. I could almost picture him next to me, gazing at the orb.



“Wow, you taught yourself this magic?” I asked, confused about how the whole magic system worked here in this world.



“This one has been on my list to master before we go off to school! Now that we are fourteen, I wanted to make sure I was gonna be at the top of the freshmen class and ahead of Lotty.” Rosie pulled Lotrick into a side hug and tossed his hair.



“You’re fourteen?” I blurted out at Lotrick.



They both stared at me, confused. I spoke without thinking.



“Just kidding,” I said while scratching my head, acting dumb. They ignored it and continued walking down the ramp. They talked about classes and supplies they planned on getting.



—*‘What was that about? I specifically told you to behave normally so you don’t get caught,’* Fern scolded.



—*Hey, you’re not the one thrown into a whole new world with new physics, magic, people with crazy hair colors, and freaking beastmen. Cut me some slack, kid.* I snapped back. Fern may be a teenager, but I’m a full-blown adult, or rather, I was. Still, I won’t let a child chastise me.



—*‘Well, at least you’re not trapped in some dark void watching someone else control your own body, pretend to be you, and mess everything up!’* He shouted back. His voice echoed inside my head like I was in a cave.



That’s right, he is a teenager. He’s scared just as much as I was. I hoped he couldn’t hear all my thoughts.



—*You’re right, I am sorry you’re in that position. I’ll get you out eventually, I swear,* I said, adding to my list of promises. First Noah, now Fern.



—*‘It’s... fine,’* he muttered.



Before I could respond, Rosie grabbed my arm and pulled me down the rest of the ramp. “Come on, Fern! Your brother needs your help.”



I looked up to see Lotrick already far ahead of me at the crescent-shaped counter. Several beastmen assistants brought him supply after supplies. I hurried over and started stuffing the items into an empty backpack one of the cat boys had brought over.



Several wrapped packs of what I assumed was paper, a pack of spices, four empty glass vials wrapped in protective wrapping, two vials of ink, one golden pen, and a dozen other random oddities Lotrick had ordered filled the bag. A silver rapier with a bright gold hilt rested in a glass case. I tied the rapier’s case to the side of the backpack. My hands acted like I was back in the warehouse, trying to fit each item into a box, optimizing the space.



As I worked, Lotrick engaged in conversation with an older man who stood behind the counter. He had long, curly gray hair that draped elegantly over his shoulders, small pointed cat ears that poked out the top of his head, and a short stubby tail that wiggled as he barked orders to a nearby Cat-girl. I assumed this was the head Cat-man in charge, Master Wor.



—*‘Felis-Man, to be specific,’* Fern clarified.



—*Just how much of my thoughts can you hear?* I asked, slightly annoyed. He did not respond.



“Master Lotrick,” Master Wor said, clapping his hands together. “Have you decided on your track at the capital?”



Lotrick smiled and closed his eyes. “Because of my unique abilities, they automatically enrolled me in the Royal Princeguard Track.” He puffed out his chest as he said that last part.



“Hey, me too!” Rosie chimed in, her pink eyes flashed behind her bouncy black hair.



“You? They let you join the Princeguard Track too? That can’t be possible. You can’t even use three elements.”



“Well, it’s true! Just because you can use three sources doesn’t make me any less special. Just wait and see how strong I am when we get there.” She pouted.



“Three is rarer than two. Either way, it doesn’t matter. I’ll definitely become a top mage this way.” Lotrick scoffed as he turned back to Wor. Rosie stomped her feet and flicked her head away from my brother.



I hefted the now-full backpack, surprised at how easily I managed the weight.



—*Hey, Fern, what’s your workout routine?* I joked.



—*‘What? I... I’m not that strong,’* Fern replied, confused.



—*‘Huh? Really? Then, is it because…’*



A hand shoved my shoulder back to the entrance. Lotrick had ended his conversation with Master Wor and headed for the exit. Rosie walked beside him. She had either forgotten her annoyance at Lotrick or moved on. I followed them and took in more of the store on our way out.



—*Man, I wish I could stay. This place seems so interesting,* I thought.



—*‘What’s the point? Not like we can use any of it,’* Fern pouted.



—*Says you. It might help me find Noah. Maybe one of these potions will help get my body back and give you yours.*



—*‘Noah…your brother,’* Fern trailed off. If I could feel his emotions when we saw Rosie, he probably can feel mine right now.



I shook my head and trudged ahead. The enormous jars of earth suspended above kept grabbing my attention, causing me to not watch where I was walking. Distracted, I collided with someone shorter than me. There was a crash as books hit the floor, followed by a barrage of curses as the figure turned around and glared up at me with blue eyes.



A boy, about Lotrick’s age, dressed in expensive-looking clothing, stared up at me, seething.



“You absolute imbecile!” he spat, brushing off his jacket. “Do you have any idea who you’ve just assaulted?”



Two other boys rushed to his side and asked if he was hurt.



“I’m fine,” the boy snapped, waving them off. His eyes narrowed as they landed on my chest, where my shirt gaped open. “Well, well. What do we have here? A Voidblood dares to soil my presence?”



Lotrick turned around, his face coated with annoyance. Rosie hovered by his side, looking worried.



“Carlyle,” Lotrick said, his voice flat. “Excuse my fool of a brother. He has been acting rather off today. Fern, apologize immediately.”



Carlyle sneered, gesturing at the books on the floor and the new scuff mark on his shoes. “I should have known you’d be involved in this attack on me, Lotrick.” He spit on the ground. “This filth has ruined my new boots. I think it’s only fitting that he cleans them. With his tongue.”



I felt a surge of anger, both my own and Fern’s.



In my head, Fern’s voice rang out.



—*‘We should probably do what he says.’*



—*Are you kidding me? Absolutely not.*



“Hey, kid. It was an accident,” I said, my voice low and controlled. “How about you chill out? I’ll pick up your books though.” I bent down to grab the books when Carlyle put one boot on my back. I winced as his heel twisted my skin. I looked over my shoulder up at him.



Carlyle’s face turned an ugly shade of red. “You dare speak to me that way?” His voice rose, and he started digging his heel into my spine. “I’m giving you one more chance, Voidblood. Clean my shoes, or else.”



Something snapped inside me. I stood up quickly, causing Carlyle to back up. “Oh, yeah? I’m all about the ‘or else’ right now.” I stepped closer, my fists clenching at my sides. I leaned down over him and furrowed my eyebrows. “Let’s do this outside. I bet I can beat your ass with these Voidblood hands.”



—*‘Erik, what the hell?’* Fern screamed. I ignored.



Carlyle’s friends whooped and hollered. “Yeah, roast him alive, Carlyle!” One cheered.



“Show him where Voidbloods belong!” Another egged on.



The spoiled brat’s eyes glinted with malice. “You’ll regret this. Lotrick, your brother is an idiot. Let’s see what you’ve got, Voidblood.”



This was probably a bad idea, but I’d be damned if I let some punk, no, a damn kid, push me around.",1,1731083539.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I’m not too worried about him thinking I’m trying to kiss ass at work. He’s the boss of only me and one other person, and this other person is also a grown man. They see each other more anyways (I work an hour away) and their kids are friends.

I went in at 7am Nov 7th to remove my gallbladder (stones) and the surgery was done in an hour and I was set to go home same day. I didnt do any pain medication other than Tylenol when I woke up. I had some nausea and a little bile came up but very minimal. 

The most frustrating part was waking up from anesthesia. My blood pressure wouldnt go over 80/45 and I kept falling asleep in bed, I couldnt keep my eyes open. I drank soda, gatorade, had snacks, still would fall asleep. I didnt leave until 1pm because I just didnt feel comfortable going home with such a low blood pressure and being so sleepy. I wasnt dizzy at all, and I walked to the bathroom with assistance a few times to pee.

Since I wasn't dizzy and I was walking fine the surgeon said I could go home even though I had such a low blood pressure. I took 500mg of ibuprofen before bed last night ""just in case"" and I slept from 8pm-4am and then from 6am - 8am. I'm having coffee now but still haven't pooped :(

No pain really, I dont need any pain meds. Just feels like I did a good ab workout yesterday. It is really tough getting in and out of bed, I would suggest most people get some sort of help for that if they dont have someone at home like me.

Another hard part has been my dog. Shes 15 lbs and doesnt understand why I cant bend over to pet her or pick her up like I usually do. Shes by my side in bed now, and I have a pillow on my stomach so she doesnt go near it, but I can tell shes all confused and mopey!!

I cant lift more than 5 lbs for 4 weeks and I cant have more than 13g fat a day for 2 weeks, and then slowly increase fat after that. I plan on doing some walking after resting a bunch this weekend, but that's it for physical activity. I dont want to push it even tho im not in pain and feeling ok.

1gmmcsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1gmmcsj/returning_to_twin_peaks_s3e6_dont_die/,"Returning to Twin Peaks [S3E6, Don't Die]","I must admit this episode sorely tried my patience. I'm very open to Lynch's explorations and meditative storytelling (especially taking into account that this was filmed as an 18-hour film). But a lot of the plotlines in this particular episode felt like isolated Lynch 'sketches' at best, and filler at worst. Not all! But a lot. 

We start off with Dougie, who gets a strange vision from MIKE begging him not to die. Um... okay? No shit. Even if he was capable of understanding, that's not saying anything. How about helping? Last I checked, MIKE still has a physical body. Can't he pop out of the Black Lodge and do something? 

The only way this scene makes sense to me is that it's an emotional outburst from MIKE, who has apparently become very fond of Cooper. Which is a neat idea, but of course they never really do anything with it. Despite having many scenes in The Return, MIKE remains an underexplored character. 

Not much to say about the insurance fraud sequence, other than Dougie is *massively* lucky that Bushnell had the patience to make sense of his scribbles. The actor playing Bushnell is doing a terrific job, he's so charming. 

We get our first glimpse of Diane, as played by Laura Dern. I must confess that Diane is an aspect of The Return that doesn't work for me. Mainly the fact that she's presented as a romantic interest to Cooper. It just doesn't jive with the way Cooper talked to her in the original series at all. Even when he was dying (in the s2 premiere), what he told Diane was ""I would very much like to make love to a beautiful woman"" in a detached sort of way. The impression I got was that they had a sibling type relationship. On a lesser note, I'm not really a fan of the way Diane is presented either. The whole 'fuck you' shtick isn't endearing, and I can't imagine her ever being Coop's secretary.

1. I know she's only a tulpa, but she was still convincing enough for Albert/Gordon and seemed to have all the memories of the real Diane.

2.  I know it's supposed be 25 years later, but Lynch/Frost are obviously counting on the audience being interested in Diane based on the original show. So there should be a connection there. At least have a box of Cooper's old tapes and files lying around. 

At a risk of offending Laura Dern fans, I kinda wish she and Naomi Watts were switched around. Naomi was tough as nails too, but also wide-eyed, sweet and loyal, qualities which instantly harken back to classic Cooper. Meanwhile, I could totally imagine Laura's Diane being married to the first Dougie Jones and telling Daniel Faraday from LOST to fuck off. Just a thought. 

There's a very bizarre scene where a gangster named ""Red"" is interacting with Richard Horne (I didn't really understand what about). The menace that Richard built up in the Roadhouse is instantly destroyed here. I thought he was supposed to be this uncontrollable psychopath? Why is he trying to please some two-bit hoodlum who is essentially just a parody version of Bobby Briggs? Richard is 25 and has a cop on his side, shouldn't he be running his own gang by now? 

Also, given that Richard freaks out over killing a kid, I guess he's not that tough. It doesn't seem like panic over the cops, he comes off as being genuinely horrified, and keeps blaming the kid to deflect. 

The episode's one big shining light was Harry Dean Stanton. I don't think I need to say anything about his performance, everything about it was beautiful. The child's death was very hard hitting and I don't want to get into that either, but I loved the detail of the golden light passing safely through the web of electric cables untouched. I thought that was one of Lynch's best images. 

NOTES: 

* ""Jade give two rides!"" ""I'LL BET SHE DID!"" I love Janey-E, she's hilarious. 
* Loved to see Albert with the trenchcoat again. Shame the Black Lodge melted Cooper's. 
* ""Gene Kelly, you motherfucker!"" Albert making an old movie reference? I didn't get it.
* Is the Packard sawmill still operating? There was a shot with chopped wood stacked everywhere. 
* I couldn't help but crack up at that one driver whose reaction to the kid's death was just a facepalm. 
* I was distracted during Spike's scene, because his theme song is from that godawful Super Seducer video game. 
* Dougie's shit-eating grin in the elevator was priceless. He definitely has at least some self-awareness. 
* I wonder if Bushnell's ""tougher than the rest!"" boxing poster is meant to infer that Bushnell is a better person than most. 
* Lol at Chad walking into the bathroom with a coffee cup and book. 
* Chad should've been fired the minute he made that remark about Frank's wife. They wouldn't have stood for that in Harry's time. Albert made a few snarky asides and he got clocked. ",3,1731082819.0,twinpeaks,4,0.71,False

I even said that if he cant afford it i will pay for the dates as long as he wants to go out.

I told him what i was asking for is super simple but he sees it as a big deal and says he doesnt want to be like other couples.

I used to fast 4-5 years ago and it was so effective but ever since I got diagnosed with PCOD I haven't been able to lose weight no matter what I do. Doctor prescribed me orlistat which was of no use because my fat intake is not much anyways. 

I have been doing rolling 72s for over 2 weeks now. After 72 hours, I break my fast for 3 hours and then start my fast again. I break my fast with coconut water or tomato soup. I'm a vegetarian so my meal is full of veggies and it also consists of one multigrain flat bread. I also drink a cup of coffee with milk and 1tsp sugar. My meal never exceeds 700 calories. 

I only drink water while fasting and I take some pink salt and lemon water in the morning. I lost SOME weight after my first fast but since then the scale hasn't moved. I gain 0.5 lbs after I eat something and then it goes back to 0 once I fast. I have only lost 2.5 LBS in over 2 weeks and it's becoming so difficult to keep myself motivated. 

I do fitness Marshall workouts for 30 mins everyday so that should help with some weight loss too but idk where exactly I'm making a mistake.
