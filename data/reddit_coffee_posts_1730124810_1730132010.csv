With more and more remote workers travelling around, there are more and more co-working spaced and cafes that are catering specifically to them. And then there are the usual cafes that get seats filled and slowing business.

Would cafes be open to a promoter agreement?

I always build groups of cafe cowork people so that I can socialise and the groups always grow in popularity. I want to reach out to cafe places and offer to host a cowork day to bring more people in.

However, in what way would this appeal to cafe owners? A sort of ""hey, 10 spot cowork at This Cafe. ‚Ç¨x. Includes 2 coffees and sandwich""?

Or would most owners just say nah I'm good?

I've run meetups before but never been the one to contact the venues so I'm not sure the approach

1ge5rpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PresidentialElection/comments/1ge5rpq/we_need_to_have_a_serious_conversation/,We need to have a serious conversation‚Ä¶,"

 With the election only 8 days away (as of the time of me writing this post), I feel like a very important message needs to be shared. 

 A message that not only a staggering (and disappointingly large) majority of this nation desperately needs to hear. But also pretty much the entire world right now, given the current culture war that‚Äôs been escalating as of the past decade. A message that doesn‚Äôt just apply to current politics or this upcoming election but can be applied to future elections and political issues:

 (This is going to be VERY long; I wish it wasn‚Äôt (I don‚Äôt like writing essays), but unfortunately, it seems to be the only way to get my point across with as little room for misinterpretation as possible. I don‚Äôt blame you for not wanting to read all of it, and you don‚Äôt have to. (I‚Äôd be surprised if you did) But if you do choose to engage with it, I‚Äôd sincerely appreciate some of your time. Sit back- grab a snack, this will be a long one.)

 As I‚Äôm pretty sure you are all well aware, our nation (and by extension, most of the world) is currently undergoing a significant cultural and social schism. Between more conservative attitudes and more liberal attitudes. For decades, but even more so in the past decade, the two sociocultural classes have clashed, argued, and fought and beat each other bloody over specific issues, values, and political differences. This division is not merely just a political conflict; it is a fundamental error in how we perceive each other as fellow citizens.

 The two-party system in this country only serves to worsen and exacerbate this divide by promoting en masse political binaries. It also doesn‚Äôt help that most key issues and policies that are often considered controversial or divisive are used as ideological crutches by these parties. These issues are used as social tools for their own gain‚Äîto sway people to their side of the political spectrum‚Äîand to form as large of a following and voter base as possible. This phenomenon is especially prevalent right now, as with most election years.

 It doesn‚Äôt help either that mainstream media, social media platforms, and influencers hitch a ride on this partisan train of division and are a massive contributor to it. Using their own resources, following, and viewer bases to spread and promote a specific political agenda, to sway their viewer bases into believing biased rhetoric or propaganda, and castigating their political ‚Äúopponents‚Äù to the point where they go beyond natural bias. This deliberate distortion of the truth serves to fondle the minds of their viewers by telling them exactly what they want to hear and discouraging them from seeking out or considering anything they perceive as opposition to their agenda. Not just to push an agenda, but to also certify their viewer bases and pull in further money.

 The combination of both has, over time, brewed a boiling coffee pot of severe political and social discourse and resentment between people in this nation. Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, often perceive their ‚Äúopposition‚Äù as (ahem): mentally incompetent, idiotic, morally bankrupt, delusional, evil, sinful, malicious, or even a fundamental threat to their own livelihoods.

 Ask any liberal or conservative what their perspective or thoughts are on the other, and you likely are not going to get a pleasant response. But why? Easy. Due to the conditioning by the MSM, social media, and even our own government at times, each side has been fervently brainwashed and manipulated into believing that any form of ideological or political contrast from their perspective is a fundamental attack on their own personhood and identity.

 Democrats and Republicans have been conditioned and manipulated to absolutely despise each other. Beyond rationality, beyond even basic respect. They have been conditioned to believe the other as stupid and morally bankrupt. They‚Äôve even been conditioned and manipulated to believe that their opponents are so stupid, so evil, so malicious, and so incompetent‚Äîthat they are somehow a fundamental threat to your values and livelihood.

 This takes advantage of the naturally tribalistic nature of humans‚Äîwe tend to form social groups to categorize and divide ourselves‚Äîand since we typically only ever associate with those that are most similar to us (humans are naturally fearful and inconsiderate of what is unfamiliar or what they don‚Äôt know), this is fertile soil for ideological and social conflict.

 Both parties regularly, en masse, dehumanize the other‚Äîsometimes to such extremes that if you‚Äôre (for example) a liberal or Democrat or Republican or conservative, you often perceive the supposed opposition as so incompetent, malicious, or even threatening that you begin to develop a sense of moral and ideological superiority over them. This belief can create a dangerous cycle where empathy is lost, and dialogue is replaced with hostility.

 You refuse to consider any valid perspectives or thoughts they may share; you refuse to ever engage in discussion outside of blatant castigation. You refuse to even associate with such individuals and may actively seek to attack or demean any that you come across, whether in real life or online. This polarization is a fundamental threat to what it means to be tolerant and understanding.

 In a way, you can‚Äôt really be blamed for such thinking; after all, if you‚Äôve been told over and over and over to think that a specific group of people or ideology is so stupid, corrupt, or even a fundamental threat to anything you know or love, it makes sense why people choose to behave in such ways. 

 It‚Äôs all about self-preservation, is it not? To fight what you see as an attack on your values and life? To resist what is perceived as a fundamental threat to your values and beliefs? Why would you not resist such a threat?

 The recent attempted assassinations on Trump are a perfect example of what happens when you allow such political division to marinate for so long. When you allow your fellow Americans to promote hatred, political bigotry, and bias. When our own government does little to curb this divide, and (intentionally or otherwise) inadvertently widens the chasm. I may not personally like Trump all that much, or agree with all of his policies or stances- but I think we can come to a consensus that even with all the fuck ups he has made- he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be killed- or worse; constantly live in fear of death.

 And this prolonged political violence likely will not end with Trump- what happens if someone tries to assassinate Kamala? What happens if some tries to eliminate both, or one or the other, and is SUCCESSFUL? The potential consequences of either is not something I want to risk witnessing. 


 It‚Äôs not the only example either- January 6th is another BIG example. It's about the apex of what I‚Äôm talking about here. All the political and social conflict, tensions, and corruption that stained 2020 coalesced here- into an insurrection that attempted to overturn an election, violated what it means to live in a constitutional republic- violated what it means to be AMERICAN. To attack our very Capitol, to reign violence over our own politicians and government, that IS NOT what Americans stand for, that‚Äôs not who we are.

 I don‚Äôt fully blame Trump for that day- he didn‚Äôt order them to attack anything, simply to just peacefully protest. But they chose to not listen and take matters into ‚Äúthier own hands‚Äù. THE prime fault for that attack is on the rioters themselves, who CHOSE to violate what it means to be an AMERICAN in the name of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. Who chose to abandon thier morals and values to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù their country against a threat that didn‚Äôt exist. I don‚Äôt BLAME Trump for the attack- but I also WILL NOT ignore Trump‚Äôs indirect involvement. His rhetoric about the election being ‚Äústolen‚Äù for the previous 3 months, all that did was fuel further division among voters, and led to the mindset that those people had as a justification to do what they did.

 Those two are ALL prime examples of how the political climate in this nation leads to violence and sometimes persecution. How when we LET ourselves be reduced to mere labels, mere parties, mere boxes on a ballot- our strength as Americans- as fellow human beings, becomes under jeopardy. But that‚Äôs besides the point.


 Currently, this political Cold War is so prevalent that it‚Äôs ruined friendships, broken up families, ruined relationships, and caused political violence and persecution. And that, for me, is saddening because it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. We don‚Äôt have to be this way.

 We are one nation‚Äîthe United States of America. We are all citizens of a flawed yet wonderful nation. And we are letting our own biases and greed divide us, letting it stain what it means to be an American‚Äîto live in peace, tolerance, and prosperity. To look at our fellow brothers and sisters not with hatred or contempt, but with brotherhood and compassion. 

 To view opposing ideas and beliefs not as threats or insults but as interesting new perspectives to be respectfully explored and discussed. To open our minds and hearts to what we have been told and told and told over and over again to close them to‚Äîto shut ourselves off‚Äîand to swallow the incessant lies and divisive rhetoric that our government and media intentionally spin to suit their own gain. We mustn‚Äôt let ourselves slip into the patterns of hatred and evil.

 Conservatives are not evil, liberals are not evil, Democrats are not evil, Republicans are not evil‚Äîthey are groups of good minded, working people who have different ideas and perspectives about how things should be run around here. It doesn‚Äôt make anyone wrong, or morally bankrupt, to believe differently than you. We must swallow the hard pill of a fact; that differing perspectives are a natural part of a healthy democracy.

 It‚Äôs not an ‚Äúattack‚Äù on your identity or livelihood for others to disagree with you. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù for someone to perceive reality differently than you do. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúdisrespect‚Äù to someone to vote differently than you. And the fact that many people seem to think this is honestly not disappointing- but plain depressing and idiotic. This is NOT what we are, this is NOT what America is- I will NOT let us continue down this path of self destruction framed as ‚Äúactivism‚Äù or ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù.

 How boring would this world be if we all believed the same thing? Very. No new ideas‚Äîno discussions over important topics. progress would stall, and innovation would cease.

 We need to relearn how to not just tolerate different perspectives but learn how to embrace them. This requires a commitment to empathy, and willingness to engage in constructive discussion- something many of us actively REFUSE to do. And to be frank I am tired of it. I am sick and tired of seeing people REDUCED to barking rabid dogs behind screens that can‚Äôt be bothered to give a singular shit about anyone other than themselves, and refuse to consider any ideas because they are TERRIFIED of considering ANYTHING that may change their perspective on things.

 Maybe if some of you would actually put your fucking pride aside and quit trying to defend your beliefs like it‚Äôs the goddamn Crown of England. Maybe you‚Äôd actually learn something for one in your life- maybe you‚Äôd hear something that (god forbid oh so scary) challenges your perspective on life for once. Imagine an America where we did THAT- and not whatever this crap is we‚Äôre doing now. Imagine THAT.


 Imagine what would happen if the people of this nation actually put their differences aside and worked towards REAL, PRACTICAL solutions‚Äîto find solutions that benefit everyone and not just one party or demographic. Imagine an America where Democrats and Republicans shook hands and were friends with each other. 

 Imagine us working together as ONE to find common ground and improve things. Imagine an America, where we focused on issues that MATTER- issues that affect all of us- not some of us. Imagine us working to reduce inflation, reduce federal taxes, provide food and water and resources for the needy- allocate resources where it‚Äôs needed most, help our allies defend themselves but also work to end existing conflicts and promote international peace and cooperation. Because the biggest determinant of a nation‚Äôs strength is not how it treats the WEALTHY, but how it treats its WEAKEST members.

 Imagine an America where there is equality for ALL genders, ethnicities, and sexualities. No one has any power or influence over the other. 

 Imagine an America where we focused on healthcare for those that truly need it and worked to make insurance and healthcare affordable.

 Imagine an America where we actually worked to eliminate drug and child trafficking, where we worked to eliminate deaths by drug overdose and heal the trauma inflicted by those who choose to exploit and abuse.

 Imagine an America, where we focused on mental health- to heal and provide support, not judgment to those who are struggling. And work to provide healing to those who have been hurt. After all- we have a massive gun violence issue here in this country- and the main proprietor is poverty and mental health issues. A gun doesn‚Äôt do anything unless someone picks it up with the intention to use it. Why not make people stop WANTING to USE THEM?

 Imagine an America where we innovated in science and technology. Invest in the development of AI, but be careful of its evolution and regulate it so it doesn‚Äôt one day try to kill us. Why not use technologies like CRISPR to cure people with incurable genetic diseases. Why not invest in technologies like Neuralink to allow for seamless integration of the human mind and digital realm- allow us to understand our own brains better to develop cures for those who struggle from neurological conditions and mental illness? Why not invest more funding into cancer and Alzheimer‚Äôs research- so we can FINALLY rid our species of these terrible diseases that take innocent lives and tear apart families. We haven‚Äôt been back to the moon in 50 years- why not go back? Establish a stable, sufficient human presence outside of Earth to prepare for what will inevitably be the future of our species.

 This nation has issues, no doubt about that‚Äîour economy is a mess right now, our policies are hot shit, and our citizen base is in shambles‚Äîbut it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. We have the power to change this, to embolden ourselves to find real, practical solutions that benefit EVERYONE.

 I have friends that are Harris voters and friends that are Trump voters. I don't attack or dehumanize them; I listen to them and consider BOTH of their perspectives and accept them for who they are. Not who I wish they would be. I find common ground and mutual respect. Something that we must learn how to do if we wish to change things for the better.

 Both sides genuinely want what they think is best based on their own analysis and perspectives‚Äîno one is malicious (hopefully), just two ideologies that should peacefully coexist, but they don't, and that‚Äôs an issue.

 Even Kamala and Trump‚Äîboth are not the best people, that‚Äôs obvious‚Äîboth are willing to lie, swindle, spread misinformation, and cheat to get what they want. (They‚Äôre politicians, are you surprised?) But they are nowhere near as awful as MSM makes them out to be.

 Now granted- thier flaws and biases affect a LOT of stuff given how much power they have. But with all the mistakes and fuck ups that Trump, Biden, and Harris have done- they are not irredeemable. They not ‚Äúdemons‚Äù or ‚Äúincarnations of Hitler or Stalin‚Äù, they are powerful people who want what they think is best, but trip up sometimes- sometimes badly- but that‚Äôs what happens when you have a lot of power, things happen, the important thing is cleaning up any mess you leave behind- apologize to those you have hurt and strive to learn and be better because of your mistakes. They are bad sometimes, but they have a capacity to be better, and so do we.

If you want my advice: Don‚Äôt listen to what MSM says about either of them‚ÄîTrump isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúthreat to our democracy,‚Äù and Kamala isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcommunist dictator‚Äù. They‚Äôre both willing to do bad things to gain power, yes, but they‚Äôre not inherently evil. They both genuinely want what THEY think is best based on their perspectives.Neither side is ‚ÄúeViL‚Äù, is two people (not very great people but anyway) that want to fix the nation in the way they think will best suit us.


 At this point, you may be wondering why this is even remotely important‚Äîwhy should we put aside our political differences and unite? Why should YOU consider the perspectives of those who think different? After all, aren‚Äôt they threats to your values and interests? Well. The answer is simple: because TOGETHER we are STRONG.

 Divided, we are vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation. Why do you think other nations like China, Iran, and Russia love to meddle here? Mess with our politics and sway the masses? Because they know America is powerful- but only if it stands together and proud. If they can weaken our unity, and force cracks in our society, that gives them fertile ground to do whatever they want. A divided America is a weak America and they know that. We‚Äôre too busy fighting amongst OURSELVES to focus on THEM.

United, we can address the challenges facing our society and build a brighter future for generations to come, we can uphold our values, defend the weak and vulnerable against those who choose to exploit and plunder. We have a choice, America, to stand together and rise above, or give into our own stubbornness and remain fractured.

 We MUST reject the divisive narratives smeared in our faces and shoved down our throats by those who benefit from our division.

 Let‚Äôs create an America where dialogue is ENCOURAGED, where empathy reigns, and where we CELEBRATE instead of CASTIGATE  our differences and achievements. I‚Äôm proud of the good our country has done and embarrassed by the evil it has committed. We aren‚Äôt perfect, no one is, but we can strive to be better. 

 It is time for us to rise above the noise and rhetoric, to embrace our fellow citizens regardless of their political views, to realize that we are not Democrats or Republicans, we are AMERICANS- that must stand equal with one another in unity and love. We must FIGHT this machine that has driven us to balant tribalism. We must hold the people who promote this senseless divisive agenda accountable and DEMAND that they clean up their act. 

 We must (yes I‚Äôm quoting them shut up) ‚Äúunburden ourselves from what has been‚Äù, we must build a better future and reject this old tiring bullshit that has driven our great nation to an internal schism. We need to bring our nation back to its former glory- to TRULY ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù.



 That being said, what advice do I have to offer?  Well, take my words with a grain of salt here, but I think that you should do your own independent, well-informed research about both candidates and both sides of the political spectrum:
Branch out. 

 If you‚Äôre Democrat, watch a bit of Fox News or something to see what they think. Listen to Trump and Vance‚Äôs speeches and rallies to see where they ACTUALLY stand on key issues. 

 If you‚Äôre Republican, watch CNN or ABC to see what they think. Listen to Kamala‚Äôs speeches and rallies to see where she REALLY stands. When doing your own research, never blindly trust MSM or companies for information on candidates; they lie and exaggerate the truth a lot. 

 Only ever reliably trust non-partisan, non-biased sources. Unlike MSM, they don‚Äôt have nearly as much of reason to spin the truth. One I would personally recommend would be: Ground News, Allsides. Both are really good non-partisan sources and are a good starting point.

 As for social issues, be more open and inclusive to other perspectives and ideas; think about it; don‚Äôt shut it out but let it in. Embrace others for what we really are‚Äîcitizens of a great nation that just needs some tending to. 

 We are Americans; it‚Äôs time we finally act like it and prove that we are one people‚Äîthat seek to uphold the values of our constitution  and founding fathers, to fight for freedom, liberty, and rights for all peoples. 

 To see our neighbors not as threats or idiots but as fellow citizens, fellow HUMAN BEINGS, with feelings, emotions, thoughts, and opinions. Who deserve to be treated with respect, care, empathy, and compassion. And that‚Äôs how we need to start acting towards each other.

 Don‚Äôt forget: We are Americans, we stand together, we are in this together, and we must fight for what IS RIGHT- not what THEY tell us is ‚Äúright‚Äù.

 I don‚Äôt believe in conservatism or liberalism; I believe in America and what we, as the symbol for prosperity and freedom on this wet rock in space, must stand for. 

 I want to bridge this divide, I want to heal our nation. I want to stand for a better future. I want to stand for an America that I can confidently say I AM PROUD OF. 

 An America where I feel safe and confident letting my future children and grandchildren grow up in. 

 An America to where I PROUDLY say the Pledge of Allegiance, to salute and stand before our great flag and anthem- because I KNOW what being an American means, and plenty of us still do. But so many of us..even our own leaders..have forgotten- and it‚Äôs about damn time we fix that. Remind them what being an AMERICAN means.




 I‚Äôm positive I will get attacked or downvoted some for what I‚Äôve said here‚Äîand in all honesty that‚Äôs fine with me. I'm not here for attention or approval. Some people just don‚Äôt like criticism or being ‚Äúcalled out.""

  
I‚Äôm not trying to insult or castigate anyone here, more just offer constructive criticism. So that way we know as Americans where we should be improving- not just our nation but OURSELVES- our own behavior. We aren‚Äôt perfect obviously- and I don‚Äôt think we should be (or that it‚Äôs possible anyway), but we can definitely strive to be better than how we are now. Strive to be more understanding, more compassionate, more open, more productive, more humble, more kind to one another.

 If you don‚Äôt wanna consider what I‚Äôve said here or choose to ignore it. That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm honestly impressed you read any of this. But I highly encourage you, if you‚Äôve made it this far (good job you actually read all of that), to follow my advice. To work towards an America of prosperity and freedom, an America of love and peace, an America that we can look at and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm PROUD to be an American‚Äù.
Because like it or not, you CANNOT deny this truth: United we stand, divided we fall.

 Anyway, my hands hurt, I have a headache, the point is made, and I‚Äôm tired of typing.

1ge5e9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ge5e9h/6_months_since_breaking_nc_and_debating_reaching/,6 months since breaking NC and debating reaching out. ,"I dated a girl for a few months at the end of last year into February. She was amazing. A few months before I met her I was stood up, cheated on and ghosted by my previous ex. I got a call from her in January and became insecure and acted like an asshole. I wasn't able to communicate with her for some reason or apologize because my ex told me I was weak.

Towards the end I really blew it where I know she wanted more emotional availability from me and I probably made it seem like I didn't care about her. First by not going with her during our talk after an argument when she said she had to go home and asked me to sleepover and second when she called to end things, she gave me the choice to just call it there or talk later and I asked if she wanted her stuff back and she called me an asshole.

She told me I needed to go to therapy, drank too much and that she didn't want to be a fixer. I spent the next 3 months sober and in therapy and then decided to reach out. She immediately agreed to meet but as friendly friends. I took my friends advice and met her for coffee anyways.

The friends comment got in my head and I was terrified going into it expecting to fail. She asked me how I‚Äôd changed immediately and I said I‚Äôd been going to therapy and wasn‚Äôt drinking. She told me she had been blacking out and only told me I needed to go to therapy because she was drunk. I told her that didn‚Äôt matter I needed to hear it. She asked one more time why I went to therapy and I said because I couldn‚Äôt communicate with her.¬†

She then brought up multiple times she couldn‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt bring my new dog. She made a comment about the types of people in my neighborhood and then goes well the guys aren‚Äôt that bad. Then I made a comment about my dog being cute and she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cute‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was flirting with me or patronizing me. In my mindset I shut down believed I was defeated, never flirted or mentioned trying again and walked away and never contacted her again.¬†

I stayed in therapy even after that disheartening comment. I understand I wasn't ready to meet with her when I did and it set back my healing process. I'm now at a point where I am ready to communicate and feel like I understand myself and can be emotionally available. But I keep thinking of her and I know she's single.

I‚Äôm not sure if it is worth reaching out since I really am a different person now than I was. She was the catalyst that got me to really overcome everything I was harboring from childhood and the past relationship. Logically I know I should leave her alone and the damage is done. But a part of me wants to do one last Hail Mary and I‚Äôll be okay with the outcome either way at least knowing I actually said what I wanted to. Its been almost 6 months since I met with her and 10 since things ended.

It wasn‚Äôt the actual day, but it was the day I (F33) and my boyfriend (M39) set aside to celebrate. We both work together and have crazy schedules, and we‚Äôre both working on my actual birthday. 

So for context, the day before my boyfriend admitted to me he was in a bad headspace and was feeling shitty about a project he‚Äôd been working on for work. He was trying to launch a YouTube channel and filmed the first video and hated it. He asked what our plans were for my birthday, seemingly to ask if he might have time to work on it before we got into our day. I offered that we reschedule everything and take the day to work on the video instead. We had a day of things planned, but nothing set in stone. I also feel like I know my boyfriend and know how he is when he‚Äôs stressed and down. I felt like he‚Äôd be fixated on it and stressed the entire day, so I thought taking some time to work on it would make for a better day overall because he‚Äôd be less stressed. 

When I brought this suggestion up though, he got pissed saying that I always make things about me and that we would absolutely not be giving up my birthday to work on his video. I argued my point that I felt he‚Äôd be stressed all day and I was trying to help. I told him I understood and then tried to move the conversation onto a brighter topic which was our plans for the next day. I asked if he wanted to talk about it and he was kind of short and like ‚Äúwhat is there to talk about.‚Äù I explained I had made some reservations and come up with a plan for the day and wanted to talk to him about it. I commented on he didn‚Äôt seem to be interested in talking about it and that sort of sucked. I don‚Äôt remember everything we said, but the conversation got heated and he started yelling and told me to leave him alone and stop ‚Äúcoming at him‚Äù with more things that are ‚Äúhis fault‚Äù or that he‚Äôs failing at. I tried to follow him into our bedroom when he walked away from me to apologize and he yelled and told me to leave him alone. 

The next morning, I asked if we could talk and I apologized. I knew that I should have been more understanding of his situation. That he‚Äôd had a long, bad day and was in a bad headspace. So I could have waited for him to have something to drink (non-alcoholic, we don‚Äôt drink) or eat and relax for a bit before coming at him with my own wants. I apologized and then again asked if he wanted to talk about the day. He was looking at his phone and gave me a halfhearted ‚Äúsure.‚Äù We had been talking about vulnerability and I realized I hadn‚Äôt talked about my feeling surrounding my birthday. I often get blue around my birthday and see it as a time that I feel people really show you how much you matter in their life. I know it‚Äôs not completely logical. I tried to open up about that but he sort of mocked me. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what he said. But I know him. It wasn‚Äôt his normal self. He seemed on the defensive and only interested in not being to blame for something. 

I was basically trying to say, if you don‚Äôt want to hang out with me today or if you‚Äôre in a bad mood, maybe you should stay behind. This is something he‚Äôs said to me on multiple occasions when I‚Äôve been ‚Äúmaking something all about me‚Äù and being dramatic. He said he still wanted to come so we got ready and left for our day. 

The entire day felt tense and forced. I felt like I tried to initiate conversation all day and was only getting short, one-word replies. We went to a cute Halloween town for lunch and walked around. Outside of barely speaking, he didn‚Äôt come into any shops with me and walked behind me the entire day. I asked once or twice if we were ok and if was ok and each time he said yes. 

I cried silently in the car on the way home. I was so confused and just feeling sorry for myself. When we got home, I thanked him for lunch and for the coffee he bought me. He went into his bathroom (which is normal) and I grabbed our bowl and went outside for a toke. I sat outside alone for about 45 minutes. Normally he would have come out and  sat with me and gotten high and we would have talked. I went inside and he was sitting in his office playing a game on his phone. I asked if he‚Äôd come out and talk with me or just hang out and he said that he didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea. Me being stoned and him being sober isn‚Äôt a good combination, he said. I respected it and told him I‚Äôd still like to hang out with him and said I‚Äôd happily drink coffee and try to sober up if he‚Äôd like. He told me he‚Äôd come out in a while. And he never did. He moved into our bedroom and around 9:30pm I came in to confront him. I explained my perspective on the past 48 hours, which is essentially everything I wrote above. And he said that once again, I‚Äôm blaming him for everything and not taking any responsibility of my own actions and that I speak as if everything I say is the only truth. The conversation devolved. There were a lot of tears on my end. At the end, he said ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt working, this is all our relationship ever is, today sucked and it wasn‚Äôt supposed to, our relationship is broken.‚Äù I asked if he wanted to keep working on fixing it. He said he doesn‚Äôt know how to. He then got up and ate some food and went to bed. I stayed up and cried my eyes out before eating some ice cream and watching Hocus Pocus until I fell asleep.

She agreed but ignored my suggestions and asked to go to Aha Cafe. I didn't mind but was surprised she agreed to meet right away.

Anyway, after reading several reviews on Aha Cafe, I found out that it's a scam hub... they hire girls to bring foreigners from dating apps and overcharge them. There are also bars that do that, not just this place.

I told her I don't feel comfortable about that cafe because of the scam related reviews and gave her an alternative cafe. She again ignored my pick and suggested another place lol, so I cancelled the date politely after addressing my concerns and she didn't even try to defend. 

So guys please watch out, not every girl shows interest in you, wanna date you. I also read that local deal with similar scams but tourists are more targeted.",3,1730130212.0,VietNam,2,0.8,False

1ge55gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ge55gb/the_girl_in_402_part_1/,The Girl in 402 [Part 1],"I knew one day I would have to tell this story. It took me a year to finally sit down and do it. I‚Äôve been told that doing this could help me move on, but that‚Äôs not what this is for. I don‚Äôt expect to move on. The girl in 402 will always be with me. I‚Äôm telling this story, simply, because I have to.

¬†

I lived there for two years. It was a tiny little unit, tucked away on the very right of the fourth floor. Bachelor is almost generous. It was the kind of dingy place that never looks bright no matter how many lights you have on, but I liked it. I‚Äôm good with a small space, I enjoy not having that much to take care of. I could do without the bug problems, the leaks, the electrical problems, and the rotten smells that just sort of happen, but it is what it is.

¬†

There was a level of comfort, as well, to living on the fourth floor. Nobody robs a random fourth floor apartment unit. Nobody can peek into your window. It‚Äôs unlikely to get shot at‚Ä¶ Yeah, I lived in one of those kinds of cities. You didn‚Äôt walk around at night if you could help it. You just didn‚Äôt.

¬†

I got accustomed to noise there. The cars, the sirens, the dogs barking, the shouting, the occasional echoing pop of a gunshot. It all becomes a whirling auditory soup. I learned to tune it out fairly quickly. In fact, I learned to tune out a lot of things.

¬†

I was in one of those periods of life that I think some people call ‚Äúthe grind‚Äù but really it‚Äôs more like being beaten into submission. Working to live, living to work ‚Äì not living at all, just continuing to exist. All of this to say, I wasn‚Äôt very perceptive or sociable at this time. I was sleepwalking and daydreaming through life.

¬†

I‚Äôd say I could do my routine blindfolded except for the fact that I would stub my toe in the same spot on the coffee table 4 times a week at least. Funny how that works. I guess that was part of the routine too. But that‚Äôs what I mean about not being perceptive. The building could‚Äôve caught fire and most days I probably wouldn‚Äôt have noticed until I actually went up in flames. I didn‚Äôt retain any faces I saw or names I heard. It was all just a blur, each day blending into the next. Until one night.

¬†

I got home from work like usual in the evening as the sun began to descend past the buildings. I couldn‚Äôt afford a car, but thankfully my work was close enough to walk to. The days were getting shorter now so my walks home became more brisk.

¬†

The apartment still smelled of dust and paint as they had finally sent someone to replace a moldy bit of wall the day before. I could still feel the sensation of dust collecting on my tongue when I opened my mouth and it getting sucked into my nose with every inhale. The smell of paint was strong, but infinitely better than some of the other smells.

¬†

I opened the window to attempt to ventilate the place, I emptied the bucket of rust coloured water collecting in the bathroom (they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to fix that as well), and I collapsed onto my bed. This was my ritual. After every work day, I would always take 10-15 minutes to just spread out on my bed like a cat and decompress from everything. But tonight, after about two minutes, I heard a noise.

¬†

This noise stood out from all the outdoor soup because it sounded a lot closer, and it sounded like a voice. A soft, feminine voice; making some kind of subtle moan or whimper. I froze in place. It startled me. It sounded SO close. Like it might be in the room. I didn‚Äôt move a muscle; I didn‚Äôt want to make a noise. I wanted to hear it again so I could tell where it was coming from. For a second I thought it might be coming from under my bed.

¬†

After a few seconds, the sound repeated. A faint, girly whimper. A bit louder than the last one. This time I could tell where it was coming from. It was behind me. Specifically, the other side of the wall behind my bed. That gave me some relief. It was my neighbor.

¬†

But then I was confused. I didn‚Äôt remember EVER hearing my neighbor making noise before. If I could suddenly hear a noise that soft, that mild, why couldn‚Äôt I hear anything before? Did I even have a neighbor before? Is this person new? I felt a rush of shame at just how detached I had become.

¬†

I reached back into my mind to try and recall any memories I had about my neighbor. I couldn‚Äôt find a single one. I remembered some people being on my floor, but I couldn‚Äôt remember ever seeing anyone enter or exit the door next to mine. I did, however, recall seeing people yesterday morning trying to move a couch up the stairs in the lobby. It was a fairly regular occurrence to see things like this. People rotated in and out of this place all the time. I suppose nobody else really wanted to stick around that long, and I can see why. But I guess that answers it. As peculiar as it is, I didn‚Äôt have a neighbor before - for two years - and now I do. And now they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ whimpering? Why are they whimpering?

¬†

Slowly these sporadic whimpers become more defined sobs. A woman was crying. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I just decided to be as quiet as possible and put on some headphones to let them have their privacy and spare myself from feeling any more awkward. It felt wrong to hear this, and I immediately felt bad for this person. I made sure to play some extra loud music.

¬†

About an hour later, I removed my headphones and the noises had stopped in the interim. I very briefly debated going over and telling them about how thin the walls apparently are, but I made the much easier decision to wait. Wait until they do something loud and not so private so I can use that as the excuse. Like the TV or something. I was weighing my options. But I couldn‚Äôt talk to them about THIS. I couldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúHey you were crying real loud over there.‚Äù

¬†

The rest of the night was quiet but I didn‚Äôt have the best sleep. This disturbance in the routine, and the thought of having to face this person at some point was giving me some anxiety. By the morning, however, the alarm kicked me back into the routine. I heard no noises from the neighbor, so life resumed.

¬†

I got back home from work that night, much later than usual because someone decided to no-show at work. Walking home in the dark made me paranoid and I hated days when this happened. When I got inside I was relieved, and the dust and paint were not nearly as oppressive to the senses this time. I did the window, the water bucket, and then collapsed on the bed like clockwork. What happened yesterday was still on my mind, so I made sure to be extra quiet when laying down. After a few seconds of silence, I was ready to try and remove the whole ordeal from my brain. Then I heard the voice.

¬†

I couldn‚Äôt make out the first word I heard from the other side of the wall, but I listened for the rest.

¬†

‚ÄúIt was a poetry book.‚Äù I heard in a muffled but distinctly feminine voice. Quieter than yesterday, I thought. She must be further away from the wall.

¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember exactly.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt always feels like we‚Äôre going somewhere.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs why we see them most at night.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI mixed up our glasses.‚Äù

¬†

There was a moderate gap of a few seconds between everything she said. Clearly, I was only hearing half of a conversation. Phone conversation most likely, or else the other person is just insanely quiet.

¬†

It was difficult to gauge her tone from how muffled the voice was, but there was a kind of melancholy in it. I wondered what was going on, and I kind of laughed at how random the phrases were. I thought about listening further but I stopped myself. It wasn‚Äôt my business. It‚Äôs not for me to hear. I once again thought about going over and letting her know about the noise, but it didn‚Äôt feel like a good time. I put on my headphones once again to try and enjoy the minimal amount of respite I had left in the day, and that was the end of it for that night.

¬†

The third night I got home on time. I was a bit surprised not to hear anything from her at first. I guessed that maybe she went to bed early or went out for the night. It was Friday after all, usually people do things on Friday nights. I still made sure to be quiet when near her wall just in case she was sleeping. I made a mental note to look up how much soundproofing panels cost. I probably should have thought of that earlier.

¬†

I got up from my 15 minute ‚Äúwork sucks‚Äù bed sprawling and headed over to my computer to do that important research, but ‚Äì as I often did ‚Äì I forgot my coffee table exists and I stubbed my toe. The heavy table shifted inches across the wooden floor and pain shot through me like a shockwave. I don‚Äôt remember which expletive left my mouth involuntarily that time, but it was definitely one of them. I was so annoyed. Every damn time. I could just move the table, why don‚Äôt I ever just move the fucking table?

¬†

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù My heart leapt in my chest. I physically jumped back on one leg. I thought she wasn‚Äôt home, and I forgot how close she could sound. It scared the shit out of me. She also spoke quite loudly, she probably assumed it would be harder to hear through the wall than it was.

¬†

‚ÄúOh. Yeah. I‚Äôm good. Sorry. I just stubbed my toe.‚Äù I responded back in a shaky voice.

¬†

¬†‚ÄúShit. That sucks.‚Äù I could hear a chuckle in her voice, she was clearly amused. Her volume decreased to match mine.

¬†

I laughed in return, ‚ÄúIt happens ALL the time‚Ä¶ So sorry to disturb you.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo no it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm just reading‚Ä¶ You sure you‚Äôre good? That sounded violent.‚Äù She responded, sounding half-concerned and half-joking.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, no, I‚Äôm alright. It sounded worse than it was. It‚Äôs a heavy table and‚Ä¶ the walls here-‚Äú I began to explain before she cut me off.

¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre REALLY thin, huh?‚Äù She finished my thought and then continued, ‚ÄúI can hear you so well, that‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôm surprised I didn‚Äôt hear you before now.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah I guess I‚Äôm quiet... And, well, I‚Äôm at work most of the day and get home late. So.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt like how awkward I sounded. I think I forgot how to have normal conversations.

¬†

‚ÄúHas it been noisy for you? I‚Äôm sorry if it was, I didn‚Äôt know. I just moved in.‚Äù She sounded very kind, and friendly. I was taken aback by it a little bit.

¬†

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be sorry and‚Ä¶ Nothing much. I think I probably heard you talking on the phone a bit the other night. I didn‚Äôt listen in or anything, I put on my headphones.‚Äù I explained. I hoped she believed me about the headphones. It was the truth but, it‚Äôs hard to trust that sort of thing. I didn‚Äôt mention the crying, I didn‚Äôt want her to feel awkward or anything.

¬†

‚ÄúOh. Sorry about that...‚Äù She said. I detected a hint of confusion in her voice but I ignored it.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt tell you earlier. I just didn‚Äôt know when it would be a good time and... It‚Äôs new to me too. I didn‚Äôt have a neighbor before, I don‚Äôt think.‚Äù As I spoke, I found it harder to rationalize why I hadn‚Äôt told her before now‚Ä¶ I really should have.

¬†

‚ÄúReally? How long have you been here?‚Äù She asked.

¬†

‚ÄúTwo years.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo one lived here before me for two years? Are you sure?‚Äù She was very perplexed.

¬†

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ Honestly, no, I‚Äôm not sure. I just never heard anyone before, and I never saw anyone before.‚Äù I probably sounded like a total recluse, but I was more interested in why she was so confused.

¬†

‚ÄúOh. That‚Äôs strange‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure there were people living here right before me, at least that‚Äôs what the guy said.‚Äù Her tone had shifted, and what she said sent a bit of a shiver down my spine. It didn‚Äôt make any sense. How could I not hear them, not once, when I can practically hear this woman breathing?

¬†

After a brief silence, she spoke again and returned to a more casual tone ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ Maybe they weren‚Äôt around much. Maybe it was a second home or something. Anyways, sorry again about the noise. I‚Äôll get some soundproofing stuff for my end right away.‚Äù I admired her positivity, and I didn‚Äôt feel any judgment from her for how strange I probably came across. It was really nice. And she had a point about it being a second home. That could be the case. I don‚Äôt know why they would have a second home in this shitty building but‚Ä¶ What else could the explanation be?

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jane by the way. Nice to kind-of meet you.‚Äù She added in a chipper manner. While it was refreshing to have such a pleasant interaction, a small part of me worried about her. She was so carefree and optimistic ‚Äì almost na√Øve. She must be new to the city. I wondered how long it would take before this place whittled away at her trust in humanity. The trust that she seemed to give to me so freely. The thought of her spirits being slowly crushed like mine made me sad.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Leigh. Nice to meet you too.‚Äù A small impulse told me not to give my name, but I decided to reciprocate her trust. ‚ÄúAnd yeah, I‚Äôll soundproof my end too.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHave a good rest of your night. And be careful.‚Äù She said. I found that slightly ominous but then I remembered the toe thing.

¬†

‚ÄúI will.‚Äù I chuckled. ‚ÄúEnjoy your book.‚Äù

¬†

That was my first conversation with the girl in 402. Over that weekend, we spent a lot of time getting acclimated to each others‚Äô presence as we each waited to get our soundproofing. I expected it to be a lot more awkward than it was. I attribute all of that to her. She had a way of making everything seem fine, and almost playful. She would knock on the wall two times and say things like ‚Äúabout to vacuum, sorry‚Äù And ‚Äúmy bad‚Äù when she would make noise. I would follow her lead and do the same two knocks. It was kind of nice.

¬†

Out of the blue on Sunday, she knocked twice and said ‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt hear my neighbors on the other side at all. Only you.‚Äù We pondered over that a bit. She didn‚Äôt seem to sweat it much, but it WAS odd that it was only on one side. These odd things were beginning to stack up. Why just this wall? Why only now? I began to wonder if more odd things have been happening all along and I‚Äôm only starting to notice them now.

¬†

Monday night I got home to find my package had arrived. The soundproofing was here. It was a little bittersweet seeing it on my doorstep. I knocked twice and told her I got it. She confirmed that she got her‚Äôs too. She actually went out and physically bought it. I guess that speaks to the kind of people we are.

¬†

We both said we‚Äôd put it up right away. Both of us not wanting to continue to inconvenience each other any longer‚Ä¶ But then that didn‚Äôt end up happening. Instead we just kept talking. I didn‚Äôt mean to, and I don‚Äôt think she did either, but we just kept finding more to say. The friendly small talk about the building and whatnot gave way to more meaningful conversation. We talked about how we got to where we were. We talked about where we wanted to go from here. I wound up sitting on the floor with my back to her wall and I could her hear words right behind my head as if we were back-to-back. Luckily the paint on that bit of wall was dry by now.

¬†

To her, this place was a fresh start. She didn‚Äôt go into detail, and I didn‚Äôt want to pry, but it was clear that this was some kind of escape from something. Maybe that‚Äôs why she was so upbeat, because she was able to escape a bad situation. Or maybe, she was just always this upbeat.

¬†

She told me that she was going to enroll in the college here, and that she was going to start an online shop, and work as a waitress on the side. Eventually she wanted to open a restaurant. She even told me where, and what the name and theme would be. She told me all these plans, all these wonderful things she wanted to do, all laid out step by step. I don‚Äôt know what was preventing her from doing them before, but it made me smile hearing how excited she was about them. Something about the conviction in her voice made me truly believe she could do it all.

¬†

Then she asked me about my plans. I froze up a bit. I didn‚Äôt have plans. I wish I did, I was envious of people who did, but I could never seem to figure it out. At some point I think I shut that part of me off entirely.

¬†

‚ÄúThis was as far as I got‚Äù is what I told her. We sat in silence for a bit after that.

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still time.‚Äù she said softly, breaking the silence. I could feel in her voice a new level of comfort and safety. All guards were down on both sides. She knew what I needed to hear, and I knew somehow that those words meant more coming from her than they would anyone else. We simply got each other. In that moment, there was no wall.

¬†

Eventually we said goodnight, and agreed to put the panels up tomorrow. Those soft, comforting words rattled around in my brain all night long. They never really left.

¬†

I woke up early the next day, and I began putting them up before work. It was a bit sad at first, but it‚Äôs not like she was gone or anything. She was still right next door. We could just be friends normally now. I went to work excited about the idea.

¬†

On my way home, I decided that I would properly introduce myself face to face. Just to say hi. I felt confident enough in doing so by this point of knowing her. I got up to the door of 402, and after a brief hesitation, I did the two knocks.

¬†

About two minutes passed and there was no answer. I tried again. Still nothing. I was disappointed but not dejected. She must not be around. I‚Äôll try again tomorrow, I thought.

¬†

When I got inside, I was immediately struck by how much quieter it was. All that constant city noise was getting absorbed by the panels. I didn‚Äôt even think about that. I wasn‚Äôt used to this kind of quiet. Now every small sound was large. I felt vulnerable. Like all the noise was a big comfy blanket I could hide under and now I‚Äôm exposed like a nerve. It would take some getting used to.

¬†

An hour passed in this utter dreary silence. I tried to brave it without distraction to try and acclimate as quickly as possible, but it was just too freaky, so I had to put on some music.

¬†

Not five seconds into the song, I heard ‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù coming from the wall. It was her.

¬†

‚ÄúJane? You can still hear me??‚Äù I almost shouted in disbelief.

¬†

‚ÄúDid you put your things up?‚Äù She responded; her voice was exactly as clear as before.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah! Did you?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI covered the whole wall!‚Äù She shouted.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I was feeling mixed emotions. On one hand, it was nice to talk to her again. On the other hand‚Ä¶ What the hell?

¬†

We were both utterly stumped by this. Neither of us could come up with an explanation or a solution. She offered to try and ask the super to come do something. I told her she could TRY.

¬†

Eventually we settled back down and accepted the situation.

¬†

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ Shit, I guess you‚Äôre here to stay.‚Äù She said.

¬†

‚ÄúI guess I am.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was happy about this or annoyed. I couldn‚Äôt quite tell if I was either.

¬†

‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ I hope you like ABBA then.‚Äù

¬†

I hated ABBA. This was a nightmare.

¬†

We resumed our routine from the days before. It remained mildly inconvenient, while also being oddly comforting. That night we talked more, sat in the same spots on the floor as the night before. I don‚Äôt know why we chose to sit on the floor when both of our beds were right there, but it felt right. The discoloration of the new patch of paint on the wall marked the talking spot perfectly, and it felt a bit nostalgic. It‚Äôs not often you sit on the floor as an adult.

¬†

With all the excess noise being drowned out, it felt like she was even closer. I could literally hear her breathing. We talked a little bit about our upbringings, and we aren‚Äôt terribly different. Her dad sucked, my dad died. We all got fucked up somehow. The good news is, she informed me that I don‚Äôt snore loudly at night which is a huge relief.

¬†

I laid up in bed, after she had said goodnight. I still hadn‚Äôt acclimated to the silence, and now I had to bear it if I wanted to sleep. It wasn‚Äôt working. I was just awake with my thoughts, which is a place I usually hate being, but not so much tonight.

¬†

I thought about Jane, and I thought about the weirdness of this situation. As odd as it all was, it was at least interesting. By far the most interesting thing to happen to me since I moved here. I began having those middle of the night urges to google the principles of sound waves and how they travel. Or how often apartments are vacant for long periods of time. But I resisted, determined that if I laid here unmoving in the dark long enough, sleep would happen.

¬†

Briefly piercing the silence, I heard a mattress creak a few times and blankets shift. It sounded like she rolled over. Then back to nothing.

¬†

I checked the clock. 2 am. Maybe sleep was hopeless. I stared into the dark of my apartment so long I started seeing abstract shapes and folds fade in and out of the shadows and the walls seemed to wobble, as they are want to do. I was so tired.

¬†

I began to fade but then another mattress creak brought me back to lucidity. This one was different. It was a deeper creak, and singular, like one fluid motion. She sat up.

¬†

Without question, that was the sound... But that was the only sound. No creaks, no fidgeting, no swiping sounds of blankets moving while she slowly awoke. It was strange and abrupt. It could be that she had a nightmare, but there was no heavy breathing or gasping or any of that.

¬†

I waited to hear another sound, but it didn‚Äôt come. A half hour passed. I didn‚Äôt hear her get out of bed, I didn‚Äôt hear her lay back down. Was she just‚Ä¶ sitting? My mind began to paint of picture of a woman sitting still in bed in the pitch black darkness and it unnerved me.

¬†

Maybe she did lay back down, just slowly and softly enough that I didn‚Äôt hear it, I thought. Maybe she had her book or something - she said she was reading the other day. Maybe she never sat up at all, and I mistook that sound for something else.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt hear anything else that night, and about an hour later I managed to get some sleep.

¬†

I wondered if I could bring this up to her. Would it be weird? Eventually I decided against it. I don‚Äôt want her thinking about me listening to her sleep. The situation is already a bit uncomfortable as it is when it comes to privacy. Plus, it was probably nothing.

¬†

The next night I got home and double knocked on the wall. She double knocked back. This was our new normal.

¬†

‚ÄúHey, never date a tennis player. You know why?‚Äù She said.

¬†

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs that?‚Äù I responded through my grin as I dealt with the water bucket once again.

¬†

‚ÄúLove means nothing to them.‚Äù She made sure to sound extra dramatic.

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ‚Äì wow. That‚Äôs tremendous.‚Äù I responded, bemused.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna hit you with one of those every day, I decided.‚Äù She said emphatically.

¬†

‚ÄúOh god.‚Äù I pretended to sound annoyed.

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. This is why I don‚Äôt have a boyfriend. They all run away. But you can‚Äôt run away.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI can move away.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôre broke as shit just like me. If you could have, you would have by now.‚Äù She had a point.

¬†

‚ÄúSo deal with it. Here: what do you call a beehive with no exit?‚Äù She continued.

¬†

‚ÄúNo. No more. This is harassment. I weep for your future husband... When you bring a man over, I‚Äôm going to shout at him to run as fast as he can. I will just scream bloody murder until he leaves.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúUn-BEE-LEAVE-able.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúGod damn it. I like that one.‚Äù I replied, I couldn‚Äôt lie.

¬†

‚ÄúAlso I‚Äôm never bringing a man over here, are you kidding? You hear enough as it is.‚Äù Again, she had a point.

¬†

We went about our business, and later that night we talked a bit more. These floor chats before bed we‚Äôd started having had become a highlight of my day and I began looking forward to them while I was at work.

¬†

A part of my brain was trying to recontextualize this into a romantic thing, but it really wasn‚Äôt that, and I didn‚Äôt want it to be. At least not right now. It was just‚Ä¶ nice. It was nice having someone to talk to, who was easy to talk to, who made me laugh, and who I felt comfortable with. It was nice to feel genuinely connected to somebody after feeling disconnected for so long. It was nice to have a friend.

¬†

‚ÄúCan I ask you something?‚Äù I inquired.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù She answered without hesitation.

¬†

‚ÄúWhy did you trust me, so early on?‚Äù I had this question for a while but I felt comfortable enough now to ask.

¬†

Jane paused for a moment before responding, ‚ÄúWhat makes you think I trusted you?‚Äù

¬†

I was a bit taken aback by her question. ‚ÄúOh. Well, you were just so friendly and‚Ä¶ open. I was just wondering‚Ä¶ This is a seedy place and you don‚Äôt know me‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†

She cut me off ‚ÄúI was friendly, yeah, but that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs how you have to be. That‚Äôs like ‚Äòcustomer service voice‚Äô. I don‚Äôt want to anger the strange man living next to me, you know?‚Äù

¬†

That made a lot of sense, I didn‚Äôt think of it that way.

¬†

She continued, ‚ÄúBut I trust you now.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah. I think you‚Äôre a good guy. I think you probably won‚Äôt kill me‚Ä¶ What about me, do you trust me?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still not 100% convinced you exist to be honest. I‚Äôve still never seen you. You didn‚Äôt answer your door when I tried to say hi so‚Ä¶ You might just be a figment of my imagination. Who‚Äôs to say?‚Äù I joked, but a part of me thought that would actually explain things.

¬†

‚ÄúWait when was this?‚Äù She sounded surprised.

¬†

‚ÄúOh, after we put up the sound proofing. I was gonna say hi when I got home from work, but you didn‚Äôt answer.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúReally? Damn. I didn‚Äôt hear you.‚Äù She responded, sounding legitimately disappointed.

¬†

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs a first.‚Äù I joked.

¬†

Jane chuckled, ‚ÄúI know, right?‚Äù

¬†

I sighed, ‚ÄúAlright I gotta try to get some sleep tonight. Last night was fucking awful.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah? I slept like a baby last night, these soundproofing things rule.‚Äù

¬†

‚Ä¶She slept like a baby? The image in my head of her sitting up in her bed replayed and gave me chills once again. Clearly, I must be mistaken. I shook off the thought.

¬†

‚ÄúWell I still need to get used to it‚Ä¶ Goodnight Jane.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHear you later, Leigh.‚Äù That corny son of a bitch. She was serious about doing those jokes every day, wasn‚Äôt she?

¬†

I heard her get up and make her way to bed. A few minutes later and her side fell quiet. I crawled into my bed and I once again stared into the dark. Sleep still wasn‚Äôt coming easy. I dreaded this, but this time it only took about an hour to fall asleep, of which I was grateful. The silence still unsettled me.

¬†

Suddenly I awoke, still in the darkness ‚Äì even deeper now. I don‚Äôt know what woke me up, but when I checked the clock, it was 2 am. I wasn‚Äôt happy. I tried to fall back to sleep, and it was slowly working until‚Ä¶ I heard it again. That same deep bed creak. That unmistakeable sound of someone sitting up. Now I was fully awake.

¬†

Minutes past and I heard nothing else. Same as before. Like she was just‚Ä¶ sitting there. This time however, I just had to know. I was confused, concerned, and pretty creeped out. So I just leaned close to the wall and whispered:

¬†

‚ÄúJane?‚Äù

¬†

Nothing happened at first. But then I heard the bed very slowly begin to creak again. Agonizingly slow and subtle. It sounded like she was‚Ä¶ turning. Or at least adjusting her position in some way. I heard what sounded like her hands touching the wall, splayed out far apart on either side of me and then‚Ä¶ I heard her breathing.

¬†

I could only hear her breathe before when we were sitting back-to-back against the wall, so she must have been pressed right up against it. Her breathing sounded different this time, though. It sounded hollow, like she had a cold. I was petrified. The hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. What was she doing? Was she even awake? What must she look like right now?

¬†

I just stared at the wall. Imagining her on the other side, pressed up against it like some feral thing. Was this really happening? Am I just too tired and loopy to be able to tell? Maybe the creaking was her laying back down and she‚Äôs just breathing heavier than normal because she‚Äôs asleep. I wanted to rationalize this so badly.

¬†

I waited for something else to happen, some other sound‚Ä¶ I waited hours‚Ä¶ But nothing did, and I was too scared to say anything else. Was she still there? Was she pressed against the wall all night long? I tried to get a little bit of sleep. I managed maybe 45 minutes but it was not pleasant.

¬†

I couldn‚Äôt focus on work the next day. I was tired, and I was so creeped out by what happened. I couldn‚Äôt think of an explanation. But I knew there had to be one. There had to be something. I couldn‚Äôt get the image out of my head, and every time that image replayed, she looked a little bit less human. I pictured her smiling a grotesque toothy grin. I imagined her drooling, her eyes open as wide as saucers, her fingers long and bony caressing the wall. None of this was rooted in reality, I knew that, but I couldn‚Äôt help but think of it.

¬†

I got back home and this time I hesitated before doing my customary knocks on the wall, but I did, and she returned them - same as always.

¬†

‚ÄúI was just thinking‚Ä¶ Mankind has made a lot of great inventions.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúJane...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBut the dry-erase board has to be the most remarkable.‚Äù

¬†

I laughed. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to be able to laugh at her jokes today, but I did. She‚Äôs still Jane. At least she seems to be. I was way overthinking.

¬†

‚ÄúThat one‚Äôs pretty good, I can‚Äôt lie.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou like it?‚Äù She asked, sounding proud of herself.

¬†

‚ÄúI do... Hey I have to ask you something though.‚Äù I said, trying to remain at least somewhat casual.

¬†

‚ÄúShoot.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ Sleepwalk?‚Äù

¬†

The other side went silent for a minute. ‚ÄúUm. No‚Ä¶ Never in my life.‚Äù She responded, instantly sounding unnerved.

¬†

I fell silent too‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know how to explain. But she continued.

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a scary ass question to ask out of nowhere. Did you hear something?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI heard‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know exactly what I heard.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúStop. Don‚Äôt talk like that. Is this revenge for the corny jokes? I‚Äôll stop the corny jokes. Don‚Äôt do this to me.‚Äù She pleaded in a half-joking manner.

¬†

‚ÄúNo, I promise I‚Äôm not messing with you - and it‚Äôs probably nothing. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ You didn‚Äôt get up at all last night? Or the night before?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo, I did not get up at all. Please tell me what you heard.‚Äù She said firmly.

¬†

I told Jane everything that happened. I tried to be delicate, but also honest. I trusted that she didn‚Äôt know what was going on. That became evident to me by how freaked out she seemed. I know it sounded crazy, I just hope she didn‚Äôt think I was messing with her. It was difficult to tell from her tone.

¬†

Initially she wanted to debunk it all, saying that I must have heard something else ‚Äì which I admitted could very well be true. Nevertheless, she told me she was going to stay with her sister for the night. Probably a good idea. She gave me her phone number and told me to call if anything happened. That put my mind at ease about whether or not she trusted me.

¬†

I told her to be safe, and she tried once again to reassure me that it was probably nothing, but I felt a sense of immense dread as soon as she left. Suddenly I really didn‚Äôt want to be alone here.

¬†

That night was the quietest of my life, and not in a good way. I thought about drowning it out by putting on some music or a movie, but nothing felt right.

¬†

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd be able to sleep that night, but eventually I managed. I ended up having a dream about a woman wearing a veil. through the veil I could vaguely make out three large black holes where her eyes and mouth should be. I couldn‚Äôt recall anything that happened in the dream‚Ä¶ Only the image of that woman. I wondered if that was my subconscious way of trying to visualize Jane. I still didn‚Äôt know what she actually looked like so maybe my brain had trouble coming up with distinct features for her. Or maybe it was something else entirely.

¬†

It was still dark when I awoke from the dream. I felt a deep unease as I checked the time. 2 am, again. This time I wasn‚Äôt eager to fall back to sleep. I didn‚Äôt want to see the veiled woman again, so I stayed up a little while longer, attempting to ease my mind. I thought of every possible way to reassure myself. Eventually I began to fall into a fa√ßade of comfort, until‚Ä¶

¬†

Creak.

¬†

I went ice cold. No. This can‚Äôt be. I didn‚Äôt just hear that.

¬†

It was that same ‚Äúsitting up‚Äù creak. But I heard Jane leave. Could she have come back late while I was sleeping? Maybe. But what if it isn‚Äôt her?

¬†

What if it was never her?

¬†

My mind raced. So many improbable scenarios played out in my mind. None of them were good. Was someone else in there with her the whole time and she didn‚Äôt know? Someone hiding away, only coming out when she‚Äôs sleeping? Was that creak her sitting up, or someone else sitting down? Do they watch her sleep?

¬†

All I knew for sure was that someone was on the other side of this wall. Because I could hear them breathing again.

¬†

I wanted to do something. I wanted to know for sure. But I was powerless. Calling out to it last time was the most horrific mistake of my life, I didn‚Äôt want to try that again. I wanted to call Jane but I was afraid of making a sound. Instead I just waited, and listened.

¬†

I was in a petrified daze. Hyperalert but also completely exhausted. My body wanted to shut down but my brain wouldn‚Äôt let me. It may have been minutes, or it may have been hours, I couldn‚Äôt tell. The image of the veiled woman kept reappearing in the back of my subconscious.

¬†

Eventually I decided to call Jane. If I heard a phone ring on the other side, then I would know. I typed the number in and hit call‚Ä¶

¬†

‚ÄúThe number you are trying to reach is not in service.‚Äù What? How could that be?

¬†

Suddenly, cutting through the silence was a sound I had become very familiar with, and yet was the one sound I was the least prepared for.

¬†

Knock Knock.

¬†

1ge54c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mystery/comments/1ge54c3/my_dead_husband_came_to_give_me_a_heartfelt/,My dead husband came to give me a heartfelt goodbye. I loved you and will love you,"My husband died of a heart attack on February 2, 2015; he was 60 years old. That morning, he drove our youngest daughter, who was 16, to the bus stop because it was dark and raining outside. When he came home, we sat and had a cup of coffee together. At 7 a.m., he went into our bedroom to shower and get ready for work. I told him I'd give him half an hour before I would come in to take my shower.

When I did, I found him dead on the bathroom floor. His skin was grey, his eyes open, his glasses on, and his body twisted as if he had collapsed. I tried to get a response, then started chest compressions. Nothing. I called for my dad, who was in the kitchen, to call 911. When help arrived, it was a police officer, then later EMTs.

The officer tried to give him a shock with those paddles, but it wouldn't go off at all to provide the shock; he was gone, unresponsive. The EMTs couldn't get his heart started either. He was dead. I was in shock. We had been together for 22 years and married for 17.5 years. He was the love of my life, my soulmate. The doctor at the hospital said he died instantly; he wouldn't have known what was happening, and he didn‚Äôt feel any pain.

A week after his passing, a female friend of mine was helping me go through my husband's things in our bedroom. I was standing by his side of the bed, gathering up papers and mail from his nightstand. I turned and looked up toward the hallway that was between the bathroom and a little dressing room where our closets were. I saw a dark shadow step out of the bathroom into the hallway and turn toward me, about 15 feet away.

As I stared at it, I said to my friend, ‚ÄúThere's a shadow.‚Äù She turned and looked but didn‚Äôt say anything. Then I said, ‚ÄúHoney, you died. Go to the light. You don't belong here anymore. Go see your father.‚Äù The shadow vanished.

I miss my husband so much; he was a wonderful husband and father. I pray he is at peace in heaven. In the days that followed, I felt lost, wandering through the house that once echoed with laughter and warmth. Every corner reminded me of him. The smell of his cologne hung in our bedroom, a bittersweet reminder of the man I had loved for so long. I would often sit on the bed, staring at his side, waiting for him to walk in and share a joke or simply ask how my day had been.

The initial shock slowly turned into a deep sense of loneliness. Although friends and family surrounded me with their condolences, nothing could replace the gap he left behind. It was during those quiet evenings, sitting alone with my thoughts, that his absence truly hit me. I recalled our late-night talks, how we would plan our weekends, and how he always knew how to make me laugh, even on my toughest days.

As¬†the¬†days¬†passed,¬†I started to¬†really¬†feel¬†how¬†much¬†I¬†missed¬†him. I¬†looked¬†for¬†little¬†hints¬†that he was¬†still¬†around,¬†like¬†when¬†a¬†light¬†blinked,¬†the¬†floor¬†made¬†a¬†noise,¬†or I¬†felt¬†a¬†soft¬†breeze on his side of the bed. I even began to talk to him,¬†telling¬†him¬†about¬†my day,¬†what¬†was¬†bothering¬†me,¬†and¬†what¬†I¬†dreamed¬†about¬†for the future. It¬†made¬†me¬†feel¬†better¬†to¬†think¬†that he¬†could¬†hear¬†me and was¬†helping¬†me in¬†some¬†way,¬†even¬†if¬†he¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†here¬†anymore.

One evening, I decided to¬†look¬†through¬†some¬†of his¬†things.¬†It was¬†hard¬†to¬†do,¬†but I¬†needed¬†to.¬†When I opened his drawers, I found an old photo album.¬†As¬†I¬†turned¬†the pages, I¬†saw¬†pictures¬†of¬†us¬†together‚Äîour¬†wedding,¬†family¬†trips,¬†and¬†funny¬†moments that¬†showed¬†how¬†much¬†we¬†loved¬†each¬†other.¬†Each¬†photo¬†made¬†me¬†feel¬†happy¬†and¬†reminded¬†me¬†of the¬†good¬†times¬†we¬†shared.¬†It was¬†like¬†I could almost hear¬†him¬†laughing¬†in those¬†special¬†moments.

I realized how much he had shaped me. He had been my rock, always encouraging me to pursue my passions and dreams. He would often say, ""Life is too short not to enjoy it,"" and I knew I needed to honor that sentiment. In the weeks that followed, I began to explore activities that I had put on hold for years‚Äîpainting, gardening, and even writing. Each brush stroke and every flower I planted felt like a tribute to him, a way of keeping his spirit alive in my heart, which would always be.

One night, while lying in bed, I had a vivid dream. In it, my husband appeared, bathed in a soft, warm light. He looked as he did in his younger days, full of life and vitality. We spoke briefly, and he told me he was okay, that I needed to take care of myself, and that he would always be with me. I woke up feeling a sense of peace I hadn‚Äôt felt since he passed. It was as if he had wrapped me in a comforting embrace from the other side, assuring me that I wasn't alone.

As the months came by, I started attending a support group for those who had lost loved ones. Sharing my story with others who understood my pain was cathartic. We laughed and cried together, finding solace in our shared experiences. The group became a safe space, allowing me to voice my fears and hopes without judgment. I learned that grief had no timeline and that it was okay to feel joy again while still missing him.

One of the group members suggested writing letters to our loved ones as a way to process our feelings. I found this exercise to be incredibly therapeutic. Each week, I would pour my heart onto the page, telling him about my day, sharing my struggles, and letting him know how much I missed him. It felt like a way to keep our connection alive, and I cherished the moments I spent writing to him.

Eventually, I started to feel a sense of renewal. I realized that while my husband may no longer be physically present, his love continued to guide me. I decided to take a trip to one of our favorite places‚Äî the beach where we had spent many summers together. It was a place filled with laughter, joy, and beautiful memories. As I walked along the shore, the salty breeze whipped through my hair, and I could almost hear his voice mingling with the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.

Sitting on the sand, I closed my eyes and imagined him beside me, his hand holding mine. I let the waves wash over my feet, feeling the warmth of the sun on my skin, and I whispered, ‚ÄúI love you, and I always will.‚Äù In that moment, I understood that love transcends even death, and the memories we create together remain etched in our hearts forever.

As I began to move forward, I embraced life with a newfound perspective. I started volunteering at a local shelter, channeling my energy into helping others in need. It was rewarding and fulfilling, allowing me to honor my husband‚Äôs memory by spreading kindness and love. Every time I helped someone, I felt as if he were smiling down on me, proud of the person I was becoming.

It‚Äôs been several years since I lost him, and while the pain of his absence still lingers, I have learned to cherish the moments we shared rather than dwell on the loss. I carry him with me in everything I do‚Äî in my art, my actions, and my heart. The shadow I saw that day in the hallway reminded me that while he may not be physically here, his spirit continues to guide me.

In remembering him, I‚Äôve learned to celebrate life, to embrace the beautiful messiness of it all, and to cherish the moments that make us feel alive. I often find myself smiling when I think of our life together, knowing that love is eternal and that he will always be a part of me. So, as I navigate this journey, I hold onto the lessons he taught me‚Äî to love fiercely, laugh often, and never take a single moment for granted.

I pray he is at peace in heaven, and I know that one day, we will be reunited. Until then, I carry him with me in my heart, a guiding light through the darkness. And in that way, I will never truly be alone.

I am about to finish up week 5 on Kit 2. Its been going well so far. I am down about 3 pounds from my startweight! The meds have also helped me quit vaping and my coffee addiction which is so exciting. I get at least 30 mins of movement everyday, yoga, pilates or just walking my dog. 

Ive had some side effects, had to take naltrexone in the evening for awhile but pretty manageable, up until last week. I went 5 days without a single poop. This is the most constipated I have ever been in my life. I think its a mixture of the medication, no nicotine and no caffeine in my diet. During those 5 days I tried everything, I take senoknot and magnesium citrate every night anyways, added more senoknot, smooth moove tea, ducolax, miralax, nothing was working. After two days of drinking coffee again and finally espresso ontop of all the laxatives and stool softeners it finally passed.

I am looking to see if anyone else has expeirenced this? What are some suggestions to help this constipation?

My kids and I play with lego and we have fun leaving little dioramas around my house. Just silly stuff like a fight between Ironman and Darth Vader on the loot llama. It's just our way of leaving Easter eggs around the house. 

My nephew really liked them and decided to take a few home. When we noticed they were missing I asked my brother to bring them back. He said that it was just kids being kids and that he would them back the next time we saw each other. 

I saw him for coffee and I reminded him beforehand that I wanted all our stuff back. He ""forgot"" to bring the ""toys"". Okay. Game on. 

We went over to his place for a BBQ. I told my kids that unless all our stuff was returned to us when we got there literally anything in the house was fair game. Like the godless barbarians they are they went to town. When we left I don't think there were any remotes, small electronics, or beer mugs left at his house. I actually  had to sneak the dog back into the house before we left. 

I started getting calls on our way home. I ignored them. 

When I got home I returned his calls. He said a bunch of stuff was missing from his house. I said I would check with the kids. He said that I fucking well knew what happened and that he wanted his shit back. I said I would box it up and return it the next time we saw eack other. As long as we got our lego back. 

He was at my house with my Lego later that evening. He had even accidentally included stuff that wasn't ours. I returned it and his stuff. I told him that this is how we would be dealing with his kid in the future. 

He is pissed off that he had to make a special trip to return my stuff. My parents think that there is a huge difference between an eight year old taking Lego minifigures and a couple of teenagers pillaging their uncle's house.

This is wild, and I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wrong here. A couple of months ago, I (32F) went on a work retreat where I bonded with a coworker, Emily (28F). We don‚Äôt work directly together, but we‚Äôd always gotten along, and this trip made us a lot closer. Toward the end of the retreat, we‚Äôd had a few drinks, and Emily got pretty emotional, telling me about something she referred to as her ‚Äúbiggest secret.‚Äù

Basically, she revealed that she‚Äôs had a child she never told anyone about‚Äînot even her current boyfriend or her close family. She said she‚Äôd given the baby up for adoption years ago and had been struggling with it ever since. I didn‚Äôt pry too much, just listened and supported her. She begged me to never tell anyone, even hinted that she was trusting me because she had no one else she could talk to about it. I agreed to keep it confidential.

Flash forward to last week. Emily and I went out for coffee, and she started talking about how she was thinking of finally telling her boyfriend, but she was terrified of how he‚Äôd react. I told her I thought it was a good idea to be open with him about something so big, especially since they‚Äôve been talking about marriage and kids. She got defensive and said she wasn‚Äôt ready. I didn‚Äôt push, but I said if she felt this guilty, maybe it was time to be honest with him.

Around 8 years ago, I was at the peak of my shape: 68 kg, 13-14% BF, then declined until 81 kg and 24% BF.

Around 2 years ago, I started training again, 2-3 times a week, with EGYM (not by choice, but simply because the only gym that fits into my daily schedule is tiny and uses only this equipment). 

Now I'm 78 kg, 21% body fat. I feel that - considering two years have passed - the progress is negligible. Admittedly, there's been a break of 4 months that reset all my progress, but now I am back on track and I train \~5 times a week.

Nutrition is alright: I counted calories extensively in the past, so I developed some form of intuitive eating. I try to hit 100 gr of protein daily and eat in the range of 2000-2500 kcal. I drink very little water, unfortunately. No alcohol, no smoke, no coffee.

The training itself has never felt really challenging: it's a circuit of 8 machines repeated twice. Rep range is 12-15 per set. The machines are in the following order lat pull down, back extension, chest press, leg raises, abs crunch, leg curl, back row, leg press. Weight is set automatically following a strength test for one rep max.

I feel my body completely adapted to this circuit, I can train 3-4 days in a row, rest 1 day and repeat without feeling sore or with any decline in performance (on the contrary). My strength has been steadily going up, however I don't see visible changes.

Am I wasting my time? Has anyone ever had good results with these machines?

But one thing that really changed the brew for me was: Water.

Initially, I thought people changing to different types of products to be a bit of a placebo at best, delusion at worst. Then people started explaining why water actually matters as having the right amount of mineral ion would help extraction better.

Now I don't live in the States and there is a certain bottled water brand that has become a go-to for coffee brewers. It changed the taste and flavor signature in an instant the way I did not see coming. At this point I was brewing with an imported bean from Prodigal Coffee Roasters, which had a very rich and delicate acidity supported by stronger sweetness.

Initially, the acid would hit me, disappear, and then reappear with strength until the end. Once I changed the water? The 'disappear' part was gone: it was full tour de force from start to finish. Small mistakes I would make from my routine was fully offset because extraction would work no matter what. 

I guess different countries have different brands, but do look for something in between soft water and hard water; don't go full hard water but soft water would also hurt extraction.

1ge4pj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ge4pj2/the_miracle_of_the_burning_crane_part_one/,The Miracle of the Burning Crane (Part One),"*in the divided city of Machiryo Bay, corporate giant Sacred Dynamics begins the controversial decision to replace a centuries-old temple with a new branch office. Two agents attempt to do their jobs. Protests gather around the city.*

**Part One: Of Prophets and Protest**

*Machiryo Bay* is a city that can only be truly united in disdain and division towards its other, our government, and our gods, both old and new. There is no common goal, no common people, no great god of the city to rule them all.¬†

It‚Äôs a city both old and new. Both serene and angry at the same time. It‚Äôs lush, yet ablaze. Machiryo Bay is the largest of the few great hidden cities in our world today- where people genuinely still believe in the strange, the other, the world beyond our own.  
  
It‚Äôs a place built upon great temples old and new, a nexus that overlaps our world and the world beyond. A haven for those who still believe- but yet even in this shared knowledge of the world beyond our own- there is division.  
  
There are the Old Gods of the folk tradition. There are the New Gods of wealth and industry. And there is the governing body of councilors. Everybody hates the government.¬†  
  
A megapolis, hidden through star-sunken sigils, invisible to those who do not believe. A city nearly always in division. A pilgrim‚Äôs final destination.

I love it.

My name is Arbor Moss. I‚Äôve lived here nearly all my life.¬†

The building I work in is perhaps one of the largest buildings in the city. A massive dome stacked on pale, rust-stained modular cubes dotted with large windows so that workers in little office cubes in cubic structures themselves may stare out and gaze at the city below.

A scattering of temples surrounds the building, each small, compact, and angular and minimal as the building itself. Shrines to gods of defense, stability, and construction. New and old gods alike.  
  
A red blinking billboard sits in front of the building. It practically whispers the ad into my mind. It probably does.¬†

‚ÄúCHOOSE SACRED DYNAMICS TODAY!‚Äù The building does not seem welcoming. ‚ÄúTOGETHER WE WILL BRING PROGRESS!‚Äù

I ignored the blinking billboard and made my way to the entrance of my workplace.¬†

I entered the security checkpoint to my division, a little bulbous white temple. ‚ÄúName, and division, please?‚Äù

I scan my ID tag. ‚ÄúArbor Moss,‚Äù I begin, waving to the security guard, ‚ÄúI work in *Acquisition and Domain,* same as always.‚Äù

‚ÄúLooks good. Good to see you as always,‚Äù the security guard, a good friend of mine, replies. ‚ÄúDid you catch the news last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI had an early night.‚Äù

My friend, the security guard (who‚Äôs name I never seemed to remember) shakes her head in disapproval. ‚ÄúWe live in changing times, Arbor,‚Äù she begins, ‚Äúthe political prophets on the news say there‚Äôs going to be mass protests across the city unless we cut back on the New Gods.‚Äù

I shrug. ‚ÄúThis is nothing new. They‚Äôre always saying that.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFeels different, Arbor,‚Äù she murmurs. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs going to happen. The protests gain more followers everyday. We‚Äôre expanding the industry too fast.‚Äù

I shake my head. ‚ÄúWe work for the industry,‚Äù I remind. ‚ÄúSacred Dynamics *is* practically the industry itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, of course,‚Äù she nods, agreeable. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm keeping you, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù I nod, cautiously. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk later.‚Äù

And then I fix myself a coffee in the lounge, take a sandwich and retreat to a cubicle. I file in my reports for the day, do as I‚Äôm told- mostly survey potential sites and manage partial construction funds.¬†

New temples, new factories, new shops.¬†

And then I‚Äôm called to a meeting.

The room is bright and colorful, marked with devotional and inspirational phrases accompanied with murals of workers, myths, legends. It‚Äôs kind of annoying, the corporate art style.

This is a really important meeting. There are two city councilors here.¬†

My boss, a shiny-suited bald man named Doug rolls in, ready to present. ‚ÄúWelcome, welcome!‚Äù he claps, cheerful. Most people work at Sacred Dynamics for the pay. Doug genuinely seems to believe in the corporation and its goals.¬†

His dedication is commendable. Admirable, even. I believe in the industry as much as the next person- but Doug takes it to a whole new level.

More and more people begin to pour into the room. Whatever this meeting‚Äôs about- it was something big.¬†

A political prophet I‚Äôve seen on television, a thin man with a wicked smile whispers something to one of the city councilors, and then to Doug, and finally, to a Sacred Dynamics executive.¬†

¬†My field partner, Maren, is here. I spent the days mostly surveying sites from the comfort of my office. Maren spent hers negotiating with property owners and temple-priests to acquire the property itself.

We switch our roles every few months. Together, we manage the acquisition and desanctification of new land being bought out by the company.¬†

Well paid, but often heartbreaking work. ‚ÄúArbor,‚Äù she greets, sitting beside me. ‚ÄúAre you ready for this?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really, no,‚Äù I confess. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what this meeting is.‚Äù

She tilts her head. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt heard?‚Äù I shake mine, confused. The doors seal themselves shut. The meeting‚Äôs about to begin. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a temple down in the new business sector,‚Äù she continues, ‚Äúthe land was part of the recent business acquisition. We‚Äôre supposed to be building a new general store there.‚Äù

I‚Äôd heard whispers of this. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that old, uh,‚Äù I pause and think, ‚Äústone- or cave god?‚Äù¬†

Maren nods. ‚ÄúOne of those two- they‚Äôve been staging an illegal protest for the past month- we‚Äôre supposed to have built another branch office down there by now. Some of the big boys-‚Äù she gestures to the executive across us, ‚Äúare getting concerned.‚Äù

‚ÄúInteresting.‚Äù

I‚Äôm cut off by Doug before I can say more. ‚ÄúOkay, okay, let‚Äôs have order, people!‚Äù¬†

He smiles, too cheerful for what we know we‚Äôll have to do. ‚ÄúCouncilor Lowe- nice tie,‚Äù he gives him a thumbs up. The councilor doesn‚Äôt seem to care, ‚ÄúBranch Leader Jan- glad to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoug, Doug,‚Äù the executive- Jan remarks, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get on with this. The more we wait the more these protests get out of hand.‚Äù

Doug nods. The lights dim, and the presentation begins. This was going to be a long day.

\-----------------------

**\[Sound of a bustling radio station, with a slight echo of distant protests. A jingle is played.\]**

**Ami Zhou**: ‚ÄúGood morning, Machiryo Bay! This is *Machiryo Morning Media*, and I‚Äôm Ami Zhou, here to cover the shocking events unfolding at the Temple of the Cairn Keeper. Just now, agents of Sacred Dynamics began the controversial process of desanctifying the temple after approval by controversial Councilor Lowe to enact eminent domain to clear the site for a new branch office. Meanwhile, protestors hailing from diverse faiths all over the city have gathered to protest this new controversial act- but one in a series of unrestrained expansionist behavior-

**Lind Quarry**: ‚ÄúWhile I respect your passion, Ami, we must recognize the necessity of progress in our rapidly evolving city. Sacred Dynamics is the number one provider of jobs and economic growth in our city. Sure, these protestors are upset- but really, really- Sacred Dynamics will, in the long run, bring us growth, jobs, and inter-faith appeal.‚Äù

**Ami Zhou**: ‚ÄúBut at what cost, Lind? By bulldozing our sacred sites, we are essentially allowing corporations to rewrite our history! The followers of the Cairn Keeper are peacefully protesting, defending their right to worship. And let's not forget the potential hazards of relocating artifacts.‚Äù

**Lind Quarry**: ‚ÄúBut is the history of the Cairn Keeper something we *want* to uphold? As I recall- the Keeper‚Äôs people are some of the most backwards, ritual-sacrificing folks out there. Barely anyone follows this podunk god of what- stone?‚Äù

**Ami Zhou**: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about that- this faith is one of the oldest in our city. If it‚Äôs allowed to be bulldozed over like it means *nothing,* who‚Äôs to stop Councilor Lowe- who‚Äôs shown unwavering support for this eminent domain from rewriting our cultural legacy! What human sacrifice there is- is limited, and they follow the government quota! Listeners- your faith could be next.‚Äù¬†

**Lind Quarry:** ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous. Our city prides itself not only in industry- but the heritage of our people. These slippery slope arguments are foolish- and to really move on to better, progressive times- we need to let go of these old, blood-ritual faiths.‚Äù

**Ami Zhou:** ‚ÄúAt any rate, we‚Äôll be keeping a close eye on the desanctification today.‚Äù

**Lind Quarry:** ‚ÄúNext up- we‚Äôll be discussing a brand new faith- should your morning dose of coffee be sacred?‚Äù

\-------------------------------------

Neither Doug nor the ensemble of executives and politicians follow us outside and into a small car with the logo of red, bleeding ‚ÄúSACRED DYNAMICS‚Äù engraved onto its side. This sort of work is too dirty for them.

The protests have already rocked the city for some time. Upper management had already issued a series of warnings- today was the day the temple was to be desanctified and the demolition was to begin.

The protestors were loud. They‚Äôd brought megaphones and sound-sigils, trying their best to match the sound of construction equipment moving in, ready to demolish the temple.

The car stops. People began to surround our car, slamming against the windows. People with microphones and cameras. ‚ÄúI hate goddamn press,‚Äù Maren snapped. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not letting us past them.‚Äù

They tapped and continued to ask questions. Loaded questions. ‚ÄúMaybe if we answer some they‚Äôll go away?‚Äù I knew it was wistful.

‚ÄúThey told us to let Doug handle the press conferences,‚Äù Maren touted.  
  
‚ÄúDoug is also the company lapdog,‚Äù I pointed out. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt relate to the people- he‚Äôll be happy to turn over one question to us.‚Äù  
  
Maren nodded and rolled down a window. ‚ÄúYou guys get one question!‚Äù  
  
A cacophony of voices. I picked out a young reporter, quiet.¬†  
  
He seemed very happy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from the \*Daily Eyeless Scribe-\* how does Sacred Dynamics plan to address the cultural impact of moving the temple‚Äôs artifacts elsewhere- and what‚Äôs stopping this from becoming part of the growing precedent of the New Industry Gods rewriting local and old folk history?‚Äù  
  
I take his question calmly. ‚ÄúListen- we‚Äôre all trying to make a living. And the fundamental truth of the matter is that we have more and more pilgrims coming into this city every day.‚Äù I also avoid the first question. The brief had told us not to pick up on that, let the government handle it.¬†

I continue. ‚ÄúAnd these people- well, they bring growth and new faith into our communities. New ones, old ones- but you can‚Äôt live with just faith. We‚Äôre in goddamn America- so we have to make concessions. And the fact of the matter is that the Cairn Keeper still demands blood sacrifice- and a new branch office is opening up hundreds of new jobs.‚Äù

I feel quite proud of that remark. I‚Äôd taken a corporate interest seminar over some office retreat a few months back.

The young reporter stares at me. ‚ÄúBut do the New Industry Gods not demand another kind of sacrifice- the sacrifice of our youth, our time, our-‚Äù

Maren rolls the window before I answer. ‚ÄúWatch those sigils,‚Äù she murmurs. ‚ÄúMakes you want to answer. Devious things.‚Äù

The car begins to roll forward, satisfied. But Maren is right. I answer too easily. The protestors chant around us. Security guards with the logo of our company part the crowd and allow us onto the site.

The temple is old. I‚Äôd read up on the history on the ride to the site. The religion had been one of the oldest in the foundation of the city- literally.

‚ÄúDid you know,‚Äù I mused, ‚Äúthat when the founders were building Machiryo- the followers of the Cairn Keeper would sacrifice people by burying them alive?‚Äù

Maren nodded. ‚ÄúThe blessings of stronger foundations. And now we have concrete. And laws against unruly blood sacrifice.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù I murmur. ‚ÄúI understand where the protestors out there come from- but really? The Cairn Keeper?‚Äù I shake my head. ‚ÄúSome of these faiths are too backwards for our time.‚Äù

Maren laughs and we settle ourselves on a bench, awaiting a priest to meet us. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre starting to sound like Councilor Lowe.‚Äù

I imitate the Councilor, making my voice deeper, round. I quote one of his all-too recycled lines. ‚ÄúI understand, Maren, that calm is essential. But calm will only happen when people feel safe and secure, and that won‚Äôt come from rituals that belong to a bygone era.‚Äù

I break, giggling like a small child. Maren joins in- and we stop when a man dressed in the red engraving of Sacred Dynamics‚Äô homegrown god of industry steps up.

‚ÄúHello, um,‚Äù he begins, awkwardly. He ruffles short, spiked hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Prior Twain. You‚Äôre the claim experts?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Maren confirms, displaying a badge. ‚ÄúBrief us on the situation. Anything violent or cursed we‚Äôll handle.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, right,‚Äù Twain continues. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been at a siege with these, um,‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt seem to want to say the name of the temple, their god, ‚Äúpeople. Right- for about a month now, since we arrived to start desanctification.‚Äù

I looked up at the temple. Periodically, agents of the company carved sigils and signs into the dirt, into parchment. Bolts of energy leapt from them at the temple itself- but fizzled at an invisible wall. ‚ÄúAs you can see, they‚Äôve got some very effective shield-signs.‚Äù

Maren inspects the markings on the priests‚Äô robes. The language of the signs are familiar, one of the old, powerful folk gods. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on contract from the Weather God‚Äôs people.‚Äù

Twain nods to this. ‚ÄúWe just can‚Äôt seem to break the shielding- we‚Äôve caught sabotage from some unruly protestors, and um,‚Äù he pauses, staring back at the row of monks praying, keeping up the shielding, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs also the sheer strength of that.‚Äù

I nod and jot down some notes. This could be handled. Probably. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre specialists,‚Äù I assure. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve studied protection marks.‚Äù

Maren places a hand on the young priest assuredly. ‚ÄúOnce we break the shielding- I need your people to be ready- we need to secure and destroy the artifacts that keep the temple sacred.‚Äù

Twain takes a step back, clearly uncomfortable. ‚ÄúI was under the impression we were relocating the artifacts and the faith elsewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh we are- in a way,‚Äù I explain. ‚ÄúIs this your first time with SD?‚Äù he nods, shyly. ‚ÄúSee those vans-‚Äù I point to a series of black vans, eerie and marked to to the brim with containment signs, ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt tell you this, but when the artifacts go in there- they get scanned and destroyed instantly.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Twain murmurs. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Ä¶‚Äù

Maren cuts him off. ‚ÄúWe have replicas built by a team of expert shape magicians from the debris. No need to worry.‚Äù She looks off, expectantly, worried at the protest, then at the temple. ‚ÄúLook, kid- this is government approved. So we need to know if you can be ready.‚Äù

Twain nods. We‚Äôre ready. ‚ÄúMe and Maren will cast the sign- then we‚Äôll move to harvest and seize. Any temple guardians or devils or whatever- me and Maren will deal with.‚Äù

‚ÄúClear?‚Äù Maren adds. Twain nods.

And then we‚Äôre at the perimeter, right at the great shield wall separating the civilized world, the forces of industry, against a backwards faith keeping destabilizing the people.

The protest is loud even here. They scream slogans and chants. ‚ÄúMachiryo is more than metal!‚Äù they shout, ‚ÄúStop the New Gods!‚Äù

Maren makes a snide remark towards them. I ignore her. I give the monk across the barrier to surrender peacefully, as is customary. He declines our offer. I sigh in defiant annoyance.

Me and Maren sit down, crosslegged. We establish a circle of powdered basil around us. A triquetra within the circle, and then the mark of a closed eye. Then a Sacred Dynamics patented artifact, a small device between us, in the center eye of the sigil.

The god we are attempting to use has no name. It is an infant, blindfolded and trimmed by the research and design division of our company. It‚Äôs an experimental god. It has no licensed, truthful name. It‚Äôs new, pulled from the space between.

It doesn‚Äôt stop anyone from giving it names. ‚ÄòThe Hollow Between‚Äô is pretty common, as is the ‚ÄòSilence Amidst Stars‚Äô.

I set off the company's patented device. The experimental god is summoned, it‚Äôs will and spirit focused through the device. Everything goes quiet, and the barrier shatters, soundlessly- and a burning rainbow of pure Cairn Keeper energy is funneled into the device.

The monk across from me opens his eyes, stopping mid prayer- and shouts- ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre through the shield- set off the second one-‚Äù

But he doesn‚Äôt get to set off the second row of prayers and signs, because Maren lunges at him, throwing her entire weight and pinning him to the ground.¬†

I turn back- Twain and the other domain agents are descended like ravenous vultures upon the temple. The monks retreat or clash with them, fighting hand to hand, eye to eye, one spell after another.

I see central security division agents emerge- experimental god-devices are set off. Behind me, the protest grows louder, straining against the barrier the company has prayed upon.

A rock manages to slip through, landing near me. I stare back and shake my head. I turn and march upon the temple, aiding Maren in the arrest of the monk.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to move in,‚Äù I decide. ‚ÄúI can sense something within the temple- something strong.‚Äù

‚ÄúA temple guardian- I feel it too,‚Äù Maren agrees. She sets the struggling monk loose- right into the hands of several domain agents, and he‚Äôs escorted to a holding cell attached to a truck.¬†

I reach into the beyond, the *ether* and feel for the temple‚Äôs sacred spaces. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a large temple- most of it underground. We‚Äôll need to desanctify the main shrine on the lowest level to deal with this as efficiently as possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù The monks were putting up a fight, and behind us- the protests had broken through the first barrier, and our people was divided, riot police aiding the management of the angry crowd. ‚ÄúRemember the desanctification of the Father Below?‚Äù

I nod, remembering. ‚ÄúNo shrine- no prayers- let‚Äôs go!‚Äù I hand pick two security agents to escort us through the battle- and we run into the temple while divine smokescreens are cast around us.

We enter. We‚Äôre ready.

\------------------------------------------------------------

**\[Background sound of protest. The sound of police drones and summoned familiars\]**

\*\*Ami Zhou: ‚Äú\*\*Welcome back to Machiryo Morning Media! It‚Äôs past midday and the controversial desanctification of the Cairn Keeper‚Äôs temple is underway. Protestors have gathered in full force and with Sacred Dynamics pushing forward, the government has turned to renowned political prophet Keith Smilings to assure the public this is a positive step towards our city and to refrain from protesting. It‚Äôs no secret political prophets have been recruited to sway public opinion before and this prophet‚Äôs predictions certainly seem very well timed- Lind?‚Äù

\*\*Lind Quarry: ‚Äú\*\*Ami- I think we all have to remind ourselves that we live in very divisive, troubled times. But that we can get together as a city despite our differing opinions- like us! The role of a political prophet, as always, is impartial and to help lead our people- and the government in times of turmoil. Their purpose is clarity-not chaos. The government bringing in Prophet Smilings is a responsible decision.‚Äù

\*\*Ami Zhou: ‚Äú\*\*Let‚Äôs hear directly from a clip from Prophet Smiling‚Äôs earlier press conference on the matter.‚Äù

**\[News Clip- people bustling, asking questions\]**

\*\*Keith Smilings: ‚Äú\*\*My fellow Bay Citizens. Machiryo Bay needs a new way forward- this has been revealed to me but the gods of peace and prosperity. We need to bring about this stable vision granted to me by our Peace-Loving-Mother-Above, this vision of unity, of economic growth, of stability. She tells us to move forward from a time of idolatry and holding on to old, irrelevant gods and sacred artifacts. We as a people- must see reason. This is my prophecy: we must continue to remove old gods of blood and ritual sacrifice to a new age of reason, of enlightenment.‚Äù

**Ami Zhou:** ‚ÄúReason? Or a corporate sponsored prophecy? It‚Äôs no secret this prophet was clearly brought in on Sacred Dynamic‚Äôs dime- is this not rubber stamping the destruction of our cities faiths in the name of progress?‚Äù

**Lind Quarry:** ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous- folks, this isn‚Äôt some state sponsored purge of your religious freedom. This is a lawful act designed to allow new jobs and growth within our city.‚Äù

**Ami Zhou:** ‚ÄúLind, if this is a truly lawful act- why are police forces and SD‚Äôs private military clashing with both temple monks and protestors as we speak? This goes beyond lawful- people are already calling this a sham prophecy- a validation by force.‚Äù

**Lind Quarry:** Or is this just common sense? Sometimes we just need a push forward into the light- and Prophet Smilings‚Äô endorsement is just a beacon of light dragging us from our past.¬†

**Ami Zhou:** ‚ÄúThen this light is blinding. At any rate- we‚Äôre keeping our eyes as the desanctification continues. Next we‚Äôll be speaking with Councilor Harrow on maintaining balance in a polarized society.‚Äù

# Welcome to your new Mod Free Origins SMP

We are are a Minecraft SMP Origins Server for 1.20-1.21 with custom tailored plugins that promotes a crossplay experience for both java and bedrock players without the need to install any mods. With heavy inspiration from the original Origins mod, we are inspired from the original mod  with additional new twist for the origins such as a Blazeborn's new heat gauge mechanic or Shulk capability to levitate enemies on hit.

We promote a friendly nontoxic environment and focus development to promote player to player interactions to create memorable experiences. We do not allow griefing, stealing, or harassment. We do offer a supporter rank for those wanting to show appreciation but only provide small QOL changes to avoid P2W advantages and to keep the server fair to all.

# Why Play Origins Reborn?

*Processing img w804v9xwyarc1...*

We offer a unique Towny experience via custom plugin integration to encourage both roleplay and teamwork within a low inflation player driven economy. Towns are encouraged to be a center point of activity for both town members and guests with new mechanics such as the Tavern and Market systems.

*Processing img 2743wr0yyarc1...*

Enhance the vanilla experience with the famous Brewery Plugin with over 20 new drinks ranging from brews, coffees, teas, liquid orbs of origin, and more.  New coinvent recipes have been added to allow megabuild  projects to be more obtainable. We plan to continue to add more Quality of life changes over time.

*Processing img ai0w71gyyarc1...*

While PVP is not the primary focus of the server, players may join an optional PVP bounty system. The bounty system allows players to receive bounties and hunt others for monetary reward, but at the risk of losing some yourself.  Opted out players have defenses to discourage unwanted PVP.

*Processing img 80lgf26dxdcd1...*

We strive to have compatibility for as many players as possible. This means anyone can join even without mods, and allow players from Mobile, Console, Bedrock PC, and Java to play. We do not support cracked clients though, so you would need access to a Minecraft account

### Training

This training block has been absolutely massive. The goal for the second half of the year was ""PR in every distance from 5k-marathon"", and it started with a Pfitz 5k-10k inspired plan in the summer that lowered my 8 year old PR from 19:32-18:41 (and a year-over-year improvement on the same course from 22:04-18:41). I didn't take any real downtime between that block and the start of a Pfitz 12/70 inspired marathon block for CIM on December 8th, as I was feeling pretty good in August.

I'm 6 weeks into that marathon block and it's all gone pretty smoothly. I have nailed the workouts and long runs, and missed maybe 5% of the mileage. I've been dealing with minor niggles, but I got a massage a few weeks ago and those have seemed to disappear completely. Knowing that this was likely my only chance to PR in the half this year, I switched a couple workouts and long runs to be more half marathon focused. Here were some key sessions that I thought brought me the strength on race day:

9/3/24: 6x1k @ VO2 Max pace (5:50/mile average) - this one was very very tough to complete

9/14/24: 10k race (PRed in the 10k 39:56->39:52) - no need for a race report as it was a pretty bad day (more on that) but essentially a 40 minute unbroken tempo.

9/22/24: 17 mile long run with 2 x (2 mile HM pace [6:40avg], 1 mile float) near the end - ran this with a friend, definitely had a 3rd rep in the tank

9/24/24: 12 mile Pfitz MLR, finishing with 3.2 miles at HM pace (6:45 average)

10/05/24: 16 mile long run with 4 x (2 mile marathon pace [6:56avg], 1 mile float)

10/10/24: 9miles with a 5 mile unbroken tempo (6:30avg) - biggest confidence builder session of all

10/17/24: 10miles with 4 x 10' @ threshold (about 6:25avg)

My race on 9/14 was a PR, but I expected to run closer to 38 minutes. I went out way too fast, got a stitch midway through mile 4, and stumbled to a 4 second PR. I was really hoping to redeem myself on the half marathon.

### Pre-race

Took advantage of a scheduled down week to do a mini taper. Legs were feeling very fresh throughout the week so knew that I'd be ready on raceday.

I needed to wakeup and drive to the race location from my home in NYC, which took around an hour but was very smooth. I drank coffee with Maurten 320 CAF mixed in. Surprisingly not vile! The plan was to have around 300mg of caffeine pre-race, which I respond to quite well. I got to Rockland State Park with around 30 minutes to warm up. The Hudson Valley is in peak fall foliage, and it was about 40 degrees on race start so an absolutely perfect fall day to PR. Rockland Lake is famous for being extremely flat and fast (4 2.95 mile loops with a mile out and back to start) so I knew for certain that at least a PR was in the cards.

### Race

The plan was to take the out and back slow, and then hopefully settle in with someone who was trying to run 1:28 and finish fast on the last two loops. I turned on Dick's Picks Volume 12 in tribute to Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh, who passed away on Friday before the race.

### Miles 1-7

These make up the first two loops of the course. I quickly found two older guys running around 6:35 pace and asked if I could settle in behind them. One of them was a 2:29 marathoner pacing the other for an age-grade PR, so I felt very comfortable being behind them. The pacer was A+.

I felt suspiciously good these first two laps, it felt about like the middle-end of the Pfitz long runs. I was not looking at my HR but I think it probably would have been just above my easy range. The three of us trucked along with no issues whatsoever.

### Miles 8-10

I fought a small stitch this lap of the lake, but knew that if I controlled my breathing I could easily send it on the last lap. These were tough but manageable. I warned my pacer and running buddy that I would be ready to send it on the final lap, which they were totally on board with.

### Miles 11-end

The stitch was gone, and after a tough turn over a bridge I heard my buddy say ""I'm getting a cramp"" so I decided now was the time to make my move. I moved my pace closer to my 10k pace and dropped a couple people along the way to the finish. My splits between Strava and my watch are different, but I put in a 6:07 mile on mile 12 according to Strava that felt relatively easy.

In the second half of this race, I also managed to lower my 10k PR by twenty seconds, proving the race in September was absolutely a fluke and that I maybe had more in the tank on this day.

Smooth sailing in the finish to a 1:25:39.

### Post-race

I had some water and a coffee, cooled down, and drove back to NYC. I was glowing all day with joy, knowing that I have completed 3/4 PRs I was looking for in my larger yearly goal of PRing in every major road race distance. My 3:14:43 marathon PR is basically in the bag with another good month of training and no injuries.

Intro:

For anyone that hasn‚Äôt heard of the Wind River High Route, thanks for coming out from under your rock. The Andrew Skurka version is a roughly 97 mile route featuring 65 miles of off trail travel as it follows on or near the Continental Divide through the range. You climb a few mountains, cross numerous high passes, ford creeks, rock hop endlessly, and traverse glaciers. It is a now a fairly ‚Äúpopular‚Äù route, but we barely saw any people along it, and only happened across three others hiking it once we left the trailhead (two had taken the shuttle with us).

I‚Äôd first earmarked this route about 5 years ago and had planned for it to happen about 3 years ago but my hiking partner at that time had some injuries that made him nervous about doing it, so we opted for the Uinta Highline Trail that summer instead. This trip had been a long time coming for me and I was excited to say the least.

Day 0

My hiking partner and I drove up from Denver to the Trail Lakes trailhead, about a 7-hour drive, the day before starting our hike. We planned to stop in Lander to grab our Wind River Indian Reservation trespass permits and eat dinner. When we got to One Stop Market for the permits the clerk told us they didn‚Äôt have permits and would need to have his manager come in to provide more, we purchased a few snacks and planned our dinner stop while waiting. Unfortunately, when the manager arrived, she informed us that she didn‚Äôt have permits and wouldn‚Äôt be able to get more until Monday, unhelpful for us.

We left hoping that we would be able to snag permits somewhere else on the way back through tomorrow as it was already after 6pm and all the other listed options were closed. We had chosen Gannett Grill for dinner, and it turned out to be a pretty good choice. The food was good and reasonably priced, but a little slow although that‚Äôs to be expected on a lovely Saturday night. It worked out fine, my hiking partner had a little work left to finish up anyway before we left for the trailhead.

We arrived a little late, the sun was just dipping below the horizon, so we scoped out the trailhead before heading for some nearby campsites. The trailhead was relatively empty, so we didn‚Äôt have any hesitations driving the car to our site for the night. We fell asleep quickly thanks to the comfortable car camping setup we brought.

Day 1 ‚Äì 21.11mi, +6,873‚Äô, -3,274‚Äô, 9:50 Trailhead to camp

We are both early risers by nature so we were up and about shortly after 5am. We quickly packed up camp and made our way back to the trailhead. Like everyone else that does this hike we started off with the Wind River High Route Shuttle which was scheduled to show up at 8am. We ate breakfast and made final preparations as some more groups slowly rolled in, we made small talk with them but none were planning to do the WRHR.

We knew of one other group that would be on the shuttle with us, they somehow found my hiking partner‚Äôs lost sunglasses on the Pfiffner last year in the middle of perhaps the worst bushwhack, and without planning happened to be on the same shuttle as us this year. They rolled in around 7:45 and the shuttle showed up shortly after. A group of two and a solo hiker came out of the woodwork, making seven total on the shuttle. As we departed I asked our driver if we could stop for permits and he obliged, recommending a stop along the way that I hadn‚Äôt seen listed online anywhere. It‚Äôs a good thing we asked, because the other duo and solo hiker also needed permits.

We arrived at Bruce‚Äôs Bridge trailhead shortly before 10am, did our final final preparations, and appreciated the luxury of a pit toilet one last time before setting off around 10:30. We hiked briefly with the duo that found the sunglasses but soon found our pace to be slightly faster and were quickly alone. After the first mile or so the trail was pretty empty and we only saw a few people on the 14 or so miles to Deep Creek Lakes. This section of trail is nice, but compared to what lay ahead it‚Äôs fully boring so that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say about it.

We reached Deep Creek Lakes around 4:30pm, the weather forecast was calling for sporadic afternoon storms and we had heard rumbling thunder in the distance on the hike up but never hit rain. We usually start our days around 5am, so the ‚Äúlate‚Äù start and relatively short and easy miles left us itching to continue. We took a break at the lake which included a brief nap, a few snacks, and plenty of hydration. We checked the weather again and started making dinner as the sunglasses duo arrived at the lake. They made camp before coming to join us, but we had decided if the weather held we would push over Wind River Peak that evening.

The weather held and we left the lakes around 6:30pm. I expected the climb of Wind River Peak to be long but relatively straight forward, though it turned out to be a little more tedious than I expected so we didn‚Äôt end up reaching the summit until about 8:30. The wind had picked up and the sun was setting so we didn‚Äôt linger long.

Everyone who has looked at this route has the West Gully earmarked, it‚Äôs the first technical section and is often called the most difficult (why it‚Äôs not always considered the worst section of the route is beyond me). We expected steep and loose, which it was, but I did not expect the rocks to be as large as they were. It made for slow travel as we tried not to send rocks careening downhill onto each other. Luckily we had just enough light to see 95% of the route to the bottom before we pulled out the headlamps. At some point a fairly sizable rock shifted under my uphill foot and hit my downhill shin, it quickly swelled and had a small scrape but nothing was broken or bleeding profusely so we continued on. It turned out to be a bone bruise and the worst injury of the trip for either of us, all in all not that bad. The firm lump lingered a few months but has now receded.

In hindsight, the guide briefly mentions starting the gully from its head rather than traversing into it lower down as the map details. I was tempted to do that at the time and wish I trusted my gut, the traverse was also steep and loose, not fun to side hill across. I much prefer going straight up or straight down on loose rock.

As the grade leveled out we could breathe a little easier, but travel was still slow. We were still rock hopping and without light it was tough to tell if we were on the right track. We found some flat tundra, and given the clear night skies we easily called that good enough. Its was about 10:30pm and we were ready to call it a day, so we made camp. I decided to cowboy camp and was quickly in bed. After the trip we both said we were laying in our sleeping bags wondering if we really wanted to do this whole thing, with New York Pass and Douglass Peak Pass considered similar in stress and difficulty to the gully neither of us were feeling good. Nonetheless I slept soundly that night.

Day 2 ‚Äì 15.59mi, +3,845‚Äô, -4,816‚Äô, 12:45 camp to camp

We had agreed to ‚Äúsleep in‚Äù following our late night but I was still up and moving shortly before 6:30. In the morning light we both agreed going over Wind River Peak the previous day was the right call, it put us ahead of schedule and would make for a relatively easy day if we wanted to stay on schedule and meant pushing ahead wasn‚Äôt too much of a burden. Reviewing the map we decided to head for Black Joe Lake and eat breakfast there.

As we started off it quickly became apparent we had chosen the wrong side of the lake in the dark last night. The moraine we had to cross was made up of mostly car sized boulders that made for frustrating and slow travel. We reached slabs below and were finally able to pick up the pace, following an occasional use trail as we went. Reaching Black Joe Lake we continued on to the outlet before plopping down for a much overdue breakfast and more importantly coffee.

Big Sandy Lake, Jackass Pass, and the Cirque of the Towers lay ahead of us before lunch. I assumed this would be the most popular section of trail by a wide margin, it is noteworthy for beauty and rock climbing. We crossed paths with a few groups as we headed up Jackass Pass, but less than I expected. In the Cirque we only saw two groups with camps set up and a few people passing through. Less people than I expected to see but still the most of the hike by quite a bit.

After our lunch and siesta we headed for New York Pass, somewhat apprehensive of how it might go. The climb was mostly straight forward, but it was the descent I was most worried about. However, it turned out to be far better than expected, the short section of talus was mostly stable, then gravel and packed dirt offered much better footing. We descended quickly and in our high spirits stopped for a swim in the lake below the pass.

Passing Shadow Lake we came across a campsite with a father and his three sons out for a week long trip, it had been 35 years in the making and the dad was clearly ecstatic it was finally happening. We stopped and chatted for quite some time, both parties interested in what the other was doing and excited to share. From there the trail got stronger, it was fast and easy travel all the way to Skull Lake where we stopped for dinner.

Our original itinerary called for camping shortly after leaving the lake and we decided to stick to that so we could take advantage of a shorter day and set ourselves up to feel more rested as the trip continued on. We hiked through the forest for about 15 minutes before finding a good spot, I got some good stretching in and climbed in to bed before light faded. The worries following the West Gully had subsided and we both felt confident looking ahead. Our itinerary called for some long days, but that didn‚Äôt worry us much. Given the early night we set our alarms for 4:30am to get a slightly earlier start.

Day 3 ‚Äì 22.43mi, +7,789‚Äô, -7,487‚Äô, 15:26 camp to camp

I had a feeling that the trip would feel very different from this point, the previous days had been mostly on-trail miles but looking ahead we would barely see maintained trails until Glacier Trail where it would be 7ish miles back to the car. That feeling was quickly confirmed as we exited the forest and headed up the valley for Raid Peak Pass. We were hemmed in by sheer rock walls as we followed tundra and an occasional elk trail to the highest lake where we stopped for breakfast. Both of us were excited and feeling good, the extra rest and recovery made a difference.

The climb up Raid Peak Pass wasn‚Äôt bad, plenty of rock hopping but it was mostly stable and the steepest section near the top had a good stretch of packed dirt that lead easily to the top. The way down to Bonneville Lakes included some class III scrambling on slabs but it never quite felt class III to us. The lakes were crystal clear, and so began our constant remarking ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs some high-quality H2O!‚Äù My hiking partner had recently seen Waterboy for the first time (shocking) and the phrase was fitting, so it came out a lot.

The climb up Sentry Peak Pass was straight forward on tundra and mellow slabs. From the top we could see Photo Pass ahead of us and the route along the way. The descent included a few good sections of snow that we happily glissaded down. The largest section was a few hundred feet and neither of us managed to stay on our feet the whole way. The rest of the way to Photo Pass was straight forward, the worst section was some dense willow with no great route through. Before climbing the pass we stopped for lunch.

As we were eating the skies got darker but the forecast wasn‚Äôt calling for storms, we kept ourselves prepared for the possibility of some rain nonetheless. Photo Pass was an easy walk up-walk down pass and as we descended we talked about the gray skies once more, both agreeing that along with some clouds there was also suddenly much more smoke in the air. A quick check with our SOs at home confirmed no fires nearby but more smoke than previous days rolling in due to fires in the PNW and Canada.

This section through the reservation was frustrating, it started in a forest with no good handrails to follow, and the portion above tree line would only show a short section of the route before it dipped out of view. When I look back at my photos I realize I didn‚Äôt appreciate just how beautiful it was as I was too focused trying to figure out where to go.

We approached Europe Peak, and as I‚Äôd read so many times before the route was not obvious from a distance, but it became clear the closer we got. On the summit, around 6pm, we got hit with a few rain drops and snowflakes, the only weather we would run into on the trip. The terrain was rocky for some time, so we opted for snowfields when we could in order to save mental and physical energy. The skies were still gray, but the sun poked through some holes in the clouds on our approach to Golden Lakes, making for some dreamy views as the terrain changed to tundra, meadows, and wildflowers.

We reached Golden Lakes with good light left, expecting to quickly find a number of great camping options. However, we searched for some time and struggled to find anything we liked, eventually settling on a few spots as the sun was setting. We set up our tents, the only night I did that, and walked off to make dinner as darkness was setting in. It had been a long but rewarding day, we climbed three high passes and one mountain summit, only hitting a trail right at the end of the day. We wandered back to our tents and I quickly fell asleep, the skies cleared and rain never came in the night, I could have skipped the tent.

Day 4 ‚Äì 20.98mi, +6,201‚Äô, -5,791‚Äô, 14:52 camp to camp

Today‚Äôs hiking would include the sections I was most and least looking forward to. Alpine Lakes Basin was advertised as rocking hopping hell for 4 miles, and the North Fork Bull Lake Creek should be some of the best hiking and scenery of the trip.

Before any of that though we had to make it up to and over Douglas Peak Pass, the third and final feature that people often call nerve wracking but given how New York Pass went we were both more confident. We reached the lake below the pass after climbing away from Golden Lakes and sat down for breakfast in a sliver of warm sun. We eyeballed the pass and decided to go up and over the initial cliff band rather than try to climb under it. The rest of the climb was easy enough, and the descent was smoother than anticipated. While loose in places and steep it was never unnerving, we are both comfortable scree-skiing and did plenty of that.

Now in Alpine Lakes Basin I was somewhat taken aback, rather than a desolate basin of rock and hate I found a gorgeous area with beautiful lakes. Weirdly, this basin held the worst mosquitos, they didn‚Äôt seem to want to bite us but we both kept our mouths closed as swallowing them was a real risk. Working around the first lake did involve some rock hopping, and my partner‚Äôs worst fall of the trip (a slow-mo one where he wound up on his back like a turtle) but no major injury, just a few scrapes and bruises. After that we aimed for some tundra that involved a little more elevation gain and loss but was much smoother travel compared to the talus below. We continued to opt for tundra and slabs where possible even if it meant slightly more climbing or distance, aware that at some point we would be forced onto rocks.

Approaching the final lake we had to take account of a few cliff bands and decide how to traverse them. In both cases we chose the most direct routes and set off. Travel was still relatively forgiving, but we did finally get stuck rock hopping. Beyond the final cliff band we climbed the moraine and got our first up close view of a glacier. We‚Äôd both seen glaciers before, but this was easily the closest I had been to one. A milky blue pool sat below us, and I was very tempted to jump into it.

From the moraine to the top of Alpine Lakes Pass was more rock hopping and scrambling. In a few spots we could use the snow to our benefit but it was mostly too steep for our comfort since we didn‚Äôt have axes. Reaching the top of the pass we were both in high spirits, while crossing the basin did take time it was far less mentally taxing than either of us anticipated. Beginning down the pass we quickly came into view of a number of massive glaciers, leaking their milky blue melt into the valley below.

From here to Blaurock Pass I had to constantly remind myself to keep walking, I found myself mesmerized by the scenery around me. Looking up we were surrounded by steep rock walls of numerous mountains, with glaciers hanging off of them at impossible angles and snow fields tucked in every crevice. Below them began innumerable creeks fed by the melt, some crystal clear from the snow and others milky blue from the glaciers. When I looked down I was met by broad meadows teeming with wildflowers more vibrant than any I had seen before, and the small creeks coming from above met to form the vast creek we would be crossing down below. At one point we were walking through a broad and shallow creek with a bed of flat rocks that you could have convinced me was a cobblestone road from years past.

When I could finally form a thought beyond ‚Äúwow‚Äù again we came to our senses and stopped for lunch. We both could have spent the rest of the day, or even week, right in that spot. Before we ate, we jumped in the milky blue creek, only to immediately regret the decision. I know the color comes from glacial ‚Äúdust‚Äù, which might as well be silt and we were both covered in it. A nearby snowmelt creek offered a good spot to strip down and rinse the silt off ourselves and our clothes. Our clothes laid out to dry while we ate lunch, before falling asleep for another siesta. We woke up and stayed there a while longer, finding it hard to come up with a reason to keep moving when the most incredible place we had ever seen was at our feet.

Eventually we got ourselves together and started hiking again, I don‚Äôt know how long we sat there but it was easily the longest break of the hike. We took the shortcut toward Blaurock Pass and found ourselves awestruck again as the drainage came into full view. While the glaciers were hidden out of site this time, the rest of the panorama more than made up for it. This was one of a few times I‚Äôve felt the need to sit down and take things in on a backpacking trip, typically I will walk and take in the view. I sat there in silence while my hiking partner wandered off ahead.

I caught up with him and we made a plan for crossing the creek below, we‚Äôd managed to keep our feet mostly dry during crossings to this point and wanted to maintain our luck. We managed to do so and moved on toward the massive floodplain below the pass. The floodplain wasn‚Äôt totally swollen so we were able to walk around the edges of it with ease, the sand on its bed was surprisingly firm and provided a great route to the base of the pass. On the way up the pass we followed tundra as long as possible before rock hopping for a moderate section, and then finally reaching scree and gravel to the top.

Another glacier loomed on our descent and we discussed camping options. We could see some level tundra below us but the map called out some walled sites closer to Gannett Peak. We hemmed and hawed on the way down before settling on some nice looking tundra before the rock hopping began again. I fell asleep to the Milky Way glistening above me and Gannett Peak silhouetted against the night sky next to me.

Independent of each other, days 3, 4 and 5 would be the single best backpacking day of my life, but when I have to measure them against each other day 4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. Alpine Lakes Basin was far more beautiful than I expected and the travel was less tedious than anticipated. I had high hopes for North Fork Bull Lake and it blew those expectations out of the water. It was challenging without being oppressive, it flowed between smooth easy hiking and engaging route finding. After my wedding day, it is the day I would choose to relive over and over. I went to bed wondering how day 5 could even come close.

¬†

Day 5 ‚Äì 25.36mi, +5,518‚Äô, -8,563‚Äô, 16:59 camp to trailhead

Our first objective of the day would be West Sentinel Pass, a relatively short climb that would drop us onto our first glacier on the other side. We took advantage of the firm early morning snow and threw on the microspikes, which helped make short work of the ascent. I knew if day 5 had a chance to stack up to day 4 it would be the novelty and surrealness of walking across glaciers that would carry it. I‚Äôve done a fair amount of snow travel in various conditions, but glacier travel was totally new to me. Despite all of it being frozen water, the glaciers felt very different and I was in awe as the ice crunched below my feet.

We stopped for breakfast on top of Gannett Glacier, filtering the melt water to make our food and coffee. We decided to limit the amount of glacial melt we filtered as the silt quickly slowed the flow of our filters. A few boulders were sitting on top of the ice, making for a perfect spot to sit and eat in the sun.

Shortly after eating we dropped off the glacier and onto talus, there would be a lot of rock today so we opted to use the snow as much as possible while it was firm in the morning. We followed some wolf prints to the saddle before Grasshopper Glacier, thankful for some snow to make hiking less tedious. On top of the saddle the mountains in front of us were different than what lay behind us. Rather than deep valleys and steep rock walls we were met with broad and relatively flat expanses of snow, ice, and rock, making for an almost lunar landscape.

We found a clear snowmelt stream and took advantage, filtering water and backflushing our silty filters. As we approached Grasshopper Glacier the gravel and dirt along the way was soft, making it almost comfortable to walk across. Traversing the glacier would be the longest stretch of snow and ice we would cross, the lower sections where the snow had melted leaving the glacier exposed were fast easy. As we climbed snow covered the glacier, it was a hot day and the sun was shining so things got slushy and slippery, even with microspikes.

We climbed off the snow and soon ran into a large herd of mountain goats, the only noteworthy fauna we actually saw. Somehow before the trip I had convinced myself that grizzly bears did not inhabit the Wind River Range, shortly after the trip I learned that there is in fact a small population of them known to live in the Winds. In either case, we never saw a sign of any kind of bear and never saw anything bigger than the goats, I was disappointed by that as my hiking partner and I had a good track record of animal sightings on our hikes.

We dropped toward Iceberg Lakes Pass, stopping for lunch on a tundra covered ledge. The climb up the other side would be the last sustained and steep climb of the trip, it felt good to be looking at it with the afternoon still fully ahead of us. We finished eating and made short work of the climb, there was tundra most of the way and our packs were feeling light given the food we had eaten the past 5 days.

We crossed one last snowfield and made our way through a broad and barren stretch as Downs Mountain came into view, I was surprised by how close it was. The guide calls for 1 mile of rock hopping on approach to the summit, so we stopped for a snack as we made a gameplan. Usually our approach is to just take the direct route, even if it‚Äôs a little harder we prefer it to somewhat aimless wandering and zig zagging. In this case we saw a few ramps that looked appealing and decided to follow them, to our delight they held packed dirt and gravel which saved a fair bit of rock hopping. We were able to follow the meandering dirt most of the way to the summit.

In my mind, Downs Mountain was the end of the route, sure we had to get back to the car but all the hard stuff was done. I felt a sense of accomplishment I rarely feel, we had hiked the Wind River High Route and managed to stay on the primary roue the whole way. And it had only taken us 4.5 days to reach Downs. We enjoyed the view and blue skies while we discussed our options for the late afternoon and evening. Our original plan was to meet Glacier Trail and camp when we saw a good spot, but given the time and short hike to the trailhead from there we decided to re-assess when we reached the trail but would likely finish the hike that night.

We began the descent off Downs and I was quickly surprised by the rocks and steepness in front of us. I was expecting relatively easy travel but that‚Äôs not what we got. A large and steep snowfield offered a potential route, but my hiking partner didn‚Äôt like the looks of it so we opted to follow the rocks on it‚Äôs edges until the slope mellowed and we felt more comfortable on the snow. We filled up on water and headed for Goat Flat.

As we approached the flat we came across the only other WRHR hiker we saw after leaving our shuttle mates at Deep Creek Lakes. Crossing Goat Flat was relatively easy, it was easy to pick a distant point and keep walking toward it, we wound up a little south of the desired spot to begin the descent off the flat but nothing too bad.

As travel eased we took a look at the time and how much hiking remained to the trailhead. It was about 7:45 when we reached the trail and there were about 7 miles ahead of us, effectively downhill the whole way. It was an easy call to pull out some extra snacks and finish things off that night. We made good time in the light before we threw our headlamps on and pushed on. We both remarked how re-assuring it is to night hike with someone else and managed to make conversation the whole way down. It was just shy of 10:30 when we reached the trailhead. We took a moment to quietly celebrate, there was seemingly at least one person sleeping in their car and we didn‚Äôt want to wake them. It had been a long day so we quickly made camp and climbed in bed.

¬†

Final Thoughts

We got really lucky with the weather, 85% of the time we had clear blue skies, we only heard distant thunder once and it was when we were well below treeline, and rain only hit us once with just a few drops. We were also prepared to take advantage of the good weather, our packs were light and we were fit so the long days came with relative ease. A few weeks prior we attempted to finish off the Pfiffner (lots of snow and the Devil‚Äôs Thumb fire pushed us off the route last summer), and in the course of that we had a day we covered 26+ miles and 9,000+ ft of climbing so we knew we had it in us. Even then, this was easily the most physically, mentally, and emotionally challenging hike I have ever done.

Overall, the route is stunning. The mountains change as you head north, becoming more and more desolate and unwelcoming, but awe inspiringly beautiful the whole way from Wind River Peak to Downs Mountain. The route finding is mostly straight forward but planning days and camping locations can be difficult, especially the northern sections. I would not recommend this as a first off-trail adventure, the terrain is difficult and the bail out options, flatly, suck. But for experienced hikers this is a bucket list worthy hike, I recommend you make the time for it if it interests you.

Gear

For the second summer in a row the major pieces of my kit are mostly the same (excluding my new MYOG shelter, but I prefer to cowboy camp as much as possible). I still love my Red Paw Packs Flatiron, but nearly 6 days of food is as much as it can handle, and if I were to do it again I‚Äôd probably get a slightly larger pack so I could pack a little more diverse food. \~24lbs starting out was pretty uncomfortable, but after the first day things felt much better.

The Uberlight and Thinlight combo worked really well, I never felt a chill given the very good weather. My Katabatic Alsek continues to hold strong, and was plenty warm on this trip.

Hello,

I‚Äôve owned this coffee grinder for quite some time, but unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt receive any information about the manufacturer when I acquired it. There‚Äôs no brand name or identifying mark on the machine, and even the bottom of the unit lacks any stickers or labels.

I was hoping you might be able to help me identify it. My issue is that the plastic part shown in the second image has broken, and despite using Google‚Äôs reverse image search, I haven‚Äôt been able to find a replacement.

Thank you in advance for your help!

1ge4fbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ge4fbm/das_wunder_von_bern_germanys_july_4th/,"""Das Wunder von Bern"" (Germany's July 4th?)","Without too much exaggeration, the game in Bern could be considered a kind of German July 4th (the game was played on 4 July 1954).

In '54, much of Germany was still in ruins, not only w/r/t to housing and infrastructure etc, but the whole ""spirit"" thing was very wobbly.

Getting your ass kicked militarily and then shown to have committed unimaginably horrific crimes against humanity will do that to a nation.

The ""Wirtschaftswunder"" (aka economic miracle, really though ""economic reboot"" might be a better descriptor) was off to a good start for corporations and industry leaders (""die dicken Bonzen""), but was just kicking off for working class folks (those¬† who had survived the war, which had ended just 9 years earlier!) who had lost most all possessions / housing / livelihood.

Some were still trickling in from Soviet and other eastern front POW camps after years in pretty horrific captivity. The last POW returned in 1955.

The survivors of the war (mostly old people and women and their children at this point btw) tried to scratch out a living in a country teetering on mass starvation, without a functional healthcare system, and dubious housing security (actually dubious security across all sectors of what today we'd consider essential to human survival).

The economy, as the engine to power most of these sectors, was entirely nonfunctional after the war. Under Hitler, the currency had been the Reichsmark.¬† However,¬† by 1945, that currency had become worthless in practice, and ""real"" goods like cigarettes, coffee, gold, sex were often used as makeshift means of exchange. Obviously, you can't run a country's economy on sex and cigs ;).

So, in 1948, under Allied occupation and direction, the¬† ReichsMark was replaced by the DeutscheMark.¬† This was part of the effort to re-form the economy. Btw: this whole move from ReichsMark to DeutscheMark reads like a Bond thriller and has tons of Woah!! moments.

But, in short: the new banknotes were distributed on Sunday, 20 June, 1948.¬† In exchange for 60 ReichsMark, every citizen of the western zones received 40 DeutscheMark directly from the ration offices, followed by a further 20 DeutscheMark in a second tranche shortly thereafter.

As of 21 June, the DeutscheMark is the sole legal tender. Everyday payments such as wages, salaries, insurance, and rents were converted at a rate of 1:1.

However, those with savings (and Germany had been a nation of ""savers"") were hit hard:¬† ReichsMark balances were converted to DeutscheMark at a rate of less than 1:10.¬†¬†

Obviously, any abrupt transition to a new currency would be tough in any country.¬† But in a country in literal ruins, with a substantial percentage of the male workforce dead, injured, in captivity, on the run ... well, you get the idea ...

Remember¬† what I said about ""money in the bank"" taking a hit?¬† Yeah, retirement payments (which weren't extravagant to begin with) were included in that.¬† Look at it like this:

\*\*If you had 100 ReichsMark saved, you'd see a 90+ ReichsMark loss.  


\*\*Anybody with money in the bank looked at balances close to zero.¬†  


\*\*Old people, i.e. the generation that had gone through WW1, and tried to rebuilt after the Great Depression, now were hit again.  


\*\*During the ReichMark years, women who mostly had not worked (enough) outside the home to earn the required ""points"" to be eligible for retirement benefits on their own--they had relied on their husbands' earnings and/or retirement. With the husbands out of the picture (temporarily or otherwise) and any financial support essentially first (i.e. in the last year of the war, 1944/45) drying up little by little, and then collapsing completely, women and their children were up the creek in really unimaginably awful conditions.¬† In some occupied sectors of Germany, rapes and sexual exploitation by the occupiers reached epidemic proportions.  


So, yes, the victory in the World Cup in 1954 did a lot to improve¬† Germans' morale after the war years¬† and the post-war struggles which is also reflected by a newspaper's headline after the final: ""Wir sind wieder wer!"" (""We're somebody again"").¬†

Let's also remember that the miracle of Bern was preceeded by the debacle in Basel on June 20, 1954.  In  front of 60,000 spectators, in the preliminary round, the German team had suffered a catastrophic, humiliating 3:8 defeat against that ""invincible"" Hungarian team.

The unexpected victory of the German football team over the heavily favorite Hungary on 4 July 1954 has gone down in history as the ‚ÄúMiracle of Bern,‚Äù and because the German public were starving (sometimes literally),¬† the football match was easily mythologized beyond what a World Cup final¬† normally engenders.

The impact that the match had on the public was made possible/intensified for the first time in the history of the World Cup through the widespread use of modern media such as radio and television.

Although the tv broadcast of the final in Germany reached only the approximately 40,000 private/in-home receivers available at the time, every pub, every theatre, every public place, and every store front (an early public viewing!) had set up a clunky black and white tv set. Today, the picture quality would lead to riots; back then, every available TV in the land hosted throngs of people, so that the actual number of viewers was probably close to a million.

During the month-long competition, masses of people had tuned their nervous antennas to the events in Switzerland (football fan or not--my mom, in her late teens at the time, told me that she and her roommate bought a radio just because of the World Cup and had studied up -- which involved pub visits to chat with Ruhrpott experts about the beautiful game).

The pent-up tension¬† was released after the game in highly (considering Germans) emotional outbursts and displays: strangers embraced, hugged, kissed, laughed and cried and danced in public for long into the night.

The emotional impact / power of the ‚ÄúMiracle of Bern‚Äù might be tough to appreciate for non-Germans or Germans born long after the event.¬† A comparative event --in the post-war period-- might be the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9. November 1989.

Eventually the ""Wunder von Bern"" and the¬† ""Wirtschaftswunder"" linked up in the public's imagination, and the date became a kind of German 4th of July (with the TOR, TOR, TOR yelling of¬† reporter Herbert Zimmermann operating as a weirdly attractive soundtrack/hymn to underscore it).

I think it's important to not fall victim to a dangerous re-writing and mythologizing of history and sports-washing of this event at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, which was already glorified by contemporaries as a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù and quasi sacralized.¬† A myth of the German (re)Birth of a Nation, if you will ...

Myths are narratives in the context of collective historical experiences, beyond the dusty academic study of historic events: dates, names, places.¬† But they are also always more than narratives, politically neither neutral nor innocent, but convey the interests of social interests of social groups, can be integrated into political conceptions, and legitimize them. Thus, these myths are more than just stories, because they create political meaning. They structure the past and have an influence on the present. At their most toxic and dangerous extreme, myths re-write history and write/white out the ""unsuitable.""

The so-called miracle was based 100 percent on hard work, often by people (especially women) whose names are not glorified in the history books.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


This is a really nice docu, with video and audio--especially the TOR! jubilation--of the game, as well as interviews with players, players' wives, members of the viewing public etc (warning though: don't read the commentary; it's way beyond the usual toxic shit I'm used to from youtube):

I‚Äôm really grateful for the chance to stay with them while I get back on my feet. I‚Äôve been working hard, saving up for my own place, and paying a portion of rent and groceries to show I‚Äôm contributing.

The issue started when my stepdad began criticizing how I spend my time and money. He‚Äôs constantly commenting on how I‚Äôll ‚Äònever save up‚Äô if I go out with friends, buy takeout, or get anything for myself beyond the basics. I understand that he wants me to be responsible with my spending, but I also want to enjoy my life a bit and feel like an adult with my own choices. Every time I buy a coffee or a new piece of clothing, he makes some passive comment like, ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre keeping track of your expenses!‚Äù or ‚ÄúMight want to save those pennies if you‚Äôre serious about moving out.‚Äù

Last night, he got especially annoyed when I came home late after spending time with friends. I decided to talk to him and explain that while I appreciate his advice, I need space to make my own decisions and handle my own money. I reminded him that I‚Äôm an adult, that I‚Äôm contributing to the household financially, and that I do plan on moving out when I have enough saved. I asked if he could trust me to make the right choices for myself.

He didn‚Äôt take it well. Now, there‚Äôs a lot of tension at home, and he‚Äôs barely speaking to me. My mom is caught in the middle, and I can tell it‚Äôs straining her too. I‚Äôm beginning to feel guilty, wondering if I was out of line by being so blunt. Part of me feels like I should be allowed to make my own choices without so much commentary, but another part wonders if I‚Äôm being ungrateful by asking for independence while living under their roof.

With the husbands out of the picture (temporarily or otherwise) and any financial support essentially first (i.e. in the last year of the war, 1944/45) drying up little by little, and then collapsing completely, women and their children were up the creek in really unimaginably awful conditions.  In some occupied sectors of Germany, rapes and sexual exploitation by the occupiers reached epidemic proportions.


So, yes, the victory in the world cup in 1954 did a lot to improve  Germans' morale after the war years  and the post-war struggles which is also reflected by a newspaper's headline after the final: ""Wir sind wieder wer!"" (""We're somebody again"").  

Let's also remember that the miracle of Bern was preceeded by the debacle in Basel on June 20, 1954. 

In front of 60,000 spectators, in the preliminary round, the German team had suffered a catastrophic, humiliating 3:8 defeat against that ""invincible"" Hungarian team.

The unexpected victory of the German football team over the heavily favorite Hungary on 4 July 1954 has gone down in history as the ‚ÄúMiracle of Bern,‚Äù and because the German public were starving (sometimes literally),  the football match was easily mythologized beyond what a World Cup final  normally engenders.

The impact that the match had on the public was made possible/intensified for the first time in the history of the World Cup through the widespread use of modern media such as radio and television. 

Although the tv broadcast of the final in Germany reached only the approximately 40,000 private/in-home receivers available at the time, every pub, every theatre, every public place, and every store front (an early public viewing!) had set up a clunky black and white tv set. Today, the picture quality would lead to riots; back then, every available TV in the land hosted throngs of people, so that the actual number of viewers was probably close to a million. 

During the month-long competition, masses of people had tuned their nervous antennas to the events in Switzerland (football fan or not--my mom, in her late teens at the time, told me that she and her roommate bought a radio just because of the World Cup and had studied up -- which involved pub visits to chat with Ruhrpott experts about the beautiful game).

The pent-up tension  was released after the game in highly (considering Germans) emotional outbursts and displays: strangers embraced, hugged, kissed, laughed and cried and danced in public for long into the night.

The emotional impact / power of the ‚ÄúMiracle of Bern‚Äù might be tough to appreciate for non-Germans or Germans born long after the event.  A comparative event --in the post-war period-- might be the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9. November 1989. 

Eventually the ""Wunder von Bern"" and the  ""Wirtschaftswunder"" linked up in the public's imagination, and the date became a kind of German 4th of July (with the TOR, TOR, TOR yelling of  reporter Herbert Zimmermann operating as a weirdly attractive soundtrack/hymn to underscore it).

I think it's important to not fall victim to a dangerous re-writing and mythologizing of history and sports-washing of this event at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, which was already glorified by contemporaries as a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù and quasi sacralized.  A myth of the German (re)Birth of a Nation, if you will ...

Myths are narratives in the context of collective historical experiences, beyond the dusty academic study of historic events: dates, names, places.  But they are also always more than narratives, politically neither neutral nor innocent, but convey the interests of social interests of social groups, can be integrated into political conceptions, and legitimize them. Thus, these myths are more than just stories, because they create political meaning. They structure the past and have an influence on the present. At their most toxic and dangerous extreme, myths re-write history and write/white out the ""unsuitable.""

The so-called miracle was based 100 percent on hard work, often by people (especially women) whose names are not glorified in the history books.

This is a really nice docu, with video and audio--especially the TOR! jubilation--of the game, as well as interviews with players, players' wives, members of the viewing public etc (warning though: don't read the commentary; it's way beyond the usual toxic shit I'm used to from youtube):

1ge3w2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1ge3w2m/college_guide_how_to_survive_college/,College Guide: How to Survive College,"Hey y‚Äôall! Hope everyone is doing well! As I continue into my first year of graduate school, I have been thinking back to my undergraduate years and how lost/confused I was when navigating schools. So, with my past four years, I am going to put my tips and tricks to surviving college! This will be split into three sections: Dormitory/Housing, Academics, and finances. You can feel free to add in, agree, or disagree! This has been my experience, but I know there are many out there with different experiences. Enjoy!¬†

Prior to starting, I feel the need to add this in. Community college is something that is debated a lot, and if I were to go back five years ago (putting athletics aside and purely financial), I would have absolutely taken the route to community college. Financially, it is the smartest option (in my opinion); for those who are able to, staying up at home and saving money off of rent/housing/meal plans is absolutely amazing. Yes, there might be limitations in the classes at community colleges, but the fact that you are getting a degree AT ALL is amazing! There is no shame in community college, and it really is an amazing avenue for anyone looking to get a degree. Of course, there are limitations in regard to the types of classes and degrees offered, but community colleges, as a whole, are financially highly recommended and once you get your degree, you can choose to transfer to a larger college if you wish. ¬†

Ahem, anyways. Let‚Äôs get on to it!¬†

**MAJOR DISCLAIMER: This post is too long, so part 2 will be in the comments (or an entirely different post depending on length)**

**Disclaimer: There will be a few cusses in here, but they will be censored. It is all lighthearted!** ¬†

**Disclaimer Two: All links to products will be at the bottom of this entire thing. I am not sponsored by anything, so please no company sue me or that‚Äôd really suck.**¬†

¬†

Dormitory/Housing: Ah, so you finally made it to college! No more mom, no more siblings, no more curfew, just you and the REAL world! You‚Äôre a little nervous, but that‚Äôs alright! Everyone else is as scared/nervous as you are! You go through orientation (God that took so many hours, right?!), and everything sounds absolutely amazing. Plus, you got a bunch of free t-shirts, bags, and cups. However, as you make your way to your empty dorm, you can‚Äôt help feeling doubt clouding your mind. Totally cool. Let‚Äôs go through a couple questions and recommendations that I have for a wide variety of people!¬†

¬†

**1.** You are super excited to get into your room and start decorating! You have been waiting for this since you were fourteen (or even younger). The world is your oyster, you have Pinterest boards, written writeups, and you and your roommate are ready to take on the world. Well, except you realize that buying these decorations is really f-ing expensive. You got to target, and oh my goodness a single plush throw is THIRTY-FIVE FLIPPING DOLLARS. You have five hundred dollars in your back account and a dream (if even that)! Everyone is always saying how Target is so affordable, but for me, I have found it to be the biggest scam. They charge you a lot for what is supposed to be actually affordable. However, don‚Äôt you worry, I got some tricks for you!¬†

Okay OP, so where am I supposed to go? Target? Walmart? The thrift store? Well, believe it or not, you can shop at Target and Walmart, and I have a few links to where you can find affordable items for those stores with different items. But I have a few better spots that are more financially friendly for college students.¬†

The first spot(s) are TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. I know I know; you can walk into one of these places and leave with 400$ worth of stuff in a blink. However, when it comes to getting small things such as: bedding, blankets, rugs, and tubber ware, I find these sister stores to be a god send. I have gotten nearly all my towels from HomeGoods. ¬†

Good towels can go for 10$ which can be pricey, but there is a deal at HomeGoods (or sometimes Tj Maxx) where they have a set of towels (Rachel Zoe, Tahari, Ecotery, etc.) that include: two bath towels, two wash clothes, and two hand towels for 24.99$. Y‚Äôall, you don‚Äôt need forty-seven towels, I have five bath towels I rotate and three towel turbans that I use for my hair. You can reuse your towels (cleaning them of course). The reason I say to go to Tj Maxx of HomeGoods is because a Rachel Zoe towel set can run you 50 + dollars easily. Of course, if you don‚Äôt want a towel set, you can get individual towels from 6.99-12.99. But, as I say, that is a pretty penny. I suggest these sets, however, there are other stores that offer similar options! Those include target, Walmart, bed bath and beyond, and Khol‚Äôs (just to name a few!). I have a few options at the bottom of this entire thing! The only downside for TJ Maxx and HomeGoods is their website is pretty bad, so I would recommend going in person.¬†

Okay, so towels! Damn you can go on a long time about towels. What about bedding? Rugs? And all that other jazz? HomeGoods is my go-to for bedding, entirely so. You can get good sheets sets for 19.99 and blankets for 14.99 and on. I prefer to not use a comforter and just drown in over the size throws. In addition to HomeGoods, you can also try Ross, where I found a bunch of similar things for the same prices so and so. Links will be listed below for sheets and blankets.¬†

Important note! You, yes you. I am talking to you. Some folks don‚Äôt know this, but it is recommended to clean your bedding every two weeks. It can be a hassle, especially if you want to do nothing but sleep, but if you want to feel clean in the morning and after a shower: clean your bed sheets and blankets. I do so every two weeks, and some folks might scream, but I put my sheets in the washer and dryer and just run it either hot or warm water. For blankets, I tend to do a warm setting, and I always always always do heavy load setting. Get that filth out. You and your roommate will thank you for cleaning your bed sheets.¬†

**Tip 1**: I recommend having two to three sets of bed sheets; yes, you heard me right. I have two ‚Äúgood‚Äù sets of bed sheets that I switch on and off while cleaning the others. I then have one kind of mid set of bed sheets that I use for ‚Äúif only I am too lazy to clean the others one‚Äù. It makes life a helluva lot easier if you don‚Äôt feel like washing your bed sheets, so you can just pop the new ones on and put the other ones to be washed later on.¬†

**Tip 2**: Because this doesn‚Äôt fit with the above, I recommend using queen or even king-sized bed sheets (I use queen). The reason being that there is nothing I hate more than waking up with my bed sheets coming off of my mattress and sleeping on an icky mattress pad or mattress. Having queen or king sets, you don‚Äôt have to worry about that as much.¬†

The second spots I like for decorating purposes are: five below, dollar tree, dollar general, and Target/Walmart 1,3, and 5$ shops. Now now, I know what y‚Äôall are thinking: didn‚Äôt OP just bash target and Walmart? Yes, I absolutely did. Just hear me out. I know, like me, y‚Äôall likely want some rad lights, calendars, clocks, etc. But then you go to a normal place and a set of string lights are 15-30$. Like, my brother in love, what??? My favorite spot to go for cool nick knacks is 5 below. You can find a bunch of room decorations in that store, from lights, calendars, clocks, random decorations, etc. Listen, if it‚Äôs for decoration, it doesn‚Äôt need to be super expensive. Additionally, dollar tree and dollar general are also adequate for said decorations. I just found five below and Tj Maxx/HomeGoods to be the easiest for decorations.¬†

Okay, now you‚Äôre probably like: OP what about the whole Target Walmart thing? Well, you see, this is my one tidbit about these two dudes. There is a section y‚Äôall see with these two which are the 5$ and below section. These are tailored specifically for college students (and those of us who definitely are not responsible with money), and you can find a lot of neat (small) decorations for cheap! Just be careful how much you add to cart cause that can get expensive. ¬†

The third spots I like for general laundry detergent, lights, batteries, soaps, etc. are discount stores. Not sure exactly what‚Äôs around y‚Äôall but where I am we have an Ollie‚Äôs bargain store. It is a little bit overwhelming, but with a few deep breaths, you can find main brand laundry detergent, dryer sheets, soaps, cleaning supplies, etc. It will be expensive anywhere to get these cleaning and basic supplies, but I find that bargain stores are your best bet for trying to save any money at all. ¬†

¬†

¬†

**2.** Now you‚Äôre probably thinking: holy f\*ck OP we get it, you like shopping and have probably spent an ungodly amount of money on blankets. Yes, you‚Äôre absolutely right. I have. And do I regret it? No. Does my bank account regret it? Yes. So, let‚Äôs get along with dorm life recommendations. ¬†

Okay, OP, I have read this far: what should I know about laundry? Well, my friend, I am glad you have asked. You see, your school has likely done the thing where they stuff a bunch of people in one dorm and have given them 2 washers and dryers for 100+ people. And suddenly, it‚Äôs Sunday afternoon and you realize you have no clean clothes, and when you try to go to the laundry room, there are people hogging the washers and driers. Oh, and you go to grab your laundry from the drier (literally a minute after it ends) and you catch someone taking your stuff out and putting theirs in. Like, yeahhhhh, no. ¬†

My recommendation for this conundrum is a bit unusual. Some might like it, some might not. So, when my weekends come around, I know lots of folks will have gone home, out partying, watching football, etc. For boring people like me, I do some of that stuff. However, in the late evenings (and I mean 12 ‚Äì 4am) I like to do my laundry. No one is here or awake, and no one is certainly worrying about laundry when they can be getting wasted at a bar somewhere. Guess when I wrote this entire thing? Yep, 2:30am doing my laundry. You don‚Äôt have to worry about folks stealing your laundry, you don‚Äôt have to worry about having enough washers and driers. ¬†

The downside to this method? You have to be a night owl. You have to be willing to suck it up and be up at the ungodly hours. If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll probably be doing a research project, scrolling through reddit, or watching football (I don‚Äôt have much of a social life let‚Äôs be for real). So, I get the apprehension. If you want a more reasonable time, then you can likely do it earlier in the morning (8am ‚Äì 10am) when folks are getting ready for lectures. There‚Äôs a better chance you can get washers and driers. If you have a day where you have nothing to do, then I recommend the night before getting your washing and cleaning done, that way you can crash without consequences when you are done.¬†

Thanks for the tips OP, but how do I even wash my laundry? So, I am not the best person to ask for this. Personally, what I found has worked for me, is putting all my colors together and then all my whites together (I do not promote racism; I am talking about clothes, people). I always wash on hot, heavy load, and normal settings. I want my clothes cleaned, y‚Äôall. I don‚Äôt care what the labels say (unless what I am washing is expensive). Additionally, I always dry my clothes hot or warm (depending on the material). If it‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôs probably air dry or no heat, I would recommend doing that varying on directions. ¬†

Okay, but what about even loading the washer and drier? A common question for those of us who haven‚Äôt really done laundry before. You know what‚Äôs embarrassing? When you overload the washer and suddenly there is water all over the floor and a washer out of commission for an entire dorm. Then suddenly you get an email to everyone from your RA telling them to NOT OVERFILL THE WASHERS. Couldn‚Äôt be me (shivers). So, what do we take from this? It is going to be annoying, but you cannot fill the washer to the rim. Firstly, your sh\*t won‚Äôt get cleaned, and secondly there‚Äôs a good chance you will overflow the washer. I fill the washers just over halfway and run my cycle.¬†

Then there is washing detergent and all that fancy stuff. Before even loading my laundry, I put one pod in of laundry detergent and then a whole cup of the smelling stuff (idk what it is called). If you are an athlete, I recommend doing two cups of laundry smelling scent stuff. Also, if you are an athlete, you need to wash your clothes regularly. I know I should not be the one telling you this, but it is better that I tell you this than your roommate or RA. ¬†

¬†

¬†

**3.** Okay, OP thanks for the lecture about laundry (you probably). But what about my roommate? What if I am anti-social as f\*ck? Well, to be honest, if you‚Äôre on reddit, then you got your answer. No, I am just f\*cking with you. College is a scary place, especially if you‚Äôre introverted. Your parents, like mine, probably have said ‚Äúthis is your place to reinvent yourself‚Äù, thanks mom and dad. And while you probably think your parents are trying to just have your back, they are actually right. This is something I haven‚Äôt done particularly well since going to my new graduate school. It is scary, man. Especially coming in with completely different people, and (if like me) from a completely different part of the country. ¬†

Okay, so what do I do? For me, I play on a sports team. I have found that consistently interacting with these people has given me a social outlet, and we all bond together over something we are passionate about. You are going to have a bunch of different people in one place focusing on the same goal. Yet, it does not just have to be a sport. It can be a club, it can be a football fantasy league, it can be a meet up with a group of people for a club named ‚Äúsocializing 101‚Äù. Listen, college is scary. You need to meet your groups of people; that is something I am still learning myself. You don‚Äôt need to get stupid drunk to meet folks, you don‚Äôt have to change yourself. Finding people in your classes is crucial, try to make study groups. Sometimes, you have to just approach a person and ask them if you can have lunch, talk about school, or something. It‚Äôs scary as hell, but that is one way I made genuine friends. ¬†

What if I am unsure about my roommate? Oh buddy, let me tell you, I have horror stories about roommates. You have heard stories about roommates. Your 3^(rd) great uncle Joe has horror stories about roommates. We ALL do. Realistically, when going to college and knowing no one, it is super difficult to find a roommate randomly that you f\*ck with. What I highly recommend is taking that charting thing FR. Talk to these folks, get to know them. And if you get there and y‚Äôall hit it off like two peas in a pod? Hell yeah. ¬†

However, if you get there and you KNOW it ain‚Äôt gonna last longer than Aaron Rodger‚Äôs Achilles last season, then what I recommend is talking with your roommate about possible issues that they have and how you can sort them out. If that don‚Äôt work, talk to your RA. They don‚Äôt get paid enough to deal with that, but they will try their best to sort it out. They‚Äôre human, so please be nice to them. And if that does not work, approach the housing resource station (or whatever it is called) and ask them to switch. Explain the situation to them, that you have talked with the RA, and that it is just not going to work. There‚Äôs a good chance you will ruin someone‚Äôs year with that e-mail that the open spot in their dorm room has been taken over, but there is a 90% chance it will be better than before. And, if you‚Äôre lucky, they might have room for a double that is unoccupied. ¬†

If all else fails and you know you will be miserable with anyone, then I would recommend doing the scary thing and looking into a single. It will be more expensive, that is factual. But, if you‚Äôre like me and genuinely cannot have a roommate due to medical issues, then looking into a single is important. It might be worth more, but it also comes with peace of mind. If you know that you will struggle having a roommate no matter who you live with that is a sign that this might be the right path for you.¬†

**Tip 1**: If you have a disability that can be supported by doctor note/diagnosis, reach out to the ADA department at your school and there is a chance they can put you in ADA housing. This is almost always a single for those who have a disability. It can be a struggle to go through, but it is one of the ways that those with disabilities can get the housing appropriate for them.¬†

\*\*Tip 2\*\*: Do not miss out on room selection. It may be at 6am in the morning on a random Tuesday, but if you miss out on signing up for a good dorm or put on the lottery, you will hate yourself. Have a plan. You need to have a plan; someone you want to have a room with (or a plan for a single you want) and be ready to go to war. Folks will be refreshing wanting that one golden dorm. If you are even an hour late (overexaggerating for some colleges), then you are getting the worst dormitory in the school (the one where the only two toilets on the floor are always clogged or out of order and the community kitchen is always gross and being used). So be prepared. ¬†

¬†

¬†

\*\*4\*\*. Okay, so: buying stuff, laundry, and roommates, that‚Äôs great and all, but here are a few miscellaneous things that don‚Äôt really fit with the rest. First thing first, I‚Äôm gonna lecture you on bedtimes, routines, and all that. If your parents haven‚Äôt done it, I am going to. Unlike me (it is currently just past 3am now), you need to have steady bedtime. It is not elementary school, but you need to have a bedtime you try to stick to. For me, I have work in the mornings, so I am typically going to bed around 12am and waking up at 7am. Except you, my child, needs to be sleeping 7¬†to 9 hours a day. Sleep is crucial to learning, surviving, and all that jazz. Don‚Äôt trust me? Take it from Cornell, UNC, even the freaking CDC. You can probably survive at 4, 5, or 6 hours. But do I recommend it? No. Not only will your learning retention be shortened, but you will feel like shit. It does not matter how much coffee you get or how many sodas you down, you need your damn sleep. ¬†

OP I need to study though? And I have sports? Like, what do you expect of me? I get it, as a STEM major and college athlete, getting sleep is ridiculously difficult. What you need to do is have a plan. You need to plan out your assignments, you need to stick to a studying schedule, and you need to stick to a routine. It is so easy to get carried away at 2am watching videos on how to build a fortress out of toothpicks. We have all been there. But then you have to be to practice at 6am and suddenly you can‚Äôt fall asleep for the life of you. Then it is 330am and you get a little bit of sleep and then BEEP BEEP BEEP, your five something am alarm is going off. At that point, was it even worth getting sleep? ¬†

So, in short, you have to work in a routine. Find one you can work with, whether it is going to bed at 9pm or 1am. Yes, I said 1am. If you can at least be steady and work in a system that you are used to, then you can learn to deal with the schedule presented to you. ¬†

So now you‚Äôre probably thinking about the lecture I just gave you. What about down time? Like, seriously OP, when am I supposed to even have time to myself? That‚Äôs the thing, college is supposed to be amazing, and you have all this down time. And you tell yourself ‚ÄúI just survived high school that went on for 8+ hours a day this is nothing,‚Äù but if you tell yourself that then you are falling into a trap. Listen, we all survived high school (or some sort of prior education), and it is unbelievably easy to think that with so much time on your hands, you can do anything you want. And I mean anything. ¬†

Your studies are important; some people put all their time into their academics and all the power to them. Some of them are athletes, and they find themselves struggling to balance academics and athletics, which is also valid. And some of us have managed to figure it all out by managing to keep it up for 32 hours a day and have no problem. No seriously, we all know a person like that.¬†

In reality, despite college appearing to be an open door to free time, you really need to be careful. Go to your damn classes, eat properly, attend social meetings, study, and then set aside 1 ‚Äì 3 hours to yourself. This can be in the evening; this can be spread out over the day. Just take some time, listen to music, work out, walk, nap, do something to help clear your mind out. If you don‚Äôt, then you are going to go crazy. I would know it, believe me, I have been there and done that. ¬†

¬†

\*\*Lastly\*\*: relationships. Okay, we are ready, what do we really know about love? If you read this, you‚Äôre kidding yourself, we are on reddit y'all. No, I am playing (cries in forever alone). So, you have arrived at college, you‚Äôre going to class and see the prettiest or most handsome guy, gal, or pal you‚Äôve ever seen. You are flabbergasted wondering how such an attractive person is in front of you. And, like a dream, they approach you, y‚Äôall strike up a conversation, and two months later you are engaged. Listen, I am all for relationships, find your person. However, do not rush into marriage, especially as a freshman. You‚Äôre still learning people; you're still learning who you are. The girl you‚Äôre seeing? That‚Äôs actually the football captain‚Äôs sister, and he is an angry linebacker while you‚Äôre a 5‚Äô9 tight-end. AKA, unless you get to know her, make sure you don‚Äôt rush into anything. ¬†

Of course you don‚Äôt need me, a redditor, to lecture you. You are your own person. But I just really want you to consider not rushing into anything without knowing the person. I am not saying to not get into a relationship, just make sure you like the person for who they are and not for the thrill of being in a relationship. ¬†

¬†

¬†

\*\*Academics\*\*: Well well well, you‚Äôve managed to get past housing/dorms. You have your courses set up, class times ready, and a dream to get that 4.0. Woo! Exciting! Here‚Äôs how you can get those good grades. I, personally, was a 3.3 student in my undergraduate (B- to A student). So, take my advice with a grain of salt. The general things that will be covered here are: realism, coursework, and so on.¬†

¬†

\*\*1\*\*. I want that 4.0! How do I do it? Well, hello there! You‚Äôre here and you‚Äôre in class. You get to your class fifteen minutes early, seeing the rest of the fresh faces who are also attending that class. You enter into the lecture room, take a seat close to the professor but not front row so you don‚Äôt get picked on. You do this four or five more times and after the end of the first week you think that you got the hang of it. Well that, my friends, is called the syllabus week. ¬†

You either have three types of classes: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (each 50 min), Tuesday and Thursday (hour and fifteen minutes), or one day a week for three hours. I personally don‚Äôt mind any of these besides the three hour one. Why is that, you may ask. It‚Äôs only once a week! How hard can that be? And you will ask yourself that when you are an hour and a half in with a lecture talking about different types of cell mechanics in sunflower seeds which you have no interest in because you‚Äôre an English major. ¬†

So let me be realistic with y‚Äôall for a second, you can absolutely get a 4.0. Folks who do put a whole lot of heart and soul into what they do. For me? Once you get to upper-level courses (STEM major), suddenly those easy courses get real hard. You could get a 40 on an exam and be ecstatic because the second highest grade was a 22. It doesn‚Äôt matter how hard you study, at times, there are professors that will screw you over. This leads me to my very first tip (one you have likely heard before) which is: rate my professor.¬†

You‚Äôve heard, your mom has heard it, and remember your 3^(rd) great uncle joe? Yeah, he‚Äôs¬†heard of it too. And this website is not just there to show you pretty numbers, when you are scheduling your classes, go to the f\*ing websites and look at your professors. If they have a 1 star rating with 45 reviews, try to avoid that professor. Think of it was a food service. Do you really want to go to a professor with a 2 star rating with the average commentator saying that the professor puts questions on the test the range from who wrote Romeo and Julliet to how to do chi squared? Yeah, me neither. This leads in my next point and, if you are here, possible the most important thing I am going to say in this entire thread:¬†

\*\*MEETING WITH YOUR ADVICE EARLY AND REGISTER AS SOON AS CLASSES COME OUT.\*\*

My god, I can not scream this into the void enough. For me, I went to a smaller school, so I guess it would be easier to get advising appointments in. However, y‚Äôall, especially with classes that are lower level (which multiple folks in different majors have to take), you ¬†need to be early with registration. Your advisor will you give you suggestions on classes and give you a schedule which is adequate for your time. It is your responsibility to make sure you have that lined up, with professors you like, and are ready to register (accept the class schedule) the minute it becomes available. I am telling you right now, every single person who can register early will register early. It is going to be another 7am it opens sort of thing (like with dorms), and if you are not there quick enough, you are going to be stuck with the Mr. Smith who is an ex-police officer ‚Äúresigned‚Äù from duty for doing illegal activities and the only way he can get credit time served (a job) is to work at the college teaching you children about literature from the 1800s (he doesn‚Äôt even have a degree). ¬†

I mean this whole heartedly when I say do your f\*cking researching. Your life will be so much easier if you put the effort in and ensure that you are ready to enroll as soon as it becomes available. If you don‚Äôt, you will hate yourself. Remember, rate my professor is like yelp for professors. Do you want a professor that I will go out of their way when a class doesn‚Äôt perform well on the test to go over questions for extra credit if everyone participates? Or do you want Mr.Smith who is teaching or else his ex-wife will sue him due to a few too many restraining order violations? ¬†

¬†

\*\*2\*\*. OP how do I even contact my professor? What if I am not doing well in class but they do not have office hours when I need it? My friend, let me tell you a quick story. It was my freshman year, and I was taking anatomy and physiology one. I was doing alright except for the practical(s). By alright I mean I was scraping with a 71 and a dream. I realized that if I dropped to a 70, I would fail that class. It‚Äôs my last module in that class and there is a good shot I don‚Äôt pass. So, what did I do? Did I A. ignore my problems and focus on studying for the next two weeks straight B. beg my professor for extra credit C. cheat on my exam with answers given from Mary Jane for 100$ in exchange or D. go to the professor and ask what to do? If you answered D, you would be correct. And you know what that professor did? He 1. helped me with some of the content I was not understanding and 2. recommended I go to the tutoring center.¬†

I, someone who had a 3.8 out of high school, suddenly was looking into ... tutoring. What blasphemy was this?! Except, it was not blasphemy. In fact, tutoring saved my grade not just in A&P 1, but it allowed me to understand the rest of the classes I was struggling with. For most of my undergraduate, I would schedule lessons with the tutoring center (twice a week per class I was struggling with), and we would go over details on what I had issues with, how to go about them differently, and why they were answered the way they were.¬†

My teacher explained to me like this: going to a tutor who has taken the class with that professor before is like getting a cheat sheet for the exam. The tutors have to have maintained at least a 90 in that class within the past three years. All the tutors I went to had notes from those classes, past exam questions, and they could answer questions I had on homework. They didn‚Äôt have past exam copies, necessarily, but they were able to answer questions I had that regarded to possible test questions. You guys don‚Äôt know how helpful it is to ask a tutor what possible questions will be on the exam, and they explain it to you and then, look at it, those exact questions (with varying amounts) are on the exam! ¬†

Thanks for the lecture, OP! But what if I can‚Äôt find a tutor in the subject I have? What if my class is upper level or there are no tutors that have the time availability for me? The thing I figured out as I was finishing my bachelor's degree is that you NEED to contact your teachers. Some may of office hours, but there is often the idea that if you can‚Äôt reach them during office hours, they won‚Äôt be able to get to you at all. Sometimes you might be able to make office hours; yet, if you can‚Äôt, you just have to reach out to your professor. Talk to them after class, make an email thread, do whatever you can to establish that you have questions and need help. Ask them if you can come in sometime other than office hours. I promise you that they will say yes, especially with upper-level professors. They are there to help you, and you have to be willing to reach out for that help. ¬†

One class that I established a tutoring schedule with was with my Spanish professor. I started it in Spanish 2, and when I got to Spanish 4 I was doing relatively okay. However, despite my attempts to learn Spanish, I was still greatly at a disadvantage compared to my classmates. Why? I don‚Äôt know, I just sucked at Spanish. So, I reached out to this professor, and we made a tutoring schedule 2 ‚Äì3 times a week for fifty minutes. We would go over the contents that I was struggling with and then the contents of the next lecture. This gave me a heads up on what we would be talking about that next day so I wouldn‚Äôt feel so nervous. We did our lectures entirely in Spanish, and let me tell you, I couldn‚Äôt understand a peep of what he said. But, with having the tutoring sessions in English (AND ACTUALLY COMMMUNICATING WITH MY PROFESSOR) I managed to get my first B in Spanish. ¬†

This is one example. I have also had tutoring in parasitology (amazing professor but difficult class), genetics, A&P 2, and so on. Even now, in my graduate program, I have established connections with professors to ensure that I am doing the best I can to understand the materials. My classes are asynchronous, but I still reach out to my professors when I don‚Äôt understand something. We sit down and meet to discuss questions I have. And if you can‚Äôt find a time that works, talk to them. Leave an e-mail chain. SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING.¬†

It is best to do ANYTHING than struggle in silence. Professors do not what to see you fail, it‚Äôs their job to ensure that you are able to do the best you can. If there is one thing you take away from this post it is this: get tutoring if you don‚Äôt understand something, reach out to your professors directly. It is different in big schools, I get that. But the same thing applies to TAs and other tutoring centers, there are sources there to help you, you just have to admit that you need help. ¬†

\*\*Note\*\*: Y‚Äôall have heard the term ‚ÄúCs get degrees‚Äù, and darling, guess what, that is true. Listen people associate with Cs by scraping by, and once you get to genetics and geriatric care, yeah, you‚Äôre gonna be a bit nervous and confused. Some folks are great at courses like that, some people study real hard and get those good grades. For folks like me who are average (maybe even a bit dumb) but try hard to get an average grade, good on you. Sometimes we have to realize that just because you got a C does not mean you are any lesser than someone who got higher. Y‚Äôall are both important and both passed. Some folks are super smart and work incredibly hard to get those grades, all the power to you guys. Me? Well, I worked incredibly hard and scraped by. It‚Äôs okay to not have the highest grade, as long as you are doing what you absolutely can, then all the power to you. ¬†

¬†

\*\*3\*\*. You wake up at 7am on Wednesday and look at your alarm clock knowing you have to be at lecture from 8 to 10. You dread it, and you can‚Äôt help but ponder why you waited to the last second to register and ended up with an 8am five days a week. You decide to skip the class; what‚Äôs the worst that happens? Well, some people can afford class. Some professors don‚Äôt take attendance. Yet, as you move up class levels and the class sizes get smaller, professors will start taking attendance. You can skip a certain number of classes before failing. Listen, you have your own willpower! It is your choice! Skip those classes! ¬†

No, please don‚Äôt. I am completely serious when I say you need to attend your classes. You miss one class and suddenly you are completely lost. It‚Äôs one class, then two, then four, etc. It can fall apart so quickly. I am not saying you can‚Äôt skip one or two classes (hell, I have done the same). However, once you realize you are missing too many classes and your grades start to slip, when does it stop? You have to realize that missing classes will lead to consequences. This can be getting worst grades or even being dropped from the class. It is not worth it y‚Äôall. This is not something I will settle on; you need to attend your classes. You will regret it, I promise you. ¬†

¬†

\*\*4\*\*. You‚Äôve seen this little website going around, it is said to make college life much easier. Just a little enter into the search bar and suddenly you have a whole essay or research product in seconds! You submit, surely thinking that it is better than anything you have ever written. You get it back and huh?! A zero! What is this mayhem! You just failed the class, and now you can never show your face to that professor ever again.¬†

You know what I am talking about folks: chat GPT. Well not just chat GPT but other AI sources as well. Listen, AI can be an absolutely amazing source. But it is not an amazing source for writing essays and projects. I know it can be so tempting to just open that website and click that little button, all your worries \*poof\* gone. Suddenly there is the AI checker, no problem, you‚Äôll try a different website that totally gets by the checker. Hahaha, no. You see, unlike the AI checker, your professor actually reads your essay. The AI checker might not detect AI, but your professor sure as hell will be able to smell the bull sh\*t meter a mile away. Don‚Äôt believe me? I have seen students get dropped from classes for during in an AI generated project or essay. Your professors will not be pleased about this, I promise you. It showcases that 1. you don‚Äôt value their time and 2. that you don‚Äôt know the material (or can‚Äôt present that you do). ¬†

This is not just chat GPT, as stated, there are other websites that offer these services in return for easy essays or projects. Guys, listen, just do your work. No magic AI center can convey understanding like a person. AI genuinely scares me. I know a lot of folks think AI is great, but I believe that there are limits to how good something can be. Once people start using AI to try and make it look like they understand concepts (that they don‚Äôt), then suddenly there are grades administered to people who don‚Äôt really understand topics. And while you can say ‚Äúyay, I passed that class because of AI‚Äù, you realize that a lot of concepts build off of concepts that you used AI to look up. And, suddenly, AI really does not do a lot for you.¬†

I am not saying all AI is bad, in fact, there are two AI features I use in all my projects. That being scribbr and mybib. You see, one thing you will learn to do (a lot) is cite. You cite sources for EVERYTHING! And you know what I don‚Äôt want to do when I have been staring at a paper for the last eight hours and am all finished to realize that my sources are not cited yet? I do not want to f\*ing cite fifteen sources manually. So, you know what I do? I pop my sources into scribbr or mybib and their AI will find the sites and cite it for you. It is not doing the project for you; it simply cites the site/source provided and gives you an accurate citation. I use these two for anything I needed citing for (MLA, APA, Vancouver, etc.), and it is the only AI I am really thankful for within my academic journey. Mybib and scribbr links will be at the bottom of this document for your availability. They require no sign up or fee.¬†

\*\*Note\*\*: Citation machine is also a good source! I find it to be a little more of a hassle with the ADs and sometimes not being able to get all the information when it is literally right there. However, it can still be a good way to cite if needed. ¬†

\*\*Note 2\*\*: You know what is important? Communication. Listen, we are talking about everything; communication is crucial for everything in your life. It starts with college, where it is your turn to take charge of your life. You are given freedom, but you also have to realize that you have responsibilities that come with those freedoms. There is no better time to start working in communication than college. It can be with professors, friends, team mates, room mates, and so on. One thing I have learnt in college is how to speak up for myself. I used to be quiet and very nervous to advocate for my well being. However, once you get to higher education, you realize that your parents, siblings, or Uncle Joe are going to advocate for you. They might for the first few months, but this is the part of your life where you realize your parents can‚Äôt be the ones speaking for you. The example I use is making phone calls. ¬†

Something that is so easy yet so daunting. I remember in 9^(th) grade I had to miss a sports practice, and I had to call my captain but had a full-blown mental breakdown and started sobbing. I then called her (when practice was already over) telling them I would not be able to make it to practice. Yeah, not my finest moment. But now? Yeah, I get nervous to make phone calls. But if you don‚Äôt learn how to initiate communication, then it will haunt you for the rest of your life. Only YOU can stop forest fires ‚Äì no wait, only YOU can initiate communication in order to make your life easier. I am not saying that your parents are to stop from helping in everything. Last month I called my mom because I couldn‚Äôt get my sickle cell documentation, and I was so fed up with EVERYTHING. I had spent 200$ on a test/labs when I knew I did not need them. I had waited in an urgent care for two and a half hours, searched through every documentation and email I had, and I STILL could not find the documentation. Calling my mom as a last resort, it took her fifteen minutes to get the documentation from an old pediatrician. It‚Äôs okay to have parents help you out, but you have to realize that you need to be the one to initiate communication (most times). Thank you mom, by the way. ¬†¬†

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

¬†

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn‚Äôt say anything.

¬†

I needed a job‚Äîsomething to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a caf√© just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

¬†

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

¬†

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the caf√©: Love & Coffee.

¬†

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The caf√©‚Äôs simple elegance, with its white and brown d√©cor, felt inviting.

¬†

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I stammered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?‚Äù

The day before, he admitted he was in a bad headspace, feeling down about a work project‚Äîa YouTube channel he‚Äôs trying to launch. He filmed the first video, hated it, and asked about our plans, seeming like he was hoping to have time to work on it.

I suggested we reschedule our plans and take the day to work on the video instead. I know he can get fixated when stressed, so I thought working on it might help him relax and enjoy the day more. But he got upset, saying that I ‚Äúalways make things about me‚Äù and that we weren‚Äôt canceling my birthday to work on his video. I explained I was just trying to help, but he shut down and got defensive, saying he didn‚Äôt want to talk about the plans. The conversation got heated, and he eventually yelled and told me to leave him alone.

The next morning, I apologized, saying I should‚Äôve been more understanding and given him time to unwind before bringing up the plans. I also admitted birthdays are emotional for me because I tend to see them as a time when people show you how much you matter (I know that‚Äôs not totally rational). But he was distant and even mocked my feelings a bit, saying I was making things all about me. Still, he said he wanted to go ahead with our plans.

The day itself felt tense. We went to a Halloween town, but he barely spoke, walked behind me, and didn‚Äôt join me in the shops. I tried to check in, but he gave me short replies and insisted everything was fine. I cried quietly in the car on the way home, feeling hurt and confused.

When we got home, I thanked him for lunch and coffee, then went outside to smoke. Normally, he‚Äôd join me, but he stayed inside. When I asked him to hang out, he said he didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be a good idea with me being stoned and him sober, so I offered to sober up. He said he‚Äôd come out ‚Äúin a while,‚Äù but he never did.

Later that night, I tried to explain my perspective over the past two days, wanting to understand where we went wrong. He said I was blaming him and not taking responsibility, and that our relationship felt broken. He ended by saying he doesn‚Äôt know how to fix things, then went to bed. I stayed up, cried, ate ice cream, and watched *Hocus Pocus* until I fell asleep.

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first.

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the caf√© began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn‚Äôt even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration‚Äîone I hadn‚Äôt heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

‚ÄúDrea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought‚Äî""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn‚Äôt want to drag you into my mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúMessed up?‚Äù I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I‚Äôm so sorry, Drea. I promise, I‚Äôm not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren‚Äôt alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. ‚ÄúOh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids‚ÄîIsla and Josh.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? ‚ÄúOh... hi,‚Äù I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Isla‚Äôs third birthday today,‚Äù Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

‚ÄúHappy Birthday, Isla,‚Äù I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúThank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!‚Äù

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. ‚ÄúYes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.‚Äù

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch up with you later, Adrian,‚Äù I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian‚Äôs family lingering for Isla‚Äôs birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the caf√© and mentally kicked myself. I‚Äôd forgotten to get Adrian‚Äôs number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn‚Äôt managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

‚ÄúDrea,‚Äù a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. ‚ÄúI was just coming to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù I blinked, surprised. ‚ÄúI thought you left hours ago.‚Äù

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. ‚ÄúI did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.‚Äù

I nodded, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúYeah, we do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to take a walk?‚Äù

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn‚Äôt want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Adrian‚Äôs voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. ‚ÄúYou got married.‚Äù

I shot him a sideways glance. ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? It was all over the news. Didn‚Äôt you see it?‚Äù

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù

He laughed softly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You‚Äôve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.‚Äù

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn‚Äôt lie to him. Not after everything we‚Äôd been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real, Adrian.‚Äù

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a business deal,‚Äù I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. ‚ÄúMy parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.‚Äù

Adrian‚Äôs expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. ‚ÄúDrea‚Ä¶‚Äù

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Adrian. I am. I‚Äôve learned to deal with it.‚Äù

His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn‚Äôt have let this happen.‚Äù

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. You couldn‚Äôt have known.‚Äù

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn‚Äôt work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here?‚Äù

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed‚Äîthough I couldn‚Äôt quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just come inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe door‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt open,‚Äù I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. ‚ÄúDid you try using your fingerprint?‚Äù

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. ‚ÄúUnbelievable. Now we‚Äôre locked out.‚Äù He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn‚Äôt help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he‚Äôd let me in‚Äîboth literally and figuratively.

I am making a list of things for her to follow including a routine, a rough daily schedule and some preferred activities that I would like her to do with my baby girl. My LO takes 2-3 naps a day and has 4 wake windows that are  3 hours long each (totalling 12 hours of total awake time). My husband and I are there for the first & last wake window, which leaves about 6-7 hours alone with the nanny. As parents, we do a lot of free play activities with her, like I will be cooking, cleaning, folding laundry with her around me watching, or go to a coffee shop with her etc. But I feel like a nanny cant use up the time like that. We live in NYC, so we are in a apartment vs. a house. And as it gets cooler, keeping her outside for long periods of time is also going to be tough.

Here is what I have so far, but I feel like that may not be enough? Let me know if you have any other suggestions!

We all know customers who come in, buy a single coffee, and then set up shop for hours, taking up space and using the wifi. It‚Äôs a tricky situation because no one wants to make people feel unwelcome, but this can limit space for other paying customers.

The Solution: What if there was a ‚Äúplug and play‚Äù feature that integrates directly with your POS and wifi system? With each purchase, the customer gets a unique wifi code printed on their receipt, granting them 1-2 hours of wifi access. When the time expires, so does the code, prompting them to make another purchase if they‚Äôd like to stay longer.

This way, customers naturally move along or buy another item without any awkward conversations. 

Would this be something you‚Äôd be interested in for your cafe? Curious to hear your thoughts!


EDIT: Not sure if this is just in my city but I see many cafes that say now laptops, no meetings, time limits for seating etc. (not sure if that‚Äôs because of people staying too long)",93,1730125640.0,smallbusiness,153,0.85,False

We got coffee, walked around for a few hours and then went back to his place and hooked up. I def thought he was attractive and the hookup was OK - maybe a little awkward at parts, we had just met and were both totally sober lol.

I text him a bit after - maybe coming on a little too strong - and he ends up saying that he didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôre a match but he‚Äôd be down to be friends (to this day: I‚Äôm not sure if he meant he‚Äôs not looking to date how I might have seemed to, or he‚Äôs just not attracted to me period). The summer goes by and we‚Äôre both busy with our own lives, but he ends up reaching out 2 months later in September and we hang out (as friends).

Now, for the past 5-6 weeks, we‚Äôve been hanging out every weekend, usually for 4+ hours at a time. Taking walks, getting food and drinks, playing sports, etc. I feel there is some level of chemistry re-emerging between us but I haven‚Äôt said or done anything because I want to respect him ‚Äúfriendzoning‚Äù me back in July. Some additional context is that he isn‚Äôt fully out and is likely not emotionally available, but I‚Äôd even be happy to be FWB or be slightly more ‚Äúintimate‚Äù friends. I‚Äôm not head over heels, but increasingly been having some ‚Äúmore than friend‚Äù type thoughts that have been getting harder to ignore.

I am trying to figure out whether it‚Äôs worth saying something, if it‚Äôs possible that his feelings have changed. Now that he has become a friend, I‚Äôm also wary of doing anything to fuck that up‚Ä¶

I moved out of my parents house almost three years ago. At the time, I had a roommate and my rent was around $800 with utilities included. With my job, that was more than okay as I was making close to 4k a month working two jobs. I got to live my life, and about a year ago I decided to go back to college for engineering(I dropped out during COVID) so I quit my second job to make time for my degree. At the end of last semester, I got the news that our landlord was kicking as out (long story, but tl:dr don't open your home to people you don't know well) and my roommate decided to make the jump to live with her GF. I tried to find a place to live with my partner, but we had been dating for less than a year at the time and at the last minute they backed out, leaving me scrambling to find a place. The cheapest place I could find on such short notice was $1850 (almost 2k with utilities and internet) a month, which as someone making 2.8k a month is a huge strain (on top of other bills). It's been close to 6 months and my credit card debt is racking up, not to mention the fact that previously I was paying for school and now I have to take out loans. Most of the money I saved up previously went into deposit and moving fees (went from fully furnished to not).
I am considering moving in with my parents. I'm trans and they do not accept it, or my identity, or my mental illnesses, or a thousand other things, but I feel like I can't afford to live like this and I am living outside my means. They're not abusive per say, but they definitely like the idea of having a kid but not me. My mental health will take a hit but at least I won't be checking my bank account with dread and trying to find every last dollar. On a less serious note, I am experiencing extreme fomo- most of my friends are out doing things and I can't afford to go out unless it's a quick coffee or something. My best friend has been covering me for more expensive things but I feel bad always making her pay for two. 
The other option is beg my partner to move in with me, but I don't think they ever will. They talk about how they really want to but they never will (they rent for 1k, and most two bedrooms go for 2.5k around here, so there is no financial motive. They are scared if they move out and things go wrong, there is no back up plan for them).

As someone who's always looking for ways to brighten my smile, I was excited to give this product a shot.

The kit comes with everything you need to start whitening at home. I found the process easy to follow, and I liked that I could use it while watching TV or doing other tasks. The extra strength pen was a nice bonus for targeting specific spots.

I noticed a slight change after just one use, which was encouraging. The gel didn't taste bad, and it didn't make my teeth feel sensitive. I've used it a few times now, and I can see a difference in the color of my teeth.

One thing to note is that the device needs to be recharged after about two uses. It's not a big deal, but it's something to keep in mind if you plan on using it often.

# Bottom Line

If you want to brighten your smile at home, the Auraglow kit is worth a try. It's easy to use and shows results pretty quickly. 

# Overview of the Auraglow Teeth Whitening Kit & Extra Strength Pen

I recently tried out the Auraglow whitening kit and pen. The kit comes with a LED light device and gel, while the pen is for quick touch-ups. I found it easy to use at home. The gel didn't taste bad and didn't make my teeth sensitive. After a few uses, I saw my teeth getting brighter. The pen was handy for targeting specific stains. I liked that I could see results pretty quickly. The device battery lasted for two 30-minute sessions before needing a recharge. For tough stains, I had to use it twice a day. Overall, it worked well for me, but it takes some time and effort to see big changes.

# Whitening Gel Efficacy

I was impressed by how well the whitening gel worked. After just a few uses, I noticed my teeth looking brighter. The gel is easy to apply and doesn't have a bad taste. It seems to dissolve quickly, which is nice. For tough stains, I found using it twice a day worked best. The pen was a standout feature for me. It's great for touch-ups and targeting specific spots. I saw coffee marks fade away after about 5 days of using the pen. While results may vary, I think most people will see some improvement. The gel and pen combo seems effective for general whitening and tackling stubborn discoloration.

# Extra Strength Whitening Pen

I was eager to try the whitening pen that comes with this kit. It's super easy to use and fits nicely in my hand. I noticed a difference after just a couple uses. The pen is perfect for touching up specific spots or quick whitening on the go. It's not messy and doesn't have a bad taste.

I like that I can target stains from coffee or tea. The pen works fast - I saw results in about 5 days of regular use. It's great for maintaining whiteness between full treatments with the LED light.

One drawback is that the pen runs out pretty quickly if you use it often. But it's so handy that I don't mind getting refills. For best results, I use it twice a day on tough stains. The pen is a nice bonus to the full whitening kit.

# Ease of Use and Application

Using this kit is a breeze. I found the process simple and quick. The pen is easy to handle and glides smoothly over teeth. It takes just minutes to apply the gel and turn on the light. The mouthpiece fits well, even in my small mouth. I didn't need to fuss with it. The pen is great for touch-ups on the go. I like that I can use it anywhere, anytime. The kit holds enough charge for two full sessions. I just had to remember to plug it in after each use. The gel doesn't taste bad and dissolves fast. I was able to see results after just a few uses.

# Battery Life and Charging

I found the battery life of this teeth whitening kit to be quite good. The LED light lasts for multiple treatments without needing a recharge. When it does need more juice, charging is quick and easy. I just plug it in for about an hour and it's ready to go again. The pen doesn't require charging at all, which is handy. I like that I can use the LED light for several whitening sessions before having to think about the battery. It's nice not having to charge it constantly between uses.

# Pros and Cons

After trying out the Auraglow whitening kit, I've got some thoughts to share. This product has its ups and downs, so let's break it down.

# Pros

* Quick results: I noticed a difference in my teeth's color after just a few uses.
* Easy to use: The kit is simple to figure out and doesn't take much time.
* Versatile options: With both a kit and a pen, I had choices for how to whiten.
* Good amount of product: There's plenty in the tube to last for multiple treatments.
* Effective on coffee stains: The pen worked well on my coffee marks.

# Cons

* Battery life: The device only holds a charge for two 30-minute uses.
* Multiple applications needed: For tough stains, I had to use it twice a day.
* Solution dissolves fast: I found the whitening gel doesn't last very long in the mouth.
* Slight taste: While not horrible, the product does have a noticeable flavor.
* Small mouthpiece: It fits, but might be tight for some users.

I liked that I saw changes quickly, even after one or two treatments. The pen was handy for touching up specific spots. For best results, I needed to use it more than once, which took some time. The short battery life meant I had to remember to charge it often. While it worked well on my coffee stains, it took about five days of using the pen to see big changes. The taste wasn't bad, but it was there. If you have a larger mouth, the fit might be snug.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this teeth whitening kit for a few weeks now, and I'm really impressed with the results. Many users report seeing a difference after just one or two uses. The pen is a standout feature - it's quick, easy, and effective for targeting coffee stains. I found the gel dissolves quickly and doesn't taste bad, which is a plus.

The kit is user-friendly, even for those with smaller mouths. Some users recommend using it twice daily for stubborn stains. One thing to note: the device's charge only lasts for about two 30-minute sessions, so remember to plug it in between uses.

While most reviews are positive, results can vary. Some people see dramatic changes in just a few days, while others might need more time. Based on my experience and other feedback, this Auraglow kit seems to be a solid choice for at-home teeth whitening.

# Safety and Sensitivity

I found the Auraglow kit to be gentle on my teeth and gums. The gel didn't cause any irritation, which was a relief. I have sensitive teeth, so I was worried about pain, but I didn't experience any. The pen was easy to use without making a mess. I liked that I could target specific spots. The instructions were clear about how often to use it safely. I made sure to follow them closely. It's important not to overuse whitening products, and Auraglow made that easy. The kit felt safe and well-designed for home use. I'd say it's a good choice for people new to teeth whitening who want to be careful.

# Conclusion

After using the Auraglow kit for a few weeks, I'm impressed with the results. My teeth look noticeably whiter, even after just a couple of uses. The LED light and gel combo works well, though the unit needs frequent recharging. The pen is a standout feature - it's great for quick touch-ups and targeting specific stains. While it may take some time to see dramatic changes for heavy stains, the gentle formula didn't cause sensitivity for me. The kit is easy to use and fits comfortably, even for smaller mouths. For the price, it offers good value compared to professional treatments. If you're looking for an at-home teeth whitening solution, the Auraglow kit is worth trying.",1,1730124945.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False
