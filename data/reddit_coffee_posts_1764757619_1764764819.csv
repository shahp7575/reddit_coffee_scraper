1pd2r6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeSaaS/comments/1pd2r6w/i_built_a_viral_app_clone_in_4_hours_using_ai/,I built a viral app clone in 4 hours using AI tools and zero coding skills - here's my exact workflow,"Just shipped my first mobile app using nothing but AI tools and I'm still shaking. No joke, this took me 4 hours from idea to working prototype.

**Here's the stack that made me feel like a 10x developer:**

🎯 **Step 1: Finding Gold (30 mins)**

* Headed to Sensor Tower and stalked the trending apps
* Found an app blowing up with 500K+ downloads in 2 weeks
* Analyzed what made it addictive (spoiler: simple concept, perfect execution)

🧠 **Step 2: Claude Did the Heavy Lifting (45 mins)**

* Fed Claude the app concept
* Asked it to generate: UI/UX design specifications, complete MVP term sheet, feature breakdown, user flow descriptions
* The output? *Chef's kiss* \- more detailed than my college thesis

🎨 **Step 3: Design Magic (1 hour)**

* Took Claude's specs to Google Stitch (stitch (dot) withgoogle (dot) com)
* This tool is INSANE - it turned my text descriptions into actual UI designs
* Got screens for onboarding, main feed, user profile, settings
* Everything looked like it came from a $10K designer

⚡ **Step 4: Build Time (1.5 hours)**

* Grabbed the designs + Claude's MVP term
* Threw everything into Rork
* The AI literally built the mobile app while I grabbed coffee
* Made a few tweaks and boom - working prototype

**The Hook:** What took dev teams weeks in 2020 now takes ONE PERSON an afternoon in 2025.

**What I learned:**

* You don't need to code anymore, you need to know how to ORCHESTRATE AI tools
* The barrier to entry for app development is officially dead
* Finding the RIGHT idea (via Sensor Tower) is 10x more valuable than coding skills

**Am I going to launch this?** Hell yeah. Already setting up TestFlight.

**Tools used:**

* Sensor Tower (free tier for research)
* Claude AI (for specs/design docs)
* Google Stitch (stitch (dot) withgoogle (dot) com)
* Rork (for the actual build)

I am 34 and incredibly unattractive to women, I've never been able to hold down a job, my Autism is too complex, I need to live in a supported home with 5 other Autistic men and care workers. I cannot even tie a shoe lace. I cannot handle money. I cannot buy groceries on my own.

And when I hear Neurotypical people, especially women, moaning ""Oh I'm 25 and still not setteled down with kids and married"" they act like it is absolute end of days and they vocally display they are miserable because of it.

But when I go through this severe realization that there is no clear sign of any future of me ever setteling down with a woman with kids, it makes me incredibly depressed and missionless as a 34 year old and my care workers moan at me for stop being depressed all the time and go take anti-depressant pills..

My life is just wake up and do chores with my fellow Autistic housemates, get the house in shape and then watch a little TV and then take turns on our shared computer do a little surfing, do my hobbies, then sleep. Not much of a mission. I feel this primitive urge to raise children with a woman that's not accomplished.

The care workers when I tell them about my depression of not setteling down at 34 is ""Oh, you need to accept it, you were born with a disability, you are complicated, you cannot take care of yourself, you can't take care of a baby, you also have hereditary Autism, it will pass to them, there's no way you can take care of a baby with that, when you have it yourself, plus it will be unfair to give a baby Autism from your DNA, you need to accept you can't have it"" And they act like I am able to just instantly say ""Ok, I accept it"".

But Neurotypicals will be crushed! They would never be able to just instantly accept it. There's this coldness that we are to just accept bad fates quicker than Neurotypicals... It's sad.  
We aren't even allowed to grieve we are told ""Oh well, the worst thing EVER, you'll never have a future, never have a child that looks like you to raise, you'll never have a beautiful wife that tells you she loves you to spend the rest of your life with, oh well, accept it"".

I've seen couples go into depression and crying because the woman's womb is not working or the man's sperm isn't working and try and try and try and they cry without kids. But they are allowed to grieve. I'm not? I gotta just say ""Oh well I can't, I wont be succesful reproducing organism I was put on Earth for, oh well"".

And I've had conversations with girls on dating sites who are my age, trying to just get my first date. I just search for girls to go on a date with my age at a coffee shop or watch some TV together and have like a little date. Not realizing that's a teen thing to do. These women at 30+ want a serious comitted settle down, they don';t want little coffee shop giggles.

And they run from me (not only because I am 5''7 and bald and unattractive and Autistic with no house of my own and not financially supportive) but the baby they'll have will have hereditary Autism and they're in ""settle down mode"" and absolutely run to the hills as I'll get in the way of that ""settle down mode""..

So I really don't know what to do. I've heard the tired ""Get hobbies"" over and over. I have so many hobbies, that everytime I move in my bedroom, I hear a ""CRASH!"" or dusting and polishing my room takes hours, because all of my clay sculptures I've filled my room with. It's still not a replacement of love and being a father..",1,1764764596.0,autism,1,1.0,False
1pd2qe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CELPIP_Help/comments/1pd2qe3/is_celpip_easier_than_ielts/,Is CELPIP easier than IELTS?,"**Before I answer the question ""Is CELPIP easier?"", let me tell you what I have seen.**

  
  
In IELTS, I have seen so many students scoring 9 in Listening, 8+ in Reading, and even 8 in Speaking. But guess what? They fail to score a 7 in Writing. I have seen students take the test 6 or 7 times and still fail to get that 7. They are stuck at 6.5 forever. 

  
Many students choose another path for PR. They apply for a student visa, thinking it will be easier once they study in Canada. However, with the CRS score now around 540, it has almost become necessary to score **Triple 7 and 8** in IELTS.

Because of this, many students are now choosing **CELPIP instead of IELTS**.

Why?  
In this article, I will explain the reasons and how CELPIP can be easier for some students. It is not ""easy,"" but scoring a 9 is much more achievable.



**1. The Spell Check is a Life Saver**

This is the biggest difference.

* **IELTS:** You are on your own. If you spell ""environment"" wrong, you lose marks.
* **CELPIP:** There is an automatic spell checker. If you make a typo, you see a red line and can fix it. This lets you focus on your ideas, not your spelling.

**2. The Writing Task is Much Simpler**

In CELPIP, the second writing task is just an **""Opinion Survey.""**

* You simply choose an option and explain why you prefer it.
* You get about **27 minutes** to write **150 words**.
* This is plenty of time to write and check your work comfortably.
*  You just need to brainstorm about the topic in the given context. However, in IELTS, if you do not know about the topic,  you won't be able to write a 7 -Band essay. For example, Animal Testing. You may say it is not ehtical or may support it  by giving argumets such as there are not alternate options, but write a 7-band essay that convinces examiner that you have suffiicently addressed the prompt will be atough thing

**3. Speaking Strategies Actually Work**

In IELTS, the examiner can ask you random questions that might surprise you. In CELPIP, the questions follow a strict pattern (like ""Give Advice"", ""Sharing Experience"" , ""Describe a Picture"" and so on). Because the pattern is always the same, you can learn **templates** and strategies that actually help you score high.

**4. The Listening Accent is Easier**

* **IELTS:** Often uses British or Australian accents that can be fast or hard to understand.
* **CELPIP:** Uses a standard **Canadian accent**. It sounds like a normal conversation you would hear at a grocery store or coffee shop in Toronto or Vancouver.

**5. Marking Feels More Lenient**

This is just my personal experience, but the marking felt fairer. After being stuck at 6.5 in IELTS writing for a long time, I finally got the score I needed in CELPIP. It felt like the examiners were looking for reasons to give me points, not take them away.

**6. Speaking to a Computer vs. A Person**

* **IELTS:** You sit face-to-face with an examiner. This can be very stressful and make you freeze up.
* **CELPIP:** You wear a headset and speak to a computer. There is a timer on the screen, so you know exactly when to stop. It is much more relaxed.





**Now the question is: If it is easier, then why students are not scoring 9 on their first attempt.**

* The first reason is experimentation. Many students who join my one-on-one classes say they took the exam just to “check how it works,” without proper preparation.
* The second reason is YouTube. Students practice listening on YouTube, which is fine, but what about Reading? You cannot take a proper reading test on YouTube or from random PDF files.
* Many students also avoid proper training because they assume CELPIP is easy. Yes, it can be easier, but a teacher can help you learn faster, avoid mistakes, and use strategies that actually work. Instead of that, students just watch videos and download PDF notes. But in  videos, I can only teach general tips — and those may not apply to everyone.

# 

**If you are stuck at 6.5 in IELTS writing, do not keep taking the same test. Switch to CELPIP. It is friendlier for people who are comfortable with computers, and with the right preparation, a score of 9 is definitely possible.**",1,1764764589.0,CELPIP_Help,0,1.0,False

I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2021. Every year since then, I feel like my physical health and my ability to stay motivated and productive have gradually gotten worse. I also deal with recurring bouts of depression.

I was originally on the Aristada injection, but while I was working full time I had a mini relapse, so my psychiatrist switched me to the Invega injection. It’s definitely stronger, and I haven’t had any relapses since. My psychotic symptoms are well managed now — but I have a lot of anhedonia and very low motivation.

To get through the day, I drink tons of caffeine just to stay awake and focused, and I smoke cigarettes to elevate my mood. Early on after my diagnosis, I was taking Vraylar with Adderall. Back then, I could easily work 6 days a week, but I eventually relapsed. I’m not sure if it was because I was on antipsychotic pills instead of an injection, or because of the Adderall.

Right now I’m at a loss. I can’t get anything done, and I’m constantly tired during the day even after caffeine. I’d really like to reduce my energy drink/coffee intake and I’m considering going back on Adderall under very close supervision. I’ve tried Wellbutrin — it helped a bit but wasn’t perfect — and I also tried Auvelity, which just made me dizzy and exhausted.

I’m hoping to hear people’s personal experiences with using ADHD stimulant medication to treat low motivation or anhedonia while on antipsychotics. How did it affect you? Did it help at all? I want to gather some real experiences to discuss with my psychiatrist as I try to figure out a treatment plan.

1pd2kke,https://www.reddit.com/r/SECFilingsAI/comments/1pd2kke/aspire_biopharma_holdings_inc_initial_public/,"Aspire Biopharma Holdings, Inc. Initial Public Offering Released - Here’s What You Should Know","**Aspire Biopharma Holdings, Inc. – Investor Summary**

**Business Overview**
- Aspire is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical and supplements company developing drugs and nutraceuticals, with an initial focus on high-dose sublingual aspirin products, and working formulations for melatonin, vitamins D/E/K, ED medication, and caffeine products.
- The company depends on third-party contract manufacturers and has not yet established sales or product distribution infrastructure for its core products.

**Recent Developments**
- In early 2025, Aspire completed a reverse acquisition with PowerUp Acquisition Corp., migrated to Delaware, and became publicly listed on Nasdaq under “ASBP.”
- The company entered into several financing agreements, including an Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) with Arena Business Solutions Global SPC II, Ltd, for up to 41,500,000 shares.
- Aspire’s first product revenue occurred in Q3 2025.

**Key Financial Metrics**
- For the nine months ended September 30, 2025:
  - Revenue: $1,941 (all from nutraceutical product sales; $1,901 U.S., $40 Canada).
  - Gross Profit: $884.
  - Operating Expenses: $17.5 million ($15.98M G&A, $823,879 R&D, $696,639 Sales/Marketing).
  - Net Loss: $(19.77) million (vs. $(544,162) in 2024 nine months).
  - Interest Expense: $(2.30) million.
  - Non-cash Stock Compensation: $14.13 million.
  - Cash Used in Operating Activities: $(3.99) million.
  - Cash Provided by Financing Activities: $5.94 million.

- As of September 30, 2025 (unaudited):
  - Cash: $1.95 million.
  - Total Assets: $2.4 million.
  - Total Liabilities: $13.87 million (primarily payables, related party notes, promissory notes, convertible notes, derivative liabilities).
  - Accumulated Deficit: $(22.55) million.
  - Shareholders’ Deficit: $(11.47) million.

**Financing and Liquidity**
- Aspire is heavily reliant on capital from financings. Recent convertible note conversions reduced the outstanding balance: $1,631,661 and $5,260,571 of notes were converted into 9.9 million and 48.1 million shares, respectively, in October and November 2025.
- The ELOC allows for ongoing share purchases by Arena at 96% of VWAP, potentially diluting existing shareholders.
- The company has a continuing cash burn and negative working capital. There is substantial doubt as to Aspire’s ability to continue as a going concern without additional funding.

**Capital Structure and Ownership**
- 138,446,102 common shares outstanding as of December 1, 2025.
- Up to 41,500,000 shares may be resold under the current resale registration (23.06% of shares pre-offering).
- Largest beneficial owner: Kraig Higginson (CEO), with 10,531,193 shares (7.6%).
- Substantial stockholder dilution occurred and may continue from ongoing conversions and the ELOC.

**Intellectual Property**
- Core patents for aspirin formulations have expired; one international application is pending (PCT/US2024/022318, filed March 2024).
- Key trademarks are pending (e.g., INSTAPRIN, BUZZ BOMB, COFFEE SHOT), but no current enforceable patents.

**Operations / Product Development**
- No products have regulatory approval.
- Lead candidate, high-dose sublingual aspirin, is undergoing regulatory review (pre-IND meeting requested in November 2025).
- Other formulations (melatonin, vitamins, ED, caffeine, anti-nausea) are in development; none have been commercialized.

**Significant Risks**
- Early-stage company with minimal revenue and ongoing large losses.
- Heavily dependent on further capital raises; no committed funding for operations.
- Material weaknesses in internal controls as identified by management.
- Lack of enforceable intellectual property for key technologies.
- No pharmaceutical products have achieved FDA approval.
- Significant competition from established pharmaceutical companies.
- Potential for volatility and continued dilution through ELOC/convertible note issuances.
- Received Nasdaq deficiency notices for not meeting minimum bid price and market value listing requirements.
- Reputational risk related to Instaprin asset’s former management’s criminal conviction.

**Management and Governance**
- Executive team includes CEO/Chairman Kraig Higginson and CFO Ernest J. Scheidemann.
- Compensation: CEO $180,000; CFO $240,000 annual base.
- Board of 5 members; majority independent per Nasdaq rules.

**Conclusion**
Aspire Biopharma is at a high-risk, early commercialization stage, with minimal revenue, high cash burn, stockholder dilution risk, and no FDA-approved products. The company's ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain and is dependent on continued access to capital markets and successful product development and approvals. Investors should carefully consider liquidity, regulatory, operational, and dilution risks before investing.

I have no affiliation with this charity but I visited them years ago and want to support their amazing work. I wanted to share an incredible animal sanctuary in Morocco that deserves more attention: **Jarjeer Mule and Donkey Refuge**. They rescue elderly, injured, and abandoned working donkeys and mules and give them a peaceful, caring home for the rest of their lives.

Jarjeer is located just outside Marrakech and was founded by a retired couple who saw how many working equines were left with nowhere to go once they could no longer work. The sanctuary provides food, shelter, vet care, rehabilitation, and most importantly kindness and dignity.

Many of the animals arrive in heartbreaking condition, but you can truly see the transformation once they’re safe and cared for. Jarjeer also supports the local community by employing nearby villagers and buying feed locally, so the impact goes beyond just the animals.

If you'd like to see what they do, their videos and updates are genuinely heartwarming:

1pd2htb,https://i.redd.it/677hdenycz4g1.jpeg,$OTLY Is Oatly on JAB’s Radar?,"On 2 September, Oatly disclosed that Platin SARL (a Luxembourg based investment vehicle) acquired ~55M ordinary shares (roughly 10% of the company) , with last trade on deep pool end of August which made them to disclose ownership above 5%. 

(Oatly ordinary shares are around 0.6 USD, and they had a ADR ratio adjustment 1:20 in February)… 

Platin itself is not widely known, but the individual behind it is: Oliver Goudet, former Managing Director and current senior advisor at JAB Holding Company. JAB is a major global investor in food & beverage, with a long track record of building and scaling categoryleading brands (Keurig Dr Pepper, JDE Peet’s, Pret A Manger, etc.).

What makes this interesting is JAB’s historical approach to entering sectors:
	•	They often begin with a meaningful minority stake (~10%) to gain visibility and influence.
	•	Over time, they have a pattern of increasing to a strategic/blocking position (15–19.9%), which strengthens governance influence without triggering mandatory takeover thresholds in multiple jurisdictions.

Nothing is announced or guaranteed, but from a purely analytical standpoint, Oatly now fits several elements that historically attracted JAB:
	•	Strong brand equity in a global, expanding category
	•	Margin improvement potential
	•	Clear operational turnaround underway (refinancing debt, first profitable quarter, China unit strategic review) 
	•	Valuation way below industry average , increasing the attractiveness of strategic accumulation

Thesis (purely my personal analysis):
Given public information, Platins stake and the JAB connection appear consistent with the early steps JAB has taken in previous investments.

All a part of the ‘Charleston face lift’- prioritizing high paying luxury visitors and stripping away the charm of the local lowcountry. I fear the nights of playing pool with cheap beer, and the mornings of family breakfast are gone. And for what? So another traveler influencer to post a picture of a $50 dollar meal? Everyone had a story and everyone was there because the coffee was hot and the beer was cold. No putting on airs. It was a staple, a true catch all for everyone here, from deckhands to college students to business men to retirees to local families. It’s a damn shame to see it come to an end.

Honestly, who doesn’t know how to use social media? The trick is not the app… it’s building a brand.

I always tell people:
Start small. Pick a niche. Be consistent. Have even 2–3 friends who repost your content. That alone can change everything.

I remember struggling to get followers for years until I sat down, defined my niche, and stayed consistent. Now I’m at 126,000 followers, I genuinely don’t even know how I got there. These days I gain 100–200 followers daily even when I’m not posting. That’s the power of building a brand, not just having followers.

Big following ≠ strong audience.
Zero niche = zero brand.

Social media pays my bills now. It takes me places I never imagined. I learned it all on my own over the last 5 years, and it turned into a real career for me.

I always encourage people: monetize your platforms. Influence is currency these days.

If anyone here wants to learn the basics, I can help a few people while I’m on Christmas break. I tutor part-time, nothing formal, just buy me coffee and we’re good. We can even do a Zoom session.

1pd2cdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify_growth/comments/1pd2cdg/the_ultimate_shopify_growth_mega_thread/,The Ultimate Shopify Growth Mega Thread,"After analyzing what's working for successful stores in 2025, here's the no-BS guide to building a profitable Shopify business.

**Foundation**

Start with an optimized theme. Most beginners waste time installing 15+ apps to patch together a broken foundation. Pick a quality theme from day one and you'll need far fewer band-aid solutions. The best converting themes share critical characteristics: lightning-fast load speeds (under 3 seconds), mobile-first design, and built-in conversion features.

Design mobile-first or fail. 90% of your traffic is mobile, and 72% of all ecommerce sales come from mobile devices. Strip everything down. No clutter, no fancy popups that ruin the experience. Your product page needs the CTA above the fold, benefits in plain English, and a short demo video or GIF that actually shows the product working.

Speed is a conversion killer. Making your website just one second faster can lead to a 7% rise in conversions. Sites that load within one second have 2.5x higher conversion rates than those loading in five seconds. Google recommends under 2 seconds for ecommerce—aim for under 3 at minimum. Bounce rates nearly triple when load times exceed three seconds.

**Benchmarks**

Average Shopify conversion rate: 1.4% - Most stores sit here or below. If you're in this range, there's massive room for growth.

Good conversion rate: 2.5-3.5% - This puts you above average and in healthy territory.

Top performers: 3.2%+ - The top 20% of Shopify stores. Best-in-class stores hit 4.7%+ with systematic optimization.

Industry variations matter: Fashion and apparel average around 2%, while luxury handbags sit at 0.3%. Know your category's baseline to set realistic targets.

The gap between average (1.4%) and great (3.5%)? That's a 2.5x revenue difference with the same traffic. This is why optimization matters more than just driving more visitors.

**The One-Product Rule**

Your first $1,000 comes from ONE product, not ten. Stop loading your store with 15 random items hoping something sticks. Go all-in on one winner. Build the entire store around it. Make it feel like an actual brand, not a dropshipping warehouse. Once you've got traction, add upsells, bundles, and line extensions.

Why this works: Focus lets you perfect every element—product page copy, images, videos, customer journey. Spreading across 10 products means 10 mediocre experiences. One product means one exceptional experience that converts.

**Trust Signals and Social Proof(Non-Negotiable)**

86% of customers won't purchase without reading reviews first. Social proof isn't optional—it's foundational to your conversion rate.

What works:

Customer reviews with photos/videos: Displaying star ratings and detailed reviews. Almost all customers read reviews before buying.

Real-time purchase notifications: ""Sarah from Austin just bought this"" creates FOMO and validates your store's activity.

Trust badges: Payment security, money-back guarantees, SSL certificates. Display near checkout.

User-generated content: Customer photos on product pages provide proof of reality. Instagram integrations showcase real usage.

Live visitor counts: Showing how many people are viewing a product right now taps into herd behavior.

Implementation: Apps like Judge, Loox, or ProveSource automate review collection and display. Start simple even 5-10 reviews per product dramatically impact trust. Send review requests 7-14 days after delivery when customers have actually used the product.

The psychology: People see 2-3 different reviews on average before making a purchase. Social proof reduces first-purchase friction and builds defensible advantages competitors can't quickly replicate.

**Content That Converts**

AliExpress photos are dead in the water. Order your product and shoot a simple 20-second video. The formula is straightforward: hook in the first 3 seconds, show the problem being solved, end with the result. Raw and authentic beats polished every single time.

Content that actually sells:

* Product in use (not just sitting on white background)
* Before/after demonstrations
* Size comparisons with common objects
* Unboxing that shows packaging quality
* Real customer testimonial videos

Welcome emails have the highest open rates of all marketing emails. Use them wisely with personalized greetings, brand story, and clear next steps.

**Persuasion** 

Countdown timers and fake urgency are played out. Real persuasion stacks benefits and creates genuine need. Show the pain of NOT using your product, then the relief of using it. Simple but devastatingly effective.

**Differentiation is Everything**

You need a hook. If you can't differentiate on product, do it through customer service, free shipping, or something else tangible. Meet your customers where they are:

Teens to young adults (15-21): Create the most relevant social media content on the planet. Make your brand genuinely likeable.

Adults (35-40): Free shipping and duties make the decision easy.

Boomers: Just run solid ads. They're less comparison-focused than you think.

**Traffic and Data Collection**

Can't go big with small traffic. You have to pump up volume. But here's what most people miss: are you collecting emails and phone numbers? Are you actually using them? Your competitors might be spending thousands daily on ads and building lists for years. You need to catch up.

Install Microsoft Clarity and GA4 immediately. Better to have the data than wish you had it later. Watch actual user sessions in Clarity to see where people drop off.

**Metrics**

Ignore CTR and CPM flexes. Focus on what actually shows profitability:

MER: Blended ad spend to revenue

Ad-level ROAS: Know what's working and when to scale

These tell you the truth about your business health.

A/B Testing and Optimization: The Systematic Approach

A/B testing with ad headlines can increase revenue by 12%. When used as lead generation tools, landing pages have a 23% signup rate—higher than all other form types.

**Core Web Vitals to monitor:**

* Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Should be under 2.5 seconds. This measures how fast your largest element loads.
* Interaction to Next Paint (INP): Should be under 200ms. Measures responsiveness to clicks/taps.
* Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Should be under 0.1. Measures visual stability (content shouldn't jump around).

**High-impact test areas:**

Product page: Images, descriptions, CTA button color/copy, trust badges placement

Checkout process: One-page vs multi-step, guest checkout vs forced account, payment method options

Navigation: Dropdown menus vs mega menus, search bar prominence, category organization

Value proposition: Headline variations on homepage, benefit highlighting

Navigation improvements alone can increase conversion rates by 18.5% and reduce bounce rate. Make products findable within 2-3 clicks from anywhere.

Use tools properly: Microsoft Clarity for session recordings and heatmaps (free), Google Analytics 4 for funnel analysis, built-in A/B testing in Shopify or apps like Google Optimize.

**Testing discipline:**

Change one element at a time

Run tests until statistical significance (usually 2-4 weeks minimum)

Test during normal traffic patterns (avoid holiday spikes)

Document everything winners, losers, and learnings

Stop Cycling, Start Testing

Stop burning through offers every few days. Stick with one strong offer for a full month, then test creatives like crazy. Work on increasing AOV. Consistency beats constant pivoting.

The discipline: Most stores fail because they change variables too quickly. Give each major change 30 days minimum. Use that time to optimize around it test different ad creatives, landing page variations, email sequences not the core offer itself.

**Apps**

Every app you add costs conversion, not just money. Your site speed drops. Your checkout gets complex. Your product pages get cluttered with widgets nobody uses.

I've seen stores with 15 apps trying to boost conversion when the apps themselves are killing sales. They add reviews, popups, countdown timers, bundles, upsells. Page load time goes from 1.8 seconds to 4.3 seconds. Bounce rate doubles.

The best converting stores run 3-5 apps max. Everything else gets built into the theme or skipped entirely. Less is almost always more for actual revenue.

The exception: If you had to pick one app, make it a quality bundling app. The free Shopify one is extremely limited. Since you can't fully configure checkout, maximizing product page impact is critical. Show accessories, combos, color options in a way that actually converts.

Retention

Once you find a winner, don't just chase cold traffic. Build email flows that sell bundles, repeat purchases, and accessories. This is how you double lifetime value without spending more on ads.

The ROI on retention: Acquiring a new customer costs 5-25x more than retaining an existing one. Increasing customer retention rates by just 5% can boost profits by 25-95%. Yet most stores spend 80% of their budget chasing new customers.

Critical retention metrics:

Customer Retention Rate: 25-30% is healthy for most DTC brands. Best-in-class brands exceed 40% with strong systems. Some agencies report 62% with personalized experiences and robust after-sales support.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Loyal customers typically spend 67% more by their third purchase.

Repeat Purchase Rate: Track how many customers buy again within 90 days.

Time Between Orders: Know your product's natural replenishment cycle.

Email flows that print money:

Welcome Series (Days 0-7): Highest open rates of any emails. Include brand story, social proof, best products, perhaps a welcome discount. Can significantly increase second purchase probability.  

Post-Purchase Flow (Days 1-30): Thank you, order updates, how-to guides, request review at day 7-14 after delivery, introduce complementary products.  

Abandoned Cart Recovery (1-3 emails over 24-72 hours): 85% of mobile shoppers abandon carts. A well-crafted sequence recovers 10-15% of these.  

Smart Reorder Automation: Pull reorder timelines from your actual order data (serum \~30 days, coffee \~14 days, supplements \~45 days). Trigger flows X days after ""Placed Order"" filtered by product. Start with a reminder email, follow with a bundle or upsell, drop a quick SMS at the exact reorder window. Simple but crushes it.  

Win-Back Campaign (30, 60, 90 days inactive): Include time-sensitive offers or new arrivals based on previous purchases. ""We miss you – here's 15% off.""  

VIP/Loyalty Sequences: Reward repeat customers with early access, exclusive discounts, or special gifts. These people will become your advocates.  

Subscription goldmine: For CPG, health, or pet brands, subscriptions are a retention goldmine. Once someone signs up, they're authorizing repeat purchases. Apps like Recharge or Skio streamline this. Watch for involuntary churn (failed payments)—this can be 13-28% of subscription customers.

Tools that matter: Klaviyo, Omnisend, or Patch for automated flows with deep Shopify integration. They sync customer and order data for proper segmentation and pull revenue attribution to each flow.

AOV Boosting: Post-Purchase Upsells That Work

Post-purchase upsells can increase AOV by 10-30% with near-zero acquisition cost. These offers appear after checkout completion but before the thank you page—customers can accept with one click, no re-entering payment details.

Why post-purchase beats pre-purchase:

Customer has already decided to buy (lower resistance)

Payment info is captured (frictionless acceptance)

No risk of cart abandonment

Can be more aggressive with offers

Strategic upsell rules:

Price sweet spot: Offer products 25-40% of original order value. If customer bought a $60 moisturizer, offer a $20 serum. Too high creates sticker shock, too low signals low quality.

Relevance is everything: Complementary products, not random items. Coffee maker → filters and beans. Laptop → case and mouse.

Upgrade path: Offer premium/enhanced versions of what they just bought.

Smart downsells: If they decline first offer, show a lower-priced alternative immediately.

Apps that convert: AfterSell, ReConvert, or Kaching Post Purchase Upsell. All offer one-click functionality, A/B testing, and targeting rules (minimum order value, specific products, customer tags, UTM parameters).

**Testing framework:**

* Start with 3-5 upsell variations
* Run each for minimum 100 impressions
* Track acceptance rate (15-25% is strong)
* Measure incremental revenue, not just acceptance rate
* Rotate winners, test new challengers monthly

**Create Raving Fans**

You need a handful of people who LOVE your brand. Find customers who order multiple times and send them a special gift. Call them and just say thank you. These people will help you scale faster than any ad campaign.

The referral multiplier: When customers refer friends and receive meaningful rewards, they're more likely to return and stay connected. Apps like ReferralCandy integrate with Shopify and marketing tools, making it easy to set up tiered rewards and track top advocates.

Customer service as growth lever: Fast, helpful customer service builds trust and earns repeat purchases. Integrate tools like Gorgias or Zendesk for live chat and automated workflows. Responding within 2 minutes can be the difference between a sale and a bounce.

**Scaling**

Personalization at scale: AI-driven tools can convert upward of 30% more visitors by showing the best content for each user. McKinsey reports personalized experiences can lift revenue by 5-15%.

Smart search functionality: Site search minimizes abandonment. Include autocomplete suggestions, typo tolerance, and visual search results. Customers who use search are typically more engaged and ready to buy.

Simplified checkout: As many as 85% of mobile shoppers abandon carts. The key to lowering this is ensuring a smooth checkout process. Offer multiple payment methods (credit cards, gift cards, Shop Pay, installment options like Klarna). Autofill customer information fields—faster checkouts equal higher conversions.

Post-purchase account strategy: Don't force account creation before purchase—this drives away 23% of potential customers. Instead, send account creation invites 24 hours after purchase with a 10% discount incentive.

Product bundling for habit formation: Bundling isn't just about increasing AOV—it's about creating habitual purchasing behavior. Show bundles on product pages with ""Frequently Bought Together"" or ""Complete the Look"" sections.

Live chat impact: Implementing live chat to answer in-the-moment questions keeps shoppers on your site and provides information that can direct them toward products they want most.

Checkout customization (Shopify Plus): If you're on Plus, unlock checkout upsells with order bumps and social proof directly in the checkout flow. This is premium real estate for incremental revenue.

**Know Your Strengths**

Segment what you're good at versus what you're not. Many Shopify brands try to do everything themselves and suffer as they scale. Be honest about where you need help and get it.

**When to outsource:**

* Paid ads management (if spending $5K+/month)
* Technical optimizations (if you're not developer-savvy)
* Content creation (if you're not naturally creative)
* Customer service (once you hit 50+ orders/week)

**What to keep in-house:**

* Brand voice and strategy
* Product selection and sourcing
* Key customer relationships
* Core financial decisions

Test everything, measure everything, but start simple.

Curious what works for you - do you stick to the routine on busy days since that's when you need it most, or do you adjust based on what's more realistic?",2,1764763200.0,selfcare,0,1.0,False

Because of this, regular carpet cleaning Brisbane services are essential for families who want a clean, fresh, and healthy living environment. Whether you live in a busy household with kids and pets or simply want your home to look its best, taking care of your carpets is an important part of keeping your home clean.

In Brisbane’s warm and sometimes humid climate, carpets can trap moisture, causing unwanted smells, bacteria growth, and stubborn stains. This makes proper cleaning even more important. In this article, we explore the benefits of carpet cleaning, why steam cleaning is popular, and how to choose the right service for your needs. We will also explain how to find [Affordable carpet cleaning Brisbane](https://austechcarpetcleaning.com.au/services/carpet-cleaning/) services without losing quality.



# Why Carpet Cleaning Matters for Every Home

Many people walk on carpets every day without thinking about what lies beneath the surface. Dust, food crumbs, pet hair, pollen, and tiny particles from outside can slowly build up. Even regular vacuuming cannot remove everything. Over time, your carpet can start to look dull, smell unpleasant, and hold allergens that affect the air you breathe.

This is why many homeowners choose carpet cleaning Brisbane services at least once or twice a year. Professional cleaning helps remove hidden dirt and bacteria that regular vacuuming cannot reach. Clean carpets can improve indoor air quality, make your home smell fresher, and extend the life of your carpet, saving you money in the long run.



# The Power of Carpet Steam Cleaning

One of the most effective ways to clean carpets is through [carpet steam cleaning Brisbane](https://austechcarpetcleaning.com.au/services/carpet-cleaning/). This method uses hot water or steam to break down dirt deeply trapped in the carpet fibers. The heat helps kill bacteria, dust mites, mold spores, and other harmful microorganisms.



Benefits of steam cleaning include:

**1. Deep Cleaning Power**



Steam reaches deep into the carpet layers, removing dirt that has been stuck for months or even years.



**2. Safe for Families and Pets**



Most steam cleaning methods use hot water instead of strong chemicals, making it a safer option for children and pets.



**3. Great for allergy sufferers**



Carpets can trap allergens from the air. Steam cleaning removes these particles, making it easier for people with asthma or allergies to breathe.



**4. Effective on tough stains**



Whether it’s food spills, pet accidents, or muddy footprints, steam cleaning can lift tough stains and restore the look of your carpet.



**5. Leaves Carpets Looking New**



After steam cleaning, carpets usually look brighter, feel softer, and smell fresher.



It’s no surprise that carpet steam cleaning Brisbane is one of the most requested services for both homes and businesses.



# Why You Should Choose Professional Carpet Cleaners

While it may look easy to rent a carpet machine and clean the carpet yourself, the results are often very different from hiring professional carpet cleaning Brisbane specialists. Professionals have stronger equipment, deeper knowledge, and better techniques.



Here’s why hiring experts is worth it:

**1. Better Results with Advanced Tools**



Professional machines provide more suction and deeper cleaning than rental equipment. This means your carpet dries faster and stays cleaner for longer.



**2. Knowledge of Carpet Types**



Every carpet is different. Professionals know which methods and products work best for wool, synthetic, or blended carpets.



**3. Safe and Eco-Friendly Products**



Most professionals use gentle, eco-friendly solutions that are safe for your family, pets, and the environment.



**4. Experience with Difficult Stains**



Wine spills, ink marks, pet urine, and coffee stains can be very tough to remove. Experienced cleaners know the best techniques to treat them without damaging the carpet.



**5. Saves You Time and Effort**



Cleaning carpets yourself can take hours—and still may not look as good. Hiring experts allows you to relax while they do the hard work.



Choosing professional carpet cleaning Brisbane services ensures your carpet receives proper care, giving you the best value for your money.



# Finding Affordable Carpet Cleaning in Brisbane

Many people assume professional cleaning is expensive, but there are plenty of Affordable carpet cleaning Brisbane options available. You do not need to spend a lot to get high-quality service.



# Tips for finding affordable services include:



* Compare prices from trusted local companies
* Look for packages such as whole-house deals or multi-room discounts
* Check online reviews to make sure the service is reliable
* Choose regular cleaning to prevent costly deep cleaning later
* Ask about eco-friendly options that cost less but still work well



Affordable does not mean cheap or low-quality. It simply means finding good service at a fair price.



# Final Thoughts

Clean carpets make your home look beautiful, feel comfortable, and stay healthy. Whether you choose regular cleaning or deep carpet steam cleaning Brisbane, taking care of your carpets is an important part of home maintenance. By selecting professional carpet cleaning Brisbane experts, you ensure your carpets receive the best treatment possible.

And the good news? With many Affordable carpet cleaning Brisbane options, keeping your carpets fresh and spotless doesn’t have to cost a lot. A clean home starts from the ground up—and clean carpets make all the difference.",1,1764762871.0,u_Hackjan_n,0,1.0,False
1pd26ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1pd26ki/my_friend_keeps_changing_plans_and_i_dont_know_if/,My friend keeps changing plans and I don’t know if I’m being too rigid,"I’ve known Rachel through family for eleven years, friends for six. We’re not related to each other but do share a couple of relations.

She’s always had this thing where she will try to get the most she can out of everything (the type to ask for complimentary upgrades and free perks, looking for discounts and hidden membership amenities etc)

The problem began to really show itself a few years ago when we went for dinner and a show with some other friends. 

She got an upgrade, but it wasn’t the one she’d wanted. She was sullen the entire evening, bitterly complaining while the rest of us had a good time, and actually complained to the waitstaff hoping for a discount on the bill. Afterwards we tried to placate her and her response was “it was nice… it would have better if XYZ”.

Over the years though it’s creeped into being this overwhelming personality trait, no upgrade was good enough, no free glass of champagne or entrée satisfying enough, no discount worth it. She would actually compare the square footage of hotel rooms to determine which was best, then argue with desk-staff for a discount on the bigger room. 

Truthfully I don’t see her much these days, because at some point this way of being towards businesses/staff started to turn into how she is with her friends.

We’d make plans, she would push for longer trips, more expensive meals, bigger events. When pushed back against she’d usually relent. But then eventually she just stopped showing up for “small stuff” if we didn’t let her escalate everything. 

Eventually everything became “small stuff” if it wasn’t a weekend trip away or a luxury spa and a meal.
 
Then she’d complain she never saw anyone and was never included.

Most recently she invited me for a coffee at her house, I agreed. She then suggested instead we go to a coffee house. Okay fine. Then it was cake and coffee. Then coffee and brunch. Then lunch. Then a whole day out. At which point I snapped and asked what had happened to a coffee in her house. She immediately backtracked and we settled for coffee at a nearby café. 

The entire time there she lamented how nice a day she’d had planned for us and just made it so clear that she felt the coffee was a waste of her time. I responded that her pushiness is why I have become reluctant to spend time with her and she argued that she just “wants to make things special” for the people she loves. Said I ruin things by always denying her attempts to make things “nice”. I said time spent with loved ones should be special enough and cut the outing short.

It’s barely been a month since then and she’s trying to do it again, while making passive aggressive “jokey” comments about “oh sorry to change things again haha I know you hate me for it but this will be worth it”. When I put my foot down this time she just completely stopped responding.

I’m beginning to doubt myself wondering if I’m just too stubborn about keeping initial plans and she really is trying to do something nice. Now I know I’m autistic I’m not sure if this is a me “not handling changes well” problem or I’m just not understanding a social norm",2,1764762838.0,AutismInWomen,6,1.0,False
1pd26bd,https://i.redd.it/gb5xv85v9z4g1.png,I built a viral app clone in 4 hours using AI tools and zero coding skills - here's my exact workflow,"Just shipped my first mobile app using nothing but AI tools and I'm still shaking. No joke, this took me 4 hours from idea to working prototype.

**Here's the stack that made me feel like a 10x developer:**

🎯 **Step 1: Finding Gold (30 mins)**

* Headed to Sensor Tower and stalked the trending apps
* Found an app blowing up with 500K+ downloads in 2 weeks
* Analyzed what made it addictive (spoiler: simple concept, perfect execution)

🧠 **Step 2: Claude Did the Heavy Lifting (45 mins)**

* Fed Claude the app concept
* Asked it to generate: UI/UX design specifications, complete MVP term sheet, feature breakdown, user flow descriptions
* The output? *Chef's kiss* \- more detailed than my college thesis

🎨 **Step 3: Design Magic (1 hour)**

* Took Claude's specs to Google Stitch (stitch (dot) withgoogle (dot) com)
* This tool is INSANE - it turned my text descriptions into actual UI designs
* Got screens for onboarding, main feed, user profile, settings
* Everything looked like it came from a $10K designer

⚡ **Step 4: Build Time (1.5 hours)**

* Grabbed the designs + Claude's MVP term
* Threw everything into Rork
* The AI literally built the mobile app while I grabbed coffee
* Made a few tweaks and boom - working prototype

**The Hook:** What took dev teams weeks in 2020 now takes ONE PERSON an afternoon in 2025.

**What I learned:**

* You don't need to code anymore, you need to know how to ORCHESTRATE AI tools
* The barrier to entry for app development is officially dead
* Finding the RIGHT idea (via Sensor Tower) is 10x more valuable than coding skills

**Am I going to launch this?** Hell yeah. Already setting up TestFlight.

**Tools used:**

* Sensor Tower (free tier for research)
* Claude AI (for specs/design docs)
* Google Stitch (stitch (dot) withgoogle (dot) com)
* Rork (for the actual build)

============================================================

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Xylish, Hi’too University Agricultural researcher***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: February 25, 2141*

I was worried about Maia, and I had been since yesterday.

She seemed to have something on her mind, but she wouldn’t open up by herself, even though I was sure she had noticed me hinting that I’d realised. I had cleaned up our lounge despite it being her job this week, and I had asked about her day twice and acted like I had forgotten I’d asked already. I had even made her a meal from her Human cookbook with substitutes as close as I could find to the vegetables called for in the recipe.

Normally I wouldn’t push to know what was happening for her, but this time it seemed like she was very bothered by whatever it was. Yesterday, we took the tram back to our small two-bedroom house on the outskirts of the glade, but she had been even quieter than usual. She almost seemed to flinch away from other people that got too close to us.

Something must have happened between us getting to work and leaving it. Maybe it was during her mission, or maybe it was when she was at work in the University. Boshja had been particularly nasty yesterday, so it could well have been his work at play. Whatever it was, I was determined to find out.

“Maia? Would you like some tea?” I asked through her bedroom door after knocking quietly.

“Sure,” the Human replied noncommittally.

My frown deepened, as I’d never heard Maia give anything other than an enthusiastic yes to offers of the beverage. She had to get the tea-leaves imported from a planet a few sectors away, and so it was always a treat for her to settle in for the evening with a cup warming her hands. 

This required drastic action.

After making her cup, I carried the cup back to her door and knocked.

“I have it for you.”

“Coming.”

When the door opened, I creased my eyes and handed her the cup. Before she could retreat back into her room, however, I put a firm hand on the doorframe and moved forward slightly. I could tell that the action made her uncomfortable, and her eyes flicked to the hand suspiciously, but it was necessary.

“I can tell that something is bothering you, Maia,” I said in a gentle tone. “And seeing as we live together, and you are a close friend of mine, I would like to know what it is so that I might help.”

Maia looked at me with a hard stare for a long time, so long that I thought she might be trying to intimidate me with those binocular eyes. She couldn’t of course, I had grown up in the wilderness for too many years for the eyes of a predator to scare me. I merely looked back at her and stayed silent.

Finally, she broke the stare with a sigh, and I allowed her to slip past me on her way to the couch. I followed behind and settled onto the opposite side of the couch, looking at her expectantly.

“Do you ever feel like you’ll never fit in?” She asked without looking up from her tea.

*Ah, it’s that kind of thing.*

“Of course. I’m a nomad living and working in an oasis, and I’m the first person in my family to ever go through University. Even when I visit my family, the path I’ve chosen in life sets me apart from them.”

“I didn’t realise, that makes sense. Why did you choose to study at the University?”

“There has always been scholarships for nomads to learn there, but they were offered with the idea that we would stay and live in the oasis, abandoning our families. The governor when I was young, however, came from a nomad family, and stopped that practice. I was one of the first nomads of the area to take a scholarship that allowed us to use our own knowledge and ways in our studies, and I wanted to show other Diani that we had plenty to offer.”

“I’ve heard the methods that the exterminators use originally come from nomads.”

“They do! I’m glad they keep the old ways alive, even a little.”

A silence unfolded between us for a long few moments. The only sound that I could hear was the low murmur of the radio as the reporter read out the latest headlines, likely about the upcoming election.

“Do you feel like you’ll never fit in here, Maia?” I asked.

“Yeah.”

“I’ve noticed that you’ve not socialised with other humans since coming here, maybe that could help?”

“It wouldn’t.”

Another silence, this time interrupted by Maia sipping her tea. It seemed that this would be like pulling out xyka spines, and despite my fondness for the Human, it was all I could do not to roll my eyes.

“Do you not feel like you fit in with other Humans?”

“I don’t. It’s not a case of feeling like I won’t fit in, I know I don’t, that’s why I came to this fucking planet in the first place.” Maia almost snarled with bitter anger, but she quickly hid her teeth with her cup. “And now, just when I feel like I’ve almost found somewhere I can belong, I have fucking Boshja and Chock breathing down my neck and fixing me with these stares like they know something’s wrong with me.”

“Boshja can go fuck himself,” I immediately said, rankling at the mention of him. “Him *and* those two jash’casm that follow him around.”

“Whoa, I didn’t know you curse!” Maia’s expression lifted with a rare smile and laugh at my outburst, which helped me not to die of embarrassment. “That word didn’t come translate properly, though. They’re *jash’casim*?”

“It’s ‘casm’, not ‘casim’, but you did quite well to pronounce it!” My eyes creased deeper in delight at her attempt. Most people didn’t bother trying to pronounce words that their translator couldn’t parse, regardless of their species, but Maia always tried. “It’s the name of a small mammal in the wilderness that supplements its diet with the manure of the kanx’osurr, what the exterminators call beetles.”

“So you basically called them shit-eaters?” Maia laughed again.

“Yep.” I pulled a holopad left on the ‘coffee table’ Maia bought from a traveler a month ago towards me and searched up images of the mammal I was referring to. “This, this is what they are.”

Maia moved closer to me in order to look at the holopad, and I took the opportunity to look at her a little closer than I had been able to since she began to live with me half a cycle ago. Her ears *were* quite a bit pointier than I had seen on other Humans, and I had always dismissed it as natural variation. However, with the close proximity, I could just make out the telltale scars of radical surgery in the folds of her cartilage.

I held my breath as realisation swept over me.

It wasn’t just that Maia didn’t fit in with other Humans naturally, but she didn’t *want* to fit in with them. My mind boggled with the effort of trying to work out why someone would want to divorce themselves from their own species so completely as to change their very form. Out in the wilderness, you could *only* rely on other nomads, and rejecting that would spell a slow death alone.

I studied Maia closer while allowing my mouth to blather on about different wilderness animals, shamefully taking advantage of Maia’s thirst for knowledge. I could not see any other surgical scars on her face, although the play of light over her skin was admittedly quite fascinating. 

Maia’s furless, hairless, pale skin reflected light in all sorts of interesting ways, and I slowly realised that I had ceased looking for scars altogether.

Her forward-facing eyes were watching with great intensity at the various images and videos I found for her of wilderness ecosystems, and perhaps that was one of the downsides of being a predator species. She couldn’t tell I was staring, and that just made me want to stare even more.

Was I being weird? I probably was.

Maia shifted slightly on the couch, and I was suddenly hyper-aware of our closeness by the way her leg brushed up against my wool. My heart raced in a manner I did not understand, almost like that of fear, and I was overwhelmed with the desire to have her brush against my wool once more.

This was wrong. 

She was my exchange partner, and I shouldn’t be feeling these weird emotions about a person who didn’t even want to be around her own species, let alone any interest in reciprocating… what exactly? 

What was I wanting for her to reciprocate?

I didn’t know, but whatever it was, it was improper for me to continue to be this close after realising how it was effecting me. If she knew, she would probably be unnerved, especially because we live together.

It was moments like this that I wished I had never left the wilderness.

With as normal a movement as I could muster, I stood up from the couch and retrieved the woven bag my parents had sent me from the cupboard. When I returned, Maia had blessedly moved to a less intimate distance on the couch, and I proffered the bag.

“You seemed interested in the ecosystem out there, so I thought you might want to try something from it.” I picked out a bright blue berry from the bag and popped it into my mouth. It was sweet, but still had a slightly salty, savoury taste to it. It reminded me of home, and helped to banish the thoughts that tried to get my attention every time I looked at Maia.

“These are the same colour as…” Maia didn't finish what it reminded her of, instead turning the berry over and over in her hand. “You’re sure I can have this?”

“Yes! I checked its chemical composition, none of it is toxic to Humans.”

“Thanks, Xylish, this means a lot.” Maia looked directly at me and smiled for the second time tonight.

“No problem.”

Later that night, I stared at the ceiling of my bedroom and played the whole interaction on repeat in my own head, not entirely of my own volition.

*Fuck. Why am I like this? This is why I caused so much trouble for my family. I can't seem to help throwing my hearts around.*

I thought about the light on her skin and felt my heart do the weird fear thing again.

*What a disaster. I can never tell her.*

It took a long time to get to sleep.

1pd227s,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1pd227s/former_hr_here_subtle_signs_your_company_is/,Former HR here - subtle signs your company is preparing for layoffs,"I’ve been through 3 rounds of layoffs (twice in HR, once when I was also laid off), and there’s a pattern that emerges before the axe falls. Not trying to create paranoia, but if you’re seeing multiple signs on this list, it might be time to update your resume.

This got long, so I’ve broken it down by timeline and severity. Hopefully this helps someone see what’s coming and prepare accordingly.

EARLY WARNING SIGNS (3-6 months out)

Financial and strategic shifts:

Hiring freeze gets announced, especially if it’s sudden or poorly explained. When companies say “we’re being strategic about growth” out of nowhere, that’s HR-speak for “we’re about to cut costs aggressively.” Pay attention to whether it’s a soft freeze (critical roles only) or hard freeze (literally nobody).

Executives start talking about “efficiency,” “operational excellence,” “doing more with less,” or “rightsizing” in all-hands meetings. Once leadership starts using these phrases repeatedly, start paying attention. They’re preparing employees psychologically for cuts.

The company misses earnings or revenue targets multiple quarters in a row, or leadership keeps revising guidance downward. Public companies especially - check their investor relations page and quarterly calls.

Consultants show up. Specifically McKcKinsey, Bain, Deloitte, or similar firms. They’re not there to make things better for employees - they’re there to identify “redundancies” and provide cover for cuts leadership already wants to make. If you see consultants doing org chart analysis or “efficiency studies,” that’s a massive red flag.

Leadership changes at the top. New CEO, CFO, or COO often means new priorities. New executives frequently want to “make their mark” within the first 100 days, and layoffs are a quick way to cut costs and restructure.

Budget and resource signals:

Training and development budgets disappear. Conference approvals get denied, software licenses don’t get renewed, that certification you wanted gets tabled indefinitely. When companies stop investing in employee development, they’re not planning long-term with current staff.

Discretionary spending freezes. Team outings canceled, holiday parties scaled back or eliminated, small perks disappear. These are the easiest costs to cut first.

Delayed or frozen merit increases and bonuses. If annual raises get “postponed” or bonuses are cut despite decent performance, the company is hoarding cash for something.

Open headcount gets quietly closed. You might not notice a hiring freeze officially, but those three open roles on your team just stop being discussed.

Cultural and messaging changes:

The “we’re a family” messaging intensifies. Ironically, when companies start really pushing the culture stuff hard, it’s often because morale is tanking and they know what’s coming. Authentic culture doesn’t need constant reinforcement.

Town halls become more frequent but less substantive. Leadership is trying to control the narrative and keep people calm, but they’re not actually saying anything meaningful.

Internal communications shift tone. Messages become more formal, more carefully worded, more legal-sounding. This usually means lawyers are reviewing everything.

Real estate and facilities:

Office consolidation starts being discussed. Subleasing space, breaking leases early, or suddenly pushing hybrid/remote work after being office-focused. Real estate is expensive and often the first place companies look to cut.

Facilities staff reductions. If maintenance, security, or reception teams shrink, that’s a leading indicator.

MEDIUM-TERM SIGNS (1-3 months out)

The ones people miss:

Your manager starts acting weird in 1-on-1s. They seem distant, can’t give you clear answers about future projects, or suddenly don’t want to talk about your career development, or they cancel 1-on1s. They often know 4-6 weeks before you do and are terrible at hiding it. Watch for:

- Avoiding eye contact
- Being vague about Q2/Q3 planning
- Not fighting for resources they normally would
- Seeming stressed or checked out

Cross-functional projects get canceled or put on hold indefinitely. If that big initiative involving multiple teams suddenly loses steam, it’s often because leadership knows the teams won’t exist soon.

Reorganizations that don’t make sense. When they shuffle reporting structures or combine teams in weird ways, they’re often preparing for consolidation. The reorg is the setup; the layoff is the follow-through.

Senior people start leaving and aren’t replaced. When your VP quietly exits and the role just disappears or gets absorbed, that’s a restructure preview. Execs often see the writing on the wall before layoffs and jump ship.

The “high performer” narrative shifts. Suddenly everyone’s being evaluated more critically, PIPs increase, and the bar for “meeting expectations” gets higher. They’re building paper trails.

HR and administrative signals:

HR schedules random meetings with employees to “check in.” This can be them gauging morale, but it can also be them identifying who might be problems during layoffs (ie, who might sue or cause issues).

Increased focus on documentation. HR suddenly cares a lot about having everything in writing, attendance records are scrutinized, minor policy violations are documented. They’re building files.

Anonymous surveys about “organizational effectiveness” or “role clarity.” They’re identifying redundancies and overlapping responsibilities.

Operational changes:

Vendors get cut or renegotiated aggressively. If the company is trying to save money everywhere, labor costs are next.

Projects shift from innovation to maintenance. All the exciting new work stops, and teams are just keeping lights on. This suggests they don’t believe in long-term investment right now.

Contractors and temps disappear first. This is always the canary in the coal mine. If contractors are let go en masse, full-time employees are usually 4-8 weeks behind.

Financial desperation moves:

The company takes on debt or seeks additional funding under unfavorable terms. This suggests cash flow problems.

Asset sales. Selling off business units, real estate, IP, or other assets to raise cash.

Delayed payments to vendors. If your company is stretching payables or late on bills, they’re struggling with cash.


IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS (2-4 weeks out)

The “oh shit” tier:

You or your team suddenly gets asked to document all your processes in detail, create runbooks, or do knowledge transfers “for continuity.” They’re preparing for people to be gone and don’t want institutional knowledge walking out the door.

Managers have mysterious meetings that aren’t on the calendar, or meetings that say “leadership sync” with no agenda. Often they’re being told how to “rank” their teams (stack ranking) or getting trained on how to deliver termination news.

HR blocks calendar time that’s marked private across the entire organization on the same day. That’s layoff day. Usually a Wednesday or Thursday.

Managers seem panicked or are suddenly unavailable. They’re either in planning meetings or mentally preparing for what they have to do.

IT or Security starts asking random questions about access, or you notice permissions audits. They’re preparing to revoke access quickly.

Conference rooms get blocked all day with “private” meetings. Those are the termination meetings.

The parking lot has way more cars than usual early in the morning on a random day. Leadership arrives early to prepare and coordinate.

The final 48 hours:

Executives all happen to be “in the office” on the same day when they’re usually remote or traveling. They want to show their faces and deliver messages in person.

Your manager asks for a “quick sync” with no context, or you get a calendar invite for early morning with just “meeting.” That’s often the termination conversation.

You notice coworkers disappearing into conference rooms and not coming back, or leaving with boxes. If it’s happening, it’s happening to multiple people today.

Email access starts acting weird, VPN connections drop, or badge access to certain areas stops working. IT is already starting to shut you down.


WHAT TO DO - ACTION PLAN

Preparation phase (as soon as you see early signs)

Update LinkedIn immediately. Make sure your profile is complete and compelling. Turn on “open to work” privately so recruiters can see it but your company can’t.

Refresh your resume and tailor it for your target roles. Have multiple versions ready for different job types. Get it reviewed by someone who knows your industry.

Document your accomplishments with metrics. Revenue generated, costs saved, projects delivered, teams built. Save this somewhere personal, not company equipment.

Save important files legally. Performance reviews, reference letters, samples of your work (that aren’t confidential), documentation of your achievements. Email them to your personal account or save to personal cloud storage. Do NOT take confidential company information, client data, or proprietary code.

Screenshot or save your LinkedIn recommendations and endorsements. Sometimes people leave and delete their profiles.

Reconnect with your network NOW while you’re employed. It’s easier to get coffee as a “catch up” than as a desperate job seeker. Reach out to old colleagues, mentors, recruiters you’ve worked with.

Financial preparation:

Build emergency fund if possible. Even an extra month of expenses helps.

Understand your benefits. Know your PTO balance, how severance works at your company (if there’s a standard package), what COBRA costs, when your stock vests, and what happens to your 401k.

Reduce expenses where you can. Not to panic level, but maybe hold off on big purchases.

Check if you have any loans against 401k or obligations tied to employment. Some companies require repayment upon termination.

Legal and administrative:

Keep records of everything. If you suspect you’re being targeted unfairly (discrimination, retaliation), document it meticulously with dates and witnesses.

Check your employment contract for non-compete, non-solicitation, and IP assignment clauses. Know what you signed.

Mental preparation:

This is not about your worth. Layoffs are business decisions, usually driven by executive mistakes or market conditions. Even top performers get cut.

Have a plan for how you’ll spend day one after a layoff. Whether it’s updating your resume, going for a run, or calling a friend, having a plan helps you not spiral.

Tell your partner or trusted person what might be coming. Don’t suffer alone or let it blindside your household.

If/when it happens:

Don’t sign anything immediately. You usually have time to review severance agreements. Consider having an employment lawyer review it, especially if it includes non-compete or release clauses.

Negotiate if possible. Severance, extended healthcare, references, job search support, equity vesting. The worst they can say is no, and many companies have wiggle room.

File for unemployment immediately. Even if you get severance, you might be eligible. Don’t leave money on the table.

Ask for a neutral reference or letter of recommendation before you leave. Much easier to get this on day one than six months later.

Understand what’s happening to your benefits. COBRA deadlines, life insurance conversion options, FSA/HSA balances.

Get contact info for colleagues you want to stay in touch with. Once you lose email access, it’s hard to reconnect.

Job search strategy:

Take a day or two to process emotionally. You don’t have to start applying immediately.

Quality over quantity. Targeted applications with customized materials beat spray-and-pray.

Use your network first. Most jobs are filled through referrals. Let people know you’re looking.

Consider contract or freelance work to bridge gaps. It keeps money coming in and shows you stayed active.

Be honest in interviews about the layoff. “Company went through restructuring” or “position was eliminated due to budget cuts” is fine. Most interviewers get it, especially if layoffs were public.

WHAT NOT TO DO

Don’t panic or make it obvious you’re job hunting. Don’t print your resume on the company printer, don’t take recruiting calls at your desk, don’t update LinkedIn with “OPEN TO WORK” publicly while still employed.

Don’t badmouth the company publicly. Even if you’re furious, keep it professional. The industry is smaller than you think.

Don’t stop doing your job. Keep performing until the end. You want good references and you never know what might change.

Don’t burn bridges with your manager. Even if they’re delivering bad news, they’re probably just doing what they were told. Stay professional.

Don’t take things that aren’t yours. Seriously, don’t steal company property, access data you shouldn’t, or do anything that could give them cause for termination instead of layoff. You want that severance and unemployment eligibility.

AFTERMATH - IF YOU SURVIVE THE CUT

Survivor’s guilt is real. It’s okay to feel relieved and also sad for colleagues who were let go.

Your workload is about to increase dramatically. Set boundaries early and document what’s not getting done. Don’t try to do three people’s jobs.

Start looking anyway. Companies that do one round of layoffs often do more. Plus, the culture and workload might not be sustainable.

Support your laid-off colleagues. Write recommendations, make introductions, be a reference. What goes around comes around.",45,1764762440.0,careeradvice,2,1.0,False

1pd216w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pd216w/aita_for_leaving_because_he_wasnt_emotionally_or/,AITA for leaving because he wasn’t emotionally or practically ready for a relationship and expected me to carry all the weight of his unfinished previous marriage?,"I (female,26) used to train karate, and that’s where I met one of the instructors (male,37). He noticed me right away and introduced himself, but I didn’t think much of it at the time. After a few weeks of training, I met his wife, who was also an instructor. As time passed, behind the scenes, as it turned out much later, they had a lot of problems, especially her toxic jealousy toward any woman who wasn’t old or married. 

During that time, I was in a relationship, and I even introduced my boyfriend to the karate world. Instructor's wife really liked him, and after we broke up, she and my ex kept liking and commenting on each other's photos and posts, and kept texting each other. Eventually, he stopped coming to training, when I became single again, she gave me death stares every time I stepped into the dojo.

  
Months later, after the summer break,I returned to karate while seeing someone else casually. I started talking to a coworker—my manager—who was married with a kid. He (male, 36) was living at home, but he kept saying his marriage was over and that he was going to move out. After months of just casually talking, he convinced me to give him a chance, he promised he would move out, file for divorce, sign the papers, everything. (Where I’m from, divorce is a long process: you sign documents, take them to court, wait for a letter back with the date for the first hearing, and if there are kids, shared property, etc., it’s even more complicated and takes even more time.) I told him not to use me as the reason he left and that he needed to do it because he didn’t love her anymore. After months of empty promises, he delivered on none of them. I left, feeling stupid for ignoring the red flags.

  
This whole situation messed me up mentally, so I stopped going to karate. The male karate instructor mentioned at the beginning, noticed something was wrong and asked why I was leaving when he believed I had real potential. I told him I was going through a hard time. He offered to meet up for coffee and talk. We did, and I opened up a little. That’s when he told me his marriage was falling apart too. I felt bad for him. He said he couldn’t even tell his wife he was meeting me because she’d start a huge fight. I didn’t like the situation, but it wasn’t my place to judge. We met again the next week, same place, more coffee. But nothing more than just talking. Then she found out, as someone saw us standing drinking coffee and talking, so she started spreading rumours around town that he was cheating on her with me. She even messaged me on Facebook, but deleted it before I saw what it said. Little did I know that was just the beginning of all the terrible things she'd do to make my life miserable. Soon after that, they decided to get divorced and she moved out. 

He started showing interest in me, but I rejected him because it felt too similar to what I’d just been through. Plus, I was not about to prove all the rumours true.. Months later, he still wasn’t coping well, and we kept meeting as friends. Eventually he confessed his love for me. I said no again because he still had to deal with lawyers, court dates, and finances (basically paying her off), which he’d had by now at least 6/8 months to prepare for. On top of that, they shared a dog with a custody-like arrangement—each of them kept the dog for a month or two and then swapped. This meant they were always seeing each other and always in contact. For context, I don’t keep in touch with any of my exes at all, not even on social media, so this constant connection bothered me.

He kept insisting things would be different and promised he’d make it as easy for me as possible so this wouldn't affect me so eventually, I gave him a chance.

From the moment we got together, nothing changed. He still saw his ex regularly because of the dog. I’m allergic to fur, but I tried to accept it. He apologized constantly for the situation but never changed anything, so the apologies stopped meaning anything. After our first month together, all he talked about was how his wife moved out a year ago and how his divorce was coming up. He had an entire year to prepare emotionally and financially but did nothing. Now he was depressed, lying in bed after work, crying about the divorce, and expecting me to support him through everything.

He even forgot our one-month anniversary. When I asked him what day it was, he had no idea. He asked if it might be in the calendar, and I said, “Well, it might be, there is a chance."" That upset me even more. I gave him the rest of the evening to figure it out, but eventually I had to tell him myself. I didn’t argue or blame—I just said it was sad that he remembered when he got married and his ex’s birthday, but not the day he asked the woman he claimed was “the most important person in his life” to be his. I explained how it made me feel. I didn’t expect anything fancy, just for him to remember and acknowledge it. Even something silly like “We survived a month without killing each other” would’ve meant something. He apologized again, but I could tell I wasn’t a priority. His head was still in his past life.

I realized he wasn’t ready for a new relationship at all, and this was the reason I didn't want to start anything in the first place, I knew that he needed to sort out his emotional and practical responsibilities before dragging someone else into the mess. But be promised me and convinced me that everything will work out and that I wouldn't suffer because of this. I was feeling worse and worse, so I told him I needed to choose myself and walked away. I told him we can still be friends and if he needed any help, I will still be here for him, just not in the way he expected... 3 weeks have gone by and now we don't talk. 

So…

Not advice, just **sharing** what I noticed.

I started having beetroot juice with soaked chia seeds most mornings a couple weeks ago. Honestly didn’t expect much. I mainly wanted something lighter than coffee first thing.

First few days were kind of whatever, and yeah the taste is a bit weird at first. But after a week, I realized my digestion felt better. Less heaviness, less bloating in the mornings.

Energy-wise, it’s not a big boost, but I feel steadier. No quick crash like I sometimes get with coffee. It also keeps me full longer than I expected, which surprised me.

I just soak 1 tbsp chia seeds in water and mix it into beetroot juice. Sometimes I add lemon if I feel like it.

If you’ve ever cursed your dice bag during a late-night TI session, lost track of which d10s were for combat rolls vs. command tokens, or just wanted to slam 10–12 dice for a massive ground invasion without scattering them across the galaxy map… this is for you.

→ [Forge Dice Roller](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marketwebster.dice_roller) (100% free on Android, iOS in development)

Built for speed and clarity at the table — no gimmicks, just reliable rolls for epic space operas.

🔧 Why TI players are switching:  

✅ 1–12 dice at once (d6–d100) — handle fleet battles, planetary landings, or those 10d10 combat pools without drama  

✅ Keep highest / drop lowest — perfect for multi-die combat (keep highest 8, drop lowest for hits, etc.) or command sheet rerolls  

✅ Exploding dice — double-tap any die to re-roll it, or turn on Auto-Explode on max (great for those rare high-stakes rolls like victory checks)  

✅ Per-die colors & labels — make your combat dice red, ground force blue, promissory note reroll green… never mix them up mid-turn  

✅ Presets (examples I actually use):  

   • Fleet combat (8d10 keep highest)  

   • Ground invasion (4d8 + modifiers)  

   • Action card draw (2d6 for random events)  

✅ Instant totals, full roll history, one-tap share for session recaps or Discord AARs  

✅ Works 100% offline — no accounts, no tracking  

✅ Zero banner ads, very rare interstitials (or remove them forever for a coffee)

Most of the features people love came straight from subreddit feedback (including epic TI groups), so if something’s still missing for TI4, Prophecy of Kings, or your house rules, let me know and I will try to add it to the app.

The OG Angels Share is so good that even the auto driver asked me what I'm wearing.

Coming to the comparisons:

Kamrah does really well, but the OG Angels Share is so nuclear on my skin that I didn't get the same intensity from Kamrah. Otherwise, they came pretty close to the DNA.

Kamrah Qahwa deserves to be a flanker in the OG lineup, not in the clone lineup. The scent profile is so good that they took Angels Share and added coffee nuances from Mancera Amore Cafe(one of my favorite scents)and created a complete new beast out of it. I personally like it more than all the Angels Share inspirations, including the OG.

Royal Blend Nero fixed what Kamrah lacked: performance. Keep an eye on the number of sprays when you go out; you might choke people in closed spaces.

Sharaf Blend surprised me after reading so much about it. The sweetness really impressed me, and it's even sweeter than the OG while projecting well too.

Lattafa Kamrah Dukaan is my least favorite. My nose couldn't tell much difference besides the spicy opening. Maybe the Angels Share DNA shouldn't be mixed with spices. They added coffee to the OG and made Qahwa, which was a hit, but this attempt is a fail.

Angels Share Paradis costed me 9K(INR) for a 20ml decant, which is too expensive. But it's really good. I love the initial tart raspberry blast in TF Tuscan Leather Intense, and you get the same vibe here on a slightly less sweet Angels Share DNA. This one is nuclear, it lasts the whole day and projects really well. If not for the price, this would have been my favorite of all. Somehow the price point made me not like it as much as the Qahwa.

Rayhaan Valhalla is what I bought so I could spray more of the Paradis DNA for about one-twentieth of the price. I got 100ml for around 2K(INR), and trust me, this one is quite close to the Paradis DNA with the same raspberry opening and projection. It has slightly sharper edges compared to the OG, but for the 2K price point, this one is gold.

For value:
Qahwa > Royal Blend Nero > Valhalla > Sharaf Blend > OG > OG Paradis

Or when I get a seat on the MRT during peak hour out of nowhere it’s such a normal thing, but on a rough day it feels like winning a mini lottery.
Sometimes it’s the warm smell of kopi or toast when I pass by a coffee shop early in the morning. That smell reminds me of slower, easier days, and it softens whatever stress I’m carrying. Or even just hearing little kids laughing downstairs, it snaps me out of my head for a moment and makes me feel like the world isn’t as heavy as I’m making it.

1pd1o00,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1pd1o00/similar_sleep_issues_anyone_insomnia_and_daytime/,"Similar sleep issues, anyone? Insomnia and daytime drowsiness?","I've always had sleep issues, insomnia at night time and feeling drowsy during the day. To preface I have CFS/ME diagnosed, but now my doctor wants me to do a sleep study. So gradually I've quit sleep meds that could cause drowsiness during the day and I've noticed.. exactly zero affect.

Which has made me reflect and remember how throughout my teenage/early adulthood life I would always be tired no matter what, always late for school, always taking naps. I thought I was depressed, which at points we all have been, but even outside of depression I would never feel fully awake.

Towards the nighttime I would mostly always get insomnia, if I tried to go to sleep before 12am I was always guaranteed to wake up throughout the night every couple of hours from different dreams/nightmares. (Which, my dreams have always been very vivid almost like watching a movie, only if they weren't majority nightmares/I used to talk in my sleep or so my dad said apparently within a few hours of falling asleep/I've also sleepwalked at some points when I was younger)

I'm slowly beginning to realise that despite all my implemented efforts in regards to sleep, it just never works. When I was younger I would try and do the ""stay awake until night so that you'll fall asleep early and reset your sleep cycle"", but there was nothing to reset to and I would always end up involuntarily falling asleep during those attempts to find myself sleeping 24 hours and waking up in the middle of the day.

I feel incredibly disappointed realising this has genuinely been my life for almost 2 decades, never awake, but never truly sleeping.

Today I woke up to a sleep paralysis to top it all off. I already feel like I am fighting to stay awake and thinking whether I should take a nap (I've been awake for around 2 hours at the point of me writing this). I woke up several times throughout the night as well.  
I can't remember a time where I woke up ""refreshed"". I have done most everything to help with my sleep (well except the sleep study).

I feel like I've blamed myself for this for the longest time, I remember doctors screaming at me when I was younger to stop taking naps or another doctor saying I was just subconsciously avoiding life by being sleepy. Which I believed at the time since I had 100% trust in them to know my body better than I did, even though the only thing I loved to do was learn and do new things. Now I sort of regret trusting these doctors, one even drummed his chest with saying he could fix my fatigue with a simple protocol.

I've tried asking for help for the sleep paralysis and got the ""just sleep on your side"" which also didn't work.

I feel like I've been waiting to feel awake for the majority of my life. If this is part of having ME that is ""fine"", but this isn't and hasn't been going away at any point in my life despite my level of happiness with my life. The only time I've felt mildly awake was with vyvanse for adhd.

It's also sort of tragicomic to realise that even if I cut out my naps, it still wouldn't affect my insomnia at all, all I ended up doing was fighting to stay awake the whole day and still not being able to sleep at night. Having or cutting out coffee had the same effect. Sleep hygiene, same effect.

I dont understand how you can have none of the more basic things working in your favour and still be disregarded since childhood/teenage years for any issues.

The lyrics from the MGM ""little dark age"" have sort of haunted me with the ""Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away"", because no matter how much or hard I've tried to run or hide from these issues always finding another thing to try, the reality of my situation has never truly changed.",1,1764761131.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

68% thumbstop rate. My video was STOPPING people mid-scroll. 

The hook was perfect. A hand reaching for a supplement bottle in slow motion with the text ""What doctors don't tell you about -""

***Meta loved it. I loved it.*** My designer loved it.

CTR: 6.2%. Amazing.

CPM: $14. Reasonable.

Add-to-cart rate: 11%. Incredible.

**Purchase rate: 0.9%.**

Wait, what?

I spent $8,400 testing variations of this ad over 18 days. 

Changed the headline.   
Changed the offer.   
Changed the CTA button color.   
Changed the landing page.

Nothing worked.

Then I did something most people never do: I watched the video frame-by-frame like a psychopath analyzing the Zapruder film.

And there it was. **0.8 seconds into the video.**

The exact moment everyone swiped away.

# The problem wasn't the hook. It was what happened immediately after.

My video went:

**0.0s:** Hook (hand reaching) ← 68% of people stopped here  
**0.8s:** Logo animation (2 seconds) ← Everyone left here  
**2.8s:** Product benefit (""Boost energy naturally"")  
**5.0s:** Social proof (""10,000+ customers"")  
**8.0s:** Offer (""30% off today"")

You see the problem?

People stopped at 0.8 seconds. Waited through a logo animation. Never saw the actual benefit.

I thought the hook WAS the benefit. It wasn't. The hook was just a pattern interrupt.

**The hook stops the scroll. The value prop stops the swipe.**

And I was showing my value prop at 2.8 seconds. Most people were gone by 1.2 seconds.

# So I rebuilt the video with scientific precision (and mild obsession)

New structure:

**0.0s:** Hook (same hand reaching)  
**0.4s:** Value prop text overlay: ""3X more energy than coffee, no crash""  
**1.8s:** Product visual  
**3.2s:** Social proof  
**5.5s:** Offer

Same hook. Same everything else. Just moved the value prop to 0.4 seconds.

**Results:**

* Thumbstop rate: 66% (slightly lower, fine)
* CTR: 5.8% (slightly lower, fine)
* Add-to-cart rate: 10.8% (basically same)
* **Purchase rate: 3.4%** (3.7x increase)
* ROAS: Went from 1.2x (losing money) to 4.1x (very profitable)

Same ad. Timing changed by 2.4 seconds. $8,400 in wasted spend could have been avoided.

# Then I got obsessive and tested 200+ ads frame-by-frame

I analyzed every video ad I'd run over 9 months. 216 ads total. Mapped exactly when people dropped off.

Here's what I found that nobody talks about:

**But before we talk about it; hear me out for a second.**

Yes I obsess over the Hooks like a nerd

Even we build-

A database of 10,000+ Hooks for internal use but if you need it I can share the access (it's free)

https://i.redd.it/9ucuwwjb4z4g1.gif

Let me know in the comments I'll sent it over.

Ohh, I'll also send- ***2,000+ High Performing Meta Ads Database***

https://i.redd.it/5v6v65mf4z4g1.gif

Now let's get back to the topic.

# Discovery #1: There are three ""drop-off cliffs"" in every video ad

**Cliff #1: The Logo Trap (0.5-1.5 seconds)**

Most people put their logo at 0.5-1.0 seconds. ""Branding,"" they say.

I tested 47 ads with logo at 0.8s vs 47 ads with logo at 5.0s.

Logo at 0.8s: Average 34% drop-off before value prop  
Logo at 5.0s: Average 12% drop-off before value prop

**Your logo is not a value prop.** People don't care about your brand when they don't know what you sell yet.

Exception: You're Nike or Apple. You're not. Put your logo at the end.

# Discovery #2: The ""3-Second Gap of Death""

If your value prop doesn't appear within 3 seconds of the hook, you lose 60-70% of viewers.

I mapped 216 ads:

* Value prop at 0-1s: 8-12% viewer drop-off
* Value prop at 1-2s: 15-23% drop-off
* Value prop at 2-3s: 31-42% drop-off
* Value prop at 3-4s: 58-71% drop-off
* Value prop at 4-5s: You're advertising to ghosts

There's a reason TikTok ads that convert say ""This $14 thing from Amazon"" in the first 0.5 seconds. They know.

# Discovery #3: Sound-off viewers drop off 2.1x faster

This one hurt.

I make beautiful videos with music, voiceover, sound effects. Real production value.

85% of people watch with sound OFF.

For sound-off viewers:

* If value prop isn't visible TEXT on screen by 1.0s: 67% gone
* If value prop is in voiceover only: 82% gone by 2.0s
* If you rely on audio for context: You're making radio ads for deaf people

My best-performing videos now have:

* Text overlay at 0.4s with the benefit
* Text overlay at 1.8s with the proof point
* Text overlay at 3.5s with the offer
* Voiceover that REPEATS the text (for the 15% with sound on)

Redundant? Yes. Effective? Also yes.

# The part where I reverse-engineered 500 competitor videos

I wasn't satisfied. So I analyzed 500 videos from competitors and brands in my niche.

Mapped frame-by-frame when they showed:

1. Hook (pattern interrupt)
2. Value prop (what's in it for me)
3. Proof (why should I believe you)
4. Product (what am I actually buying)
5. Offer (why should I buy now)

Here's what the top performers do differently:

# Top 20% of ads (ROAS 3.5x+):

**0.0-0.5s:** Hook  
**0.5-1.5s:** Value prop (text overlay, visible immediately)  
**1.5-3.0s:** Proof (social proof, testimonial, or result)  
**3.0-4.5s:** Product showcase  
**4.5-6.0s:** Offer (discount, urgency, scarcity)

Average video length: 6-9 seconds

# Bottom 20% of ads (ROAS <2.0x):

**0.0-1.0s:** Hook  
**1.0-2.5s:** Logo, branding, b-roll  
**2.5-4.0s:** Product showcase  
**4.0-7.0s:** Value prop (finally)  
**7.0-10.0s:** Offer  
**10.0-15.0s:** More b-roll because ""production value""

Average video length: 12-18 seconds

The losing ads buried the value prop under ""creativity.""

The winning ads front-loaded value and got out of the way.

# Then I found the product category exceptions (this surprised me)

This timing framework works for most products. But not all.

I analyzed ads by product type:

**Supplements/Health (my category):**

* Value prop must hit by 1.0s
* Proof must hit by 2.5s
* Offer by 5.0s
* Why: High skepticism. People need fast proof or they're gone.

**Fashion/Apparel:**

* Hook 0.0-0.5s
* Product showcase 0.5-2.5s (longer than usual)
* Value prop can wait until 2.5-3.5s
* Why: Visual product. People want to SEE it before the pitch.

**Tech/Electronics:**

* Hook 0.0-0.5s
* ""The problem"" 0.5-1.5s (must establish pain point)
* ""The solution"" 1.5-3.0s (how product solves it)
* Proof 3.0-4.5s
* Why: Technical buyers want problem → solution logic flow

**Beauty/Skincare:**

* Hook with before/after tease 0.0-0.5s
* Value prop 0.5-1.2s
* Before/after visual 1.2-4.0s (can be longer)
* Offer 4.0-6.0s
* Why: Transformation sells. The before/after IS the value prop.

**Home/Furniture:**

* Hook (problem scenario) 0.0-0.8s
* Value prop + product in context 0.8-3.0s (longer showcase)
* Social proof 3.0-4.5s
* Offer 4.5-6.0s
* Why: People need to visualize the product in their space.

# The sound-on vs sound-off performance gap (this will make you rethink everything)

Remember how I said 85% watch with sound off?

I tested 30 ads with two versions:

**Version A:** Optimized for sound-off (text overlays at key moments)  
**Version B:** Optimized for sound-on (voiceover-driven, minimal text)

**Version A performance:**

* Sound-off viewers: 3.8% conversion rate
* Sound-on viewers: 3.2% conversion rate
* Average: 3.7% conversion rate

**Version B performance:**

* Sound-off viewers: 1.1% conversion rate
* Sound-on viewers: 4.9% conversion rate
* Average: 1.6% conversion rate

Version B performed BETTER for sound-on viewers but died with sound-off viewers.

Since 85% watch with sound off, Version A won by 2.3x.

**The lesson:** Optimize for the 85%, not the 15%.

Your video should work perfectly with sound OFF. If it also works with sound ON, that's a bonus.

# The ""swipe-up timing"" discovery that nobody talks about

This one's subtle but expensive.

I tracked when people swiped up on my ads (the ""Learn More"" / ""Shop Now"" action).

Most swipes happen at these moments:

**First swipe window: 2.5-3.5 seconds**

* People have seen hook + value prop + some proof
* They're curious enough to check it out
* This is your BEST swipe window for quality traffic

**Second swipe window: 5.5-6.5 seconds**

* People have seen the full pitch including offer
* They're more convinced but more skeptical (saw the price/discount)
* Higher intent but lower volume

**Third swipe window: 8.0-10.0 seconds**

* Only the most patient viewers
* Often the highest intent (they watched everything)
* Very low volume (most people gone by now)

My mistake: I was showing my offer (30% off) at 8 seconds.

Only 12% of people ever saw it.

I moved the offer to 4.5 seconds. Swipe-ups increased 67%.

**Pro tip:** Watch your ad with Meta's ""Swipe Up"" overlay in the preview. See if your offer appears BEFORE most people bounce.

# The hook rate vs conversion rate paradox I can't explain

Here's something weird I found:

My BEST hooks (70%+ thumbstop rate) often had WORSE conversion rates than my ""okay"" hooks (50-60% thumbstop).

Example:

**Hook A:** ""Doctors HATE this supplement""  
Thumbstop: 71%  
CTR: 7.2%  
Conversion rate: 1.8%  
ROAS: 2.1x

**Hook B:** ""Why your multivitamin doesn't work""  
Thumbstop: 54%  
CTR: 4.8%  
Conversion rate: 4.2%  
ROAS: 4.8x

Hook A got more attention. Hook B got more sales.

Why?

Hook A attracted curiosity-seekers. ""Doctors hate this"" is clickbait. People who click clickbait browse and leave.

Hook B attracted problem-solvers. ""Your multivitamin doesn't work"" speaks to someone already using multivitamins (my target customer).

**The best hooks aren't the most attention-grabbing. They're the most RELEVANT.**

A 50% thumbstop rate from your exact target audience beats a 70% thumbstop rate from random curiosity-seekers.

# What I do differently now

Every video ad I make follows this checklist:

**0.0-0.5s:** Hook that targets my specific customer (not generic curiosity)  
**0.5-1.5s:** Value prop as text overlay (visible to sound-off viewers)  
**1.5-3.0s:** Proof point (social proof, testimonial, or stat)  
**3.0-4.5s:** Product showcase (what they're actually buying)  
**4.5-6.0s:** Offer (discount, urgency, why buy now)  
**6.0s+:** Optional extended content for the patient few

Total video length: 6-8 seconds for most products.

I also:

* Put logo at the END (5.5s+), not the beginning
* Assume 85% watch with sound off
* Test text overlay placement at 0.4s, 1.8s, and 4.2s
* Show offer before 5.0s (when most people are still watching)
* Track drop-off by second (not just overall completion rate)

And the biggest change: **I watch every ad frame-by-frame before launching.**

If the value prop isn't visible by 1.0s, I don't run it.

# The $8,400 lesson

I could've avoided all of this with one simple test: Watch my ad on mute and ask ""Do I know what this product does within 1 second?""

For my original ad: No. I saw a hand reaching, then a logo, then... I got bored and swiped away.

For my new ad: Yes. Text overlay at 0.4s says exactly what it does.

That's the difference between a 1.2x ROAS (losing money) and a 4.1x ROAS (printing money).

Same product. Same hook. Different timing.

0.8 seconds.

1pd1ilb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/1pd1ilb/social_case_in_fes/,Social case in Fes,"Hey everyone,

I want to share a really sad story.

I’m originally from Tunisia but I live in the U.S. now. I have an American friend who became very interested in Islam. He learned everything on his own with no guidance—just him, his books, and his sincerity. He lived in rural North Carolina with his wife and kids, raising chickens and living a simple country life.

But because there were no Muslims around him—and because people in his area viewed Muslims in a very hostile way—he started thinking about leaving everything behind and moving to Morocco. I didn’t give him any strong opinion at the time, because I knew it could turn into a risky adventure.

He met someone online from Fes who began promising him all kinds of unrealistic things: that he’d take care of him and his family when they arrived, help him settle, help him start a business. He told him he could buy a small riad for $5,000 to use as an Airbnb, and claimed he himself had a riad that only needed some restoration. The deal was: if my friend paid for the renovations, he could stay there for free—as long as he also paid all the bills.
A lot of red flags.

He even asked my friend for money while my friend was still in the U.S., before anything was legally documented. I warned him gently not to trust people too easily and not to send money unless everything was done legally and in writing.

But my friend was excited, so he sold his house and everything he owned, and moved to Morocco with his wife, two kids, and three kittens.

At first, it looked promising. The Moroccan guy actually showed up at the airport, picked them up, and helped them settle into an Airbnb in Casablanca. He was friendly, showed them around, and acted supportive.

After a few days, they went to Fes to see his riad. The place was in terrible condition. Still, my friend trusted him and started spending money on renovations—but the Moroccan guy kept no invoices. He would tear them up.

After spending around $15,000, nothing noticeable had improved in the house.

Then things got worse. One day my friend found the Moroccan guy drunk, bringing prostitutes into the house—while his wife and kids were living there. My friend confronted him, and the man became aggressive. So he called the police. They arrested the guy, but at that point my friend realized he had been scammed out of $15,000.

Now he’s completely lost. Not sure whether to stay in Morocco or go back to the U.S. And on top of that, several other people tried to scam him or borrow money that they never returned.

If there’s a kind soul out there who can genuinely help him—without taking advantage of him—it would mean a lot. He wants to start a business, maybe a small restaurant or a coffee shop, but he doesn’t know who to trust anymore.

If anyone is truly willing to help, let me know and I’ll share his contact.",2,1764760626.0,Morocco,10,1.0,False

Been married to my husband for 25 years; last couple of years have been rocky, we’re currently in marriage counseling. Our sex drives are different, mine is lower than his. I have been diagnosed with complex trauma stemming from childhood, OCD and anxiety.
Here’s the situation I need clarification on, this happened this past summer when we were on vacation (visiting family). We talked about it after the fact and my husband said he misunderstood. But for some reason my brain is going back to it. One morning I playfully tried to remove his towel after his shower. I didn’t really want sex but he got aroused and said he’d like a blow job. I didn’t really want to because I was still relaxing in bed and we had talked about walking to a cafe to get a coffee together, and we needed time for this because we were leaving for an activity. But I went along with it anyway. He approached me and I said that he needed to arouse me in some way.  Then I was like, you might as well go inside me, but I didn’t want him to c*m in me. I knew it would be quick for him because it usually is and I haven’t  orgasmed during sex in awhile and it’s really frustrating. So he thr*sts and I’m like “don’t c*m in me”, “he’s like, ok it feels good, and he’s like one more thr*st”, and I’m like, stop, and he thr*sted 2 more times and then pulled out and came outside of me.
My issue is that I had to ask TWICE , he didn’t IMMEDIATELY stop. 
(This all happened after the previous night when we watched a rape scene that was awful. I was so triggered after we watched and that was in my head the next morning.)

Me and my partner have travelled to Sicily many times over the years, it is a very special place to us. When we visited Palermo years ago, we got some coffee from a small grocery store to keep at the Airbnb. I can't remember the name or the brand, but it had a picture of monks on the packet. It was ground coffee for brewing in a Moka pot. Now, every time we go back we pick up the monk coffee for the mornings.

**I know there is better coffee out there**, but this grocery store coffee became a staple of our trip backpacking around, and I'd like to buy a packet for my partner's Christmas present as it will bring back those beautiful memories. I know this might be the equivalent of buying someone a crappy Nescafe, but it will bring back memories of many truly special trips to Sicily over the years. I've had no luck googling.

That basil character was flawed but i didnt hate that writing or character.

Bad girl

A woman who made bad choices and was constantly blaming her parents not herself and finally understands that she needs a space and she understands how her decisions and how her mother was also a victim. It clearly figured out what she wanted.

She had a good friend to guide and she taught her reality. She had a understanding boyfriend in the school who had to make a decision for his family and a bf in the later who was supportive.

She was so flawed that she cheated in the relationship and got into the relationship with a committed guy and  got cheated.  Perfect karma boomerang. She deserved it. I am all for it

When i was seeing it in theatre, i was constantly saying lusu da ava seriyana lusu. she is flawed. Arjun konda character was flawed , i had disgust but it was good writing. 

That's how writing should be.

Animal movie was much better , he was a psycho who had a mindset of an animal and he behaved like it. Title suited, Indha movie ku pseudo feminism or anti feminism nu peru vechurkalam. 

Feminism is a ideology which doesn't have a rulebook. I am trying to understand it. It cant bring all women together for a cause, the causes are numerous and the individual opinions vary. there are individuals who uses this against people for their gain and malign its true purpose. Just like communism. A communist society works only when every one of them are not greedy and selfless. Happens only in utopia.  But i think it helps us question things.

1pd17gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/1pd17gv/quit_getting_food_delivery_cold_turkey/,Quit getting food delivery cold turkey,"I knew our food expenses were high but was floored that it was double my highest guess when I went through our statements and added up every meal delivered, grocery trip, coffee, Costco, and meal out. I absolutely hated doom scrolling to find something that tasted good lukewarm. When all the fees would add up to double the cost of my meal and I still hit the payment button, I’d feel deep shame. 

Then one day I decided I was just going to make and freeze a large batch of rice. If I didn’t feel like cooking, I’d eat eggs and rice. It was more satisfying to eat than I thought it would be. From there, I made two whole boxes of pasta at once to freeze so I’d have another meal in minutes. Over the next four months, I made a large batch of dal, Thai green curry, a batch of pesto, some soups, shepherd’s pie, and lasagna. I now have over a month’s worth of meals in my freezer. 

Every night that dinner takes me less than 5 minutes to make is so satisfying. It’s food that’s healthy, near instant, and hot. Now I have it so I just make a large batch of something once a week. In one month, we’ve spent only 20% of our peak food cost. That 80% savings is mind blowing. 

If you’re wanting to stop spending on food delivery, eat healthier, or more conveniently, start with freezing one small staple like rice or pasta. Reframe dinners in your mind as “eating from the freezer” vs ordering delivery. Get curious about how to make one meal so good that it tastes better than dining out. It makes cooking a lot more fun. Create a rotation of 4-5 of those.

I don’t know how or when I ended up with the expectation that meals should take less than a few minutes to figure out, but I’m glad I now pull from the freezer vs ordering food delivery. 

Edit: Didn’t expect the responses I’ve been getting. For some context, ordering delivery start out as something to do once in a while when days were long and we felt too tired to cook. When most days felt long, it got easier to justify. 

I suppose this post is more for people who fell into the same trap we did. It really just snuck up on us over time. For people feeling decision fatigue and exhausted, ordering delivery can seem like an easy fix. I also wonder how many people commenting negatively don’t have to cook all the meals for their household. ",35,1764759556.0,lifehacks,37,0.68,False
1pd17a6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pd17a6/how_to_stop_friend_escalating_plans/,How to stop friend escalating plans,"I’ve known Rachel through family for eleven years, friends for six. We’re not related to each other but do share a couple of relations.

She’s always had this thing where she will try to get the most she can out of everything (the type to ask for complimentary upgrades and free perks, looking for discounts and hidden membership amenities etc)

Truthfully it didn’t bother me, though it was a bit annoying sometimes if she tried for something and didn’t get it because she would become quite disappointed and would need distracting/cheering up before we could get back to enjoying whatever we were doing. It was fine though, just a weird quirk.

It began to really show itself a few years ago when we went for dinner and a show with some other friends. 

She’d tried for an upgrade, and actually got one, but it wasn’t the one she’d wanted. She was sullen the entire evening, bitterly complaining while the rest of us had a good time, and actually complained to the waitstaff hoping for a discount on the bill, when that didn’t happen she completely checked out of the whole experience and was miserable till we left. Afterwards we tried to placate her and her response was “it was nice… it would have better if XYZ”.

It was put down to a one-off initially because she went back to her usual ways after for a while. Over the years though it’s creeped into being this overwhelming personality trait, no upgrade was good enough, no free glass of champagne or entrée satisfying enough, no discount worth it. She would actually compare the square footage of hotel rooms to determine which was best, then argue with desk-staff for a discount on the bigger room. 

Going out with her became an ordeal, and quite a few times she was told bluntly to stop making such a huge fuss which just made her draw in to herself. 

Truthfully I don’t see her much these days, because at some point this way of being towards businesses/staff started to turn into how she is with her friends.

We’d make plans, she would push for longer trips, more expensive meals, bigger events. When pushed back against she’d usually relent. But then eventually she just stopped showing up for “small stuff” if we didn’t let her escalate everything. 

Eventually everything became “small stuff” if it wasn’t a weekend trip to vegas or a luxury spa and a meal.
 
Then she’d complain she never saw anyone and was never included.

Most recently she invited me for a coffee at her house, I agreed. She then suggested instead we go to a coffee house. Okay fine. Then it was cake and coffee. Then coffee and brunch. Then lunch. Then a whole day out. At which point I snapped and asked what had happened to a coffee in her house. She immediately backtracked and we settled for coffee at a nearby café. 

The entire time there she lamented how nice a day she’d had planned for us and just made it so clear that she felt the coffee was a waste of her time. I responded that her pushiness is why I have become reluctant to spend time with her and she argued that she just “wants to make things special” for the people she loves. Said I ruin things by always denying her attempts to make things “nice”. I said time spent with loved ones should be special enough and cut the outing short.

It’s barely been a month since then and she’s trying to do it again, while making passive aggressive “jokey” comments about “oh sorry to change things again haha I know you hate me for it but this will be worth it”. When I put my foot down this time she just completely stopped responding.

I would say she’s a good person other than this part of her, but it is truthfully becoming a very large part of her. Is there anything I can do here to try and bring her back to where we used to be? I sometimes doubt myself wondering if I’m just too stubborn about initial plans and she really is trying to do something nice. ",1,1764759536.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I just need to put this somewhere that isn’t my head.

For the last week, every time I close my eyes to sleep I see that door. Worse than that, I hear it—not creaking or slamming, but breathing. Like something on the other side is pressing up against it just hard enough to bow the wood.

I know how it sounds. I know what it makes me sound like.

But I can tell you exactly where I was, what trail I took, and when my phone stopped getting a signal. I can show you the photos from before everything went sideways. None of that fixes the part where, if I’m being honest, I have a real, concrete memory gap right where the worst part should be.

I remember walking up to the door.

I remember reaching for the handle.

Everything after that is like a thumb smeared across wet ink.

So I’ll start at the last place I’m sure of, and you can decide if you think a brain can just snap like this on a casual weekend trip.


I was camping alone on purpose.

I don’t mean that in an edgy, “no friends” way. My group of friends from college has a running tradition—at least one big trip a year if we can swing it. Rivers, mountains, desert, whatever we can agree on. Lately, though, everyone’s schedules have gotten shredded by jobs and kids and random disasters. The last three trips died in the group chat forty-eight hours before we were supposed to leave.

I kept catching myself scrolling back through old photos of hikes, seeing stupid grins and muddy boots, and realizing that apparently I’d started needing other people as an excuse to go outside.

So I took three days off and drove into a national forest I’m not going to name. There’s a lake up there you can only hike into. The closest trailhead is down a rutted dirt road, the kind where you spend half the drive wondering if you’re about to bottom out and lose your oil pan, and the other half listening to every new rattle and deciding if that’s “normal car noise” or “you’re about to die.”

I parked at the empty lot around noon. There was one other truck, coated in dust, no one in sight. The air had that sharp pine smell I’ve never found anywhere else—sap and dirt and something cold, even in August.

I signed the trail register at the board: name, number in party (“1”), destination (“Lake”), expected return (“Sunday, before dark”).

I remember pausing with the pen over the paper and thinking: At least if I get eaten by a bear, they’ll have a starting point.

It was a dumb little joke. But I remember it because of what the ranger said later about my handwriting changing.

The hike up to the lake was uneventful in the best way. Four miles of switchbacks, then a long ridge that gave me glimpses of the water through breaks in the trees. There were old, faded blazes on the trunks—white paint, flaking off—but the trail was clear enough and my pack wasn’t trying to kill me for once. I’d packed light: cheap tent, borrowed stove, three granola bars, and one gas-station turkey sandwich I regretted as soon as I ate it.

I set up camp on the north side of the lake. It was a small clearing someone else had clearly used before: half-burned fire ring, a log dragged into a rough bench. The shore was a narrow strip of pebbles, then the water dropped off fast. The opposite side was just a wall of evergreens going straight up, no nice, welcoming beach, just trees and stone.

The first weird thing was how quiet it was.

You get used to a certain forest soundtrack when you hike enough. Wind in the branches, birds arguing about whatever birds argue about, insects, the occasional distant aircraft. This felt… muted. Like someone had turned the volume down a few clicks. Nothing dramatic, just enough that I noticed when I took my pack off and realized I couldn’t hear any birds at all.

I told myself it was the time of day, or the weather, or some natural thing I didn’t know enough about. The sky was clear. No storm brewing. No obvious reason for it.

I made camp. I wrestled with the tent zipper for way too long. I boiled water. I ate freeze-dried chili that tasted like salt and cardboard and regret. I watched the sun slide down behind the ridge and turn the lake into one big, dark mirror.

It wasn’t until after dinner that I saw the other trail.

It wasn’t marked. If anything, it looked like the opposite of a trail—just a place where the undergrowth thinned slightly between two big spruce trees. The gap was straight behind my tent, leading away from the lake into denser forest.

I wouldn’t have looked twice if it weren’t for the ground.

Everywhere else near my camp, the forest floor was the usual chaotic mess: fallen sticks, dead leaves, pine cones, little mounds of moss. Here, though, the soil was packed down. Not in a single line, like deer prints or a human path, but in this wide, flat strip, maybe four feet across, like something heavy had been dragged back and forth over the same route for a long time.

I walked a few steps down that not-quite-trail, just enough to see that it continued beyond the first screen of trees. It ran straight, too. Trails don’t do that out there; they wander around rocks, fallen logs, erosion. This one went like a shot, vanishing into shadow.

The GPS on my phone still had a little juice and a sliver of signal. According to the topo map, there wasn’t supposed to be anything in that direction but increasingly steep hillside.

I remember standing there, holding the phone, and telling myself: You are not going to go stomping off into unknown terrain in the evening, alone, for no reason.

So, obviously, the next morning that’s exactly what I did.

I woke up with that weird, instant awareness like someone had snapped their fingers next to my ear.

The forest was even quieter than before. No breeze, no birds, no insects. The lake might as well have been a slab of black glass. My watch said 7:12 a.m.

I climbed out, stretched, made coffee. The little strip of not-trail was still there, just as straight and wrong-looking as the night before.

I know it’s going to sound like I’m trying to justify a bad decision, but I did think it through. I had a compass, a map, extra water, headlamp, first aid kit. I wasn’t planning to go far. Just follow whatever that packed-down strip was for half an hour, satisfy my curiosity, then come back and fish or read like a normal person.

I told myself I’d be back by 9:00 at the latest.

I remember that number. I remember saying it out loud in that empty clearing, like I was making a promise to someone I couldn’t see.

Then I grabbed my daypack and stepped into the trees.

If you’ve ever bushwhacked off-trail, you know how quickly the world changes.

The light drops out. The ground gets unpredictable. Every step becomes a negotiation with roots and rocks and hidden holes.

This wasn’t like that.

The undergrowth on either side was the usual tangle—ferns, shrubs, fallen branches—but the strip I was walking on stayed bare and smooth. Not perfectly; there were occasional roots to step over, but nothing like the chaos around it. It was like someone had taken a big eraser and dragged it across the forest floor in a ruler-straight line.

I kept checking my compass. The trail… corridor… whatever it was, ran almost exactly due north, up a gradual slope. According to my map, there should’ve been a small ravine cutting across my path about ten minutes in, a seasonal creek bed.

I never saw it.

The ground rose and fell a little, but there was no sign of any water, past or present. The strip just kept going, steady as a hallway.

The further I went, the more wrong the silence felt. Silence isn’t just “nothing.” It feels a certain way. This felt heavy. Thick. After a while, I realized I couldn’t even hear my own footsteps as clearly as I should. The crunch of soil and twigs under my boots sounded like it was coming through a wall.

Every few minutes, I’d stop, turn around, and look back the way I’d come.

The way back always looked… off.

Nothing specific I could point at, just this subtle misalignment. The trees felt closer together. The light looked a little dimmer, like I was staring down a long tunnel. Once, when I turned to look, I had this sudden lurch of vertigo, like the ground had tilted under me, and I had to grab a tree to steady myself.

“What the hell,” I muttered, just to hear my own voice.

The word fell flat in the air. No echo at all. Not even that soft bounce you get between tree trunks.

I checked my watch.

7:40 a.m.

I remember that clearly too, because I told myself I’d go ten more minutes and then turn around, no matter what.

The corridor kinked then, just slightly—a small bend to the left, the first deviation from its rigid straightness. My stomach did something weird when I saw that bend, like it had already decided it didn’t want to know what was around it.

That’s where I saw the door.

If I asked you to picture “a door in the woods,” you’d probably imagine some horror movie thing—rotting wood, rusty handle, dark stain around the frame. Something that screams, in big neon letters, This Is Bad.

This wasn’t like that.

It was a perfectly normal, modern, interior door. White. Six-panel. You could’ve pulled it straight out of a suburban hallway. It stood by itself, no frame, no wall, just planted in the middle of that bare strip of earth like the forest had grown around it and politely left it some space.

There was even a little gap at the bottom where you could see the ground under it, the way you can sometimes see carpet under a closed door in a house.

I stopped so abruptly my pack bumped into my shoulders.

Every part of my brain lit up at once. This is a prank. This is an art project. This is some weird backcountry installation. I looked for, I don’t know, cameras, wires, footprints. Anything.

There was nothing. The packed-down strip ran right up to the door on both sides and continued past it, but thinner, fainter somehow, like a path worn in dust rather than dirt.

I walked around it slowly.

From the side, it still looked like a door—just thinner, like the thickness had been shaved down. From the back, it was the same white panels, the same handle. No hinges either side.

I did three full circles.

Here’s the part I know you won’t believe: every time I circled around, I ended up back where I’d started without feeling myself make that last little turn.

I’d step past what I thought was the “side” and find myself looking at the “front” again. The handle was always on my right. The lake, which should’ve been behind me, felt… absent. Not farther away, not closer. Just like the fact that it existed had been filed under “later” in my head without my permission.

I took a step back and realized my mouth had gone dry.

My heart wasn’t pounding yet. My body hadn’t caught up. But there was a high, thin pressure at the back of my skull, like altitude, except I was nowhere near high enough for that.

My phone said I had no service now. No surprise. The time was 7:49 a.m.

Ten minutes, I thought.

I can turn around now. I can go back to camp and pretend I never saw this.

Instead, I reached out and put my hand on the knob.

It was cool. Not cold, not hot. Just a neutral room-temperature kind of cool, which made no sense out here in the morning air. I could feel the shape of my fingerprints on the metal.

The entire forest seemed to lean in.

That’s what it felt like, anyway. Like the air tightened, like every branch and leaf was paying attention.

My thumb rested on the latch.

The next thing I remember clearly is being on my knees, puking into the dirt.

When I came back to myself, I was three or four feet from the door, braced on one hand, my pack half off my shoulders. The taste of bile burned in my throat. My eyes were streaming.

The door was open about an inch.

Just an inch. The slightest sliver of darkness between the edge and the jamb that shouldn’t have existed, because there was no wall for there to even be a jamb in.

I don’t remember turning the knob. I don’t remember the door moving.

What I do remember is the smell.

Not rot. Not anything dramatic. Just… room air. Stale, faintly dusty, with the ghost of something chemical under it. Like an office that had been shut up for a long time. Dry carpet, old paint, long-dead air conditioning.

A breath of air slid out of that crack and across my face. It was warmer than the morning air, maybe by a degree or two. My skin crawled like I’d just leaned into someone else’s exhale.

“Okay,” I whispered, voice shaking. “Okay, that’s enough.”

I grabbed the edge of the door with my left hand, careful not to let more of whatever was inside out, and pushed it shut.

It moved smoothly. Too smoothly. No creak, no catch. It just swung until it clicked, soft as a whisper, into place.

Everything else came back at once.

Suddenly I could hear my own breathing again, ragged in my ears. I heard a single, solitary bird call somewhere far off, like someone hit unpause on a track. My heart finally realized something was wrong and started hammering.

Every instinct I had screamed at me to run, but I forced myself to walk. I backed away from the door, watching it, until the corridor curved and trees slid between us.

Then I turned and hurried as fast as I could without actually breaking into a sprint.

I told myself I hadn’t gone far. Twenty, twenty-five minutes at most. If I stayed on the packed strip, I’d be back at my camp in no time.

Except the strip wasn’t there anymore.

The ground was just… forest.

Leaf litter. Roots. Moss. No clean, bare line. The trees looked different too, closer together, leaning in strange directions that made my eyes want to slide off them.

I stopped dead, one hand on a trunk.

I turned slowly in a circle.

Behind me: nothing but trees.

In front of me: nothing but trees.

The compass clipped to my pack strap spun half an inch back and forth, like it was thinking about what to do.

You know that prickly feeling you get when you realize you’re lost, even a little bit? Not “I took the wrong turn at the grocery store” lost, but “If I keep making bad decisions, this could become a problem” lost? Multiply that by a hundred and add the memory of an impossible door breathing on you.

I took a few long breaths to keep from hyperventilating. I closed my eyes and tried to picture the way I’d come: up the corridor, slight bend to the left, over that one root, past the deadfall with the split trunk—

Except as I stood there, trying to build the map in my head, the details kept blurring. The deadfall: was it on my left or my right? The root: was it big enough that I had to step high, or had I just noticed it out of the corner of my eye?

I opened my eyes again.

For a second—just a second—I saw the door ten feet in front of me, perfectly centered between two trees.

White panels. Silver knob. Standing alone.

I blinked, and there was nothing there but a patch of bare soil.

I laughed once, short and way too loud, like a bark that surprised even me.

“Nope,” I said. “Nope. Nope nope nope.”

Talking out loud made it real. It also made something else real: the feeling that I was being watched.

The forest was still. No movement in the branches. No sound. But there was a pressure between my shoulder blades, a weight on the back of my neck, like someone was standing just behind me, just outside the line where my peripheral vision could pick them up.

I didn’t turn around.

I picked a direction—south, according to the compass, which was at least holding steady again—and started walking

I wish I could tell you some epic survival saga followed. Days of wandering, building shelters, eating bugs.

What actually happened was much smaller and, somehow, much worse.

I walked.

The forest didn’t change.

The angle of the light shifted a little, but I couldn’t tell if that was the sun or just clouds messing with me. The trees stayed the same kind of trees. The slope under my feet didn’t steepen or flatten. I didn’t cross any streams, though according to my map I should’ve hit that ravine no matter what direction I went long before.

The worst part was the way things repeated.

At one point, I found a fallen log with a peculiar pattern of fungus on it—orange disks in a rough spiral. I noticed it, stepped over it, kept going.

Ten minutes later, I saw the same log again. Same fungus spiral. Same broken branch leaning against it at the same angle, like a prop that had been reset.

I’m not an idiot. I know how easy it is to get turned around in the woods and end up walking in circles. I also know I had been checking my compass and keeping a steady bearing. I hadn’t turned enough to loop back. Not like that.

I started marking trees as I passed them. Little cuts in the bark with the knife on my belt. Clean, diagonal slices.

I walked for what felt like another half hour.

When I saw one of my own marks ahead of me, fresh and wet on the bark, my vision tunneled for a second.

My watch said 7:12 a.m.

That wasn’t possible. I’d checked it. I remembered checking it. Time doesn’t just… go backwards.

I tapped it like an idiot in an old cartoon. The second hand ticked, steady and indifferent.

Somewhere behind me, a hinge creaked.

It was the tiniest sound. So soft I might’ve missed it if everything else hadn’t been so quiet. A little metallic sigh, like a door opening just a crack in a house two rooms away.

I turned, slowly.

There was nothing there.

But the pressure of being watched sharpened, focused. It felt like a finger tracing the line from my eyes to some point in the air a few yards away.

Without realizing I was going to do it, I lifted my hand and mimed turning a knob.

The air in front of me shifted.

That’s the only way I can describe it. A shimmer, like heat above asphalt, except it was cold around me. For a heartbeat, I saw the edge of something flat and white, hanging there between one step and the next.

Then it was gone, and the forest rushed back too close, like I’d been about to step through a doorway that had changed its mind.

I ran then.

I’ll own that. Survival instinct, panic, whatever you want to call it. I shoved my map into my pocket, jammed my compass into my hand, and sprinted in the direction that felt like “away,” branches whipping at my face, roots grabbing at my boots.

The forest changed.

Not gradually. Not like a natural transition from one ecosystem to another. One second I was crashing through thick undergrowth; the next, the ground dropped and I was in the middle of a stand of dead trees, their trunks grey and smooth like bones, no branches until way up high.

My ankle twisted on the slope and I went down hard, skidding on loose soil and old bark. I felt something rip in my shoulder. Dirt filled my mouth.

I lay there, wind knocked out of me, staring up at the thin strip of sky.

All I could hear was my own breathing.

And under that, very faint, like it was coming through a long hallway: a sound like someone trying the handles of a lot of doors all at once.

Little metallic clicks, overlapping.

Clickclickclickclick.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

“Stop,” I whispered. “Please.”

The sound stopped.

I opened my eyes.

I was on the shore of the lake.

The shift was so abrupt I thought for a second I’d passed out and woken up later.

My tent was right there, a few yards away. The fire ring. The stupid log bench.

The trees around the clearing were the right trees again: thick trunks, green needles, familiar patterns of bark. The air smelled like pine and water and old ashes.

My knee throbbed. My shoulder burned. Dry leaves clung to my clothes. I had not imagined running.

I checked my watch with shaking hands.

7:13 a.m.

My first thought was that the watch had broken earlier and just now kicked back on.

Then I looked at the lake.

The light on the water was wrong. Not in an “alien sky” way, just not matching the time. When I’d left camp, the sun had been just clearing the ridge, throwing long shadows. Now the light looked like late morning. Higher, harsher. The angle of the shade under the trees didn’t line up with the numbers on my wrist.

My phone’s screen was black. No amount of button-mashing woke it up, even though I knew I’d charged it fully before I left.

I told myself I’d figure it out later. Hypoglycemia, shock, dehydration. Something with a name.

I half-stumbled to my tent and yanked the zipper open.

My pack was inside, just where I’d left it.

The thing that made me drop to my knees wasn’t anything missing or added.

It was the smell.

My tent smelled like that door.

Stale, faintly dusty, with that same almost-chemical undernote. Not strong. Not like something had been spilled. Just… present, in every fiber of the fabric, in my sleeping bag, in my clothes.

Like this little nylon triangle had been sitting in a closed room for a very long time.

I backed out so fast I almost fell over, caught my heel on a rock, nearly did this stupid half-cartwheel into the fire ring. It would’ve been a perfect camping fail video if anyone had been there to record it.

The forest felt too small now. The sky felt too far.

I don’t remember breaking camp. I know I must have, because when the ranger found me later, my pack was fully loaded, my tent rolled and strapped on top. But my next clear memory is of walking down the main trail with the lake behind me and tears drying on my face, telling myself with each step:

Just get to the car. Just get to the car. Just get to the car.

I didn’t pass anyone on the way down.

The lot was full when I got there.

There were at least eight vehicles, all newer than mine, coated in a more recent layer of dust. The bulletin board had a new laminated sign about fire restrictions that I swear hadn’t been there the day before.

There was a ranger truck too. A guy in uniform was standing by the register, talking to a couple in bright hiking clothes. He looked up when he heard my boots on the gravel, and his expression shifted from bored to something else fast.

“Whoa,” he said, stepping toward me. “You okay, man?”

I opened my mouth to say yes, to lie, but what came out was a raw, cracked sound that made all three of them freeze.

The next few minutes are a blur of questions.

Name. Where had I been. How long had I been up there. Did I have any injuries. Did I know what day it was.

That last one tripped me.

“Friday,” I said, because I’d left on Thursday and planned to be back Sunday, so this had to be Friday.

The ranger’s expression shifted in this small, practiced way that told me he was trying not to spook me.

“It’s Monday,” he said. “You signed in on Thursday and never signed out. We’ve had a SAR team on standby all weekend. I was actually heading up to do a sweep when you walked out.”

I laughed.

I couldn’t help it. It just burst out, and once it started, it didn’t sound like me anymore. Too high, too thin.

They sat me down. They gave me water. They insisted on checking me over. My knees were scraped, my shoulder bruised, my wrist swollen. I had a sunburn I shouldn’t have had time to get.

I kept looking past them at the trailhead, half expecting to see a white door standing between the trees. It never showed.

When the ranger went to fill out the incident form, he asked me to write down what had happened, just the broad strokes. I took the clipboard with a hand that didn’t feel like mine and scrawled something about getting turned around, losing the trail, making camp, finding my way back.

Later, in the emergency room, a nurse would look at that form and then at me and say, “You write with your right hand, right?”

“Yeah,” I said, confused.

“Because this is all left-handed.”

⸻

They kept me for observation until the next day.

Dehydration, they said. Maybe a minor concussion. Exposure. The doctors were careful not to say “hallucination,” but I could feel it in the way they circled certain questions.

No one had a good answer for the time gap. The best theory was that I’d gotten lost, panicked, and blacked out stretches of wandering. That I’d set up some kind of emergency shelter I couldn’t remember, then eventually stumbled back to the lake, packed up, and left.

The ranger who picked me up stopped by my room that evening. He was older than I’d thought at the trailhead, with deep lines around his eyes and a wedding ring that had seen better days.

“You scared us pretty good,” he said, pulling up a chair. “We don’t like having names up on the board without an exit time.”

“I’m sorry,” I said automatically.

He shook his head. “You came back out. That’s what matters.”

He hesitated then, tapping his fingers on his knee, looking like he was arguing with himself.

“Listen,” he said finally. “I’m not supposed to say this kind of thing. Liability, policy, all that. But I’ve been doing this job a long time. Long enough to know when somebody’s just spinning a story to cover their own screw-ups, or because they don’t want a ticket.”

He scratched his jaw, glanced at the doorway, then back at me.

“I don’t get that from you,” he said. “I think you’re… trying to make sense of something that doesn’t fit anywhere.”

I didn’t trust my voice, so I just nodded.

He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper.

“This is a photocopy of the trail register from Thursday,” he said. “I’m not really supposed to hand these out, so do me a favor and don’t wave it around.”

He unfolded it and pointed.

There was my name. My handwriting. The date. Number in party: 1. Destination: Lake.

Expected return: Monday.

The “Sunday, before dark” I remembered writing wasn’t there. In its place, in a squiggly, off-kilter version of my own hand, was a single word:

“Door.”

My mouth went dry in this abrupt, stupid way, like I’d swallowed sand.

“That’s… that’s not mine,” I said, even though I could see that it was.

He shrugged, but it was tight, not casual.

“How long were you planning to stay, originally?” he asked.

“Thursday to Sunday,” I said. “I have work Tuesday.”

“Today is Tuesday,” he said gently.

I could chalk that up to a lot of things.

Stress. Hypothermia. My brain trying to patch itself.

I could chalk up the smell in my tent to some chemical off-gassing from the fabric, intensified by the sun.

I could chalk up the weird quiet in the forest to weather and bad timing.

I could even, if I really stretched, chalk up the impossible, repeating trees and the shifting time to some kind of neurological event. A seizure, maybe. A small stroke. People lose time in all kinds of ways.

I can’t explain what’s been happening with doors since I got home.

The first night back in my apartment, I couldn’t bring myself to close my bedroom door. It sounds stupid written out like this. I’d never been weird about that before. But the idea of shutting it all the way, of having that flat panel of wood between me and the hallway, made my skin crawl.

I left it cracked. Just an inch.

At three in the morning, I woke up because it was fully closed.

I live alone.

I told myself I must have gotten up half-asleep and closed it. That’s normal, right? Sleepwalking, half-dreaming, adjusting things and forgetting. Brains are weird.

The next night, I wedged an old running shoe in the gap so it physically couldn’t swing shut on its own.

I woke to a soft click.

The shoe was on my side of the threshold, pushed back into the room. The door was closed. The knob felt cool under my hand.

I don’t know why I did what I did next. Maybe I was tired of feeling like prey. Maybe some stupid part of me thought if I called its bluff, whatever was happening would stop.

I turned the knob and pulled the door open fast.

The hallway was there.

The cheap runner rug. The scuffed walls. The faint glow from the streetlight bleeding in around the edges of the blinds in the living room.

But for just a heartbeat, in the moment before my eyes adjusted, I smelled pine needles and cold water and that faint, stale room air.

Then it was gone, and the door swung back against the stop with a hollow thud.

I’ve started noticing other things.

Office doors clicking shut behind me when no one else is around.

Elevator doors taking a beat too long to open, the air on the other side just a little warmer than the lobby.

Once, in the grocery store, every freezer door in the frozen aisle fogged over at the same time, and behind the frost I thought I saw a shape lean close, like a face pressed against glass.

I blinked and it was just my reflection, warped by the curve of the plastic. That’s what I decided, anyway. It was easier.

⸻

I know what the rational advice is.

Go see a neurologist. Get a psych eval. Have someone check for leaks in the building, mold, carbon monoxide. Rule out all the real-world monsters before you start inventing new ones.

I’m trying. I really am.

But there’s something I haven’t told anyone offline, because saying it out loud to a doctor means I’ll see that flicker in their eyes, that little note added to my chart.

The ranger kept the original trail register sheet. My copy is just that, a copy. I’ve looked at it a hundred times, trying to convince myself the word “Door” looks different than the rest of the handwriting.

Last night, I pulled it out again.

The letters have changed.

They’re straighter now, neater, like they’ve been practicing. The ink is still grey photocopy ink. That hasn’t changed. But the shape of the D, the curve of the o, the angle of the r—they match my handwriting exactly now. Not the shaky version I saw in the hospital. My regular, everyday writing.

I didn’t scream, but only because I didn’t have any air left. I just sat there with the paper in my hands for a long time and realized my fingers were shaking so hard the edges were crumpling.

Underneath, in smaller letters I swear weren’t there before, is a new line.

“Next time, knock.”

It’s the same faded grey as the rest, like it was always there.

I checked the back of the paper just to make sure it wasn’t bleeding through from something else. It’s blank.

I don’t know what to do with that except write this down here and hope that putting it into words pins it down, keeps it from shifting any further.

If you camp, if you hike, if you go looking for places that most people never see, just… pay attention.

If you find a trail that’s too straight, in a place it shouldn’t be.

If you feel the forest lean in.

If you ever, ever see a perfectly normal door standing by itself between the trees, I want you to remember what I am telling you now:

* Tropical Fruit as a direct export for Construction Materials
* Sugarcane + Water -> Alcohol exported for Fuel
* Coffee Fruits -> Coffee Beans exported for Tools
* Fish -> Meat + Aluminium (imported) -> Food for towns/exported for Goods
* Silver + Copper -> Silver Products exported for Aluminium
* Tobacco -> Cigars exported for Machines

(The fruit and coffee bean exports are not reflected properly in the above images, were changed after the fact)

I've also tried to position the exports in such a way to encourage two way goods transport which may not be entirely realistic (I would assume real world nations would have all imports and exports go through a singular port instead) but I thought could make for more interesting choices for routing or starting industry chains.

Everything is super rough due to (again) being inexperienced with the map creator so no fancy decorations, just some freestyle industries placed to reflect the industry chain locations more 'realistically' (mines near/in hills/mountains, plantations near appropriate(ish) vegetation, factories near appropriate primary resources and population centers, etc) because I think it works better than the random generation of industries.

1pd13kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/hubproducts/comments/1pd13kp/shoe_cleaner_kit_vs_vacuum_cleaner_for_shoes/,Shoe cleaner kit vs vacuum cleaner for shoes: which wins?,"Your shoes take a beating every day. Dirt, mud, scuffs, and stains pile up fast. When it's time to clean them, you've got choices. Some people grab a shoe cleaner kit, while others reach for a vacuum cleaner. So which one actually works better?

Let's break down what each tool does and when you should use it.

**What a Vacuum Cleaner Does for Shoes**

A vacuum cleaner pulls loose dirt, dust, and debris from your shoes. It works great for getting crumbs out of sneakers or removing surface dust. If you've got dirt sitting on top of your shoes, a quick vacuum gets the job done fast.

But here's the catch: vacuums don't handle stains, scuffs, or deep-set grime. They can't scrub away mud caked into the grooves of your sneakers. They won't restore the fresh look of white shoes or remove those yellow stains that build up over time.

**What a Shoe Cleaner Kit Brings to the Table**

A shoe cleaner kit gives you the full package. Most kits include cleaning solution, brushes with different bristle types, and sometimes even microfiber cloths. These tools actually scrub away dirt, remove tough stains, and bring your shoes back to life.

The cleaning solution breaks down oils and grime that a vacuum can't touch. The brushes let you work on different materials—soft bristles for delicate fabrics, stiffer ones for rubber soles. You can clean canvas sneakers, leather dress shoes, suede boots, and everything in between.

Plus, shoe cleaning kits work on the stuff that matters most: making your shoes look new again. They tackle grass stains, coffee spills, and the general grossness that builds up over time.

**The Real Winner**

If you want truly clean shoes, [a quality shoe cleaner kit](https://athomewave.com/shoe-cleaner-kit) wins every time. Vacuums are useful for quick surface cleaning, but they can't deep clean or remove stains. A proper cleaning kit handles both everyday dirt and stubborn marks.

Think about it this way: would you only vacuum your floor and never mop it? Same idea applies to your shoes.

**What to Look for in a Good Kit**

Not all shoe cleaning kits are the same. You want one with multiple brush types so you can safely clean different shoe materials. A good cleaning formula that works on various fabrics matters too. Some kits also include protectors that help keep shoes cleaner longer.

The best part? Most shoe care kits are affordable and last for months. One bottle of cleaner can handle dozens of pairs of shoes.

**Bottom Line**

A vacuum cleaner helps with loose dirt, but it's not a real cleaning solution for shoes. If you care about keeping your sneakers, boots, and everyday shoes looking fresh, [investing in a shoe cleaner kit](https://athomewave.com/shoe-cleaner-kit) makes sense. It's the only way to actually clean your shoes properly and make them last longer.

Your shoes are an investment. Taking a few minutes to clean them the right way keeps them looking better and lasting longer. Skip the vacuum-only approach and get the tools that actually work.",1,1764759171.0,hubproducts,0,1.0,False

1st time at any warehouse .. I’ve heard so much in so lil time I watch a million ppl break safety rules . I watch ppl pick over 10 w ppl waiting yet I watch everybody listening to headphones 
I have a million and 1 possible safety complaints 

Ppl trying to pick 20 persons behind them helping them load they’re 20 while a 3rd person wtg 
I never know what anyone is saying but forced to listen speaking another language no pun intended no disrespect But I can’t wear headphones Yet I’m Patiently waiting and burbling and mumbling in English 

How Then did I have a purple vest approach me and say they used to look like me when they was dehydrated (I still don’t know what that look is ) however. They said coffee hydrates you. 

I had a blue badge approach me and tell me at 50ish I had too much coffee in my mug 
Like where’s my mom and my dad . I get them trying to be helpful but everyone energy boost is different 

Lastly I had a coworker say TAKE YOUR TIME THERES NO RUSH …We GET PAID BY THE HOUR .  Then he asked me why I am working so fast 

My answer : I actually enjoy what I do . the harder I work the faster time flies 
If they are watching I don’t want complaining I want to be impressive . I’m here to work and for no other reason than that 

I drink coffee the safest energy booster and unfortunate coffee has benefits I take a multi vitamin for women. And I have been drinking more water. 

and why I work fast actually it’s just my own personal pace I didn’t realize I was working faster or slower than anime cause I’m not watching them 

But if I did work at a slower speed I would get a rating comment from the managers according to other posts 

I didn’t even know they come to you about low rates 

No one has ever said anything to me about low rate picking .. So is that a good thing ??or is it I’m seasonal it don’t matter She won’t be here long this 

Blue badges Some very helpful Some know too much or think they know . Some blue badges kill Whateva optimism I may have had 

Blue badges already told me OH YOU LL BE LAID OFF AFTER PEAK ok thanks for the encouragement 

I came here with the intent of aiming for a blue badge I came here with goal in mind

I believe I’ve started looking do other work already I am I can’t help it 

I have days  scheduled until early February 

Wondering if that’s my last day 

I need my job It’s not a joke to me I’m a homeowner and handle all financial alone 

Idk what to believe I AM SHOCKED at what I’ve seen and heard And how ppl seriously could careless about rules or efforts 

Just wish II knew if I had a job after early February

We aren’t heaps close, but we have coffee together every 2 months or so. It’s our kids who are proper friends.

The psychologist friend often asks how it’s going, but all they do is empathise with the situation whereas I’ve been more interested in trying to brainstorm what the issue could be. When I talk to my non psychologist friends/acquaintances I find they not only empathise with me, but also try to brainstorm what the issue could be. They often come up with really good ideas which then relay to my kid’s health professionals. 

I understand that the psychologist might not what to cross professional boundaries, but that happens in load of professions. There are a bunch of ways to talk around a topic. Eg. Financial advisors might not be able to give advice but they can brainstorm possible investments methods and suggest that Indi my financial advisor about them. 

Honestly, I don’t actually need advice from the psychologist friend, I’ve actually stopped bringing up the topic over a year a go, but they keep asking me about it. We have a stack of other stuff in common and don’t otherwise run out of stuff to talk about. 

Are psychologists more cagey about talking about stuff that relates to their work. What is your experience?

That strange month where the year feels both finished and unfinished at the same time. Everything slows down and speeds up simultaneously. And honestly… I’m feeling all of it.

November was fucking busy — not in a complaining way, more in that “I actually like this chaos” kind of way. Brisbane → Melbourne → Sydney → back to Brisbane, rinse and repeat. Melbourne really showed off this time too; cold enough that venues literally had fireplaces running. Cozy, atmospheric, perfect. Which, of course, made stepping off the plane into Brisbane’s humid slap-in-the-face heat even more brutal. Classic Queensland.

While I was in Melbourne I stumbled across this little market stall thingy-majigy selling a mountain of Stitch merch — blankets, towels, plushies, weird stuff, cute stuff. I grabbed this light blanket-or-towel (still not sure what the fuck it technically is) and instantly thought, *this would be a good little gift for The Chemist*. Funny thing — on a previous work trip I almost got them a Stitch figurine, but I bailed on it under the guise of “don’t collect random shit for other people.” Well… apparently I do now.

Anyway, I’ve been on the same campus as them for the last three days, and yesterday we found a little window to catch up so I could give it to them. Hard to read with them sometimes, but it seemed to be well received. I think so. I hope so.

God, I always love spending time with this person. It’s easy. It’s grounding. It’s… nice in that way where it feels rare.

And then — in the most casual, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment — it came up that we’re both single this summer. I wasn’t ready. Didn’t expect it. Don’t even remember the exact context. But it hit me. I’ve basically spent the whole year thinking they were seeing someone else, all the way back to that coffee catch-up in December ’23.

It reminded me of something else too: last weekend when she mentioned she’d withdrawn from going to a music festival because she didn’t really know the person she was meant to go with. It stuck with me for some reason — like a background puzzle piece suddenly clicking.

Fuck, this is taking too long to get to the point.

Natasha Burnett awoke one fateful morning, her mind swirling in disbelief as she realized she had inexplicably returned to the age of 27.

In this bewildering twist of fate, she found herself married to none other than Evander Palmer, the richest man in the world, a titan of industry whose name dominated the Forbes list. He had once been celebrated by Time magazine as “The Most Desirable Bachelor,” a title that had attracted the attention of even the most esteemed European royalty, all vying to match their princesses with him.

People often whispered about Natasha’s extraordinary luck, yet in this new chapter of her life, the very first action she took was to seek out Penelope Holyfield—the woman who had always held Evander’s heart—and present her with divorce papers.

With a resolute push, Natasha slid the documents across the table, her expression unwavering. “I want a divorce. You can have Evander and the kids.”

Penelope’s eyes widened in disbelief, her mouth slightly agape as she processed the suddenness of Natasha’s declaration. After six long years of clinging to Evander, she was now faced with this unexpected turn of events.

Natasha’s voice was devoid of emotion, flat as the surface of a still lake. “They all prefer you. I’m simply giving them what they want. Just get Evander to sign. After the waiting period, I’ll be gone.”

She was determined not to repeat the mistakes of her past. The thought of living another lifetime as the invisible wife was utterly unacceptable to her.

Penelope’s fingers nervously traced the rim of her coffee cup, her brow knitting with anxiety. “Natasha, what is this? What are you trying to pull?”

Seeing the confusion etched on Penelope’s face, Natasha reiterated, “I’m not pulling anything. I’m just done.”

\*\*Chapter 1\*\*

\*\*Rai Ek Samaan R\*\*

“Do you have any idea how many women would kill to be you?” Penelope questioned, a hint of incredulity lacing her voice.

“I do,” Natasha replied, her gaze unwavering and fierce. “But soon, they would kill to be you.”

For the first time, Penelope felt a flicker of temptation.

She scrutinized the papers for a lengthy moment before finally reaching for them. “Alright. I suppose I have to take the chance.”",1,1764757629.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

In this bewildering twist of fate, she found herself married to none other than Evander Palmer, the richest man in the world, a titan of industry whose name dominated the Forbes list. He had once been celebrated by Time magazine as “The Most Desirable Bachelor,” a title that had attracted the attention of even the most esteemed European royalty, all vying to match their princesses with him.

People often whispered about Natasha’s extraordinary luck, yet in this new chapter of her life, the very first action she took was to seek out Penelope Holyfield—the woman who had always held Evander’s heart—and present her with divorce papers.

With a resolute push, Natasha slid the documents across the table, her expression unwavering. “I want a divorce. You can have Evander and the kids.”

Penelope’s eyes widened in disbelief, her mouth slightly agape as she processed the suddenness of Natasha’s declaration. After six long years of clinging to Evander, she was now faced with this unexpected turn of events.

Natasha’s voice was devoid of emotion, flat as the surface of a still lake. “They all prefer you. I’m simply giving them what they want. Just get Evander to sign. After the waiting period, I’ll be gone.”

She was determined not to repeat the mistakes of her past. The thought of living another lifetime as the invisible wife was utterly unacceptable to her.

Penelope’s fingers nervously traced the rim of her coffee cup, her brow knitting with anxiety. “Natasha, what is this? What are you trying to pull?”

Seeing the confusion etched on Penelope’s face, Natasha reiterated, “I’m not pulling anything. I’m just done.”

“Do you have any idea how many women would kill to be you?” Penelope questioned, a hint of incredulity lacing her voice.

“I do,” Natasha replied, her gaze unwavering and fierce. “But soon, they would kill to be you.”

For the first time, Penelope felt a flicker of temptation.

She scrutinized the papers for a lengthy moment before finally reaching for them. “Alright. I suppose I have to take the chance.”",1,1764757623.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False
