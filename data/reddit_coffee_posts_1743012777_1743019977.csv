1jkiifh,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1jkiifh/home_brewing_stain/,Home brewing stain,"Hi! I'm primarily a visual artist & used to work in a frame shop, have been making my own frames for the past two years or so. So far I've primarily used the minwax dark walnut danish oil to finish them, and have been happy enough with the results. I'm going to start looking for a better/homemade solution though, and I'd love yall's thoughts. Here are my goals/reasons for making my own:

* I don't have a ventilated indoor space to work in, so I right now I am only finishing frames when it's nice enough out to let them dry all day (I live in Michigan so this is a pretty limiting constraint). I'd like something with 0 fumes, and drying time is not a concern as I can start frames many weeks before they're needed.
* The color of the danish oil is a little bit more neutral/gray that what I would ideally want. This is of course informed by the wood as much as the stain but I'd like to push it just a little bit warmer.
* Commercial stains are expensive, and I'm tired of reading dire prop 65 warnings. I know they're on everything under the sun but it's just a nice feeling to know what all is in something and not be concerned about any of it.
* Making things is fun! Experimenting is fun!

Here is what I am trying so far: A stain made of coffee (for warmth/red-brown) and steeped black walnuts (for darkness/gray-brown), applied in a couple of coats, with a single coat of tung oil over for a tiny bit of protection & glow. Considering also adding some dark iron oxide. I don't want any gloss, I just want to darken the wood a little, make the grain pop, and make it slightly easier to dust. I'm pretty happy with the results so far, particularly on cedar! My questions:

* Have you made your own stain before? What ingredients worked best for you?
* Am I missing something major here? It seems surprisingly straightforward, but since I'm not looking to protect from wear & tear it seems like if it looks good, it is good.
* This one seems to require a number of layers of intersecting knowledge, but just in case there are any combo woodworker/conservator/chemists out there: To what extent does acidity migrate through wood over time? Would I need to neutralize the stain before applying in order to make the frames archival?
