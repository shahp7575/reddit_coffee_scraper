1mfl8h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1mfl8h9/son_of_a_veteran_with_severe_ptsd/,Son of a veteran with severe PTSD,I’m about to turn 15 and been seeing my dad get better but every now and then he has a episode and I’m the only person who can get him back in a mental state. About 3 years ago my dad had a serious episode where he *had a dorm party* that was in are kitchen and somehow popped off the top of a 2 liter soda and sprayed it around and had a dorm party with his dead buddies. Then went to his garage that he thought was a space station and then got scared of aliens BTW he watched a lot of ancient aliens after he got back but besides that he went into a frenzy in the living room and started hand to hand combat to the carpet and then stayed sitting down then kept asking my mom *where is jeffrey* that’s me btw but when my mom got me to talk with he he looked me in the eyes and said I need to walk and I took him on a walk around the park and I kept having to keep him stable. After the walk he was still in the state but calming down but I made him sit on the couch and waited until the piece of shit ambulance pulled up and started asking my mom question and mention how she should relief his stress basically saying have sex with a fucking man whose in a episode.  After that he got token for a week and was hard to go a week without my dad but he came back happy he just said don’t take from his stash. Keep in mind I’m a stoner but when this happend I didn’t even smoke yet so he was definitely having things put in his head that didn’t happend.  I’m making this so I can better understand next time and also advise of how I can make his life better as a son it’s hard to fully dedicate to my dad all the time but every now and then we have breakfast at a cafe and we have are eggs and hashbrowns and coffee.  ,1,1754122330.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False
1mfl85d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mfl85d/i_wore_a_wedding_gown_drenched_in_the_blood_of_my/,I Wore a Wedding Gown Drenched in the Blood of My Rivals,"I wore a wedding gown drenched in the blood of my rivals.  
The same wolves who tormented me for years until the Alpha chose me as his bride.  
He destroyed them one by one right in front of me as a punishment for killing my inner wolf.  
Red spilled from Talia's mouth and pooled onto the kitchen floor.  
Talia was resigned to the abuse.  
An omega, a mere servant, an orphan she-wolf too weak to shift.  
 “Clean it up,” Marcy ordered.  
 Talia scrubbed the floor, the bruises on her knees mirroring those across her body.  
Talia lived in the shadows, neglected and hidden away in the attic like an unwanted secret.  
 Her days were spent scrubbing, serving, surviving.  
 Her nights were spent curled on a moldy mattress with a tattered copy of Cinderella—  
 The last piece of a life stolen long ago. She knew fairytales didn’t come true. Not for her.  
 Her inner wolf had gone silent years ago, snuffed out by malnutrition, abuse, and pain.  
 Without it, she was nothing more than a human in a world of predators.  
 Why had her inner wolf abandoned her? Was there any force on earth—fire, war, love—that could bring it back?  
 She woke from another day of hard labour, her body sore and worn from mistreatment.  
 There were whispers through the pack, electric, hushed, breathless.  
 A visitor was coming. Alpha Damon, leader of the Dark Howlers—fiercest pack in the realm.  
 He was the most powerful Alpha in all of North America.  
 Women threw themselves at him. Rulers feared him. He could seduce a she-wolf with a glance or tear out a man’s throat just as easily.  
 Damon was untouchable. He scorned the idea of love, rejected every political match.  
 Not a single potential bride, despite the many presented, could win his affection.  
 None were worthy of being his Luna—the proud she-wolf to rule by his side.  
 Love was a distraction, an attempt to tame him, and Damon would never be tamed. Still, there were those who tried.  
 Alpha Edward, leader of the Red Moon pack, was desperate to secure his political power.  
 He invited Damon to meet his daughter—Princess Marcy. Beautiful, cunning, cruel. She intended to make him hers.  
 Talia feared their union. Would Marcy succeed where so many others had failed? Would Marcy’s cruelty only intensify, as Luna to such a powerful Alpha?  
Alpha Edward’s personal omega comes running up to me while I’m making lunch and tells me the Alpha wants to see me in his office right away.  
 I drop what I am doing and hurry to his office. I knock on the door quietly in case he is busy.  
 “Come in,” he calls from inside. I pull open the door and peek inside.  
 “You called for me, Alpha?” I asked as quietly as possible. The easiest way to get away from him is to use as few words and ask as few questions as possible.  
 “Don’t just stand there, come in,” he snarls.  
 I rush inside and close the door behind me. I stay as close to the door as possible in case I need to make a run for it.  
“Talia, we have a delegation coming from the Dark Howlers pack next week. Twenty wolves in total.  
 All of their ranked members, their mates, the heads of their security and guards, and security details for all of them.  
 If all goes well, we’ll be forming a pact with them. They must be treated with the utmost respect and courtesy.  
 Bring lunches to the conference room every day and make a formal dinner every day of the next week.  
 Keep their pantries stocked and stay out of the way. Got it?”  
I look up from under my hat, still keeping my face low enough that he can’t see my eyes.  
 Yes, even after almost two months, he still hasn’t noticed that I have purple eyes. Or if he has, he hasn’t pointed it out.  
 He also hasn’t said anything about my silver hair, which is just fine with me.  
 “Yes, sir.”  
“Everyone will be here on Monday, except for the Alpha, who’s coming Tuesday. We’ll be having a party after dinner to welcome him.  
 Make sure there is enough food for the party. Give George the information for the additional food you need to make. Do you understand?”  
 “Yes, sir.”  
 “Good. We need to keep the Alpha happy. If not, I won’t hesitate to let him harm you. Do you understand?”  
He stands up with his hands on the desk, looking very intimidating.  
 “Ye… Yes, sir.”  
 “Now, get out of my sight.”  
 He points to the door behind me. I scramble out of the room as fast as possible to find George.  
George is in charge of ordering supplies for the pack house. He should be in his office right now.  
 My mind is already churning through the special foods to make and the groceries I need for them.  
 I also need extra supplies for the guest suite pantries. I wonder what kind of foods the Dark Howlers pack likes.  
Dark Howlers is the largest pack in the northern region, with my pack, Red Moon, being the second largest.  
 Alpha Edward says Dark Howlers is vicious and strict. Most of their pack has served in the military at one point or another.  
 They employ dark magicians and witches to help them keep power over the neighbouring packs.  
 I wonder if they’re going to bring any dark witches here. I hope not.  
I also hear their Alpha expels pack members who fail training tests because he doesn’t want weak wolves in his pack.  
 A guy I don’t want to cross paths with.  
I get to George’s office and knock on the door. I can hear noises coming from inside, but he doesn’t answer.  
 I knock a little louder. What the hell? He has to know I am here. He knows my scent.  
 Just tell me to come in already.  
I knock again, more impatiently this time.  
 “What is it?” he finally growls from inside.  
I open the door to find there’s a female wolf sitting on his desk. She hides her face in his chest.  
 I can’t see who she is, but there’s no denying whose scent it is.  
 George stands there, disheveled and sweaty, his shirt half-buttoned and face flushed.  
 “Get the hell out, Talia. I’m busy here.”  
I stand there wide-eyed, jaw slack for a moment. I can’t be seeing this.  
 George is having a fine time in his office with Luna Layla.  
 “Get out, Talia,” he yells louder.  
I come to my senses and slam the door closed.  
 I run back to the kitchen as fast as I can. I can feel the drip of sweat down my face.  
 If anyone finds out what I just saw, I am finished.  
George storms into the kitchen, his expression thunderous. He grips my arm tightly. Suddenly I am shoved back against the wall. I flinch as his raised fist hovers, but he stops just short, the threat lingering in the air.  
My head hits the wall, and a wave of dizziness blurs my vision.  
I can feel my nose snap as I slide down the wall with a groan.  
 “You didn’t see anything.”  
I feel a sting at my neck as his grip tightens.  
 “You understand? You little monster.”  
I am paralyzed with fear. I can’t answer. I can’t even nod.  
 Suddenly I feel like I am falling backwards in my mind.  
 I blink quickly a few times. It feels like I am looking out of someone else’s eyes.  
“LET HER GO!”  
 The voice comes from me, but it isn’t my voice. It’s Sylvie.  
 Her voice booms and sounds almost ethereal.  
 The dishes on the counter shake as she growls deeply at George.  
I watch helplessly as my hand glows violet and grabs George’s wrist.  
 As I grab him, his eyes widen in fear and he starts howling in pain.  
 A sizzling sound comes from where my hand connects with his skin.  
 He quickly releases my neck, and we both fall to the ground.  
“How are you doing this? What are you, Talia?”  
I stand up, feeling much taller than my 5-foot-tall frame.  
 Sylvie’s voice booms from me.  
 “I AM A WARRIOR CHILD OF THE MOON GODDESS.  
 And if you tell anyone what has happened here today, I will make you suffer.”  
George scoots back on his backside away from me, wide-eyed, then clambers up and runs away as fast as he can.  
 Suddenly, I come back into my normal state of mind and I fall back to the ground, exhausted.  
My hands are no longer glowing, but they feel like they’re on and full of static electricity.  
 What was with the glowy purple burnt hands thing? That’s not normal.  
“Talia, you are a child of the Moon Goddess. You are special.  
 There is more to you—you will see after we shift for the first time.  
 Until then, I am not strong enough to show you.  
 Besides, it isn’t like I hurt him badly. His wolf will heal him before he is back in his office.”  
“I… I do…”  
 “Wait, you mean the Moon Goddess is my actual mom?  
 Like, she gave birth to me specifically?  
 Not just like ‘mother of all werewolves’ because she created us a gazillion years ago?”  
“That’s what I’ve been saying since I came. It’s not my fault you didn’t believe me.”  
I picked up a towel to wipe the stain from my nose.  
 Sylvie is already healing me from the break, but my face is going to be bruised for a couple of days.  
 I pull my hat down low so no one can see the bruises, then pick up the first two platters and rush out to the dining room.  
“Okay, well, if you’re able to do that to George, how come you can’t do it to Alpha Edward or Marcy?”  
 “Well, I think it happened one time before, but I wasn’t fully in control then.  
 I can’t do it now because he’s your Alpha. I can’t go against what he says.  
 I can’t attack your Alpha or his daughter.”  
I concede. I don’t want to argue with her.  
 I am just trying to figure out the rules. I am in uncharted territory here.  
 I mean, it’s cool territory, but I don’t know what our limits are.  
Once all the platters are out, I make a list of all the extra supplies I need and put it in the box hanging outside George’s office.  
 That way, I don’t have to face him again.  
I clean up the dining room after lunch and still have about 45 minutes until I have to start dinner.  
 I decide to go to the stock room and put supplies on the pantry cart for later.  
As I work, I hear someone clear their throat behind me.  
 I look up to find Marcy standing there uncomfortably close to me.  
 “Can I help you with something, Marcy?”  
I try to swallow the panic that instantly builds in my throat.  
 “Talia, I just wanted to say, when I am in control of the pack, you won’t be treated the way you are now.”  
“Marcy, please stop.”  
 I put my hands up and push slightly against her to get her to move.  
 But she is stronger than me and doesn’t budge.  
I look up at her to see an evil grin distorting her face.  
 “I see the way my dad treats you, Talia. You never complain, you just take it.”  
She invades my space, a smug look in her eyes. ‘You look so desperate when you're trying to impress my father,’ she whispers mockingly.”   
 “I bet you like it when he does it, don’t you?”  
WHAT?  
 There is no way I heard her right. Did I?  
“Marcy, I do not enjoy what your father does to me.  
 And you’re no better standing there watching him, instead of stopping him.”  
She places a hand on my side, too close for comfort. I stiffen, unsure of her intentions.  
 I cannot believe this is happening right now.  
""Don’t lie to me, Talia. You’re different. Something about you messes with my head. Maybe I’ll make the basement your own twisted playground.”  
She leans in, and I feel her breath near my face. A chill runs through me.  
But I don’t have anywhere to move to get away from her.  
“Are you insane?”  
 I push hard against her but she’s too strong. She doesn’t budge.  
“Get off of me, you sicko!”  
 Her voice is rough and ragged with excitement.  
 I am afraid to fight back or even say anything.  
Sylvie can’t help me because she’s the Alpha’s daughter.  
 Moon Goddess, if you’re my mother, please help me.  
 Please save me from this.  
I turn my mind off—just like when her father beat me within an inch of my life.  
 My mind cannot be present for what is happening to me.  
 “Get up, Talia. I said get up. You’re better than this. You will survive this.”  
""I’m overwhelmed, Sylvie. Everything feels like too much. I just want peace.""  
 YOU can and you will.  
 You will find your mate soon enough, and things will change. I promise.  
“How can you be so sure?”  
 “Glowy burning hands are not your only gift.”  
I go back to my room to find new clothes before making dinner.  
 The next four days go without incident.  
Unless you consider the fact that I’ve found myself on the roof a lot lately, staring into the sky, searching for answers.  
Sometimes I stand at the edge of the four-story building, letting the wind hit my face, imagining a life where I’m free—just for a moment.  
 I can’t bring myself to do anything except cry and go back to my room.  
 I can’t do it to Sylvie.  
 I can’t take her life, because I want to take mine.  
Sunday after dinner service, I see Luna Layla in the hallway while I am refilling pantries.  
 She quickly approaches me and grabs me by the arm.  
 She extends her claws into my bicep, drawing blood.  
“Talia, if you tell anyone—and I mean anyone—what you saw in George’s office, I will make you suffer,” she says in a low, threatening tone.  
 “You too, lady. I am fed up.”  
Does she want to bully me?  
 Okay, fine.  
I lift my hat and let my violet eyes look directly at her. She gasps at the unusual sight.  
 “Luna, it would be a relief, and I would welcome it.  
You… You don’t know or care how I am treated by this pack—including by your husband, your daughter, and your lover.”  
Tears choke up my throat.  
 I cannot take any more punishment from anyone else. I am at my wits’ end.  
 If she takes my life right here in this hallway, it would be a relief.  
“I whisper to Sylvie that I’m tired, so very tired, as I fix my eyes on Luna Layla and try to stay strong.”  
She doesn’t respond.  
 She shuts her mind-link and crawls into the corner of my mind.  
Luna Layla pushes me away.  
 “Insolent child! You should be grateful for your life. The Alpha will hear about this.”  
“I am not grateful for this life, Luna.  
 And if you think I should be, you are part of the problem.  
If you want to tell the Alpha about this incident, I am more than happy to tell him what instigated it.”  
She stares at me with pure anger and hatred before walking away, without a word. I guess fate has other plans for me. I stand in the hall for a few minutes to see if she is coming back, but she doesn’t. I am certain she is going to sabotage me. Maybe she is going to smother me in my sleep or just stab me straight in the back. Either way, I was serious when I told her I welcome her.  
I finish pantry duty, making sure everything is set in the guest rooms. I had George order bouquets for each of the suites as an extra touch. In the guest Alpha’s suite, I also added a bottle of champagne. If this is the last thing I ever get to do, I want it to be something that makes someone else happy.  
It is almost 1:30 in the morning before I plop into my bed, totally exhausted. It has been a day. If Luna Layla has anything to say about it, it’ll probably be my last.  
Sylvi is exhausted too. She stopped sulking long enough to tell me she needs me to shift, but I can’t. I have no time or energy. I keep promising her I will, but I feel like I have broken that promise. I float off to the sound of her whimpering in my head while I cry into my pillow.  
To my surprise, my alarm wakes me in the morning. Sylvi makes me promise to hang on for one more day. We go through the motions of the life I hate. While I am getting ready, I look in the mirror to find my hair is completely silvery now. I tuck it into a bun to try to avoid people noticing it.  
The delegation from Dark Howlers arrives in the early afternoon. They are all tall and intimidating, with tattoos and big muscles. Some of them have visible scars on their arms and faces. They wear matching business attire or security uniforms. Luna Layla directs them to the sitting room while I quietly bring in pitchers of water and iced tea for them to drink. I was doing my best, trying not to be noticed.  
And one of the women calls me out. “You there, Omega,” she says abruptly. I look around and realise she is speaking to me. For everyone.  
“Maya, of course, right away,” Luna says quickly and nods her head to me. I rush to the cellar and pull out two cases of napkins and glasses. I prep the drink service cart and head back to the sitting room. I open three bottles, leaving the rest for them to do as they wish. And then I back out of the room so I can start preparing dinner.  
The rest of the day goes without a hitch.  
The guests seem pleased with dinner. In the evening, I go to each guest’s suite to make sure everyone is happy with their accommodations. A couple of people ask for more bags of chips or soda, but on the whole, everyone seems satisfied.  
The last door is the Beta’s room. Maya opens the door, looking much more relaxed than earlier. She has a large tattoo of a rose and dagger on her forearm. Her dark hair is still pulled back, but she isn’t wearing makeup. I can see now. She looks only a few years older than me. I can hear a mate inside talking on the phone.  
“Thanks for checking on us. Everything is wonderful. The flowers are a beautiful touch. You have good taste.” She smiles at me.  
I bow to her slightly, then turn to leave.  
“Wait, what’s under your hat?”  
I stop in my tracks and turn around. “I am sorry, ma’am?” I ask. I feel the blood drain from my face.  
“Your hat? Why is it so low? What are you trying to hide? Come closer.”  
I come closer and slowly take off my hat, keeping my eyes to the ground. My silver hair cascades down my back. It is embarrassingly greasy and visibly dirty. I feel myself blush.  
""Oh, I see. Now don’t be disrespectful. Always look me in the eye when I speak to you.""  
I look up at her. The light from her room shines right into my eyes. She looks at me blankly for a moment, trying to process what she is seeing.  
""What are you? A hybrid?""  
""No ma’am, the pack doctor did tests but he doesn’t know why it happened. He thinks it must be a transformation related to my wolf getting ready to wake up.""  
I mean, it’s not a lie. It’s just not the whole truth. Right?  
How am I supposed to tell a stranger that my wolf says that I am the Moon Goddess’s actual daughter and that that is why I have silver hair and violet eyes?  
She grabs my chin and pulls my face closer to hers, inspecting closely.  
""And does the pack doctor know that someone has broken your nose recently? You still have bruises.""  
I am not going to elaborate or implicate anyone in this conversation with someone I do not know.  
""Who's at the door, Maya?""  
""Just the omega assigned to us, Cade. What’s your name again?""  
""It’s Talia, ma’am. I am not an omega though. I’m just a servant.""  
""Her name is Talia. She picked out my beautiful flowers.""  
She is still talking to her mate but she hasn’t taken her eyes off me, as if she’s trying to size me up for some reason. Her brow furrows slightly as she stares.  
She’s making me self-conscious.  
""That’s nice. Ask her if I can get bubbly water in the refrigerator.""  
""No problem, ma’am.""  
She and I share a smile at ""bubbly water.""  
""I will bring it shortly and leave it at the door.""  
""Thank you. Oh, and Talia—if those bruises are not healed by tomorrow morning, find some powder. Alpha Damon does not tolerate seeing injuries like that.""  
""Ye... yes ma’am.""  
I run to the stockroom, get four bottles of San Pellegrino, and put them in front of the door, then run away as fast as I can. One million questions run through my head.  
Will their Alpha be angry at me for being weaker than other wolves, even if I was not a part of his pack? Was she going to tell Alpha Edward about my unusual features? Was she going to call him out for letting someone break my nose?  
I mean, lady, if you think that is bad, I got some news that you’re not going to like. And then I am dead meat—by your Alpha. For sure.  
Alpha Edward later reprimands me harshly for failing to gather all the items our guests requested.  
By morning, Sylvie has still not been able to fully heal me. I am in so much pain. Everything is a struggle—cooking, carrying breakfast trays, leaning over to clean tables. Every move causes scabs to open and bleed, making the back of my shirt damp with blood.  
Maya makes eye contact with me a couple of times. She can tell something was wrong but doesn’t say anything. For some reason she can’t explain, Sylvie is bouncing around in my head all morning.  
The beta is so nice. I can’t wait to meet the Alpha and Luna.  
“Sylvie, come on. We’re not going to meet the Alpha and Luna. We’re going to melt into the wallpaper and pretend we don’t exist.”  
“I want to meet them.”  
“OK, well, I hate to disappoint you, but you’re going to be disappointed.”  
Layla comes in while I am prepping lunch to let me know that Alpha has arrived, and I need to make lunch for him as well. There is no Luna.  
“He doesn’t have a mate?”  
And according to Layla, he’s handsome. Not that it matters to me. Because I am going to be wallpaper. I don’t want him to notice me at all.  
I take the trays to the conference room. Alpha Damon is not there, but there is a spot at the table where he is supposed to sit. I leave his meal at the empty seat.  
Everyone from the Dark Howlers pack politely thanks me as I lay out plates in front of them. Their manners betray their intimidating features. No one from the Red Moon pack says a word to me as I serve them.  
I collect the trays and walk out quietly. Layla lets me know she will clean the plates so I can focus on dinner and food for the party. I go to the kitchen but need a minute to collect myself before I get started on dinner.  
I go out the back door and stand on the stoop. In the distance, I don’t recognize him. It must be the Alpha from Dark Howlers. He is too far away from me to see his actual features, though. All I can see is a tall figure with dark hair in a suit.  
It smells like— I swear— it smells like coffee or dark chocolate. This guy was a mocha drinker?  
I laughed to myself at the thought of the big bad Alpha of Dark Howlers sipping on a mochaccino.  
I make a four-course meal of Caesar salad, bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizers, beef Wellington with braised Brussels sprouts for the main dish, and a key lime pie for dessert.  
I also make bruschetta, tomato fritters, mini calzones, assorted veggie trays with dip, and chocolate truffles to serve for the party. I finish the desserts and veggie trays between breakfast and lunch so there was less for me to worry about now.  
I realise Sylvie’s advice of finding happiness in cooking has helped me enjoy making this dinner. Maybe because I am serving people other than my pack. Or maybe it’s because I am making special food, not just the regular stuff I make for the pack.  
Either way, I don’t mind my work today. I felt a sense of pride in it.  
There are servers for dinner service since it’s a formal event. I stay in the kitchen and make sure everything is plated and going out the door in perfect condition. I am in the zone.  
I peek out from the kitchen after each course is served. People seemed to enjoy the food, which is a relief.  
I notice Alpha Edward is getting pretty drunk. Luna Layla keeps taking his glass away from him, but he keeps ordering the omegas to give him more.  
The dining room is extra crowded, so I don’t get a better look at Alpha Damon.  
Maya sees me peeking out from the kitchen and gives me a wink and thumbs-up. I smile and give a little wave before pulling my head back.  
I help the servers take the party food to the tables at the edges of the ballroom.  
I also make sure the bars in the corners are fully stocked. The DJ is finishing setting up and colorful lights are sliding across the floor. Party balloons and streamers are hanging all over the place. The first few guests are starting to wander in, which is my cue to duck out the back door.   
Luckily, the dinner servers will clean up after the dinner service tonight, which gives me extra time to restock pantries. I head upstairs to the stock room and load the cart up. I am humming to myself as I go from room to room. I feel an odd sense of calm as I go.  
You are in a good mood.  
 I guess. I am not sure why though. My back and feet still hurt.  
 Well, I am happy that you're happy for once. This version of you is pretty cool.  
 Thanks, Sylvie. You're not half bad yourself.  
I finish stocking the pack members’ rooms on the fourth and third floors, then I head to the second floor where the guest suites are. The cleaning staff has cleaned everything. I just need to restock the toiletries, pantry items, and refrigerators. I make quick work of the rooms. I remember to stock the Beta’s room with more bottles of San Pellegrino, refresh the flowers, and leave a little tent card with a handwritten smiley face on the kitchenette counter. It's almost midnight now. Everyone is still in the ballroom partying.  
I close the door to the Beta’s suite and move to the Alpha’s suite door. It’s the last room left for the night. I know he's at the party too, but I knock first just in case. I lean my ear against the door. I don’t hear a reply.  
I am not sure if he has been in the room yet, but I need to check and make sure, just in case it needs to be restocked. I slip the keycard in the slot and open the door. But the moment I looked inside, my heart stopped. And I froze. Standing there was the most handsome werewolf I had ever seen in my life. Easily 6 foot 6 inches tall. Looked to be about 250 pounds of solid muscle with the broadest shoulders. But he wasn’t alone. An icy blonde stood in front of him with her hands undoing his belt.  
The smell of coffee and dark chocolate filled the air and my mind went hazy as I froze, seeing two piercing blue eyes staring back at me.  
 STOP! he shouted.  
 Is this it? Is this the day I die, I wondered.  
I was only doing my job, but that did not change the fact that I had witnessed something that should not have been seen. Before I could move, he lunged forward and roughly pinned me against the floor outside the room with a low growl. He placed both hands on my shoulders, preventing me from escaping, put his face against my neck and inhaled deeply.  
My heart was pounding in my chest as overwhelming panic began to set in.  
 Alpha Damon, is this omega trying to steal something? a guard said, seeing the struggle.  
 Get back, he snarled, flashing his large fangs.  
 MINE, he growled.  
Over his shoulder, I could faintly see Marcy staring daggers at me. And down the hall, I heard Alpha Edward shouting.  
 What a disaster, I thought. They’re all going to kill me. My head started swimming and I felt even dizzier. Maybe I was finally dying.  
 Look what you’ve done, you little witch!  
Marcy yelled as she reached out to grab me, but she never touched me.  
 Alpha Damon growled and caught her hand mid-air, twisting it away sharply as she recoiled.  
 Alpha Edward roared, How dare you! This is war!  
I watched them fight as if it was a dream.  
 They looked as though they were moving in slow motion.  
 Alpha Edward yanked Marcy, pulling her back as Damon snarled at them. He was vicious.  
 Beautifully vicious.  
A guard tried to separate them as Beta Caden and Maya took defensive positions around Alpha Damon. And George lunged at Damon, but he was no match to the Alpha.  
Damon seized George by the collar and flung him aside effortlessly, sending him crashing into the wall as though he were a tiny pup. I almost laughed, but I was shaking all over. Barely able to stand. But in the chaos, I managed to crawl away and slink down the stairs.  
I looked around to see if anyone noticed me, but they were all too busy arguing. I looked down to see blood running down my legs, dripping onto the floor. I started to lose consciousness. And then I heard it. The most guttural, ear-shattering roar:  
 Where is she?  
 Where is who, Alpha Damon?  
 Where is my mate?!  
Is it possible? Is Talia truly Damon’s fated mate?  
 What will Damon do to protect her?  
 Will their bond ignite a war between the two most powerful packs in the order?  
 Will any of them leave the Red Moon territory alive?",1,1754122294.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Super love bombing, honey words and naming in less than a month of my arrival.
I decided to accept while understanding the strangeness of the situation, just to see the processes.
Already from the first week the first oddities were noticed: I would propose something, and one or more managers would give a fake cough to embarrass me, or publicly scold me for my arrogance (I studied every form of Buddhism, sent two theses to two universities, receiving compliments from university professors both in Japan and India).
It didn't take me long to understand the true nature of these people: in their eyes I was an object that wasn't responding correctly to the narcissistic delirium they had in mind, embarrassing their inadequacy.
However, after a very short time, the area manager begins a toxic contact with me: she tells me that I am special, that she has been abused by all her exes, that she dreams of being a mother because her parents hate her.
In short, no trace of responsibility or desire to elaborate.
I only talk to her about Buddhism, and how to deal with some aspects of her suffering without, of course, making her feel that I have understood her predatory nature.
Nonetheless, after the first month and a half the tone with all the managers changes: dirty looks, gratuitous and humiliating teasing during meetings, and I am watched worse than a prisoner.
I put on a good face until it turns out that the predatory manager spread the news throughout the organization that I had harassed her, and that she narrowly escaped my clutches.
None of the people present contest the statement and I am denied the possibility of showing the Chats.
At that time I'm starting to date a wonderful girl: walks, coffee, good conversations and wonderful kisses.
Things seem to be going well, but she stops replying to me and blocks me from one day to the next, so I look for her on Instagram, where I find a photo with the psychopathic manager and the other co-responsible people.
To which I notice that, now that I know, they come looking for me more often to provoke me, snapping their fingers to call me back or whistling.
They are looking for reactive abuse, because they believe he is a troglodyte like them.

1mfl4cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetGripesAndGlor/comments/1mfl4cf/why_choose_drinkmate_omnifizz_soda_maker_for_your/,Why Choose DrinkMate OmniFizz Soda Maker for Your Kitchen?,"Testing out the DrinkMate OmniFizz 410-02-14Zx4 has been a fizzy adventure. As someone who loves experimenting with beverages, the idea of carbonating any drink was so exciting that I couldn't pass this up. This sparkling beverage maker promised a lot, and I was curious to see if it could live up to its claims. Equipped with proprietary Fizz Infuser technology, the device brought a refreshing twist to my daily drink routine.

**Functional Design And Ease Of Use**  
The OmniFizz strikes a nifty balance between utility and elegance. Its compact design means it doesn’t scream for attention in your kitchen, fitting next to my coffee machine snugly. The striking black matte finish adds a sleek look to the setup too. Setting it up required minimal effort. The manual operation might not cater to everyone, especially those used to fancy automated devices, but once you get the knack, it’s a breeze. The inclusion of a quick-connect reusable bottle was also an excellent touch—no need to hunt down additional accessories. 

**Highlights**  
- The ability to carbonate almost any liquid (yes, I tried carbonating my iced tea… success!)  
- Sleek matte black finish complements most modern kitchen aesthetics  
- Includes four CO2 cylinders, providing plenty of fizz power to get started  

[Check DrinkMate OmniFizz 410-02-14Zx4 price on Amazon.](https://kitchenchampions.com/p/b0cnq9rgq3/)

**Performance and Patented Features**  
Testing this out was the fun part. I started with sparkling water, moved to juices, and even gave flat cola a go. The unique Fizz Infuser system doesn’t just carbonate but also regulates pressure release. That means no fear of exploding your drink all over the kitchen wallpaper (trust me, I only tested this once by pressing at the wrong time). The ability to control how fizzy your drink gets using bursts of CO2 was a neat addition too. Still, don’t expect soda fountain levels of fizz, but it’s a solid middle ground.  

**Boons**  
- Supports sparkling virtually any liquid beyond water  
- Fizz Infuser ensures slow, controlled carbonation and mess-free operation  
- A CO2 set that’s generous enough to carbonate up to 240 liters of beverages  

**Downsides**  
- Manual setup might feel cumbersome to those who like push-button devices  
- While efficient, the carbonation level may not satisfy those craving extreme fizziness  
- Refilling CO2 cylinders can feel like a hassle if you don’t live near a supplier  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this with competitor models like popular soda makers on the market was intriguing. Unlike traditional water-only carbonators, the OmniFizz wins big for versatility in carbonating various liquids. Models from some rivals heavily lock in users with proprietary bottles or CO2 refills, which limits flexibility. The OmniFizz’s universal CO2 compatibility is refreshing, though lack of automation might turn off people opting for simplicity elsewhere. If you’re diving headfirst into crafting cocktails or re-carbonating pints of sparkling juice, this one’s way ahead. However, for anyone just wanting sparkling water, there are cheaper alternatives that might suffice.  

**Quality for Price**  
Evaluating its price-to-quality ratio, this drink-carbonating marvel hits a sweet spot for people who will use it frequently. The four CO2 cylinders bundled in basically eliminate starter costs for the first few months. Is it the most affordable option out there? No. But for someone like me, who gets a lot of joy experimenting with creative sparkling drink options, it’s worth splurging. Buying a $1.50 per can of seltzer versus crafting your mix and matching with juices quickly justifies itself.

Sylvie  thinks it's hilarious. She laughs in my head throughout lunch preparation. I'm just trying to erase the scene from my mind. I'm about to take the platters out to the dining room, George comes charging into the kitchen. He makes a beeline at me, grabbing me by the throat, and pinning me against the wall. He hauls back and punches me square in the face. The back of my head slams against the wall so hard I see stars. I can feel my nose is sour as I slide down the wall with a groan. ""You didn't see anything!"" He growls at me. I can feel his claws extending into my neck drawing blood, ""You understand, you little monster!"" I'm paralyzed with fear. I can't answer. I can't even nod. Suddenly I feel like I'm falling backward in my mind. I blink quickly a few times. It feels like I'm looking out of someone else's eyes. ""Let her go!"" The voice comes from me, but it isn't my voice. It's Sylvie. Her voice booms and sounds almost ethereal. The dishes on the counter shake as she growls deeply at George. I watch helplessly, as my hands glow violet and grab George's wrists. As I grab him, his eyes widen in fear and he starts howling in pain. A sizzling sound comes from where my hands connect with his skin. He quickly releases my neck and we both fall to the ground. ""How are you doing this? What are you, Talia?"" I stand up feeling much taller than my five-foot-tall frame. Sylvie’s voice booms from me, ""I'm a warrior child of the Moon Goddess. If you tell anyone what has happened here today, I WILL MAKE YOU SUFFER,"" Sylvie threatens. George scoots back on his backside away from me, wide-eyed, then clambers up and runs away as fast as he can. Suddenly, I come back into my normal state of mind and I fall back to the ground, exhausted. My hands are no longer glowing but they feel like they are on and full of static electricity. "" Sylvie! What was that?"" I scold her, but mostly because it scared me. ""I couldn't help it. He was threatening you."" ""Okay, but what was with the glowy purple, burnt hands thing?! That's not normal!"" ""Talia, we've been through this. You are a child of the Moon Goddess. You are special. There is more too. You will see after we shift for the first time. Until then, I'm not strong enough to show you. Besides, it isn't like I hurt him badly; his wolf will heal him before he is back in his office."" ""I-I don-, wait, you mean the Moon Goddess is my actual mom? Like she gave birth to me, specifically? Not just, like, mother of all werewolves because she created us a gazillion years ago?"" ""That's what I've been saying since I came. It's not my fault you didn't believe me."" I picked up a towel to wipe the stain from my nose. Sylvie  is already healing me from the break. But my face is going to be bruised for a couple of days. I pull my hat down low so no one can see the bruises then pick up the first two platters and rush out to the dining room. ""Okay, well if you're able to do that to George, how come you can't do it to Alpha Edward or Marcy?"" ""Well, I think it happened one time before, but I wasn't fully in control then. I can't do it now because he's your Alpha, Talia. I can't go against what he says. I can't attack your Alpha or his daughter."" ""Fine,"" I concede. I don't want to argue with her. I'm just trying to figure out the rules. I'm in uncharted territory here. I mean, it's cool territory but I don't know what our limits are. Once all the platters are out, I make the list of extra supplies I need and put it in the box hanging outside George's office. That way, I don't have to face him again. I clean up the dining room from lunch and still have about forty-five minutes until I need to start dinner. I decided to go to the stockroom and put supplies on the pantry cart for later. As I'm working, I hear someone clear their throat behind me. I look up to find Marcy standing uncomfortably close to me. ""Can I help you with something, Marcy?"" I try to swallow the panic that instantly builds in my throat. ""Talia, I just wanted to say, when I'm in control of the pack, you won't be treated the way you are now,"" she takes a step closer, forcing me to back up against the cart. ""Marcy, please stop,"" I put my hands up and push lightly against her to get her to move, but she's stronger than me and doesn't budge. I look up at her to see an evil grin distorting his face. ""I see the way my dad treats you, Talia. You never complain. You just take it,"" she moves closer, breathing deeply until she's fully pressing himself against me, ""I think you like when he does it. Don't you?"" he whispers in my ear. What?! There is no way I heard her right. Did I? ""Marcy, I do not enjoy what your father did to me,"" I say in disbelief, ""and you're no better, standing there watching him instead of stopping him.” I can feel tears stinging the corners of my eyes as she slips an arm around my waist. I cannot believe this is happening right now. ""Don't lie to me, Talia. I do like men, but I can’t deny your scent does something to me no man ever can. The way you beg before my father turns me on. It makes me crazy to think about what I'll do to you if I find you alone. I can't wait to get my hands on you. I want to hear you moan with pleasure when I am with you. I want you on your knees so I can whip you instead of him. I want you to be my toy, Talia, not his. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Bowing down to me with that pretty hairs in the air? We'll turn the dungeon into a playroom just for us, instead of just your bedroom,"" She's nuzzling against my neck right below my ear making me cringe, but I don't have anywhere to be able to move to get away from him. I can feel her fingers pressing against me, trying to make their way between my legs. ""Are you insane?"" I yell. I push hard against her but she's too strong. She doesn't budge, ""Get off of me, you sicko!"" This whole time, she's been turned on by watching her dad torture me? What is wrong with this family? The look on her face contorts from happy evil to disgusted. Without warning, she takes a step back. She elbows me in the back, dropping me onto the table. Then she bends over behind me, and whispers in my ears, ""I know you want me, Talia. Don't worry, you'll be mine as soon as I convince my father to let me have you. I want to make him proud when I make you squeal in pain but I don't think I can wait,"" Her voice is rough and ragged with excitement and her hands are all over me and groping me. All I can do is sob. I'm afraid to fight back or to even say anything. Sylvie  can't help me because she's the Alpha’s daughter. 'Moon Goddess, if you're my mother, please help me! Please save me from this!' I cry in my mind as Marcy bites my ears, gropes me and her hand runs all over me under my clothes. She pulls my leggings and underwear down, tearing them both in half with her wolf claws extended. I feel her pressing her fingers against my entrance. I know what was about to happen and I can't take it anymore. I turn my mind off. Just like her father beat me within an inch of my life. My mind cannot be present for what is happening to me. She finally gets off me and I fall to the floor. She tears the back of my shirt open and strikes with her claws on my back as if to mark me as her property. I lay on the floor of the supply room crying. ""Get up, Talia, "" Sylvie  commands in my mind. “I said get up,"" she repeats. Her voice is stern but caring, ""You're better than this. You will survive this."" ""I want to leave the world,  Sylvie . I can't do this anymore. I can't."" ""You can and you will. You will find your mate soon enough and things will change. I promise."" ""How can you be so sure?"" ""You will see. Glowy, burning hands are not your only gift."" I get up, find an old cardigan in the back of the stockroom, and put it on. I go back to my room to find new clothes before making dinner. The next four days go without incident. Unless you consider I have gone to the roof several times contemplating my existence. Each time, I stand with my toes at the edge and stare down from the four-story building. I can't bring myself to do anything except cry and go back to my room. I can't do it to  Sylvie . I can't take her life because I want to take mine. Sunday after dinner service, I see Luna Layla in the hallway while I'm refilling pantries. She quickly approaches me and grabs me by the arm. She extends her claws into my bicep, drawing blood. ""Talia, if you tell anyone and I mean anyone what you saw in George's office, I will make you suffer,"" she says in a low threatening tone. You too, lady? I'm fed up. Does she want to bully me? Okay, fine. I lift my hat and let my violet eyes look directly at her. She gasps at the unusual sight. ""Luna, it would be a relief and I would welcome it. You don't know or care how I'm treated by this pack. Including your husband, your daughter, and your lover, too,"" Tears choke up in my throat. I cannot take any more punishment or threats from anyone else. I'm at my wit's end. If she takes my life right here in this hallway, it would be a relief. ""I'm sorry,  Sylvie . I just can't do it anymore,"" I say to my angel as I'm staring down Luna Layla. She doesn't respond, she shuts our mind link and crawls into the corner of my mind. Luna Layla pushes me away, ""Insolent child! You should be grateful for your life! The Alpha will hear about this."" ""I'm not grateful for this life, Luna. And if you think I should be, you are part of the problem. If you want to tell the Alpha about this incident, I'm more than happy to tell him what instigated it."" She stares at me with pure anger and hatred before walking away without a word. I guess fate has other plans for me. I stand in the hall for a few minutes to see if she is coming back, but she doesn't. I'm certain she is going to sabotage me. Maybe she's going to smother me in my sleep or just stab me straight in the back. Either way, I was serious when I told her I welcome her. I finish pantry duty making sure everything is set in the guest rooms. I had George order bouquets for each of the suites as an extra touch. In the guest Alpha's suite, I also added a bottle of champagne. If this is the last thing I ever get to do, I want it to be something that makes someone else happy. It is almost one-thirty in the morning before I plop into my bed totally exhausted. It has been a day. If Luna Layla has anything to do with it, it will probably be my last. Sylvie  is exhausted too. She stops sulking long enough to tell me she needs me to shift, but I can't. I have no time or energy. I keep promising her I will, but I feel like I've broken that promise. I float off to the sounds of her whimpering in my head while I cry into the pillow. To my surprise, my alarm wakes me in the morning. Sylvie  makes me promise to hang on for one more day. We go through the motions of the life I hate. While I'm getting ready, I look in the mirror to find my hair is completely silvery now. I tuck it into a bun to try to avoid people noticing it. The delegation from Dark Howlers arrives in the early afternoon. They are all tall and intimidating with tattoos and big muscles. Some of them have visible scars on their arms and faces. They're wearing matching business clothes or security uniforms. Luna Layla directs them to the sitting room while I quietly bring in pitchers of water and ice tea for them to drink. I do my best to try not to be noticed when one of the women calls me out. ""You there, omega,"" She says abruptly. I look around and realize she is speaking to me. "" For everyone."" ""Maya, of course, right away,"" Luna Layla says quickly, then nods her head to me. I rush to the cellar and pull out two cases of napkins, and glasses, prepping the drink service cart and head back to the sitting room. I open three bottles, leaving the rest for them to do as they wish and I back out of the room so I can start preparing dinner. The rest of the day goes without a hitch. The guests seem pleased with dinner. In the evening, I go to each guest suite to make sure everyone is happy with their accommodations. A couple of people ask for more bags of chips or soda but on the whole, everyone seems satisfied. The last door is the Beta's room. Maya opens the door, looking much more relaxed than earlier. She has a large tattoo of a rose and a dagger on her forearm. Her dark hair is still pulled back but she isn't wearing makeup. I can see now, she looks only a few years older than me. I can hear her mate inside talking on the phone. ""Thanks for checking on us. Everything is wonderful. The flowers are a beautiful touch. You have good taste,"" she smiles at me. I bow to her slightly, then turn to leave. ""Wait, what's under your hat?"" I stop in my tracks and turn around. ""I'm sorry ma'am?"" I ask. I feel the blood drain from my face. ""Your hat. Why is it so low? What are you trying to hide?"" she asks, ""Come closer."" I come closer and slowly take off my hat. Keeping my eyes to the ground. My silver hair cascades down my back. It is embarrassingly greasy and visibly dirty. I feel myself blush. ""Oh, I see,"" she says with surprise in her voice, ""Now. Don't be disrespectful. Always look me in the eye when I speak to you."" I look up at her. The light from her room shines right into my eyes. She looks at me blankly for a moment trying to process what she is seeing. ""What are you? A hybrid?"" ""No, ma'am. The pack doctor did tests but doesn't know why it happened. He thinks it must be a transformation related to my wolf getting ready to wake up,"" I mean, it's not a lie...it's just not the whole truth, right? How am I supposed to tell a stranger that my wolf says I am the Moon Goddess's actual daughter and that is why I have silver hair and violet eyes? She grabs my chin and pulls my face closer to hers, inspecting closely, ""And does the pack doctor know someone has broken your nose recently? You still have bruises."" ""He's treated my injuries in the past,"" I'm not trying to elaborate or implicate anyone to this person I don’t know. ""Who's at the door, Maya?"" the Beta inside calls to her. ""Just the omega assigned to us, Caden. What's your name, again?"" ""It's Talia, ma'am but please call me Talia. I'm not an omega, though. I'm just a servant."" ""Her name is Talia. She picked out my beautiful flowers,"" she's still talking to her mate but she hasn't taken her eyes off me as if she is trying to size me up for some reason. Her brow furrows slightly as she stares. She's making me self-conscious. ""That's nice. Ask her if I can get bubbly water in the refrigerator."" ""No problem, ma'am,"" She and I share a smile at 'bubbly water', ""I will bring it shortly and leave it at the door.” ""Thank you. Oh and Talia, if those bruises aren't healed tomorrow morning, find some powder. Alpha Damon does not tolerate seeing injuries like that."" ""Ye-yes, ma'am."" I run to the stockroom, get four bottles of San Pellegrino, and put them in front of the door, then run away as fast as I can. One million questions run through my head. Would their Alpha be angry for being weaker than other wolves even if I was not part of his pack? Was she going to tell Alpha Edward about my unusual features? Was she going to call him out for letting someone break my nose? I mean, lady, if you think that is bad, I got some news you're not gonna like and then I'm dead meat by your Alpha for sure. Alpha Edward comes down later and whips me for not having all the items our guests wanted. By morning, Sylvie has still not been able to fully heal me. I’m in so much pain, everything is a struggle. Cooking, carrying breakfast trays, leaning over to clean tables. Every move causes scabs to open and bleed, making the back of my shirt damp with blood. Maya makes eye contact with me a couple of times. She can tell something was wrong but doesn't say anything. For some reason she can't explain, Sylvie is bouncing around in my head all morning. “The Beta is so nice! I can't wait to meet the Alpha and Luna!” “Sylvie , come on. We're not going to get to meet the Alpha and Luna. We're going to melt into the wallpaper and pretend we don't exist.” “I want to meet them.” “Okay, well I hate to disappoint you, but you're gonna get disappointed.” Layla comes in while I'm prepping lunch to let me know the Alpha has arrived and I need to make lunch for him as well. There is no Luna. He doesn't have a mate? And according to Layla...he's handsome. Not that it matters to me, because I'm going to be wallpaper. I don't want him to notice me at all. I take the trays to the conference room. Alpha Damon is not there but there is a spot at the table where he is supposed to sit. I leave his meal at the empty seat. Everyone from the Dark Howlers Pack politely thanks me as I lay plates in front of them. Their manners betray their intimidating features. No one from the Red Moon pack says a word to me as I serve them. I collect the trays and walk out quietly. Layla lets me know she will clean the plates so I can focus on dinner and food for the party. I go to the kitchen but need a minute to collect myself before I get started on dinner. I go out the back door and stand on the stoop. In the distance, I don't recognize him, it must be the Alpha from Dark Howlers. He is too far away for me to see his actual features though. All I can see is a tall figure with dark hair and a suit. It smells like but I swear it smells like coffee too...or dark chocolate. This guy was a mocha drinker? I laugh to myself at the thought of the big bad Alpha of Dark Howlers sipping on a mochaccino. I make a four-course meal of Caesar salad, bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizers, beef wellington with braised Brussels sprouts for the main dish, and a key lime pie for dessert. I also make bruschetta, tomato fritters, mini calzones, assorted veggie trays with dip, and chocolate truffles to serve for the party. I finished the desserts and veggie trays between breakfast and lunch so there was less for me to worry about now. I realize Sylvie 's advice of finding happiness in cooking has helped me enjoy making this dinner. Maybe because I'm serving people other than my pack or maybe it's because I'm making special food, not just the regular stuff I make for the pack? Either way, I don't mind my work today. I felt a sense of pride in it. There are servers for dinner service since it's a formal event. I stay in the kitchen and make sure everything is plated and going out the door in perfect condition. I'm in the zone, as they say. I peek out from the kitchen after each course is served. People seem to enjoy the food, which is a relief. I notice Alpha Edward is getting pretty drunk. Luna Layla keeps taking his glass away from him, but he keeps ordering the omegas to give him more. The dining room is extra crowded, so I don't get a better look at Alpha Damon. Maya sees me peeking out from the kitchen and gives me a wink and thumbs up. I smile and give a little wave before pulling my head back. I help the servers take the party food to the tables at the edges of the ballroom. I also make sure the bars in the corners are fully stocked. The DJ is finishing setting up and colorful lights are sliding across the floor. Party balloons and streamers are hanging all over the place. The first few guests are starting to wander in which is my cue to duck out the back door. Luckily, the dinner servers will clean up the dinner service tonight, which gives me extra time to restock pantries. I head upstairs to the stockroom and load the cart up. I'm humming to myself as I go from room to room. I feel an odd sense of calm as I go. ""You're in a good mood,"" Sylvie  says. ""I guess. I'm not sure why though. My back and feet still make me feel bad. "" ""Well, I'm happy that you're happy for once. This version of you is pretty cool."" ""Thanks,  Sylvie . You're not half bad yourself."" I finish stocking the ranked pack members' rooms on the fourth and third floors. Then head to the second floor where the guest suites are. The cleaning staff has cleaned the rooms and bathrooms. I just need to restock the toiletries, pantry items, and refrigerators. I make quick work of the rooms. I remember to stock the Betas' room with more bottles of San Pellegrino, refresh the flowers, and leave a little tent card with a handwritten smiley face on the kitchenette counter. It's almost midnight now, everyone is still in the ballroom partying. I close the door to the Betas' suite and move to the Alpha's suite door. It's the last room left for the. I know he must be at the party too, but I knock first just in case. I lean my ear against the door and don't hear a reply. I'm not sure if he has been in the room yet, but I need to check and make sure just in case it needs to be restocked. I slip the key card in the slot and open the door. From down the hall, I hear footsteps. ""Hey, you! What are you doing there?"" A gruff voice calls from down the hallway. I assume he's a security guard, so I start to reply that I'm part of housekeeping. I mean, I have a giant cart full of snacks and drinks. I'm also only five feet tall and not even eighty pounds. I don't know how much of a threat this guy thinks I could be. I look up from under my hat at two security guards walking quickly toward me. One of them is much bigger than the other. I notice he's dressed nicely for a security guard. He's the most handsome werewolf I've ever seen in my life. He's probably six-foot, six inches tall, and close to two hundred fifty pounds of solid muscle with broad shoulders. He has tattoos covering his neck and the backs of his hands. The smell of coffee and dark chocolate fills the air and I'm rooted to the spot. I slowly pull my hat up from my eyes just enough to get a better look at him. Sylvie  is jumping wildly in my head as he pushes past the guard, ""It's him! It's him!"" She and I say it at the same time, ""Mate."" He strides up to me and roughly pushes me against the door with a low growl. I don't think he realizes how light I am as I get slammed a bit too hard against the solid oak. He places both hands against the door on either side of my shoulders, preventing me from escaping. He puts his face against my neck and inhales deeply. My heart is pounding in my chest. I'm feeling overwhelmed and panic is settling in. He must sense that I'm weak. He's going to take me down before his Alpha gets a chance to do it. ""Alpha Damon, is this omega trying to steal something?"" The security guard says as he approaches. ""Get BACK!"" he snarls at the guard, flashing his large wolf fangs. The guard stops in his tracks. ""Alpha?"" the guard says with a confused look. Alpha? Wait, what? Alpha. This can't be right. ""MINE!"" Alpha Damon growls. My back is starting to feel wet. I'm bleeding a lot now. When he pushed me against the door, it pulled open most of the unhealed lash wounds. Now the initial adrenaline is wearing off and my back is starting to sting. The door behind my back feels slick. I try not to whimper. I don't want to show that I am weak. I didn't want him to hurt me when I just found him. Who am I kidding, there's no way he doesn't already know I'm a wimp. ""Talia, I can't heal you fast enough. Hang in there! The scars make it harder. I'm trying but I feel so weak!"" Sylvie  whimpers. She sounds far away. Over Alpha Damon's shoulder, I see Luna Layla and Alpha Edward running down the hall. Well, Alpha Edward is stumbling more than running. Beta Tony and Beta Caden and Maya are right behind them. My head starts swimming and I feel dizzy and nauseous. ""Talia, what did you do? You insolent, child!"" Luna Layla yells. Her voice sounds far away even though she is right in front of me now. She reaches out to do something bad to me but Alpha Damon snarls and grabs her hand out of the air snapping her wrist. Alpha Edward snarls back at him. My knees feel like jelly. I watch as if I'm in a dream. I can't hear anyone now even though they are all yelling. They look like they are moving in slow motion. Alpha Edward drunkenly yanks Luna Layla's arm pulling her back from Alpha Damon who is still snarling at them. The security guard is trying to separate them as Beta Tate is trying to pull Alpha Edward back. Beta Caden and Maya take a defensive stance guarding Alpha Damon. George comes up behind Alpha Edward just as he yanks on Luna Layla. She cries out in pain. George hauls back and punches Alpha Edward as hard as he can. I'm shaking all over. I can't feel Sylvie anymore. I look around, to see if anyone else notices the smell but they are all arguing with each other. I look down and realize blood is running down my legs and the door. Splashing onto the floor in large drips. I grip Alpha Damon's forearm. He looks back at me and his eyes widen. ""Help,"" I whisper. I feel myself sliding down the door.",1,1754121754.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

Garrett’s blue eyes darted up to the rearview mirror where he glared daggers at Val sitting in the backseat beside me. “You didn’t go back at the gas station like I told you to, did you?”

A pout appeared on her face as she turned a casual look out the window and twirled a lock of her red hair around her finger. I grinned while Garrett shook his head in exasperation. “But I didn’t *have* to go then, baby!” She said.

“It’s not about *having* to go, Val! You go so that we don’t have to stop later *fifteen minutes* down the damn road!”

Val rolled her eyes in my direction. I winked in an “I-Got’chu-Sis” manner, leaned forward, and placed my hand on my older brother’s shoulder. “You know what? I’ve got to go too, Garrett.”

“Of course you do!” He sighed, a tad bit more overdramatic than I would have thought appropriate. “Can you guys at least hold it until we come to the next rest stop or gas station?”

“Be happy to!” Val chirruped, with a sticky-sweet smile, and Garrett shook his head.

“We’re in BFE, though.” I warned her as I cut my gaze toward her. “It'll be a while before we find a rest stop or a truck stop.”

My brother’s tone was acidic when he spoke. “If you’re complaining, then I can pull over and the two of you can go piss in the woods? *Without* anything to wipe with. How’s that sound?”

Val frowned. She snapped her thin rubber bracelet against the inside of her wrist. “Would you really do that to me, baby? It’s almost dark out! And it’s *cold* outside!” She said. I nodded, sank back against the backseat, and folded my arms across my stomach. For extra measure, I propped my foot up on the seat in front of me and was rewarded with another glare from Garrett in the rearview mirror.

“He totally would,” I said. “Last year when we made this trip, Trinity and Eric forgot to go too. We traveled for over an *hour* to find a place and never did. They both kept complaining and finally, Garrett pulled over and told them to go behind a bush somewhere.” I paused before adding: “Garrett is hardcore when it comes to road trips.”

Val’s eyes narrowed. “Is that why they wanted to drive there on their own?”

There came a heavy silence from the front seat that spoke volumes. I nodded with another grin and mouthed to her: “Oh, yeah!”

Val dissolved into giggles as Garrett spoke sharply from the front seat. “It might happen again, you know. We’ve been on this stretch of road how many times before and never once come across one?”

I frowned. “Doesn’t the road look different to you this time, though?” I asked as I stared past the window into the night beyond. “I can’t put my finger on it, but it seems . . . *emptier*?”

He grinned. “What is it?” He asked. “Thinking about ghosts again?”

“What ghosts?” Val asked, curious, and I glared at my brother as I answered her.

“So, we’ve made this trip ever since we were kids, right?” I said, and Val nodded as she shifted against the seat to face me.

“Yeah, your yearly family road trip, right?”

“Yeah. It all started when our dad got the idea in his head that we needed to spend more time as a family and cooked up this idea that we didn’t take enough family vacations together. So, Mom found this cheap place under three hours away that offered scenic views, mom-and-pop restaurants, and—more importantly—”

“Free state parks!” Garrett and I chimed in unison before we collapsed into twin peals of laughter that gradually died so I could finish the story.

“Well, Dad died a few years ago—heart attack—and when he died, Mom said she was *done* with family vacations. She was never a big fan of the town we go to. You spend every year for over eighteen years going to the same restaurants and visiting the same tourist traps over and over again and, well, hey, look, I don’t blame her, okay? But the place has . . . sentimental value to Garrett and me. So, we still go, and we take our friends and partners with us, hence, you, Trinity, and Eric.”

“Okay,” Val laughed as she looked between me and Garrett. “What do ghosts have to do with this?”

“So, I’ve always hated this road,” I said. “It’s always been creepy to me. I can’t explain why. It’s just . . . that little lizard part of my brain *hates* this road. And, well, okay, promise you won’t laugh?”

Val nodded, solemn, and stuck out her pinkie to me, outstretched. “Pinky-swear!”

I shook my head and grinned as I looped my pinky with hers. “It was like, our fifth year of driving this road as a family. Garrett and Mom were passed out, so it was just Dad and me still awake. I was trying to read a book by flashlight. It was as dark as it is now outside, and I thought . . . well, I *thought* I saw someone walk into the street ahead of us.”

Val’s eyes widened.

“I screamed at Dad to look out, that he was going to hit whoever had walked out onto the road in front of us, but all he did was wince and yell at me not to scream in his ear — that there was no one on the road. And when I looked . . . there was no one there.”

Garrett grinned at us in the rearview mirror. “Lainie and her Ghost,” he said. “So, whenever we turn off onto this road, I always have to give her shit about seeing things that aren’t there.” He laughed and shook his head. “*Man*, do you remember how *pissed* at you Dad was --!”

“Oh, look!” Val interrupted him. “There’s a rest stop!”

With one hand on the back of the front passenger seat, Val pulled herself forward. Through the window, she pointed out the rundown cluster of buildings in the distance swiftly approaching us. By all appearances, it *looked* like a rest stop. Like every other one scattered across the United States. Garrett frowned while I sat there in uneasy silence.

“It . . . looks kinda rundown, babe.” He said as he brought the car down to coasting speed. He glanced at her over his shoulder. “Are you sure you want to stop here?”

She nodded, with a stubborn tilt to her chin. “You bet I do! It looks like it has bathrooms. The lights in the parking lot are on, too. Whatever it is, it beats having to go in the woods!”

My gaze crossed with Garrett’s in the rearview mirror. Twin looks of uncertainty. My hands clasped tight in my lap. “What do you think, Lainie?” He asked.

I didn’t answer as Garrett brought the car to a full stop in the middle of the unsettlingly deserted road. We sat at the turnoff point of the one-way road that wound into the rest stop’s parking lot.

The rest stop’s *empty* parking lot.

Alarm bells clanged in my head. Something wasn’t right. Garrett and I had been on countless road trips since we were kids. We had seen countless state rest stops all across the country. No matter where, no matter what time, their parking lots were always full. Campers, RVs, and idling sixteen-wheelers. That didn’t include all the families in minivans. Those with excited golden retrievers pulling on leashes, who had stopped to get snacks from the vending machines and to take restroom breaks. Rest stops were never *deserted*. Not like this one was. Neither did they ever look so run down. This one looked like it hadn’t seen a visitor in, well . . . *years*. Decades, even.

Which also made little sense. I couldn’t count the number of times we’d driven this road in our lifetimes, and *never* had we seen a rest stop here. Yeah, I suppose it could have been built within a year, but to also be *abandoned* within that same calendar year? It seemed too preposterous. Not even mishandled state funds were mismanaged to that degree.

I opened my mouth to reply — to tell him to keep driving, that didn’t this *reek* to him —but I didn’t get the chance. Val, with her incessant hopping up and down in the seat next to me, silenced me. Her teeth sank into her bottom lip as she pinned a pleading look onto Garrett.

“*Please,* baby? I’ve *got to go*!”

Garrett gave me an apologetic look through the mirror. He coasted the car forward and turned off down the one-lane road to the rest stop’s parking lot. The din of alarm bells in my head resounded louder and clearer as we approached the shabby buildings. They rose to a crashing crescendo when we came to a stop before swan-diving into my stomach.

My stomach hurt. It twisted with anxiety. Fear leaked in like a sieve, creating a swirling maelstrom within my head. This wasn’t right. Something was wrong. We shouldn’t be here.

*We shouldn’t be here*.

I voiced the sentiment to Garrett through what felt like numb lips. Val threw the door open as soon as the car stopped. We sat there and watched as she power-walked towards the rest stop. The car door remained open behind her. She hadn’t even bothered to close it.

“Didn’t you hear me, Garrett?” I asked, feeling anxiety seeping into my pores and out through the tone of my voice. “We shouldn’t be here! Don’t you feel it? Jesus, look around! When was the last time you saw a rest stop completely empty?” I drew a deep breath that shuddered in my lungs. “And how many times have we driven this road before? Do you ever remember there being a rest stop here?”

“Never. But there *has* to be a logical reason.” Garrett said. He swallowed as another apologetic look crossed his face. “And look, Val’s already out of the car. Do *you* want to wrangle her back in before she has a chance to go to the damn bathroom?” He shook his head. “Let’s just go, okay? We’ll keep an eye out. The *slightest* creepy thing happens, and we’ll beat feet out of here.” He smiled and held his pinky out to me. “Pinky-swear?”

I sighed and nodded, scooting forward to loop my pinky with his. “Yeah. Okay. Pinky-swear. But let’s *hurry*, okay?”

He nodded, opened his door, and then stepped out. He shut it behind him, walked around the car, and took off after his girlfriend. I watched him go before exiting the car myself. Call me crazy, but I did *not* want to be alone for any length of time in this creepy place.

I looked down at my feet. Cracked asphalt lay beneath the soles of my shoes, like it hadn’t seen maintenance in ages. My gaze swept the parking lot, revealing missing chunks in some areas, leaving gouges of dark earth behind. Weeds poked up everywhere through the cracks — dandelions and tall grasses. The surrounding forest encroached upon the parking lot’s edges, and close to where we had parked was another, smaller building. I could see the lights of vending machines flickering inside.

My nose wrinkled. This place *stank* of abandonment. Who knew the last time someone had stocked those vending machines and checked the expiration dates? The thing that scared me the most, though, was that we *still* hadn’t seen another car pass by on the road. All our past trips driving this road — while not a highway—had, even so, remained busy. It hadn’t at all been this deserted or ominous.

“Lainie, come on!” Val yelled, waving a hand through the air. “The bathroom’s over here!”

My stomach twisted again as I turned and made my way over to them. My Chuck Taylors slapped against the broken sidewalk. They stood in front of an open door. A sign with the black-lettered word “Restroom” sat above it. An almost sickly yellow light shone from within. Garrett leaned inside as I joined them, hands braced against the doorframe, as if he suspected ghosts or deranged psychopaths lurked inside. Finding it empty, he withdrew with a grimace.

“Well . . . it’s not the cleanest restroom in the world. Not that we expected much from the state of this place.” He looked at me and shrugged. “We’ve been in Shell Station restrooms—this isn’t that much worse.”

“Is it unisex?” Val asked before she added, “I didn’t see separate rooms for men and women.”

“It looks like it’s the only one, but it has three stalls, so we should be fine.” The grimace returned to his face. “Just . . . don’t get cut on any rusted metal, okay? You don’t want to get tetanus — not in this shithole.”

He turned back to the bathroom and led us inside. The sickly yellow light beamed down from the two lights overhead. They hung suspended from cobwebby chains on opposite sides of the room, and someone had covered both lightbulbs in wire mesh cages. A faint buzzing came from both. Moths and gnats swirled in tornadoes around them.

The black and white tiled floor was grimy, sticky against our shoes, and disgusting to look upon. The walls seemed to match, and I did *not* want to know what was on the walls to give them the same appearance as the floor. Caked with filth, the sinks had rings of deep copper-colored rust that encircled the drains.

Something had cracked the mirror on the farthest side of the room in three different places. The one in the middle had been shattered, with the shards filling the sink beneath it. The one closest to them was fine, if in desperate need of a cleaning. Vagrants and hoodlums had painted the stalls head-to-toe in indecipherable graffiti.

Garrett approached the farthest stall, looked inside, and shrugged. The light from above reflected off his glasses.

“At least the toilets don’t look half bad.”

Val approached the middle stall, which left me with the one closest to the door. I peered inside and saw Garrett had been right. The restroom itself looked like its previous owner had been a deranged meth head, one who had used it to cook in, but the toilets themselves were spotless. White, pristine, and oddly . . . *inviting*.

We glanced at each other, uneasy, before Val shrugged and disappeared into the middle stall. The door swung shut and locked behind her. Garrett followed suit. He disappeared into the far stall without a word. I stood in front of mine as anxiety continued to curdle in my stomach. Though the alarm bells remained silent, they lurked at the edges of my mind, prepared at any moment to come clanging back in like hell’s own marching band.

The spotless toilet didn’t help. Either the owners of the rest stop believed in having Mr. Clean-approved toilets despite the surroundings appearing as if a shit bomb had gone off, or . . . something else was off. I felt a sudden, instinctive urge to flee but didn’t want to leave my brother and best friend behind. Against my better judgment and my skittish lizard brain, I entered the stall.

The tiny space was dark and claustrophobic , almost as if the yellow light couldn’t penetrate over the top of the stall door. I locked it behind me before I pulled down my jeans and underwear and planted my ass on that pristine toilet seat. I hadn’t realized how much I had needed to go before I sat down. Val hummed in the stall next to me, something cheerful and happy. I felt my guard lower.

Until I heard the footsteps.

I first heard them on the asphalt outside, approaching the bathroom at a steady but leisurely clip. My heart jumped up into my throat as I heard them grow closer. We hadn’t closed the restroom door behind us. Neither had we checked whether the door had a lock. Why should we have? We hadn’t seen another car for miles since we had left the last gas station. For all we knew, we were the only ones there.

“Garrett?” I asked as my voice trembled. I heard him release a sound of acknowledgment that accompanied the zipping up of his jeans. “Garrett, do you hear that?”

Val’s humming came to an abrupt stop when my words reached her. Only the sound of approaching footsteps and the buzz of the overhead lights filled the room. “Are those . . . footsteps?” Val asked. Apprehension had leaked into her tone. Garrett released another sound, this one of uncertainty.

“Yeah, they are. One second, I’ll let them know we’re—*hey*! What the hell?”

I heard the door of his stall rattle on its hinges without opening, and my heart rate gave a sharp spike.

“What? Garrett, what is it?” I asked. I could hear the bewilderment in his voice as he answered me. His stall door continued to rattle.

“My . . . the stall door's stuck. What the hell? It won’t fucking open!”

The steps grew closer. Their sound changed as the gravelly asphalt ended and met the smooth gray cement of the sidewalk leading up to the bathroom. Fear edged into Val’s voice as she spoke, yet she masked it well. The only reason I could hear the fear was because I felt it, too. It was as keen as the edge of a blade digging into my side.

“Give me a second, maybe mine . . .?” I glanced down and saw her rise to her feet. The elastic in her panties snapped against her skin as she pulled them up along with her jeans. Her door rattled, and when it didn’t open, she no longer tried to mask the fear in her voice. “Oh, my God . . . oh, my God, Garrett—*guys*—my door won’t open, either!”

I released a terror-filled moan, my bladder drying up in fear. I tried to get up but found myself pinned to the seat, unable to move. Val’s voice grew louder, sharper. Garrett’s stall door continued to rattle, violently now, in his desire to free himself. There came a couple of loud bangs as he attempted to kick it open. As if held in place by a supernatural force, the stall door remained closed and locked. The sharp scent of fear entered the air. What hellish trap did we walk into?

The strange footsteps paused when they reached the open bathroom door. Val’s voice dried up while Garrett ceased trying to force open his door.

That’s when I realized *why* the stalls were so dark.

The stall doors were longer than usual in other public restrooms. Most other restrooms had a good foot, foot and a half, of free space beneath them. These doors, though, only had about half a foot. I couldn’t see the feet those footsteps belonged to, but I *could* see the slight darkening of a shadow on the other side of the door. Ominous and foreboding — why were they standing there and not saying anything?

Silence reigned for several long, excruciating minutes. My senses strained to detect the slightest auditory change. Then, the footsteps resumed. They echoed against the tiles as whoever had joined us made their *slow* way across the bathroom. Shadows bled under the door of my stall in a pool before continuing to the right. Did someone need the sink? I found my hopes dashed when they continued past Val in the middle stall to stop by what I thought was the far stall — Garrett’s stall. The blood rushed through my ears. I could feel how hard my heart was pounding.

“Hey, man, could you help us out?” Garrett said, half-joking, half-uncertain, in the tone of someone who was not at all sure if he was in a dangerous situation or not. “Somehow, the locks on our doors are jammed. We can’t get out.”

Silence lingered again. Then a voice, high and child-like, filled the restroom.

“Red paper? Or blue paper?”

There was a confused pause during which I could envision Garrett’s look of utter befuddlement in my head. I’d seen it so many times growing up. “W . . . what are you talking about, man?”

The high, child-like voice came again, filled with infinite patience. “Red paper? Or blue paper?”

“Garrett, what’s going on?” Val asked, her voice echoing with fear and confusion. Garrett released a bewildered laugh.

“I don’t know --”

“Red paper? Or blue paper?”

Impatience tinged the words this time. The words trailed down my skin like nails.

I shook my head, my eyes wide with fear. The alarm bells were back now, echoing like the tolling of church bells in my head. My stomach twisted almost violently. “Garrett, don’t answer --”

A loud bang on the far stall door interrupted me and made me jump. The voice, still child-like, was rendered darker and deeper, like the child was angry now it wasn’t getting what it wanted. A child who spat the words through tight, gritted teeth.

“*Red* paper! Or *blue* paper?”

“Babe, I don’t know what --!”

“Garrett! Listen to me! *Don’t* answer it!”

“Guys, calm the fuck down! I can’t think --” Another slam reverberated over his stall door, causing him to release a yelp and a hurried: “*Fine*! Red paper—red paper!”

Another silence followed. A childish giggle of glee filled the air. It rose until it felt like the sound was booming across the walls—echoing in my very bone marrow. Then, it ended, and a tremendous ‘BANG’ split the air. I jumped again as Garrett released a scream of terrified shock. Whoever the footsteps and the voice belonged to had kicked in the stall door. A violent struggle erupted. Grunts and bangs from bodies slamming against the walls of the stall. Then there was a tremendous crash as something heavy hit the toilet and broke it. The sound of spurting water hitting tile filled the air along with the sound of pained yelps and wheezes. Then, came the steady, rhythmic sounds of soft, wet, fleshy sounding ‘schunks’. From within the stall beside me, I heard Val sobbing to herself. I was shaking. *What* was happening?

After a moment, every sound stopped except for the water fountaining into the air. Then the footsteps came again. They left the stall, and when Val, in a tenebrous whisper, called Garrett’s name, he didn’t respond.

The footsteps echoed off the tile floor and came to a stop in front of the middle stall. Val’s stall. Her sobs picked up again, little moaning no’s spilling from her mouth. The voice came again, no longer childlike as it had with Garrett, but amused and demonic. The deep baritone sound of a massive man.

“Red paper? Or blue paper?”

“Val, don’t answer.” I said as quietly as I dared and hoped she could hear me and that the . . . *being* couldn’t. I could sense her rocking back and forth — I could *hear* the toilet seat below her creak with her shifting weight. “Val, honey, can you hear me?”

“*Please*!” she said, the last seconds of the plea breaking off into a racking sob. “What did you do to Garrett? Why isn’t he answering us?”

“Red paper? Or blue paper?”

Val didn’t answer. She continued to sob. I tried calling her name again, louder this time, pleading with her not to answer him, to stay silent or to keep sobbing. My heart sank when I heard her next words.

“Blue. Blue, blue, *blue*! Just let me go. I don’t want to play your game—*let me go*!”

The being paused before it exhaled a massive sigh of disappointment. Then, the deep male voice came again, exasperated and disappointed. “*Man*. The women *always* choose blue.”

I had only seconds to think about what these words meant. A gunshot-like bang announced the kick that hurled open Val’s stall door, echoing Garrett’s. Val shrieked and flew into a flurry of pleas for the being to spare her. I remained frozen to the toilet I was sitting on. I called for her, cursed whoever was doing this, and hurled as many expletives as I could. My fists banged on the stall wall that divided us as another struggle erupted. The sound of strangled gasps filled the air. Hands slapped against something that sounded frighteningly solid.

My actions ceased as the need to fight drained from my body when I realized those sounds meant Val was being strangled to death. The sharp, acrid tang of fear filled my mouth. Whoever this was, was killing us. It had killed Garrett, and it was now killing Val. Next, it would try to kill me, and for what? A *game*?

If that’s what you could call it.

The sounds of struggle faded. Something struck the toilet seat with a thud. My eyes closed as my body heaved with dry, silent sobs. That was Val hitting that toilet seat. Val’s dead body.

The footsteps came sooner than they had after killing Garrett. They stopped at my door. There was a moment of silence before the voice spoke again, not child-like and not with the sound of a man’s voice, but with a woman’s this time. It spoke with sickening glee, the voice lilting and silken, with the slightest twang of a Southern drawl.

“Red paper? Or blue paper?”

I shook my head, trying to get myself under control. “Why? Why are you *doing* this?”

There was no answer from the being beyond the stall door, and I released a scoffing laugh. I didn’t know what I had expected. Was it to unleash a long diatribe describing the reason it played this cruel game? Did I expect a detailed explanation of why it asked red paper or blue paper before killing whoever it spoke the question to? In the end, I didn’t need to have an answer—I already *knew* the answer: just because. Because we were *there*. Because of something as simple and stupid as pure, random, dumb luck.

A teasing, echoing rap on the door echoed in the restroom, and that sound frightened me more than the banging had. The voice was of someone amused. Gleeful. It had slain twice that night, and it would strike again. It had glutted itself on Garrett and Val. With me, it was content to toy with its food.

“Red paper? Or blue paper?”

I shook my head, beyond defeated, beyond terrified. I was about to die, and I knew it. Acceptance flooded into me along with an anger I hadn’t expected to feel. Anger for Garrett, anger for Val, anger for me. My jaw hardened, my teeth gritted. You know what? *Fuck* this guy!

*Fuck*.

This.

Guy!

“You know what?” I asked with a self-deprecating laugh. “Go fuck yourself. Fuck off! I want neither, okay? You can take your red paper and your blue paper and *shove them up your ass*! I don’t want any of it!”

Absolute stillness filled the room. Once more, the buzzing of the overhead lights and the spurting water in the far stall were the only sounds in the room. No bangs heralded the throwing open of the stall door. There was no intense struggle for life against a monster I couldn’t describe. I could see the being’s shadow as it stood still beyond the stall door. It said nothing, and as far as I know, it made no further movement towards my stall.

It was a tense moment.

Every muscle in my body was taut in preparation for a fight for my life or an attempted flight for the same. Then, my stall door’s lock released with a tiny click. My heart jumped up into my throat, and for a moment, I thought I would vomit. Sublime relief flooded me when the footsteps left and made for the bathroom’s open door. The sweetness surpassed any I’d known, but bitterness also suffused it, and I recognized its taste. I knew why it tasted so good and so bitter at the same time. It was the taste of life. The taste of having survived something heinous and unthinkable when others hadn’t.

As I waited, the footsteps walked down the sidewalk, and I held my breath. I heard the change in them as they hit the asphalt and waited longer still as they grew farther and farther away. I waited until I couldn’t hear them anymore, even when I strained myself. Then, I could finally move.

Jumping to my feet, I pulled my underwear and jeans up before lunging out of the stall. Whirling around towards the open doorway, I saw nothing amiss. A glance outside showed the place still deserted, parking lot and all. I turned back to the interior of the restroom and felt my heartbeat in my throat again. Both stall doors had been flung open and hung now, askew, on broken hinges. From the farthest stall, there was a growing pool of blood, diluted by the spraying water from the broken toilet. Red clashed with the sickly yellow light from above and the black-and-white checkered floor below.

I didn’t want to, but I forced myself to approach the pool of blood. I forced myself not to look into the shadowed stall where Val’s strangled body rested, blue, with bulging eyes and a swollen tongue. Reaching the far stall, I peered inside, tears already blurring my vision. I saw Garrett’s slumped over corpse in front of the toilet. My big brother. The first friend I ever had. The little boy who used to let me read Batman comics with him under the sheets of his bed with a flashlight when our parents arguing kept us awake at night as kids. I barely recognized him.

Someone—the *being —* had slashed his throat with such viciousness that his head had been almost severed from his body. His torso looked like someone had stabbed him, over and over again, and with so much violence and force it resembled raw hamburger meat. He sat slumped against the stall wall on the floor, the broken pieces of the toilet underneath him, his body drenched with blood and the water from the spewing toilet behind him. His broken glasses sat askew on his nose, and I felt the overwhelming urge to straighten them before I stopped myself.

I stopped because I had heard someone screaming in the distance. It took a long, long moment for me to realize that the screams were coming from me. When I realized this, my vision narrowed.

Then, utter blackness claimed me.

\*\*\*\*

I don’t know how I got out of there or what pulled me out of that hell, but I awoke in a county hospital a few days later. When they discovered I had finally woken up, nurses and doctors swarmed me. They fired question after question: how did I feel, did I hurt anywhere, what did I remember? I answered what I could, enough to calm them down, until I could ask what had happened to me — how I had ended up there. They were skeptical, not knowing a lot themselves, but filled me in with what they knew. Which wasn’t a lot.

They told me a police cruiser had found me wandering delirious down a back country road and brought me in. Initially, they had put me on psyche hold because I had been sobbing and crying about paper and my brother and best friend being killed and wouldn’t stop until they knocked me out. I nodded, remembering that much at least, before I asked if they had found Val and Garrett. The nurses and doctors shook their heads in sympathy and said they knew nothing else. There was no one registered in the hospital going by Val or Garret’s name. They posited that perhaps the police knew something. They wanted to ask me some questions when I was ready.

The two detectives I spoke to, Detective Stone and Detective Irving, weren’t much help either when I finally got around to giving them my statement of what had happened. I wasn’t surprised when their behavior turned out to be more antagonistic than helpful. They were convinced I was on some drug before what they labeled as “The Accident” happened. What the accident was, they couldn’t say. They were willing to humor me when I begged them to recover the bodies from the rest stop, but only because they had a potential murder case on their hands. When I begged for them to catch the asshole who had killed my brother and best friend, they said they’d do their best.

They humored me at first. After a while, though, as the days went by and no one had found either Val or Garrett, they grew irritated. Especially when I kept saying that all they needed to do was find the rest stop.

After a few days, Trinity and Eric found me in the hospital, worried and frantic. Trinity bawled into my shoulder as she wrapped her arms around me and hugged me hard enough she almost squeezed the life out of me. Eric, Garrett’s friend since high school, just looked sad. Haunted. When Trinity left one afternoon to get snacks from the vending machine down the hall, he sat in the chair and held my hand as he confessed he wished he’d been there. If he had been with us, then perhaps he could have persuaded Val to use the restroom at the gas station, or he could have kept watch at the rest stop or helped Garrett fight off the people that had killed them.

I didn’t know what to tell him to make him feel better. You could not convince me to believe that the being could be stopped, and I believe it was a being. Not three different people, not a singular man, woman, or child, but a *being*. I had heard only one pair of footsteps the entire time, after all, not three.

Trinity and Eric stayed until a nurse stopped by to tell me that Detective Stone was back and that he wanted to ask more questions. My friends excused themselves and said they’d be back later after they had booked a hotel room to stay in while I got better. As they left, Detective Stone slipped in, smelling of cheap instant coffee and cigarette smoke.

This would mark my fifth round of interviews with Detective Stone. It began as it usually did, with him asking me how I felt. After I told him I felt as good as could be, given the circumstances, we started with the same questions he always asked, and I answered them in the same way I had the past four times. Not a note in my story had changed, and by the time we finished, I could tell Detective Stone had had enough rest stop talk.

He shook his head as he held up a hand. “Stop, Miss. Baker, just *stop*! At this point, it seems like all you’re doing is sending me and my guys on a wild goose chase. We’ve found nothing to suggest that someone murdered your brother and his girlfriend. Hell, at this point, we’re wondering if you even *have* a brother!”

I shook my head, bewildered. “I don’t understand,” I said. “How could you not have found them by now? Their bodies are at the rest stop!”

“The rest stop?” He asked, brow cocked, and I nodded. Reaching into the inner pocket of his blazer, he withdrew his notepad. Flipping it open, he read what he had scribbled inside. “They’re at the abandoned rest stop about fifteen minutes from the Marathon Gas Station, the one on Shoehorn Road coming south from Unionville. Is that correct?”

I nodded, and he shook his head as he closed the notepad and tucked it back into it's pocket. He gave a dark chuckle, even as his gaze adopted an uncertain note. “Quite frankly, Miss. Baker, it’s flat out *impossible* that you’ve been at that rest stop. Let alone that some psycho murdered your brother and his girlfriend there a few days ago.”

“And why is that?” I asked, not bothering to hide my frustration. The police weren’t the only ones frustrated at having had no answers so far.

He sighed and crossed his arms. “The state demolished that rest stop three years ago, not long after the Marathon Gas Station opened. The official story was that there was no need for it.”

“Why did they shut it down?” I asked, confused. “The Marathon station might be fifteen minutes away, but it’s another thirty, tops, to the next --”

Detective Stone held up another silencing hand. I stopped talking as he looked away, staring at a spot on the far wall. He appeared deep in thought. Haunted, almost like how Eric had appeared haunted.

“That rest stop had a dark past,” he said. “While it was being built, we kept getting phone calls from mediums about how the land was ‘sour’. That nothing should be built there; it should be *left alone*.” He shrugged. “The calls went ignored. People said it was just some old bat somewhere bored with her soap operas and angry her kids didn’t come visit her anymore.”

“But something happened, right?” I asked, feeling anxious again but not knowing why. My hands twisted around the blanket in my lap. “Something *had* to have happened for the state to tear it down.”

He drew in a deep breath. “Miss. Baker, I’ve been on the force for, oh . . . thirty years now, give or take a year or two, and I’ve never regretted it. The town’s small, and it’s quiet for the most part. The worst we have to deal with is people breaking the speed limit and the occasional DUI. Except for ’99. ’99 was a bad year.”

“Why’s that?”

“’99 was the year they tore down that rest stop after it became the scene of a string of brutal murders, all occurring in the restroom. The first case involved three women, all strangled. Second was two men and a woman; the men were stabbed, the woman strangled. The last case before the state shut it down and bulldozed the place was a family: a husband, a wife, and their eight-year-old son. It was the most brutal yet. The husband had been stabbed and his throat cut, and his wife and child strangled.”

I felt icy cold, like someone had just breathed down my neck. I swallowed hard as my flesh broke out in the worst case of goosebumps I’d ever experienced. “Did they ever catch the person who did it?” I asked, breathless and terrified, and after a moment, he shook his head.

“Nope. Never caught the guy. When the rest stop was bulldozed, the killings stopped. But depending on who you ask, the land remains sour, and the state has yet to do anything with it. Some consider it a blessing. To this day, though, it remains an open case.” He paused, and his eyes narrowed as he looked at me. “Do you understand, Miss. Baker, why I keep visiting you like this — why I can’t believe your story? Your being at that rest stop with your brother and your brother’s girlfriend is *impossible*!”

But yet we had been, I thought. Somehow.

Not long after that interview, the detective informed me that our interviews were done. He had no further questions for me. Relieved, I was discharged from the hospital not long after. Trinity and Eric picked me up, ready to take me home to a grieving mother and the empty space in our lives that Garrett used to fill.

“I’m not looking forward to going back,” I said as Trinity helped me gather my things together. “I don’t know how I’m going to face Mom. What I’m going to tell her. Or what I’m gonna tell Val’s parents.”

“We’ll be with you, sweetie,” Trinity said, her presence soothing and comforting. I shared a tearful smile with her as Eric stepped into the room from the connecting bathroom, my toiletries in his arms, which he deposited on the bed by my backpack. As they scattered across the surface of the hospital bed, something caught my eye. Buried beneath a shampoo bottle and my Ziplock baggie of pads, lay something. Reaching over, I moved things aside, only to clap a shaking hand to my mouth in horror.

On the bedspread sat a piece of paper sliced in half along the diagonal with a thick black Sharpie line.

Basically about 3 years ago I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and I think for about 3/4 years it was hell even before that. My anxiety shows up in a lot of way but the main is nausea and then I can’t eat so I get anxious about not eating and passing out etc. I also struggle a lot with rumination I go on and on about the same minor issue in my head it’s terrible. Anyway with the help of my therapist doctor and friends I got better about a year ago and I think for about 8 month I had no anxiety at all, even for stressful event like taking a train or whatever used to stress me out. But about 2 weeks ago I started feeling agitated again. It started as feeling a bit nervous to totally anxious, I had a very bad panic attack last week, probably the worst I ever had. I believe it’s partly bc I really didn’t took care of my nervous system I went out a lot drank a loooot of coffee bc of work, I didn’t slept a lot etc. Also I had pretty bad work problems like terrible boss a lot of working hours etc. I quit my job this week bc I am moving on to something better so I should feel free and happy to do something better but for some reasons my anxiety keep getting worse every day. Is it slowly going to go away or do I need to get back on medication ? Does anyone has already went through a « setback » ?(don’t know the word sorry English isn’t my first language).

You are sitting at your desk, coffee in hand, scanning through dozens of business school tabs. One promises global exposure. Another shows that they are flexible for working professionals. A third one focuses on finance specialisation. Suddenly, you pause and wonder:

**“What are the top private MBA colleges in India?”**

And more importantly, which type of MBA should you opt for? 

You are not alone at that moment of decision-making. Let us break it down and explore the options. 

# Why It Matters: Choosing the Right Type of MBA

An MBA is more than a degree — it is nothing but a turning point. If you wish to climb the corporate ladder, switch industries, and become an entrepreneur, your MBA needs to fit the journey.

# Specialised MBAs: For Focused Career Goals

Eager to know about what you love already? Specialised MBAs in areas like finance, marketing, HR, business analytics and even healthcare or sustainability are becoming increasingly popular.

## Key Features Analysis

The current generation of clear water bottles boasts advancements that extend beyond simple hydration. From innovative materials to clever design elements, these features distinguish the best options.
**Material Transparency and Durability**

The primary advantage of a clear water bottle is, naturally, its transparency. This allows users to easily monitor water levels and visually assess the cleanliness of the bottle. However,transparency shouldn't come at the expense of durability. Tritan is a prevalent material, known for its impact resistance, BPA-free composition, and glass-like clarity. Other materials, such as borosilicate glass, offer superior durability and are resistant to thermal shock, making them suitable for both hot and cold beverages.
**Leak-Proof Lid Design**

A reliable, leak-proof lid is paramount for any water bottle, especially for those constantly on the go. Many bottles now feature double-sealing mechanisms, utilizing silicone gaskets and robust locking systems to prevent spills and leaks.These designs are rigorously tested to withstand pressure changes,ensuring contents stay contained even during travel or vigorous activities. Look for lids with easy-to-use opening mechanisms and secure closures.
**Ergonomic Design and Grip**

Beyond functionality, comfort plays a important role in the user experience. Ergonomically designed bottles fit comfortably in the hand, reducing fatigue during extended use.Some incorporate textured surfaces or silicone sleeves to enhance grip, particularly beneficial during workouts or outdoor adventures where sweaty hands can compromise control. Consider the shape and size to ensure it fits seamlessly into your daily routine.
**Wide mouth Opening**

A wide mouth opening facilitates easy filling and cleaning. This design allows for larger ice cubes and easier addition of fruit or other flavor enhancers. It also simplifies the cleaning process, enabling users to thoroughly scrub the interior and prevent the buildup of bacteria or residue. Some bottles feature rounded edges around the opening to ensure cozy drinking without sharp edges.
**Temperature Retention (Optional)**

while not all clear water bottles are insulated, some models offer double-walled construction to maintain beverage temperature. These bottles often utilize vacuum insulation technology, which minimizes heat transfer and keeps drinks cold for up to 24 hours or hot for several hours. This feature is particularly valuable for those who prefer to enjoy their water, iced tea, or coffee at a consistent temperature throughout the day.

Key features of the best clear water bottles in 2025 include:

*   High-durability, BPA-free materials
*   Guaranteed leak-proof lid design
*   Ergonomic, comfortable grip
*   wide mouth for filling and cleaning
*   Optional temperature retention technologies

## core Benefits

The benefits of using a high-quality, clear water bottle extend beyond basic hydration. They contribute to improved health, increased convenience, and a more enduring lifestyle.

**Enhanced Hydration Monitoring:** Clear water bottles allow you to effortlessly track your water intake throughout the day. By visually monitoring the water level, you can ensure you're meeting your daily hydration goals and proactively avoid dehydration, which can impact energy levels, cognitive function, and overall health. Furthermore, easily seeing the cleanliness of the bottle encourages more frequent washing.
**Eco-Kind Option to Single-Use Plastics:** Opting for a reusable clear water bottle drastically reduces your reliance on single-use plastic bottles. this contributes to a smaller carbon footprint, reduces plastic waste in landfills and oceans, and promotes a more sustainable consumption pattern. Over time, this simple switch can have a significant positive impact on the environment.
**Versatile Beverage Compatibility:** Many clear water bottles are designed to accommodate a wide range of beverages, from water and juice to smoothies and infused drinks. Borosilicate glass bottles,in particular,are resistant to flavor absorption,ensuring that your water remains pure and untainted,even after holding coffee or tea.This versatility makes them a practical choice for diverse hydration needs.
**Improved Health and Hygiene:** Using a reusable bottle reduces the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals that can leach from single-use plastics, especially when exposed to heat. clear bottles also make it easier to spot and remove any buildup of bacteria or mold, promoting better hygiene and preventing potential health risks. Regular cleaning and visual inspection are simplified.

## FAQs Section

Selecting the right clear water bottle involves addressing common consumer inquiries. Here are some answers to frequent questions.**are all clear plastic water bottles BPA-free?**
While the majority of reputable clear plastic water bottles are marketed as BPA-free, it's crucial to thoroughly examine the product description and labels. Look for certifications or statements specifically mentioning ""BPA-free"" or ""non-toxic."" If the material is unclear, contacting the manufacturer directly is advisable to confirm its composition.

**How often should I clean my clear water bottle?**
Ideally, a clear water bottle should be cleaned daily, especially if it's used for beverages other than water. For frequent water use, cleaning every other day may suffice. Thorough cleaning should involve warm, soapy water and a bottle brush to scrub the interior.Regularly cleaning helps prevent the growth of bacteria and mold, ensuring optimal hygiene.

**Can I put my clear water bottle in the dishwasher?**
The dishwasher compatibility of a clear water bottle depends on the material and construction. Tritan plastic bottles are typically dishwasher safe,but it's advisable to place them on the top rack to prevent warping from high heat. Borosilicate glass bottles are generally dishwasher safe on either rack. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning guidelines.

**What are the best practices for storing a clear water bottle when not in use?**
When not in use, store your clear water bottle with the lid removed or ajar to allow for ventilation and prevent the buildup of moisture and odors. Ensure the bottle is completely dry before storing it in a clean, cool place. Avoid storing it in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, which can degrade certain materials over time.

1mfkpxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/kootenays/comments/1mfkpxq/recommendations_please/,Recommendations please! 🙏,"Hello good people of the Kootenays!

I’m so excited because I haven’t travelled around the area in sooo long and this year I finally get to show my wife (and possibly some friends) how awesome this area is. 

I grew up spending a lot of my summers with my aunt and uncle in Slocan, and although I still try to visit every year I don’t get around much as they’re elderly and don’t like to go out so much.

Anyway, would love some recommendations for: paddleboarding, coffee, ice cream, donuts, nice walks, cheese/poutine (my wife’s from Quebec), queer events/businesses.

Our itinerary looks roughly like:
Aug 7: Day trip up to Nakusp from Slocan
Aug 8: Kaslo/Ainsworth, camp at Kokanee Creek
Aug 9: Creston, camp at Yahk
Aug 10-11: going up to Kootenay National Park, camping there for 2 nights 
Aug 12: camping at the Canyon Hot Springs Resort
Aug 13: through Revelstoke back down to Slocan.

Thanks! 😊

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”

# Chapter 3

Auren POV

As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn’t even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.

Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya’s and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.

But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud “bump”, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. “No–” I struggled.

“Ha, you think you can escape?” Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn’t see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. “Get her.” She ordered before throwing me to the ground.

Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. “Please leave me alone!” I begged them. “Let me live.”

As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. “Live? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!” she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas’ quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.

I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. “Please leave me. Please.” But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.

I don’t know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. “Luna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,” he ordered. “It will reduce your pain.”

“C—can I talk to her?” I asked.

He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.

I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. “This is not justified, goddess,” I said aloud. “It is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.” Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. “What have you written for me in this life?”

The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, “How could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!”

With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, “I am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.”

He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. “Auren!” he shouted. “How dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.”

I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.

“Bram!” Maris entered the room and shouted at him. “Don’t do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!”

Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,

“I, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.”

“Noooo!” I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.

“I will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,” I heard her voice before I fainted.

When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn’t reach her. She was more hurt than I was.

Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn’t have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.

She chuckled. “What a wretched bitch!” She pulled me up roughly. “Luna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.”

She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. “Wear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.”

I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?

The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris’s old one.

Reya’s face lit up with a shrewd grin. “Congratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.”

Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.

The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien’s arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.

A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I’d ever seen.

I have been on IF paired with a calorie deficit for almost a month now. I started this because I mostly wanted to lose weight and just begin living a more healthy life style. 32M, 5’7”, 190 starting weight / 179 current weight. I do a 16/8 fast from 11-7, typically eating 2 meals a day sometimes with a small snack in between, typically an apple. I’ve been doing basic at home workouts about every other day (stationary bike, pushups, body squats and resistance band work to hit other muscle groups. So far, I feel damn good. I’ve had 3 knee surgery’s including ACL reconstructions on both knees. Before I started this, my knees hurt and were swelled ALL THE TIME. Especially after physical activity. Now I barely notice it. 

Now that I’ve been reading more into fasting and the health benefits I’m considering an extended fasting, but I have a few questions. First, how long of a fast should I start with and are there things I can do leading up to the fast that can help prepare me? Second, is it recommended to drink only water during the fast or are other liquids like tea or black coffee encouraged? Lastly, what are the best foods to break an extended fasting with? 

Any insight or other things you can share that you think might be helpful is super appreciated! ",1,1754120044.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1mfklw7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfklw7,"**🚀 I Created a Note-Making Framework Called PIVOT – Designed for People Who Want Flexibility, Not More “Tasks” [60% Off Template]**","Hey everyone! 👋

After years of wrestling with rigid note-taking systems and feeling like I was spending more time _maintaining_ my notes than actually _using_ them, I finally built something that clicked — something that _grows with me_, not just _organizes me_.

I’m calling it the **PIVOT Framework** — and it’s been a game-changer in how I manage thoughts, goals, projects, and knowledge in a way that actually feels _natural_ and _motivating_.

### 🌱 What is PIVOT?

It’s a **flexible, action-oriented framework** for personal knowledge management. Instead of forcing you into strict categories or rigid hierarchies, PIVOT uses **four fluid categories** — with one timeless philosophy.

- **Pulse** → Your active projects + next actions (the heartbeat of your system)
    
- **Inspire** → Notes, knowledge, ideas, articles, sparks of curiosity
    
- **Vibe** → Habits, journaling, routines, responsibilities
    
- **Orbit** → Long-term dreams, aspirations, and someday-maybes
    
- **Timeless** → A design principle to make your notes _sustainably useful_ over time

It's tool-agnostic by nature, but I personally use it inside **Obsidian** with a setup that's minimal, low-maintenance, and adaptable.

### Why I Built It

Most systems made me feel like I was doing _admin work_, not building momentum.

I wanted something that lets me:

- Take action _without friction_
    
- Let ideas grow over time
    
- Build habits and routines that support my projects
    
- Stay connected to long-term vision without getting overwhelmed

So I designed PIVOT around **growth**, not perfection — and **action**, not overload.

### Want to Try It?

I’ve put together a **starter template** for Obsidian (hosted on Buy Me a Coffee) — and I’m currently offering a **Kickstarter discount of 60% off** for the launch.

👉 [Get the Starter Template (60% off)](buymeacoffee.com/arsalaan.fa/e/425666)

🎟️ **Use Promo Code:** `E1W5SXSV` at checkout

I also wrote a detailed guide and published it on **[Amazon KDP](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHD3G29N)** (for those who want the full philosophy, workflow, examples, and mindset behind it all).

### If This Resonates With You…

I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and questions. This is a personal system that grew out of trial and error, and I genuinely hope it can help others who want **less friction, more flow** in their note-making practice.

Thanks for reading, and keep pivoting toward what matters.

**TL;DR**: I built a flexible, project-driven PKM framework called **PIVOT** — now live with a 60% off Obsidian template. Self-promo, but made with love.",2,1754119892.0,PKMS,0,1.0,False

1mfkl6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/1mfkl6c/my_favourite_things_about_growing_up_in_adelaide/,My favourite things about growing up in Adelaide,"Hey folks,

Lately, I’ve been thinking about the idea of moving away from my quiet suburban life in Adelaide’s North East to somewhere more rural in South Australia. So, I’ve written some of my favourite things about growing up here so that I’ll always have this reminder of what my first home felt like. 

I thought it might be nice to share, and am interested to see what the community would add to this convo. 


Here it is:

It’s the sunlight dancing through the trees in Mount Crawford Forest, casting shadows that shift with every breath of wind.
It’s the gentle rumble of old cars cruising on a hot summer’s night, that familiar hum echoing through quiet suburban streets.
It’s watching the sun nudge itself to sleep over Semaphore and waking up with it in Ardrossan.

Floating in the ocean in the dead of night, I look up at the stars twinkling so brightly, it feels as though the universe is wrapping around me, whispering secrets only I can hear.
Winter mornings at Parafield Airport, where fog settles above every blade of grass, softening the world into a dreamlike haze.

It’s driving along the Port River Expressway and watching birds soar in perfect unison over the rubbish dump, a strange kind of beauty only locals understand.
Or watching the water levels rise and fall with the seasons as you wind through Chain of Ponds.

I love the soft dirt trails of the Botanic Gardens, where every path feels like a new discovery.
The blue-tongue lizards sunbathing lazily on hot asphalt, and the thrill of spotting a ladybug in a  local park.

Racing against the shore at Noarlunga just to glimpse a pod of dolphins gliding across glassy waters in the early mornings.

There’s a shade of blue in our summer skies - so impossibly vivid I’ve never seen it replicated anywhere else.

The comforting smell of charity op shops, the calm of Bunnings plant sections, and the friendly nods from workers at your local shopping centre who now know your coffee order by heart.

It’s the squabble of magpies on a spring morning, the sight of kangaroos grazing quietly in the Adelaide Hills, and the majestic presence of police horses, standing tall and calm amidst city noise.

1mfkknm,https://www.reddit.com/r/lungcancer/comments/1mfkknm/end_of_the_journey_mom_in_hospice/,"End of the journey, mom in hospice","I am trying to prepare for losing my mom and my best friend. I guess I already have lost her. 

Diagnosed February 2019. Achieved remission with chemo+radiation and immunotherapy. Cancer returned in summer 2023. Back on immunotherapy until she has to be taken off of it due to recurring pneumonitis in March 2024. Went treatment free until nearly dying of a pleural effusion in July 2024. She was moved to a palliative bed and we were given weeks-2 months to go. My mom fought like hell and lived another year. She tried 3 different chemos this year including a targeted therapy but nothing worked. 

She has been slowing down the last few months. More fatigue, more weakness, weight loss, hair loss, (which really bothered her), more nausea, needing oxygen more and more. The last two weeks she’s gotten sort of quiet and sleeping a lot. But still trying to run errands, still visiting with friends and family, still chatting. Still making coffee for visitors. 

She did not want people to see her as sick and she put on a good front. She never complained about pain but now I am wondering how much she’s been suffering.

We’ve had a lot of talks this past year. She was pissed. She did not want to die, didn’t feel ready to die, refused to accept it. Kept fighting and pushing herself every single day. Kept holding out hope she’d get more time. 

Yesterday morning she couldn’t wake up. When we woke her to get her meds in, she looked different. She kept saying “what do I do/what am I gonna do?” And “oh no/ oh fuck.” I think she realized yesterday morning that she was too weak to go on. That she couldn’t fight anymore. And seeing her realize that will haunt me forever. 

Today she moved to hospice after a rough night at home. She hasn’t woken up much since yesterday at 12. She’s had 3 brief moments of alertness, and there is anxiety in those moments. The hospice is managing her pain and anxiety now, and over the last few hours she’s not responsive to waking her up/talking to her. The palliative doctor told us people like my mom, who fight and push so long, tend to have a crash and go fast. 

I really believed she had one more rally in her until today. 

I don’t know how I’m going to live without her. She’s my best friend. We talk every day, and I see her almost every day. We’ve been insanely close since I was born. Talking to her is as natural as thinking my own  thoughts. I can’t believe I’ll never speak to my mom again. I’ll never hear her voice or feel her hugs ever again. I want to die a bit thinking about it but I have two children and have to go on for them. But I’m pissed too. She was the best grandmother. She was the best mom. She always showed up, always helped, she was funny, kind, nurturing. And my kids, 2 and 8 weeks old, won’t even remember her. 

Cancer is such a cruel disease. I hate this. She deserved more time. She really did. She desperately wanted it.

1mfkk70,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1mfkk70/a_guide_to_making_friends/,A Guide to Making Friends,"Hey all. I've been considering recently what my ""super powers"" are and I think one of them is truly making friends and connecting with new people. I wanted to offer my perspective on skills and strategies that really make a difference:

1. Find hubs of community. This can be religious, sports, local groups, area specific Facebook pages, reddit, hobbies, book clubs. Whatever. Preferably consistent meetings so that you can see the same people over and over. It is always easier to meet someone who have seen a few times before. **Familiarity is an incredibly disarming and useful tool.**
2. Be okay with rejection. Rejection is a part of every single aspect of life - romantic or professional. Get used to being blown off or ignored. This is part of life and no ""cool"" person or ""extrovert"" is above it.
3. Be the one to organize. Try to source interesting events or places for the group to hang out.  Be the one to find the cute coffee shop or park, new restaurant, or local event. Find something for the group to do together. **You are better off creating a group from scratch than joining an existing group where you will always be the outsider.** Making new memories together is crucial for bonding and being a source of connection to community is a kind of social currency.
4. Try new things alone.  Feeling uncomfortable is completely natural and extroverts get nervous too, but forcing yourself to stay in a situation where social connection is the thing that alleviates the pressure is a great motivator. People are SO much more likely to try to connect if you are alone.  If you are open to connect and are alone (at a bar or something like that), and make eye contact or smile, it's very easy to meet new people NOT JUST TO HOOK UP OR DATE. We don't have a ton of community hangouts in the US now. I read at the bar and it's great. I also play pool and it's a very low-pressure way to connect.
5. Try to meet people with the same goals. There are always people trying to make new friends. Find the people who are willing to put in effort and are seeking out community instead of rare people you feel you have a ton in common with at the start. They will likely also be open to meeting new people and sometimes what you need is a buddy to explore new things/find your people!
6. Chat just to chat. Try to let your defenses down and just make conversation. It may not be with someone who will be a lasting friend but social skills are muscles and being comfortable/navigating situations that may not be your preference is good for you. People will see that and feel more comfortable approaching you.
7. Say yes. Try to say yes to plans as often as you can in early relationships.",2,1754119711.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

""Huh, so the grass really is blue,"" Glory said.


""I told you I wasn't lying,"" Deathbringer responded smugly.


Glory circled and examined the portal on Penthara, trying to find clues about where they were. The three moons hung high in the sky, casting moon rays onto the portal's pristine white.


""So where do we go now?"" Glory asked.


""Let's head towards the town,"" Deathbringer suggested, ""That's where I saw the new thing going.""


""What if we get spotted, genius?""


""Then you can go invisible and sit on top of me,"" Deathbringer said, smiling.


""Ok, calm down,"" Glory responded, ""Let's head over there before sunrise.""


—The Next Day—


Kaitlyn woke up on the couch groggily. The leather couch scuffed against her skin as she lifted her body. She wanted to sleep on Tommy's bed, but wanted to preserve her reputation as an independent woman who didn't need handouts from a 17-year-old boy. After rubbing the crust from her eyes, she glanced over her shoulder at the bed. It was completely unoccupied and looked so cozy. Now she wished she had taken up that offer. Kaitlyn rose from the couch and peeked around the house, looking for Tommy. 


""Hellooooo, Tommy, "" she exclaimed out loud, ""where are you?""


""I'm out front!"" Kaitlyn heard from beyond the front door.


Kaitlyn walked outside to see Tommy and someone else next to him. The warm and cozy smell of Tommy’s house left her nose, as the familiar smell of pine from yesterday re-entered her nostrils.


""Good Morning, sleepy head, you've been out for a while.""


""How long is a while..."" Kaitlyn responded skeptically.


""11 hours,"" the unfamiliar guy said, smirking.


""And no one thought to wake me up?!""


""Nah, you were dead to the world. Get this, I threw a pillow at you, and the most you did was sniff!"" Tommy laughed, as well as the newcomer letting out a small chuckle.


At this point Kaitlyn was fuming, being the butt of 2 jokes already in the past 10 seconds.


She assumed this new guy was Quinn, who lived on the outskirts. She immediately went to size him up. But reevaluated her actions as she was still not fully awake from her slumber. Quinn had a black long-sleeved shirt and dark red sweatpants on. His hair was long and was braided into a French braid. She was shocked to realize it had been so long that it had reached the back of his waist. He also had a dark gray shawl clipped around his neck and shoulders. He was also very tall—around 6'2, completely towering over Tommy. Quinn also had a necklace with a scorched-black colored stone as the pendant.


""Anyways,"" Tommy said, wiping away tears of laughter, ""Can you go get Lexi for me?""


""Now you want me to run more chores for you?!"" Kaitlyn snapped.


""Well, you wanna meet another girl from Earth, don't you?"" Quinn asked, raising one eyebrow.


Though Kaitlyn didn't want to give him satisfaction knowing he was right, she agreed anyway. She then walked over to the other house and knocked on it. It was very similar to Tommy's, with the only difference being that the other house had more plants in front of it. 


""Yes?"" A girl answered the door. Kaitlyn assumed this was Lexi.


Lexi had long, straight, strawberry-blonde hair and emerald-green eyes that glistened in the sun's rays.


""Hi, are you Lexi?""


""Yeah... that's me."" Lexi gave Kaitlyn a confused look, ""I haven't seen you around here. Are you new?""


""Yeah, I came out of that portal yesterday.""


""Oh really? We haven't had anyone new in forever!"" Lexi was practically jumping off the ground with joy. ""Look, we have to get to know each other! Uh, what's your name?""


""My name's Kaitlyn. Tommy asked me to get you for him, so we should probably head over.


""Oh, alright,"" Lexi said. ""Just give me a minute or two."" Lexi went back inside her house and came out with a beige jacket and grass-green sweatpants. They then walked over to Tommy's house.


""Hey Lexi,"" Quinn exclaimed.


""Hi, Quinn!"" She replied with too much excitement than Kaitlyn could handle.


""You're Quinn, right?"" Kaitlyn asked.

""Yeah, you're Kaitlyn. Tommy told me about you.""


*What could he have possibly said about me? Probably something like, ""She's so tragic.""*


""Look, can you take Lexi from me?"" Kaitlyn whispered to Quinn, ""I can't handle her right now.""


Quinn let out a small chuckle, ""I don't think she can handle me.""


Kaitlyn then gave Lexi to Quinn and slipped away into the kitchen where Tommy was located. He looked very concentrated on whatever he was making.


""So… you just summoned everyone here? Seems very dramatic of you."" Kaitlyn teased.


""Uh, ok, bro,"" Tommy said, annoyed, ""I just thought you would want to meet them, so I invited them for breakfast.""


Kaitlyn looked over to see what Tommy was cooking, ""Steak? For breakfast?""


""Uh, yeah. Steak and eggs.""


""Where'd you get the eggs? I don't think chickens live in cold climates.""


""I got it from the market in town.""


""Oh, you gotta take me there today,"" Kaitlyn said whilst noticing Tommy desperately trying not to mess up the steak.


""Alright. I got you,"" Tommy replied without paying much attention to the question.


""Thanks,"" Kaitlyn muttered while walking towards Quinn and Lexi.


""Hey Lexi,"" Kaitlyn called out, ""I think Tommy needs help with something. You should give him a hand, make sure he doesn't burn down the place.""


""Uh... alright,"" Lexi stood up and walked towards the kitchen, where Tommy was.


""Hey, Quinn."" Kaitlyn called out softly


Quinn was spread across the couch with one arm over it.


""You did that so you can talk to me, huh?"" Kaitlyn was caught off guard by his comment because he was right.


""Yeah. Tommy told me a lot about you,"" Kaitlyn explained, ""He told me about this magic book stuff.""


""Ah...yeah, he wasn't supposed to do that.""


""Well, originally, Derek came up to Tommy and told him to guard it or whatever, but he didn't know I was there.""


""Oh, I don't like that guy,"" Quinn said truthfully. ""So what did he do?""


""He hired me.""


""Wow. He did that really fast."" Quinn took a moment to collect his thoughts. ""You were also fast in accepting his deal."" 


""Well, I couldn't disagree with 30 dollars an hour.""


Now that was mostly true. However, she also accepted the job because she might have the chance to get to learn more about these magical artifacts.


""You also accepted it to learn more about the magic stuff, right?"" Quinn asked while taking a sip out of a mug he set on the coffee table in front of the couch.


*Kaitlyn blinked. What the hell??? Is this guy a psychic or just freakishly observant?*


""Uh... maybe?"" she muttered.


""Lemme guess—Tommy spilled my secrets, and now you’re curious.""


*Oh damn, he’s right.* 


Lexi finished helping out Tommy with his steak and came back to Quinn and Kaitlyn.


""How'd it go?"" Quinn asked.


""He does NOT know how to cook AT ALL,"" Lexi exclaimed, ""I mean, why would he even offer us breakfast at his place if he can't cook?""


""HEY I CAN COOK!"" Tommy yelled from across the room.


""You had me flip the steak for you.""


""Well, whatever,"" Tommy muttered.


“Next time, let me cook.” Lexi added, “I promise you won’t need a fire extinguisher.”


Tommy grunted a little at Lexi’s comment, then went back to cooking.


""So, Kaitlyn, where are you from?"" Lexi asked.


""Texas.""


""Oh, you were probably confused when Tommy told you the name of the town,"" Lexi commented. ""Do you live in Austin?""


""No, but now I do."" Kaitlyn then stood up and walked to Tommy to check up on his cooking.


""So, how's it going?""


""I'm doing great! Thanks for asking.""


""I was talking about the food.""


""Oh, it's…you know, doing its thing, I hope.""


""Hmm,"" Kaitlyn hesitated. ""Want me to handle the eggs?""


""YES, please!"" Tommy replied desperately.


""Alright, give me the pan."" Kaitlyn snatched the pan out of Tommy's hands and gestured for him to go away. 


*Ugh. Why can't Tommy take care of himself? Like, I know he's a child or whatever, but if you're living on your own, then you gotta make your food. It's eggs, bro. EGGS. SCRAMBLED EGGS. It's not that hard.* After Kaitlyn finished the eggs, she turned off the stove and called Tommy to plate and serve the meal.


""And here you go."" Tommy slid a plate over to Kaitlyn.


Kaitlyn described the steak as looking edible. Kaitlyn then stuck her fork into it and cut off a piece before putting it into her mouth.


""Oh wow Tommy,"" Kaitlyn said with her mouth stuffed, ""This isn't bad.""


""That's because he needed my help,"" Lexi commented. “You know, I was a chef back on Earth.”


“Really?” Tommy exclaimed. “How come you’ve never mentioned that around us?”


“Because you never asked.”


“Bro, that’s not something you wait for someone to bring up.”


Kaitlyn zoned out of the conversation and looked out of one of Tommy's windows to admire the view. I can say Tommy chose a pretty good spot for his house. It has a nice view. Just as she was about to talk to her newfound friends again, she spotted something out of the corner of her eye. A black shadow that quickly moved across the window, out of view. uhmm, what was that? Is someone spying on us? Tommy and Lexi were bickering over something dumb, with Quinn half-smirking in the corner, but not engaging in conversation.


""Did one of you guys go outside?""


""Uh, no. We've all been inside,"" Lexi replied, ""Why'd you ask?”


""I just... thought I saw something.""


Maybe it was the fact that Kaitlyn just stepped into this world, or she was just shy with everyone else, making her paranoid. Or it could be that she really did see something.


""I'm going to take a step outside for a bit."" Kaitlyn then put her shoes and jacket on and walked out the door. Quinn stared at Kaitlyn as she left, with a curious and confused look on his face.


~~~~~


Deathbringer tried to make his steps as quiet as possible as he walked through the snowy tundra with Glory.


""Hey, this is like where we first met, huh?""


""It sure does look like it,"" Glory responded with an annoyed tone. Although Glory was invisible, Deathbringer could still tell what face Glory was making.


""We're here to investigate and not get caught, Deathbringer,"" Glory added, ""I'll fly up and scout around the area. You stay on the ground and look for those scavengers you saw.""


""You got it."" Glory then gave Deathbringer a light tap on the shoulder and flew up into the cold, snowy air. 


Deathbringer went closer to the house where he saw 4 scavengers go inside to find a good place to take cover, but also have a good view of what they were going on inside.


Perhaps it was the fact that he was on a different continent, but something made Deathbringer more anxious than he would normally be.


Just run and find a place to take cover. Deathbringer told himself.


Deathbringer spotted a group of trees that would hide him, but he would have to run across a window so the scavengers could look out and see him. Flying also wasn't an option. His wing beats would be loud enough for the scavengers to hear.


Just do it. The longer you wait, the higher the chance you will have of getting caught. 


Deathbringer sprinted across towards the trees and ducked down behind one. 
He decided to take a small peek into the window of the scavenger den. He was shocked to see the two eyes of a female scavenger peering back at him.


*Did she see me? Did I get caught? Glory is gonna be so mad if I do.*


All Deathbringer could do was hope the scavenger wouldn't come outside and look around for him.


~~~~~


""I'm telling you I saw something!"" Kaitlyn 
pleaded.


""I don't know, man, I don't see anything,"" Quinn responded as they stepped outside.


“Dude, I thought you were supposed to be the smart one,"" Kaitlyn commented. ""If you don't want to help me, I'll decode this mystery all by myself.""


""Decode? You're not ‘decoding’ anything.” Quinn said with a smug look on his face. 


“This isn't even a mystery. You just saw something, and why’d you use ‘decode?’ You mean you’ll solve this mystery all by yourself.” Quinn corrected her.


“I don't know,” Kaitlyn said with an annoyed tone. “It just sounded right.”


Just as Kaitlyn finished his sentence, they heard wingbeats pushing wind, almost as if there was a giant hawk in the sky. Something made that sound. That wasn't ""just the wind.""


""Huh, maybe you're not seeing things,"" Quinn muttered.


""I told you!"" Kaitlyn shouted, triumph lighting her face.


""How about..."" Quinn took a second to think and process his situation. ""How about we check the trees over there?""


Quinn pointed to a group of trees on the right. It was between Quinn and Tommy's houses, and was in the direction Kaitlyn saw the figure going.


""Yeah, good idea.""


Kaitlyn and Quinn went towards the trees and walked slowly as soon as they got near them. The trees gave off this menacing aura that she didn't enjoy. Kaitlyn made a gesture towards Quinn, telling him to be quiet. She listened in and only heard the sound of bugs chirping and distant wind. She was about to rush in when she heard a voice.


""You let them see you?!"" A woman-like voice loudly whispered.


""I didn't do it on purpose."" A male voice responded, ""I was just nervous.""


""Nervous? You're never nervous, Deathbringer. “And since when did assassins start TRIPPING OVER THEIR OWN TAILS?”


*Assassin? Is someone trying to kill one of us? And is their name DEATHBRINGER? WHO NAMES THEIR CHILD DEATHBRINGER?*


Kaitlyn looked at Quinn and gave him a nervous look. She was surprised to see his face calm and stoic, not saying a word.


""I'm not an assassin anymore, and we are on a different continent with large scavengers running around.""


Kaitlyn took a step back, accidentally stepping on a crisp leaf.


*Dammit! That was loud. They definitely heard that.*


She glanced towards Quinn, who gave her an ""Are you serious?"" look. The people in the foreKaitlyn st also stopped talking. She assumed the woman was whispering something to the boy. Still looking at Quinn, Kaitlyn started to whisper to him.


Kaitlyn’s heart slammed against her chest. She pressed her hands against her mouth, hoping they hadn’t heard her.


""What do we do? They definitely heard us."" Kaitilyn said, sweating heavily


Quinn stared passed Kaitlyn's eyes and then responded to her, ""Oh yeah, they heard us."" Quinn then pointed behind her, causing her to whip her head around.


What met her was something out of a fantasy book. She saw a dragon only about a foot away from her face. The dragon had black scales all over their body and giant wings. Although Kaitlyn had never seen a dragon before, she could tell that this one was the owner of the male voice she heard because of his size and his facial structure. Kaitlyn, panicking, pulled out a small knife from her pocket and swiped at the dragon's face. It made this disgusting scratching sound as it pierced through the dragon’s scales.


The dragon recoiled with a sharp hiss, surprised. Her blade hadn't done any damage... until the dragon's black wing instinctively shifted forward to shield itself. The knife slashed through his scales.


""GAH!"" The dragon roared, stumbling back.


Kaitlyn immediately regretted her decision when another dragon materialized out of thin air. The dragon had many different colors of scales; blue, green, and orange colors glistened in the sunlight. The dragon had fury in its eyes and looked like it was about to strike.


Kaitlyn looked towards Quinn, who had a shocked look on his face. He didn’t know Kaitlyn had a knife on her, or that she would use it that carelessly.


""You stabbed him?!"" Quinn was finally showing feelings of fear. The dragon roared. ""What were you thinking?"" Quinn studied the dragon, deciding what his next actions would be.


She looked back towards the dragon and sensed her fury. Kaitlyn was now hyperventilating, falling to the floor. She tried to pick her feet up and run away as fast as possible, but her legs wouldn't move. Her body wouldn't move. It was like someone had put her in a freezer for a few hours and taken her out. 


Was that the right decision? He’s an ASSASSIN. He was going to kill me AND Quinn if I didn’t do what I just did. But what if he came in peace? What if I just ruined a potential friendship with some dragons? Does Quinn think I did the right thing?


Her chest tightened, and she could feel her skin go colder as if it weren’t cold enough. Her skin tightened into her chest as the dragon stared into her soul. In a blink, the girl dragon was almost on top of her, fangs out and mouth open. 


""Woah, woah, woah."" Quinn made his presence noticeable before putting himself between Kaitlyn and the colorful dragon.


""How about we don't kill each other,"" Quinn suggested.


""Excuse me?"" The dragon was practically yelling now. ""She just stabbed him."" 


The dragon pointed her talon towards Kaitlyn, then back at the dragon on the ground, whom Kaitlyn assumed was Deathbringer. 


""Ok, I understand, but she was panicking, and you guys were talking about being assassins.""


""Hmmf."" The dragon let out. “Put the dagger down, girl.”


“…okay,” Kaitlyn responded nervously. She dropped the blade on the ground and kicked it away.


""Here, give me a second."" Quinn opened his bag and started to walk towards Deathbringer, who was on the ground.


""You ok?"" Quinn asked Deathbringer


""I can handle this. I got stabbed by a scavenger before."" Deathbringer responded.


""Huh, scavenger,"" Quinn muttered to himself. ""Interesting.""


Quinn pulled out a small glass bottle with a light red liquid inside. The liquid was thinner than water but less transparent. Quinn popped the cork and sealed the bottle off. Deathbringer is confused by what Quinn is doing, but decides to trust him. 


""What is that?"" The other dragon asked.


""Restorative,"" Quinn responded simply. ""I modified it from an old recipe in Derek's book stash. I've been working on this for a while, and I was gonna save it, but this seemed important.""


As soon as the liquid hit his black scales, Deathbringer twitched, but his scales started to stitch themselves together, sealing the wound.


""Oh wow,"" he said, flexing his wings. ""It worked.""


Quinn just nonchalantly shrugged it off.


""How did you know that wasn't going to melt his scales off?"" The other dragon questioned.


""How about we introduce ourselves before asking each other more questions?"" Quinn responded, ignoring the question, ""My name is Quinn.""


Kaitlyn looked back at the house. She and Quinn promised to be back within 5 minutes at most, and they had been out for much longer. That’s when she started to see Tommy and Lexi stepping out of the house. 


Oh boy, they don’t know what they’re in for. 


While the colorful dragon started arguing with Quinn, Deathbringer walked up to Kaitlyn and started talking to her.


""Those are your friends?""


""Oh,"" Kaitlyn wasn't suspecting Deathbringer to come up to her. Especially after she stabbed him. ""Yeah. Yeah, they are.""


""They won't try to stab me when they see me right?"" Deathbringer joked. Kaitlyn wasn't too fond of that joke. 


""Y’know,"" Deathbringer said, ""I think it would be beneficial for both of our groups if we worked together.""


""What do you mean?"" Kaitlyn questioned.


""I mean, you guys can give us that potion recipe for something in return.""


""What are you offering?""


 Deathbringer thought for a moment before coming up with an answer.


""We got magical items too, y’know?"" Deathbringer answered, ""How does 4 dragon disguises sound?""

This is my first trip back to the U.S. since getting my dream job. I have a couple of days to catch up with my friends and relax before I have to head back to Paris and the first thing I did was get a front-row ticket to the Strikers tour to see Toxic Rose Thorns—my favorite band of all time.

It's not the first time I see them. I went a few times before they blew up when I was in college. This is my first time seeing them this close and I am excited. The tickets had been sold out for weeks but my super, amazingly beautiful, cutthroat boss pulled some strings to help me get a ticket. It was probably the very last one of its kind and here I am. Inches away from kissing the damn stage anxiously excited and waiting for this crappy opening band to get done.

That's not fair. They're actually not that bad.

I glance back to see that the arena is most definitely sold out. The sea of people are watching the show, dancing, and moshing to the sweet screeching of the second band playing. I take a couple of pictures and make sure to get the name on the banner so that I can check out their music with a little less chaos later.

This is the first show I come to alone, but I don't feel alone. The swarm of people in the pit is energetic. None of us are strangers at the moment. We're all the best of friends as we wait for our favorite band to come out and bless us with their metalcore glory.

""I love your outfit!"" one of the girls leaning on the rails catches my attention. ""Where did you get it?""

""I made it,"" I laugh. ""I love your T-shirt. I have one from their first show at the House of Blues,""

""Yes!"" she wraps her arms around me. ""Did you go?""

""Yeah, it was my twenty-first birthday,"" I nod.

""Oh, my god. I was there too. With my Ex,"" she rolls her eyes. ""He's the one that introduced me to this,""

""That's crazy. My Ex introduced me too,"" I laugh.

""His name wasn't Connor was it?""

""No,"" I shake my head. ""His name was Jose,""

""Ugh,"" we both laugh. ""This is my friend Naty. I'm Jesse,""

""Phoebe,"" I shake their hands.

""I've never met a Phoebe before,"" her friend screams. ""We have to take a picture,""

""Okay,"" I laugh.

""TRT on three,"" she shouts holding her phone up. ""One. Two. Three!""

The three of us shout TRT and she snaps four or five pictures at once.

""What's your Quick Howl?"" Jesse asks.

""CT\_OFPhoebs98,"" I say and she types it into her phone. She looks up at me confused.

""This is you?"" she asks holding her phone up.

""Yeah,""

""You're verified. You have four million followers,""

""I work for Royal Threads. I'm a designer,"" I laugh. They both scream.

""Oh, my god! I love their new pink Academia collection. Holy shit,"" Naty screams. ""I work for Gossip Daily. I'm a reporter,""

""I'm in the music industry,"" Jesse says. My phone buzzes in my pocket. I see that the two of them are now following me and that they've tagged me in a picture.

The sound of Knightly Blake's guitar blasts from the speakers and our conversation is instantly forgotten. The crowd erupts into screams as the curtain is raised to reveal the black lights and purple lasers.

My heart skips when he stops at the edge of the stage with his favorite baby blue guitar right in front of us. My scream is stuck in my throat as he leans forward to speak into the mic. The entire show goes on in a blur of screaming and singing along. It ends way too soon leaving my body buzzing and wanting more.

By the time I got back to my rental, I remembered that I had spoken to those girls and laugh at myself because I didn't even get their numbers. I sit here for a bit and then wait to get out of the crowded parking lot.

I stop to get some tacos and drinks before heading back to the BnB I'll be staying in until the end of the month before I get back to work. Coincidentally, it wasn't too far from the venue. I probably would have walked if I wasn't a complete chicken and kind of afraid of the dark. It took me a lot longer to get here than I expected. I grab my food and my new TRT merch to head up.

As I'm rounding the lobby to get to the elevators someone smacks right into me. I drop some of my things but not my food.

""Yes, I didn't drop my tacos,"" I laugh and reach down to grab the sweater on the floor.

""I am so sorry,"" the guy says and reaches for my things. ""I was on my phone,""

""It's okay. It happens,"" I say.

We both look up at the same time and I freeze. My stupid mouth falls open when my gaze clashes with his gorgeous jade-green eyes. He looks down at the sweater and the vinyl.

""No,"" he laughs. ""Are you just getting back from my show?""

I open my mouth and all that comes out is a squeak. That's Knightly fucking Blake. I touched his boots on stage earlier tonight. That's how close I was to him and now he's kneeling in front of me holding my stuff.

""Are you still breathing?"" he waves his hand in my face.

""Holy fuck. Dude! You're Knightly Blake,"" bursts out of my mouth loud enough for it to echo in the lobby's high ceilings.

""You're lucky there's not one here,"" he laughs. ""Are you okay?""

""Yeah, I didn't drop my tacos,"" I say and let him help me stand up.

""We wouldn't want that,"" he says putting my things together.

""I am so sorry. I didn't mean to scream in your face like that,"" I apologize.

""It happens,"" he grins looking me over. ""Where did you get my suit from last year's tour?""

""I made it. It's been my favorite costume since the suspenders. Um, I don't think I would been allowed into the venue if I had showed up in that,"" why did I say that? What the fuck is wrong with me?

""That's too bad. I bet you'd look amazing in it,"" he one-shoulder shrugs. I burst into laughter.

""That was kind of cringe,"" I admit.

""Why are you so red?"" he laughs.

""I just got hit on by Knightly Blake,"" I shake my head in disbelief. ""Would it be weird if I asked for a picture?""

""Not at all,"" he presses his lips together.

Is he blushing? Get the fuck out of here. I quickly set my things down and take my phone out of my back pocket.

""I am red,"" I laugh holding up my phone. ""It's cool. I'll edit it later. Ready?""

""Waiting on you,"" he grins. I snap our picture and show him. ""That's a good one. Be sure to tag me in that,""

""Okay,"" I agree and look up at him. He towers over me by at least six inches without my usual stilettos. He makes me feel small and I am not a small person.

""You and your friends were standing up front tonight. I almost stepped on your hand,"" he looks down at my things.

""You saw that? I would have been honored to have been stepped on by you,"" what the fuck?

""Is that right?"" he laughs and I feel my face heat up even more.

""There now we both said something stupid,"" I try to hide my embarrassment. We both laugh.

""You're not stalking us are you?"" he asks.

""No, I'm staying here,"" I shake my head and bend down to pick my things up again. He helps me and hands everything back. The elevator pings open and an old couple walks out with their little ugly dog. We both get into the elevator. I reach for the buttons at the same time he does and we both click the fourth floor. ""You gotta be fucking kidding me,""

""That is exactly what I was thinking,"" he laughs and turns his head slightly to look at me. We're about half an inch away from each other. ""You're not going to hit me if I kiss, are you?""

""My hands are full,"" I remind him.

""Right. You don't want to drop your tacos,"" he says. I step back until my back hits the mirrored wall behind me and suddenly his lips are on mine.

My first instinct is to run. It usually is, but when he steps closer burying his hand in my hair. I have no choice but to give in. He feels it the moment I do because his tongue sweeps my lips and I don't hesitate to let him take control of it. My skin comes alive when he touches me. The elevator pings and he pulls away without letting go of me.

""Oh, my god,"" I squeak making him grin.

""I'm sharing a room with two others,""

""There's no one at my place,"" I say without hesitation.

""Lead the way,"" he takes a step back.

My ears ring as I step out of the elevator. I glance back at him to make sure this is real. Am I really going to do this? I can think of several reasons why I shouldn't and almost all of them end up with me dead and or kidnapped. I stop in front of my door.

""My card is in my back pocket,"" I say.

The sly grin that crosses his face is enough to say fuck it. If this is the hill I die on, this is where it ends. His fingertips trail up the back of my thigh before he reaches into my pocket and slips out the key card. His eyes meet mine and he holds my stare as he swipes it through the reader.

""There you go,"" he says lowly. I lick my lips tasting his minty sweetness.

""Thank you,"" I fight the urge to laugh again because why the fuck did I just thank him? We walk inside and I immediately go over to the dining table to set everything down. ""There's a mess. I'm here for work,""

""You're an artist?"" he asks looking over my sketches and open portfolios.

""I'm a clothes designer,"" I say reaching for the Redd's Apple Ale I got earlier. ""Would you like a drink?""

""Sure,"" he says coming over to me.

I slide the box over to him and he takes one. He doesn't even look at what it is I provided for him. We both open the bottle and take a drink completely in sync. This is a dream. It has to be. His was more of a sip. He sets it down and reaches for my waist. When he positions himself in front of me he takes the bottle out of my hand.

""I've never done this,"" I admit.

""You're a virgin?"" he searches my face.

""No, no. I mean the one-night stand thing,"" I laugh nervously.

""I'll guide you through it,""

I gasp when his fingers dig into my thighs and then he lifts me onto the table. His mouth is on me again and this time, I have nothing in my hands to stop me from touching him. Holy shit! This is happening to me right now.

My hands are all over him and if he has a problem with it, he doesn't complain. His body is firm but not in a crazy buff kind of way. My shirt goes first and then my bra. His teeth graze my neck as he gently pushes me back to get to my bare breasts. The sound that comes out of me makes him grin as he bites down on the outside of my boob. The sting only serves to wake me up more. I pull his shirt over his head and toss it.

There is ink all over the place. I know some of these from when I was younger and had nothing better to do than obsess over him and the other members of the band. I can't believe I'm seeing them up close and personal. I touch them, trace them up his arm and onto his neck as he continues to palm my breasts and bite on them.

""Fuck, you're beautiful,"" he says unbuttoning my jeans. He lifts me a little to pull them down my thighs. He sets me down and takes them off along with my boots. ""You wore this to see me perform tonight?"" I can't bring myself to say anything so I just nod. ""These are not good girl panties,""

""You don't get to decide that,"" I laugh. ""But you can take them off,""

""I much rather leave them where they are,"" he grins. ""Lay back on the table,""

His hand presses down on my belly and I do as he asks. He smiles and tugs the fabric of my thong to the side. His fingers gently caress me. I squeak again when he rubs me in a circular motion. I lay back on the table when he slips his middle finger inside of me.

""That's it,"" he praises. ""Relax for me,""

""My name is Pheobe,"" I inform him.

""It is a pleasure to meet your acquaintance, Pheobe,"" he grins looking up at me. ""You can call me Knight,""

""Okay,"" I lay back. ""Knight,""

He slips his finger out of me, tucking his hands under me to lift me off the table. He buries his face between my legs and all I can do is hold on for dear life. Just like the show, everything happens in a blur.

It happens here on the table with my legs wrapped around him as our tongues get more than a little acquainted with one another. He starts off slow and I'm grateful for it because just like the rest of him. Knightly Blake is blessed by all the fucking gods in the universe. It's honestly not fair to any man on this earth.

The next thing I know, I bent over the table with his hand coming down on my ass making loud slaps while he keeps praising me and calling me his good girl. We stumble into the living room where he curls me up on the couch to successfully trap me under him in every position he can think of. I didn't know I could bend in some of the positions he put me in.

We end up in the shower and finally spend the rest of the night in the room until I fall asleep. I am deliciously sore all over when I wake up the next morning. He's nowhere in sight and at the moment, I think it's for the best.

I get up and find the vinyl I bought last night on the kitchen counter. It's signed by every member of the band and at the bottom where his signature is in silver marker reads. Don't worry Pheobe. To me, you're always going to be my good girl. Our little secret. Knight.

Thinking back on that night, despite how everything turned out in the end, I'll never bring myself to regret the choice I made. Before then, my life had been empty and he gave me the greatest gift I could have ever asked for. Well, gifts. Two of them with the same pretty jade green eyes. Aizen and Ayrie. The two little whoopsies I discovered growing inside of me in Paris, two months later.

Gone was the reckless little girl I was after freeing myself from my father's clutches. Things became clearer. The goal wasn't to prove to my dad that I could more than make it out on my own without him. It was all for them. They really put things into perspective for me and it was all because of that night. I didn't think he'd be who he became as he was when he found out he was a father and that I never had the intention of ever letting him know. Fate somehow favored me and I will forever be grateful for KNIGHTLY.

Six Years Later

Every time I get called into the school, the French headmistress calls me a filthy American bitch and I laugh at her because even if that is true, I pay her enough for her to overlook what my son has done yet again. God, I miss when that meant something.

Aizen is a biter.

I could ask where the kid got it from but the day after his conception tells me he got it from his father. The mother of the little boy my son tried to take a chunk out of, is livid. With good reason, but while Aizen's attack preference is biting, I have to ask what the kid did to get him there. Because he doesn't do it without reason. Ayrie loves to tease him and while she can get carried away, her brother has the patience of a saint, bless his soul. So, I doubt he did it without provocation.

The French mother is shouting all kinds of French vulgarities at me. Usually, people think I don't understand them, but I've been here for eight years of my life and I took French before moving here. I'm not here on a whim but to each their own. And of course, the first thing I learned to do was how to call someone a fucking asshole in French. It's, putain de trou du cul. It actually sounds really cool.

The headmistress glances over at me every so often to make sure I'm not taking offense to the shit coming out of this woman's mouth. I am so glad to be going home after all this time. When I first arrived, I was so excited. Because hello, Paris. Except the people here are mean and they smoke. Like a lot. I might miss the late morning work start, but the rest of it can go to shit for all I care. I've been to New York and that has nothing on this place. New York is just a bunch of aggressive sweeties. I'm glancing at you, Queens.

""What did he do to him?"" I finally cut in.

""He bit my son,"" she shouts in her dumb French accent.

""If you don't back up, French fry. I'll be biting you next,"" I sneer. She places her hand over her chest as if offended. As if she didn't just curse my son up, down, and sideways.

""There was a small altercation between Milos and Aizen over a lunch bag,"" the headmistress places my son's Bluey lunch bag on the desk.

""That's my son's. I packed it for him this morning. He doesn't like the food here,"" I open it to show her where I stitched his name tag.

""We serve only the best here,"" she scoffs. That's not the fucking point, lady.

""Try telling that to my five-year-old,"" I roll my eyes because that's not the fucking point, lady.

""American scum,"" the woman makes a spitting sound in my direction.

""Lady, you are lucky that our sons are here because I would love nothing more than to slam your stupid face into that desk,"" I say lowly so only she can hear me. ""Your son put his filthy hands on my son's belongings. It better not happen again,"" I snatch the bag off the desk. ""Do you understand?"" I repeat it to her in French and her entire demeanor falls apart. ""You seem to have gotten that one,""

""You're going to let her speak to me like that? I pay good money for my son to come here-""

""So do I. I have two kids here,"" I scoff. ""And I'm on the committee,""

""You have two children?"" she glares at me.

""Are we done?"" I ask the headmistress.

""I am sorry, Miss Altaha,"" she apologizes. ""Is there anything I can do for you while you're here?""

Her tone makes me wish I wasn't a strong, independent, and educated woman back on my reservation in California. There's only a week left. I don't need this shit and neither do the twins.

""You can bring my daughter out and I'd like their transcripts, please,"" I nod. She tenses up and looks between me and the woman next to me.

""Miss Altaha, I will see to it that your son's belongings will no longer-""

""It doesn't matter. I'm taking my American ass back to my homeland. I don't want your people's ugly manners rubbing off on my kids. If it's not one thing, it's another. You keep making these hollow promises, but here we are again. This little boy has been giving Aizen problems for months now and all you do is let his ill-mannered mother talk to us like we don't understand what she's saying.

""French is their first language, Bitch,"" I turn my attention to the woman. ""And you have taught my very well-behaved son a few words I've had to punish him for. So, no there is no way in hell my kids are staying here for another year. So, thank you for your service. Let's hope none of you are ever treated like shit when you come to the States. But by the looks of both of you. I doubt you'll ever be able to afford it. I'll wait for my daughter and the paperwork outside,""

Aizen jumps off the chair in his little uniform and walks out the door as I hold it open for him. I sit him in the only chair available and notice his undone shoelaces. I start to tie them and look up at him to see he's looking back at me with a smirk.

""Sorry, momma,"" he whispers. I sigh and pull his sock up properly.

""What did he do to you?"" I ask.

""It doesn't matter,"" he shakes his head.

""It matters to me, son. I can't make you feel better if you don't talk to me,"" I brush his dark hair out of his face. He looks down at his sleeve and lifts it. There are three scratches from his wrist to the inside of his elbow. ""Did you show your teacher?""

""They don't care, momma,"" he shrugs. ""I beat him up very well,""

The two of us laugh. I glance over at the kid when his mom walks out of the office. He did beat the kid up. He has a bruise on his cheek and the mark where Aizen bit him on the hand. He's right. From the start, they made it pretty clear where we stood. Not only am I American, but not the pretty blonde-haired hair blue-eyed kind.

My mom was, but not my father, and while I'm not as red as he is, I look a lot like him and so do my kids. The dark hair and the tanned skin. It's a stigma we'll never be able to outrun. Here or back home. But it builds character and my kids have grown used to it.

For the most part, they let their work do all the talking. They're both insanely smart and talented. They know that. I was going to let it go, but these marks might leave a scar. This scandal might just be the final fuck you this country needs.

""Mommy,"" Ayrie runs towards us. Her little body smacks against mine. ""We're going home?""

""Yes,"" I nod. ""Let's get out of here,"" 

# 2

I have no problems with spending our last week in Paris together all day long. When we get home, I clean up Aizen's scratches and put some bandaids on them. It doesn't take much to get them in a better mood. All I had to say was that they weren't ever going back there again.

As I box everything up to send to our new home, I have to admit that I am going to miss this place. This is where they were born. Where I struggled for the first few months as a first-time mom until I met Kendra. Their nanny has been a dream since hiring her. She agreed to move here with me and is more than thrilled to be on the same continent as her family again.

Both Aizen and Ayrie took their first steps here. They both called me Mama for the first time here and I am getting very sentimental now. I go to the bathroom so the kids don't see me cry. Kendra sees me though.

""This will be good for you and them,"" she reminds me. ""Us too,""

""I know. It's just, this was our home for so long,""

""I am very excited for California,"" she laughs.

""I am very excited for the kids to see it too,"" I feel much better.

I take the kids to a couple of museums and the Eiffel Tower one last time so we can say goodbye and have lots of pictures. During our flight, I can't help but feel nervous for some reason. Aizen sleeps through most of it but like me, Ayrie doesn't shut her eyes once.

""Mommy, are we going to see Grandpa again this time?""

""Uh,"" I clear my throat remembering how telling my dad I was a mother of two without telling him the name of their father went. ""Not this time. We're moving there. It's going to be our new home,""

""Is it going to be a regular house this time?"" she asks excitedly.

""It'll be an apartment first. I want to find the perfect house. Would you like to help with that?""

""Will it be by the beach?"" she asks excitedly. I may have mentioned we'd be by the beach.

""Would you like it to be?""

""Yes,"" she nods eagerly. ""We never been to the beach,""

""We can go this weekend while we settle in. It's not too far from our apartment,""

""Oui, s'il vous plaît,"" she giggles and crawls onto my lap. ""Do we still have to talk French?""

""Not if you don't want to. In California mostly everyone speaks English,""

""What do the others speaks?""

""It depends, but where we're going I'd have to say Spanish,""

""We don't know Spanish,"" she curls into me.

""No, well. You don't,"" I laugh.

""You do?"" she gasps.

""I do,"" I nod. ""And so does Kenny,""

""Awesome sauce. I want Kenny to teach me Spanish,""

""You don't want me to teach you?""

""I want you to find the perfect beach house, Mommy. Better than Barbie's,"" she laughs.

""Better than Barbie's, huh?"" I tickle her. She giggles and then wraps her arms around me.

""Are you sad, Mommy?"" she asks.

""Why would you ask that?""

""Because Mrs. Reedly said you must be a sad fuck with two kids and no husband,""

Kendra was in the midst of drinking water. She almost spits it out and starts coughing. I have to fight laughing harder than I ever have in my entire life. I hear a couple of laughs from the other private areas in the first-class lounge. Her little French accent only serves in her favor. 

Mrs. Reedly is probably explaining to her husband that they're being sued by some crazy American woman at the moment along with the school who transferred their son to a different private academy.

""No, Ayrie. I am not sad. You are not allowed to repeat that ever again in your life,"" I finally laugh.

""I promise,"" she giggles. ""Can I go lay down with Bubbie?""

""Yeah, I'll take you,"" I sigh and stand.

I take her over to him and tuck her in next to him. It's crazy how alike they look like this. I cover them and signal Kendra to watch them. She's still bright red. She gives me a thumbs up. It was never a secret. I never told anyone I was married and with how public my profile is, the moms all had their laugh at my expense. So did some of my co-workers.

My boss has been trying to set me up left and right, but I honestly didn't have the time between runways and the kids. Sure, Kendra took a lot of the weight off, but there was no way I was going to end up with a French man. My father would hunt both of us down.

I wash my hands and open the door to get back to my seat. The door across from me opens at the same time and a man steps out before I can.

""Excuse me,"" he says politely.

My heart stops and my ears immediately start to ring. I close my eyes and shake my head. No. There is no fucking way that's him. I step out just enough to watch him go over to the back area furthest away from the twins and then he turns around. It is him. I all but run to my seat.

""You okay?"" Kendra asks when I fall into my seat and grab one of the blankets to cover myself with it as if it would make me disappear.

""This is not happening,"" I whisper to myself.

""Oh, do you need a tampon?"" she whispers.

""What?"" I ask her caught off guard.

""What?"" she asks defensively. ""Why are you all squirrelly, Phoebs?""

""No reason,"" I clear my throat. I reach for a water bottle.

""Phoebe, you're shaking,"" she places her hand over mine. ""Did something happen?""

""No,"" I shake my head. I take a couple of deep breaths. ""I just feel a little light-headed,""

""Here, lie back. You're pale,""

There is no way he'll recognize me. He's on the other side of the plane. It was a long time ago. I don't even have long hair anymore and I'm dressed differently. Right? Right. Oh, my god. What are the odds of this happening? Then again, what are the odds of what happened before happening? The fucking odds are always aligned. Shit.

""I got you some sparkling water,"" Kendra returns with a little green bottle.

""Thank you,"" I take it.

""New home jitters?"" she asks playfully.

""No, just the ghosts of the past,"" I mumble.

""I hear that,"" she sits across from me. I forget she has crazy good hearing.

The twins are up and ready to get off the plane when we land.

There's no way we're going to see him again. At least, that is what I'm telling myself as we get off the plane and head down to get our luggage. As luck has it, I don't see him again. I get my things and set them down as Kendra tells the kids that California is the coolest place in the world and that it's also her first time here.

""Mommy, Chocolate Sprinkles!"" Ayrie calls out and runs off. I look up to see her bear stuck on the belt.

""Watch this,"" I call out Kendra.

""Got it,"" she laughs. The bear's overalls are stuck on the edge of the belt and I can't get it out.

""Excuse me,"" I call out as I struggle. I'm almost to the end of the belt when a hand reaches out and unhooks it. I stumble back making sure nothing happened to my baby's favorite bear. ""Thank you, so much. This my baby's-"" I stop when I see him standing there. ""Favorite bear,""

""You're welcome,"" he smiles. I press my lips together and nod stupidly. ""Do I know you?"" he asks stopping me. ""You seem familiar,""

""Shit,"" I clear my throat.

""It's you,"" he adds quietly. ""My good girl,""

""Fuck,"" I laugh and spin around to face him. ""I was hoping you didn't recognize me,""

""I take offense to that, Angel,"" he smirks.

""Mommy. You found him,"" Ayrie points up at me.

""Huh?"" my mind glitches for a second and then I realize what she's talking about when she snatches the bear out of my hands.

""I'm sorry, Chocolate Sprinkles,"" she says dusting his overalls and then hugs him tightly.

""Momma, my strap came apart,"" Aizen comes over to me holding out his carry-on.

""I told you to stop tugging on it,"" I remind him. He laughs and holds it up so I can fix it.

""You have two,"" Knighty looks between them. He looks stunned.

""Yeah, these are my kids. Aizen and Ayrie,"" I say mindlessly. Why did I say that to him?

""You're the guy from the TV,"" Ayrie shouts excitedly. I cover her mouth and pull her to me.

""Oh, my god! It's Knightly Blake,"" someone screams.

""Just like her Mom, huh?"" he steps back and pulls his hoodie over his head. ""I'll see you around, Phoebe,""

""Kenny,"" I call out picking up Ayrie.

She lifts up Aizen and we grab our things trying to dodge the people running past us. God, that was a good save, baby girl. People swarm past us as we try to get the hell out of there. We make it to the exit to find our driver holding up a sign with my last name on it. We hurry over to him. He leads us out to his van. Two car seats are waiting inside for us. I don't hesitate to hide the twins.

""You know Knightly Blake?"" Kendra asks when we're finally moving. ""How?""

""I don't want to talk about it,"" I shake my head and try to catch my breath.

""That's nuts,"" she laughs. ""I fucking hate that guy,""

""You're not supposed to say that word,"" Aizen scolds her.

""Right,"" she nods. ""I hate him,""

Knightly

I didn't think I'd ever see her again. Phoebe. I never really got over our encounter. It's not every day one meets their soulmate like that. To say it surprises me that she's married and has kids is an understatement.

We didn't really talk much that night, but our connection was instant. The way she said my name. How she touched me. She asked for nothing in return after she let me have her every way I could think of. The vinyl was the only thing I could leave behind. Had I stayed and let her wake up, things would have ended badly for both of us. Has she thought of me since then?

She's as beautiful as the first time I ran into her. This encounter is as bad as the last one. That itch I thought had disappeared is stirring and I don't want it to.

""You made a scene at the airport,"" Pete says and drops into the armchair across from me.

""I ran into someone,"" I explain.

""Do tell,"" Rip pushes my leg off his coffee table. His wife glares at me.

""Sorry,"" I apologize and sit up straight.

""Who was it?"" she asks.

""Do you guys remember the girl from six years ago?""

""The girl that inspired the album that followed?"" Pete laughs. ""Yeah, we remember Phoebe,""

""That's who I ran into,""

""What?"" they all sit up. I laugh at their reaction.

""Did you at least get her number?"" Rip smacks my leg.

""No, I didn't, and even if I had. She's married now. Has two kids,""

""Aww,"" Felicity taps my knee. ""That sucks, man,""

""Yeah,"" it really fucking does.

""Did she get fat at least?"" Pete scoffs. We all laugh.

""Not even a little. She cut her hair. She looked so fucking good,"" I admit and sit back. ""Her daughter looks just like her,""

""That's cute. What did you say her name was?"" Felicity asks.

""Phoebe,"" Pete answers.

""Let's see who the lucky fuck that married her is,"" she laughs. ""Do we have a last name?""

""The sign her driver was carrying read Altaha,"" I say.

""She's native?"" Pete asks.

""I think so. Mixed maybe. She has dark blue eyes. Like navy blue eyes,"" I nod. They all laugh at me. That was sappy, even for me.

""Are you sure? All that comes up with that name is the new CEO of Royal Threads in SoCal,""

""What? Wait, that might be her. She said she was a clothes designer when we met. She had drawings all over her suite,""

""No, fucking way,"" she laughs and hands me her phone.

""That's her,"" I nod. They all bunch in around us to get a look at her. Wow, she's really got her shit together.

""Dude, she is so fucking hot,"" Pete nods.

""I'd think about that all day long too, if I were you,"" Rip momentarily forgets his wife is in the room and gets a slap to the back of the head. ""Sorry, baby,""

""Aww, they're so fucking cute,"" she wiggles next to me. ""Oh, look at the little boy. He has a guitar,"" she switches the picture to the kid sitting on her lap while she strums the guitar for him when he's about one or two. The baby loves it. ""Oh, my god. He plays,"" she moves to the next video. It's the boy as old as he is now playing a baby blue electric guitar customized for him. ""Did she try to make him look like you?""

""Her husband,"" I roll my eyes.

""I don't see one,"" she says as she continues to scroll through. ""Wait, here,"" my stomach clenches when she stops. ""This is from like three years ago,""

I still don't like the picture. Some guy has his arms around her. He's looking up at the camera but the look she's giving him implies they're more than just friends. It shouldn't bother me. It's not like she belongs to me. In fact, I don't really know anything about her except that she's fucking phenomenal in bed.

""I don't think she's married,"" Pete says as Felicity scrolls through her Instagram. ""Hey, it's you,""

They hold the phone out for me. The picture we took outside the elevator comes up. We're both laughing. I hadn't laughed like that in a long time. Before her, things were a little bleak. I had nothing. I had never had writer's block like that and I haven't had it again since.

""That was a good night,"" I admit. They all laugh.

""If you see her again, check for a ring,"" Rip smacks my chest.

""I am going to get some rest. That was a long flight,"" I say and get up. ""Sorry about the mess today,""

They all dismiss me. I take a hot shower and get into bed. It gets the better of me and I reach for my laptop. I type her name in and a whole lot of out of my league pops up on the screen. Fashion shows, fashion awards, fashion articles, pictures of her on magazine covers, and a whole lot of success.

One article catches my attention. It's about her rise to the top. How she overcame the struggles as a single mom. A single mom? How does that happen? Who in their right mind would leave her like that? This girl is a whole ten with no buts.

Then I see how old they are. I laugh for a moment. Her kids are five years old. Five plus nine months is almost six whole years. My heart starts to race and I sit up. I go back to her QuickHowl and scrolled down to the picture of us. 

There are over a hundred pictures above it before there's a picture of an ultrasound. I reach for my wallet to check the napkin with the drawing of a dress I stole from her. She had written the date at the bottom left-hand corner and I start to feel sick to my stomach.

""Knightly,"" Peter barges into my room. I immediately slam my laptop shut. Maybe a little too hard. ""You're not jacking off, right?""

""What? Of course, not,""

""Whatever, sick ass. Dude, I was stalking your girlfriend,""

""Not my girlfriend,"" I shake my head.

""Her kids are five, my man,"" he jumps into the bed with me. ""Wouldn't it be fucking crazy if they were yours?"" he laughs. ""What were you doing, liar?""

""Nothing,"" I shake my head. He snatches my laptop. ""You were stalking her,"" he opens the laptop and then shows me. ""You cracked your screen, dumbass,""

""Fuck,"" I take it from him. I don't know how that happened. My wolf has been dormant for years.

""If you weren't stalking. It was porn,"" he declares.

""Get out of my room,"" I toss the laptop on the floor. He laughs and heads to the door.

""It was porn,"" he nods sure of himself. I take a throw pillow and launch it at him. He closes the door before it can hit him.

""Holy shit,"" I sit up and try to take even breaths. ""You fucking didn't do that,""

Taking what she said into consideration and the way she reacted to our situation, the probabilities are more than just a little high. I open up the app on my phone and scroll up the video of the little boy playing the guitar.

I didn't get a good look at him at the airport because everything happened so fast and I was a little in awe about all of her. She looks amazing. The little pink outfit she was wearing hugged her body astonishingly. And the hair looks good. It frames her face into a perfect heart shape.

Even before I am fully awake, I know that this is going to be a day from hell and I have had enough of those in my life.

If just one more thing in my life goes wrong, I am out of here and I will never set foot in this territory again.

“Did the bond form?” I ask Charna, my Lycan. If it did, it would make my day better, or at least I hope so.

“It did form.” She replies, but her tone tells me something is wrong.

I turned eighteen a week ago and found a connection with the future Alpha, Nico, one of the people on my list for hurting me over and over again.

No, he never hit me and neither did anyone else.

Okay, maybe I need to explain something for you to understand what I am talking about.

On my sixth birthday I had been at the lake with my Father, who is our Pack’s Beta, and the Alpha and Gamma family. I had gotten bored with the games they were playing, and I had wandered off into the forest; most of our territory is forest.

I knew to keep an eye out for the markings that tell us where our borders are and I had been picking wild flowers as I walked around. A soft whimper had gotten my attention and being the curious little Beta, I had gone looking for the source.

If only I had known that I would come to hate my sixth birthday one day, I might have walked in the opposite direction.

I had found a girl in the forest. Later, it turned out that she was just a little older than me, and I had taken her to our Alpha.

Her name was Lucy, but she couldn’t tell us how she had gotten here or where she had come from. She did know that her birthday had just been a few days ago or would be in a few days, and that had been the first time that she had gotten something that was mine.

“You have so many dolls, why don’t you give one to Lucy?” my Father had asked and as I had thought about which doll to gift her, I had nodded my head.

My Father had grabbed my favorite doll from the picnic blanket and as I had objected to it, my Father had already given it to Lucy.

I had tried to explain to my Father that I didn’t want to part with that specific doll, but he had just said that I was being selfish, and he had placed Lucy next to him on the blanket.

Lucy had lived on the first floor with the Omegas for about a week, when my Father had moved Lucy to our floor. He had said that Lucy didn’t like living with the Omegas, and she had asked my Father if she could come live with us.

I doubt nowadays that she used the word “us” back then, but I wasn’t there when she had asked and therefore I can’t be sure.

Every birthday I had was overshadowed by Lucy, my Father always telling me that she didn’t have parents to throw her a party and I could just share my party with Lucy.

This happened again and again, not only due to my Father but also due to the Alpha and Gamma families. Nico was the worst, and he would always remind me that Lucy was much prettier than me, at least in his eyes.

So, now you might understand why Nico is on my shit list.

I train every single day because I have to because I am the future Beta. Well, I was the future Beta, and now I am going to be the future Luna.

Nico had been as surprised as I was, but he wanted to form a bond with me. After all, the Goddess had made the connection, and we needed to respect her decision.

Lucy hadn’t been too happy with it; she had been trying to get Nico’s attention for almost a year now and had failed miserably. She even went out of her way to make sure I knew that she would never accept me as a Luna and I had just laughed in her face.

Being Nico’s Mate will make me the Luna, and Lucy cannot do anything about it, even though she might try.

I have gone through my morning routine and am rinsing the dishes I used for breakfast. I hardly ever eat breakfast in the main dining room, because I usually train during that time.

I see that the door to the master bedroom is wide open, which means that my Father is already downstairs, probably having an early morning meeting with the rest of our leadership.

“Why are you so quiet?” I ask Charna, this should be a joyous day for both of us.

She doesn’t answer me, but the moment I leave the Beta floor, she starts pacing in my head and forces me to head up to the Alpha floor. I enter the floor using the code I was given after I turned sixteen, and I am met with complete silence.

It seems I was right about the early morning meeting, and Nico is using it to sleep in, just like he does every time his parents are preoccupied or absent.

I hadn’t made any plans with Nico, even though we knew that today would probably be the day that our Mate-bond would be completed. Charna doesn’t understand why we didn’t make any plans, and to tell you the truth, neither do I.

My steps falter as I stand in front of Nico’s bedroom door and I am glad that our bond hadn’t formed earlier. If it had and we had accepted one another as Mates, I would be in excruciating pain right now.

Because the Asshole is fucking another female, the sounds coming from his room don’t leave any room for errors and I am not sure what to do right now.

“Is this why he didn’t want to tell anyone just yet?” Charna asks me and I think we both know that that is exactly the reason.

“Ohh, Lucy. That feels so good.” I hear Nico groan, but it is the name he called that has made me furious and I can barely manage to keep myself from bursting in. I need to find a way to expose those two, and slowly, I make my way out of the Alpha floor and back to my own room without shedding a tear.

I am going to make them pay for what they did and everyone will know about our connection, but it ends today.

# New Life

I walk into my bedroom and grab my suitcases from the back of my closet; I place them on my bed to start packing the remainder of my belongings. There are only a few sets of clothes left in my closet and only the daily necessities in the bathroom.

Most of the things I want to take with me are already in my suitcases. I made the decision to leave Shadow Valley Pack at my Sweet Sixteen party, and I already know where I am going.

I will be going to the Elders to learn everything I need to learn to become the best Beta I can be, and I will find a Pack that will appreciate me for who I am.

My weapons are in the trunk of my car; I take them out every time I need them and place them back after I have cleaned them. All that is left is my luggage, and then I will make sure that everyone understands who is responsible for me leaving.

Okay, let’s get introductions out of the way. My name is Dallas, I am eighteen years old and my Lycan, Charna, showed up a year ago. My life hasn’t been a bed of roses and the only reason I stayed this long is the hope of finding my Mate.

Well, we already know that that didn’t go as planned. I am officially done with the people in my life and the leadership of this Pack.

I walk back up to the Alpha floor, and to my surprise, Nico and Lucy are still at it, but I no longer give a damn.

“Nico, harder.” I hear Lucy moan. “Put a Pup in me, I want you to cum inside me.” I can hear Nico groan before he yells that he is coming.

I slam open the door, and Lucy drops to the floor when Nico pushes her off his cock, startled by my presence. Both make a mess of themselves and the bedroom.

I don’t wait for him to respond; I just turn on my heel and walk down the hallway to the door.

“Please, Dallas. Stop. This is not what it looks like; it just happened.” Nico says, hopping on one leg as he tries to pull on some sweatpants.

I don’t say anything; I just keep walking down the stairs, and I know that Nico and Lucy are right behind me.

Everyone in the main dining room goes quiet the moment they see me walking in, and I can hear a few whispers the moment Nico and Lucy walk in behind me; everyone can smell the scent of sex in the air.

“I, Dallas, reject you, Nico, as my Mate.” I say after I have turned around to look at him.

“I don’t care if you accept it or not. Just know that it won’t stop me from finding my own happiness and you will have to suffer the consequences of not accepting my rejection.” I state.

“Dallas, why are you rejecting our Son?” Alpha Leon asks and I turn around to look at him.

“Because, as usual, Lucy wanted what is mine and got it. Your Son fucked Lucy, even though he knew that our Mate-bond was nearly complete and now I know why he didn’t want us to tell anyone.” I say as I look into Alpha Leon’s eyes.

I turn back to Lucy and Nico, he is still staring at me and his hands are pressed against his chest. I don’t feel any pain, but that might change if he accepts my rejection.

“You wanted him; you can have him. You can have everything that was once mine. I hope that the two of you become very happy together, and I hope that you enjoy your victory.” I say to Lucy before I walk past her and out of the main dining room.

“Stop, you can’t leave. You are my Mate.” Nico says and I turn around to see him standing in the doorway.

“I am no longer your Mate. You chose to sleep with her, and now you can deal with the consequences. You have always put Lucy before me, just like your family, the Gamma family and even my own Father. You never failed to remind me that you thought that Lucy was prettier than I am.

Our Mate-bond would have made you see that you had been wrong, that you had hurt me with your words, and I would have forgiven you because of our Mate-bond. What I can’t forgive and what I will never forgive, is that you chose to fuck another woman.” I say in a calm, cold voice.

The entire dining room is quiet and everyone is waiting for what is coming next.

“Dallas, there might be a very good explanation…” But I don’t give Alpha Leon the chance to finish his sentence.

“What kind of explanation can your Son have for being buried balls deep in Lucy? Where in this damn universe could this have been an accident?” I growl in his direction.

More Pack-members have gathered in the dining room, all of them curious about the drama unfolding in front of them.

My Father finally gets up from his chair and I am damn curious about what he will have to say.

“Dallas, you are the future Beta. You already have status within Shadow Valley Pack; why not grant Lucy the status of Luna?” My Father says.

Charna is growling in my head, but she keeps to the back of my mind. Neither one of us wants him to know that we already shifted or that we know that he lied about our Mother.

“HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU WANT ME TO GIVE LUCY MY MATE, JUST LIKE YOU GAVE HER THE LAST GIFT MOM GAVE ME OR THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME ON MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY.

GET A FUCKING GRIP ON THAT DAMN BRAIN OF YOURS, I HATE YOUR FUCKING GUTS.” I yell at my Father and I take advantage of his shocked state.

“Nico, this is your last chance to accept my rejection. Once I walk out the door, you might never get the chance again.” I state, looking at Nico and it seems to sink in that no one can change my mind.

“I, Nico, accept your rejection.” Nico says, knowing that I will never forgive him.

I walk out of the Pack-house without looking back; I get into my SUV to finally get out of this place and start my new life.

# At Fault

Dallas’ p.o.v.

Six months later

I took my time to travel to Scarlet Crescent Pack. I needed time to myself, and I wanted to take time to write down all the questions I have had for years.

I arrived at my destination after traveling for almost a week.

Charna enjoyed running around in unknown territory and neither one of us feel sorry for ourselves.

It is almost as if there never was a bond between me and Nico, no pain after he accepted our rejection and no sense of loss for us.

I arrived at Scarlet Crescent Pack in the early morning, and I am glad that I had the letter from the Elders printed; it saved a lot of trouble at the gate.

A Squad Captain was waiting for me at the main building, the building that houses the Elders and where I will get my education.

I was given a schedule for the first week and then he showed me the territory we were staying in.

We might live within Scarlet Crescent territory, but we can’t enter the territory that surrounds the Palace. At least not with permission from the Elders or at the request of the King.

I had the rest of the day off, and I used it to get settled in; my room is on the top floor of building A. It is a hell of a lot bigger than my room back home and I even have a small balcony.

I placed my laptop on the desk next to the balcony door, I unpacked my suitcases and then I went looking for some breakfast.

My first real day with the Elders consisted of tests to establish the level of my knowledge of Laws and my skill level in fighting.

I aced every test they gave me, and that left the Elders with a challenge: where do you place someone who hardly needs basic training?

After consulting with the Squad Captains, I was assigned to one of the Squads and a costume made study plan was devised.

My studies were more focused on Pack-laws and the consequences they could have for a Pack. It was something I wasn’t taught in Shadow Valley Pack; I didn’t even know that an Alpha could make his own Laws within his territory.

Those Laws can’t be breaking our main Laws; they are usually a stricter version of our main Laws, and I was going to need to learn all of them.

I found a few surprises along the way, and I actually enjoyed my studies; they were very educational.

Today, I will become a fully pledged member of Captain Jordan’s Squad, and I will be allowed to go on missions with the Squad; my main priority is to make sure we know the Pack-laws of the territories we get sent to.

“Good morning, Dallas.” Captain Jordan says as I walk into the living room of our Squad house.

The other Squad members greet me with a smile or a wave and I walk over to the coffee machine to make myself a Latte.

Captain Jordan slides a file in my direction after I have taken a seat not far from him, and I reluctantly open it. I know what is in there and hate it whenever he hands me a file like this.

Captain Jordan was the first one who found out about my past; he had found me cussing and swearing at a phone that was lying on the desk in my room.

It was on my third day as a part of his Squad and I hadn’t come down yet, so he came looking for me. I had finally turned on the old phone with my sim card in it and I had many text and voice messages from my Father.

None of them were an apology for the way he had treated me. No, each of them was telling me that I was childish, selfish, and immature.

Captain Jordan took the phone from me, and once a month, I get a file on the type of messages I have gotten with the name of whoever left them for me.

My Father still leaves messages telling me I am being childish, selfish and immature. Nico is begging me to come back, to give him another chance and so do his parents. The only one that hasn’t reached out to me is Lucy and I hope she never does.

My eyes widen when I read a different message from my Father, and I hear Charna laughing in my head; I had completely forgotten about this.

“Something funny, Dallas?” I hear Captain Jordan ask and I need a minute before I can answer him.

“Sorry, but it is the last message from my Father.” I reply and I hear a few growls around me.

“I had forgotten that I had changed the password to the program for the Pack funds. I never informed anyone about it, and it slipped my mind that it is the annual fund meeting in a few days.” I explain, but apparently, I am not making any sense.

“Every Pack makes an annual budget for a variety of Pack-related issues; I have been making them since I turned fifteen, and my Father would pass them off as his own. He never needed access to the program, so he never needed the new password and now the only ones that can get access are Alpha Leon and his Mate.” I explain.

Captain Jordan has a dumbfounded look on his face and looking around; I can see he isn’t the only one.

“Can’t your Father ask Alpha Leon for the password?” I hear Elder Jensen ask.

“And tell Alpha Leon that he hasn’t done any of the financial tasks he was supposed to do?” I ask in return.

I hear almost everyone laughing around me, understanding that this would mean losing face for a Beta and no one would want to lose face in front of his Alpha.

“Besides, my Father would never admit that he was at fault. No matter the evidence against him.” I say.

# Our Mother

Daxton’s p.o.v.

“Good morning, Daxton.” I hear Carl, our future Alpha, say. I doubt it is a good morning if he is standing behind me, he only comes looking for me if someone told him to come and get me.

“Who sent you?” I ask him as I turn to face him. I want to look into his eyes when he answers me; it will tell me if he is aware of why he was sent here.

“My Mother, I believe it has to do with an invitation from Shadow Valley Pack. Between you and me, I think Dad might order you to go.” Carl answers and I know that he is telling the truth.

I am forty-seven, and I still haven’t found my true Mate-bond; I never met a woman my Lycan felt a connection with. I have been waiting for twenty-nine years to find that connection, but so far, I haven’t been able to find her, and I gave up on finding her years ago.

The people around me are still hoping that I will find her one day; they want me to go to other Packs to look for her. I did that for over a decade with no results and now I no longer want to go through it.

“I am sorry, Daxton. Mom wants you at the Pack-house for lunch on the Alpha floor.” Carl says, and I know that he is sorry; our entire future leadership understands me.

None of them have found their true Mate-bond yet and they have to attend as many events as the Pack gets invited to.

I reluctantly follow Carl to the Pack-house; there is no point in shooting the messenger. I am not sure how this lunch will go, but something tells me I will have given everyone a piece of my mind before it ends.

Chatter is coming from the dining room and I can already hear my Mother’s voice above the others.

“If he doesn’t find his Mate during that Alpha Ceremony, he will need to take Daniella as his chosen Mate.” Mom says and even though I am not in the room, I know the smirk Daniella will have on her face.

“I will never take Daniella as my chosen Mate. If and that is a big IF I take a chosen Mate, I will decide who becomes my chosen Mate. You don’t have a say in it, Mother.” I say calmly, knowing that this annoys the hell out of her.

Not just my tone of voice but also the fact that I use the word Mother instead of Mom.

No one says a word as I sit down across the table from my Mother and Daniella; both of them have an annoyed look on their face. Carl sits down in the seat that was meant for me, next to Daniella.

“What is this I hear about an invitation, Luna?” I ask, ensuring everyone understands I know why I was summoned.

“Shadow Valley Pack will get another Alpha in about seven months; we got invited to attend and to bring along some of our unmated Pack-members.” Our Luna answers and I know there is no way I am getting away with refusing to go.

“I didn’t know that Nico had found his connection yet and why does Alpha Leon think it is smart to hand over the Pack so soon?” I ask the question that is probably running through everyone’s mind.

We had all met Nico over the years and he didn’t strike me as the most competent for the Alpha position, not to mention the woman who was always with him. If I am not mistaken, her name is Lucy, but we never found out what her rank is or who her parents are.

The last time Nico was here was about four months ago, and we all had felt that something was off that day. We never figured out what was wrong, but the guy had been jumpy throughout the entire visit and he had eyed every woman in the Pack with suspicion until he was able to see their faces.

“None of us knew he had found a connection until the invitation arrived, that is. As to why Alpha Leon is so eager to step down, any guess could be a good one.” Our Luna answers.

Usually, when a future Alpha finds his connection, his parents make it known to every Pack and not just the allied Packs.

For his parents not to make it known immediately can only mean a few things. He could have gotten someone pregnant who isn’t his true Mate-bond, he could have taken a chosen Mate for an alliance, or he could have broken the connection to his first Mate for whatever reason.

“Why don’t you accompany Daxton to the Alpha Ceremony, Daniella?” My Mother asks, but luckily our Luna quickly shoots that idea down.

“Sorry, but we have chosen the unmated Pack-members already. Daniella is still young and has all the time in the world to find her connection. We will be bringing Pack-members that have been waiting at least five years to find their connection.” Our Luna responds and I can tell that she is telling the truth.

“We did that on purpose, Daxton.” She tells me through the mind-link, and for once, I am grateful that our Luna can be conning from time to time.

Unlike most, our Luna isn’t afraid to talk back to my Mother. My Mother knows that most still consider her this Pack’s Beta female and that means she gets away with a lot of her behavior, but even my Mother isn’t stupid enough to go against our Luna.

Our Luna has the final say and no one is going to argue with her about it, not even me.

My Mother and Daniella don’t seem to be too pleased with our Luna, but my twin Brother, Darius, has a damn smirk on his face and hell breaks loose the moment he opens his mouth.

“You seem eager to have her as a Daughter in law. Why don’t I take Daniella as my chosen Mate?” Darius says with a smirk on his face.

Yeah, leave it to my twin Brother to piss off our Mother.

# Missing Something?

Darius’ p.o.v.

The moment the invitation came in, I knew it would mean trouble between my Mother and my twin Brother.

And yes, I say my Mother for a reason. Daxton might be my twin Brother, but she always treated him less than me, and for the first ten years of our lives, we even believed that we were separated by a whole year.

It wasn’t until our former Alpha overheard a conversation between me and Daxton that we were told that we were twins.

It explained quite a lot of things to both of us, and Daxton has pulled away from our Mother ever since; there even was a time he refused to acknowledge that she was his Mother.

We still don’t understand why she favors me over Daxton and we both doubt that we will ever find out.

I listen to the words my Mother speaks, but I don’t respond and I don’t have to. Daxton can take care of himself, but I am starting to get agitated by Mother’s relentless quest to get Daxton to take a chosen Mate and preferably Daniella.

None of us likes Daniella; it goes back to our childhood, and she hasn’t given us a reason yet to change our minds.

Daniella is the Granddaughter of a former Elder and she was always after Preston. No matter what anyone told her, she kept going after him and we thought she might trick him into a chosen Mate-bond.

Daxton, Rayden and I would always be with Preston and we have seen Daniella try a few desperate things to get into Preston’s bed, but thank the Goddess that she never succeeded. It would have been this Pack’s downfall and one of us would have been charged with murder.

Mother stares at me when I suggest that I take Daniella as a chosen Mate; I know she doesn’t think Daniella is good enough to be a Beta’s Mate, and she will object to my suggestion.

“Darius, that is ridiculous. Daniella is not cut out to be a Beta’s Mate; she would never be able to support you the way you need your Mate to support you.” Mother replies and I see a devilish look in Rayden’s eyes.

“Then she isn’t suited to be Daxton’s Mate either; after all, they are twins, and that makes Daxton also a Beta.” Rayden states and normally I would say that no one can argue with that, but I know how my Mother feels about Daxton and Beta in the same sentence.

“Darius is Silver Eclipse’s Beta; Daxton holds no title. Daniella can be his chosen Mate, but not that of my little boy.” My Mother growls and I know Rayden is going to spill the beans.

“What do you mean with Daxton holds no title? I thought that twins always shared everything, their Mate and their rank.” Ruth, Rayden’s Mate, asks.

“Nice safe, Rayden.” I hear Preston say over our mind-link.

I would like to hear how my Mother is going to get herself out of this pickle; either she acknowledges that Daxton is also a Beta, or she has to tell a lie.

Daniella has had a disgusted look on her face since Ruth mentioned that twins share a Mate, it seems like she hadn’t taken that into consideration.

“You are right, Ruth. A twin usually shares a Mate and a rank, but Daxton made a mess of his life at the age of twenty. It is a shameful period and I don’t like to get reminded of it. I told Preston that Daxton’s status had been damaged and that only Darius had a right to the Beta of Silver Eclipse Pack.” My Mother answers Ruth.

Ruth looks at Daxton for a very long time and I know that he is getting uncomfortable by the way she is looking at him.

“I’m sorry for staring, Daxton. I am just trying to see the monster because only a monster wouldn’t deserve his rank or a true Mate-bond. I will let you know when I have found that monster, even though I have a feeling that I am looking in the wrong direction.” Ruth says.

Daxton is trying to hide his laughter, but I am not even trying. Ruth knows what to say and when to say it; she always manages to lighten up a tense situation.

“Ruth, I don’t like what you are implying…..” My Mother starts to say, but Ruth just raises her hand to shut her up.

“I am not implying anything. It is just a result of the information that you gave me; the only thing I could come up with is that whatever Daxton did must have painted him as a monster and nothing less. I can’t see that monster in him and I doubt his Mate will.” Ruth replies and I see Daxton shaking with laughter.

Our Mother isn’t used to someone interrupting her or telling her how they feel about her, and Ruth doesn’t have a problem doing both.

“Daxton will never find his connection after all these years; it is time he accepts the fact that he will never have a true Mate-bond.” My Mother says and I have to grit my teeth to keep quiet.

“Okay, let’s see if I can get this straight. You believe that Daxton will never find his Mate, but that also means that Darius will never find his Mate. Because Daxton will never find his Mate, you want him to take a chosen Mate and that means that Darius needs to find a chosen Mate too.

They are twins, and that means sharing a Mate; maybe Daniella is willing to take two Mates. Oh, hold on. Her face tells me enough; she is disgusted by the idea of having two Mates. This leaves me with one last question: why settle for the twin that has no right to a high rank according to his Mother?” Ruth states, her eyes locked with those of my Mother.

Damn, that woman is good. She managed to ask a question that has eluded me all these years.

My Mother is looking a little pale, and Daniella looks as if she is about to throw up; why does that deduction from Ruth unsettle them so much? Have I been missing something all these years?

# Goddess' Gift

Dallas’ p.o.v.

Okay, this is not what I had been expecting. I don’t believe anyone in our Squad had seen it coming and I am still a little baffled.

Captain Jordan announced his retirement at the ceremony that would make me a fully pledged member of the Squad, but it turned out to go a little differently after his announcement.

Elder Jensen had appointed me as the new Squad Captain and everyone had started cheering for me, but I had been unable to say a word. I have been here a little over six months and now I have my own Squad.

I know there have been a few others who made Squad Captain within a year of arriving, but I am not sure if this is what I want or need in my life at the moment.

I mean, it is an honor that they believe that I can handle this. There is a downside to it, though. I might have to visit Shadow Valley Pack, and I am not sure if I am ready for that at the moment.

“Captain, Elder Jensen wants to see you. He is waiting in your office.” Joshua, my second in command, says and I wonder why Elder Jensen didn’t link me. “You have your block up, Captain.”

I smile at Joshua as I walk out of my room; I didn’t just take over as Captain; I also got Jordan’s room, and that means living on the other side of the top floor. Joshua follows me to my office on the first floor and everyone we pass slightly bows their heads, a sign of respect for my position.

“I wish they wouldn’t do that; it makes me feel uncomfortable. I am still the same person as before, and now the same people who ignored me suddenly show me respect.” I say to Joshua as another woman slightly bows her head.

“It will become even worse; they will start to talk to you.” He replies teasingly and Charna is laughing her ass off.

I softly growl at Joshua, and he is smart enough to create a little distance between us. He is one of the few people in our Squad that knows about what other members of other Squads have said to me, each and every one of them implicating that I was Jordan’s lover.

It wasn’t until someone said that I had to go and find my own true Mate-bond, that I lost control of my patients and Charna. That fucking Idiot is still in the infirmary and once he has fully recovered, he gets sent home.

No one has dared to make a similar remark to me ever since, but I have gotten enough death glares and I prefer it that way. My Squad members know that I got where I am because of all the hard work I put into it, and none of them question my ability to lead this Squad.

“Elder Jensen, I apologize for having my block up. I was just finishing up for my last exam and I didn’t want to get distracted.” I say as I sit down behind my desk.

“No worries, I knew you were studying. I wanted to do this personally and in private; I know this will be difficult for you, and it might not.” Elder Jensen says.

Joshua and I are looking at one another, this guy is talking in riddles and I don’t think I have the patience for it today.

Elder Jensen holds out an envelope for me and after a small hesitation, I take it from his outstretched hand. I recognize the Pack emblem and my first instinct is to throw it back at Elder Jensen, but my curiosity wins.

We are proud to announce the Alpha Ceremony for our Son, Nico, and the Luna Ceremony for his Mate, Lucy.

I don’t bother reading the rest of the card. I close the card before putting it in the envelope, and I hand it back to Elder Jensen.

“We both know that Nico and Lucy don’t have a true Mate-bond and that causes an issue for the Elders, but we also want to send out a message to every other Pack in the Kingdom. So, we will wait until the Ceremony, and you will get the honor of telling them that the Alpha Ceremony is canceled.” Elder Jensen says.

Joshua looks at me for a moment before he seems to understand why I am getting the honor of disrupting an Alpha Ceremony.

“How long do we have?” I ask Elder Jensen, I need to prepare myself mentally.

“You have over six months to prepare; you know the rules for an Alpha or Luna Ceremony cancellation. Also, make sure that there is a trial date for Alpha Leon, just in case he is willing to fight our decision in front of the King.” Elder Jensen replies.

“Okay, Joshua. Let’s get this Shitshow on the road; I want the cancellation forms filled out. Alpha Leon will ask for them and he will ask for a trial to overturn their own Pack-law.” I say as I show Elder Jensen to the door.

I open the door to let Elder Jensen out and I see my third in command, Jesper, waiting outside the door.

“Get in here, Jesper. We have more than enough to do and, luckily, a whole lot of time to do it in. I do need some answers, though, and maybe you can help me with that.” I say as Jesper walks into my office.

Joshua hands him the envelope and I softly growl at the mere sight of the Pack emblem on it.

For a few moments, it is quiet in my office, but then Jesper starts laughing his ass off.

“Let me guess, we get to break up the happy shindig?” He asks and starts laughing even harder. Someone seems to be happy to be a party pooper and I actually have to giggle.

I decide to tell both of them why I get the privilege of dealing with the cancellation and both men growl loudly.

Jesper went through a similar situation and Joshua had his connection broken before there was a chance to form a bond.

Why Nico chose Lucy over me is still unknown; Jesper and Joshua both know why they were turned down. Neither of them had a high enough rank; both women wanted an Alpha.

Well, good luck. Most Alphas are arrogant, obnoxious, and rude; they truly believe that they are the Goddess’ gift to women.

I don't have a good name for this yet but if you have one, I'm all ears!

• 1½ oz yuzu juice

• 1½ oz simple syrup

• 1 oz lychee liqueur

• 5 oz coconut fat washed rum

• 3 oz milk

• 3 oz green tea

• standard milk wash procedure

• yuzu bitters to serve

• coconut white chocolate garnish

**Coconut fat washed rum.** 5oz white rum with 1oz coconut oil. Mix together in mason jar and let it sit overnight. I would shake it ocassionally whenever I walk past it through the day. Put it in freezer to allow coconut oil to solidify and strain through fine mesh.

**Yuzu juice**. If you can find yuzu in your local market, I envy you and please do get fresh ones. Juice them and strain. Get as much oil from the skin as you can. If not, your local Asian grocer should have some bottled.

**Milk**. Full cream milk is best.

**Yuzu bitters**. I used The Japanese Bitters.

**Green tea.** Brew as per package instructions. I prefer loose leaf compared to bagged but use what you can get your hands on. Don't worry about over brewing since milk washing will remove a lof of the tannins.

**Simple syrup**. 50g sugar + 50g water. Boil or blend with stick blender until dizzolved. If you can get fresh yuzu fruits, I think making an oleo saccharum yuzu syrup would be pretty good!

**Milk wash**. Combine yuzu juice, syrup, coconut washed rum, and green tea in one container. Milk in another contained. Pour combination into milk container stirring constantly. Allow to sit for an hour. Strain through coffee filter, do not discard the residue. Pour the filtrate through the residue again to double filter for a crystal clear produce.

**Coconut white chocolate garnish.** 90g white chocolate chopped and divided into 1/3 and 2/3 pile. Double boil the 2/3 pile until melted, remove from heat, allow to cool slightly, then place the remaining 1/3 pile in to stir and incorporate. Spread over a baking sheet and sprinkle toasted dessicated coconut over. Allow to set. There are better tempering instructions out there that will probably yield better results but this is the bare basics of it.

**To serve.** Build in glass. Large ice format. 3-4 oz straight into glass with 2 dashes yuzu bitters.",1,1754119091.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

The ViJohn blade was on its 3rd use and held up decently, though it needed some buffing. Could’ve stretched it for one more shave, but I decided to retire it early. GWS Chinese blades are next in line for the test run.

I'm an anti, more or less. I think we shouldn't use AI recreationally, and frankly, I don't think we should've built a system that necessitated it in the first place. However, now that it's here, rather than denying its existence, I think we should define terms.

In my opinion (and I think this should be standard), art requires a substantial amount of human creativity. I don't know what that threshold is, and I don't think we'll ever know, but at the bare minimum, some sapient being must have a heavy hand in creating a piece in order to call it art and to call them the artist.

The term ""art"" is subjective, but subjectivity doesn't equal anarchy. Art isn't just any thing ever. Someone's Post-It note telling Brenda to fill the coffee machine at 8 o'clock sharp isn't art, just like the product of a three-word prompt asking AI to create a ""pretty catgirl dancing"" isn't art. While it may look pretty visually, it conveys about the same amount of artistic intent as the Post-It note. Both used their mind to create a string of letters whose output evoked a response in someone else. However, neither are art, because art requires great artistic intent and action.

AI isn't always ""just a tool."" It, based on its training and the words of your prompt, converts your prompt into an entirely unique image that has never been created before. That's not tool behavior. To go against Albert Einstein's words, with a tool, doing the same thing and expecting different results is the definition of insanity. In especially low-effort cases AI is a replacement rather than a tool.

But if you create a detailed prompt, inpaint, and/or curate, then you've used AI as a tool, because you've achieved your creative vision with the use of a thing that you assured did not deviate from it. That's more likely to be art, I think. Art can just be a pretty picture, but to what extent of art it is and to whom that pretty picture belongs requires intent and effort.

Art isn't black-and-white. It's a spectrum. And I think rejecting AI-*only* images as art isn't gatekeeping, but an effort not to dilute the meaning of ""art."" And if AI artists really want to be called an artist by their anti peers, I suggest sticking their hand in the mud that is the ""art"" part if they haven't already (and I suspect a lot of them have). 

Sorry if this comes off as confrontational, but I think that's just how I speak about these things haha. I love you all, and go drink some water :)",6,1754119005.0,aiwars,5,1.0,False

1mfk9g3,https://i.redd.it/rf7mkxvyujgf1.jpeg,"If you’re lost with Amazon PPC or SEO, this helped me (and might help you too)","This post is for anyone who’s unsure what keywords to target in PPC or SEO. Maybe you’re launching a product or you’ve been live for a while but can’t seem to gain traction.   
I’m not selling anything, just sharing what I’ve used for myself and my clients over the last 5 years. 

How reliable is this? All top sellers I know (and myself included) have used this method to launch products for years. It really works.   
  
Main points, why this is so beneficial to use:

* You’ll find high buying intent keywords right away that all your competitors are using
* You can clearly sort which keywords to target first in PPC and SEO, and which ones to leave for later
* You’ll uncover more keywords (including hidden ones) than if you were just looking at one competitor at a time
* It shows which competitors are struggling to rank properly (check the green, yellow, and orange color codes). You find listings you can outrank more easily, and that’s exactly what I use during every product launch. Orange = strong rankings, Yellow = average, Green = weak
* You can also compare your own product to your top competitors and see how you’re doing so far. Higher % = better. 

First understand this: On Amazon the more relevant your keyword targeting is, the better chance you have to rank, get sales and stay profitable.

Eventually you want to:

* Rank organically for as many relevant keywords as possible for positions <30 (this is where most sales happen)
* Run PPC campaigns targeting those same relevant keywords

First, you got to start this research using your main keyword on Amazon.

How to find your main keyword:

1. Find your main competitor
2. Do a reverse ASIN lookup (I use Helium10)
3. Filter by organic rank positions 1–30
4. Sort by search volume (high to low)
5. Look for a keyword where that product is ranked in top 10–20, the keyword is clearly relevant to your product and it has solid search volume

Example: if you're selling ashwagandha coffee for energy and stress relief, then ""coffee"" is too broad and ""ashwagandha coffee for energy and stress"" is probably too specific or low volume but ""ashwagandha coffee"" could be main keyword to use.

That main keyword becomes your base for finding more relevant competitors. Search it on Amazon (if you're outside the US, use a US ZIP code to get accurate results), and then:

* Open Helium10 or whichever tool you use
* Select the top 10 most relevant, top selling listings
* Do a reverse ASIN lookup on them too
* From there, follow the SOP I’ve outlined in this Google Sheet (make a copy to your own Drive): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a\_IGzaLbTQLiPbnn6jqnzbnHe-QAKM2jAp1tBzELhOQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a_IGzaLbTQLiPbnn6jqnzbnHe-QAKM2jAp1tBzELhOQ/edit?usp=sharing) *(to mods: no self promotion)*

Here’s how I structure my PPC campaigns after keyword research:

Start with 5–10 relevant keywords (in the sheet they’re marked light blue)

* Create exact match campaigns (to get indexed)
* One campaign, one ad group, up to 5 keywords
* If a keyword has 5k–10k+ search volume, add them in a single keyword campaign

Next, add product targeting campaigns

* Include up to 5 competitors in one campaign and repeat

After 3–7 days, add broad match and phrase match campaigns (these are great for catching long tail searches while targeting main keywords that convert cheaper)

Then add auto campaigns (i like to create separate campaigns for each targeting group - e.g close match and loose match in their own campaign)

After about 30 days:

* switch campaign bidding from fixed bids to dynamic down only to start lowering ACOS (optional)
* add in the 3–4 relevancy keywords you didn’t use at launch
* make sure to negate irrelevant terms in broad, phrase, auto campaigns
* if you're qualified, run sponsored brands, display ads too
* at launch, keep close eye on your campaigns daily (do not make big changes), after 30 days or so, you can optimize your campaigns weekly.

Don’t forget SEO

Update your listing with the keywords you’re finding through PPC and this keyword research. Add them not just to title or bullets, but backend fields, A+ alt text, brand story etc.

Happy to answer questions if anything was unclear. If it was helpful, let me know by just upvoting the post, i will then know if it's worth doing any similar posts in near future. Cheers.",2,1754118571.0,AmazonFBA,1,1.0,False

I live in Erie, Pennsylvania. You may know us from [John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qjafPzoy4eI), the [Pizza Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Brian_Wells), or [that one movie about that one band that went to Mercyhurst](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117887/). Erie used to be the third largest city in the state, which in practice was like being the 4th best Indiana Jones film or the 3rd longest bridge in California. Nobody cares, but there are enough nobodies out there to make any potential improvements cost millions of dollars. A town small enough to have the whole population interested in a quaint little hobby interest but large enough that engaging in said interest requires zoning permits and dedicated committees in the county government. Add onto this the desperation and penny-pinching coming from the fact that we're now down to the 5th largest city in PA and *really* feeling the classic Rust Belt jitters that created the situation in Flint, Michigan. It's not fun. 

This is a story about our biggest source of pride, all of the charming local weirdness required to keep it afloat, and what the US Coast Guard gets up to when they're not fishing drunk people out of the bay. Oh, and the squabbling. Wouldn't be HobbyDrama without the squabbling

# History of the US Brig *Niagara*

> *""The personal deportment of Captain Perry, throughout the day, was worthy of all praise.""*

>  - James Cooper, ""History of the Navy"" (1839)

If you're only here for the drama, feel free to skip ahead. But as the resident of a midsize town I'm required by law to describe our one claim to fame at length whenever it's brought up. 

During the middle of the War of 1812, there was a need for a Navy on the Great Lakes. British vessels had already captured what ships America had on the lakes at the start of the war, and the free ship travel made it easier for them to supply their land efforts in the rugged backcountry wildernesses of Michigan and Ohio (the area may have civilized since then, but nobody's bothered to check). Erie resident Daniel Dobbins suggested to President James Madison the construction of a new fleet on the lakes, using the shallow Presque Isle Bay as protection for the shipyards. Despite a severe lack of resources (Erie's population at the time was around 400, and construction used up the town's *entire supply of nails*), the fleet was finished by mid 1813, cannons and Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry imported from Rhode Island. 

Amongst an accompaniment of several smaller ships, the British *Detroit* and *Queen Charlotte* squared off with the American *Lawrence* and *Niagara* on September 10th, off of Put-in-Bay (a small set of islands near the western end of the lake). While *Lawrence* led the American line from the front, *Niagara* lagged far behind. The British had concentrated their larger ships in the middle of their line, and once in range proceeded to reduce *Lawrence* to splinters in a 2v1. Commodore Perry fled from the *Lawrence* in a long boat once the last gun became inoperable, taking with him his personal battle flag. Somewhat ironically, said flag encourages you to [not do what Commodore Perry just did](https://www.hpsd.k12.pa.us/archives/clausen/flags/1812/images/E03a.jpg). You may have heard of it, as it's [now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Give_Up_the_Sheep) [fucking](https://shopiycenter.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/0-erie-seawolves-don-t-give-up-the-ship-tshirt.jpg?v=1751453229) [everywhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/xkthow/dont_give_up_the_ship_flag_spotted_in_the_wild/), especially here in Erie. Now while the *Detroit* and *Queen Charlotte* were still afloat, they had taken enough damage to their officer corps and other critical areas to be significantly less effective than when the day began. Enter the Niagara at last: Commodore unharmed, crew fresh, cannons intact, loaded, and ready to go. The British ships actually ended up crashing into each other while the *Niagara* leisurely raked across the *Detroit*'s bow. 

The aftermath of the battle left America with the most ships on the Great Lakes. That is to say the only ships on the Great Lakes, the entire British fleet having surrendered. Perry's fleet limped its way back to Erie, spent the winter dying of small pox anchored at the newly christened Misery Bay, and buried the casualties in a sandy pit nearby that gradually flooded into the also aptly named Graveyard Pond. Multiple ships were sank at the location as the war shifted towards a close and the costs of maintaining twice the number of ships they budgeted for became pointless. [Various visitors](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dRizytTSwIE) have seen those two names on a map and assumed the whole peninsula is haunted, but no. Haunting is for losers. Heroes get *resurrected*. 

# History of the SSV *Niagara*

> *""Finding she could no longer annoy the enemy, I left her in charge of Lieutenant Yarnall, who, I was convinced, from the bravery already displayed by him, would do what would comport with the honour of the flag.""*

> - Commodore Perry, on his decision to leave the *Lawrence*

In the 1900s, the City of Erie faffed about. This long standing tradition of potentially doing something eventually if they ever get around to it continues on today in the form of arguing over which hotel constructions block which views of the bay from which office buildings, but in the 1900s the long-term tourism plan revolved around re-floating the *Niagara* from the bottom of Misery Bay. Ever heard of the [Ship of Theseus?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldoh71uNZmk) Cool, then you know where this is going. Made into a haphazard, crewless ""replica"" (barge) in 1913, *Niagara* was towed around the Great Lakes for a few years, and then sent back to rot up on blocks at the end of State street for 50 years as ownership was passed back and forth from the city to historical societies to the state and back, funding was granted and pulled, and residents mostly just used it as a playground or broke off pieces as souvenirs. Enough effort was finally put in to have her ""presentable"" for the Bicentennial celebration in 1976. Combined with the now-iconic Bicentennial Tower, this remained the only successful investment of city funds into the bayfront for the next 40 years. ""The faffing about would continue"" concisely sums up the rest of this post, but we're here for the details. 

In the 1980s, more local efforts were made to make the *Niagara* not just presentable, but seaworthy. This involved a complete rebuild due to an extreme case of dry rot, but the refurbishment crew insists that there are pieces of the ""true keel"" still incorporated into the structure somewhere. Never mind the fact that ""pieces of the true keel"" had already made their way into coffee tables and restaurant bars across the city by this point. Afloat once more, and also fitted with modern-day safety equipment, it was now time to find a captain. The SSV stands for Sailing School Vessel, a ship used to pass on the knowledge of sailing ships to future generations, so we now turn our attention to the volunteers who came together to do just that. The first players in our drama. 

# The Flagship Niagara League

> *""Those officers and men who were immediately under my observation, evinced the greatest gallantry, and I have no doubt that all others conducted themselves as became American officers and seamen.""*

> - Commodore Perry, in his official report on the battle

The Flagship Niagara League was formed as a non profit alongside the 80s restoration efforts to help raise money and locate expertise for the refurbishment. While the ship is owned by the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission, the League ran the day-to-day operations of the ship starting in 2009. This involved hiring and training crew, giving tours to school groups, and giving demonstrations on how everything works to curious tourists and passers-by. (Side note: It is also required by law that children in medium-sized cities gets every detail of local history surgically implanted into their skulls during said guided tours. The statue of [Strong Vincent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Vincent) is conveniently just around the corner to expedite the process.) Also noteworthy, they started participating the *Niagara* in various events around the region, something they could accomplish by having funding streams outside of official government and therefore not subject to the usual amounts of economic apathy. Said funding streams also included day sails, where you could pay $85 to ride aboard *Niagara* as she took a trip around the bay and learn about how the crew do their thing. As I am currently sitting feet away from my dad's extensive collection of [Horatio Hornblower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKDixETvzp8) and [Alexander Kent](https://firstplacebooks.cdn.bibliopolis.com/pictures/8484.jpg?auto=webp&v=1339617291), *Niagara* day sails encompass a sizable chunk of my family's home movies. 

As part of their expanded participation, the League joined Tall Ships America. Started in 2001, Tall Ships America is a non-profit group that organizes various large sailing vessel events across North America, but especially the US and Canada. Tall Ships festivals were organized through Tall Ships America to come to Erie at regular intervals, featuring the *Niagara* at center stage alongside [a wide variety of other potential vessels](https://tallshipsamerica.org/vessels-programs/). Specifically, I'd like to draw attention to the *Pride of Baltimore II*, another War of 1812 replica from Maryland that many around here consider to be *Niagara*'s sister ship, and the *Nao Trinidad*, a replica of 1400s exploration vessels that comes all the way from Spain. Not part of Tall Ships but frequently making its appearance during these sorts of events is also the [World's Largest Rubber Duck](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yBzn7gmTthk/maxresdefault.jpg). As part of their participation with Tall Ships, the League currently operates the *Letty G. Howard* (one of the last surviving 1800s Atlantic fishing schooners) to help care for her and train her crew on behalf of the South Street Seaport Museum in New York City. 

I'm writing this post because Tall Ships Erie will be happening once again August 21st-24th, and the *Niagara* will not be attending. Or hosting. And it's kind of up in the air whether she's still part of Tall Ships America at all. 

# More Faffing About, the PHMC, and the Coast Guard investigation

> *""Every brace and bowline being soon shot away, she became unmanageable, notwithstanding the great exertions of the sailing master.""*

> - After battle report from the US Schooner *Ariel*, regarding the *Lawrence*

While the Flagship Niagara League was able to handle their own finances regarding the day-to-day operations, the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission was still the owners of the ship. Crucially, that meant that they were the ones in charge of making sure the ship doesn't rot away over time. Again. After 30 years of not doing that, the PHMC yoinked control of the *Niagara* away from the League for the purposes of refitting and refurbishing in 2024. Despite having decades of experience operating the museum next to the *Niagara*, they did not actually employ any sailors at the time. And despite a large crew of seasoned sailors suddenly becoming available, the PHMC was not interested in simply hiring the people already running the ship to continue doing so. Protect Brig Niagara was immediately started as a petition/group to demand transparency and accountability in the refurbishment process. As to how that process is going, the general picture can be gleaned from the [Protect Brig Niagara website](https://protectbrigniagara.org) (although, admittedly, you should consider this source biased)

> On December 12, 2023, The PA Historical and Museum Commission abruptly severed their contractual relationship with the Flagship Niagara League, effective Dec 31, 2023. Seven months later they finally hired a captain. Other than the lone captain, they still have not hired a crew with the skills or knowledge to properly care for the ship. In particular, the new Erie Maritime Museum Site Administrator has no maritime experience at all but is designated as the supervisory authority for all things related to Niagara, her maintenance, and her operation.

> PHMC has made a vague promise that she will sail after extensive maintenance but have not been clear on the plan to achieve those things. After missing several deadlines, while Niagara sat for over ten months, PHMC finally got Niagara to the first of two shipyard haul-outs for work. During that wait she was placed on inactive status with the US Coast Guard and made unavailable, even for public deck tours, and appears likely to remain inactive and entirely unavailable to the public until summer 2026. This behavior of abstract policy and poor communication is consistent with their behavior of the past several years. They have demonstrated a poor track record at making good or timely decisions and have shown a general disregard for skilled people outside of their own ranks.

> This has not inspired confidence among the volunteers and supporters of Niagara.

The first drydock period was conducted in Cleveland, about an hour away by car. During this time the PHMC had hired a crew, and supposedly had opened up applications to anyone interested. Protect Brig Niagara claimed that PHMC had actually hired a contractor to sail the ship over to Cleveland, and that the operation was being investigated by the Coast Guard for mismanagement. These claims have since turned out to be true, as [the Coast Guard found PHMC in violation of the Jones Act.](https://protectbrigniagara.org/phmc-illegally-hires-canadians-to-sail-as-niagaras-crew/) American items moved between American ports must have American ships and American crews, which is why grocery bills in Hawaii are terrible and cruises to Alaska stop in Vancouver. The Niagara is an American ship, and Cleveland and Erie are both American ports, but the contractors PHMC hired were from Canada. If you poke around the website you can find hearsay evidence of other delays, mishaps, and insults being hurled between the League and local PHMC representatives. Again, I can't verify everything said as we're only getting one side of the situation in a lot of cases, but [leaving the ship uncovered during February](https://i0.wp.com/protectbrigniagara.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Niagara-quarter-covered-25.02.05.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1536&ssl=1) was noticed by pretty much everyone who cared to look. 

As of right now, the *Niagara* is in her second drydock phase in Maine. While I personally wouldn't be able to tell if the crew that took her there was Canadian or not, nobody has made any complaints. In fact it's rather interesting that the loudest and longest complainers have said nothing at all about this leg of the process, perhaps no news is good news on that front. The PHMC does occasionally provide [their own general updates,](https://www.facebook.com/eriemaritime98/posts/pfbid0MrRpSSh2dQX39zP5dUtPGVE9vfgpK69m8CYu9NMQ7on9RTDDLfnfEDc2KxTkJuW2l?rdid=FxXqkwTzETAnzC5Z) which don't address any of the complaints but do prove that they're capable of doing things other than run the ticket booth. People on the subreddit (r/Erie) also seem to like the new captain despite the whole Canadian crew thing. And in general, it would appear the people of Erie are content with the progress being made, with the understanding that she eventually return safe, healthy, and open to the public. I'm personally looking forward to going to Tall Ships Erie later this month.

Well, last night I dreamt of a talking cat, and not just any cat - it was wearing a tiny top hat and spaking with a British accent. 🐱

In this dream, I was sittnig in my living room, sipping on a cup of coffee (as usual, I guess) when this cat casually sauntered in, sat across from me, and began discussing the complexities of human emotions. ""Why do humans thnik they're so different?"" it purred, ajdusting its hat with a paw. ""Everyone's chasing happiness, yet they run in circles like a kitten chasing its tail.""

I founnd myself nodidng, oddly comforted by its profound felinne wisdom. Then, just as the confersation was getting deeper, the cat looked me in the eye and said, ""Don’t forget to play, even if you’re busy adulting.""

Woke up this morning still thinking about it. Like, was my subconscious trying to tell me something, or was I just too into those online funny cat videos? Who knows? 🤷‍♀️

Seriously tho, dreams are kinda wild, aren’t they? Do they ever make you question everything or is it just me? Anyway, just thought I’d share this bizarre snippet with someone... hope it gives you a smile today, or at least a pause to ponder. 😊",7,1754118258.0,dearUnknowns,0,1.0,False

Dale, my Dale‘s arm draped casually around Rachel. She was laughing at something he said, her head tilted back, her hair cascading over her shoulders. Dale was smiling too, that easy, charming smile I had fallen in love with.

He pecked her forehead，''See you in your bed tonight.''

I was completely frozen. Tears welled up in my eyes, make a sobbing sound

And they both snapped their heads in my direction.

Dale quickly disentangled himself from her, taking a step towards me. "" Tamara, it's no-,""

I glared at him. ""Really? Because it looks like you two are awfully cozy. And after all the promises, all the things you said about wanting to be a family?""

————————

Just because it’s dark doesn’t mean I can’t see him across the street.

I’d recognize him anywhere. Tall, broad-chested and hunched. Always wearing shorts and walking boots, no matter what the weather.

The incessant rain has finally calmed to a chilly drizzle. The kind that makes you want to pull your curtains across the moment it becomes dark, and get cosy in front of the fire. But right now, I don’t think there’s anywhere I could get cosy. I shiver.

He’s standing in his usual spot. In the shadow of the trees straight opposite my house. Is he trying to conceal himself or does he want me to know he’s watching?

I fight the urge to grab my phone, to call my husband and shriek, he’s back – please hurry home. I’d love for Dale to be at least a little concerned, especially now – for him to be compelled to rush back here, needing to protect me and our unborn child. But I know what he’d say with his usual bored expression… It’s all in your imagination, Tamara. The poor man’s probably just waiting for someone.

Yeah, me. Perhaps Dale will sit up and take notice when my body ends up in a shallow grave. The man stands there every night and it’s always at the same time. He’s never around when I initially arrive home. I get back from the salon at around half past six and Dale’s normally an hour and a half later, after he’s been to his precious gym. The man outside clearly knows our routine.

I glance at my little Fiat which I couldn’t have parked any closer to the house. Each night before I pull in, I do a visual sweep of my garden. And then again before I get out of the car to make sure he isn’t lying in wait to grab me as I dash to my porch. But it’s always the same – he doesn’t appear until I’m safely through the door.

I startle as my phone rings, hoping it’s Dale. Perhaps he’s somehow sensed my distress from his treadmill.

‘Hi, Ali. You OK?’ I can’t keep the disgruntlement from my tone that it isn’t my husband. I should have known better than to hope. He never calls me spontaneously anymore. The days when he used to call just to hear my voice feel like they happened in another lifetime.

‘I could ask you the same question, sis.’ She chuckles. ‘You sound like you’ve just returned from a funeral.’ Despite my disappointment, it’s always a comfort to hear the familiarity of her voice. But I’m surprised that she’s making any sort of joke about funerals – neither of us attended our father’s twelve years ago and three years ago, I attended our mother’s alone. The subject of our parents or any sort of death talk is usually off-limits between us. However, I’ve got other things to worry about right now.

‘The bloody man’s back. He’s been there every night since the new year.’ The heavy curtain falls back into position as I let it drop. I can’t keep looking out into the street. Plus, who knows, my staring back at him might be giving him some sort of encouragement.

‘I thought you were going to report him to the police.’ She sounds as beleaguered as Dale usually does. But just because neither of them has seen him doesn’t mean it’s all in my imagination.

‘I did report him, actually. Last night.’

‘When? You never mentioned it when we spoke.’

‘It was later. Anyway, there was nothing much to mention – it was a complete waste of time.’ I sigh at the memory as I sink into the armchair. ‘He’d vanished by the time they got here.’

‘Didn’t they come straightaway?’

‘No, it took them three hours – that’s how important they thought it was. By then, Dale was moaning he was tired and wanted to go to bed.’

‘Was he with you when they arrived?’

‘Yeah – but he said while we were waiting that they’d probably do me for wasting police time. He reckons it’s my hormones.’

Ali stays quiet, suggesting she probably agrees. What’s got to happen for the two of them to take me seriously?

‘They did look at me as though I might be unhinged.’ I wince at the memory.

‘So what did they say?’

‘Well, I answered their questions. What has he done? What has he said? How do you know it’s you he’s watching? Could he just be waiting for a lift?’

‘You mean, pretty much like I’ve been saying? Especially since you say he’s out there at the same time each night.’ She might be doing her best to disguise it, but Ali’s voice is edged with irritation and something within me sags. If my sister isn’t taking me seriously, what chance do I have of making anyone else listen?

‘They told me they can’t do anything against a man who’s just standing there and instead, gave me a load of waffle about personal and house security. Then Dale made some barbed comment in front of them about getting a life and finding something better to do when I get home than staring through the window.’

A car, which sounds like Dale’s, pulls up outside, so I spring back up from the chair. I’ve been like this a lot lately, and over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been getting worse. I can’t sit still for more than a minute. And it’s not just because of the man outside. My husband’s budding friendship with one of our neighbours is also causing me concern.

‘The police are kind of right, you know.’ My sister’s using the appeasing tone she always seems to reserve for me. ‘If it’s the same man out there every night, he could be there for any number of reasons.’

‘I’d just like to be more important than Dale’s nightly visits to the bloody gym once in a while. He knows the upset this is causing for me.’

‘I’m sure if you asked him, he’d have a night or two at home.’

‘I’ve already tried.’ I pace the rug, resisting the urge to return to my familiar spot at the window. ‘There’s nothing more important than his⁠—.’

There’s a huge shriek and a bang in Ali’s background. ‘Sorry, sis. Gotta go. It sounds like my two monsters might be killing each other. I’ll call you back in a few minutes.’

Feeling lonelier than ever, I rest my phone on the coffee table, then unable to help myself, I return to the window and peel back the curtain, my gaze immediately darting to the spot where the man usually stands. I let a long breath out. He’s gone.

The car I heard was Dale but for some reason, he hasn’t pulled his car up behind mine on the drive. Instead, he’s parked at the edge of the road outside our house.

His headlights fade as he reaches for his work bag from the passenger seat. I don’t want him to see me looking out so I let the curtain drop. His car door bangs and my heart quickens as I wait for the sound of his footsteps to beat their path up the drive to our door.

But the night remains silent.

I peer around the edges of my curtain, hoping he won’t spot me but already knowing what’s likely to be causing his delay.

Yes, just as I suspected, Dale’s talking to that woman across the road. He clearly enjoys her company far more than mine. She steps closer to him, touching his arm, looking to be hanging onto his every word. Now they’re laughing together – he certainly never seems to laugh with me anymore. I know I’ve been miserable since becoming pregnant, not only with the sickness that is thankfully subsiding, but also with the fear that something’s going to go wrong. This really isn’t the time for him to withdraw – not when I need him the most.

The woman throws her head back, obviously loving every moment of their conversation. I can’t believe she’s the first person he wants to speak to upon arriving home after a long day away, instead of coming inside to start his evening with me. I bet he wishes he was going through her front door instead of returning to our side of the street.

And that’s definitely what she wishes.

Until the day I die, I’ll marvel at your perfect face and the way you scrunch your face up when you’re thinking.

I’ll never take you for granted.

The neighbour’s house is lit up like a light show and as always, she hasn’t closed her blinds. She usually doesn’t until much later in the evening – it’s as if she wants everyone to see inside her home, definitely an exhibitionist.

But I’m one to talk – I often nosy into her house from the vantage point of my darkened upstairs window. Naturally, her home is everything mine isn’t. Hers is neutral, minimalist and feminine. In contrast, and just like our childhood home, mine’s a mish-mash of colour and clutter. I’m like my mother was in that respect and no amount of reorganising and decluttering will ever alter that. Dale used to say he liked my style of living and that a house should look ‘lived in.’ However, these days, he moans like crazy about the lack of order in our surroundings. He’ll have even more to complain about when the baby’s born.

What are they talking about? She’s all over him, yet, she barely gives me the time of day whenever I say hello. I’m lucky to get a curt nod as I’m coming and going from the house.

I jump as my phone bursts back into life and snatch it up from the table. I’m so on edge. I rest a protective hand over my still-flat belly. All this stress can’t be any good for the baby.

‘It’s me again. I’ve managed to avert World War Three between the terrors.’ My sister laughs. ‘Anyway, the reason I was ringing in the first place was to check you’re still OK to babysit these little darlings on Saturday. You haven’t forgotten, have you?’

‘Of course not.’ Something brightens inside me. I adore my nephews and love my auntie time. I’ve already got our movie evening and treats planned. The only spanner in the works is that Dale and I will be apart overnight. I’ve suggested so many times that we babysit together but he never wants to.

‘It’s just I know you’ve got a lot on your mind, and⁠—’

‘It’s fine, honestly – you can ask whenever you need to. You know how much I love being around them.’

‘Ah good.’ I can hear the relief in her voice. ‘They can’t wait. You’d think they hadn’t seen you for a month, not just a week.’

‘Anyway…’ Yet again, I peer around the edge of the curtain. ‘He’s gone.’

‘Who’s gone?’

‘The man.’

‘Oh, that man. See, what did I tell you – his lift has probably arrived. But you need to stop looking out of your window all the time, Tamara. You’ll drive yourself bananas.’

‘It’s not just out of this window. He was hanging around near the salon last week and he was even standing two places behind me in the checkout queue at the weekend.’ I’m still unnerved by the memory. I’ve never run to my car so fast with a shopping trolley.

‘For goodness sake, he’s allowed to do his shopping. It’ll just be a coincidence that you’ve seen him near the salon. Otley’s not exactly a vast place in which to live.’

‘It’s the way he looks at me – I’ve got a really bad feeling.’

‘You’ve always had an overactive imagination,’ she chuckles. ‘In fact, you’re far worse now than when we were kids.’

First funerals, now childhood. Like the topic of our parents, the subject of our childhood usually stays dead and buried. However, I have to admit that impending motherhood is drawing bad memories and long-pushed-down feelings of guilt back to the surface. And I don’t have the same energy as I had pre-pregnancy to keep squashing them down. But somehow, I must keep my focus on the present.",1,1754118254.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Ughhh! I'm so tired of this neighbor of mine. He whines about everything. My music is too loud, my cat stares at his house from the back of my couch, and the dog looked at him in a funny way. He complained last week that my dog gave him an ""I'm going to kill and bury you in the backyard"" look, and he said it with a straight face. And he called the cops telling them the same thing. Don't even get me started on what he thinks of my Macaw and pig. You'd think we lived in downtown New York instead of living on the outskirts of Denver. It doesn't matter that I've been extremely nice and have tried befriending him. He's still a class-A jerk.

He walks by with that sad dog look he has perfected and goes through the door into my fenced backyard. We were in the front yard planting flowers along my sidewalk. It's not fenced, but Loki never left my side. He seldom does due to being very overprotective. Apparently, that doesn't register with my neighbor. All he noticed was Loki off-leash, looking his direction and that was enough to scream that he was calling the police. Then he ran for his house. He's such a dramatic little bimbo.

So now I'm back to planting my flowers, waiting for the police to show up again. Not something I'm looking forward to either. I'm not a cop-hater, but I'm not a fan. Growing up in the foster care system doesn't make you fond of the government, caseworkers or cops. There are good ones out there, but they are outnumbered by the bad ones it seems. I have other reasons for distrusting cops, but I work hard at keeping those memories buried deep.

While crouched down patting the dirt around the base of the plant, I hear the unmistakable sound of a Harley. Actually, I hear a few of them. The house next to my annoying neighbor belongs to an older, big, tattooed biker which puts his house across the street and at an angle to mine. He's seldom around and keeps to himself, but I get a shiver every time I hear his Harley coming down the street. Not from fear but excitement. I love that sound. Throaty, deep rumbling with a side of attitude. Once again, I think maybe I should buy one for myself. But I know nothing about them or how to ride one, just that I love the sound.

I look toward the road and see four bikes being followed by a truck. They drive past and pull into my biker neighbor's driveway. The lead bike was a black matte and chrome beast ridden by a huge man with longish black hair, tanned, muscular, tattooed arms and a face the angels must have created themselves. He has shades on, so I didn't get to see his whole face, but what I saw was spectacular. I am close enough to the road to see the small smirk and chin lift aimed in my direction as he rode past. I think I just came a little. It's been too long, way too long, since anyone has caught my attention in that way. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's never happened before. But watching him dismount the bike is like watching biker porn. I can't seem to pull my eyes away from those huge thighs and tight hip. This man is pure muscle, and did I mention huge? Two minutes of watching him, and I have rub club material for the next month.

""I don't need a man. I don't need a man. I don't want a man. I don't want a man,"" I whisper to myself repeatedly as nefarious thoughts enter my head. But even as I'm saying this, I'm still staring at the big biker dude. Then I notice he has taken off his sunglasses and is staring back at me. Wowzer! I didn't think he could get any hotter, but I was so wrong. No idea what color his eyes are, but he is simply gorgeous. I think I'm drooling a bit. But I know it's all fantasy. I'm not a one-night-stand kind of girl, and he's definitely a hit-it and quit-it kind of guy. I'm judging, but it's just in my head so let it be, please.

""Ma'am? Excuse me, Ma'am?""

I look up and see a cop standing above me looking like he may have been there awhile. It kind of startles me a bit, because I'm so careful about staying alert of my surroundings. And he is standing way too close and is obviously looking down my tank top. Gah! What a hip.

I immediately stand up and step back two steps to get him out of my personal space. His eyes start roving, and I'm aware of what he is seeing. Tank top, denim shorts, bare feet, hair in a very messy bun and probably dirt smears everywhere. A normal Saturday for me.

""Can I help you, Officer?"" I ask.

I note that his name tag says Officer Stanaway, and he's of medium build with reddish hair and the ever-present cop mustache. He also takes a step forward and is once again in my personal space.

I resist stepping back this time. Don't ever want to let them think you're intimidated. By them, I mean cops, men, bullies, people in general. A trick I learned in foster care. I make, and keep, eye contact as I ask, ""Can I help you, Officer?""

""We got a call about a dog threatening your neighbor. Are you the owner of the dog?"" he questions.

""I have a dog but he didn't threaten anyone. He was lying in the grass next to me while I planted flowers. My neighbor freaks every time he sees Loki, but he's a great dog and has never even crossed the road. I'm not sure how that's threatening. Have you spoken with Ralph, my neighbor?"" I answer.

""No, I haven't yet. He gave this address when he called in the complaint, I saw you were outside and stopped here first. Where's this dog? And has he ever bit anyone before?"" he asks.

""No, he hasn't and he's in the backyard. I put him there when Ralph starting screaming that he was calling the cops. Look, I don't need or want a problem with the neighbor or you guys, but Ralph is nuts. Talk to him and you'll see I'm not lying. He's straight-up looney toons.""

Just then, I see Ralph coming across the road waving his arms like the lunatic he is. He's panting and sweating like he's just run a marathon as he approaches me and the officer.

As he gets to us, he starts pointing his finger in my face and screaming, ""Her dog is going to kill someone! You have to do something about this Officer! I can't live in fear every day!""

I push his hand away from my face and keep careful watch. Ralph has never laid a hand on me before, but he does seem to be losing it worse today than before. And I don't know him that well since I only moved here a few months ago.

Officer Stanaway steps between us and backs Ralph up five or six steps while telling him to calm down.

Unfortunately, I notice we have an audience with the bikers all standing around watching along with another neighbor from directly next door to me, Mrs. Conner.

Just great! I love the dose of embarrassment that goes along with the irritation of having to deal with Ralph's craziness again.

I tune back into the situation just in time to hear Ralph lose his mess. Screaming, he says, ""She's got the dog from inferno. Big and evil! Her cat is the size of a small pony and gives me the demon eyes all day from her couch. The pig's a farm animal and shouldn't be allowed to skateboard on the same sidewalk humans use and the bird uses foul language every time it sees me! I can't walk down the sidewalk in front of her place without the bird telling me to get away! That's just wrong!"" Arms waving, head bobbing, Ralph looks like the wild animal here.

""Sir, you have to calm down and shut up for a moment here,"" demands Officer Stanaway.

Ralph's arms quit waving, but his bottom lip pops out like a two-year-old. Not a good look on a sixty-ish, chubby, pasty-white face. The man is no looker.

""Ma'am, I will need to see the dog and get your personal information for the complaint,"" the officer says to me.

Then he turns to Ralph and asks if the dog had crossed the road or came onto his property. Ralph replies, ""No he didn't but he was looking at me like he was going to come over and hurt me. I felt threatened because she didn't have a leash on the dog.""

At this point the officer starts explaining to Ralph that there isn't anything he can do since the dog hadn't actually done anything and that I haven't broken any laws, but he will discuss the matter further with me to find a resolution. He then strongly suggested Ralph return home and shut his curtains if the cat was that intimidating.

Ralph leaves, grumbling and complaining.

Officer Stanaway then turns to face me and asks to see Loki. He starts walking towards my front door when I say, ""He's in the backyard. You can see him from the fence on the side of the house.""

""I need to get your personal information and a cold drink would be nice while I'm getting that,"" he smiles.

I continue walking towards the side of the house and toward the fence where Loki is standing, ignoring his comment. He sighs and follows me.

When he arrives, I watch in amusement as his eyes get big at the sight of Loki. My beautiful boy is just standing there staring up at the officer, but I know that he looks intimidating. He's colored similar to a German Shepherd with some gray shades mixed in. He's tall enough that his back's level with my waist and he weighs in the neighborhood of 190 pounds. Very broad and boxy head. Black eyes and a bushy coat. And the personality of a teddy bear, if you're not a threat to me.

""Are you sure he hasn't bit anyone before?"" the officer asks while taking a step back from the fence.

""Nobody I haven't asked him to bite,"" I say smiling a little.

""Let's head back up front and get that information now. Did your neighbor say you also have a bird and a pig?"" he asks as we walk back to the front of the house.

""Yes, I do. I have a dog, cat, a Macaw and a miniature pig that are all licensed and have all their shots,"" I answer. ""And none of them have ever been aggressive toward anyone either. The bird wouldn't say anything to Ralph if he wasn't standing on the sidewalk in front of my house screaming at the cat all the time. Mac is just repeating what he hears.""

I answer the rest of his questions and give the information he needs for his report. Same as I did for the last cop that came here because of Ralph.

""So this phone number you gave me is the best one to reach you at?"" he asks. I nod my head yes.

""So if I call this number and ask to buy you a coffee, you'll answer?"" he says, smiling a little.

I cringe a little inside but answer, ""I'll answer the phone, but the coffee is a no-go. Sorry but I don't date right now. Too busy.""

""You know Ralph is going to continue calling in about your pets and having coffee with a cop just might make the complaints swing in your favor,"" he replies with a creepy-hip look on his face.

Now I'm getting pissed and wanting to unload verbally, but I feel someone coming up behind me at the same time I see Officer Stanaway's eyes go above my head. I don't turn around because I don't care at this point who hears what I'm about to say.

""So what you're saying, Officer Stanaway, is that if I date—""

""What he's saying is illegal and unethical, isn't it Officer Stanaway?"" says a very deep and rumbling voice from right behind me.

Officer Stanaway continues to look above my head as he backs slowly toward his car. With a sneer on his face, he says, ""I didn't realize she was one of yours. She's got the looks but not the plastic, so I obviously assumed she wasn't one of your strippers or club bimbos.""

He turns, walks to his patrol car and while getting in it, says, ""Offer still stands Ava. You decide to aim a little higher, give me a call."" Then he starts the car and slowly pulls away.

I turn around and see the biker I was drooling over earlier standing directly behind me. I look up into that gorgeous face and see a devastating smile. I notice he's taller than I originally thought, at least six foot six inches, maybe more. And broader. Eyes so dark they're almost black. Strong jawline with a day or two of scruff. I would guess early to mid-thirties. And even more stunning, especially with that smile. And yes, you guessed it. I am pretty sure I just came a little again.

I suddenly realize I'm staring, most likely with my mouth open, when he speaks.

""Hey. Sounds like you're having as bad a day as Big Petey is having. None of my business, but when I saw which cop was here, thought I'd step over and keep an eye. I'm Gunner by the way,"" he rumbles.

""Ava. And thank you. He was starting to creep me out,"" I say holding my hand out to him.

He takes my hand in his huge paw and shakes it gently. I still can't seem to stop staring, but his concern is very nice. I've not had many show concern for me.

When I realize I'm still staring and holding onto his hand, I remove mine and ask, ""Big Petey?""

Shaking his head and smiling again he says, ""Yeah. Big Petey's your neighbor and my club brother. He took a minor fall today off his bike and broke his leg. Nothing too serious, but it'll ground him for a while. You don't know Petey?""

""Oh wow. Sorry for him. And no, I don't know him. I see him around but I haven't been here real long. And frankly, he's kind of scary so I haven't ventured over to his house yet,"" I say smiling back. I'm not really scared of him, but he is a big guy. Better to use caution than be sorry later is my belief.

Gunner throws his head back and barks out a laugh, tanned throat moving with the sound. Eyes return to mine and they are full of laughter.

""He's not that big and he's really a pussycat in disguise. You just have to be around him for a while and you'll see he's one of the nicer ones in the club. He plays at being a grumpy old man but it's not real,"" he replies.

""Not many people are going to seem 'that big' to you though,"" I blurt out.

Another bark of laughter and more of those nearly black eyes smiling at me. Suddenly, he reaches a hand toward my face, and I jerk back. His hand stops but stays in the air between us, and his eyes lose the humor.

""You don't have to be afraid because of my size or my being a biker. I haven't ever hit a woman, and you're not going to be the one to change that fact,"" he says quietly.

Then he goes on to say, ""You have a smudge of dirt on your cheek and I was going to brush it away. I should have told you. But now that you know, I'm going to brush it off.""

He gently sweeps his fingers against my cheek and slowly removes his hand. He's looking at me intently, like he has questions to ask.

I avert my eyes. I am embarrassed to have had that reaction in front of him, but I'm ashamed that he thinks it's because of his size and being a biker. And I'm surprised that a hand that big can be so gentle.

I look up to meet his eyes and say, ""I'm sorry. That wasn't because of you in any way. You just caught me off-guard is all.""

He stares back down at me for a moment, and I'm not sure if he believes me or not. The look on his face tells me he's thinking about it, but then he says, ""Want to meet your neighbor now? I was hoping maybe you could keep an eye out for him when one of the club members can't be here. Maybe give him your number to call if he falls or something. You don't have to entertain or babysit him. I'd just feel better if someone this close could just check on him occasionally. He's stubborn and won't want a nurse though. I know it's a lot to ask. You don't know us at all, but it would be much appreciated.""

I think about it for a moment and I know I can't say no to him. His request is reasonable, and he did have my back with the cop. And it wouldn't hurt to have another neighbor on my side when Ralph goes off again.

""Sure. I can do that. I should have introduced myself to him before this anyway. Let me just run in the house and get rid of the dirty hands and I'll come over there. That okay?""

""Perfect and thank you. Don't let Big Petey run you off if he goes into bear mode. Just stand your ground,"" he says.

""Um, okay. That's encouraging. See you in a few minutes,"" I say with a small laugh.

He winks and turns to walk back to Big Petey's. I'm somewhat ashamed to admit I stand watching that very fine backside amble away and even more ashamed when he turns around, walking backwards, and catches me. God!

He grins and says, ""Do you really have a freaking skateboarding pig and a foul-mouthed bird?""

""Well, the pig prefers roller blades and the bird's more of a smartass than foul-mouthed,"" I answer.

He laughs and, shaking his head, turns away and continues to Petey's.

I turn and head indoors to get cleaned up. As I enter the door, I hear Mac. ""Mom, you going to be a jailbird? Jailbird! Jaillllllbirrrrrrrrrddd!"" His voice gets louder with each word.

I laugh as I approach him sitting on his perch near the window. He's a beautiful bright green, red and blue Macaw who's very intelligent and is an attention bimbo. I stroke his head and he purrs like cats do. He's notorious for mimicking sounds and picking up words and phrases alarmingly fast.

""No Mac, I'm not going to be a jailbird. It was just Ralph being Ralph again.""

Mac cocks his head to the side and replies, ""Ralph sucks.""

I laugh and have to agree with him.

On my way to the bathroom, I open the slider and call to Loki. He comes in and flops down on the rug. I head into the bathroom and screech when I see my face in the mirror. O – M – G! I have more than one smudge still left on my face. Also on my neck, arms and shirt. Jeez! What a way to make an impression on the hot biker. Ugh!

I wash up and comb out my hair before pulling it back up and then change into a new t-shirt and jean shorts. I peek into the second bedroom and see Gee and Duffy sleeping. I head to the front door and slip on a pair of flip flops. I start to open the door and then decide I should bring a sweet treat to Petey. Never hurts to show up with cupcakes. I put twelve of them in a bakery box and head back to the front door.

On my way out the door, I say, ""Loki's in charge. Behave Mac. I don't need the cops back here again today.""

I hear a ruff from Loki and a ""No way! Mac's in charge!"" as I close the door behind me.

\-:¦:- Gunner -:¦:-

I keep glancing over at Ava's house waiting to see her headed this way. I hope she hasn't changed her mind. It would be great to have someone this close to Petey to kind of keep an eye on him, but I know it was a lot to ask of a stranger. Especially one who seems to keep her eyes open, head up and watches her environment. There's got to be a reason why she's so careful when most women don't have a clue where they are or what's happening around them until it's too late. She's cautious but doesn't appear fearful. I like that. A lot. And it doesn't hurt that she's stunning. Natural blond hair, big green eyes, lightly tanned with perfect boobs. Never hurts to have perfect boobs, especially when combined with legs that go on forever and a hip that makes me drool. God!

This isn't the first time I've spotted Ava. This is the first time I had a reason to approach her and, thanks to OfficerGodFace, I looked like the good guy. She's right though. He is a creep and our club has had run-ins before with him. But he did give me an in with Ava, so for that reason, I'll cut him some slack today.

The guys are talking about something or another, but I'm not really listening. I'm standing here wondering how I'm going to get a shot at Ava. I don't want an Ol' Lady or a girlfriend. I'm not that guy.

But I want Ava, and I heard her answer to the cop. She doesn't date. Does that mean she's taken, though I didn't see a ring, or does it mean she's not the kind to need a relationship to go along with intercourse? I'm hoping for the latter.

But now I'm wondering if I should've asked her to come over with Vex here. He's the pretty boy in our club, The Devil's Angels. I might be the Prez and have no trouble finding women to get dirty with me, but he's a legend in our club for never getting turned down. But, as I look up, I realize it's too late to send Vex on an errand because Ava is headed our way.

""God! Screw me sideways. She is hot,"" says Fang.

All eyes go in the direction of Ava.

""Shut it, Fang,"" I bark at him.

All eyes turn in my direction. Eyebrows raise with faint smiles on a couple of their mugs.

Ava arrives and is carrying what looks like a bakery box. She doesn't look nervous to be facing five bikers and one prospect. She's just looking at each person for a few seconds each and then moving to the next. I notice her gaze lands on Vex and stays there a bit longer and she smiles slightly before moving on to Petey. I step forward and do the introductions.

""Ava, these ugly men are Chubs, Fang, Petey, Vex and Prospect. This is Ava, Petey's neighbor.""

""Hi guys. I brought cupcakes. Not sure if anyone likes them but...""

Her voice stops abruptly, and she stiffens as Chubs dives towards her and snatches the box out of her hands. Just as quickly, Vex is on his feet and moves in close to her. He holds out his hand as if to shake hers and when she grips his, he grins and places a peck on the back of her hand. Like some freaking Romeo or some mess. He's instantly turning on the charm, and I'm getting annoyed.

She smiles, firmly removes her hand, and turns to Petey. She also takes one step sideways, closer to me. Boom Vex! I realize instantly that she's unsure of everyone but is keeping a good poker face. Also, she may not know any of us but she has already met me, so I'm the safer bet if things are unsafe.

""Hi, Petey. I'm sorry to hear about your accident. It must suck not being able to ride for a while. I'm also sorry it's taken until now to come over and meet you,"" Ava says while smiling. God, her voice is pure silk.

Petey's sitting in a lawn chair with his casted leg propped up, looking irritated. As soon as he realizes she's speaking to him, he sits a little straighter and looks up at her. His face smooths out and I release the breath I didn't realize I was holding. He can be grumpy and being injured hasn't improved his disposition. But having a beautiful woman standing in front of him, and ignoring the rest of us to give him her attention, has helped his attitude.

""That's fine, darlin'. Just glad to finally meet someone who annoys Ralph more than I do,"" he says chuckling. He chuckled! Amazing what a little feminine attention can do to an old sourpuss.

Ava laughs and I reach down and drag the prospect out of his chair and gesture toward it for Ava to have a seat. She sits down and turns slightly toward Big Petey.

""I can't believe he'd give you a hard time. You're twice his size. He must be suicidal along with being certifiably nuts. Can I ask what he complains about with you?"" Ava asks Petey.

""He makes noise complaints about my bike. But he's never said a word directly to me,"" Petey replies.

""So, what you're saying is, that I need to double in size or grow a manhood to get him to back off?"" Ava says.

Petey barks out a laugh and shakes his head. ""No way, darlin'. You stay like you are, and if he gives you any more grief, let me know. I'll have a chat.""

Ava gifts Petey with the sweetest smile. Lucky prick.

Just then, a commotion in the side yard gets everyone's attention. It's nothing serious. Just Chubs running with a cupcake in one hand, the box in the other, his jeans slowly sliding down his hip with Fang and the prospect right behind him. Fang grabs the box just as the jeans win and Chubs face plants. Whooping and hollering commence as Fang jogs toward us.

""I didn't drop a single crumb,"" shouts Chubs while he lies on his back finishing his cupcake.

""Give me that box, Fang,"" demands Petey.

Fang grabs a cupcake and hands over the box. Chubs walks over, licking pink frosting off his fingers, while his other hand is hiking his jeans back up above the equator.

No shame with that man when it comes to food. And I guess I'm right about that when he walks right up to Ava, drops to his knee and says, ""Please Ava. My beautiful Angel. Will you marry me and make me cupcakes until death do us part?""

""You idiot,"" says Fang. ""Those came from Sweet Angel Treats Bakery. You just proposed to a woman, no offense Ava, that knows how and where to shop for cupcakes but may not be able to boil water.""

We all laugh, as does Ava. But Chubs is determined and replies to Fang. ""Don't care. She's smart enough to shop there and that's good enough for me.""

Ava is sitting there laughing at their antics but really makes Chubs' day when she says, ""No, I won't marry you and you shouldn't use that dirty word to someone you just met. But I did bake them myself, and I would be happy to have a taste tester, if you're volunteering, when I try new recipes. I own Sweet Angel Treats and do most of the baking there.""

Chubs suddenly stands up, leans down to Ava's chair and throws both arms around her, pinning her arms to her sides, picks her up and rocks her back and forth playfully.

She lets out a startled laugh as Chubs says, ""Chubs loves Ava. Chubs loves Ava.""

Ava's giggling when she looks down into Chubs face and states, ""You are really into food, huh?""

Chubs sets her down gently and steps back grinning and points to himself with both thumbs saying, ""I didn't get all this awesome stuff eating carrots, honey.""

Chubs isn't a bad looking guy. Not real tall, very stocky, verging on chubby. Curly mop of brown hair, a few days scruff, the personality of a large golden retriever and is very well liked by the club members, family and with the women and hang-arounds. He's a goof and wears it well. He's also a great brother to have in a bad spot because he's loyal.

Petey snort laughs at Chubs but looks up at Ava and points to her chair and says to her, ""Ava, please have a seat and we'll keep that moron off of you. Prospect, get Ava a drink. Beer or a Coke, darlin'?""

Taking her seat again, Ava asks for a diet Coke instead.

I'm hoping she's not into dieting because her curves are heaven made!

The prospect hands Ava a diet Coke and she leans back into the chair and takes a sip.

Even that is a alluring look on her. God, this kind of reaction never happens to me, but I am intrigued with Ava.

""So Fang, how did you know where those cupcakes came from?"" asks Ava, directing her eyes to Fang.

Suddenly, Fang doesn't look so comfortable having the attention on him. Feet shuffling, eyes looking everywhere but at Ava, he mumbles, ""I... uh... I've... um well, I've had some from there before.""

Ava squints her eyes at him a bit and replies, ""Odd. I don't remember seeing you in there before and you would've stood out being a biker in a pink and black girlie-type store.""

Vex looks at Fang and says, ""That chick you were sleeping a while back worked at a bakery. That it?""

Fang looks like he is hoping the ground will swallow him up at that moment, but he shoots Vex a nasty look promising retribution before saying, ""Yeah. She worked there.""

Everyone is suddenly looking at Ava as she has eyes only for Fang now. I can literally see the wheels turning in that beautiful head.

Ava slowly questions, ""Marybelle?""

Fang nods his head once.

""You're the rat prick that screwed over Marybelle!?"" Ava states, not really asking.

Fang nods his head once again.

Suddenly, Ava leans over and snatches the forgotten cupcake out of Fang's hand and gives it to Chubs.

Squinty, scary hip looking eyes pointed to Fang, she hisses, ""No cupcakes for you. No pie, cake, doughnuts. Nothing! You are on Sweet Angel Treats restriction. You cost me my best cake artist. She went home a sobbing mess to her parents and I haven't seen her since! She quit and moved. No notice. Nothing. Left me in a huge bind. Hope that three-way she found you in was worth it. She was a great person!""

""Can I have his share since he's on restriction now?"" asks Chubs through a mouthful of cake and frosting. Honestly, that man has no shame.

Ava stands up and sets down her bottle on the cooler lid. She turns to Petey and says, ""If you don't mind, I'd like to stop over sometimes and check on you. I know you don't want or need someone hovering over you, but I'll worry otherwise. And I'd be happy to bring dinner and hang out if you're up for it. I've enjoyed getting to meet you and the others, well most of the others, and I don't know many in this 'hood yet. But feel free to say no. I don't want to overstep.""

Petey smiles and says, ""Darlin', I would love the company and the home cooked meal. Got nobody that cooks me dinner and that would be great. Bring that dog over though. Would love to meet the beast up close. You're always welcome here."" He pulls his phone out of his shirt pocket and hands it to Ava. ""Put your number in there, honey, and call yourself. I need something, or if you do, we'll have each other's digits.""

Ava does as he asks and hands back his phone with a sweet smile. I quickly hand her my phone as well and after a moment of hesitation she adds her numbers to mine. Whew! She hands my phone back, looks up at me and says, ""Thank you for the help earlier. Much appreciated. And the Coke.""

She turns to the others and tells Chubs, ""Door to the bakery is always open to you. Come by anytime and we'll have a treat and a cup of coffee together. If you have a woman, bring her too. Would love to meet her.""

My big, burly biker brother grins at Ava like she just hung the moon and replies, ""You'll be seeing me, honey.""

She gives a low wave, says goodnight, and heads back across the street. We all watch her until she enters her house and then I turn to Fang.

""So tell us. Who were the other two in the three-way that just got you banned from a bakery? God, brother, I thought she was going to bimbo slap you. That was some funny mess!"" I can't hold in the laughter any longer.

The look on his face was priceless. Not many bikers get a hip chewing from a woman and just take it without saying anything back. He'll never admit it, but I think he was a little scared of her. She was fearless and that, in itself, is another plus in her favor. I'm pretty sure she's going to be a star in my head for a long while to come.",1,1754118193.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I'm really tired of people with no will to live this life and no interest in developing the relationship. All my ""friends"" couldn't care less about me. If I don't text or call - they never will either and that's not just a bullshit yapping of a crybaby complainer. I've tried my best, I lost all the interest and open my heart to new people. (My god that's a bit of a long read happening here lol, I didn't plan it.)

A bit about myself and we're done here:
I have quadrillion hobbies, there's a few that I've been most active with recently: music(I play electric guitar and like to go on underground shows), Volleyball, Mahjong(and boardgames in general. Hit me up if you play some dnd or other tabletop rpg), Videogames(hopefully this hobby soon will stay on far background of my life), travelling and camping, woodworking, electronics, longboarding (and everything else ending on ""boarding""), literature, and my brand new hobbies that I'm getting into are baseball and qigong🫡. A bit of everything here, I know. I'm a diverse, easygoing and nice guy looking to bring some joy back to his life. Cheers.

1mfk2b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mfk2b3/i_die_every_8_days/,I die every 8 days.,"Day One — Rebirth

Eight days.

It’s been eight days since I last died.

That’s new.

I wake up in the middle of Tower 9, the same rusted radio tower where I confronted the machine—the Signal. The cube is silent now, a corpse with no pulse. The air around it hums faintly, like the echo of a storm long passed.

I stumble out into the city, and it's still mine… sort of. Same skyline, same sour coffee from the corner bodega. But people look at me differently. Their eyes linger. Dogs bark when I pass. And when I sleep, I dream of places I’ve never been, of versions of me that never existed here.

I broke the loop.

But I didn’t leave unscarred.

Now… I live.

But only for eight days.


---

Day Two — The Phantom

Dr. Mira Leven is missing.

I knock on 3C.

No answer.

The landlord swears no one’s lived there in years. I try to force my way in—find nothing but dust, broken floorboards, and a shattered picture frame showing a younger Mira with a man I don’t recognize. The man looks like me, but older. Hardened. With one blue eye and one black.

I try to ask questions.

Sanjay doesn’t recognize me anymore.

He sells me smokes with shaking hands. “You look like him,” he mutters.

“Like who?”

He just walks away.


---

Day Three — The Black Signal

The ticking is gone.

Replaced by a hum.

It buzzes beneath my skin, like radio static in my bones. I hear whispers in silent rooms. I see messages burned into foggy mirrors: “YOU AREN’T DONE.”

I try to drown them out. I drink. I scream into the void. But it follows me.

On my apartment wall, I find a phrase written in a language I’ve never seen, scrawled in ash:

ΔV3K Θ: The Black Signal has woken.

I touch it.

The paint blisters my fingertips.


---

Day Four — Echoes

I see her again.

Alyssa.

She’s at a crosswalk across from me. Her hair’s longer, her walk more confident. This version never knew me. She doesn’t see me.

I follow her for hours through the city, hands trembling. I want to say something. Apologize. Thank her. Warn her.

But what would I say?

That her ex-boyfriend is an interdimensional fracture?

That I broke time and now bleed versions of myself into the ether?

No. I let her go.

She boards a train I’ve never seen before. No route. No number. Just a symbol: ∞

And then she’s gone.


---

Day Five — Deathless

I haven’t died yet.

But I’ve started forgetting.

Small things at first. My birthday. My old apartment number. The way my mother smelled like cinnamon and vodka.

I write everything down now.

And still, things slip.

I start seeing faces in reflective surfaces. One grins too long. Another has no eyes. One of them whispers:

“There is no Nathaniel. Only the Signal.”

I punch the mirror.

My reflection doesn't shatter.

It smiles back.


---

Day Six — The One Who Lived

At midnight, a knock.

A man stands at my door. Dressed like me. Scarred like me. One eye black as oil.

He steps inside like he owns the place.

“I’m what happens when you survive past Day Eight,” he says.

“You’ve lived?”

He shrugs. “Not exactly. More like… mutated. You don’t escape the loop. You become it.”

I ask what the Signal is.

He looks through me. “A broadcast from something older than time. A test pattern. We're the static in between. Every version of you is a tuning fork. Every death… a calibration.”

“Calibration for what?”

He grins.

“Reunion.”

Then he vanishes.


---

Day Seven — Split

I wake up somewhere else.

A motel room. Flickering neon sign outside: “ECHO STAY — $25/Night.”

I don't remember getting here.

The woman at the front desk smiles too wide. Her eyes are static.

“Your eighth day is coming, Mr. Drake.”

“How do you know my name?”

“We all know your name.”

The room smells like ozone and burnt hair.

I see my journal on the nightstand. My own handwriting. But not mine.

A single sentence repeated over and over:

“Split the Eighth.”


---

Day Eight — The New Loop

I don’t sleep that night.

I don’t blink.

I just wait.

11:59 PM.

I hold my breath.

Then—

The lights go out.

My ears rupture with pressure. The hum returns—deeper now, resonating like a god’s growl. My body twists inward. My reflection on the TV screen shudders.

I see all of me.

Hundreds. Thousands. Some with burnt skin. Some missing limbs. One made of glass. One who is not human at all.

We are a chorus.

A wave.

A broken signal screaming into a silent universe.

And then—

Nothing.


---

Cycle One — The Other Side

I wake up in a city I don't know.

Everyone wears masks—porcelain, lifeless. No one speaks. Time on the street clocks ticks upward, not down. I walk for hours.

There are no mirrors. No screens. No reflections.

Until I find a window.

And on the other side is me.

Staring.

Smiling.

He holds up a sign:

“Welcome to the Dead Eighth.”


---

Day Two — Unkillable

I throw myself off a building.

Nothing.

I drink bleach.

Laughable.

I step in front of a bullet. The world pauses. The bullet floats mid-air like a paperclip in honey. I move it aside with my hand.

I cannot die anymore.

Not here.

Not in the Dead Eighth.

Time bends around me like light through a cracked lens.

I find a door marked “EXIT.”

But when I open it, I fall into myself.


---

Day Three — Resurrection Protocol

I find her again.

Dr. Mira Leven.

But not the one I knew. She wears robes of static and code. Her eyes pulse like twin galaxies. She calls herself The Architect.

She tells me the truth.

“You were a test subject. One of thousands. But you were the only one who refused to forget. The only one who clung to self.”

I ask why.

She says: “Because you were already broken. The Signal can’t overwrite what’s already fractured.”

She places her palm to my forehead.

“You are no longer a loop.”

“You are a weapon.”


---

Day Four — The Garden

I step into the Garden.

A place between timelines.

Roots made of memory. Leaves of static. The trees whisper names of versions long lost.

One tree is mine.

Its bark is scarred with every death I've endured. Fifty-nine and counting.

At its base is a fruit.

I eat it.

And remember everything.

Every timeline. Every Alyssa. Every scream. Every tick.

And the thing behind it all.

The Watcher.

The Eye That Listens.


---

Day Five — War

The other versions are here.

Nathaniels with burnt skin, robot limbs, no mouths. All of them converged.

We are a multiverse choir—and we are pissed.

“We’re not pawns,” I say.

They agree.

We storm the Tower—not Tower 9, but its echo in the Garden. A twisted monument of steel and bone.

Inside sits the Watcher.

It does not speak.

It does not blink.

It only records.

We unplug it.

Reality shudders.

And in the blink of an eye—


---

Day Six — Reset

I’m back.

Apartment 4C.

Monday.

7:03 AM.

But now… it’s quiet.

No ticking.

No hum.

Just… life.

I eat cereal. Walk outside. Sanjay calls me “Nathan” again.

Alyssa walks past me with groceries.

She sees me.

She smiles.

I smile back.


---

Day Seven — Stillness

I sleep that night.

First real sleep in months.

No dreams. No static. No death.

The loop is broken.

I am whole.


---

Day Eight — The Twist

I wake up.

Alive.

No pain. No rupture. No reset.

But something’s off.

The world is… paused.

A bird mid-flight hangs in the sky.

The rain is frozen mid-air.

I step outside.

And there, in the sky, is a massive shape. Like a planet made of eyes. Turning. Watching.

It says only one thing:

“THE NINTH BEGINS.”

And then—

Darkness. ",3,1754117855.0,stories,1,1.0,False

This is just an idea—if you’re interested, please reach out (girls only, English speakers):

I’m a girl who’s been living in Toronto for 3 years, but I still don’t have many friends, and my English hasn’t improved much either.

I have some followers on Rednote, but honestly, life here has gotten kind of boring and I don’t know what to film anymore. So now I really want to make more friends and find fun things to do in Toronto that don’t cost a lot of money.

I’m looking for someone to do a “$20 challenge” with me—basically, you take me to a place where you think we can have a good time for just $20. It could be hiking, grabbing coffee, anything fun (just no weed). I’d love to meet new people and hear about interesting things and stories.

Another idea: we could swap a recipe from each of our cultures! I really love food and would love to try more dishes from different countries.

I’ll film the whole experience and share it on my social media.

She apologised profusely and offered to clean, and I had other things to do so I gave her the stuff to clean. After she came to the till with the wine, and I had to explain to her due to our licensing hours I unfortunately wouldn’t be able to sell her that wine, she questioned me about it, but eventually left, leaving the wine on till, and I had to use some tissue as a barrier when I put it back on the shelf (I wouldve sanitised it but didn’t have anything available, my store manager doesn’t seems to believe in sanitiser, and we don’t sell any either, else I would’ve taken one off the shelf and written it off for staff use.) 


Of course she didn’t do a very good job cleaning her puke so I had to finish up after her. Finished cleaning at about 7:30 and I felt so icky, I really needed to to wash my hands, but of course that moment some crackhead walks in looking around for things to steal, so I had to stay and watch them 😐 I hadn’t even had my morning coffee yet.

The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.

My body gradually weakens.

Today, my wolf is completely gone, and I have three days left to live.

On the last day before I draw my final breath, I agree to donate my kidney to my sister. Thrilled, my mate swears that he'll make it up to me someday.

My sister is being swamped with insults on the college forum after she was caught plagiarizing my Belladonna thesis.

But I come forward and claim that I'm the one who plagiarized it.

Mom and Dad are pleased, saying I've finally become mature.

At last, I've become the perfect mate and daughter in their eyes.

But why are they crying after my body has turned cold and lifeless?

Chapter 1

When I found out I was going to die, I accepted it with ease.

My mate, Simon Knightley, came to me with a sullen expression and said, ""Zora, Laila has been in poor health since birth. She's an Omega with the weakest healing ability.

""One of her kidneys is failing, and she needs a transplant to survive.""

He pulled out a Mate Bond Breaking Agreement to dissolve our mate bond. After hesitating for a long while, he gritted his teeth and said, ""Your kidney is the best match for Laila. But if you refuse to donate your kidney, you'll have to sign this agreement to break our mate bond.

""Laila doesn't have much time left… And she wants to experience the marking ceremony before she dies. After talking to your parents, they agreed that I should be the one to do it.

""I love you, Zora. We're only doing this to make sure Laila doesn't die with regrets.

""Once she's gone, we'll get back together. Okay?""

I stared at the agreement in Simon's hands. Ever since Laila Thorne's kidney failure, everyone in my family had been expecting me to donate my kidney to her.

But what they didn't know was—I only had one kidney left.

When they found out I refused to donate, they were utterly disappointed. They kept saying how ungrateful I was.

""Zora, your sister's dying. All she needs is your kidney to survive. How can you just stand by and watch her die?""

My parents wouldn't listen to my explanation. Instead, they kicked me out.

""An ingrate like you doesn't deserve to be part of this family. If you won't save Laila, then get out!""

And now, even my mate was forcing me to either donate the kidney or he'd mark Laila instead.

But I was dying anyway. At this point, what difference would it make?

""I agree,"" I said airily.

Stunned, Simon jerked his head up. ""Really? That's amazing! Laila has a chance now!""

He tore the agreement and hurried me to the healing hut.

Mom and Dad also received the news. They arrived soon after, and Mom threw her arms around Laila and wept. ""Laila, you have a chance now! You'll be able to stay with me forever…""

Afraid that I'd change my mind, Dad quickly had the healer bring over the surgical consent form.

Once I signed it, my parents finally relaxed.

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad said. ""You're starting to care for your sister. Don't blame us for being biased, okay? Laila's been through so much—she needs our love.

""But we won't mistreat you either. You'll still get your part of the inheritance.""

I shook my head, swallowing the bitterness in my chest. ""Just give it all to Laila. I won't need it anyway.""

Momentarily stunned, Mom patted me and chided, ""What nonsense are you talking about? Of course, you'll need it!

""Even if your mate is the top warrior in the Lunaris pack and can give you a comfortable life, you can't just disregard your family inheritance.""

Slowly, I slipped into a daze.

Ever since I failed to show up for Dad's kidney transplant surgery five years ago and Laila donated hers instead, my family hadn't been this kind to me.

And it was precisely because she had saved Dad that my parents insisted I owed her and that I had to treat her even better.

From then on, Laila got the best of everything.

She also started targeting me by falsely accusing me, making Mom and Dad resent me even more. Eventually, no matter what I did, it was always wrong.

I used to defend myself. Now, I just stayed quiet.

Then Mom rushed to Laila's side, and Dad and Simon followed close behind.

They all surrounded her, and it was the perfect picture of a loving family.

Only I stood alone in the corner, like an outsider who didn't belong.

Chapter 2

My eyes stung.

Rubbing my eyes roughly, I turned to leave, but Simon stopped me at the door.

""Laila has to stay at the healing hut for treatment, and she won't be able to finish her Werewolf Academy thesis,"" he said. ""Aren't you working on the Belladonna Cure thesis? It's exactly the same as Laila's. Why not let her refer to yours?""

A pang of bitterness hit me. I knew there was more to his words.

Laila's health had always been fragile, so I had always done her Werewolf Academy homework for her. She had even asked me to cheat for her in exams.

She didn't want my grades to surpass hers, yet through plagiarizing my work, she became the top student in the Werewolf Academy.

In truth, she hadn't even started her thesis yet. She was just waiting to copy mine.

Noticing my silence, Mom spoke in a low voice. ""You know how bright Laila is. It's just her health… You're her sister. Help her out, okay?""

I had heard this over and over again for the past five years, and I should've been used to it by now. But every time those words echoed in my ears, my chest tightened.

I forced a smile and nodded. ""Alright. I'll go get it now.""

This was the last time. I wondered if Laila could still graduate smoothly without someone to plagiarize from after I was gone.

""I knew you'd say yes!"" Simon exclaimed. ""So when I left home, I brought your thesis with me.""

He quickly pulled it from his bag and handed it to Laila.

Laila stuck her tongue out at me, a smug smile on her face.

Gently stroking her hair, Simon bent down and whispered something in her ear. She flushed and shot him a glare.

I said nothing and watched their intimate interaction.

If my wolf hadn't been killed by wolfsbane, it would've been howling with rage inside me.

I turned and left the healing hut. Laughter echoed behind me, but no one stopped me this time. Perhaps they hadn't even noticed I had left.

I went back home. As I gazed at the cozy interior, I suddenly made up my mind.

I wanted to clear all my belongings. Since no one seemed to care about me at all, I'd just discard everything about myself. After all, I didn't want my things to be a burden.

I packed everything—including my clothes, daily necessities, my pictures, the gifts I'd bought for my family and Simon—and threw them in the trash outside.

I was completely exhausted, and my breathing grew labored. The wolfsbane had taken hold of my body, and with every movement, a wave of excruciating pain shot through me.

I was really dying.

It took hours before I regained some strength. Just as I got into bed and was about to sleep, Simon barged in.

Flanking a crying Laila, Mom and Dad hurried after him.

""Zora, you promised to give Laila your thesis. How could you collude with others and accuse your sister of plagiarism?"" Simon questioned, his eyes thick with disappointment.

""Zora, I understand that you're upset about me borrowing your thesis."" Laila sobbed. ""But how could you ask your supervisor to publicly criticize me online? I've been swarmed with insults! You're so cruel!""

""Zora, we're family. How could you do this to your sister?"" Mom chimed in disapprovingly.

Turning back to Laila, Mom patted her back gently and cooed, ""Don't cry, sweetheart. You'll hurt yourself. I'll make your sister apologize to you!""

Chapter 3

So it turned out after getting my thesis, Laila flaunted it on the academy's forum.

Unfortunately, my supervisor saw the post.

He had always held high expectations for me, even offering to help revise my thesis before. So the moment Laila uploaded it online, he sensed something was off.

He questioned her about the details, but she couldn't answer a single thing.

The people online immediately realized something was wrong.

How could someone fail to answer questions about their own thesis?

Accusations of plagiarism came flooding in.

""Laila's been so devastated that she fainted from crying several times,"" Simon boomed. ""Zora, you're her sister. How could you do this to her? Apologize to her now!""

Ignoring how pale I looked, he dragged me out of bed and shoved me in front of Laila.

My thoughts wandered. Why had he grown so close to her?

Five years ago, after my family disowned me, I had trudged through a downpour, drenched to the bone.

Then Simon appeared.

The moment I saw him, my wounded wolf stirred with hope. I could feel that he was my predestined mate.

He brought me home, gave me clean clothes, a steaming cup of coffee, and sat beside me as I poured out my heartbreak.

He pitied me, swearing he'd treat me well for the rest of my life.

Back then, he had loathed Laila. He never met her, but he despised anyone who hurt me.

But when had things started to change?

Was it when Laila began hovering around him, acting sweet like a lover? Was it when she clung to him during our dates, or when they started texting each other over the phone for long hours?

My lover had become the knight of the person I resented most.

I thought I could handle the pain, but it still hurt.

Now that I was dying, I could've just let them have whatever they wanted.

""It's my fault for putting you in this mess. I'll clear your name by telling them that I was the one who plagiarized your work,"" I said.

The moment I apologized, they were stunned. They hadn't expected me to be this obedient.

""You've really started to care for your sister,"" Mom said, her gaze turning complicated. ""I'm glad that you two are finally looking out for each other.""

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad chimed in. ""If you keep this up, your mom and I will surely dote on you!""

Guilt flickered in Simon's eyes.

""You're my mate, so I'll surely take care of you,"" he said, trying to comfort me. ""Even if you can't continue your studies at the Werewolf Academy, you can still live comfortably.""

I tried to smile through the pallor.

However, the future Simon spoke of didn't exist for me anymore. At this point, their love and affection were luxuries I could no longer afford.

Laila turned on the camera and began recording.

""This thesis was written by me at home…"" she sobbed. ""I never thought my sister would claim it as her own.""

As she spoke, she turned the camera toward me.

Dad, Mom, and Simon all watched closely, as if afraid I might slip.

Forcing a smile, I said, ""Laila's right. I plagiarized her work and told my supervisor it was mine. I'm sorry.""

Everyone exhaled in relief.

Laila quickly uploaded the video to the academy's forum. Soon, waves of criticism and insults crashed down on me.

Pretending to be noble, she stepped in at the perfect time to defend me. ""Guys, stop it. No matter what, she's my sister. I've already forgiven her.""

While no one else was looking, she turned to me with a cold, victorious glare and hissed, ""You have no right to compete with me. Mom, Dad, and even Simon are all mine. You don't deserve to be loved by any of them.""

Chapter 4

Laila and I were twins, but ever since we were kids, she'd always resented me.

She hated sharing her things with me. So she stole our parents' attention, my toys, my dresses—even though she had the exact same ones.

She wanted anything I laid my eyes on.

Back then, Mom and Dad treated us equally. I had everything Laila had, and they often lectured her for taking my things.

But since what had happened five years ago, they poured all their heart and soul into Laila. They thought I was selfish for not visiting Dad when he was hospitalized.

So whenever we got into an argument after that, they always took Laila's side.

""How could you bully your sister?"" was what they often told me.

After feuding with her for so many years, I was indeed the one who lost. I could no longer be at odds with her anymore.

""Yeah, you won,"" I said softly.

The kidney transplant surgery would take place in two hours, and I was about to die.

Given how deep the wolfsbane was already in my system, my soul would also be shattered by the time the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my body.

What would be left was only my lifeless body.

By then, would Mom, Dad, and Simon weep for me?

Perhaps not. For an eyesore like me to leave, they'd probably be overjoyed. After all, Laila was the apple of their eye.

Before surgery, Mom, Dad, and Simon huddled around Laila, comforting and encouraging her.

""Laila, don't be scared. We'll be waiting for you outside,"" Dad said in a tone so gentle that I'd never heard before. ""The surgery will definitely be successful. You'll become healthy in no time.""

""After your recovery, I'll make you your favorite dishes,"" Mom chimed in lovingly.

Simon suddenly pulled out a dazzling moonstone necklace. ""I bought the necklace you fancied at the auction last time. After the surgery, I'll put it on for you!""

They were all so focused on Laila that none of them remembered that I was also about to undergo surgery.

I thought I was used to being neglected. But as I neared the end of my life, the sight before me still broke my heart.

I couldn't help but blurt my thoughts, ""Would you be sad if I died during surgery?""

Mom and Dad were stunned. As if they only recalled my existence now, diffidence flickered across their faces.

But once Mom heard what I said, she snapped, ""What nonsense are you talking about? It's just a simple kidney transplant surgery. Stop jinxing yourself!""

Dad also shot me a disapproving glance. ""Don't say that! How could you curse yourself like that? Get sufficient rest after the surgery, and you'll recover in no time. After all, you're much stronger than Laila.""

""I'll cook you a seafood feast after the surgery's over. You love seafood, don't you?""

Gazing at me affectionately, Simon held my hand and said, ""Don't worry. I hired the best healer to perform the surgery. You'll definitely be fine. Once it's over, I'll buy whatever you want for you.""

Bile rose in my throat. He bought Laila's favorite necklace in advance, yet when it came to me, he'd only make such empty promises.

I bet he'd be delighted after I was gone. He could finally be with Laila.

My gaze lingered on Mom, Dad, and Simon before I entered the operating room.

When the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my skin, the last shred of healing ability I had was completely destroyed. The wolfsbane gnawed at my bones and tore my soul apart.

I stopped breathing entirely as I reached the end of my life.

The moment before I took my final breath, I wondered if Dad would weep for me if he found out I was the one who donated my kidney to him five years ago, and it was Laila who took the credit. Would he feel bad for me, who was always on the receiving end of Laila's slandering and bullying?

Would Mom and Dad ever regret looking down on me?

It didn't matter. Even if they would, I wouldn't be around to see it.

If there were a next life, I never ever wanted to meet them again.

Hello, I - 25M am living with my bf - 29M for 4 months. Dating 1+ year. He’s been having problems finding a job and it’s very stressful for him. 

However, he stays up all night- till 6am playing games. Then he sleeps till 3-4pm. For me, that means i am just waiting for him to wake up and immediately bombarding him with plans, like going out at the weekend… The problem is, he doesn’t like going out too much. In fact, I don’t see any other hobby of his except gaming, whereas i like physical activity, going out, enjoying coffee, movies, and also gaming. When he spends 10 hours/ day in bed and 7-8 gaming, it’s really frustrating. He is taking care of chores, and says “i can do whatever i want in my free time, it’s my hobby”, i cannot find arguments. 

I cannot seem to explain to him, that spending time together for me doesn’t mean he is inside his room playing games while i am next room. How do I adress him? I tend to be offensive and attack with words like “addict”… etc, which makes the situation even worse.

Also, It’s always me who initiates any plans. I hate it, cause I got used to having active friends around me who would push me into activities. Since we moved to different city, i have been feeling alone. Any tips?",2,1754117009.0,gayrelationships,2,1.0,False

A few months ago, I had that nightmare scenario every dev dreads. My backups failed when I needed them most, and the entire source code for the game vanished into the digital void. It was... not a great week. 😬

After the initial panic (and a truly heroic amount of coffee ☕), I decided the only thing to do was to rebuild it from the ground up—better, smarter, and with a backup system that's probably approaching government-level paranoia now.

A few weeks ago, some of you might have seen the first peek from the rebuild (""HELP"" on the wall). This car screenshot is the next step. As you can tell, the theme of ""things not going well"" for the protagonist continues. 🤷‍♂️

Honestly, this image of a broken-down car in the middle of a foggy nowhere feels like a pretty accurate metaphor for being a solo dev sometimes. You're just trying to get somewhere and the engine gives out. 💀

Anyway, I'm just super happy to have something to show for all the late nights recoding everything from scratch. It's a long road back, but we're moving. Let me know what you think of the atmosphere! Happy to answer any questions about the project or the ""joy"" of catastrophic data loss.

1mfjs1b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfjs1b,My ideas for a late summer-to-fall body mist collection [detailed description],"Hi there, I thought I’d create a summer-to-fall collection out of currently available in-store body mists. I don’t own most of these (only four of twelve) but have smelled them and they are certainly on my wish list. Hope you’ll get a kick out of my list anyway. 

In the first pic I chose eight scents starting from the most summery (top left) to the most fall (bottom right). These are my first choices. And the next image of four is my alternates. 

##My scent preferences

My favorite scent category is botanicals and blooms. I like unisex scents and unisex feminine scents. I would absolutely love Harry Potter style apothecary Halloween decor. But my favorite BBW mist is still Brightest Bloom. My second is Aqua Hour. Am so looking forwards to Sunrise Woods. 

##My vision

I wanted to put together a collection of late summer fragrances where there still hot days and some cooler nights. These fragrances are starting to cool down, but also warm up by the fire and with hot drinks. 

##Caveat

I only have Book Loft, Off the Vine, Into the Night (mini) and Vanilla Romance (mini). The rest are to be determined wish list. 

##Top 8 Choices 

* **Book Loft**: has a slightly cooled down solar neroli with air-dried laundry bergamot notes. This is the fragrance to use after you’ve started to put away your beachy solar scents. 
* **Golden Cherry**: this is your underripe, bright, still slightly firm cherry before it becomes dark and sweet. It’s slightly green fragrance that fades to a slightly deep amber, and rests on a clean background. This is your prematurely picked fruit that also gives a hint of fuller flavors to come. It is not the usual sugary cherry from BBW, but much more unisex. 
* **Off the Vine**: this is a the mossy scent of soil and cut grass after rain. Plus a mandarin citrus note to provide an image of the watery insides of fruit. It doesn’t really smell like tomato to me. Maybe like a fresh, crisp, golden cherry tomato, maybe. Not like pasta sauce. Also very unisex. Has more citrus than you’d think. 
* **In the Stars**: you know, it’s been too long since I smelled this one. But I think it’s like a pink smelling baccarat rouge. Has a fiery, woodsy warmth, like sweet wood. 
* **All Eyes on Her**: this is like a plum fragrance. When you eat a plum, there’s the bitter skin and the watery insides. This is the side of plum that I honestly forget about. What does a plum taste like without the iconic plum skin? It’s a scent like All Eyes on Her. It’s all juice, no skin. Captures the aquatic side of plum. In this way it’s both summery and also a bit shaded like fall, like a ball of skinned plum fruit with some remnants of a darker flavor. 
* **Into the Night**: imagine like making a botanical iced tea from raspberry drink mix sugar crystals, rose petals and violet petals. And then forget that because fragrances are hard to describe. But this is a sweet, dark fragrance that is still the drink mix version of a witch’s love potion, because it lacks those herbs and spices, and is all wrapped in sugar. The bottle is beautiful though. 
* **Vanilla Romance**: someone spilled camphor by a wood burning stove. Can also visualize this fragrance as the ashy remnants of a vanilla pod. It is a memory of vanilla rather than vanilla itself. 
* **Glazed Pumpkin**: forget all those fresh scents. Head into Starbucks and order a (pumpkin?) latte and a buttery croissant. This is a medley of frothy hot drink and steamy buttery something, without going into any specifics. Is it pumpkin? It could be. It could be a number of fall flavored drinks mixed in the air together. Caramel? Mocha? It’s all there. This is a busy Starbucks serving a multitude of different drinks and foods in a bottle. Only chose a mini here as Glazed Pumpkin is not really my typical scent. 

##4 Alternate Choices

* **Milk**: you are ambivalent about vanilla. Sorta want it, sorta don’t. And you like oats. This is for you!
* **Vanilla Ease**: the smoke of Vanilla Romance is not for you. Just the dry down, please. And you’d like a shot of lavender in the beginning. But you also want the lavender to disappear. This is for you. 
* **Rich Espresso**: you don’t go to Starbucks for the buttery flaky croissant lunches. You just want the sound and smell of dark roast coffee beans grinding, in a bottle. This is for you. This coffee does have some hazelnut though. 
* **Immortal**: the fragrances on this list are mostly unisex or unisex feminine. But this one is a bit more unisex leaning masculine. Just a smidge. It’s a dark fruity woodsy scent like all kinds of dark shades of red on black. This fragrance, I’ll have to try again. But it also sprays in an aerosol can so mmmmm. Recommending as I find it to be similar, stronger and longer lasting than Vampire Blood.

1mfjpad,https://i.redd.it/u4858i61xjgf1.png,Heather shows the hipsters how it's done.,"Profile: Dr. Heather Sandra Wigston — Structured Intuition in Sound

Dr. Heather Sandra Wigston is a composer and performer at Fenland University College whose work brings rare clarity and form to the often-chaotic world of electronic and improvised music. Trained in language studies and rooted in social work before entering the academic world, Heather’s approach to musical composition is deeply informed by structure, narrative, and a sensitive awareness of human experience. Since coming under the influence of Professor Jemima Stackridge, Heather has embraced Performance Art as an extension of philosophical expression—channelling emotion, intellect, and spiritual insight into her extended solo performances.

Her performances in intimate venues such as Fahrenheit coffee shop or regional art galleries are anything but casual noodling. Heather’s use of modular synthesizers, loopers, and field recordings is marked by a composer’s instinct for pacing, balance, and long-form structure. Improvisation, in her hands, becomes a tool of disciplined exploration rather than idle play. She crafts works that evolve organically yet with unmistakable teleology—each sonic event contributing to a larger arc of meaning. Her performances may span 30 to 90 minutes, often unfolding in slow, meditative layers that invite deep listening and contemplative reflection.

This considered approach stands in sharp contrast to the growing trend of ""hipster hobbyists"" in electronic music: often self-taught, aesthetically motivated, and lacking the theoretical grounding to shape their output meaningfully. While these hobbyists may delight in the tactile appeal of patch cables and glowing modules, their efforts frequently result in undirected soundscapes—streams of vaguely ambient noise without developmental coherence or communicative intent.

Heather’s philosophy is clear: technology is not the music; it is the instrument of musical thought. Her work demonstrates that improvisation, when placed within a framework of knowledge and expressive purpose, can rival composed music in depth and impact. She remains committed to educating others—through performance, articles, and workshops—on how to move beyond surface-level experimentation toward genuine artistry.

Hazel's POV

I stumbled through my front door, exhaustion weighing on my shoulders like a heavy blanket. My feet ached after standing for eight hours at the bookstore, followed by a three-hour evening class at the community college. All I wanted was a hot shower and my bed.

Instead, I found my parents waiting in the living room, their expressions grim.

""Hazel, we need to talk,"" my father said, his voice unusually stern.

I dropped my bag by the door. ""Can it wait until morning? I'm dead on my feet.""

""No, it can't,"" Mom replied, holding up a cream-colored envelope. ""This arrived today.""

The fancy gold script made my stomach twist before I could even read it. I already knew what it was.

""Jessica's wedding invitation,"" she announced, as if it were a normal thing to discuss. As if Jessica hadn't destroyed my life less than six months ago.

""That backstabbing witch is not my cousin,"" I snapped, anger immediately replacing my exhaustion.

Dad's face reddened. ""Hazel Marie Vance! That's enough of that language.""

""She slept with Ethan in my bed!"" My voice cracked. ""My boyfriend of four years. In my room, Dad.""

Mom sighed dramatically. ""Ethan was at fault since he was your boyfriend. Jessica was just... confused. He manipulated her.""

I laughed bitterly. ""Confused? Is that what we're calling it? She knew exactly what she was doing.""

""This childish feud needs to end,"" Mom continued, ignoring my pain. ""Your aunt is heartbroken that you've been avoiding family gatherings.""

""I'm sorry my trauma is so inconvenient for everyone,"" I muttered.

Dad stood up, towering over me. ""You're going to this wedding, Hazel. That's final.""

""I'm what?"" I stared at him in disbelief.

""You heard me. Your mother wants peace in the family, and you're going to help make that happen.""

""By watching the man I thought I'd marry walk down the aisle with my cousin?"" My eyes stung with tears. ""Do you have any idea how humiliating that would be?""

Mom's lips thinned into a disapproving line. ""It's been six months. You need to move on.""

""I have moved on! Moving on doesn't mean I need to celebrate their relationship!""

""ENOUGH!"" Dad's shout made me flinch. ""This isn't a debate. You're going to be there with a smile on your face, or you can find somewhere else to live.""

The ultimatum hung in the air between us. I turned and fled to my room, tears streaming down my face. I heard my mother call after me, but I slammed my door, muffling her voice.

I collapsed onto my bed, sobs wracking my body. After everything Ethan and Jessica had done, my parents were still taking their side. The betrayal cut deeper than I thought possible.

""They're making you go to the wedding?"" Chloe's eyes widened in outrage as she slid a coffee across the breakroom table to me. ""That's cruel, even for your parents.""

I'd called her the moment I woke up, and she'd immediately rushed to meet me at work during my break. Chloe had been my best friend since kindergarten, and unlike my family, she'd been fiercely loyal after the Ethan-Jessica disaster.

""Dad threatened to kick me out if I don't go."" I stared into my coffee. ""I can't afford my own place yet.""

""Those self-righteous—"" Chloe cut herself off, her expression suddenly changing. ""Wait. When is this wedding again?""

""Next Saturday,"" I mumbled.

A sly grin spread across her face. ""Perfect. The Sterling Masquerade Ball is the same night.""

""The what?""

""Only the most exclusive event of the year,"" Chloe explained, excitement building in her voice. ""My father got invited through business connections. I have two extra tickets.""

""Chloe, I can't—""

""Yes, you can. Tell your parents it's a networking event for your career. Which isn't even a lie—half the city's business elite will be there.""

""They'll never buy it.""

""Leave that to me."" She squeezed my hand. ""No way are you watching Jessica marry your ex. You're coming to a masquerade ball with me instead.""

Three days later, Chloe had somehow convinced not only my parents but her boyfriend Noah to go along with the plan. She'd spun the ball as a crucial networking opportunity, even getting her father to call mine about the ""professional connections"" I could make.

""See? Problem solved,"" she announced triumphantly as we sat in my bedroom. ""You'll stay at my place Friday night, and we'll get ready together Saturday.""

I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. ""Have I told you lately that you're the best friend ever?""

""Not nearly enough,"" she winked. ""Now we just need to find you something spectacular to wear.""

The night of the ball arrived faster than I expected. Standing in Chloe's bedroom, I hardly recognized the woman in the mirror. My long black hair cascaded down my back in loose waves, and the deep red satin dress hugged my curves perfectly.

""The final touch,"" Chloe whispered, handing me an intricate golden mask that covered the upper half of my face.

I placed it over my eyes, securing the ribbon behind my head. The person staring back at me looked mysterious, confident—nothing like the heartbroken girl who'd been crying herself to sleep for months.

""You look incredible,"" Chloe breathed, adjusting her own silver mask. ""If Ethan could see you now, he'd regret everything.""

Noah knocked on the bedroom door. ""Ladies? The car's waiting.""

As we headed toward the door, panic suddenly gripped my chest. What was I doing? I wasn't the kind of girl who went to lavish parties or defied her parents. What if they found out? What if I ran into someone who knew me?

""Wait,"" I whispered, grabbing Chloe's arm. My heart hammered against my ribs. ""I don't think I can do this.""

""What's wrong?"" Chloe turned to me, concern in her eyes.

""I'm not... I'm not brave like you. Maybe I should just stay here."" The thought of facing a ballroom full of strangers made my stomach twist. ""Please, Chloe, let me stay?""

...

Chapter 2 - A Reckless Encounter

Hazel's POV

""No way, Hazel. I didn't spend three hours making you look like a goddess just so you could hide in my apartment."" Chloe grabbed my shoulders firmly. ""Tonight, you're not going to be the responsible, practical Hazel who always follows the rules. Tonight, you're going to live a little.""

I stared at my reflection one more time, hardly recognizing myself behind the golden mask. My bright green eyes shimmered with nervousness, but also something else—anticipation.

""What if someone recognizes me?"" I whispered.

Noah chuckled from the doorway. ""That's the point of a masquerade, Hazel. No one knows who anyone is.""

""Exactly,"" Chloe nodded triumphantly. ""For one night, you can be whoever you want to be. No ex-boyfriend, no backstabbing cousin, no disappointed parents. Just you, having fun for once in your life.""

Her words hit home. When was the last time I'd actually had fun? Before catching Ethan and Jessica together, probably.

""Fine,"" I conceded, taking a deep breath. ""One night of freedom.""

The Sterling Masquerade Ball was nothing like I'd imagined. The grand ballroom glittered with crystal chandeliers, while masked figures in suits and gowns mingled like characters from a fairy tale. Classical music flowed from a live orchestra, and champagne flowed even more freely.

""Wow,"" I breathed, clutching my small clutch nervously. ""This is...""

""Spectacular?"" Chloe supplied, already scanning the room like a general surveying a battlefield. ""And full of eligible bachelors. Come on.""

She dragged me toward the bar, Noah following with an amused smile. After ordering champagne for us, Chloe turned to me with determination in her eyes.

""Drink up,"" she instructed. ""Liquid courage.""

I sipped the bubbly drink, feeling it fizz down my throat. ""I don't think I'm cut out for this, Chl.""

""Nonsense. You just need to relax."" She squeezed my hand. ""Look around. Everyone here is playing a character tonight. Why shouldn't you?""

As the champagne warmed my veins, I felt my anxiety slowly melting. Chloe was right. For once in my life, I could be someone else—someone confident and carefree.

An hour and two champagne flutes later, I was actually enjoying myself. Noah had swept Chloe onto the dance floor, leaving me people-watching from a quiet corner. The masks transformed everyone into mysterious characters from some elaborate play.

""You look far too beautiful to be standing alone.""

The deep voice startled me. I turned to find a tall figure standing beside me, his face partially concealed by a sleek black mask. But what the mask didn't hide took my breath away—full lips curved into a confident smile, a strong jawline, and the most unusual, striking violet-blue eyes I'd ever seen.

""I... thank you,"" I managed, cursing my sudden inability to form coherent sentences.

""Dance with me."" It wasn't a question, but there was something playful in his tone that made my heart race.

Before I could overthink it, I nodded. His hand found the small of my back, sending electricity through my body as he guided me to the dance floor. His touch was firm but gentle, confident without being presumptuous.

""I haven't seen you at one of these events before,"" he said, his voice like velvet as he pulled me closer. ""I would have remembered.""

I smiled behind my mask. ""How could you possibly know? Everyone's wearing masks.""

""Some people are impossible to forget, masked or not."" His eyes—those incredible eyes—roamed my face with undisguised appreciation.

The champagne in my system made me bold. ""Are you always this forward with strangers?""

""Only the exceptionally beautiful ones."" His hand tightened slightly on my waist. ""And only when they look at me the way you're looking at me right now.""

Heat flooded my cheeks. Was I that transparent? Something about this man was magnetic, drawing me in despite my usual caution. Maybe it was the anonymity of the masks, or maybe it was just him.

""And how exactly am I looking at you?"" I challenged.

His lips brushed my ear as he whispered, ""Like you're wondering what it would be like to kiss me.""

My breath caught. The music swelled around us, but all I could focus on was the warmth of his body against mine, the intoxicating scent of his cologne, and those eyes that seemed to see right through my mask and into my soul.

""Maybe I am,"" I admitted, surprising myself with my honesty.

His smile widened, revealing perfect white teeth. Without another word, he took my hand and led me away from the dance floor, through the crowd, and toward a dimly lit hallway.

My heart hammered against my ribs. This wasn't me—I didn't follow strangers into dark corners. And yet, I couldn't make myself stop. For once in my life, I wanted to be reckless.

The moment we were alone, he pressed me gently against the wall, one hand cupping my face while the other rested on my hip. ""Tell me to stop,"" he murmured, his face inches from mine.

""Don't stop,"" I whispered instead.

His lips crashed into mine with a hunger that matched my own. The kiss was nothing like I'd experienced before—demanding yet tender, passionate yet controlled. I melted against him, my hands gripping his shoulders as if I might float away without his anchoring presence.

""God, you're incredible,"" he groaned against my mouth, his hands sliding down to grip my thighs through the silky fabric of my dress.

I gasped as he lifted me slightly, pressing his body more firmly against mine. ""We shouldn't—"" I started, but the protest died as his lips found my neck.

""We absolutely should,"" he countered, his voice rough with desire. ""Unless you want me to stop?""

I knew I should say yes. This was madness—a stranger in a hallway at a masquerade ball. But the heat building between us was undeniable, and for once, I didn't want to be sensible Hazel.

""Don't you dare stop,"" I breathed.

His hands were everywhere then, exploring my body with an expertise that left me gasping. When he slipped under the hem of my dress, I didn't protest. When he pushed aside the thin fabric of my underwear, I only urged him on with breathy moans.

""I need you,"" he growled, his fingers working magic that had me clutching desperately at his shoulders. ""Right now.""

""Yes,"" was all I could manage.

What followed was a blur of sensations—his hands lifting me higher, my legs wrapping around his waist, the sound of his zipper, and then the exquisite feeling of him pushing inside me. The angle was perfect, the pressure divine. Each thrust sent waves of pleasure through my body until I was biting my lip to keep from crying out.

""Let go,"" he commanded softly, his rhythm intensifying. ""I want to hear you.""

I did as he asked, letting the quiet hallway fill with my breathless moans as he drove me toward a shattering climax. He followed moments later, his face buried in my neck as he shuddered against me.

For several heartbeats, we stayed locked together, our ragged breathing the only sound. Reality slowly began to seep back in, and with it came the first flickers of embarrassment. What had I done?

Before I could spiral into regret, he gently set me down, straightening my dress with tender care. ""That was..."" he trailed off, seemingly at a loss for words.

""Unexpected,"" I supplied, smoothing down my hair.

He laughed—a rich, warm sound that eased some of my anxiety. ""Spectacular was the word I was looking for.""

Just as he leaned in to kiss me again, a phone rang. He cursed under his breath, pulling a sleek device from his pocket. His expression changed instantly as he checked the screen.

""I have to take this,"" he said, already stepping back. ""Wait here. I'll be right back.""

Before I could respond, he was striding away, phone pressed to his ear. I leaned against the wall, feeling simultaneously elated and foolish. What had gotten into me? This wasn't who I was.

After ten minutes of waiting, it became clear he wasn't coming back. Humiliation washed over me. Of course he'd left—he'd gotten what he wanted from the naive girl at the masquerade.

I made my way back to the ballroom, scanning the crowd for any sign of him or Chloe. Finding neither, I texted Chloe that I was ready to leave.

""You did WHAT?"" Chloe shrieked as we sat in her living room later that night, Noah having tactfully retreated to the bedroom.

""Keep your voice down,"" I hissed, though we were alone. ""It was stupid, I know.""

""Stupid? It's brilliant!"" She clapped her hands together. ""My little Hazel, having hot masked sex at a fancy ball. I'm so proud!""

I groaned, burying my face in my hands. ""Don't be proud. Be horrified. I don't even know his name.""

""That's the best part,"" Chloe insisted. ""It's like something out of a romance novel. The mysterious stranger with the unusual eyes who rocks your world and disappears into the night.""

Despite my embarrassment, I couldn't help smiling. ""His eyes were incredible. This weird violet-blue color I've never seen before.""

""And how was the sex?"" Chloe leaned forward eagerly. ""Don't skimp on details.""

My cheeks burned, but I couldn't deny the lingering pleasure. ""It was amazing. Like nothing I've ever experienced. He was so... confident. Like he knew exactly what I needed.""

""Well, he clearly knew what he was doing,"" Chloe giggled. ""I knew this ball was exactly what you needed to get over Ethan.""

""I guess you were right,"" I admitted. ""For the first time in months, I didn't think about Ethan once.""

""See? Best therapy ever!"" Chloe raised her wine glass. ""To masked strangers and new beginnings!""

I clinked my glass against hers, feeling lighter than I had in months. Maybe this reckless night was exactly what I'd needed to finally move on.

""So,"" Chloe said casually, ""did you guys at least use protection?""

The glass nearly slipped from my fingers as cold realization washed over me. In the heat of the moment, protection hadn't crossed either of our minds.

""Oh my God,"" I whispered, panic clawing at my throat. ""We didn't.""

...

Chapter 3 - The Doctor's Bombshell and a Family's Embrace

Hazel's POV

""I can't believe you kept this,"" I said, taking the bottle of expensive perfume from Chloe's hands. It was the same scent I'd worn to the masquerade ball two weeks ago.

""Of course I kept it. You smelled amazing that night."" Chloe plopped down on my bed. ""And apparently, Mr. Mystery Man thought so too.""

I groaned, burying my face in my pillow. ""Stop bringing him up.""

""Why? He gave you the best sex of your life!"" Chloe nudged me playfully.

""And possibly an STD,"" I muttered, sitting up. ""My doctor's appointment is in an hour.""

Chloe's teasing smile faded. ""Hey, don't catastrophize. You're probably fine.""

""Probably isn't definitely,"" I countered. ""What kind of responsible person has unprotected sex with a stranger? I've never done anything like that before.""

""The kind who needed to break free after being cheated on by her boyfriend of three years with her own cousin,"" Chloe replied firmly. ""Besides, I'm going with you to the appointment.""

""You don't have to do that.""

""Shut up. I'm going."" She squeezed my hand. ""That's what best friends are for.""

Three weeks after my doctor's visit, I sat in the same sterile room with Chloe beside me, waiting for my test results. My leg bounced nervously as I checked my watch for the fifth time in two minutes.

""Relax,"" Chloe whispered. ""Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.""

Before I could respond, Dr. Evans walked in with a folder in hand and a neutral expression that revealed nothing.

""Hazel,"" she greeted me warmly, taking a seat across from us. ""How are you feeling today?""

""Anxious,"" I admitted. ""Just tell me straight – do I have something?""

Dr. Evans smiled reassuringly. ""Your STD panel came back completely negative. You're perfectly healthy.""

Relief flooded through me. I hadn't realized how tense I'd been until that moment. ""Thank God.""

""However,"" she continued, her tone shifting slightly, ""we did find something else in your bloodwork.""

My stomach dropped. ""What is it?""

""Congratulations, Hazel. You're pregnant.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. The room seemed to tilt sideways as blood rushed from my face.

""That's impossible,"" I whispered, though I knew it wasn't. ""We only... it was just one time.""

""That's all it takes,"" Dr. Evans said gently. ""Based on your hormone levels, I'd estimate you're about five weeks along.""

Chloe grabbed my hand, squeezing it so hard it hurt. ""Are you sure?"" she asked the doctor.

Dr. Evans nodded. ""The blood test is quite accurate. We can do an ultrasound today if you'd like confirmation.""

My mind raced wildly. Pregnant. With a stranger's baby. A man whose name I didn't know. A man with striking violet-blue eyes who had disappeared into the night.

""My parents are going to kill me,"" I choked out, tears welling up. ""I'm only twenty-three. I'm still in college.""

""Breathe, Hazel,"" Dr. Evans instructed calmly. ""You have options, and you have time to consider them all.""

""I can't have a baby,"" I whispered, panic rising in my chest. ""I don't even know who the father is. How am I supposed to tell my parents that?""

Chloe wrapped an arm around me. ""One step at a time, Hazel.""

Dr. Evans spent the next thirty minutes walking me through my options. Termination. Adoption. Keeping the baby. Each possibility made my head spin more than the last.

""Whatever you decide, don't do it alone,"" Dr. Evans advised as our appointment wrapped up. ""Talk to your parents, your friends. Get support.""

I nodded numbly, still in shock as Chloe guided me out of the office.

""Eat something,"" Chloe urged, pushing a plate of fries toward me in the diner where we'd met Noah after my appointment. ""For the baby.""

""The baby,"" I repeated, the words still foreign on my tongue. ""I'm having a baby.""

Noah reached across the table and squeezed my hand. ""We're here for you, Hazel. Whatever you need.""

I looked between them, these two people who had stood by me through everything. ""I don't know what to do.""

""What does your gut tell you?"" Chloe asked softly.

I placed a hand on my still-flat stomach. Despite the fear coursing through me, I couldn't imagine terminating the pregnancy. ""I think... I think I want to keep it.""

Tears spilled down my cheeks as I said the words aloud for the first time. ""But I'm so scared.""

""You'd be crazy not to be,"" Noah said. ""But you're not alone in this.""

A watery laugh escaped me. ""You guys are my rocks, you know that? Will you..."" I hesitated, then pushed forward. ""Will you be the baby's godparents?""

Chloe's eyes widened before she burst into tears and threw her arms around me. ""Yes! A million times yes!""

Noah smiled, his own eyes suspiciously bright. ""We'd be honored.""

For the first time since hearing the news, I felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, we could make this work.

That night, I sat on my parents' couch, hands trembling as I waited for them to join me. Chloe sat beside me, a solid presence of support.

""What's this about, honey?"" my mother asked as she and my father settled across from us. ""You sounded upset on the phone.""

I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, Dad... I have something to tell you.""

The concern in their eyes only made this harder. My father leaned forward. ""Whatever it is, you can tell us.""

""I'm pregnant,"" I blurted out, the words hanging heavy in the suddenly silent room.

My mother's hand flew to her mouth. My father went completely still.

""It happened at that masquerade ball,"" I continued, words tumbling out. ""I was stupid and reckless, and I don't even know his name. I'm so, so sorry to disappoint you both.""

My mother recovered first. ""Oh, Hazel,"" she whispered, her eyes filling with tears.

""How could you be so irresponsible?"" My father's voice was tight with disappointment. ""We raised you better than this.""

Each word was like a knife to my heart. ""I know,"" I whispered, tears streaming down my face. ""I messed up.""

""What are you planning to do?"" my mother asked carefully.

""I want to keep it,"" I said quietly. ""I know it won't be easy, but this baby is part of me, and I already love it.""

My father stood abruptly and walked to the window, his back to us. The silence stretched painfully.

""Dad, please say something,"" I begged.

He turned slowly, and I braced myself for his anger. Instead, I saw his eyes were wet with tears.

""You'll stay here,"" he said firmly. ""We'll convert the office into a nursery.""

""What?"" I gasped.

""You heard me."" He crossed the room and knelt before me, taking my hands in his. ""You're our daughter, Hazel. This isn't how we imagined things would go, but that baby is our grandchild. We're not going to kick you out.""

Fresh tears spilled down my cheeks. ""I thought you'd be so angry.""

""We're disappointed,"" my mother admitted, moving to sit beside me. ""But we love you, and we'll help you through this.""

""You need to finish college,"" my father insisted. ""That's non-negotiable. That baby will need a mother who can provide for it.""

""I will,"" I promised. ""I'll work harder than ever.""

My father pulled me into a fierce hug. ""I know you will, sweetheart. You've always made us proud, even when you make mistakes.""

As my parents embraced me, with Chloe smiling tearfully from the side, I felt the crushing weight of fear begin to lift. With this much love surrounding us, maybe my baby and I would be okay after all.

The months that followed weren't easy. Word spread quickly around campus, and the whispers followed me everywhere. Ethan and Jessica were the worst, spreading cruel rumors about who the father might be.

But for every cruel word, there was a moment of grace. My professors worked with me to ensure I could complete my degree. Chloe and Noah came to every doctor's appointment. My parents transformed their home office into a beautiful nursery painted in soft yellows and greens.

When my son was born on a crisp autumn morning, the first thing everyone noticed was his eyes—an extraordinary violet-blue that immediately took me back to that night at the masquerade ball. I named him Leonardo Arthur Vance—Leo for short—after my grandfather and father.

As I held my perfect baby boy, surrounded by my parents, Chloe, and Noah, I knew that despite the unconventional start, we were going to be okay.

The next three years flew by in a blur of sleepless nights, diaper changes, and college papers written during nap times. My parents were my salvation, watching Leo while I attended classes and worked part-time. Chloe and Noah doted on their godson, spoiling him with love and too many toys.

Despite the challenges, I graduated on time, standing proudly in my cap and gown with three-year-old Leo perched on my hip. As I accepted my diploma, I made a silent promise to my beautiful boy with the striking eyes—he would never lack for anything, not if I had anything to say about it.

...

Chapter 4 - A New Chapter in Haven Harbor

Hazel's POV

The sound of a spoon tapping against a champagne glass cut through the chatter in the small conference room. I turned to see Aiden Dalton, my boss of three years, standing with a proud smile on his face.

""Everyone, please join me in congratulating Hazel Vance on her graduation!""

Applause erupted from my coworkers. My cheeks warmed as they raised their plastic cups of sparkling cider in my direction. The small surprise party they'd organized touched me more than they could know.

""Thank you all so much,"" I said, fighting back tears. ""Working here while finishing my degree hasn't been easy, but your support made it possible.""

Aiden approached me with an envelope. ""We're so proud of you, Hazel. But now that you've got your degree, I have to insist you start looking for opportunities in your field.""

I frowned. ""Are you firing me?""

He laughed. ""Of course not! But you're overqualified for admin work now. You deserve better.""

""But I love it here. The hours work perfectly with Leo's schedule, and everyone's been so understanding when emergencies come up.""

Aiden placed his hand on my shoulder. ""And we've loved having you. But you've worked too hard to settle.""

I nodded, knowing he was right. My business degree with a specialty in marketing operations demanded more than filing paperwork and answering phones. Leo and I deserved better.

As the party wound down, I started clearing paper plates when my phone buzzed. Chloe's name flashed on the screen.

""What's up?"" I asked, cradling the phone against my shoulder.

""Guess who just got off the phone with my dad?""

""Oscar? What did he want?"" I asked, curious. Chloe's father had always been kind to me, especially after Leo was born.

""He wants to know if you're interested in interviewing for an executive assistant position.""

I nearly dropped the stack of plates I was holding. ""At his company?""

""No, better! At Sterling Group in Haven Harbor. Dad plays golf with one of their board members. Their CEO's assistant is retiring, and they need someone exceptional to replace her.""

My mouth went dry. Sterling Group was one of the most prestigious corporations on the East Coast. ""That's... that's way out of my league, Chl.""

""No, it's not! You've basically been running Aiden's office since you started. This is perfect timing with your graduation.""

""But Haven Harbor is three hours away,"" I pointed out. ""I can't uproot Leo like that.""

""Actually..."" Chloe's voice took on that tone she used when she was about to reveal a surprise. ""Noah just got offered a position at Haven Harbor Hospital. Senior PR coordinator.""

I gasped. ""Chloe! That's amazing! Why didn't you tell me?""

""I was waiting for the right moment. And now it's here!"" She paused dramatically. ""I already found us an amazing furnished apartment with three bedrooms. One for you, one for me, and one for little Leo.""

""Us? You want us to live together?""

""Of course! And before you ask, Noah already arranged to transfer his tech job to their Haven Harbor branch. We'll all be together!""

I sank into a chair, overwhelmed. ""This is happening so fast.""

""Sometimes fast is good,"" Chloe said softly. ""Haven Harbor could be a fresh start for all of us. No more running into Ethan and Jessica at the grocery store. No more whispers from people who've known you since kindergarten.""

She was right. Ever since Ethan had cheated on me with my cousin, and even more since I'd returned from that masquerade ball pregnant, my hometown had felt suffocating with judgment.

""When's the interview?"" I asked, my decision already made.

""Tomorrow at ten. Video call with someone named Evelyn Reed.""

My heart raced. ""Tomorrow? That's so soon!""

""Fortune favors the bold, Hazel. This is your moment to shine.""

The next morning, I sat at my kitchen table in my nicest blouse, hands trembling slightly as I waited for the video call to connect. Leo was with my parents, giving me the quiet I needed.

When the screen lit up, I was faced with an elegant older woman with light blonde hair twisted into a neat bun. Her smile was warm, putting me instantly at ease.

""Miss Vance? I'm Evelyn Reed, current executive assistant to Mr. Sterling. Thank you for making time for this interview.""

""Thank you for considering me, Ms. Reed.""

She chuckled. ""Call me Evelyn, please. Now, Oscar Dalton speaks very highly of you, but I'd like to hear about your experience in your own words.""

For the next forty minutes, I detailed my work experience, education, and skills. Evelyn asked pointed questions about my organizational methods, ability to handle pressure, and experience with confidential information.

""The position is demanding,"" she explained. ""Mr. Sterling runs a tight ship and expects excellence. His schedule is packed, and you'll be responsible for managing it flawlessly. There will be late nights and occasional weekend work.""

""I understand,"" I replied, straightening my shoulders. ""I should mention that I have a three-year-old son. His care is my priority, but I'm committed to excellence in my work as well.""

I held my breath, waiting for the polite rejection that often followed this disclosure.

Instead, Evelyn smiled. ""I raised two children while working for Mr. Sterling's father. The company values work-life balance, within reason. As long as the work gets done exceptionally well, there's flexibility for family needs.""

Relief washed over me. ""That's wonderful to hear.""

""Now for the practical details,"" she continued. ""The salary is $85,000 annually with comprehensive benefits, including childcare assistance. You'd start next Monday, spending two weeks training with me before I retire.""

I nearly choked. That was more than double what I currently made.

""That sounds... that would be amazing,"" I managed.

Evelyn studied me through the screen. ""I've interviewed twelve candidates this week, Hazel. You're the only one I've offered the position to. Something tells me you're exactly what Mr. Sterling needs.""

My eyes widened. ""You're offering me the job? Now?""

""I trust my instincts. And Oscar Dalton doesn't recommend people lightly."" Her blue eyes twinkled. ""Will you accept?""

""Yes,"" I said without hesitation. ""Absolutely yes.""

""Excellent. I'll email you the paperwork today. We'll see you Monday at 8 AM sharp.""

After we disconnected, I sat in stunned silence for several minutes before calling Chloe with the news. Her excited screams almost shattered my eardrum.

Telling my parents was harder than I expected. We sat in their living room after dinner, Leo playing with blocks nearby.

""Haven Harbor?"" My mother's voice quavered. ""But that's so far away.""

""It's only three hours, Mom,"" I reminded her gently. ""And the opportunity is incredible.""

My father took my mother's hand. ""We knew this day would come, Serena. Hazel needs to build her own life.""

""But what about Leo?"" she asked, glancing at my son. ""He's so used to being here with us while you work.""

""Chloe found an apartment right near a highly-rated daycare center,"" I explained. ""And the company offers childcare assistance. He'll be well taken care of.""

""Who will watch him when he's sick?"" My mother's eyes filled with tears. ""Who will know that he likes his sandwiches cut into dinosaur shapes?""

I moved to sit beside her, wrapping my arm around her shoulders. ""I'll know, Mom. And I'll teach his caregivers. But this job means I can give him everything he deserves.""

My father cleared his throat. ""Your mother and I are just going to miss you both terribly.""

""I know,"" I whispered, my own eyes welling up. ""We'll miss you too. But we'll visit often, I promise.""

Leo looked up from his blocks, sensing the emotional atmosphere. He toddled over and climbed onto my lap.

""Mama sad?"" he asked, his extraordinary violet-blue eyes—so like his unknown father's—searching my face with concern.

""No, baby. Mama's happy,"" I assured him, kissing his forehead. ""We're going on an adventure soon.""

""Venture!"" he repeated excitedly, making us all laugh through our tears.

My father stood and pulled me into a hug, Leo squished comfortably between us. ""We're so proud of you, sweetheart. You've overcome more in three years than most people face in a lifetime.""

""We just want what's best for you both,"" my mother added, joining our embrace.

In that moment, surrounded by their love, I knew I was making the right choice. Haven Harbor would be a new beginning for Leo and me—a place where we could build our future together, without the weight of the past holding us down.

The week flew by in a flurry of packing, paperwork, and tearful goodbyes. Before I knew it, Sunday afternoon arrived, and Chloe, Noah, Leo, and I stood outside our new apartment building in Haven Harbor.

""Home sweet home!"" Chloe announced, unlocking the door with a flourish.

The apartment was spacious and bright, with large windows overlooking the harbor. True to Chloe's word, it was fully furnished with tasteful, comfortable pieces.

""This is way nicer than you described,"" I gasped, taking in the open-concept living area and gleaming kitchen.

""Only the best for my godson and best friend,"" she replied with a wink. ""Leo, want to see your room?""

My son nodded eagerly, his little hand clasped in Noah's as they followed Chloe down the hallway.

""I painted it blue like the ocean!"" Chloe called over her shoulder. ""And there might be a surprise waiting for him!""

Leo's delighted squeal moments later confirmed her hint. I found them in a charming room with ocean-blue walls and a brand new train table in the corner. Leo was already pushing a wooden engine along the tracks, completely enraptured.

""Chl, this is too much,"" I protested weakly.

She waved away my concern. ""The apartment's a steal—Dad knows the owner. And the train table is from all of us. Leo's birthday is next month anyway.""

I hugged her fiercely. ""I don't deserve you.""

""Yes, you do,"" she replied simply. ""Now go unpack. Your first day at Sterling Group is tomorrow, and you need your beauty sleep!""

Later that night, after Leo was tucked into his new bed and Chloe and Noah had retreated to their room, I unpacked my final box. At the bottom, nestled in tissue paper, was a small wooden jewelry box I'd brought from my parents' house.

I opened it carefully, revealing the contents I hadn't looked at in over three years: a delicate gold mask, a dried rose, and a nearly empty bottle of expensive perfume—mementos from the masquerade ball that had changed my life forever.

I lifted the perfume bottle, removing the stopper to catch its scent—a complex blend of amber, jasmine, and vanilla that immediately transported me back to that magical night. The night I'd felt beautiful and desirable after months of heartbreak. The night I'd fallen into the arms of a stranger with mesmerizing violet-blue eyes—eyes my son now shared.

On an impulse, I dabbed a drop behind each ear. Tomorrow marked the beginning of my new life. A fresh start. A chance to prove myself at Sterling Group.

I placed the perfume bottle on my dresser instead of returning it to the box. Perhaps it was time to stop hiding these memories away. The masquerade ball had given me Leo—the best thing in my life. I wouldn't be ashamed of that night anymore.

As I crawled into bed, the scent of the perfume enveloped me like an embrace from the past. Tomorrow I would walk into Sterling Group wearing it, a silent reminder of my strength and the beautiful life I was building, one challenge at a time.",1,1754116508.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I cannot seem to explain to him, that spending time together for me doesn’t mean he is inside his room playing games while i am next room. How do I adress him? I tend to be offensive and attack with words like “addict”… etc, which makes the situation even worse.

1mfjn9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/directsupport/comments/1mfjn9y/dsps_and_mental_health_knowledge/,DSPs and Mental Health Knowledge,"Hi everyone,

I just joined this sub!! I've been a dsp for 3 years and I love it. I love seeing my clients shine. However, I've noticed some things about staff specifically that I don't quite understand.

I feel like a lot of people get into this field with very little mental health experience. I'm on the neurodivergent spectrum myself and often I find myself imparting basic symptoms and explanations of them to coworkers who act surprised. For example, I shared that caffeine tends to have very little effect on ADHD brains after a few staff were shocked that a client fell asleep right after drinking a 32oz coffee. I wasn't surprised at all. 

That example is of little concern but what bothers me is when a client is ""behavioral"" (I hate that word lol, I prefer challenging but even that's a little dehumanizing) and staff complain about it instead of working with the person empathetically and patiently. I totally understand the emotional labor this job requires but if a client escalating makes a staff just as irate, there's nothing productive or cohesive happening. I have clear, healthy boundaries with clients and hardly ever take something personal, even getting called a b**** multiple times a day, because I've steeled myself enough to not let what a client says or does affect me. Many times, it is an attempt at a power struggle and I refuse to engage in that and be some kind of authority in their life. I'm just their staff, there to help. I've noticed that this approach isn't very common? It seems like many people try to push clients into completing tasks instead of encouraging and that leads to a lot of preventable conflict.

I often hear ""I just don't get why they do [insert uncommon action], it's gross/disrespectful/unsettling"" or things like that and every time I wonder if they've truly tried to find the root cause or if most people are just dealing with ""behaviors"" on a surface level. For example, cleaning! Many, many clients struggle with cleaning either because they lack routine, are physically unable, etc and I've overheard staff from separate companies pass judgement on a client's living space instead of... getting up and helping? Or asking the client what they would be willing to do and what staff can help with.

I'm not sure if this makes sense but ultimately, the amount of people that get into this field who lack insight regarding mental health is odd to me. Is it the pay? That can't be it, it's hardly above minimum wage most places!! I'm lucky to be making what I'm making with what little formal education I have besides company training. 

Has anyone else noticed this? Or am I just pretentious lol",1,1754116337.0,directsupport,1,1.0,False
1mfjlb7,https://i.redd.it/oeteu0rsvjgf1.jpeg,[Showoff Saturday] I made a budget tool,"This is my first side/weekend project that I've actually managed to get off the ground. I've been using a variation of this method for a few years now (starting with a spreadsheet) so it's really been built for myself but it's taken off with the help of friends and family who've seen my financial growth from brokeass to where I am now.

I liked YNAB but i hated entering every transaction and categorizing every $6 swipe for a beer, just to see where I was overspending and burning money away anyway. The motivation fades and the ""plan"" just turns to shit.

With this method, I log in on payday, look at what the required balance I need in my bills account, transfer it and I'm done. I keep a couple hundred for spending, and everything else goes into savings.

There's no charts or graphs or reports. It doesn't care how much you get paid. Instead of you telling it arbirtrary goals, it tells you what you need to put aside. The ""Next Deposit"" will also show a breakdown of exactly how much each bill costs you per paycheck so you can cut back if needed.

I've gotten a heap of feedback already, my weekends right now are devoted to making this the best it can be. I'm working on adding instructional videos at the moment. I have some ideas for premium features in the future, but everything you can use right now will be free forever. If you find it useful or have constructive feedback I'd really appreciate it.

Any existing relevant medical issues None

Current medications Citirizine

35 F Canada, smoker, no alcohol, overweight (BMI 38) Got a rash since February. No one knows why. It started with little red bumps here and there, looked like mosquito bites at first. A month later, a bump became oedema on my forearm. Took prednisone for 3weeks with citirizine twice a day. was gone during my prednisone treatment. Came back as soon as the prednisone ended. Been on citirizine 20mg 3 Times since February. With time the rash got worse. Now it's completely out of control. Started with my arms, then my neck and eyelids, fingers, palm abdomen, chest, legs and now also underneath my feet. Now it becomes giant red bumps, full on oedema sometimes, and it's so out of control that I can't sit on a chair because it'll leave marks then it'll become urticaria. I permanently have a rash somewhere if not everywhere. Can't rest my hands anywhere because it'll do the same. I can't even lay my wrists on a table or something. I always have urticaria on my abdomen or anywhere that my clothes touches, or anywhere that comes in contact with any part of my body (I.e: can't cross my own legs/ arms. I got urticaria on the back of my head, if I turn around and sleep on my side then it'll be on my eyelid. Also As soon as my body temp goes slightly up, it flares up. I started working at a retirement home last week and my upper legs are killing me/burning like crazy. I can't sit down or else I won't be able to stand up again because my urticaria compress my muscles. Will provide pictures in private conversation because I have no idea how to post them here. But I tried swapping detergent/soap multiple times/stopped drinking coffee/ started to write down what I eat/ started to mediate to avoid stress. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT CAUSES THIS. PLEASE HELP I absolutely love my job but I can't stand the pain anymore. I'm 35 and I literally look like my residents when I walk after work. I'm slow, it's painful, I can barely stand up. I have no quality of life and I'm afraid to be seen by people because I look gross. Please no doctors here know what's going on with me, they're all puzzled. Any ideas? Theories? It's not cellulitis/ allergic reaction to food/soap/detergent/medication. It's clearly not responding well to citirizine either.

1mfjjrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1mfjjrv/lose_fat_while_adding_toned_muscle/,Lose fat while adding toned muscle?,"Hiii I’m 21F, 5’5 and about 130 pounds (water weight fluctuates a lot so only a rough number). I’ve lost a lot of fat but also a lot of muscle mass. I’d say I’m overall very thin but without any toning (I have very little muscle mass) that usual layer of fat over my body really shows and makes me look pretty flabby. I’m really wanting to tone my body more but also hopefully lose that last stubborn layer. I want to gain muscle but don’t want to bulk because I don’t want to gain a bunch of weight. My overall question is if it’s possible to gain muscle while losing fat, and if so, how? 

As far as lifestyle, I’m a full time student supporting myself so my biggest issues are around budgeting and time management. I live in a walkable city and it’s very hilly so I average about 2 miles walking daily and a lot of that is uphill/stairs, but I could definitely increase. I don’t have a gym membership because it’s really expensive, but for exercise I go to yoga once a week (my school has a club) and the occasional Pilates class. Obviously consistency is an issue. Because of my schedule I’d really like to get recs for workouts I can do at home. I know someone who made a lot of progress by doing 200 pushups throughout his day in 20 rep sets 10 times, but he was bulking and put on muscle easily. 
As for food, I buy my own groceries and cook for myself. I’ve been relying on shrimp, chicken, eggs, and protein powder (21g per serving) for my protein intake. I also have vegetables every day. I’m not the best cook so it’s pretty typical of an average college student, but I’m open to changing these habits!! Here’s the usual: 
Breakfast: egg on top of toasted sourdough slice + a fruit (usually an apple or banana) + coffee with protein powder mixed in AND/OR lemon water with 1-2 tbsp of chia seeds
Lunch: skip, or small snack (usually chips and salsa), or toasted sourdough with jam, but often a smaller serving of what I eat for dinner
Dinner: usually a meal containing an entire chicken breast seasoned differently to diversify meals and a lot of veggies as a side. Sometimes a starch/carb like bread or potato. 
About once a week I have a cheat meal like pizza. Rarely having sugary drinks or dessert. 

I know it seems like I’m resistant to things that will make a real difference, but I’m actually ok with slow progress because I really struggle with consistency and want things I can introduce into my daily life. Of course, I’m open to hard truths. If I’m way off base here, please tell me! Thanks! ",1,1754115976.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.67,False

Your polestar 3 is really nice, but you clearly aren't used to the blind spot since you didn't use your rear camera.

You slammed the brakes two car lengths up and just sat there. When I stopped to let you know, you got defensive and thought you weren't in the wrong because you were backing in to a space. You challenged me by asking if I wanted to talk to you on the sidewalk, and I said sure.

You didn't walk up to have a conversation, you opened by saying ""why are you so mad?"". Not in a casual tone, an angry tone because you got called out for making a mistake. 

You doubled down by saying you are a special forces veteran. When that didn't phase me, you shamed me for my teeth and walked off.

When I made fun of you for shaming a person's looks, you charged back and shamed me for being a cyclist.
