Think quiet nights on the couch, sharing blankets and lazy kisses, sleepy morning coffee, and small town warmth. Maybe it’s two old friends realizing they’re falling for each other, or strangers who end up stuck together during a snowstorm.

I’m in the mood for something a little bit flirty, a little bit tender, and a lot of emotional connection. Slice of life, romance, or something with a hint of drama. Just give me chemistry, banter, and those late night talks that turn into love. I’m semi-lit and would prefer people twenty-one and up. ",1,1764731223.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False
1pcszli,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipsOver35/comments/1pcszli/need_advice_on_reading_a_situation_at_my_group/,Need advice on reading a situation at my group fitness gym,"I (mid-30s M) was paired with a woman during a partner workout at my group fitness gym today, and I want to know if I’m overthinking everything.

We introduced ourselves at the start (I’ll call her S). Throughout the workout we talked briefly about dumbbells, the exercises, normal stuff. Before the last set, I asked how the workout was going and she told me which exercise she didn’t like. Just small, normal talk.

At the end of class I re-introduced myself, she told me she’s been coming since September, she lives nearby, and she likes that the gym uses weights instead of being all cardio. She also actually encouraged me to continue talking when I accidentally cut myself off because I got self-conscious (“No no, tell me… please go on”). That felt like a positive sign.

After class, she was standing near the exit waiting for space because people store their stuff there. I said “Have a nice evening,” held the door, and walked out. She followed shortly after. Nothing unusual.

Here’s where I might be overthinking:  
When at the exit, I can’t tell if she was just tired and neutral after the workout (totally normal), or if she was actually open to talking more and I missed the moment. I didn’t want to come across as a creep or someone hitting on women at the gym, so I kept it very normal.

The truth is, she seemed polite, comfortable, and even encouraging during the workout. But after class she had a neutral expression, so I couldn’t read if she was interested in more conversation or just zoning out like anyone would after an intense workout.

**My questions:**

1. Am I reading too much into a completely normal interaction?
2. Next time I see her, would it be weird to say something simple like “Hey S, good to see you again,” chat for a minute, and then ask if she’d want to grab a quick coffee after class sometime?
3. For women who do group fitness classes — would that feel creepy or unwelcome if done respectfully?

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Additionally, you may find an increasing popularity of plant-based seafood alternatives, as companies innovate to create products that replicate the flavors and textures of fish and other marine foods, appealing to both vegans and those looking to reduce their environmental impact.

Another noteworthy trend is the incorporation of global flavors and ingredients into plant-based dishes. You might explore exciting culinary offerings inspired by diverse cuisines, such as Indian-inspired lentil dishes, Mexican jackfruit tacos, or Mediterranean falafel wraps. This fusion not only makes plant-based eating more exciting but also showcases how versatile and flavorful these options can be. As this trend continues to grow, you’ll find that plant-based cuisine is becoming a vibrant part of mainstream dining, breaking down barriers and expanding the palate of both vegans and non-vegans alike.

Alex worked at a company for about a month then twisted his ankle and quit his job under the guise of hating it. this man child wouldn’t wear deodorant and didn’t shower. one time after woking super late and I got home I noticed that the trash hadn’t been taken out and the kitchen and living room were a mess. I let it go and continued to clean because I was living here super discounted. about a month goes by and I get sick of it. I bring it up to my roommate “hey since Alex is here everyday and all he does is game and eat. can he at least take out the trash?” then all hell breaks loose. she gets mad and storms out. comes back and writes on the fridge expo board “it’s not that hard to take out the trash, love, the household maid.“ feeling bad since I wasn’t contributing much I start to get home from work and clean like my life depends on it. I clean everyday for 3 months. she’s still mad. I try to cook onions and peppers in a pan and Alex gets within 10 feet of it and almost throws up. I deal with this shit for 4 months. then they move another girl into the apartment. we’re gonna call her Amy. well amy moves in but actually tries to find a job but can’t get one due to lack of experience and being an out of stater. but me and her kick it off immediately which pisses off alicia since they’re best friends. fast forward a few months. I can’t cook in the kitchen anymore because cooking means I need to clean for 2 hours, remove 8 plus bags of trash, then cook then clean again because it’s my mess. then after the “can your boyfriend take out the trash?” question appeared everything was my fault. my problem. about two weeks later im doing some intimate things in my room and Alex just barges in and I barley cover myself. She’s immediately pissed and makes a snarky post on Facebook about me. Well anyway she gets in trouble and doesn’t listen to me about rent and payments. I have two freeloaders on my hands and I’m handling half of expenses. I cant afford all of them, and it may be dickheadish of me but I didn’t pay all of a month of rent because I straight up couldn’t afford it. Let alone the electric bill because they had 27 snakes. Yes you heard that right. 27 fucking snakes. I thought that 3 was a lot. And I was wrong. one night I bought groceries, specifically milk, cream cheese, and tater tots. I don’t remember what I was gonna make but less than 8 hours later it was all gone. I made a note on the expo board about how things aren’t cheap and I had a plan and to please replace it when you could. This of course didn’t go well with alex who had no money. He started to be extra petty, barged into my room, stole the living room remote leaving Amy unable to enjoy the tv, and lies about it. Me being me I buy a new tv because she doesn’t deserve that shit and Amy meets me out in the parking lot and told me. “Alex says if you bring a tv home you can’t use the entertainment stand” in response I used the coffee table that I helped pay for. And I put a child lock pin on the tv so he couldn’t get into it Because fuck this guy. Eventually he told me that he was packing up the kitchen and told me to grab anything I paid for. so, in return I grabbed all the spices, sponges, soap, cleaning products and gear, silverware, plates, bowls, cups, the fucking cookie jar, and small appliances. after my roomate got out of trouble she texted me pissed that I did all of that. But she spent almost a year defending this dude. So tell me. AITAH for taking back what I bought? ",1,1764730809.0,u_Tasty_Cupcake_6710,0,1.0,False

 [15h](https://substack.com/@jwoginrich/note/c-183320290?)

In a few hours a snowstorm will hit this farm. This means one of my favorite mornings of the year is about to happen!

After sunrise I’ll head out and blanket the mare and fill her pole barn with a whole bale. I’ll carry more hay up to the sheep shed, too. The pigs will get a whole nest of hay and breakfast, and the chickens will get their feeders topped off.

Once everyone is sated, I will return to the farmhouse and gear up my hawk and head out into the first flurries of the day to take her hunting. Working up a sweat running through the woods with her. Feeling cold air fill my lungs and my legs still able to carry me across the landscape.

Once she’s done and fed, we will both go back inside. I’ll set her on her perch, and take off my sweater to dry. I’ll get coffee, an epsom salt herbal foot soak, and find a cat for my lap. I will read a whole chapter. I will stretch in a way I was told was “too much”. I take up all the space I want now.

Then I’m making buttermilk pancakes, eating as much as I want, and then retiring to the fireside to read while the world blows wild outside my window.

Taking the day off to rest. Taking the day off to heal. Taking the day off to be grateful I made it through November and managed the mortgage on time, that’s three months I haven’t fallen behind. Incredible. You have no idea how long I have been working towards this. Well, some of you do. Some of you have been reading my story for 2 decades now.

…And tomorrow I will shovel and rake roofs and promote pet portraits and pork, and tomorrow I will figure out how to earn some money and believe a better future for myself is possible.

But today: Snow, books, and warmth.

This was the life I always wanted. Not money. Not a fancy car. Not travel, or kids, or expensive clothes. I wanted a Tuesday morning of wild adventure to be my norm, a life with animals and trees. I want to be cold and tired and covered in hay and sweat and lanolin, just to better enjoy the soft return to stillness and warmth in the home I built for myself, by myself, however humble.

It’s been the work of my life to get to this uneventful weekday morning. And I never, ever, will take it for granted.",1,1764730807.0,coldantlercritics,0,1.0,False

1pcssf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1pcssf0/cant_figure_out_my_type/,Cant figure out my type.,"Im not going to be mentioning the types im confused about and types I suspect myself to be because I want to avoid biases of any kind. I find it difficult to adhere to stereotypes of nearly any type , really and if I look inwards on the functions , some do seem prominent but sometimes theyre contrasting functions so I figured I need a second opinion. Also if it counts for anything , i am 20F. Here are some facts about me : 

1. I enjoy researching on topics especially in biology and psychology. My latest hyperfixation is genetics and usually a hyperfixation doesnt go away for me until I have created some obscure theories about it that I dont think anyone else has come up with , all backed by information. I also enjoy writing , chess , gaming,  self-improvement (most times) , shopping (not excessively) and learning new languages. 

2. I wouldnt say I am awkward in social situations. I just dont have a lot to say , even to close ones. I have been told I am quiet but I personally dont agree.  With unknown people who's frequency I dont match , i just stay quiet and have been told i have a RBF. With unknown people who's frequency i match , i am polite , humorous and sarcastic. With close ones , I am childish and goofy mainly to cover up the fact I am an NPC otherwise. I am usually straightforward and blunt and I speak my mind.

3. I enjoy trying new things and finding the best option out of a range of similar things to make it the permanent option. This could be drinks , study methods , anything. I like trying everything and finding out what works best for me so i can always use it. I hardly ever switch after that. I enjoy finding meaning and intention in everything. 

4. I imagine my future and past in the form of pictures. I would envision my future , complete with a blurry picture of my surroundings , what ill be doing , wearing , etc. and then I would ask myself if this is the future i want. I would tweak whatever didnt fit with my compass . This is usually how i make decisions too. I also recall the past in the form of pictures - i sometimes remember the exact shirt i was wearing , the colour of the sky , etc. in vivid detail. 

5. I am very clumsy in real life. I constantly knock over things while walking , have problems crossing busy roads , forget where I kept things constantly , etc. 

6. When stressed, I really retreat into my head. Everything seems very pointless and i start wondering about the concept of the things around me in a negative way - money,  road signs , the cup of coffee I am drinking from. I ignore daily routines , obsessively plan to get back on track but quickly abandon the plans because it feels ""fake and purposeless"". I find it hard to care about anything or anyone else and become excessively rude , self-centered and self-critical. 

7. I am usually a very optimistic person because I have a talent of finding a way out of most challenging situations. I am someone who appreciates myself and those close to me. I care about the emotions of people close to me quite a lot , but I usually find it hard to express that care. 

8. Im extremely perfectionistic , have to organize everything an exact way and im paranoid about very specific things (for example :  pen caps being open). This has sometimes held me back from finishing my work before deadlines since they wouldnt be perfect enough. 

9. I have one close friend and I have made up a reason to dislike everyone else. I have found this weird about myself - focusing on flaws in people or systems instead of what it has to offer but oftentimes this helps me get the whole gist of anyone or anything from the first impression. I am impatient when it comes to people but very patient with my goals. 

10. I need to research and plan EVERYTHING. If i dont , it makes me worry about every little thing. This is also why i enjoy comminucating with other people with curious , complex minds and the weirder they are , the better. I am a very ambitious person and I hate people who complain without taking active steps to make the situation better. I appreciate other ambitious people who focus on solutions. 

11. I romanticize my future and have a firm belief everything will work out for me , despite things not being the best in the moment. I have long lists , plans and systems that I am dying to try out when I get the freedom and environment to. I have a habit of putting these goals before others , even close ones. I am aware of that , and I am working on it. 

12. I have also noticed that sensors call me dumb but intuitives think im very smart. I am not hating or demeaning any mbti and I am simply stating observations and facts. Im not sure what this could mean (actually I do have an idea) , but if that could account for anything , you should use the information for guessing my mbti. 

13. I like finding my own explanations for everything . Its a habit I have and I have come to love. Something without an explanation is stupid , pointless and useless. 

You may be guessing a particular mbti but here are some things that are unlike that MBTI that I possess : 

I laugh a lot. Like a lot. I try to make jokes and i fail badly. I cry to sad songs and sad movies privately. I am not a cold-hearted robot (i think , although people like to call me one) and I freely say things like ""i love you"" to close ones. I sometimes spend whole days gaming and being totally unproductive. I can be really really loud sometimes when I am alone , which i call being impulsive. I like doing slightly unconventional things to prove I am alive just to be disgusted by that later. I do not get everything right the first try , actually most people are better than me in their first tries. I am a slow learner but once I do learn something , it sticks forever. I sometimes break rules that seem totally pointless to me but I think I do it in a very planned , secret manner. I sometimes focus on other stupid things instead of just doing my work. 

Thats all I have to say. If you have something else to ask , you can ask in the comments. I would appreciate if you have a guess , I am really confused about my mbti. Thanks for taking the time to read. ",1,1764730635.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

1pcsqnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pcsqnw/confusing_body_language_from_married_but/,Confusing Body Language From Married (But ‘Separated’) Gym Friend Need Help Reading This?,"
I’ve been talking to a woman at my gym since August. She’s normally quiet, reserved, not flirty, not the type to hug random guys or make strong eye contact with strangers. But with me she opened up really fast. Within a few interactions she was already telling me about her marriage problems.

That threw me off because I’ve known married people for years who never tell me anything personal. She unloaded everything early on.

What she usually tells me:

* She and her husband don’t talk at home
* They sleep in separate rooms
* They’re basically roommates for their child
* She says she’s moving out soon but the date changes every month
* She says he begs her every day to work things out
* She says she tells him no
* She claims she’s been looking into separation or divorce but hasn’t talked to a lawyer

But even with all that going on, they still go out together. Concerts, bars, mall trips, hookah lounges. When I ask how that works she just laughs and says it’s awkward.

It’s hard for me to tell if she’s trying to come across as single and available or if her home life is really that messy and inconsistent.

She slips sometimes. She told me they don’t talk at all but then started telling me about his car accident. When I asked more questions she stopped and said she forgot she told me they don’t talk, then brushed it off.

That’s why I’m trying to understand the body language side of this. Is she hiding things or trying to look more single around me?

Her behavior toward me makes things even more confusing:

* She hugs me a lot even though she isn’t a hugger with most people
* She asks about my type
* She asked if I hooked up with anyone while traveling
* She seemed a little jealous
* She shows me random women on Instagram and asks if she should follow them back
* She often asks to work out together
* Sometimes she makes plans first
* She’s agreed to coffee or lunch with me multiple times
* After one hangout she posted “Made my day” on Instagram Notes
* Today she told me her husband found my Instagram
* She vents to me about their daily arguments
* She seems comfortable opening up only to me

But today everything felt different. No hug when she arrived and no hug when she left. She just shook my hand. She was venting a lot about her husband and seemed stressed and emotionally drained. It didn’t feel like she was excited to see me. This is the first time her energy has been flat.

My question for people who read body language well:

Is her behavior toward me showing she wants me to escalate physically
or
is she just trying to keep an emotional connection and use me as comfort

I’m not trying to start anything with her. I’m not trying to break up a marriage. I just like the attention and the gym vibe. But the inconsistencies in her home life story combined with her reserved personality and how open she is with me make it hard to read her intentions.

The extra confusion today is that she mentioned her husband found my Instagram he keeps begging her to fix things she says she’s moving out soon and she didn’t hug me at all.

Is she pulling back because she’s scared
Is she overwhelmed
Was she never actually attracted to me in the first place

I’m really just trying to understand the body language not judge her marriage.

What does this kind of behavior usually mean
Have you seen this pattern before

This may be the subreddit I’m most active in (considering I’m not much of a Redditor lol). I’ll be 3 weeks clean tomorrow. The anxiety is eating me up. Why is my caffeine tolerance so low now? Yesterday, I had my morning coffee as usual. But I made the really stupid decision to have pre-workout later before the gym. My anxiety kicked in last night. Today I had my morning coffee but again made another stupid decision and had an afternoon coffee. All evening I’ve been feeling super anxious. I have this ball of anxiety in my stomach. I keep feeling like I’m having chest pains. I keep taking deep breaths to make sure I’m….breathing okay? I’m super hyper-fixated on my heart checking for heart flutters. My journey started with a caffeine/zyn induced panic attack which made me want to quit. Does it get better?? I already went to the ER twice in the last few months. Saw my doctor multiple times. EKG’s. Chest X-Ray. Troponin and other blood work. Blood pressure. Everything was normal. I’m really considering if I should reach out to my doctor again or if maybe I really do need to cut down on caffeine. Ugh. Gonna lay in bed and watch a movie lol to ease my mind.

We introduced ourselves at the start (I’ll call her S). Throughout the workout we talked briefly about dumbbells, the exercises, normal stuff. Before the last set, I asked how the workout was going and she told me which exercise she didn’t like. Just small, normal talk.

At the end of class I re-introduced myself, she told me she’s been coming since September, she lives nearby, and she likes that the gym uses weights instead of being all cardio.

When near the exit, I can’t tell if she was just tired and neutral after the workout (totally normal), or if she was actually open to talking more and I missed the moment. I didn’t want to come across as a creep or someone hitting on women at the gym, so I kept it very normal.

The truth is, she seemed polite, comfortable, and even encouraging during the workout. But after class she had a neutral expression, so I couldn’t read if she was interested in more conversation or just zoning out like anyone would after an intense workout.

I was far from the only person to be virtually introduced to the genre of reggae by the album, which featured his classics “Many Rivers to Cross,” “You Can Get It If You Really Want,” and “I Can See Clearly Now.” He passed away at 81 due to a seizure and subsequent pneumonia.

**Dick Cheney**, George W. Bush’s running mate and one of the most influential vice presidents in U.S. history, passed away at 84 from complications due to pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease. Despite all the flowing and glowing tributes, let’s not forget he was the war hawk who falsely accused Saddam Hussein of having weapons of mass destruction in order to start an unnecessary war that was devasting to American soldiers and everyone else involved. Cheney took the U.S. to new lows in systematizing torture and ranted about the unlimited power of the presidency, which we are now paying dearly for in the form of our current leader.

**Paul Tagliabue** was one of only three NFL commissioners during my lifetime. For 17 years, from 1989 to 2006, he focused on making it the most popular sport in the U.S. and wildly succeeded. Tagliabue had been a basketball player at my alma mater Georgetown before successes like upping the amount of NFL teams to 32, overseeing the construction of 20 stadiums, orchestrating labor peace, and modernizing the NFL business enterprise. He passed away at 84 from heart failure complicated by Parkinson’s.

**Tom Stoppard** co-wrote the screenplay for the 1998 film classic *Shakespeare in Love*, but more importantly left a legendary mark on the theater world, winning five Emmys starting with 1968’s take on *Hamlet* called *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead*. I was lucky enough to see *Arcadia* at The Haymarket Theater in London in March 1995, and when I was a kid in 1980, [my dad directed](https://www.siue.edu/artsandsciences/theater/current-season/past-seasons/season1980.shtml) *Travesties* at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. Stoppard passed away at age 88.

**Burt Meyers** invented many classic, post-war boom plastic toys of the 1960s, including Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots, Lite-Brite, and MouseTrap. He was 99.

**Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay** was a singer with The Grateful Dead in the 1970s, joining the band with her keyboard-playing husband Keith Godchaux. She was 78 and had a long cancer battle, but her voice lives on in countless live recordings and on albums including *Europe ’72*, *Wake of the Flood*, and *Terrapin Station*.

**June Lockhart** was known for her TV star turns in *Lassie* and *Lost in Space*, but what I’ll always remember her for was her role as Tori Spelling’s grandmother in *Beverly Hills, 90210*. As Celia Martin, she died in a hospital in season 8 of my favorite teen soap show. In real life, she passed away at age 100.

**Rodney Rogers** was an absolute beast from 1990 to 1993 and almost single-handedly made the Wake Forest Demon Deacons a threat to other great ACC teams of the era like North Carolina and Duke. Tim Duncan would go to the school right after Rogers left for a successful NBA career and kept Wake Forest among the best in the conference. Rogers passed away at 55 due to complications from being paralyzed from the shoulders down back in 2008 in an ATV crash.

**Michael Ray Richardson** was a star guard with the New York Knicks who had almost as much of a prestigious resume in the category of cocaine abuse. He was given a lifetime ban from the NBA and has passed away at 70 from prostate cancer.

**Lenny Wilkens** was named the coach of the Seattle SuperSonics in 1969, becoming only the second Black coach in NBA history. He would go on to retire with—at the time—the most wins of any coach in the league’s history. He was one of a select few who made the Hall of Fame as both a coach and a player, and passed away at age 88.

**Bob Trumpy** was a former Cincinnati Bengals tight end who has passed away at the age of 80. While he made two Pro Bowls as a player, what I truly remember him for is his broadcast work calling NFL games at NBC alongside Dick Enberg, Bob Costas, and Don Criqui.

**Kenny Easley** was one of the greatest defensive backs in football in the 1980s. He is a Hall of Famer who starred for the Seattle Seahawks but had his career cut short by a serious kidney condition. He passed away at age 66.

**Gilson Lavis** was no Difford or Tilbrook, but he was still the drummer of the excellent ‘80s wave band [Squeeze](https://popculturelunchbox.substack.com/p/great-magazine-reads-squeeze-arent). He played on all their biggest hits, including “Tempted” and “Black Coffee in Bed.” My personal faves are “Up the Junction” and “Pulling Mussels (From the Shell).” I finally got to see Squeeze for the first time when they opened for Hall and Oates, although Lavis had long ago, in 1991, stopped being a band member. He passed away at 74.

1pcseoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1pcseoq/which_under_desk_elliptical_fits_in_small/,Which under desk elliptical fits in small apartments?,"Looking for an under desk elliptical that won't take over your tiny apartment? You're not alone. A lot of people want to stay active while working from home, but space is always the big problem.

The good news is that compact models exist specifically for small living spaces. The trick is knowing what to look for before buying one.

## What Makes an Under Desk Elliptical Apartment-Friendly?

Size matters when you're dealing with limited square footage. The best options measure around 20-25 inches in length and 17-20 inches in width. Anything bigger might not fit comfortably under your desk or in your closet when you're done using it.

Weight is another factor. Lighter models (around 20-30 pounds) are easier to move around and tuck away. You don't want something so heavy that it becomes permanent furniture in your already cramped space.

## Key Features to Consider

**Low Profile Design** - Look for machines that sit low to the ground. Your knees shouldn't bump into your desk while pedaling. Models under 10 inches in height usually work well with standard desks.

**Quiet Operation** - Thin walls mean noisy equipment isn't ideal. Magnetic resistance systems run quieter than mechanical ones, which matters when you have neighbors close by.

**Portability** - Built-in handles or lightweight frames make storage simple. You want something you can grab and move without throwing out your back.

## The Compact Solution

Mini elliptical machines designed for desk use typically fit the bill perfectly. They give you a solid workout without requiring a dedicated exercise room. You can pedal while answering emails, watching TV, or reading.

The space-saving design means you can slide it under your couch, bed, or in a closet when guests come over. No one needs to know your living room doubles as a gym.

If you want to see some top-rated options that actually fit in small spaces, [check out these compact models](https://athomewave.com/under-desk-elliptical) that people are using in apartments right now.

## Storage Tips

Even the smallest under desk elliptical needs a home. Keep it under your coffee table or next to your couch so it's always within reach. When you can see it, you're more likely to use it.

Some people keep theirs permanently under their desk if they work from home full-time. Others prefer to bring it out only during work hours and store it afterward.

## Worth the Investment?

For apartment dwellers, a compact pedal exerciser beats a bulky treadmill or exercise bike any day. You get similar benefits without sacrificing half your living room.

The average person burns 150-200 calories per hour using one of these machines at a moderate pace. That adds up when you're sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day anyway.

Ready to find one that fits your space? [Browse apartment-friendly options here](https://athomewave.com/under-desk-elliptical) and start moving more without moving out.

1pcsecp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pcsecp/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_was_trauma/,AITA for telling my girlfriend she was “trauma dumping” after I hit my emotional limit?,"I (29M) have been with my girlfriend (27F) for a little over three years. We don’t live together. Our relationship is genuinely great most of the time, like 95% of the time I love being with her and we’re solid.

The other 5% is when she falls into depressive spirals. During those times she gets extremely pessimistic, shuts down any advice (even when she asks for it), and falls into worst-case-scenario thinking. She also refuses therapy. I’ve brought it up gently, explained that some of our friends have benefited from it, and tried to show her it’s not about “something being wrong with her,” but she is completely closed off to the idea.

Most of her stress right now comes from her job. She originally didn’t like it because she wasn’t doing enough work, but once she did get work she realized she just genuinely dislikes the job entirely. So lately our usual lunchtime calls (we talk because I WFH and she eats in her car) have turned into her venting about how miserable she is, how she wants to quit, how she wants to leave mid-day, etc. Sometimes she “jokes” about walking out and never returning, but the jokes have become so frequent they don’t feel like jokes anymore.

I try my best to listen because I care about her, but it’s been emotionally draining.

Recently, I referred her for a job at my company. She actually got a recruiter phone screening. Instead of being excited, she immediately spiraled into:
	•	it’s just a courtesy call
	•	she’ll never get an opportunity like this
	•	she’d be stupid for trying
	•	it will make her more anxious
	•	she should cancel the whole thing

I tried to help her see it might not be worst-case. But she kept shutting every positive or neutral possibility down.

This is a pattern. Sometimes she goes into “what’s the point of trying” spirals about her whole life: she says she’s already “so far behind,” that her degree is useless because she’s not using it, and she compares herself to everyone in her friend group. I always tell her degrees don’t define your job path and everyone moves at their own pace, but I never feel like I can convince her of anything once she’s in that headspace.

Anyway, during this phone screening meltdown, I finally hit my emotional limit. After she repeated several times that she wanted to cancel it, I said, “If you want to cancel it then just cancel it.” And then, out of frustration, I added that I felt overwhelmed because it felt like she was trauma-dumping on me.

She immediately said, “I’m sorry that I’m depressed,” and hung up.

I knew instantly I used the wrong word. I texted her a half hour later apologizing, saying “trauma dumping” wasn’t fair, but that I did genuinely hit my limit with how heavy everything felt that day. I also told her I want to support her, but I can’t be the only person she leans on emotionally, especially since she refuses therapy and doesn’t open up to anyone else. It gets overwhelming and I don’t always know how to help. I try and understand that she isn’t always looking for help and is sometimes just looking for someone to listen, but I think I just hit my limit and it frustrates me a little when she vents so often, but doesn’t seem capable of making a change. I truly think this stems from her depression.

Since then, she’s barely responded. She texted me last night when I tried calling that she wasn’t in the mood to talk that night, and she ignored all my texts the next day. Now it’s been about a day and a half with no communication, and I don’t know what to do.

I care about her more than anything, but I feel like I’m drowning emotionally when I’m her only outlet for her depression, anxiety, job misery, and self-comparisons especially when she rejects any other form of support.



TL;DR:
My girlfriend frequently unloads her anxieties, pessimism, and self-doubt onto me; things like believing she’s “too stupid” for opportunities, assuming interviews are courtesy calls, spiraling about being behind in life, comparing herself to friends, and saying there’s no point in trying. I care about her a lot, but it’s become emotionally draining because I never know how to help and it’s starting to affect me. She refuses therapy because she doesn’t want to be told “something is wrong,” and I feel stuck between wanting to support her and needing healthier emotional boundaries.

Note:
I used ChatGPT to help me organize and clearly word my thoughts for this post.



Edit 1 (Her response):
She said she feels like when she’s going through something hard, I shut her down before she can fully express herself — whether by cutting her off mid-sentence, trying to fix things she doesn’t want fixed, or telling her I can’t take more. She said it feels premature, disrespectful, and like I’m not putting myself in her shoes. From her perspective, if I had a bad day and opened up, I wouldn’t want her to tell me it was “too much” or to go talk to someone else.

She also said that when I called it “trauma dumping,” it really hurt because she hasn’t been “just complaining.” She’s been feeling extremely depressed, stuck, and completely dissociated — barely able to get out of bed, exhausted, relying on multiple coffees just to function, and constantly angry at herself during the workday. She said she opened up because she needed support from the person she trusts most, and hearing me shut it down made her feel even more trapped and alone.

She added that she doesn’t have many friends to talk to — really just one — so when I suggest talking to other people, it feels like I’m highlighting something painful she already knows. She said it makes her feel like she can’t rely on me emotionally, and that she now feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me, which scares her. She said she needs to know whether I’m actually able to be the kind of partner she can rely on during serious times.",3,1764729550.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

My Simple 8-Step Guide,"Since March, I've managed to drop 40 lbs , and I'm only about 11 lbs away from my goal weight. After reading everyone else's experiences and figuring out what works for my body, here are the key takeaways:

The 8 Commandments of My Cut

1. Mindful Macros (The Food) Every meal is built around the same formula: Quality Carbs + Lean Protein + High-Fiber Veggies + Healthy Fats. I follow the 80% full rule and cook everything myself using low-oil and low-sodium methods.

2. Just Say No to Snacking This was a huge one. Zero tolerance for snacks between meals. Period.

3. Extend Your Overnight Fast I try to have my dinner around 5 or 6 PM. Giving yourself a longer overnight fast means your body runs out of immediate fuel and starts tapping into fat reserves sooner.

4. Hydrate Like Crazy I make sure to crush at least 2 liters of water daily. It turbocharges your metabolism. Just slow down on the water intake later in the evening to avoid bloat/waking up.

5. Ditch the Liquid Sugar Seriously, cut out the sodas, fruit juices, and especially the sugary boba/milk teas. They are loaded with empty calories. Unsweetened soy milk and plain dairy milk are great protein substitutes.

6. Move Your Body Exercise will make the numbers drop faster, but if you absolutely hate structured workouts, just walking is enough to burn calories and make a difference. Consistency is key.

7. Become Best Friends with Black Coffee Black coffee is an incredible dieting hack. It helps speed up your metabolism and aids in fat burning. If you're serious about the cut, this is a must-have.

8. Get Your Head Straight You need grit and patience for this journey. Don't weigh yourself every single day—daily fluctuations are totally normal. A solid, positive mindset is half the battle. Stay consistent, and the results will follow!

Hope this breakdown helps anyone else on their journey!",9,1764729524.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.91,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I’m not looking for someone to hold my hand through everything, but I’d really value connecting with someone who’s been through this before. Someone who can point out the stuff I’m not thinking about, help me avoid rookie mistakes, and give me honest feedback when I’m off track.
Specifically, I could use guidance on:
	•	Building credibility when you’re just starting out
	•	Actually finding and closing those first few clients
	•	Setting up systems that work instead of just staying busy
	•	Knowing what to focus on vs what to ignore early on
I’m willing to put in the work and figure things out, but having someone who’s already made these mistakes would be huge. If you’ve built a recruiting business (or any service business really) and would be open to grabbing coffee or jumping on a call sometime, I’d appreciate it.

Hi, I'm a 41F who has been dealing with vulvodynia issues for 13 years. Many doctors later and I finally figured out it relates to vulvodynia and most likely a hypertonic pelvic floor. My symptoms: burning (especially during flares), rawness, sensitivity to underwear, can't wear tampons, exams are painful, pain after sex, and the constant feeling of needing to pee (feeling in my urethra, not bladder). I do have constipation issues at times and external hemroids (don't really notice them), & diastasis recti. (The hemroids and diastasis recti was after having babies, everything else was before).

All uti, sti's,yeast, & cystpscopies have come back negative. Pap smears have been normal.

I've tried many things over the years and ice packs have been a life saver. Peri bottle to rinse, blotting with bamboo tp, started bioidentical topical estrogen 6 months ago, topical bioidentical progesterone 12 days of cycle, vitamin D3&K2, vitamin B12, fishoil, calcium citrate, magnesium, fiber, and a probiotic. I also started PT, a pelvic wand, and using a tens unit on my tibial nerve.

Reduced sugar a lot!, I drink one cup organic decaf coffee a day and sometimes no coffee, trying low oxalate diet. I don't drink alcohol or smoke. 

I'll be seeing Dr. Jill Krapf with the CVVD in FL at the end of March.

I used to be on a birth control pill years ago. I have since been blessed with 4 beautiful children. Symptoms started before babies and stayed the same through out. 

The frequent urination feeling is especially awful,  but so is the terrible burning flares although the PT stretches seem to be promising in reducing that. Could be the diet change too.

Anyway, can anyone relate? Thanks in advance! ",1,1764729359.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

For some backstory, me and my grandpa used to be very close when i was young. I’m 20(M) now and he died about a week or two after my 14th birthday. I attended his funeral with a kidney infection and even with a lot of unbearable pain i respected him a lot and stood the whole time the funeral was happening and after.
He was my best friend, biggest support, and only one who listened to me when i had a concern. When i had nightmares as a kid and would wake up in the middle of the night he’d cuddle me up on the couch to watch some WW2 movies and id fall asleep immediately out of boredom. When i experienced my first anxiety/panic attack at a young age before school he took me outside to play a guessing game and then gave me a ride on his bike to school. Long story short, we were close, and he was a wonderful person

He died of lung cancer in his 70s, i remember i didn’t visit much because i wasn’t able to handle the possibility of what ill see, I was a very cowardly kid, and the one time i did visit, i placed my arm on the bed and it accidentally landed on his leg, which was about as thin as my forearm, and i weigh 60kg, so you can imagine. He ignored it and continued asking me about school with his precious smile, and i ran to the bathroom and broke

That was the last time i saw him, the day after he was sent back to the village with grandma (he used to live in our house until i was 12) and died a few weeks after

Last night, I had a dream where im entering a bakery in my town and ordered a lemonade, and when i looked back to the seat i usually take, he was sitting there looking at me and smiling at me. As if he was waiting for me.I was excited to see him and sat down and we started talking. 

He asked me how is my brother, and i told him great, lives alone with his cat and is happy, apart from our dad giving us trouble, we were fine.

He then asked how was mom, his daughter. And i said good, and that her boyfriend is also a much better person than dad ever was, he chuckled at that and said that he was never fond of the man my dad grew into, and that he was much better when he was a teen, but that money got the best of him

He then asked me about college, I told him im prepping up for the entrance exam but I have been working full time at a very nice job for a year now. His smile got even bigger when i said that for some reason. I made a joke how i sometimes smoke the cigarettes he used to, even tho a brand is replaced by something else now (we as a family still keep his last pack) and that they’re super strong, but i can cope through it. He then asked me if i drink the same beer as him which i replied with a fast “absolutely not” because i dont like beer that much, and he laughed so hard

We then finished our drinks and left the bakery to walk outside, we saw an off-brand garfield restaurant and i commented how my friend would love to see this and took a picture, so he asked me about my friends 

I told him i have the best friends i could ask for, and that i really wish he could meet them one day
I was not fully aware of his passing at this moment of the dream

That then reminded me of my boyfriend, so i talked about him too, how he’s everything i could ever ask for, and that he’s very entertaining and interesting, smart and hilarious. and most importantly understanding. He then looked at me with a smile and said that he wishes to grab coffee with him, and that he seems wonderful

We continued walking and i checked my phone, I noticed that it was around the time i should be going for work so he walked me to my bus stop and as i was about to enter, the realization hit me, this is a dream, hes dead. i just said “i really miss you” and he looked at me for a few seconds before the bus door closed and said “i love you” and at the moment it felt like he was letting me go, even tho i should be one letting him go. 

At the doors closing i woke up, and was just in shock for the whole morning 


I dont know what this dream means, i dont know how it even happened, i just got my sick leave yesterday because of a small injury, this was so random, and it got me into a spiral all day

1pcs787,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pcs787/i_explored_an_abandoned_hotel/,I Explored an Abandoned Hotel,"Before the horrors that took place at that hotel, my friends and I had been urban explorers. We had visited several abandoned malls, factories, and entire abandoned neighborhoods. We didn’t do it for money or for valuables that were left behind; we simply enjoyed seeing these structures that seemed to be completely abandoned at a moment's notice. Factories that still had machinery that hadn’t been moved since closing, malls with long abandoned stores with objects that had been left to gather dust. 



My two other friends were actually a couple, and I was their eternal third wheel, but we all had fun together. Merrisa and Justin had been together since pretty much kindergarten, and when I had met them in middle school, they both quickly took a liking to me, and we were soon inseparable from each other. It was in our junior year of high school when we started urban exploring at Justin’s behest. Our first building had been an abandoned house in the neighborhood. We climbed in through a broken window and entered the house, and I soon saw the appeal of it. 



It was a moment frozen in time. The family that had been evicted had been crackheads, and no one had wanted to buy the house, so it had sat for years. So many things had been left behind, and I was amazed by how surreal it felt. Merrisa wasn’t as excited at first, but soon she too fell under the spell. While the two lovebirds explored the upstairs, I stayed downstairs, walking over to the dresser, opening it, and I was amazed to find a photo of the family, in happier times, it seemed. I picked it up and stared at it, before looking around at the state of the house. Their whole life was preserved in this small snapshot. 



We didn’t take anything from the house, but from there, our new hobby was born. Every weekend, we would venture out and search for abandoned houses or properties to explore. We made sure that they were truly abandoned, and never once did we try to break into a property that someone clearly owned. We never made an entrance unless there was already one for us, be it a broken window, an open door, or no door at all. And we always made sure never to take anything, but we did document what we saw. 



We never uploaded any of the footage we used, it was purely for us. We acted stupidly, we told stupid inside jokes that only we knew about. And the most important thing for us, we had so much fun. Even into college, when we were unable to hang out as much, we still made sure to at least once a month, venture out to explore an abandoned property. I wish things could’ve stayed that way, but life had other intentions for the three of us. 



My grandparents were falling ill, and my parents had decided to move across several states to be closer to them, for emergencies, and if the day finally came that we would be needed to plan their funerals. With that, I would be moving away from my two best friends and continuing my studies at a different college. I was devastated, and hoped that there could be some way to stay close to Justin and Merrisa. But without my parents’ financial support, there was simply no way for me to afford an apartment and be a full-time student. Upon telling the couple, they were just as devastated, and the three of us began to think up elaborate ways for me to stay close to them, but they all came to nothing. So it was that two weeks before I was set to move away into some unknown future without them, that Justin texted in the group chat. 



He had found the perfect location for us to do one final exploration together. He kept it a secret from me, and Merrisa was only vaguely aware of where we were going. I was blown away that they were willing to skip that day of school, the two of them had perfect attendance records, just to do one last exploration with me. The plan was quickly drawn up, and the night before they arrived to pick me up, I began to pack my bag. I was bringing the essentials: a portable charger, a flashlight with plenty of backup batteries, a flare in case of emergencies, walkie-talkies, several granola bars, a first aid kit, and plenty of water. Justin always made fun of me for over-preparing, but I’ve always lived by the motto, better to have and not need than to not have and need. 



The morning of our last exploration, I woke up at the crack of dawn and exited out into the crisp morning air. There was a layer of fog just above the grass, and dew stuck to the blades of grass just outside my house. I exhaled gently and watched as my breath turned into steam. It wasn’t shockingly cold, since it was only mid-November, but it was chilly enough in the mornings to get a bit of steam to come out of my mouth. I took in the few minutes of pure silence that surrounded my neighborhood this early in the morning, until I heard a car pulling up to my driveway. 



Justin drove an old, beat-up Pontiac Grand Am, which we all affectionately called, the piece of shit. I was honestly surprised that it had lasted him this long, considering that he had started driving it the moment he got his driver’s permit. The old rust bucket came to a stop, and the doors immediately swung open. Quickly, Justin and Merrisa exited the car and ran over to me, giving me a tight hug and nearly tackling me to the floor with their combined weight. 



Justin was around my height, though he swore that he was taller than me constantly, even though we both measured about 5’8. A ginger with wild red curls, he was a ray of sunshine constantly. His freckled face always wore a smile, and he would do anything for his friends. He took my bag and quickly walked off to put it in the trunk with the rest of the bags that we would be bringing on this last expedition. Merrisa kept hugging me. She was shorter than Justin and me, about 5’4. Her normally dyed hair was in between colors at the moment, with only faded purple at the tips.



“I can’t believe you’re actually leaving us, Anthony!” she said, tears welling up in her eyes. I couldn’t help but sniffle and hug her back tightly. She was like a sister to me, and I cared about her deeply. Justin soon came around and also wrapped his arms around us, pulling us into a deep hug. We all knew this would be the last time we’d see each other and be able to do the thing we all loved to do. I just wish Justin hadn’t picked the hotel. 



He had kept the location a secret even as we drove towards it, only dropping vague hints about it being the greatest location we could’ve hoped to have. The rust bucket was running out of gas on the road, so we quickly pulled into a gas station. At this point, we’d been in the car a few hours already, so Merrisa and I got up to walk around the convenience store, while Justin pumped the car full of gas. 



I looked around the store, not particularly in the mood for any of the options laid out before me, but Merrisa beelined it straight to the energy drinks. As I was looking at the assortment of chips and other snacks, I noticed that Justin wasn’t standing by the car anymore. I looked over and found him at the register. I was going to walk over and ask him if he wanted something, but I quickly overheard him arguing with the gas station attendant, an older black guy. 



“You shouldn’t be heading up there. That place was shut down for a reason, and the last thing we need is a couple of kids digging up bad memories,” he warned, typing on his cash register and pulling out change for Justin. “I’m serious, son. Don’t go up there.” 



“I appreciate the warnings, man. But this is the last time we’ll get to hang out together, and I couldn’t think of a better place than the hotel for us to explore. We aren’t taking anything, and it’s going to be like we were never there to begin with,” Justin explained, putting his wallet back in his pocket and looking towards me, finally noticing that I was listening in. He quickly coughed dramatically and exited the gas station without another word. 



“Poor stupid bastard.” The attendant sighed, staring back down at his counter and just shaking his head. Merrisa quickly walked over and placed her items on the counter, unaware of what had just happened. I left her to pay for her snacks and went over to Justin as he was finishing with the refueling. 



“What was that all about?” I asked him, interrupting him as he replaced the gas cap. He looked at me and then looked behind me to make sure that Merrisa wasn’t close behind me, before pulling me close and whispering to me. 



“We’re exploring an abandoned hotel. A giant one, it was built in the 1910s and then one day just completely abandoned. No clue as to why, or what happened to it. I thought that it was an urban legend or something, but while searching for locations for our last exploration, I stumbled upon a post about someone discovering the hotel.” He pulled me away from the car and pulled his phone out. He pulled up a picture and showed it to me. It showed a blurry picture of what I figured was the hotel we were heading for. 



“Are we sure this place is abandoned? It looks brand new, like they’re going to open again soon.” Indeed, the hotel looked massive, and appeared to have about 12 or 13 floors, and showed no signs of nature having started to reclaim it, no broken windows, not even a tile out of place. It looked immaculate. 



“Crystal, this guy went inside and even took a few pictures of the interior. But you have to pay for those, and I couldn’t be bothered. We might as well go there and see it for ourselves, and it’ll make the perfect final adventure!” He wrapped his arm around my neck and smiled brightly. I was almost convinced, except for what the attendant had said. 



“What did you ask the gas station guy about?” I looked at Justin, and he let go of me, rubbing the curls of red hair on his head. “Were you asking for directions, or something?” I asked, to which Justin shook his head and pulled his phone out to show me the map. It showed that we were only thirty minutes from the approximate location of the hotel. 



“I was just asking if he’d heard about it. Then he started getting all doom and gloom about it. I’m sure he’s just trying to keep us from making a mess of the place. But it’s not like we ever do that.” I was going to question him further, but soon Merrisa joined us with her bags full of snacks, and Justin went to help her, leaving me conflicted about the location. It seemed like a dream come true, an entire hotel for us to explore. But I couldn’t help but think that something horrible lay in wait for us. 



Back on the road, the feeling of dread lingered, but it was soon replaced with joy when at last, after the long car ride jammed in the back of the Grand Am with all the snacks and Justin’s crap, we came to a stop at the edge of some woods. We all exited the car, and in the distance, we could see our destination at last. The hotel rose through the trees like a giant mountain, serving as a lighthouse to guide us. 



I still had reservations about the location, but the sheer size of it, and the possibilities that lay inside finally got the better of me. We all put on our backpacks and made sure the car was locked before we began trekking into the woods towards our destination. Justin quickly found a long stick and used it as a walking stick as we walked through the forest of crunching leaves. It was a slow walk towards the hotel, as the tree roots were hidden beneath the sea of leaves, and every few steps nearly caused us to fall flat on our faces. It seemed like even they were trying to stop us.



 Every few steps, we had to stop and use Justin’s new stick to probe around for any hidden roots. I stared around at the barren forest and couldn’t help but wonder if something was staring back at me unseen. The forest was eerily quiet; only the sound of us walking through the leaves was heard. There wasn’t a single animal around, not even a squirrel. Obviously, there wouldn’t be any birds this late into autumn, but the sheer silence of the forest unnerved me, and I again began to wonder if we should just turn back. 



But at last, we reached the hotel. It was surrounded by a chain link fence with razor wire on the top of the entire perimeter. “There should be a section of fence that got cut out for us,” Justin said, starting to look around at the fence to find it. Merrisa went over to help him while I continued staring up at the hotel. It looked so beautiful, and I couldn’t help but feel that every room in there was probably more expensive than I could ever hope to afford. My previous fears began to evaporate as I began to think of the possibilities waiting for us inside. 



“Found it!” Justin called out, pulling a few piles of leaves away and revealing a section of fence that had indeed been cut. I assumed the previous explorer had made it and left it for others like us to find. Justin took his backpack off and shoved it through the hole before crawling in after it. Merrisa went next, making sure not to snag her puffy jacket on the fence, and then finally it was my turn. I hesitated a moment, those final shreds of apprehension returning as I stared at the fence. 



“C’mon, Anthony! We haven’t got all day!” Merrisa called out as she and Justin put their backpacks back on and began to approach the hotel entrance. I took a deep breath and slipped my backpack off, pushing it through the hole and crawling in after it. Slipping it back on, I quickly raced after them as they walked up to the door. Trying to open it, we found it locked and began searching for a way inside.



“That guy didn’t say how he got inside the hotel?” I asked as I stared at all the windows, hoping that one of them might be cracked or missing. Merrisa was looking around the perimeter as Justin was still trying to get in through the front door, yanking and pulling on it like it was going to do something. 



“I had to pay for further access! I wasn’t about to give that guy 50 bucks.” Justin grunted as he yanked on the door some more, but it seemed to be bolted shut completely. I sighed and looked around further for a way in, almost thankful that the whole trip might have been a bust. That was until I came across a section of the wall that had what appeared to be chalk written on it. 



‘Knock’ was all it said. I stared at it for a moment before looking back over at the door. I walked past this one piece of graffiti and back over to the door, where Merrisa had made her way back to as well to watch Justin act like a monkey pulling on the door. I walked over to the door and simply knocked on it. After a few seconds, the doors loudly unlocked and swung open, sending Justin tumbling down to the floor. 



“How the hell did you do that?!” Justin asked in complete bewilderment. I smiled and shrugged, deciding to keep the secret to myself. I grabbed his arm and yanked him up, and together with Merrisa, we peered into the hotel. What met us was an impenetrable wall of darkness. Justin opened my backpack and pulled out the flashlights I had brought. Once they were distributed to the three of us, we flicked them on and entered the hotel. 



It felt like our flashlights barely penetrated the supreme darkness that ruled inside the hotel. What little we could see of them revealed that the outside wasn’t a facade. The inside was just as immaculate as the outside was, maybe even more so. The carpets looked like they were made of velvet, and the walls were hung with expensive-looking pieces that I was surprised were still hung up. In fact, everything inside looked like it belonged in a museum. We cautiously approached the front desk, and Justin couldn’t help but ring the bell. Its ring was crisp and loud, breaking the silence of the hotel with a loud, deafening ding. 



“Oops, I didn’t think it was going to be that loud.” He giggled, before I punched him in his arm. Merrisa was completely in love with the hotel, as she ran around the giant lobby looking at every inch of art and furniture that she could see. Justin went over to make sure she didn’t get any ideas of taking something with her. I stayed by the desk and looked around, noticing a wall of keys stationed behind the front desk. They were metal keys, and not a single speck of rust existed on them. 



Once Justin had managed to pull Merrisa away from the fancy furniture, we continued through the lobby, heading towards what we figured was the dining room. Even here, everything was spotless and perfect. Not a cobweb, speck of dust, absolutely nothing. Instead of urban exploring, it felt like we had just broken into a hotel that was shut down for renovations. Merrisa and Justin marveled at the set tables, completed with napkins folded into the shape of a swan. 



I started making my way over towards the kitchen when I began to smell food. Not rotting food, actual edible smelling food. Walking to the kitchen, I shone my light through the door and was amazed to find an entire spread of breakfast foods staring back at me. Perfectly done toast, cups of coffee that still had steam coming up from them, eggs done in any style you could think of, all of it looked like it had just been made a few minutes ago. 



“Guys? There’s food over here.” I called out to them. “Like, actual hot food.” They came over quickly and were stunned to see that I wasn’t joking. Merrisa picked up a small pitcher filled with milk and found that it was cold, and the milk wasn’t curdled or spoiled in any way. Justin picked up a cup of coffee and found that it was piping hot. 



“What the hell? Is this place actually open? Or is there like a meeting taking place soon?” Justin asked, placing the cup of coffee back on the service table. 



“Why would they be serving breakfast at 3 in the afternoon?” I asked him. I stared at the food before shaking my head and walking away from it. This was getting too weird, and that nagging feeling of not belonging here began to rear its ugly head back at me. I could tell Justin and Merrisa were also freaked out, but they continued on regardless. 



I followed after them, now painfully aware of how quiet the hotel was. Not a creak, not a groan, not the skitter of rats or anything was coming from the hotel. It was completely silent. I could only hear my own breathing and the sound of our backpacks jingling as we walked. I swear the silence was getting to me, as every few steps we continued down the halls of the hotel, I could feel that something was following us. I stopped every so often to try and see if something was back there. But there wasn’t. 



Eventually, we came upon the ballroom, and Merrisa was again amazed at how beautiful it was. A giant crystal chandelier swung overhead, and when we shone our flashlights on it, it cast a gorgeous array of colors across the floor and walls. We split up again to look around the room, with Justin sticking close to Merrisa. I walked over to the wall to examine what looked like photographs on it. But when I looked at them, I couldn’t tell what they were supposed to be. They were completely smudged, and at first, I thought they were covered in a layer of dust, but they were just strangely smudged. 



“Anthony! Come over here and help Justin! We found a mirror!” Merrisa called over to me. I looked back and nodded, quickly running over and dodging all the chairs and tables to where the two of them were. They were in the middle of the ballroom under the chandelier, and there Justin was pushing an object into place. It was covered with a thick cloth, but it was about six feet tall and had the dimensions I’d expect a mirror to be. 



Justin finally got it into place and came around the mirror to join us before he dramatically pulled the cloth off the mirror to present it to us. Shining our lights away from the mirror just enough to illuminate it, we were greeted by a tall silver-framed mirror. The silver was beautifully engraved with flowers and other designs. We stared at ourselves in the mirror, and I was amazed again that not a single speck of dust touched its brilliant surface. 



I stared at my reflection, my face soft and with the harsh cheekbones that Merrisa constantly told me made me look like an angry old man when I concentrated too hard. My short hair, slightly messy after all the crawling and sitting in the back of Justin’s car. My brown skin with several moles covering my face, it was me, alright. Until it started to not be me. Because I knew for a fact I wasn’t smiling that wide. And I was probably right in assuming that neither was Justin nor Merrisa. 



“What the hell?” I asked, as before our eyes, our reflections began to twist and turn into elongated versions of ourselves. It looked like some unseen force had grabbed our reflections and begun to stretch them into long, gangly versions of ourselves. It would’ve been bad enough that this was happening, but then my reflection pushed its face against the mirror and began to emerge from inside of it. 



“Oh my God!” Merrisa screamed as she quickly grabbed Justin’s arm and began to run away from the mirror. I quickly followed after them as I heard the creature fall to the floor behind us. We made it to the door to the ballroom and quickly turned to leave. Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw the other two reflections begin to emerge from the mirror as well. 



“What the hell was that mirror?!” Justin asked as we sprinted into the lobby and made a beeline to the front door. We would have to figure it out later once we were back to safety, but when we tried to open the door, we found that somehow it had now locked from the outside. I quickly shone the light on the door handles, and to our horror, we saw that there was no lock mechanism. I tried knocking, hoping that it might work, but this time the doors remained shut tightly. 



Suddenly, from behind us, we heard fast scurrying. The three of us turned around and shone our lights back in the direction of the ballroom. Merrisa screamed when she saw my reflection sprinting towards us at full sprint. It ran on all fours like some kind of big cat predator. And in an instant, it lunged at us. I quickly shoved both Justin and Merrisa away, slamming us into the ground as I shoved them to the side. 



My reflection crashed into the door with a loud crack, which I hoped might break the door. Instead, I watched as its long neck dangled to the side of its torso. I thought for a moment it had broken its neck. That was until its milky white eyes turned to look at us, and a giant, toothy smile spread across its face. It flopped its neck back into place and began to laugh at us. A high-pitched laugh that somehow both matched and didn’t match with its long twisted body. 



“Run!” I screamed at Merrisa and Justin. They quickly scrambled up to their feet and began running towards another hallway, one filled with hotel rooms. I followed after them as the creature that looked like me continued to laugh. And suddenly I heard several other pairs of legs following after us. 



“There! Stairs at the end of the hall!” Justin shouted. Shining my light down the hall, I saw that indeed, there was a door leading to a set of stairs. Justin raced ahead and quickly swung the door open. Merrisa ran through, and I heard her start to run up the stairs at full sprint. I quickly tried to follow after her, and as I reached to door, I could tell by Justin’s face and the sounds coming from behind me, that those things were right behind me. 



I quickly ran to the stairs and turned to see if Justin was following after me. Just as I watched him enter the stairwell, a gangly arm grabbed his legs and yanked him back out into the hall. I watched in horror as he was dragged back into the hall and as the creatures began to laugh together. 



I looked back up the stairs to see if Merrisa was still there, but I could see her light high up the stairwell; it seemed in a blind panic, she had kept running and running. I heard Justin grunting and fighting and knew I had to do something. I quickly ran into the hall and saw that Justin was desperately clinging to the doorframe, desperately trying to kick the creatures away from him. The one that looked like him was the one who had grabbed his leg and was currently trying to pull the rest of Justin towards him. I quickly grabbed onto Justin’s arms and tried to pull him back into the stairwell. 



“Hold on, man!” I shouted at him, trying my best to yank him in. I heard a giggle, and looking up, I saw that the other two reflections were sitting like dogs not too far away, both of them drooling in anticipation. I had to get Justin out, and I did my best to try and pull him, but his mirror version was much stronger than the two of us, and I could feel Justin’s grip on me and the doorframe slipping. 



Then it seemed that the Merrisa reflection grew too bored to wait, because it lunged at Justin’s leg and, in one swift bite, tore his leg off below the knee. I stared in shock as Justin began to bleed from his stump. The world went quiet as I stared at my best friend; it even felt like the world slowed down as I stared at the mirror creatures. Justin’s reflection seemed furious that the Merrisa creature had taken his food, because it immediately ignored us and pounced on her, quickly biting the other end of Justin’s leg and starting to try and tug it away from the Merrisa monster’s mouth. 



I didn’t have time to watch this, so while they were distracted, I quickly pulled Justin back into the stairwell and shut the door behind us. Justin was screaming in pain, and he was bleeding out fast. “Hold on, man!” I shouted at him, quickly ripping my belt off my pants and wrapping it around his leg. I pulled it as tight as I possibly could, hoping to stop as much of the blood as possible. I then took my jacket off and then my t-shirt. I quickly wrapped Justin’s stump as much as I could.



“Justin? Stay with me, brother.” I told him, quickly slapping his face a bit when his screaming stopped. I was worried he’d go into shock, but judging by his breathing and the fact he was reacting slightly to my slaps, it seemed he’d just passed out from the pain. We couldn’t stay here in the stairwell, so I quickly helped Justin up onto his one leg and began dragging and carrying him up the stairs. 



We made it to the fourth floor before I got exhausted from carrying all the weight of both him and the backpacks. I entered the fourth-floor rooms, and I sat Justin down against the wall of the hallway, looking for one of the doors that might be open. There was room after room, but all of them seemed to be locked up tightly. I looked around for a room and saw that the closest one to us was 426. Making a mental note of the room, I turned to Justin. His face was growing pale, and his breathing was getting shallower. 



“Justin? Talk to me here, brother.” I told him, walking over to him and opening one of my bottles of water, quickly splashing him in the face with it. He suddenly shot to life, and just as quickly was about to scream before I covered his mouth with my hand and shushed him. “I know it hurts like a bitch. But I need you to stay as quiet as you can, okay? I need to try and get the key to one of the rooms here. I’ll be right back, okay? I promise you.” He nodded through teary eyes. I gave him the water bottle and also retightened the belt as much as I could, which got a silent grunt and scream of pain from Justin. 



I left the backpacks with him and ventured back down the stairs to the first floor. I placed my ear against the door to see if I could hear the reflections. I didn’t, and so I cautiously opened the door

and stuck my head out into the pitch darkness of the hallway. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my keys as quietly as I could. Gently, I removed my flashlight keychain and cautiously turned it on. The light was enough for me to see a few feet in front of me, so I began to walk down the hallway.



There were stains of blood everywhere on the carpet, and I figured that the reflections must have gotten into a fight over Justin’s leg. The deafening silence once again began to play tricks on me. I couldn’t be sure if it was my mind doing something or if it was one of the monsters. But my friend was bleeding out, and I needed to hurry, so I started running to the front desk, all the while hearing strange noises coming from somewhere near me. I did my best to ignore it, reaching the desk and quickly jumping over it to the other side. 



Staring at the wall of keys, I found the key for Room 426. I swiped it and began my journey back down the hall towards the stairwell. As I did so, that strange noise continued to follow me. I stopped every few steps, and it seemed to stop as well. I shone my light behind me, but there wasn’t anything back there. I swallowed the bile building up in my throat and quickly made my way to the stairwell, still being followed by the strange noise. 



When I finally arrived at the door, I reached my arm out to open it, and as I did, I felt a wet sticky substance fall from the ceiling onto my hand. The ceiling. I stood frozen for a moment before I stared back up and saw that my own reflection was staring back at me. It was hanging from the ceiling and drooling at the sight of me. I quickly opened the door and slammed it behind me just as my reflection dropped down and tried to break down the door. I sprinted up the stairs, staring down at the steps in horror when I saw that Justin had left a trail of blood the entire way up to the 4th floor. But I didn’t have time to think of that, I had to get him to safety first. I burst out onto the 4th floor and was thankful to see that Justin was still alive and conscious. 



I quickly ran to the room and inserted the key, getting the door open before running back and lifting Justin back up to his foot, and helping him into the room. I quickly also tossed out backpacks into the room, before closing and locking it behind me. Panting and completely out of breath, I slid down the door and panted on the floor for a few seconds. But I didn’t have too long to wait and catch my breath. I quickly got back up and tended to Justin’s wound. 



“W-where’s Merrisa?” He grunted in pain as I retightened the tourniquet I’d made for him. I opened my backpack and quickly pulled out the first aid kit. It paid to have a mom who was a nurse, because she always made sure that we had a first aid kit and that we would have everything we needed inside it. 



“I don’t know, she ran further upstairs. After I clean your wound, I’ll go looking for her, okay?” I told him, and he nodded, wincing in pain. I knew he was in pain, but what I was about to do was probably going to be much more painful. I held up the bottle of rubbing alcohol to him. He stared at me for a moment before nodding. I walked over and got as many towels as the room had in stock before offering him one to bite into. He bit down on it before nodding at me. I pulled off my t-shirt from his leg stump and quickly began to douse the stump in alcohol. 



Justin screamed and grunted in pain, smashing his fist into the mattress and convulsing in pain. I felt horrible doing this to him, but I had to make sure he didn’t get infected from the wound. I used one of the bottles of water to wet the towel and began to clean his wound to the best of my ability. The beautifully white towels were soon stained a deep red, along with the mattress covers. After I had cleaned up his wound, I used gauze from the first aid kit to wrap up his stump. 



“That’s the best I can do for right now,” I told him, and he nodded, panting in pain with tears streaming down his face. I looked around the hotel room we’d run into in a panic. It was beautiful and even had a minifridge. 



“Merrisa…please, go find her, Anthony. I’ll be okay here,” he told me through a quivering voice. I wasn’t sure if I believed him, but I knew I had to go find her as well. I nodded, checking his tourniquet again, before wrapping my arms and hugging him tightly. 



“I’m coming right back, okay? Try to stay awake and whatever you do, don’t make any noises.” I patted him on the back before taking my backpack and pulling out an extra shirt I had packed. Pulling it over my head and then putting my backpack on, I waved goodbye to Justin and softly exited into the hall. I let out a shaky sigh, wondering how it had all fallen apart so quickly. But I didn’t have time to think about that, I had to find Merrisa. As I exited out into the stairwell, I shone my flashlight down the stairs and came face to face with my reflection. It was busy licking up all the blood that Justin had left behind. 



“Shit!” I screamed as it looked up at me with a smile and a high-pitched giggle. I started to run up the stairs, with the sounds of the reflection following close behind me. I panted hard, suddenly realizing how exhausted I was, as I began to slow down while sprinting up the stairs, while my reflection was easily keeping up with me. Suddenly, I came upon an open door on the 7th floor. Merrisa had to have gone through there, so I pulled my backpack off and spun on my heel to face my reflection. 



Just as it turned the corner, I swung my backpack against its face. Caught off balance and seemingly by surprise, it tumbled back down to the floor and down the flights of stairs it had just run up. Panting hard, I felt a violent need to throw up, but I managed to keep it down before entering the hallway of the 7th floor. I shone my light around the hall, looking for any sign of Merrisa. I soon stumbled upon her. What was left of her.



Her reflection and Justin’s were in the middle of devouring the last few pieces of her. Her head lay on the floor, cracked open and oozing out brains and blood. The reflections were digging into her torso, and when Justin’s reflection yanked out her intestines, Merrisa’s reflection, which had been snapping bones in half and sucking the marrow out, turned to Justin’s reflection and pounced on it, snarling and growling and trying to yank the intestines out of the reflection of Justin’s mouth. 



They were so busy trying to yank on the intestines that they paid no notice to me. All I could do was stare at Merrisa’s eviscerated corpse and turn to leave. I made my way back towards the stairwell, but thinking my reflection was probably making its way back up after me, I decided instead to keep walking down the hall, hoping to find the stairwell on the other end of the hall. Eventually, I found it and began to make my way back down to the 4th floor. 



Before I entered the hallway, I sat down on the stairs and began to cry uncontrollably into my hands. What was I going to tell Justin? Justin…the blood trail. A horrible feeling fell into my stomach, and I quickly shot back up and began sprinting towards the room I had left Justin in. And to my horror, I saw that the door was broken down. 



“Justin!” I screamed, heading into the room, and screaming in anguish when I saw that my reflection was in the process of ripping into Justin’s flesh. It snapped its head over to look at me and growled at me. I saw that Justin had managed to stab it with a pocket knife several times, and the knife was now sticking out of my reflection’s eye. “You piece of shit!” I screamed at it, wanting to tackle my horrifying doppelganger and rip him to shreds myself. But all it did was stare at me and giggle, and I realized that its giggles sounded like a hyena’s. And soon, down the hall, I heard two other giggles. Flashing my light down the hall, I saw that Merrisa and Justin’s reflection had followed me down the stairs and into the hall. 



I had to do something. As they slowly stalked towards me, giggling and licking their gore-covered faces, I dug into my backpack and found two items that were my best chance a survival. The bottle of rubbing alcohol and my road flare. Leaving my flashlight on the floor, I quickly lit the flare and shone it towards the reflections of Merrisa and Justin. They stopped in their tracks and yipped and screeched in terror at the sudden blinding light and loud hissing that the flare made. 



I slowly began to back up towards the stairwell, carefully unscrewing the cap of the bottle of rubbing alcohol. My reflection, seemingly done with eating Justin, exited out into the hallway and also began to follow after me, keeping a safe distance from the flare, but slowly following me as I continued to back up. Making it to the stairwell, I quickly turned and ran down the stairs, followed quickly after by the three reflections. When I reached the bottom, I turned and threw the bottle of alcohol at them. It caught them off guard as they hissed and growled at me. But a moment later, I threw the flare at them, and they went up in a blinding orange flame. 



They screeched in an earsplitting scream and quickly began to claw at themselves and at each other as they burned. I quickly closed the door to the stairwell and shoved myself against it as they tried in vain to escape. I stayed there until the screams finally stopped, and slowly opening the door, I was met with the scene of the charred corpses becoming horribly twisted and mangled together as they burned brightly together. 



I closed the door to the stairwell and slowly began to make my way to the lobby, before I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion. I don’t know how, but eventually I woke up in an intensive care unit. From what they told me, I’d been found alone in the woods, rambling and screaming incoherently. They thought I was on drugs, but when I was brought to the hospital, they found that I had none in my system. 



They also found Justin’s car, and he and Merrisa were declared missing people. I tried to tell the police about the hotel, the mirror, and the reflections of us that had spawned from the mirror. But they didn’t believe me, they thought I had something to do with it, they were sure I’d done something to Justin and Merrisa in a drug-fueled state. They locked me in a psych ward because of what I keep saying. 



The one saving grace of being here is that there are no mirrors in my room. I don’t think I could ever bear to see my own reflection ever again.

The William comes with the timed dosing preprogrammed:

• Double: 5.5 seconds

Her scale hasn’t arrived yet, but visually the double dose doesn’t even look like enough to be a single. The only way to get the basket to look even close to properly filled is to grind very coarse. 3 is where it looks like most people run them on the internet but I have to run it at 6 or 7 for it to “look right.” At those settings the coffee has a sandy feel.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

I am based on the east coast but am a frequent business traveler to SF, coming to town monthly for 4-5 day stints including some weekend stopovers.  I will next be in town Dec 3-7.  I can host in my upscale downtown hotel.

I’m here often enough that I’d like to find a local connection - something easy and without strings.  I’d love to find someone I can be flirty and playful with.  I’d love to grab coffee or a cocktail, or enjoy a dinner date.  Maybe check out a weekend market or go on a hike? 

Something fun where we can hang out, flirt, and see where things go without feeling forced or rushed.  I’m someone who likes to build playful tension and release it explosively when the time’s right.

Physically: I am tall (6ft4 - come climb me like a tree!) and in decent shape.  I’m no gym rat but I do regular bootcamp style exercises.  I’m handsome and well put together.  I am well endowed but won’t assault your eyes with unwelcome anatomical photographs.  

Personality: I’m an educated professional, normal, sane, and respectful of your time and your boundaries.  I’m kind, easy-going, funny, and quick to smile.  I’m playful and flirty.

Interests: Outside of work I’m a traveler who takes several international trips every year. I’ve visited over forty countries and love being outside of my element. I am an experienced home chef and love spending time in the kitchen. I hike and bike. I love drinking bourbon next to a campfire.

Bedroom stuff: I am drug, drama, and disease free and ask that you be also - especially the drama and disease part.  I’m 420 friendly.  I’m not too concerned about your personal situation, we’re all adults here and I’m not looking to be indiscreet with whatever you may have sensitivities about.

I’m into both vanilla connections and kinky ones. I am very sex positive and kink-friendly, so articulate your needs and curiosities without hesitation or shame. I try to be a walking safe space, respectful of boundaries. I get the most sexual satisfaction from my partner having a great time.

Let’s take this online, shall we? If this post caught your attention, please send me a chat and tell me about yourself and what caught your eye. Can’t wait to connect.",1,1764728917.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

original post: i need help finding this one bl that i was reading at 3am and i have a very blurry memory of the main couple and a slightly vivid memory of the side. for the main couple i’m pretty sure this was an office romance because they did work in the same company and they were pretty much enemies until they got into an arrangement and started sleeping together like usual. i don’t remember much but the top had brown hair and tanish white skin while the bottom had black hair and pale skin. now for the side couple i remember a lot. i’m pretty sure it was between a boss and a new hired employee. the boss was the bottom with pink hair, pale skin, and a kind of pouty personality and the new employee had tan skin with black hair and he always delivered coffee to the boss as the only way to talk to him. eventually some way they slept together but why that was going on the boss had his own problems which was threatening letters. one day when the boss was at the new employee’s home, he found a letter and it was the same stalker letters he was receiving so he decided to avoid contact with the new employee until he was alone in his home and discovered it was his ex who was sending the notes and the ex tried to break into his house, so the boss started to scream that the guy aka the new employee he was sleeping with was way better than his ex and the ex was about to break into but the new employee protected him and called the cops and i’m pretty sure they slept together and again and that’s how it ended. 

**titles that op have said it’s not**: 
- love shuttle
- the new employee 
- on or off 
- perfect buddy
- undercover partners 
- the boss in the bedroom 
- fake fact lips 
- you and i can’t do this 
- flirting 6 to 9

1pcs2lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/excatholic/comments/1pcs2lq/excatholics_who_are_still_christian_what/,Ex-Catholics who are still Christian- What denomination are you?,"A little about me- 

Baptized Roman Catholic. Deeply religious as a child. Had a crisis of faith after a scandal in my area that affected a close friend of mine and seeing the ugly effects on that person’s life and health. Ended up not getting confirmed which caused a rupture in my family. 

I am also a member of the lgbt community (I’ll leave it at that since honestly I don’t want hate comments- I know this is a friendly sub but you can never be sure) and this is also part of why I left. I prayed, went to conversion therapy, even self injured in an attempt to make it “go away”. 

It did not and I am since recovered. I eventually became a full blown atheist pretty quickly after leaving the church. Unfortunately due to the social climate of where I live (even secular spaces) and my family’s attitudes I have lived a very rough life. I won’t go into detail but I’ve experienced essentially trauma after trauma. My life is stable now and I’ve done therapy and all that but I still live with the things I’ve experienced. 

After a decade of being an atheist (I know there are many here!) Life feels… empty. I miss the sacraments. The coffee hours. Having hope and something to believe in. For various cultural and personal reasons, I find myself wanting to return to saint veneration and Christian spirituality. I find myself collapsing into nihilism and despair without it. I’m making a conscious, intellectual choice to engage with religion again because I think it fills core human needs and helps me connect to my heritage. I’m not interested in a religion vs atheism debate although I respect all beliefs. 

Here is my issue. After over a decade and a half I find myself disillusioned with my identity and lgbt community. I still feel the want to be normal and feel that maybe I brought everything I’ve been through upon myself by insisting on pride, selfishness and sin. I keep hoping I can snap out of it and go back to being someone people could love. Even if I could, it wouldn’t erase my life history. I find myself really susceptible to ex-lgbt narratives and I find myself in really low places still.

I feel drawn to going back to Catholicism because it has a particular psychology that deeply resonates to me in its unique art, music, traditions and liturgy. I also hope that it could fix me somehow and I could be redeemed. 

I also think a healthier thing could be going to a more progressive “high church” atmosphere but I get scared without the authority of the church and I worry they’re right. There’s so many denominations and opinions and I don’t know what to believe. Protestantism is too individualistic to me. Being in a church that is lgbt-affirming feels less serious, like they’re bending to the world and just telling me what I want to hear. 

I’ve honestly experienced just as much damage being in the LGBT community as when I was closeted because I found people to validate unhealthy echo chambers and bad life choices I’m also stepping away from. I feel desperate for some sort of positive guidance and have no idea where to find it. I miss when Sunday school was just about being kind and giving to others.

1pcs2fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1pcs2fa/ive_never_had_anyone_show_me_positive_interest_im/,I've never had anyone show me positive interest. I'm depressed and terrified to be on my own.,"I'm a 19 year old guy in college and idek I'm just so lonely it kills me. 

Idek where to begin, I'm just gonna rant and hopefully something coherent will be eligible in this word vomit.

I really want a relationship. I really really really do. I don't want hookups or sex, I just want someone to hang out with and care for and all that jazz. Idk I want someone to be my number 1 y'know, someone who actually wants me around and has fun with me.
But no matter how hard I try I can never find a relationship.

I have friends. They're okay. No they're good, but they don't come without their issues. I've realized that, with them, nothing i do matters. My suggestions are ignored, my advise is treated like shit. Anything I make and show them is glossed over. Nothing I do matters. And that really sucks. But that's also the case with my family too. They don't really care about anything I do and are always so quick to jump to say that I'm wrong no matter what. They're all so stubborn that they'll latch onto and idea after 3 milliseconds and refuse to change their mind. They judge me for the things I like and I struggle to have real conversations with them, because I know they'll just blame me for it.

Last year I fell hard for this girl. She was the only person in my life who actually seemed like they liked me for me. Unfortunately it was all fake so she could use me for emotionally cheating on her boyfriend. 
I talked to my mom about that, I said it really hurt and I don't know what to do and I need some advice. 
She basically said ""it's your fault she used you, because you never asked if she was in a relationship.""
And that broke me. That made me realize that no matter what, I'm always in the wrong. It doesn't matter if that girl and I did everything together for 4 months. It doesn't matter that she never once mentioned s boyfriend in all of our time together. It's my fault. All my fault.

Idek man. After that I tried asking out a few more girls, but it all ended the same. I'd say something about myself, they'd go ""ew gross"" and leave. And eventually I just gave up. I havtn been on a date since March of last year and I feel so hopeless.

It just seems that no matter what I do, I'm either, invisible, stupid, or worthless. 

I don't even like wierd things, I like dinosaurs, I like Nintendo games, I like drawing, I like 3d modeling and printing. That's all pretty normal right? 

Yet anytime I mention it I'm either a corporate sellout or autistic just because I say I like dinosaurs.

Idek. I don't talk to strangers anymore. First off I have nothing to say, and second even if I did, they're not gonna like me.

I really don't get it. Am I actually a horrible person and that's why nobody likes me? Or am I just unlucky.
I don't think I'm a bad person, but what the hell do I know.

I've tried therapy, but it doesn't work. I have to wait 2 weeks just to talk for 45 minutes, and for my therapists to half pay attention. I've tied 2 so far and have had the same result.

Honestly I'm loosing hope. I'm so terrified of graduating college alone. Like I don't want to go out into the real world alone. I want to have someone to experience it with, someone to make mistakes with and figure out solutions. Just someone on my side y'know. But it's not looking good.

I haven't even held hands with a girl. 

Idek man, I never had silly fling in high school, I never had a one night stand. I've never gotten an ounce of real positive attention from someone. Never.
And that's just lead me to believe that I'm worthless. 
Like genuinely, if my own mother thinks so little of me, maybe it's true.

And this goes back to my earlier point, maybe I am a shitty human being and I just don't know it.

Idk man. I just really don't know.

And I'm not saying I want some perfect angle to come in and fix my life, that's unrealistic. But I at least want someone to actually want me. I want someone to show me that it is possible to be loved, and not just some far off fantasy.

Idk man, I'm terrified of not getting a job. My major is animation, and it's impossible on a good day to get hired. The industry sucks ass right now. I have backup plans, but even if I do get a job and a house and money, if I'm doing it alone, I'm going to hate it.

Idk I just want connection and I can't seem to find it anywhere. Clubs don't work, sitting in the library or coffee shops doesn't work. Thers nobody in my major. I don't have a car so I cant go anywhere special. There's nobody at my jobs. 

I read some stories of people joking about how they missed ques that women liked them. And I thought about it and realized that nobody ever has said anything remotely similar to me. They just ignore me. I'm a secondary friend. A backup. 

Yeah idk that's kinda the end of the rant.

⸻

🎄 “Trent the Secret Elf” — Full Song

(Cheerful Christmas style — upbeat, magical, a little humorous)

⸻

🎶 Verse 1

All year long he’s just a guy,
Punchin’ in from nine to five,
Sippin’ coffee, wearin’ jeans,
Livin’ life just like you and me.

But when the lights start hittin’ the town,
And the first snow starts comin’ down,
He gets a twinkle nobody can tell…
That’s when Trent becomes an elf.

⸻

🎶 Pre-Chorus

He’s got a secret he can’t mention,
A December-only mission…
Clock strikes midnight, he disappears,
Like he’s done for years and years—

⸻

🎶 Chorus

🎄 ’Cause Trent… oh Trent…
He’s a secret Christmas elf!
You won’t find him at the office,
He’s up north upon the shelf!
Wraps the toys and checks the lists,
Helps ol’ Santa make the gifts—
When December bells all chime,
Trent becomes an elf in time. 🎄

⸻

🎶 Verse 2

All his friends think he’s away,
“Family trip,” he likes to say.
But he’s flyin’ through the polar night,
Candy-cane stripes glowin’ bright.

Hammer tapping, sleigh bells ring,
Trent’s the one who oils the springs,
Fixes Santa’s magic sleigh…
He’s the elf who saves the day.

⸻

🎶 Pre-Chorus

Snowflakes swirling ’round his boots,
Hot cocoa and peppermint fruits—
He’s got work till Christmas Eve,
Then he slips back quietly—

⸻

🎶 Chorus

🎄 Yeah Trent… our Trent…
He’s a secret Christmas elf!
All year long he blends right in,
But in December he can’t help himself.
Helps the reindeer train and fly,
Tunes the sleigh so it can glide—
When December’s in the air,
Trent the elf is always there. 🎄

⸻

🎶 Bridge

He keeps the secret close and tight,
But we all see that sparkle bright…
In his smile there’s Christmas cheer,
He’s the elf of every year.

And when Santa shouts, “Let’s go!”
Trent’s already in the snow—
Ready with his magic tools,
Breaking all the North Pole rules!

⸻

🎶 Final Chorus

🎄 Oh Trent… sweet Trent…
Our undercover holiday friend!
From January back to fall,
He hides his magic from us all.
But when Christmas time is near,
He returns to spread the cheer—
Trent the elf, we know it’s true…
The North Pole always waits for you! 🎄

1pcrz30,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcrz30,Kitchen Layout Help,"Hi, I am trying to figure out the layout for my kitchen and need to make a decision by the end of the week so the rough-ins can be completed.  I don’t like the one that the interior designer came up with so am looking for alternatives.  Her version was very close to Kitchen 1 but had the stove in the island, which I do not want.  We have a really nice view to the backyard so I’m pretty stuck on having the sink where it is, which is at the window. We also plan on having an 8 ft patio door looking onto the backyard.  I am hesitant to put the fridge near the patio door because I feel like it will block the view and make that area feel more closed off but I’m not completely against it. I should also mention that I am using the island as my third point of the kitchen triangle rather than the fridge. I always take stuff from the fridge and put it on the counter so this makes more sense to me. 

Kitchen 1 (2 wall of cupboards with island in the middle) 

Pros:
- more room around the dining room table
- decent counter space on both sides of the sink
- secondary set of cabinets with appliance garages.  This would also be a spot for the coffee machine.  
- dishwasher would be panel ready so there wouldn’t be 2 stainless steel appliances next to each other. This would look nice and I don’t think I would pay the extra cost for panel the other layout. 
- main counter area would stay less cluttered with appliances, which is an issue in my current kitchen.

Cons:
- Not as much clearance around the island.        - Island would only have a 12” overhang.
- May have to get a counter depth fridge or the corner will feel cramped walking around the island 
- dishes drying will be the in the same space where you would have things for cooking

Kitchen 2 (L shaped kitchen)

Pros:
- Ample space around the island, better flow
- 15” overhang on the island instead of 12”
- room for a full depth fridge 

Cons:
- less counter space between sink and stove
- not a huge fan of the corners in L shaped kitchens.
- all of our counter top appliances will be shoved into that corner like we have it now which bothers me.  The kitchen always looks messy. 
- we have a fairly large espresso machine and I don’t know where it would go in the layout. 

I would love to hear some opinions and any suggestions of different layout ideas.

""I'm really sad to leave this review because I truly enjoyed the coffee and getting to the see the kitty cats. My first time in was Sunday Nov 30. My partner and I were there for coffee, then yesterday Dec 1, we had a reservation for 1 pm to meet the kitties. We had a fantastic time EXCEPT for the fact that there was a smaller child in there at the same time, possibly 7 or 8 years old, who was running around the lounge being really rambunctious, stressing the cats out, and just being an overall disturbance to other patrons, but most importantly the cats. Miss Alice, who was so incredibly sweet, got overwhelmed by this child and hissed and swatted at my partner. Not Alice's fault! In fact I felt terrible for Alice that a space that is suppose to be safe for her, felt so overwhelming that she felt like she had to do that. Towards the end of our visit, he began spinning the wheel very fast, while trying to get a cat to jump onto it while it was moving... clearly unsafe, otherwise we wouldn't have been told to not touch it before we entered. A staff member came in a did inform him that he can't touch the wheel. He continued to do so, she came back in and told him again to stop. It was the end of our reservation so I don't know if the child stopped right away. I wanted to mention something to staff, but since our reservation ended right as the cafe closed, I didn't want to keep them from going home. Obviously this is a parenting flaw and not the cafes fault that children can't behave in environments that are sensitive such as the cat lounge. With that in mind, I do believe there is something the cafe could do about small children. I understand that the rules are ""Children over 1yr (12mo) require reservation. Children under 12yr require accompanying adult."" I do believe the cats and the lounge would benefit from applying an age restriction all together, and not allow under a certain age to come into the space. Because it’s very clear that even accompanied children aren’t behaving like they should. Cat cafes shouldn't be treated as a playground for young children who have yet to discover what impulse control, spatial/situational awareness or gentleness is. They are designed to be quiet, controlled environments so rescued cats can learn to trust humans and find homes. I apologize for the long review, I just feel so passionately about the well-being of cats, especially cats that are waiting to be adopted.""",43,1764728167.0,childfree,7,1.0,False

1pcrvu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pcrvu2/27f_25m_is_this_relationship_truly_over/,27F & 25M is this relationship truly over?,"Hi Reddit,

so this is a long story but i could use some advice. my boyfriend and I broke up in april 2025. We'd been together for almost 2 years and were extremely in love. We were from the same home state, went on trips together, met families, talked about our future. We live in a major city now and we met at the restuarant he works at that is downstairs from where i live. We talked about moving in together, getting married, moving back to our home state eventually. it felt like I found my person. Not only all of that, but we had amazing communication, it felt like we could talk about anything and our relationship is unlike anything either of us had expereinced before. 

So March comes, and he tells me he is really depressed and cant seem to get out of it. he started getting really weird when we talked aabout moving in together which was coming up at some point in the near future. he ended up breaking up with me but didnt seem entirely sure about it and just wasnt himself at the end. I was devastated. 

2 months later he came back saying that i was the one think in his life that was missing and he realized he wants this. I told him that he needed to start therapy before i consider this again. I also started therapy and it seemed like we were both on the right track. over the spring & summer we were talking regularly, would have conversations about our relationship, what we wanted, what went wrong, how we wanted to go about starting again. 

we had decided to wait until the fall to really have the conversation and in the meantime we would meet for coffee, catch up, and try to support each others independent healing. we also werent sleeping with other people at this point. So september comes and he is working a ton, it was a 1 1/2 month long work stint where he was basically working long hours every day with no weekends. he was still talking to me at this point and just was really exhausted which i totally understood. 

by october, we met for coffee and had the talk about ok is it time we start really talking about getting back together and we both seemed to agree it was about that time and were going to take the month to start building the relationship back up. it seemed like he was happy about this. And then he just turred off again, he was dry texting, not making plans, just keeping me at an arms length is how it felt. eventually i got pretty pissed about it all and stopped putting in as much effort too. We had plans to hang out one day and he just never texted me. i was really hurt and pretty much competely done. i texted him that night and asked if he forgot and he replied with yes im sorry i spent too much time at a bar today and spaced. and then asked if we could do today instead. i didnt reply for over a day and he called me and apologized. I asked him to come over the next day to talk. he came over and this is when we ended for good. he was saying that he was so exhausted from this work stint he had (which ended like that week) and didnt feel like himself and was too lazy to try and work on our relationship. he said he loves me more that hes ever loved anyone and he wishes we could just go back to when it was good but doesnt want to work on things to get them there. i told him i wasnt going to beg him to be with me and that he should probably leave. I also said that it shouldnt necessarilly feel like work to get back together and we would eventually get back to the relationship we had but its not just going to happen overnight and it takes time and effort from both of us. its just so weird because it honestly felt like he was forcing himself to push me away even though everything leading up to this conversation didnt seem like he was unsure about still wanting this.

ive been really depressed since this breakup and just emotionally drained. i really wanted this to work and it felt like i was giving my all but he (in his words) was just too lazy. it sucks. theres a lot more to this story, this is just a short version of everything that happened. but i could really use some advice. I still love him so much but i cant tell if its just my fear of moving on and having to start from scratch.",1,1764728130.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I use two Porta filters, one's a single and one's a double. I use both everyday and it's just easier having the two Porta filters. Recently when I choose a  double the porta filter isn't filling up enough. If I adjust how much grind comes out to make a double shot then when I go back to a single shot the single Porta filter overflows. If I adjust it so the single shot works perfect then when I go back to a double there isn't enough coffee in there and I can't tamp it down correctly and it takes like 15 seconds to make a shot because there isn't  enough coffee in the porta filter and there isn't any real pressure on the guage. I thought I read somewhere about adjusting how much grind comes out for a double shot. If I get the single shot perfect I thought you could switch to a double shot then push a couple buttons at the same time and then release them after visually watching how much coffee is dispensed and that will stay in memory for the second shot. I never used to have to adjust how fine the coffee was or how much coffee came out with that little grey dial on the front. But somehow in the last little while a double shot portafilter isn't twice as much as a single shot. I have even tried using the double shot portafilter and selecting single shot on the machine and once it does the single I re push the porter filter in and do another single but that still isn't quite filling up the portafilter.

I’ve been talking to a woman at my gym since August. She’s **reserved**, not the flirty type, not someone who hugs random guys or makes strong eye contact with strangers. But with *me*, she opened up extremely fast — within 3–4 interactions she was already telling me about her marriage issues.

That alone confused me because I’ve known married people for YEARS who never told me anything personal. But she unloaded very early.

## **What she tells me:**

She repeats the same story all the time:

* She and her husband “don’t talk at home at all”
* They sleep in separate rooms
* They’re “basically roommates for their child”
* She’s moving out “soon” (but every month the date changes and she has a new excuse)
* She says he begs her every day to work things out
* She says she tells him no
* She claims she’s been looking into separation/divorce but hasn’t talked to a lawyer

But despite saying all that…

### **They still go out together:**

* concerts
* bars
* mall outings
* hookah lounges

And when I ask how that works, she laughs and says it’s “awkward.”

It’s hard for me to tell if:

**1. she’s lying to make herself look single/available to me**
or
**2. her home situation is just genuinely messy and inconsistent**

Sometimes she slips. For example, she told me she and her husband “don’t talk at all,” but then started telling me how his car got into an accident. When I asked a follow-up question, she stopped herself and said, “Oh wait—I forgot, I told you we don’t talk at home,” then brushed it off.

So I’m trying to understand the body-language angle here: **is she hiding things or trying to appear more single?**

---

# **Her behavior toward me:**

This is where the mixed signals get stronger:

* She hugs me often (but she isn’t a hugger with most people)
* She asks my “type of girl”
* She asked if I hooked up with anyone when I was traveling
* She seemed a little jealous
* She shows me IG profiles of random women and asks if she should follow them back
* She often asks to work out together
* Sometimes *she* initiates gym plans first
* She’s agreed multiple times to coffee, lunch, etc. outside the gym
* After one of our hangouts she posted “Made my day ☺️” on IG Notes
* Today she told me her husband “found my Instagram” (not sure if it’s true)
* She tells me about their daily arguments and what he says to her
* She seems comfortable opening up only with me

But today threw me off:

### **She didn’t hug me at all today.**

No greeting hug, no goodbye hug.
She shook my hand at the end.

She was venting heavily about her husband, seemed stressed, almost emotionally drained. It didn’t feel like she was excited to see me today.

This is the FIRST time her energy was flat.

---

# **My question for body-language people:**

### **Is her behavior toward me (especially the body language) showing she wants me to escalate physically?**

or…

### **Is she just trying to maintain an emotional connection and keep me around as emotional comfort?**

I don’t want a relationship with her — I’m not trying to break up a marriage.
I genuinely just like the attention and the gym vibe.

But the inconsistencies in her *home-life story* + her *reserved personality* + her *openness only toward me* make it hard to read her intentions.

---

# **Bonus confusion today:**

She mentioned:

* Husband found my IG
* Husband begs her every day to work things out
* She says she’s moving out soon
* She didn’t hug me today at all

Is this her pulling back because she’s scared?
Or is she just overwhelmed?
Or was she never actually attracted in the first place?

Just trying to interpret her **body language**, not judge the marriage.

---

**What does this behavior usually mean?
Have you seen this pattern before?**

So, I started texting her because we were mutuals and I wanted to be her friend. The reason I started texting her was because she reminded me of this one girl I used to be friends with (We’ll call this girl Jelly Bean.) The reason me and Jelly Bean stopped being friends was because she dropped me, and I was very hurt by it because I got attached to her quickly, so I missed her very deeply. So, that’s the reason why I started being friends with Melon because she reminded me of Jelly Bean. 

Later on, I realized that Melon was actually best friends with Jelly Bean, and I was shocked but I never told Melon anything about Jelly Bean or what she did to me. Fast forward a few months later, Jelly Bean drops Melon and I tell Melon what happened with me and Jelly Bean because I still didn’t tell Melon at that point of time. Melon already knew that I was friends with Jelly Bean because Jelly Bean told her. I tried my best to comfort Melon because Melon was very upset that Jelly Bean dropped her. At this time, I was very attached to Melon, I really admired her. I have problems with me getting attached too quickly. So after Jelly Bean drops Melon, Melon starts being friends with this girl named Vanilla (Not her real name.) I didn’t know at the time, but Melon liked Vanilla and one day, Melon texts me and she is like “The girl I like likes me back!”, and I was really upset since I was kind of interested into Melon at the time, and plus she only knew Vanilla for barely a month, so I was kind of annoyed because before Melon and Vanilla started dating, Melon would kind of pick Vanilla over me and I knew Melon longer than she knew Vanilla. I understand that I shouldn’t be jealous, but it’s so annoying whenever you try so hard for someone and they pick someone else. As well, even when they were friends, Melon would always post cute videos for Vanilla and she never would post me. She only really posted 2 videos for me and a million for Vanilla. I made videos for Melon tho, and I posted her like 5 times. I know that may not seem important, but if you can’t even post me but you can post someone you haven’t known for a long period of time, I’m obviously going to be upset. 

Okay so basically after Jelly Bean dropped Melon, Melon starts being friends with Coffee (not her real name), and Coffee and Jelly Bean were BEST FRIENDS. But Jelly Bean dropped Coffee, so Melon decides to be friends with Coffee, and mind you they start texting for one day and Melon starts posting Coffee even though she knew her for one day, yet she can’t even post me? Anyways, so later on Melon and Jelly Bean start being friends again because Melon wrote her this long paragraph about how she misses her and wants to be her friend again. So they start being friends again, but Melon feels guilty because she doesn’t know how Coffee will react and that she feels bad for Coffee and “me”, but I don’t think she even felt bad for me. I think she only felt bad for Coffee and what would Coffee think.

Anyways, one day, Coffee pretended to make a fake account to talk to Jelly Bean because she really misses Jelly Bean and Coffee was posting about talking to Jelly Bean on her story. So, Melon decides to tell Jelly Bean that Coffee is texting Jelly Bean on a fake account, which is honestly kind of makes me think that Melon is telling Jelly Bean what I said about her. I don’t want Jelly Bean to have any information about me. Also, I would say specifically “DO NOT TALK ABOUT JELLY BEAN WITH ME.” And yet, Melon would still tell me about Jelly Bean, and she says “I know you don’t want to hear about Jelly Bean but…” and it is actually so annoying. Another reason why I want to drop Melon is because she is friends with Jelly Bean, and I’ve been trying to move on and forget about Jelly Bean but Melon being friends with Jelly Bean is a daily reminder of what I lost. 

Back to Vanilla, so when Vanilla and Melon were dating Melon would get very jealous because Vanilla had this one friend that she would post a lot. Melon would say that Vanilla was trying to jealous bait her so Melon decided to use me to make Vanilla jealous, which I don’t really know how to feel about that, but eventually they broke up. Melon would never stop talking about Vanilla and at that time I was going through alot and I would still try my best to comfort Melon, but eventually it got tiring because it would always be about Vanilla. As well, I would tell her about my problems but I feel like she would say “ohh im so sorry” and then go back to start talking about Vanilla which is annoying, I understand I should be more understanding because she did loose her girlfriend but I just feel as if she doesn’t care about me. 

Fast forward a bit, we aren’t as close and the only time she texts me is when I text first. We were matching too, but then she unmatched with me and a few days later she legit started to match with someone else, and she made a highlight for someone. Mind you, she never even made a highlight for me, which kinda upsets me. I just started ghosting her now because she wouldn’t answer me even when she was online and I was done. 

Anyways, what do I do? I just feel like she doesn’t appreciate me enough, and I know she is online but I don’t really care about that. I just want to know what to do, I don’t want to drop her because I will feel bad, and I feel like I will miss her too much because im attached (though, I’m not that attached to her), but if I tell her how I feel, I feel like it will just damage our friendship. Sorry if stuff doesn’t make sense, if nothing makes sense, just tell me and I will clear it up. Just someone please give me advice, I don’t really know what im doing since this is my first time using Reddit. Thank you for reading!

No one warned me that zofran puts a complete stop to your digestive system. Miralax? A small cup of black coffee? Ice cream (lactose intolerant baddies will get it)?

Forget about it, it’s not happening. 

Zero action on aisle booty.

It has been well over a week since I’ve passed a bowel movement. I finally got prescribed reglan instead of zofran because zofran wasn’t touching my vomiting anyways—and now I’m scared to even take reglan because some people say it makes them poop. And y’all know the desperation of escaping the cycle of nausea. I have milk of magnesia with my name on it collecting dust on my bathroom counter (to be fair, I am so dehydrated that taking a laxative feels like playing roulette with my own colon. If I can’t keep down water how am I supposed to survive *this*??)

Anyways. Here I am. Staring at two medications I know will make me go. I have the pressure of a giants foot on my lower back because I know I need to. But my toes are literally going numb in terror at the thought of it.

I (28M, single) have been in what feels like an emotional affair with a married woman (35F) since around August. Before anyone jumps on me — yes, I know this is messy. I’m not proud of it. But I need advice on what the *realistic* outcome is if I go for a kiss tomorrow, because this situation has gone on way too long and I feel completely stuck.

We met at the gym and started talking casually. Over time she became extremely open with me. She told me early on she was married, but later said she was “separated” and “done with him,” but still living in the same house. When we first met, she called him husband, then 3rd or 4th interaction she was telling me she wants to leave him and starting calling him ex , other days “my daughter’s dad.” It changes based on who she’s talking to, which confuses me.

Since then we’ve had:

**• regular gym sessions together**
**• long coffee meetups at Panera/Starbucks/Dunkin**
**• deep personal conversations about her marriage, stress, moving out**
**• phone calls on holidays (she called me on Thanksgiving)**
**• hours-long emotional talks**

She rushes to see me, shows up out of breath, parks illegally just to make it on time. She likes everything I post on social media. She’s always warm with me, joking, sharing personal things, and she’s comfortable around me in sweatpants/no makeup.

A few weeks ago she admitted she used to have a crush on a guy from the gym but it fizzled out. She also posted two quotes recently:

1. “You didn’t give me mixed signals, I just collected what I wanted to see.”
2. “I’m tired of putting myself out there.”

Which she posted literally hours before going out with her family. She also “liked” the quote I posted last night that said “Some people stay on your mind more than they should.”

My friend is telling me she’s “begging” for me to make a move. I’m not sure.

**The big question:**
Tomorrow we’re meeting at the gym again, and possibly grabbing coffee after. I’m wondering if I should just end this emotional limbo and go for a kiss becuase idk what she wants from all this and continuously lying to me that shes moving

Part of me feels like she wants something…
Part of me feels like she would panic and shut down.
Part of me feels like I’ve already been pulled in too deep.

**For context:**
• She’s 35
• I’m 28
• I’m single
• She’s still married but allegedly “leaving” , shes been telling me since that since august. I never believed she was ever leaving her husband when she first told me 
• This emotional attachment has been going on for months
• She’s very reserved normally, but opens up deeply to me
• She has NEVER followed through on plans that involve true privacy
• She DID rush to see me today even when she was running late

**My questions for Reddit:**

1. Do I actually have the lead here?
2. Would a kiss make her freak out because of guilt?
3. Is she waiting for me to step up — or is she emotionally using me?
4. What is the *likely* outcome if I go for a kiss tomorrow?
5. Should I be the one to break this dynamic, or am I misreading everything?

I’m looking for honest feedback from people who have been on either side of situations like this. I’m trying to understand whether she wants something physical or if I’m just her emotional escape from a bad marriage.

No hate — I already know this whole thing is complicated. I just need clarity before this drags on even longer.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

So a few weeks ago, I was walking to the train station, I look to my left and there is an absolutely gorgeous girl looking at me, we make eye contact for like a second and the train comes in between. That’s some smut novel stuff right there had my heart fluttering for days. I accept it and move on.

A week goes by, sitting at the station, train comes up, before it goes by I see her round the corner on the other side of the tracks.

Fast forward to today, I’m downtown on my lunch break joining my friends for coffee (I don’t drink coffee so I’ll tag along) we round the corner to the coffee shop, I look behind the counter and there she is looking at me while helping a customer.

Feeling like a complete idiot because I didn’t speak to her when she was right there, but in my defense:

1. She’s at work, and has a job to do
2. I don’t drink coffee
3. I’m mid conversation with my friends
4. My legs had been reduced to jelly, my face was burning, heart fluttery, etc. etc.

The worst part is, under all other circumstances I stay pretty cool, but the moment I’m eye to eye with someone that genuinely sets my brain on fire I melt. I haven’t really had much practice, this has happened like twice in my life.

Now I’m home wondering wtf I can do to at least ask her out. Showing up to her work feels kinda wrong, she has no choice, plus, I don’t drink coffee so what do I just start now? Do I collect enough coffee knowledge and go back once I’m worthy and can work the espresso machine?

In the case that it works out, I get a date, I don’t want to start things off on false pretenses. On the inverse, I want a date.

Let’s see if this helps at all. 

Heaven Hill GTG Wheated Bourbon, Chinqupin Oak
Age: 7 years
Proof: 105°
Mash bill: 52c / 35w / 13 mb

Nose: baking spice, toasted pecans, touch of coffee and cherry syrup, little to no ethanol - 3/5, Decent

Palate: first sip is a little oaky up front that gives way to a chocolatey crème brûlée thing. Following sips give more of the expected Old Fitz/Larceny wheatiness, reminding me of honey wheat bread - 3/5, Decent

Finish: finish lingers for awhile and it’s mostly sweet. More of that cherry and vanilla hangout, almost like a slice of honey wheat toast with whipped cream and a fruit drizzle. Nothing special, but it’s pleasant and not too bitter or tannic - 3/5, Decent

I’m not really upset by this pour. It’s pleasant and easy to drink, offering some complexity in flavor if you really wanted to think about it and dig deep. Am I gonna dish out $130+tax for a bottle? Absolutely not. This is a slightly more elevated and complex version of the Old Fitz 7yr BiB for almost 2.5x the price (I rated the OF7 a 2.65/5 on my personal scale), with the choice of oak definitely having a flavor impact. I think the GTG is really cool concept and it’s interesting to see heritage/legacy distillers take it up, but it’s not really justifiable price wise for the consumer, in my opinion.",11,1764726924.0,bourbon,3,1.0,False

1pcrdzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pcrdzh/why_i_ended_up_loving_austria_specifically/,Why I ended up loving Austria (specifically Western Austria) more than I expected,"I'm an American and have been lucky enough to spend time in the Alps in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and Austria – and honestly? Austria has become my favorite country.  
  
Western Austria somehow connected with me more than any other Alpine region:  
  
It has the beauty of the Swiss Alps... without the elitism. I was in Switzerland, and while it is breathtaking, it sometimes feels like an exclusive showroom for billionaires, oligarchs, and discreet private clients.  
  
But Austria? It was just as impressive, but it felt authentic and not staged. Even in the more upscale places like Kitzbühel or Seefeld, I didn't feel out of place. Of course, there is wealth, but it does not dominate the atmosphere. You see families, skiers, hikers, retirees, farmers, students – and they all fit together perfectly.  
  
2. It is incredibly warm and human. I can't emphasize it enough: The people made the difference.  
  
In Tyrol and in Salzburg, I met:  
  
Farmers who smiled at us and joked with us; Locals who were genuinely curious about where we came from; waiters and bartenders who were straightforward but friendly; Families who welcomed us with open arms. Mountain huts felt like an extension of the living room.  
  
It felt connected. Less formal, less reserved, less businesslike than in Switzerland.  
  
It simply has this mix of Central European order, Italian zest for life, and Alpine warmth.  
  
3. It creates the perfect balance between outdoor activities and everyday life.  
  
I only truly learned to appreciate that when I left, because I come from Atlanta in the southeastern USA, which is beautiful in its own way, but can never compare to Europe.  
  
Austria is one of the few places where:  
  
Skiing for me as a skier is normal and not glamorous; Hiking trails start right in the village and are not kilometers away; lakes are there for swimming and not just admired from afar; Mountains are part of everyday life and not just a tourist attraction.  
  
Innsbruck particularly impressed me. It felt like Boulder, Colorado, or Asheville, North Carolina in the States but right in the Alps, but with:  
  
comparatively better food; better infrastructure; more history; more culture; a very special atmosphere. It is a university town amidst breathtaking nature. The perfect balance.  
  
4. It is expensive, but it never comes across as ostentatious.  
  
It's definitely not cheap, but by no means as bad as I expected.  
I feel like you're paying for quality here, not for brands. Compared to Switzerland, where I would rather burn my wallet for a coffee, Austria seemed... strangely reasonable.  
  
5. It is a place where I can honestly imagine living, not just visiting.  
  
This is the most important point for me.  
  
Some Alpine places are indeed incredibly beautiful to look at, but you can only live there if you are a millionaire.  
  
But if I had a job working from home, I would honestly love to rent a small apartment in Innsbruck or St. Johann im Pongau, go hiking, play golf, and ski on the weekends, learn the language, and really feel like part of the community.  
  
Honestly, compared to the USA, it's just a completely different feeling.  
  
6. It is nice to be staged without beauty.  
Unlike the Swiss, I had the impression that the Austrians do not see the Alps – apart from perhaps Kitzbühel or Zell am See – as a luxury brand. They see it as their home.  
  
For me, Austria had:  
  
Beauty at Swiss level  
  
Bavarian warmth  
  
Slovenian Serenity  
  
German efficiency  
  
Authentic culture  
  
Authentic people. A place I absolutely want to visit on my next trip is Lake Wörthersee! Or Spielberg for the Austrian Grand Prix.  
  
I love Austria.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

Booked 3.5 months out for a Wednesday in shoulder season. They were already booked for the rest of the week. The restaurant is part of Hotel Traube Tonbach, a long-running Black Forest destination hotel (with 3 Michelin Keys) where guests have been coming for decades to spend all day at the hotel’s spa/baths/saunas/steam rooms. Some also choose to hike. While the hotel clearly was not used to having many english-speaking guests, the restaurant had no issues.

One of the restaurant’s strengths is its flexibility. While they offer three set menus plus an à la carte selection, diners can freely mix and match. We took Menu I, removed the opening course, and replaced it with two courses from Menu II—no fuss, totally accommodating.

**Amuse-Bouche:** A farro risotto in cold consommé with kefir yogurt, green Chartreuse sorbet, and crisp vegetables. Fresh, lively, palate-cleansing.

**First course:** Poached oysters and caviar. Oysters were under an obscene amount of caviar, and anchored by a champagne beurre blanc with tart green apples. Very harmonious.

**Second course:** Charcoal-grilled lobster paired with sautéed and crispy mushrooms, scallions, and a savory dusting that tied it all together. Rich and smoky.

**Third course:** Stuffed red mullet with crispy fish scales, peanuts, pickled cucumbers, alliums, and a chili-prawn vinaigrette with coconut cream. Bright, zippy, and boldly Asian. Very nicely executed.

**Final savory course:** Black Forest roe deer. Gratinated medallion and braised shoulder with glazed pineapple, chanterelles, and a Rouennaise accented with coffee and passion fruit. Good, though the least thrilling dish of the evening.

Obligatory cheese trolley that I neglected to take a photo of. Most of the cheese came from France, however.

**Dessert:** Just one dessert course, thank god! Tarte Tatin. No commentary. 

**Petite Fours:** Wide selection, brought tableside. Opted for two caneles. Very nicely done. 

**Service:** Polished, warm, friendly. The elderly hotel owner made the rounds personally. Clearly very proud of his hotel and restaurant. The chef was present, but remained in the kitchen aside from regular tableside service at one table — a solo 60-year-old man. 

**Final Thoughts:** Excellent wine list. My favorite aspect of the restaurant is the size of coursing. This is not a place you should go if you want endless small courses. Here, the plates are substantial and purposeful. They are operating at the top of their game. It was a destination meal in every sense.",39,1764726382.0,finedining,3,0.99,False

I’m a school therapist, and I’m trying to figure out what to do over the summer. I don’t make enough money during the school year to take those 2.5 months off but I would love to take that break because the school year burns me out because I have such a high caseload. I only have my limited license right now 

Last summer I worked four days a week, covering at school sites of therapists who didn’t want to work summers but had students who wanted services over the summer. It was hard to even get 32 hours, I really had to push to work 4 days instead of 3. It was tough to go to a new site each day, and even harder to connect with clients only for 10ish weeks. A lot of them don’t show up over the summers either, especially when mid July hits. It became disheartening and very boring!

I’ve thought about getting a low pressure retail job or maybe being a coffee barista or working at a dog daycare, but then I’d have to work 5-6 days a week just to make enough money, because I’d be getting paid minimum wage

But I have a master’s degree and want to be getting paid what I’m worth! Also who would only hire me for 2.5 months? I feel like it would be over by the time I finish training/get the hang of things 😵

The manager, Chad Bruder, rotated on his swivel chair to look at Mike. He didn't say anything. Mike Wills walked in and sat down on a chair across from Chad Bruder's desk. “So, uh, Chad—Mr Bruder—sir, I’ve been thinking, which I hope you don't mind, but I've been thinking about the work I do for the company, and how much I'm paid. As you know, I have two kids, a third on the way, and, sir, if you'll let me be frank…”

Chad Bruder listened without speaking. Not a single *mhm* or head nod. Even his breathing was controlled, professionally imperceptible. Only his eyes moved, focussing on Mike Wills’ face, then slowly drifting away—before returning with a sudden jump, as if they were a typewriter. Chad Bruder didn't open his mouth or lick his lips. He didn't even blink. His gaze was razorlike. His palms, resting on the armrests of his office chair, upturned as if he were meditating.

Mike Wills kept talking, increasingly in circles, tripping over his words, starting to sweat, misremembering his argument, messing up its expression until, unable to take the tension anymore, he abruptly finished by thanking Chad Bruder for his time and going off script: “Actually, I see it now. The company really does pay me what I'm worth. That's what it's about. It's not about, uh, how much I need but how valuable I am to the company. There are others more valuable, and they get paid more, and if—if I want to make as much as they do, which I don't—at the moment, I don't—I need to work as much and as well as they do. Even the fact I have kids, that's a liability. It's a selfish choice. I understand that, Mr Bruder, sir.” He was fishing for a reaction: something, but Chad Bruder was not forthcoming. His drifting eyes carriage returned. Mike Wills went on, “So, I guess I came here to ask for a raise, but what I've gotten from you is infinitely more valuable: knowledge, a better, less emotional, more mature perspective on the world and my own self-worth and place in it. I'm grateful for that. Grateful that you let me talk it out. No judgement. No anger. You're a patient man, Mr Gruder, sir. And an excellent manager. Thank you. Thank you!” And, with that, Mike Wills stood up, bowed awkwardly while backing away towards the door, and left Chad Bruder's office to return to his cubicle.

Chad Bruder rotated on his swivel chair to look at his computer screen. Spreadsheets were on it. On the desk, beside the computer, sat a plastic box filled with assorted nuts. Chad Bruder lifted an arm, lowered it over the box, closed his hands on a selection of the nuts and lifted those to his mouth. These he swallowed without chewing.

The clock read 1:15 p.m.

The Accumulus Corporation building thrummed with money-making.

In a boardroom:

“Bruder?” an executive said. “Why, he's one of our finest men. His teams always excel in productivity. He's a very capable middle-manager.”

“But does he ever, you know: talk?”

The executive dropped his voice. “Listen, just between the two of us, he was a diversity hire. Disability, and not the visible kind. He's obviously not a Grade-A Retard, with the eyes and the *arf-arf-arf*’ing. As far as I know, no one really does know what’s ‘wrong’ with him. Not that anything *is* ‘wrong.’ He's just different—in some way—that no one’s privy to know. But he is a fully capable and dignified individual, and Accumulus supports him in all his endeavours.”

“I guess I just find him creepy, that's all,” said the other executive, whose name was Randall. “I'm sure he's fine at his job. I have no reason to doubt his dedication or capabilities. It's just, you know, his interpersonal skills…”

“So you would oppose his promotion?” asked the first executive, raising a greying and bushy, well-rehearsed right eyebrow.

“Oh, no—God, no! Not in the least,” said Randall.

“Good.”

“These are just my own, personal observations. We need someone we can work with.”

“He'll play ball,” said the first executive. “Besides, if not him, then who: a woman?” They both laughed uproariously at this. “At least Bruder knows the code. He'll be an old boy soon enough.”

“Very well,” said Randall.

“But, you do understand, I'll have to write you up for this,” said the first executive.

“For?”

“Expression of a prejudiced opinion. Nothing serious, just a formality, really; but it must be done. It may even be good for your career in the long run. You own the mistake, demonstrate personal growth. Learning opportunity, as they say. Take your penance and move on, with a nice, concrete example of a time you bettered yourself in your pocket to pull out at the next interview.”

“Thank you,” said Randall.

“Don't mention it. Friends look out for each other,” said the first executive.

“Actually, I think I'll report you, too.”

“Great. What for?”

“Nepotism. Handing out write-ups based on a criteria other than merit.”

“Oh, that's a good one. I don't think I've had one of those before. That will look very good in my file. It may even push me over the edge next time. Fingers respectfully crossed. Every dog has his day.”

“I love to help,” said Randall.

_____

To satiate his curiosity about Chad Bruder, Randall began a small info-gathering campaign. No one who currently worked—or had worked—under Bruder was willing (or able) to say anything at all about the man, but, as always, there were rumours: that Chad had been born without a larynx, that he came from a country (no one knew which) whose diet was almost exclusively nut-based, that he wasn't actually physically impaired and his silence was voluntary, that he worked a part-time job as a monk concurrently with his job for Accumulus Corporation, that he had no wife and children, that he had a wife and two children, that he had two wives and one child, that he had a husband, a common-law wife and three children, all of whom were adopted, and so on.

_____

At 5:00 p.m., Chad Bruder got up from his desk, exited his office and took the elevator down to the lobby. In the lobby, he took an exceedingly long drink from a water fountain. He went into a bathroom, and after about a quarter of an hour came out. He then walked to a small, organic grocery store, where the staff all knew him and always had his purchase—a box of mixed nuts—ready. They charged his credit card. He walked stiffly but with purpose. His face remained expressionless. Only his typewriter-eyes moved. Holding his nuts, he walked straight home.

_____

“Well, *I* happen to think he's kinda sexy,” said Darla, one of the numerous secretaries who worked in the Accumulus Corporation building. “Strong silent type, you know? And that salary!”

“What about that other guy, Randall?” asked her friend.

They were having coffee.

“Randall is a complete and total nerd. You may as well ask me why I don't wanna date Mike Wills.”

“Eww! Now that one's a real jellyfish!”

“And married!”

“Really? I always thought he was just making that up—you know, to seem normal. The kids, too.”

“Oh? Maybe he is.”

“That's what I think because, like, what kind of sponge would marry him? Plus he keeps talking about his family: how much he loves his wife, how great his kids are. I mean, who does that? Like, if you don't have anything interesting to say, just shut the fuck up.”

“Like Chad Bruder,” said Darla.

“Ohmygod, you slut—you really *do* have a thing for him, don't you?”

Darla blushed. (It was a skill she'd spent hours practicing in front of the mirror, with visible results.) “Stop! OK? He just seems like a real man. That's rare these days. Plus he's got that wild, animal magnetism.”

_____

Randall was at a dead end—*multiple* dead ends, in fact. (And a few in pure conjecture, too.) There was almost nothing substantive about Chad Bruder in the employment file. HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation. Sorry.”

_____

“I swear, he looks at me like I'm a freakin’ spreadsheet—*and I fucking love it*,” Darla told her friend. “I've made sure to walk past his office over and over, and if he looks up, it's with those penetrating, slightly lazy eyes of his. Chestnut brown. No change of expression whatsoever. It's like he has no interest in me at all. God, that makes me so hot.”

“Have you talked to him?”

Darla gave her a look. “Right,” said her friend: “He doesn't do that: talk.”

“So what do I do?”

“Well, maybe he's gay or something. You ever thought of that? It would explain a lot.”

“He is *not* gay. Don't even say that!”

“If you're so sure, then he's obviously just playing hard to get, so what you gotta do is: play harder. Just be careful. Don't risk your job. Office dating is a minefield. You probably have a policy about it.”

“Screw the job. I can be a secretary anywhere. Besides, if we end up together, I won't even need to work. It's an open secret he's about to be promoted. *Executive* position, which comes with *executive* pay and *executive* benefits. Hey,” she asked suddenly, “do you think maybe my tits are too small—is that the problem?”

“Honey, what matters is what *he* thinks. And to have an opinion, he's gotta see the goods.”

_____

Chad Bruder was sitting in his office, behind his desk, looking at a spreadsheet when Darla walked in. She was wearing a tight dress and carrying a card. “Morning, sir,” she said, striking a pose. Then she bent slowly forward, giving him a good view of her cleavage, before righting herself, fluttering her eyelashes and fixing her hair. She punctuated the performance with a subtle but evident *purr.*

The *purr* seemed to get Chad Bruder's attention, because it was if his body somehow rearranged, like a wave had passed through it. Darla smiled, bit her lower lip (painted the most garish shade of red imaginable) and placed the card she'd been holding on Chad Bruder's desk. Written on it, beside a lipstick stained kiss, was an address: hers. “If you're ever feeling lonely, or in the mood, or whatever,” she said seductively. “You can always call on me.”

She turned and, swinging her hips like she was the pendulum on an antique grandfather clock, sashayed out the door, into the hall, feeling so excited she almost swooned.

Chad Bruder looked at the card. He swallowed some mixed nuts. He called a committee, and the committee made a majority decision.

He tremored.

_____


Randall loitered in the Accumulus building lobby until Chad Bruder came down punctually in the elevator. He watched Chad Bruder drink water and waited while Chad Bruder spent fifteen minutes in the bathroom. Then, pulling on a baseball cap and an old vinyl windbreaker, he followed Chad Bruder out the doors. On the streets of Maninatinhat he kept what he felt was a safe distance. When Chad Bruder entered a grocery store, Randall leaned against a wall and chewed gum. When Chad Bruder came out holding a box of nuts, Randall followed him all the way home.

It turned out that hine was a long way from Maninatinhat, in a shabby apartment building all the way over in Rooklyn. (Not even Booklyn.) The walk was long, but Chad Bruder never slowed, which led Randall to conclude that despite whatever disability he had, Chad Bruder was in peak physical condition. Still, it was a little odd he hadn't taken a taxi, or public transit, thought Randall. And the building itself was well below what should have been Chad Bruder's standard. For a moment, Randall entertained the thought that the “foreign transplant” theory was correct and that Chad Bruder was working to support a large family overseas: working and saving so his loved ones had enough to eat, maybe a luxury, like chocolate or Coca Cola, once in a while. Then his natural cynicism chewed that theory up and spat it out.

When Chad Bruder entered the building, Randall stayed temporarily outside, across the street—before rushing in just in time to see the floor indicator above the elevator change. The elevator stopped on the fourth floor. He didn't know what unit Chad Bruder lived in yet, but he would find out. He had no doubt that he would find out more than anyone had ever known about Chad Bruder.

Excited, Randall exited the building and walked conspiratorially around its perimeter. The fourth floor was about level with some trees that were growing in what passed for the property’s communal green space. There was a rusted old playground, and black squirrels squeaked and barked and chased one another all around the trees and playground equipment, and even onto the building's jutting balconies. Randall knew he would never want to live here.

_____

It was late on a Saturday evening when the doorbell to Darla's apartment rang, and when she looked through the peephole in her door she saw it was Chad Bruder.

Her heart nearly went off-beat.

He was dressed in his office clothes, but Darla knew he often worked weekends, so that wasn't strange. More importantly, she didn't care. He must have been thinking about her all day. She fixed her breasts, quickly arranged her hair in the mirror and opened the apartment door, feigning total yet romantically welcome surprise. “Oh, Chad! I'm so—”

He pushed through her into the apartment (“Chad, wow—I'm…”) which she managed to turn into: her pulling him into her bedroom. Gosh, his hand feels *funny,* she thought. *Like a silk sock filled with noodles.* But then he was standing in the doorway, his shoulders so broad, his chestnut eyes so chestnut, and spreading her legs she invited him in. “I've been imagining this for a long, long time, Chad. Tell me—tell me you have too, if not with words, then—”

And he was on top of her.

*Yes,* she thought.

She closed her eyes and *purred* and his hand, caressing her neck, suddenly closed on it like a flesh-made vice. “Ch—ch… a—d,” she wheezed. Her eyes: still shut. She felt something cold and round and glass fall on her chest, roll down onto the mattress. She opened her eyes and Chad's gripping hand throttled her scream and he was missing an eye—one of his eyes was fucking gone, and in its place—in the gaping hole *where the eye should have been*, a squirrel was sticking its fucking head out, staring at her!

The squirrel squeezed through the hole and landed on her body, its little feet pitter-pattering across her bare, exposed skin, which crawled.

Another squirrel followed.

And another.

Until a dozen of them were out, were on and around her, and Chad Bruder's body was looking deflated, like an abandoned, human birthday balloon. But still he maintained his grip on her throat. She was trying to pry his fingers off. She managed it too—but before she could scream for help one of the squirrels that had emerged through Chad Bruder's empty eye socket crawled into her mouth. She was gagging. It was furry, moving. She threw up, but the squirrel was a living plug. The vomit sloshed around in her mouth, filling her. She started beating her hands against anything, everything: the bed, the squirrels, the rubbery husk that was Chad Bruder. She kicked out. She bit down. The squirrel in her mouth ***crunched,*** and she imagined breaking its little spine with her jaws, then bit her tongue. She tasted blood: hers and its. Now the other squirrels started scratching, attacking, biting her too, ripping tiny chunks of her flesh and eating it, morsel by morsel. The squirrel in her mouth was dead but she couldn't force it out. She was hyperventilating. She was having a panic attack. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't defend herself. There was less and less of her, and more and more squirrels, which ran madly around the bedroom, and she was dizzy, and she was hurting, and they were stabbing her with their sharp, nasty little teeth. Then a couple of them tore open her stomach and burrowed inside. She could feel them moving within her. And see them: small, roving distensions. They were eating her organs. Gnawing at her tendons. Until, finally, she was dead.

When the deed was done and the cat-woman killed and cleaned almost to the bone, the committee reconvened and assessed the situation. “Good meat,” one squirrel said. “Yes, yes,” said another. “The threat is ended.” “We should expand our diet.” “Meat, meat, meat.” “What to do with remains?” “Deposit in Central Dark.” “Yes, yes.” “Is the man-suit damaged?” “No visible damage.” “Excellent.” “Yes, yes.” “Shift change?” “Home.” “Yes, yes.”

The squirrels re-entered Chad Bruder, disposed of their single fallen comrade, and walked purposefully home to Chad Bruder's apartment.

“Shit,” cursed Randall.

He hadn't expected Chad Bruder back so soon. He tried to think of an excuse—any excuse—to allow him to get the fuck out of here, so he could show the photos and videos he'd taken of Chad Bruder's bizarre living conditions. The lack of any food but nuts. The dirt all over the floors. The complete lack of furniture. The scratches all over the walls. The door was open:* that was it!* The door was open so he'd walked in, just to see if everyone was all right. Chad Bruder probably wouldn't recognize him. A lot of people worked for Accumulus Corporation, and the executives were a bit of an Olympus from the rest. He would pretend to be a maintenance worker, *a concerned neighbour who heard something happening inside.* “Oh, hello—sorry, sorry: didn't mean to scare you,” he said as soon as Chad Bruder walked through the door. But Chad Bruder didn't look scared. He didn't look anything. “I was, uh, investigating a water leak. I'm a plumber, you see. Building management called me, and I heard some strange sounds coming from inside this unit. I thought, it must be the leak, so I, well, saw the door was open, knocked, of course, but there was no answer, so I just popped in to have a look. But, uh, looks like you, the owner, are home now, so I'll be going—”

Suffice it to say, Randall never stood a chance. He fought, even rather valiantly for a nerd, but in the end they overpowered him and had a bloody and merry feast, even letting their friends in through the balcony to partake of his raw, fresh human. Then they had shift change, and in the morning the new squirrel team went in to work as Chad Bruder.

_____

“Awful what happened, eh?” A few people were gathered around a water cooler on the tenth floor of the Accumulus building.

“I heard they found both of them in Central Dark.”

“What remained of them…”

“Chewed up by wild animals. So bad they had to use their teeth to identify them.”

“Awful.”

“One hundred percent. A tragedy. So, how do you think they died?”

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

Chad Bruder was holding a printed sheet of paper.

He held it out.

One of the water cooler people took it. The rest moved closer to look at it. The paper said, in printed capital letters: THEY WERE HAVING AFFAIR. HE KILLED HER SHOT SELF. IF AGREE PLEASE SMILE.

Everyone smiled, and, for the first time anyone could remember, Chad Bruder smiled too.

“He's going to make a fine executive,” one of the water cooler people said once Chad Bruder had left. “His theory makes a lot of sense too.” “I didn't even know either of them was married.” “Me neither.” “Just goes to show you how you never really know anyone.” “The lengths some people will go to, eh?” “Disgusting.” “Reprehensible.” “Say, weren't there supposed to be free donuts in the lunchroom today?” “Oh, right!”

_____

On the day Chad Bruder was officially promoted from middle-manager to Junior Executive, Mike Wills leapt to his death from the top floor of the Accumulus building. His wife had declared she was divorcing him and taking their kids to Lost Angeles to live with her mother. “I just can't live with a jellyfish like you,” she’d told him.

Sadly, Mike Wills’ act of quiet desperation was altogether too quiet, for he had jumped inopportunely, coincident with Chad Bruder's celebratory lunch, which meant nobody saw him fall. Moreover, he landed on a pile of old mattresses—the soiled by-products of a recent Executives Party—that had been left out for the garbage collectors to pick up. But the garbage collectors were on strike, so no one picked them up for two weeks. The mattresses, which had dampened the sound of Mike Wills’ impact, had also initially saved his life. However, his body was badly broken by the fall, and at some point between that day and the day the garbage *was* collected, he expired. Voiceless and in agony. When it came time to identify the body, nobody could quite remember his name or if he had even worked there. When the police finally reached his estranged wife with the news, she told them she couldn't talk because she'd taken up surfing.",1,1764726138.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False
1pcr5gd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pcr5gd/uninvited_wedding_guest_fundamentally_disrupts_my/,"Uninvited wedding guest fundamentally disrupts my partnership, long before an April wedding and continuing 7 months after.","There's so much context but I'm trying to keep it simple. 
My (42m) wife (44f) and I invited a friend she hadn't seen in person in 14 years, to join us at Burning Man to celebrate our partnership. Smash cut to this person taking it upon themselves to book travel accommodations without asking and we'll before a venue was chosen, and on top of that, before I sent an email to the family that was a big deal for me (again, so much context).

I'll spare the details but we fought for months leading up to the wedding and, even after I very cleary told this person their inflexible plans do not work for us and implored her to acknowledge me. She did not. My partner did not hold her to answering me. This led to this person completely fucking shit up the day she arrived and every day, including our wedding, until the day she left. 

We continued to go round and round about this person, until we stopped. Then things got remarkably better between us, like it was before this person became part of anything. A couple weeks ago I realized what precipitated that change: I let loose on this person via what's app and absolutely destroyed them, and I do not regret anything I said. Problem is, I mentioned that realization to my wife and, oh boy, did it all come crashing down. 

But first: the destruction. 

""What's it like being the worst piece of scum to ever exist? I despise that you exist. Do not ever contact xxx again. You're a disgusting piece of shit. You wear Disney clothes as an adult. Fuck you and the Nazi family you came from. I fucking hate you, you ruined an event you weren't invited to. You serve no purpose in this world, which is of course why you stole an education from a native citizen to end up like, well, you have. I hope you get run over by a bus like your entitled trash family member that was unable to use words like a real person. Enjoy your goats you middle of nowhere cunt, you will never be loved. By anyone, ever."" 

We both have had people treat us as less than and neither of us ever got the opportunity to give people what they deserved to their face. 
The wedding was on 26 April and the message was sent 22 Sept. Clearly, I despise this person. 


So then, AITAH for reacting to my life partner making a point to wish this person a happy birthday as we traveled back from an emotionally intense and delightfully significant family trip that was preceeded by her drunkenly shoving me onto our coffee table (breaking it and bruising the shit out of my ass. Not literally of course) and putting a mark on my body that if it were reversed, I'd still be in jail two weeks later. We've been through hell, and immediately after the worst yet, we worked it out and fucking knocked the weekend out of the park. 

She didn't offer up that she reached out. I admitted seeing this person's name as she looked at her phone. Everyone got them peripherals, she eyeballs my business just as much as anyone else. I'm the spirit of communication within the context of the convo, I brought up seeing a message from this person. Only then was it, oh I had wished her a happy birthday... 

AITAH here for taking exception to my life partner ignoring me when it came to this person definitely before the wedding but more importantly, after my verbal destruction after she assaulted me? 

Tldr; long lost friend invited themselves to a wedding in the US, traveling from Europe, just to end up fucking up our discourse months prior, then fucking up our wedding, and after getting verbally annihilated, my wife still is like ""hey happy birthday"" 

Happy to provide specifics. While the execution was assholish, I need outside opinions if I am indeed, the A hole here. ",2,1764726131.0,AITAH,22,0.75,False

I recently move to California from the upper Midwest, where I sometimes felt like the only bi woman on earth. It's was lonely and not great for my mental health.

A while back, a few of us in San Diego decided to post on Reddit, looking for other local bi women to hang out with. We didn't expect much—maybe a coffee date or two. But the response was honestly amazing (in the best way). Don't get me wrong - there's a huge LGBTQ+ community in our city, but not all spaces feel totally bi-friendly. To find bi sisters was HUGE!

And we quickly discovered there were so many other queer women wanting the same thing: a safe and friendly space to connect with people who just get it. We grew so quickly that we literally broke our group chats. Managing meetups and keeping track of new members became a challenge. So we took the plunge and built our own free community hub: [sdbigirls.com](https://sdbigirls.com/).

I’m sharing this to **inspire** and **connect**. If you’re out there wishing for a bi community in your area, go ahead and start one! Post a thread! There are definitely people waiting for someone to step up. Even if you only get a group chat going, it will be a chat with YOUR people. On our site we added a lot of Q&A, FAQ type content to help others who are just starting their journey. Resources like r/bisexual are ABSOLUTELY A LIFESAVER!

For any locals in San Diego who haven’t found us yet, we now have a home base to plan coffee meetup, hikes, and nights out with our new squad.

It makes me so happy to see our little online thread turn into real friendships. There’s community out there! 🩷💜💙",2,1764726128.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False
1pcr55d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pcr55d/hr_life_is_nuts_the_chad_bruder_story/,[HR] Life Is Nuts: The Chad Bruder Story,"Mike Wills knocked weakly on his manager’s office door. The manager, Chad Bruder, rotated on his swivel chair to look at Mike. He didn't say anything. Mike Wills walked in and sat down on a chair across from Chad Bruder's desk. “So, uh, Chad—Mr Bruder—sir, I’ve been thinking, which I hope you don't mind, but I've been thinking about the work I do for the company, and how much I'm paid. As you know, I have two kids, a third on the way, and, sir, if you'll let me be frank…”

Chad Bruder listened without speaking. Not a single *mhm* or head nod. Even his breathing was controlled, professionally imperceptible. Only his eyes moved, focussing on Mike Wills’ face, then slowly drifting away—before returning with a sudden jump, as if they were a typewriter. Chad Bruder didn't open his mouth or lick his lips. He didn't even blink. His gaze was razorlike. His palms, resting on the armrests of his office chair, upturned as if he were meditating.

Mike Wills kept talking, increasingly in circles, tripping over his words, starting to sweat, misremembering his argument, messing up its expression until, unable to take the tension anymore, he abruptly finished by thanking Chad Bruder for his time and going off script: “Actually, I see it now. The company really does pay me what I'm worth. That's what it's about. It's not about, uh, how much I need but how valuable I am to the company. There are others more valuable, and they get paid more, and if—if I want to make as much as they do, which I don't—at the moment, I don't—I need to work as much and as well as they do. Even the fact I have kids, that's a liability. It's a selfish choice. I understand that, Mr Bruder, sir.” He was fishing for a reaction: something, but Chad Bruder was not forthcoming. His drifting eyes carriage returned. Mike Wills went on, “So, I guess I came here to ask for a raise, but what I've gotten from you is infinitely more valuable: knowledge, a better, less emotional, more mature perspective on the world and my own self-worth and place in it. I'm grateful for that. Grateful that you let me talk it out. No judgement. No anger. You're a patient man, Mr Gruder, sir. And an excellent manager. Thank you. Thank you!” And, with that, Mike Wills stood up, bowed awkwardly while backing away towards the door, and left Chad Bruder's office to return to his cubicle.

Chad Bruder rotated on his swivel chair to look at his computer screen. Spreadsheets were on it. On the desk, beside the computer, sat a plastic box filled with assorted nuts. Chad Bruder lifted an arm, lowered it over the box, closed his hands on a selection of the nuts and lifted those to his mouth. These he swallowed without chewing.

The clock read 1:15 p.m.

The Accumulus Corporation building thrummed with money-making.

In a boardroom:

“Bruder?” an executive said. “Why, he's one of our finest men. His teams always excel in productivity. He's a very capable middle-manager.”

“But does he ever, you know: talk?”

The executive dropped his voice. “Listen, just between the two of us, he was a diversity hire. Disability, and not the visible kind. He's obviously not a Grade-A Retard, with the eyes and the *arf-arf-arf*’ing. As far as I know, no one really does know what’s ‘wrong’ with him. Not that anything *is* ‘wrong.’ He's just different—in some way—that no one’s privy to know. But he is a fully capable and dignified individual, and Accumulus supports him in all his endeavours.”

“I guess I just find him creepy, that's all,” said the other executive, whose name was Randall. “I'm sure he's fine at his job. I have no reason to doubt his dedication or capabilities. It's just, you know, his interpersonal skills…”

“So you would oppose his promotion?” asked the first executive, raising a greying and bushy, well-rehearsed right eyebrow.

“Oh, no—God, no! Not in the least,” said Randall.

“Good.”

“These are just my own, personal observations. We need someone we can work with.”

“He'll play ball,” said the first executive. “Besides, if not him, then who: a woman?” They both laughed uproariously at this. “At least Bruder knows the code. He'll be an old boy soon enough.”

“Very well,” said Randall.

“But, you do understand, I'll have to write you up for this,” said the first executive.

“For?”

“Expression of a prejudiced opinion. Nothing serious, just a formality, really; but it must be done. It may even be good for your career in the long run. You own the mistake, demonstrate personal growth. Learning opportunity, as they say. Take your penance and move on, with a nice, concrete example of a time you bettered yourself in your pocket to pull out at the next interview.”

“Thank you,” said Randall.

“Don't mention it. Friends look out for each other,” said the first executive.

“Actually, I think I'll report you, too.”

“Great. What for?”

“Nepotism. Handing out write-ups based on a criteria other than merit.”

“Oh, that's a good one. I don't think I've had one of those before. That will look very good in my file. It may even push me over the edge next time. Fingers respectfully crossed. Every dog has his day.”

“I love to help,” said Randall.

_____

To satiate his curiosity about Chad Bruder, Randall began a small info-gathering campaign. No one who currently worked—or had worked—under Bruder was willing (or able) to say anything at all about the man, but, as always, there were rumours: that Chad had been born without a larynx, that he came from a country (no one knew which) whose diet was almost exclusively nut-based, that he wasn't actually physically impaired and his silence was voluntary, that he worked a part-time job as a monk concurrently with his job for Accumulus Corporation, that he had no wife and children, that he had a wife and two children, that he had two wives and one child, that he had a husband, a common-law wife and three children, all of whom were adopted, and so on.

_____

At 5:00 p.m., Chad Bruder got up from his desk, exited his office and took the elevator down to the lobby. In the lobby, he took an exceedingly long drink from a water fountain. He went into a bathroom, and after about a quarter of an hour came out. He then walked to a small, organic grocery store, where the staff all knew him and always had his purchase—a box of mixed nuts—ready. They charged his credit card. He walked stiffly but with purpose. His face remained expressionless. Only his typewriter-eyes moved. Holding his nuts, he walked straight home.

_____

“Well, *I* happen to think he's kinda sexy,” said Darla, one of the numerous secretaries who worked in the Accumulus Corporation building. “Strong silent type, you know? And that salary!”

“What about that other guy, Randall?” asked her friend.

They were having coffee.

“Randall is a complete and total nerd. You may as well ask me why I don't wanna date Mike Wills.”

“Eww! Now that one's a real jellyfish!”

“And married!”

“Really? I always thought he was just making that up—you know, to seem normal. The kids, too.”

“Oh? Maybe he is.”

“That's what I think because, like, what kind of sponge would marry him? Plus he keeps talking about his family: how much he loves his wife, how great his kids are. I mean, who does that? Like, if you don't have anything interesting to say, just shut the fuck up.”

“Like Chad Bruder,” said Darla.

“Ohmygod, you slut—you really *do* have a thing for him, don't you?”

Darla blushed. (It was a skill she'd spent hours practicing in front of the mirror, with visible results.) “Stop! OK? He just seems like a real man. That's rare these days. Plus he's got that wild, animal magnetism.”

_____

Randall was at a dead end—*multiple* dead ends, in fact. (And a few in pure conjecture, too.) There was almost nothing substantive about Chad Bruder in the employment file. HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation. Sorry.”

_____

“I swear, he looks at me like I'm a freakin’ spreadsheet—*and I fucking love it*,” Darla told her friend. “I've made sure to walk past his office over and over, and if he looks up, it's with those penetrating, slightly lazy eyes of his. Chestnut brown. No change of expression whatsoever. It's like he has no interest in me at all. God, that makes me so hot.”

“Have you talked to him?”

Darla gave her a look. “Right,” said her friend: “He doesn't do that: talk.”

“So what do I do?”

“Well, maybe he's gay or something. You ever thought of that? It would explain a lot.”

“He is *not* gay. Don't even say that!”

“If you're so sure, then he's obviously just playing hard to get, so what you gotta do is: play harder. Just be careful. Don't risk your job. Office dating is a minefield. You probably have a policy about it.”

“Screw the job. I can be a secretary anywhere. Besides, if we end up together, I won't even need to work. It's an open secret he's about to be promoted. *Executive* position, which comes with *executive* pay and *executive* benefits. Hey,” she asked suddenly, “do you think maybe my tits are too small—is that the problem?”

“Honey, what matters is what *he* thinks. And to have an opinion, he's gotta see the goods.”

_____

Chad Bruder was sitting in his office, behind his desk, looking at a spreadsheet when Darla walked in. She was wearing a tight dress and carrying a card. “Morning, sir,” she said, striking a pose. Then she bent slowly forward, giving him a good view of her cleavage, before righting herself, fluttering her eyelashes and fixing her hair. She punctuated the performance with a subtle but evident *purr.*

The *purr* seemed to get Chad Bruder's attention, because it was if his body somehow rearranged, like a wave had passed through it. Darla smiled, bit her lower lip (painted the most garish shade of red imaginable) and placed the card she'd been holding on Chad Bruder's desk. Written on it, beside a lipstick stained kiss, was an address: hers. “If you're ever feeling lonely, or in the mood, or whatever,” she said seductively. “You can always call on me.”

She turned and, swinging her hips like she was the pendulum on an antique grandfather clock, sashayed out the door, into the hall, feeling so excited she almost swooned.

Chad Bruder looked at the card. He swallowed some mixed nuts. He called a committee, and the committee made a majority decision.

He tremored.

_____


Randall loitered in the Accumulus building lobby until Chad Bruder came down punctually in the elevator. He watched Chad Bruder drink water and waited while Chad Bruder spent fifteen minutes in the bathroom. Then, pulling on a baseball cap and an old vinyl windbreaker, he followed Chad Bruder out the doors. On the streets of Maninatinhat he kept what he felt was a safe distance. When Chad Bruder entered a grocery store, Randall leaned against a wall and chewed gum. When Chad Bruder came out holding a box of nuts, Randall followed him all the way home.

It turned out that hine was a long way from Maninatinhat, in a shabby apartment building all the way over in Rooklyn. (Not even Booklyn.) The walk was long, but Chad Bruder never slowed, which led Randall to conclude that despite whatever disability he had, Chad Bruder was in peak physical condition. Still, it was a little odd he hadn't taken a taxi, or public transit, thought Randall. And the building itself was well below what should have been Chad Bruder's standard. For a moment, Randall entertained the thought that the “foreign transplant” theory was correct and that Chad Bruder was working to support a large family overseas: working and saving so his loved ones had enough to eat, maybe a luxury, like chocolate or Coca Cola, once in a while. Then his natural cynicism chewed that theory up and spat it out.

When Chad Bruder entered the building, Randall stayed temporarily outside, across the street—before rushing in just in time to see the floor indicator above the elevator change. The elevator stopped on the fourth floor. He didn't know what unit Chad Bruder lived in yet, but he would find out. He had no doubt that he would find out more than anyone had ever known about Chad Bruder.

Excited, Randall exited the building and walked conspiratorially around its perimeter. The fourth floor was about level with some trees that were growing in what passed for the property’s communal green space. There was a rusted old playground, and black squirrels squeaked and barked and chased one another all around the trees and playground equipment, and even onto the building's jutting balconies. Randall knew he would never want to live here.

_____

It was late on a Saturday evening when the doorbell to Darla's apartment rang, and when she looked through the peephole in her door she saw it was Chad Bruder.

Her heart nearly went off-beat.

He was dressed in his office clothes, but Darla knew he often worked weekends, so that wasn't strange. More importantly, she didn't care. He must have been thinking about her all day. She fixed her breasts, quickly arranged her hair in the mirror and opened the apartment door, feigning total yet romantically welcome surprise. “Oh, Chad! I'm so—”

He pushed through her into the apartment (“Chad, wow—I'm…”) which she managed to turn into: her pulling him into her bedroom. Gosh, his hand feels *funny,* she thought. *Like a silk sock filled with noodles.* But then he was standing in the doorway, his shoulders so broad, his chestnut eyes so chestnut, and spreading her legs she invited him in. “I've been imagining this for a long, long time, Chad. Tell me—tell me you have too, if not with words, then—”

And he was on top of her.

*Yes,* she thought.

She closed her eyes and *purred* and his hand, caressing her neck, suddenly closed on it like a flesh-made vice. “Ch—ch… a—d,” she wheezed. Her eyes: still shut. She felt something cold and round and glass fall on her chest, roll down onto the mattress. She opened her eyes and Chad's gripping hand throttled her scream and he was missing an eye—one of his eyes was fucking gone, and in its place—in the gaping hole *where the eye should have been*, a squirrel was sticking its fucking head out, staring at her!

The squirrel squeezed through the hole and landed on her body, its little feet pitter-pattering across her bare, exposed skin, which crawled.

Another squirrel followed.

And another.

Until a dozen of them were out, were on and around her, and Chad Bruder's body was looking deflated, like an abandoned, human birthday balloon. But still he maintained his grip on her throat. She was trying to pry his fingers off. She managed it too—but before she could scream for help one of the squirrels that had emerged through Chad Bruder's empty eye socket crawled into her mouth. She was gagging. It was furry, moving. She threw up, but the squirrel was a living plug. The vomit sloshed around in her mouth, filling her. She started beating her hands against anything, everything: the bed, the squirrels, the rubbery husk that was Chad Bruder. She kicked out. She bit down. The squirrel in her mouth ***crunched,*** and she imagined breaking its little spine with her jaws, then bit her tongue. She tasted blood: hers and its. Now the other squirrels started scratching, attacking, biting her too, ripping tiny chunks of her flesh and eating it, morsel by morsel. The squirrel in her mouth was dead but she couldn't force it out. She was hyperventilating. She was having a panic attack. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't defend herself. There was less and less of her, and more and more squirrels, which ran madly around the bedroom, and she was dizzy, and she was hurting, and they were stabbing her with their sharp, nasty little teeth. Then a couple of them tore open her stomach and burrowed inside. She could feel them moving within her. And see them: small, roving distensions. They were eating her organs. Gnawing at her tendons. Until, finally, she was dead.

_____

When the deed was done and the cat-woman killed and cleaned almost to the bone, the committee reconvened and assessed the situation. “Good meat,” one squirrel said. “Yes, yes,” said another. “The threat is ended.” “We should expand our diet.” “Meat, meat, meat.” “What to do with remains?” “Deposit in Central Dark.” “Yes, yes.” “Is the man-suit damaged?” “No visible damage.” “Excellent.” “Yes, yes.” “Shift change?” “Home.” “Yes, yes.”

The squirrels re-entered Chad Bruder, disposed of their single fallen comrade, and walked purposefully home to Chad Bruder's apartment.

_____

“Shit,” cursed Randall.

He hadn't expected Chad Bruder back so soon. He tried to think of an excuse—any excuse—to allow him to get the fuck out of here, so he could show the photos and videos he'd taken of Chad Bruder's bizarre living conditions. The lack of any food but nuts. The dirt all over the floors. The complete lack of furniture. The scratches all over the walls. The door was open:* that was it!* The door was open so he'd walked in, just to see if everyone was all right. Chad Bruder probably wouldn't recognize him. A lot of people worked for Accumulus Corporation, and the executives were a bit of an Olympus from the rest. He would pretend to be a maintenance worker, *a concerned neighbour who heard something happening inside.* “Oh, hello—sorry, sorry: didn't mean to scare you,” he said as soon as Chad Bruder walked through the door. But Chad Bruder didn't look scared. He didn't look anything. “I was, uh, investigating a water leak. I'm a plumber, you see. Building management called me, and I heard some strange sounds coming from inside this unit. I thought, it must be the leak, so I, well, saw the door was open, knocked, of course, but there was no answer, so I just popped in to have a look. But, uh, looks like you, the owner, are home now, so I'll be going—”

Suffice it to say, Randall never stood a chance. He fought, even rather valiantly for a nerd, but in the end they overpowered him and had a bloody and merry feast, even letting their friends in through the balcony to partake of his raw, fresh human. Then they had shift change, and in the morning the new squirrel team went in to work as Chad Bruder.

_____

“Awful what happened, eh?” A few people were gathered around a water cooler on the tenth floor of the Accumulus building.

“I heard they found both of them in Central Dark.”

“What remained of them…”

“Chewed up by wild animals. So bad they had to use their teeth to identify them.”

“Awful.”

“One hundred percent. A tragedy. So, how do you think they died?”

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

Chad Bruder was holding a printed sheet of paper.

He held it out.

One of the water cooler people took it. The rest moved closer to look at it. The paper said, in printed capital letters: THEY WERE HAVING AFFAIR. HE KILLED HER SHOT SELF. IF AGREE PLEASE SMILE.

Everyone smiled, and, for the first time anyone could remember, Chad Bruder smiled too.

“He's going to make a fine executive,” one of the water cooler people said once Chad Bruder had left. “His theory makes a lot of sense too.” “I didn't even know either of them was married.” “Me neither.” “Just goes to show you how you never really know anyone.” “The lengths some people will go to, eh?” “Disgusting.” “Reprehensible.” “Say, weren't there supposed to be free donuts in the lunchroom today?” “Oh, right!”

_____

On the day Chad Bruder was officially promoted from middle-manager to Junior Executive, Mike Wills leapt to his death from the top floor of the Accumulus building.

The manager, Chad Bruder, rotated on his swivel chair to look at Mike. He didn't say anything. Mike Wills walked in and sat down on a chair across from Chad Bruder's desk. “So, uh, Chad—Mr Bruder—sir, I’ve been thinking, which I hope you don't mind, but I've been thinking about the work I do for the company, and how much I'm paid. As you know, I have two kids, a third on the way, and, sir, if you'll let me be frank…”

Chad Bruder listened without speaking. Not a single *mhm* or head nod. Even his breathing was controlled, professionally imperceptible. Only his eyes moved, focussing on Mike Wills’ face, then slowly drifting away—before returning with a sudden jump, as if they were a typewriter. Chad Bruder didn't open his mouth or lick his lips. He didn't even blink. His gaze was razorlike. His palms, resting on the armrests of his office chair, upturned as if he were meditating.

Mike Wills kept talking, increasingly in circles, tripping over his words, starting to sweat, misremembering his argument, messing up its expression until, unable to take the tension anymore, he abruptly finished by thanking Chad Bruder for his time and going off script: “Actually, I see it now. The company really does pay me what I'm worth. That's what it's about. It's not about, uh, how much I need but how valuable I am to the company. There are others more valuable, and they get paid more, and if—if I want to make as much as they do, which I don't—at the moment, I don't—I need to work as much and as well as they do. Even the fact I have kids, that's a liability. It's a selfish choice. I understand that, Mr Bruder, sir.” He was fishing for a reaction: something, but Chad Bruder was not forthcoming. His drifting eyes carriage returned. Mike Wills went on, “So, I guess I came here to ask for a raise, but what I've gotten from you is infinitely more valuable: knowledge, a better, less emotional, more mature perspective on the world and my own self-worth and place in it. I'm grateful for that. Grateful that you let me talk it out. No judgement. No anger. You're a patient man, Mr Gruder, sir. And an excellent manager. Thank you. Thank you!” And, with that, Mike Wills stood up, bowed awkwardly while backing away towards the door, and left Chad Bruder's office to return to his cubicle.

Chad Bruder rotated on his swivel chair to look at his computer screen. Spreadsheets were on it. On the desk, beside the computer, sat a plastic box filled with assorted nuts. Chad Bruder lifted an arm, lowered it over the box, closed his hands on a selection of the nuts and lifted those to his mouth. These he swallowed without chewing.

The clock read 1:15 p.m.

The Accumulus Corporation building thrummed with money-making.

In a boardroom:

“Bruder?” an executive said. “Why, he's one of our finest men. His teams always excel in productivity. He's a very capable middle-manager.”

“But does he ever, you know: talk?”

The executive dropped his voice. “Listen, just between the two of us, he was a diversity hire. Disability, and not the visible kind. He's obviously not a Grade-A Retard, with the eyes and the *arf-arf-arf*’ing. As far as I know, no one really does know what’s ‘wrong’ with him. Not that anything *is* ‘wrong.’ He's just different—in some way—that no one’s privy to know. But he is a fully capable and dignified individual, and Accumulus supports him in all his endeavours.”

“I guess I just find him creepy, that's all,” said the other executive, whose name was Randall. “I'm sure he's fine at his job. I have no reason to doubt his dedication or capabilities. It's just, you know, his interpersonal skills…”

“So you would oppose his promotion?” asked the first executive, raising a greying and bushy, well-rehearsed right eyebrow.

“Oh, no—God, no! Not in the least,” said Randall.

“Good.”

“These are just my own, personal observations. We need someone we can work with.”

“He'll play ball,” said the first executive. “Besides, if not him, then who: a woman?” They both laughed uproariously at this. “At least Bruder knows the code. He'll be an old boy soon enough.”

“Very well,” said Randall.

“But, you do understand, I'll have to write you up for this,” said the first executive.

“For?”

“Expression of a prejudiced opinion. Nothing serious, just a formality, really; but it must be done. It may even be good for your career in the long run. You own the mistake, demonstrate personal growth. Learning opportunity, as they say. Take your penance and move on, with a nice, concrete example of a time you bettered yourself in your pocket to pull out at the next interview.”

“Thank you,” said Randall.

“Don't mention it. Friends look out for each other,” said the first executive.

“Actually, I think I'll report you, too.”

“Great. What for?”

“Nepotism. Handing out write-ups based on a criteria other than merit.”

“Oh, that's a good one. I don't think I've had one of those before. That will look very good in my file. It may even push me over the edge next time. Fingers respectfully crossed. Every dog has his day.”

“I love to help,” said Randall.

To satiate his curiosity about Chad Bruder, Randall began a small info-gathering campaign. No one who currently worked—or had worked—under Bruder was willing (or able) to say anything at all about the man, but, as always, there were rumours: that Chad had been born without a larynx, that he came from a country (no one knew which) whose diet was almost exclusively nut-based, that he wasn't actually physically impaired and his silence was voluntary, that he worked a part-time job as a monk concurrently with his job for Accumulus Corporation, that he had no wife and children, that he had a wife and two children, that he had two wives and one child, that he had a husband, a common-law wife and three children, all of whom were adopted, and so on.

_____

At 5:00 p.m., Chad Bruder got up from his desk, exited his office and took the elevator down to the lobby. In the lobby, he took an exceedingly long drink from a water fountain. He went into a bathroom, and after about a quarter of an hour came out. He then walked to a small, organic grocery store, where the staff all knew him and always had his purchase—a box of mixed nuts—ready. They charged his credit card. He walked stiffly but with purpose. His face remained expressionless. Only his typewriter-eyes moved. Holding his nuts, he walked straight home.

_____

“Well, *I* happen to think he's kinda sexy,” said Darla, one of the numerous secretaries who worked in the Accumulus Corporation building. “Strong silent type, you know? And that salary!”

“What about that other guy, Randall?” asked her friend.

They were having coffee.

“Randall is a complete and total nerd. You may as well ask me why I don't wanna date Mike Wills.”

“Eww! Now that one's a real jellyfish!”

“And married!”

“Really? I always thought he was just making that up—you know, to seem normal. The kids, too.”

“Oh? Maybe he is.”

“That's what I think because, like, what kind of sponge would marry him? Plus he keeps talking about his family: how much he loves his wife, how great his kids are. I mean, who does that? Like, if you don't have anything interesting to say, just shut the fuck up.”

“Like Chad Bruder,” said Darla.

“Ohmygod, you slut—you really *do* have a thing for him, don't you?”

Darla blushed. (It was a skill she'd spent hours practicing in front of the mirror, with visible results.) “Stop! OK? He just seems like a real man. That's rare these days. Plus he's got that wild, animal magnetism.”

_____

Randall was at a dead end—*multiple* dead ends, in fact. (And a few in pure conjecture, too.) There was almost nothing substantive about Chad Bruder in the employment file. HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation. Sorry.”

_____

“I swear, he looks at me like I'm a freakin’ spreadsheet—*and I fucking love it*,” Darla told her friend. “I've made sure to walk past his office over and over, and if he looks up, it's with those penetrating, slightly lazy eyes of his. Chestnut brown. No change of expression whatsoever. It's like he has no interest in me at all. God, that makes me so hot.”

“Have you talked to him?”

Darla gave her a look. “Right,” said her friend: “He doesn't do that: talk.”

“So what do I do?”

“Well, maybe he's gay or something. You ever thought of that? It would explain a lot.”

“He is *not* gay. Don't even say that!”

“If you're so sure, then he's obviously just playing hard to get, so what you gotta do is: play harder. Just be careful. Don't risk your job. Office dating is a minefield. You probably have a policy about it.”

“Screw the job. I can be a secretary anywhere. Besides, if we end up together, I won't even need to work. It's an open secret he's about to be promoted. *Executive* position, which comes with *executive* pay and *executive* benefits. Hey,” she asked suddenly, “do you think maybe my tits are too small—is that the problem?”

“Honey, what matters is what *he* thinks. And to have an opinion, he's gotta see the goods.”

_____

Chad Bruder was sitting in his office, behind his desk, looking at a spreadsheet when Darla walked in. She was wearing a tight dress and carrying a card. “Morning, sir,” she said, striking a pose. Then she bent slowly forward, giving him a good view of her cleavage, before righting herself, fluttering her eyelashes and fixing her hair. She punctuated the performance with a subtle but evident *purr.*

The *purr* seemed to get Chad Bruder's attention, because it was if his body somehow rearranged, like a wave had passed through it. Darla smiled, bit her lower lip (painted the most garish shade of red imaginable) and placed the card she'd been holding on Chad Bruder's desk. Written on it, beside a lipstick stained kiss, was an address: hers. “If you're ever feeling lonely, or in the mood, or whatever,” she said seductively. “You can always call on me.”

She turned and, swinging her hips like she was the pendulum on an antique grandfather clock, sashayed out the door, into the hall, feeling so excited she almost swooned.

Chad Bruder looked at the card. He swallowed some mixed nuts. He called a committee, and the committee made a majority decision.

He tremored.

_____


Randall loitered in the Accumulus building lobby until Chad Bruder came down punctually in the elevator. He watched Chad Bruder drink water and waited while Chad Bruder spent fifteen minutes in the bathroom. Then, pulling on a baseball cap and an old vinyl windbreaker, he followed Chad Bruder out the doors. On the streets of Maninatinhat he kept what he felt was a safe distance. When Chad Bruder entered a grocery store, Randall leaned against a wall and chewed gum. When Chad Bruder came out holding a box of nuts, Randall followed him all the way home.

It turned out that hine was a long way from Maninatinhat, in a shabby apartment building all the way over in Rooklyn. (Not even Booklyn.) The walk was long, but Chad Bruder never slowed, which led Randall to conclude that despite whatever disability he had, Chad Bruder was in peak physical condition. Still, it was a little odd he hadn't taken a taxi, or public transit, thought Randall. And the building itself was well below what should have been Chad Bruder's standard. For a moment, Randall entertained the thought that the “foreign transplant” theory was correct and that Chad Bruder was working to support a large family overseas: working and saving so his loved ones had enough to eat, maybe a luxury, like chocolate or Coca Cola, once in a while. Then his natural cynicism chewed that theory up and spat it out.

When Chad Bruder entered the building, Randall stayed temporarily outside, across the street—before rushing in just in time to see the floor indicator above the elevator change. The elevator stopped on the fourth floor. He didn't know what unit Chad Bruder lived in yet, but he would find out. He had no doubt that he would find out more than anyone had ever known about Chad Bruder.

Excited, Randall exited the building and walked conspiratorially around its perimeter. The fourth floor was about level with some trees that were growing in what passed for the property’s communal green space. There was a rusted old playground, and black squirrels squeaked and barked and chased one another all around the trees and playground equipment, and even onto the building's jutting balconies. Randall knew he would never want to live here.

_____

It was late on a Saturday evening when the doorbell to Darla's apartment rang, and when she looked through the peephole in her door she saw it was Chad Bruder.

Her heart nearly went off-beat.

He was dressed in his office clothes, but Darla knew he often worked weekends, so that wasn't strange. More importantly, she didn't care. He must have been thinking about her all day. She fixed her breasts, quickly arranged her hair in the mirror and opened the apartment door, feigning total yet romantically welcome surprise. “Oh, Chad! I'm so—”

He pushed through her into the apartment (“Chad, wow—I'm…”) which she managed to turn into: her pulling him into her bedroom. Gosh, his hand feels *funny,* she thought. *Like a silk sock filled with noodles.* But then he was standing in the doorway, his shoulders so broad, his chestnut eyes so chestnut, and spreading her legs she invited him in. “I've been imagining this for a long, long time, Chad. Tell me—tell me you have too, if not with words, then—”

And he was on top of her.

*Yes,* she thought.

She closed her eyes and *purred* and his hand, caressing her neck, suddenly closed on it like a flesh-made vice. “Ch—ch… a—d,” she wheezed. Her eyes: still shut. She felt something cold and round and glass fall on her chest, roll down onto the mattress. She opened her eyes and Chad's gripping hand throttled her scream and he was missing an eye—one of his eyes was fucking gone, and in its place—in the gaping hole *where the eye should have been*, a squirrel was sticking its fucking head out, staring at her!

The squirrel squeezed through the hole and landed on her body, its little feet pitter-pattering across her bare, exposed skin, which crawled.

Another squirrel followed.

And another.

Until a dozen of them were out, were on and around her, and Chad Bruder's body was looking deflated, like an abandoned, human birthday balloon. But still he maintained his grip on her throat. She was trying to pry his fingers off. She managed it too—but before she could scream for help one of the squirrels that had emerged through Chad Bruder's empty eye socket crawled into her mouth. She was gagging. It was furry, moving. She threw up, but the squirrel was a living plug. The vomit sloshed around in her mouth, filling her. She started beating her hands against anything, everything: the bed, the squirrels, the rubbery husk that was Chad Bruder. She kicked out. She bit down. The squirrel in her mouth ***crunched,*** and she imagined breaking its little spine with her jaws, then bit her tongue. She tasted blood: hers and its. Now the other squirrels started scratching, attacking, biting her too, ripping tiny chunks of her flesh and eating it, morsel by morsel. The squirrel in her mouth was dead but she couldn't force it out. She was hyperventilating. She was having a panic attack. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't defend herself. There was less and less of her, and more and more squirrels, which ran madly around the bedroom, and she was dizzy, and she was hurting, and they were stabbing her with their sharp, nasty little teeth. Then a couple of them tore open her stomach and burrowed inside. She could feel them moving within her. And see them: small, roving distensions. They were eating her organs. Gnawing at her tendons. Until, finally, she was dead.

_____

When the deed was done and the cat-woman killed and cleaned almost to the bone, the committee reconvened and assessed the situation. “Good meat,” one squirrel said. “Yes, yes,” said another. “The threat is ended.” “We should expand our diet.” “Meat, meat, meat.” “What to do with remains?” “Deposit in Central Dark.” “Yes, yes.” “Is the man-suit damaged?” “No visible damage.” “Excellent.” “Yes, yes.” “Shift change?” “Home.” “Yes, yes.”

The squirrels re-entered Chad Bruder, disposed of their single fallen comrade, and walked purposefully home to Chad Bruder's apartment.

_____

“Shit,” cursed Randall.

He hadn't expected Chad Bruder back so soon. He tried to think of an excuse—any excuse—to allow him to get the fuck out of here, so he could show the photos and videos he'd taken of Chad Bruder's bizarre living conditions. The lack of any food but nuts. The dirt all over the floors. The complete lack of furniture. The scratches all over the walls. The door was open:* that was it!* The door was open so he'd walked in, just to see if everyone was all right. Chad Bruder probably wouldn't recognize him. A lot of people worked for Accumulus Corporation, and the executives were a bit of an Olympus from the rest. He would pretend to be a maintenance worker, *a concerned neighbour who heard something happening inside.* “Oh, hello—sorry, sorry: didn't mean to scare you,” he said as soon as Chad Bruder walked through the door. But Chad Bruder didn't look scared. He didn't look anything. “I was, uh, investigating a water leak. I'm a plumber, you see. Building management called me, and I heard some strange sounds coming from inside this unit. I thought, it must be the leak, so I, well, saw the door was open, knocked, of course, but there was no answer, so I just popped in to have a look. But, uh, looks like you, the owner, are home now, so I'll be going—”

Suffice it to say, Randall never stood a chance. He fought, even rather valiantly for a nerd, but in the end they overpowered him and had a bloody and merry feast, even letting their friends in through the balcony to partake of his raw, fresh human. Then they had shift change, and in the morning the new squirrel team went in to work as Chad Bruder.

_____

“Awful what happened, eh?” A few people were gathered around a water cooler on the tenth floor of the Accumulus building.

“I heard they found both of them in Central Dark.”

“What remained of them…”

“Chewed up by wild animals. So bad they had to use their teeth to identify them.”

“Awful.”

“One hundred percent. A tragedy. So, how do you think they died?”

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

Chad Bruder was holding a printed sheet of paper.

He held it out.

One of the water cooler people took it. The rest moved closer to look at it. The paper said, in printed capital letters: THEY WERE HAVING AFFAIR. HE KILLED HER SHOT SELF. IF AGREE PLEASE SMILE.

Everyone smiled, and, for the first time anyone could remember, Chad Bruder smiled too.

“He's going to make a fine executive,” one of the water cooler people said once Chad Bruder had left. “His theory makes a lot of sense too.” “I didn't even know either of them was married.” “Me neither.” “Just goes to show you how you never really know anyone.” “The lengths some people will go to, eh?” “Disgusting.” “Reprehensible.” “Say, weren't there supposed to be free donuts in the lunchroom today?” “Oh, right!”

On the day Chad Bruder was officially promoted from middle-manager to Junior Executive, Mike Wills leapt to his death from the top floor of the Accumulus building. His wife had declared she was divorcing him and taking their kids to Lost Angeles to live with her mother. “I just can't live with a jellyfish like you,” she’d told him.

Sadly, Mike Wills’ act of quiet desperation was altogether too quiet, for he had jumped inopportunely, coincident with Chad Bruder's celebratory lunch, which meant nobody saw him fall.

HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation. Sorry.”

“I swear, he looks at me like I'm a freakin’ spreadsheet—*and I fucking love it*,” Darla told her friend. “I've made sure to walk past his office over and over, and if he looks up, it's with those penetrating, slightly lazy eyes of his. Chestnut brown. No change of expression whatsoever. It's like he has no interest in me at all. God, that makes me so hot.”

“Have you talked to him?”

Darla gave her a look. “Right,” said her friend: “He doesn't do that: talk.”

“So what do I do?”

“Well, maybe he's gay or something. You ever thought of that? It would explain a lot.”

“He is *not* gay. Don't even say that!”

“If you're so sure, then he's obviously just playing hard to get, so what you gotta do is: play harder. Just be careful. Don't risk your job. Office dating is a minefield. You probably have a policy about it.”

“Screw the job. I can be a secretary anywhere. Besides, if we end up together, I won't even need to work. It's an open secret he's about to be promoted. *Executive* position, which comes with *executive* pay and *executive* benefits. Hey,” she asked suddenly, “do you think maybe my tits are too small—is that the problem?”

“Honey, what matters is what *he* thinks. And to have an opinion, he's gotta see the goods.”

Chad Bruder was sitting in his office, behind his desk, looking at a spreadsheet when Darla walked in. She was wearing a tight dress and carrying a card. “Morning, sir,” she said, striking a pose. Then she bent slowly forward, giving him a good view of her cleavage, before righting herself, fluttering her eyelashes and fixing her hair. She punctuated the performance with a subtle but evident *purr.*

The *purr* seemed to get Chad Bruder's attention, because it was if his body somehow rearranged, like a wave had passed through it. Darla smiled, bit her lower lip (painted the most garish shade of red imaginable) and placed the card she'd been holding on Chad Bruder's desk. Written on it, beside a lipstick stained kiss, was an address: hers. “If you're ever feeling lonely, or in the mood, or whatever,” she said seductively. “You can always call on me.”

She turned and, swinging her hips like she was the pendulum on an antique grandfather clock, sashayed out the door, into the hall, feeling so excited she almost swooned.

Chad Bruder looked at the card. He swallowed some mixed nuts. He called a committee, and the committee made a majority decision.

He tremored.

_____


Randall loitered in the Accumulus building lobby until Chad Bruder came down punctually in the elevator. He watched Chad Bruder drink water and waited while Chad Bruder spent fifteen minutes in the bathroom. Then, pulling on a baseball cap and an old vinyl windbreaker, he followed Chad Bruder out the doors. On the streets of Maninatinhat he kept what he felt was a safe distance. When Chad Bruder entered a grocery store, Randall leaned against a wall and chewed gum. When Chad Bruder came out holding a box of nuts, Randall followed him all the way home.

It turned out that hine was a long way from Maninatinhat, in a shabby apartment building all the way over in Rooklyn. (Not even Booklyn.) The walk was long, but Chad Bruder never slowed, which led Randall to conclude that despite whatever disability he had, Chad Bruder was in peak physical condition. Still, it was a little odd he hadn't taken a taxi, or public transit, thought Randall. And the building itself was well below what should have been Chad Bruder's standard. For a moment, Randall entertained the thought that the “foreign transplant” theory was correct and that Chad Bruder was working to support a large family overseas: working and saving so his loved ones had enough to eat, maybe a luxury, like chocolate or Coca Cola, once in a while. Then his natural cynicism chewed that theory up and spat it out.

When Chad Bruder entered the building, Randall stayed temporarily outside, across the street—before rushing in just in time to see the floor indicator above the elevator change. The elevator stopped on the fourth floor. He didn't know what unit Chad Bruder lived in yet, but he would find out. He had no doubt that he would find out more than anyone had ever known about Chad Bruder.

Excited, Randall exited the building and walked conspiratorially around its perimeter. The fourth floor was about level with some trees that were growing in what passed for the property’s communal green space. There was a rusted old playground, and black squirrels squeaked and barked and chased one another all around the trees and playground equipment, and even onto the building's jutting balconies. Randall knew he would never want to live here.

It was late on a Saturday evening when the doorbell to Darla's apartment rang, and when she looked through the peephole in her door she saw it was Chad Bruder.

Her heart nearly went off-beat.

He was dressed in his office clothes, but Darla knew he often worked weekends, so that wasn't strange. More importantly, she didn't care. He must have been thinking about her all day. She fixed her breasts, quickly arranged her hair in the mirror and opened the apartment door, feigning total yet romantically welcome surprise. “Oh, Chad! I'm so—”

He pushed through her into the apartment (“Chad, wow—I'm…”) which she managed to turn into: her pulling him into her bedroom. Gosh, his hand feels *funny,* she thought. *Like a silk sock filled with noodles.* But then he was standing in the doorway, his shoulders so broad, his chestnut eyes so chestnut, and spreading her legs she invited him in. “I've been imagining this for a long, long time, Chad. Tell me—tell me you have too, if not with words, then—”

And he was on top of her.

*Yes,* she thought.

She closed her eyes and *purred* and his hand, caressing her neck, suddenly closed on it like a flesh-made vice. “Ch—ch… a—d,” she wheezed. Her eyes: still shut. She felt something cold and round and glass fall on her chest, roll down onto the mattress. She opened her eyes and Chad's gripping hand throttled her scream and he was missing an eye—one of his eyes was fucking gone, and in its place—in the gaping hole *where the eye should have been*, a squirrel was sticking its fucking head out, staring at her!

The squirrel squeezed through the hole and landed on her body, its little feet pitter-pattering across her bare, exposed skin, which crawled.

Another squirrel followed.

And another.

Until a dozen of them were out, were on and around her, and Chad Bruder's body was looking deflated, like an abandoned, human birthday balloon. But still he maintained his grip on her throat. She was trying to pry his fingers off. She managed it too—but before she could scream for help one of the squirrels that had emerged through Chad Bruder's empty eye socket crawled into her mouth. She was gagging. It was furry, moving. She threw up, but the squirrel was a living plug. The vomit sloshed around in her mouth, filling her. She started beating her hands against anything, everything: the bed, the squirrels, the rubbery husk that was Chad Bruder. She kicked out. She bit down. The squirrel in her mouth ***crunched,*** and she imagined breaking its little spine with her jaws, then bit her tongue. She tasted blood: hers and its. Now the other squirrels started scratching, attacking, biting her too, ripping tiny chunks of her flesh and eating it, morsel by morsel. The squirrel in her mouth was dead but she couldn't force it out. She was hyperventilating. She was having a panic attack. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't defend herself. There was less and less of her, and more and more squirrels, which ran madly around the bedroom, and she was dizzy, and she was hurting, and they were stabbing her with their sharp, nasty little teeth. Then a couple of them tore open her stomach and burrowed inside. She could feel them moving within her. And see them: small, roving distensions. They were eating her organs. Gnawing at her tendons. Until, finally, she was dead.

_____

When the deed was done and the cat-woman killed and cleaned almost to the bone, the committee reconvened and assessed the situation. “Good meat,” one squirrel said. “Yes, yes,” said another. “The threat is ended.” “We should expand our diet.” “Meat, meat, meat.” “What to do with remains?” “Deposit in Central Dark.” “Yes, yes.” “Is the man-suit damaged?” “No visible damage.” “Excellent.” “Yes, yes.” “Shift change?” “Home.” “Yes, yes.”

The squirrels re-entered Chad Bruder, disposed of their single fallen comrade, and walked purposefully home to Chad Bruder's apartment.

_____

“Shit,” cursed Randall.

He hadn't expected Chad Bruder back so soon. He tried to think of an excuse—any excuse—to allow him to get the fuck out of here, so he could show the photos and videos he'd taken of Chad Bruder's bizarre living conditions. The lack of any food but nuts. The dirt all over the floors. The complete lack of furniture. The scratches all over the walls. The door was open:* that was it!* The door was open so he'd walked in, just to see if everyone was all right. Chad Bruder probably wouldn't recognize him. A lot of people worked for Accumulus Corporation, and the executives were a bit of an Olympus from the rest. He would pretend to be a maintenance worker, *a concerned neighbour who heard something happening inside.* “Oh, hello—sorry, sorry: didn't mean to scare you,” he said as soon as Chad Bruder walked through the door. But Chad Bruder didn't look scared. He didn't look anything. “I was, uh, investigating a water leak. I'm a plumber, you see. Building management called me, and I heard some strange sounds coming from inside this unit. I thought, it must be the leak, so I, well, saw the door was open, knocked, of course, but there was no answer, so I just popped in to have a look. But, uh, looks like you, the owner, are home now, so I'll be going—”

Suffice it to say, Randall never stood a chance. He fought, even rather valiantly for a nerd, but in the end they overpowered him and had a bloody and merry feast, even letting their friends in through the balcony to partake of his raw, fresh human. Then they had shift change, and in the morning the new squirrel team went in to work as Chad Bruder.

_____

“Awful what happened, eh?” A few people were gathered around a water cooler on the tenth floor of the Accumulus building.

“I heard they found both of them in Central Dark.”

“What remained of them…”

“Chewed up by wild animals. So bad they had to use their teeth to identify them.”

“Awful.”

“One hundred percent. A tragedy. So, how do you think they died?”

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

Chad Bruder was holding a printed sheet of paper.

He held it out.

One of the water cooler people took it. The rest moved closer to look at it. The paper said, in printed capital letters: THEY WERE HAVING AFFAIR. HE KILLED HER SHOT SELF. IF AGREE PLEASE SMILE.

Everyone smiled, and, for the first time anyone could remember, Chad Bruder smiled too.

“He's going to make a fine executive,” one of the water cooler people said once Chad Bruder had left. “His theory makes a lot of sense too.” “I didn't even know either of them was married.” “Me neither.” “Just goes to show you how you never really know anyone.” “The lengths some people will go to, eh?” “Disgusting.” “Reprehensible.” “Say, weren't there supposed to be free donuts in the lunchroom today?” “Oh, right!”

On the day Chad Bruder was officially promoted from middle-manager to Junior Executive, Mike Wills leapt to his death from the top floor of the Accumulus building. His wife had declared she was divorcing him and taking their kids to Lost Angeles to live with her mother. “I just can't live with a jellyfish like you,” she’d told him.

Sadly, Mike Wills’ act of quiet desperation was altogether too quiet, for he had jumped inopportunely, coincident with Chad Bruder's celebratory lunch, which meant nobody saw him fall. Moreover, he landed on a pile of old mattresses—the soiled by-products of a recent Executives Party—that had been left out for the garbage collectors to pick up. But the garbage collectors were on strike, so no one picked them up for two weeks. The mattresses, which had dampened the sound of Mike Wills’ impact, had also initially saved his life. However, his body was badly broken by the fall, and at some point between that day and the day the garbage *was* collected, he expired. Voiceless and in agony. When it came time to identify the body, nobody could quite remember his name or if he had even worked there. When the police finally reached his estranged wife with the news, she told them she couldn't talk because she'd taken up surfing.",1,1764726073.0,horrorstories,1,1.0,False
1pcr4gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1pcr4gm/life_is_nuts_the_chad_bruder_story/,Life Is Nuts: The Chad Bruder Story,"Mike Wills knocked weakly on his manager’s office door. The manager, Chad Bruder, rotated on his swivel chair to look at Mike. He didn't say anything. Mike Wills walked in and sat down on a chair across from Chad Bruder's desk. “So, uh, Chad—Mr Bruder—sir, I’ve been thinking, which I hope you don't mind, but I've been thinking about the work I do for the company, and how much I'm paid. As you know, I have two kids, a third on the way, and, sir, if you'll let me be frank…”

Chad Bruder listened without speaking. Not a single *mhm* or head nod. Even his breathing was controlled, professionally imperceptible. Only his eyes moved, focussing on Mike Wills’ face, then slowly drifting away—before returning with a sudden jump, as if they were a typewriter. Chad Bruder didn't open his mouth or lick his lips. He didn't even blink. His gaze was razorlike. His palms, resting on the armrests of his office chair, upturned as if he were meditating.

Mike Wills kept talking, increasingly in circles, tripping over his words, starting to sweat, misremembering his argument, messing up its expression until, unable to take the tension anymore, he abruptly finished by thanking Chad Bruder for his time and going off script: “Actually, I see it now. The company really does pay me what I'm worth. That's what it's about. It's not about, uh, how much I need but how valuable I am to the company. There are others more valuable, and they get paid more, and if—if I want to make as much as they do, which I don't—at the moment, I don't—I need to work as much and as well as they do. Even the fact I have kids, that's a liability. It's a selfish choice. I understand that, Mr Bruder, sir.” He was fishing for a reaction: something, but Chad Bruder was not forthcoming. His drifting eyes carriage returned. Mike Wills went on, “So, I guess I came here to ask for a raise, but what I've gotten from you is infinitely more valuable: knowledge, a better, less emotional, more mature perspective on the world and my own self-worth and place in it. I'm grateful for that. Grateful that you let me talk it out. No judgement. No anger. You're a patient man, Mr Gruder, sir. And an excellent manager. Thank you. Thank you!” And, with that, Mike Wills stood up, bowed awkwardly while backing away towards the door, and left Chad Bruder's office to return to his cubicle.

Chad Bruder rotated on his swivel chair to look at his computer screen. Spreadsheets were on it. On the desk, beside the computer, sat a plastic box filled with assorted nuts. Chad Bruder lifted an arm, lowered it over the box, closed his hands on a selection of the nuts and lifted those to his mouth. These he swallowed without chewing.

The clock read 1:15 p.m.

The Accumulus Corporation building thrummed with money-making.

In a boardroom:

“Bruder?” an executive said. “Why, he's one of our finest men. His teams always excel in productivity. He's a very capable middle-manager.”

“But does he ever, you know: talk?”

The executive dropped his voice. “Listen, just between the two of us, he was a diversity hire. Disability, and not the visible kind. He's obviously not a Grade-A Retard, with the eyes and the *arf-arf-arf*’ing. As far as I know, no one really does know what’s ‘wrong’ with him. Not that anything *is* ‘wrong.’ He's just different—in some way—that no one’s privy to know. But he is a fully capable and dignified individual, and Accumulus supports him in all his endeavours.”

“I guess I just find him creepy, that's all,” said the other executive, whose name was Randall. “I'm sure he's fine at his job. I have no reason to doubt his dedication or capabilities. It's just, you know, his interpersonal skills…”

“So you would oppose his promotion?” asked the first executive, raising a greying and bushy, well-rehearsed right eyebrow.

“Oh, no—God, no! Not in the least,” said Randall.

“Good.”

“These are just my own, personal observations. We need someone we can work with.”

“He'll play ball,” said the first executive. “Besides, if not him, then who: a woman?” They both laughed uproariously at this. “At least Bruder knows the code. He'll be an old boy soon enough.”

“Very well,” said Randall.

“But, you do understand, I'll have to write you up for this,” said the first executive.

“For?”

“Expression of a prejudiced opinion. Nothing serious, just a formality, really; but it must be done. It may even be good for your career in the long run. You own the mistake, demonstrate personal growth. Learning opportunity, as they say. Take your penance and move on, with a nice, concrete example of a time you bettered yourself in your pocket to pull out at the next interview.”

“Thank you,” said Randall.

“Don't mention it. Friends look out for each other,” said the first executive.

“Actually, I think I'll report you, too.”

“Great. What for?”

“Nepotism. Handing out write-ups based on a criteria other than merit.”

“Oh, that's a good one. I don't think I've had one of those before. That will look very good in my file. It may even push me over the edge next time. Fingers respectfully crossed. Every dog has his day.”

“I love to help,” said Randall.

To satiate his curiosity about Chad Bruder, Randall began a small info-gathering campaign. No one who currently worked—or had worked—under Bruder was willing (or able) to say anything at all about the man, but, as always, there were rumours: that Chad had been born without a larynx, that he came from a country (no one knew which) whose diet was almost exclusively nut-based, that he wasn't actually physically impaired and his silence was voluntary, that he worked a part-time job as a monk concurrently with his job for Accumulus Corporation, that he had no wife and children, that he had a wife and two children, that he had two wives and one child, that he had a husband, a common-law wife and three children, all of whom were adopted, and so on.

_____

At 5:00 p.m., Chad Bruder got up from his desk, exited his office and took the elevator down to the lobby. In the lobby, he took an exceedingly long drink from a water fountain. He went into a bathroom, and after about a quarter of an hour came out. He then walked to a small, organic grocery store, where the staff all knew him and always had his purchase—a box of mixed nuts—ready. They charged his credit card. He walked stiffly but with purpose. His face remained expressionless. Only his typewriter-eyes moved. Holding his nuts, he walked straight home.

_____

“Well, *I* happen to think he's kinda sexy,” said Darla, one of the numerous secretaries who worked in the Accumulus Corporation building. “Strong silent type, you know? And that salary!”

“What about that other guy, Randall?” asked her friend.

They were having coffee.

“Randall is a complete and total nerd. You may as well ask me why I don't wanna date Mike Wills.”

“Eww! Now that one's a real jellyfish!”

“And married!”

“Really? I always thought he was just making that up—you know, to seem normal. The kids, too.”

“Oh? Maybe he is.”

“That's what I think because, like, what kind of sponge would marry him? Plus he keeps talking about his family: how much he loves his wife, how great his kids are. I mean, who does that? Like, if you don't have anything interesting to say, just shut the fuck up.”

“Like Chad Bruder,” said Darla.

“Ohmygod, you slut—you really *do* have a thing for him, don't you?”

Darla blushed. (It was a skill she'd spent hours practicing in front of the mirror, with visible results.) “Stop! OK? He just seems like a real man. That's rare these days. Plus he's got that wild, animal magnetism.”

Randall was at a dead end—*multiple* dead ends, in fact. (And a few in pure conjecture, too.) There was almost nothing substantive about Chad Bruder in the employment file. HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation.

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

Chad Bruder was holding a printed sheet of paper.

He held it out.

One of the water cooler people took it. The rest moved closer to look at it. The paper said, in printed capital letters: THEY WERE HAVING AFFAIR. HE KILLED HER SHOT SELF. IF AGREE PLEASE SMILE.

Everyone smiled, and, for the first time anyone could remember, Chad Bruder smiled too.

“He's going to make a fine executive,” one of the water cooler people said once Chad Bruder had left. “His theory makes a lot of sense too.” “I didn't even know either of them was married.” “Me neither.” “Just goes to show you how you never really know anyone.” “The lengths some people will go to, eh?” “Disgusting.” “Reprehensible.” “Say, weren't there supposed to be free donuts in the lunchroom today?” “Oh, right!”

On the day Chad Bruder was officially promoted from middle-manager to Junior Executive, Mike Wills leapt to his death from the top floor of the Accumulus building. His wife had declared she was divorcing him and taking their kids to Lost Angeles to live with her mother. “I just can't live with a jellyfish like you,” she’d told him.

Sadly, Mike Wills’ act of quiet desperation was altogether too quiet, for he had jumped inopportunely, coincident with Chad Bruder's celebratory lunch, which meant nobody saw him fall. Moreover, he landed on a pile of old mattresses—the soiled by-products of a recent Executives Party—that had been left out for the garbage collectors to pick up. But the garbage collectors were on strike, so no one picked them up for two weeks. The mattresses, which had dampened the sound of Mike Wills’ impact, had also initially saved his life. However, his body was badly broken by the fall, and at some point between that day and the day the garbage *was* collected, he expired. Voiceless and in agony. When it came time to identify the body, nobody could quite remember his name or if he had even worked there. When the police finally reached his estranged wife with the news, she told them she couldn't talk because she'd taken up surfing.",1,1764726057.0,deepnightsociety,1,1.0,False

The manager, Chad Bruder, rotated on his swivel chair to look at Mike. He didn't say anything. Mike Wills walked in and sat down on a chair across from Chad Bruder's desk. “So, uh, Chad—Mr Bruder—sir, I’ve been thinking, which I hope you don't mind, but I've been thinking about the work I do for the company, and how much I'm paid. As you know, I have two kids, a third on the way, and, sir, if you'll let me be frank…”

Chad Bruder listened without speaking. Not a single *mhm* or head nod. Even his breathing was controlled, professionally imperceptible. Only his eyes moved, focussing on Mike Wills’ face, then slowly drifting away—before returning with a sudden jump, as if they were a typewriter. Chad Bruder didn't open his mouth or lick his lips. He didn't even blink. His gaze was razorlike. His palms, resting on the armrests of his office chair, upturned as if he were meditating.

Mike Wills kept talking, increasingly in circles, tripping over his words, starting to sweat, misremembering his argument, messing up its expression until, unable to take the tension anymore, he abruptly finished by thanking Chad Bruder for his time and going off script: “Actually, I see it now. The company really does pay me what I'm worth. That's what it's about. It's not about, uh, how much I need but how valuable I am to the company. There are others more valuable, and they get paid more, and if—if I want to make as much as they do, which I don't—at the moment, I don't—I need to work as much and as well as they do. Even the fact I have kids, that's a liability. It's a selfish choice. I understand that, Mr Bruder, sir.” He was fishing for a reaction: something, but Chad Bruder was not forthcoming. His drifting eyes carriage returned. Mike Wills went on, “So, I guess I came here to ask for a raise, but what I've gotten from you is infinitely more valuable: knowledge, a better, less emotional, more mature perspective on the world and my own self-worth and place in it. I'm grateful for that. Grateful that you let me talk it out. No judgement. No anger. You're a patient man, Mr Gruder, sir. And an excellent manager. Thank you. Thank you!” And, with that, Mike Wills stood up, bowed awkwardly while backing away towards the door, and left Chad Bruder's office to return to his cubicle.

Chad Bruder rotated on his swivel chair to look at his computer screen. Spreadsheets were on it. On the desk, beside the computer, sat a plastic box filled with assorted nuts. Chad Bruder lifted an arm, lowered it over the box, closed his hands on a selection of the nuts and lifted those to his mouth. These he swallowed without chewing.

The clock read 1:15 p.m.

The Accumulus Corporation building thrummed with money-making.

In a boardroom:

“Bruder?” an executive said. “Why, he's one of our finest men. His teams always excel in productivity. He's a very capable middle-manager.”

“But does he ever, you know: talk?”

The executive dropped his voice. “Listen, just between the two of us, he was a diversity hire. Disability, and not the visible kind. He's obviously not a Grade-A Retard, with the eyes and the *arf-arf-arf*’ing. As far as I know, no one really does know what’s ‘wrong’ with him. Not that anything *is* ‘wrong.’ He's just different—in some way—that no one’s privy to know. But he is a fully capable and dignified individual, and Accumulus supports him in all his endeavours.”

“I guess I just find him creepy, that's all,” said the other executive, whose name was Randall. “I'm sure he's fine at his job. I have no reason to doubt his dedication or capabilities. It's just, you know, his interpersonal skills…”

“So you would oppose his promotion?” asked the first executive, raising a greying and bushy, well-rehearsed right eyebrow.

“Oh, no—God, no! Not in the least,” said Randall.

“Good.”

“These are just my own, personal observations. We need someone we can work with.”

“He'll play ball,” said the first executive. “Besides, if not him, then who: a woman?” They both laughed uproariously at this. “At least Bruder knows the code. He'll be an old boy soon enough.”

“Very well,” said Randall.

“But, you do understand, I'll have to write you up for this,” said the first executive.

“For?”

“Expression of a prejudiced opinion. Nothing serious, just a formality, really; but it must be done. It may even be good for your career in the long run. You own the mistake, demonstrate personal growth. Learning opportunity, as they say. Take your penance and move on, with a nice, concrete example of a time you bettered yourself in your pocket to pull out at the next interview.”

“Thank you,” said Randall.

“Don't mention it. Friends look out for each other,” said the first executive.

“Actually, I think I'll report you, too.”

“Great. What for?”

“Nepotism. Handing out write-ups based on a criteria other than merit.”

“Oh, that's a good one. I don't think I've had one of those before. That will look very good in my file. It may even push me over the edge next time. Fingers respectfully crossed. Every dog has his day.”

“I love to help,” said Randall.

_____

To satiate his curiosity about Chad Bruder, Randall began a small info-gathering campaign. No one who currently worked—or had worked—under Bruder was willing (or able) to say anything at all about the man, but, as always, there were rumours: that Chad had been born without a larynx, that he came from a country (no one knew which) whose diet was almost exclusively nut-based, that he wasn't actually physically impaired and his silence was voluntary, that he worked a part-time job as a monk concurrently with his job for Accumulus Corporation, that he had no wife and children, that he had a wife and two children, that he had two wives and one child, that he had a husband, a common-law wife and three children, all of whom were adopted, and so on.

_____

At 5:00 p.m., Chad Bruder got up from his desk, exited his office and took the elevator down to the lobby. In the lobby, he took an exceedingly long drink from a water fountain. He went into a bathroom, and after about a quarter of an hour came out. He then walked to a small, organic grocery store, where the staff all knew him and always had his purchase—a box of mixed nuts—ready. They charged his credit card. He walked stiffly but with purpose. His face remained expressionless. Only his typewriter-eyes moved. Holding his nuts, he walked straight home.

_____

“Well, *I* happen to think he's kinda sexy,” said Darla, one of the numerous secretaries who worked in the Accumulus Corporation building. “Strong silent type, you know? And that salary!”

“What about that other guy, Randall?” asked her friend.

They were having coffee.

“Randall is a complete and total nerd. You may as well ask me why I don't wanna date Mike Wills.”

“Eww! Now that one's a real jellyfish!”

“And married!”

“Really? I always thought he was just making that up—you know, to seem normal. The kids, too.”

“Oh? Maybe he is.”

“That's what I think because, like, what kind of sponge would marry him? Plus he keeps talking about his family: how much he loves his wife, how great his kids are. I mean, who does that? Like, if you don't have anything interesting to say, just shut the fuck up.”

“Like Chad Bruder,” said Darla.

“Ohmygod, you slut—you really *do* have a thing for him, don't you?”

Darla blushed. (It was a skill she'd spent hours practicing in front of the mirror, with visible results.) “Stop! OK? He just seems like a real man. That's rare these days. Plus he's got that wild, animal magnetism.”

_____

Randall was at a dead end—*multiple* dead ends, in fact. (And a few in pure conjecture, too.) There was almost nothing substantive about Chad Bruder in the employment file. HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation. Sorry.”

_____

“I swear, he looks at me like I'm a freakin’ spreadsheet—*and I fucking love it*,” Darla told her friend. “I've made sure to walk past his office over and over, and if he looks up, it's with those penetrating, slightly lazy eyes of his. Chestnut brown. No change of expression whatsoever. It's like he has no interest in me at all. God, that makes me so hot.”

“Have you talked to him?”

Darla gave her a look. “Right,” said her friend: “He doesn't do that: talk.”

“So what do I do?”

“Well, maybe he's gay or something. You ever thought of that? It would explain a lot.”

“He is *not* gay. Don't even say that!”

“If you're so sure, then he's obviously just playing hard to get, so what you gotta do is: play harder. Just be careful. Don't risk your job. Office dating is a minefield. You probably have a policy about it.”

“Screw the job. I can be a secretary anywhere. Besides, if we end up together, I won't even need to work. It's an open secret he's about to be promoted. *Executive* position, which comes with *executive* pay and *executive* benefits. Hey,” she asked suddenly, “do you think maybe my tits are too small—is that the problem?”

“Honey, what matters is what *he* thinks. And to have an opinion, he's gotta see the goods.”

_____

Chad Bruder was sitting in his office, behind his desk, looking at a spreadsheet when Darla walked in. She was wearing a tight dress and carrying a card. “Morning, sir,” she said, striking a pose. Then she bent slowly forward, giving him a good view of her cleavage, before righting herself, fluttering her eyelashes and fixing her hair. She punctuated the performance with a subtle but evident *purr.*

The *purr* seemed to get Chad Bruder's attention, because it was if his body somehow rearranged, like a wave had passed through it. Darla smiled, bit her lower lip (painted the most garish shade of red imaginable) and placed the card she'd been holding on Chad Bruder's desk. Written on it, beside a lipstick stained kiss, was an address: hers. “If you're ever feeling lonely, or in the mood, or whatever,” she said seductively. “You can always call on me.”

She turned and, swinging her hips like she was the pendulum on an antique grandfather clock, sashayed out the door, into the hall, feeling so excited she almost swooned.

Chad Bruder looked at the card. He swallowed some mixed nuts. He called a committee, and the committee made a majority decision.

He tremored.

_____


Randall loitered in the Accumulus building lobby until Chad Bruder came down punctually in the elevator. He watched Chad Bruder drink water and waited while Chad Bruder spent fifteen minutes in the bathroom. Then, pulling on a baseball cap and an old vinyl windbreaker, he followed Chad Bruder out the doors. On the streets of Maninatinhat he kept what he felt was a safe distance. When Chad Bruder entered a grocery store, Randall leaned against a wall and chewed gum. When Chad Bruder came out holding a box of nuts, Randall followed him all the way home.

It turned out that hine was a long way from Maninatinhat, in a shabby apartment building all the way over in Rooklyn. (Not even Booklyn.) The walk was long, but Chad Bruder never slowed, which led Randall to conclude that despite whatever disability he had, Chad Bruder was in peak physical condition. Still, it was a little odd he hadn't taken a taxi, or public transit, thought Randall. And the building itself was well below what should have been Chad Bruder's standard. For a moment, Randall entertained the thought that the “foreign transplant” theory was correct and that Chad Bruder was working to support a large family overseas: working and saving so his loved ones had enough to eat, maybe a luxury, like chocolate or Coca Cola, once in a while. Then his natural cynicism chewed that theory up and spat it out.

When Chad Bruder entered the building, Randall stayed temporarily outside, across the street—before rushing in just in time to see the floor indicator above the elevator change. The elevator stopped on the fourth floor. He didn't know what unit Chad Bruder lived in yet, but he would find out. He had no doubt that he would find out more than anyone had ever known about Chad Bruder.

Excited, Randall exited the building and walked conspiratorially around its perimeter. The fourth floor was about level with some trees that were growing in what passed for the property’s communal green space. There was a rusted old playground, and black squirrels squeaked and barked and chased one another all around the trees and playground equipment, and even onto the building's jutting balconies. Randall knew he would never want to live here.

_____

It was late on a Saturday evening when the doorbell to Darla's apartment rang, and when she looked through the peephole in her door she saw it was Chad Bruder.

Her heart nearly went off-beat.

He was dressed in his office clothes, but Darla knew he often worked weekends, so that wasn't strange. More importantly, she didn't care. He must have been thinking about her all day. She fixed her breasts, quickly arranged her hair in the mirror and opened the apartment door, feigning total yet romantically welcome surprise. “Oh, Chad! I'm so—”

He pushed through her into the apartment (“Chad, wow—I'm…”) which she managed to turn into: her pulling him into her bedroom. Gosh, his hand feels *funny,* she thought. *Like a silk sock filled with noodles.* But then he was standing in the doorway, his shoulders so broad, his chestnut eyes so chestnut, and spreading her legs she invited him in. “I've been imagining this for a long, long time, Chad. Tell me—tell me you have too, if not with words, then—”

And he was on top of her.

*Yes,* she thought.

She closed her eyes and *purred* and his hand, caressing her neck, suddenly closed on it like a flesh-made vice. “Ch—ch… a—d,” she wheezed. Her eyes: still shut. She felt something cold and round and glass fall on her chest, roll down onto the mattress. She opened her eyes and Chad's gripping hand throttled her scream and he was missing an eye—one of his eyes was fucking gone, and in its place—in the gaping hole *where the eye should have been*, a squirrel was sticking its fucking head out, staring at her!

The squirrel squeezed through the hole and landed on her body, its little feet pitter-pattering across her bare, exposed skin, which crawled.

Another squirrel followed.

And another.

Until a dozen of them were out, were on and around her, and Chad Bruder's body was looking deflated, like an abandoned, human birthday balloon. But still he maintained his grip on her throat. She was trying to pry his fingers off. She managed it too—but before she could scream for help one of the squirrels that had emerged through Chad Bruder's empty eye socket crawled into her mouth. She was gagging. It was furry, moving. She threw up, but the squirrel was a living plug. The vomit sloshed around in her mouth, filling her. She started beating her hands against anything, everything: the bed, the squirrels, the rubbery husk that was Chad Bruder. She kicked out. She bit down. The squirrel in her mouth ***crunched,*** and she imagined breaking its little spine with her jaws, then bit her tongue. She tasted blood: hers and its. Now the other squirrels started scratching, attacking, biting her too, ripping tiny chunks of her flesh and eating it, morsel by morsel. The squirrel in her mouth was dead but she couldn't force it out. She was hyperventilating. She was having a panic attack. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't defend herself. There was less and less of her, and more and more squirrels, which ran madly around the bedroom, and she was dizzy, and she was hurting, and they were stabbing her with their sharp, nasty little teeth. Then a couple of them tore open her stomach and burrowed inside. She could feel them moving within her. And see them: small, roving distensions. They were eating her organs. Gnawing at her tendons. Until, finally, she was dead.

_____

When the deed was done and the cat-woman killed and cleaned almost to the bone, the committee reconvened and assessed the situation. “Good meat,” one squirrel said. “Yes, yes,” said another. “The threat is ended.” “We should expand our diet.” “Meat, meat, meat.” “What to do with remains?” “Deposit in Central Dark.” “Yes, yes.” “Is the man-suit damaged?” “No visible damage.” “Excellent.” “Yes, yes.” “Shift change?” “Home.” “Yes, yes.”

The squirrels re-entered Chad Bruder, disposed of their single fallen comrade, and walked purposefully home to Chad Bruder's apartment.

_____

“Shit,” cursed Randall.

He hadn't expected Chad Bruder back so soon. He tried to think of an excuse—any excuse—to allow him to get the fuck out of here, so he could show the photos and videos he'd taken of Chad Bruder's bizarre living conditions. The lack of any food but nuts. The dirt all over the floors. The complete lack of furniture. The scratches all over the walls. The door was open:* that was it!* The door was open so he'd walked in, just to see if everyone was all right. Chad Bruder probably wouldn't recognize him. A lot of people worked for Accumulus Corporation, and the executives were a bit of an Olympus from the rest. He would pretend to be a maintenance worker, *a concerned neighbour who heard something happening inside.* “Oh, hello—sorry, sorry: didn't mean to scare you,” he said as soon as Chad Bruder walked through the door. But Chad Bruder didn't look scared. He didn't look anything. “I was, uh, investigating a water leak. I'm a plumber, you see. Building management called me, and I heard some strange sounds coming from inside this unit. I thought, it must be the leak, so I, well, saw the door was open, knocked, of course, but there was no answer, so I just popped in to have a look. But, uh, looks like you, the owner, are home now, so I'll be going—”

Suffice it to say, Randall never stood a chance. He fought, even rather valiantly for a nerd, but in the end they overpowered him and had a bloody and merry feast, even letting their friends in through the balcony to partake of his raw, fresh human. Then they had shift change, and in the morning the new squirrel team went in to work as Chad Bruder.

“Awful what happened, eh?” A few people were gathered around a water cooler on the tenth floor of the Accumulus building.

“I heard they found both of them in Central Dark.”

“What remained of them…”

“Chewed up by wild animals. So bad they had to use their teeth to identify them.”

“Awful.”

“One hundred percent. A tragedy. So, how do you think they died?”

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation. Sorry.”

“I swear, he looks at me like I'm a freakin’ spreadsheet—*and I fucking love it*,” Darla told her friend. “I've made sure to walk past his office over and over, and if he looks up, it's with those penetrating, slightly lazy eyes of his. Chestnut brown. No change of expression whatsoever. It's like he has no interest in me at all. God, that makes me so hot.”

“Have you talked to him?”

Darla gave her a look. “Right,” said her friend: “He doesn't do that: talk.”

“So what do I do?”

“Well, maybe he's gay or something. You ever thought of that? It would explain a lot.”

“He is *not* gay. Don't even say that!”

“If you're so sure, then he's obviously just playing hard to get, so what you gotta do is: play harder. Just be careful. Don't risk your job. Office dating is a minefield. You probably have a policy about it.”

“Screw the job. I can be a secretary anywhere. Besides, if we end up together, I won't even need to work. It's an open secret he's about to be promoted. *Executive* position, which comes with *executive* pay and *executive* benefits. Hey,” she asked suddenly, “do you think maybe my tits are too small—is that the problem?”

“Honey, what matters is what *he* thinks. And to have an opinion, he's gotta see the goods.”

Chad Bruder was sitting in his office, behind his desk, looking at a spreadsheet when Darla walked in. She was wearing a tight dress and carrying a card. “Morning, sir,” she said, striking a pose. Then she bent slowly forward, giving him a good view of her cleavage, before righting herself, fluttering her eyelashes and fixing her hair. She punctuated the performance with a subtle but evident *purr.*

The *purr* seemed to get Chad Bruder's attention, because it was if his body somehow rearranged, like a wave had passed through it. Darla smiled, bit her lower lip (painted the most garish shade of red imaginable) and placed the card she'd been holding on Chad Bruder's desk. Written on it, beside a lipstick stained kiss, was an address: hers. “If you're ever feeling lonely, or in the mood, or whatever,” she said seductively. “You can always call on me.”

She turned and, swinging her hips like she was the pendulum on an antique grandfather clock, sashayed out the door, into the hall, feeling so excited she almost swooned.

Chad Bruder looked at the card. He swallowed some mixed nuts. He called a committee, and the committee made a majority decision.

He tremored.

_____


Randall loitered in the Accumulus building lobby until Chad Bruder came down punctually in the elevator. He watched Chad Bruder drink water and waited while Chad Bruder spent fifteen minutes in the bathroom. Then, pulling on a baseball cap and an old vinyl windbreaker, he followed Chad Bruder out the doors. On the streets of Maninatinhat he kept what he felt was a safe distance. When Chad Bruder entered a grocery store, Randall leaned against a wall and chewed gum. When Chad Bruder came out holding a box of nuts, Randall followed him all the way home.

It turned out that hine was a long way from Maninatinhat, in a shabby apartment building all the way over in Rooklyn. (Not even Booklyn.) The walk was long, but Chad Bruder never slowed, which led Randall to conclude that despite whatever disability he had, Chad Bruder was in peak physical condition. Still, it was a little odd he hadn't taken a taxi, or public transit, thought Randall. And the building itself was well below what should have been Chad Bruder's standard. For a moment, Randall entertained the thought that the “foreign transplant” theory was correct and that Chad Bruder was working to support a large family overseas: working and saving so his loved ones had enough to eat, maybe a luxury, like chocolate or Coca Cola, once in a while. Then his natural cynicism chewed that theory up and spat it out.

When Chad Bruder entered the building, Randall stayed temporarily outside, across the street—before rushing in just in time to see the floor indicator above the elevator change. The elevator stopped on the fourth floor. He didn't know what unit Chad Bruder lived in yet, but he would find out. He had no doubt that he would find out more than anyone had ever known about Chad Bruder.

Excited, Randall exited the building and walked conspiratorially around its perimeter. The fourth floor was about level with some trees that were growing in what passed for the property’s communal green space. There was a rusted old playground, and black squirrels squeaked and barked and chased one another all around the trees and playground equipment, and even onto the building's jutting balconies. Randall knew he would never want to live here.

It was late on a Saturday evening when the doorbell to Darla's apartment rang, and when she looked through the peephole in her door she saw it was Chad Bruder.

Her heart nearly went off-beat.

He was dressed in his office clothes, but Darla knew he often worked weekends, so that wasn't strange. More importantly, she didn't care. He must have been thinking about her all day. She fixed her breasts, quickly arranged her hair in the mirror and opened the apartment door, feigning total yet romantically welcome surprise. “Oh, Chad! I'm so—”

He pushed through her into the apartment (“Chad, wow—I'm…”) which she managed to turn into: her pulling him into her bedroom. Gosh, his hand feels *funny,* she thought. *Like a silk sock filled with noodles.* But then he was standing in the doorway, his shoulders so broad, his chestnut eyes so chestnut, and spreading her legs she invited him in. “I've been imagining this for a long, long time, Chad. Tell me—tell me you have too, if not with words, then—”

And he was on top of her.

*Yes,* she thought.

She closed her eyes and *purred* and his hand, caressing her neck, suddenly closed on it like a flesh-made vice. “Ch—ch… a—d,” she wheezed. Her eyes: still shut. She felt something cold and round and glass fall on her chest, roll down onto the mattress. She opened her eyes and Chad's gripping hand throttled her scream and he was missing an eye—one of his eyes was fucking gone, and in its place—in the gaping hole *where the eye should have been*, a squirrel was sticking its fucking head out, staring at her!

The squirrel squeezed through the hole and landed on her body, its little feet pitter-pattering across her bare, exposed skin, which crawled.

Another squirrel followed.

And another.

Until a dozen of them were out, were on and around her, and Chad Bruder's body was looking deflated, like an abandoned, human birthday balloon. But still he maintained his grip on her throat. She was trying to pry his fingers off. She managed it too—but before she could scream for help one of the squirrels that had emerged through Chad Bruder's empty eye socket crawled into her mouth. She was gagging. It was furry, moving. She threw up, but the squirrel was a living plug. The vomit sloshed around in her mouth, filling her. She started beating her hands against anything, everything: the bed, the squirrels, the rubbery husk that was Chad Bruder. She kicked out. She bit down. The squirrel in her mouth ***crunched,*** and she imagined breaking its little spine with her jaws, then bit her tongue. She tasted blood: hers and its. Now the other squirrels started scratching, attacking, biting her too, ripping tiny chunks of her flesh and eating it, morsel by morsel. The squirrel in her mouth was dead but she couldn't force it out. She was hyperventilating. She was having a panic attack. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't defend herself. There was less and less of her, and more and more squirrels, which ran madly around the bedroom, and she was dizzy, and she was hurting, and they were stabbing her with their sharp, nasty little teeth. Then a couple of them tore open her stomach and burrowed inside. She could feel them moving within her. And see them: small, roving distensions. They were eating her organs. Gnawing at her tendons. Until, finally, she was dead.

_____

When the deed was done and the cat-woman killed and cleaned almost to the bone, the committee reconvened and assessed the situation. “Good meat,” one squirrel said. “Yes, yes,” said another. “The threat is ended.” “We should expand our diet.” “Meat, meat, meat.” “What to do with remains?” “Deposit in Central Dark.” “Yes, yes.” “Is the man-suit damaged?” “No visible damage.” “Excellent.” “Yes, yes.” “Shift change?” “Home.” “Yes, yes.”

The squirrels re-entered Chad Bruder, disposed of their single fallen comrade, and walked purposefully home to Chad Bruder's apartment.

_____

“Shit,” cursed Randall.

He hadn't expected Chad Bruder back so soon. He tried to think of an excuse—any excuse—to allow him to get the fuck out of here, so he could show the photos and videos he'd taken of Chad Bruder's bizarre living conditions. The lack of any food but nuts. The dirt all over the floors. The complete lack of furniture. The scratches all over the walls. The door was open:* that was it!* The door was open so he'd walked in, just to see if everyone was all right. Chad Bruder probably wouldn't recognize him. A lot of people worked for Accumulus Corporation, and the executives were a bit of an Olympus from the rest. He would pretend to be a maintenance worker, *a concerned neighbour who heard something happening inside.* “Oh, hello—sorry, sorry: didn't mean to scare you,” he said as soon as Chad Bruder walked through the door. But Chad Bruder didn't look scared. He didn't look anything. “I was, uh, investigating a water leak. I'm a plumber, you see. Building management called me, and I heard some strange sounds coming from inside this unit. I thought, it must be the leak, so I, well, saw the door was open, knocked, of course, but there was no answer, so I just popped in to have a look. But, uh, looks like you, the owner, are home now, so I'll be going—”

Suffice it to say, Randall never stood a chance. He fought, even rather valiantly for a nerd, but in the end they overpowered him and had a bloody and merry feast, even letting their friends in through the balcony to partake of his raw, fresh human. Then they had shift change, and in the morning the new squirrel team went in to work as Chad Bruder.

_____

“Awful what happened, eh?” A few people were gathered around a water cooler on the tenth floor of the Accumulus building.

“I heard they found both of them in Central Dark.”

“What remained of them…”

“Chewed up by wild animals. So bad they had to use their teeth to identify them.”

“Awful.”

“One hundred percent. A tragedy. So, how do you think they died?”

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

Chad Bruder was holding a printed sheet of paper.

He held it out.

One of the water cooler people took it. The rest moved closer to look at it. The paper said, in printed capital letters: THEY WERE HAVING AFFAIR. HE KILLED HER SHOT SELF. IF AGREE PLEASE SMILE.

Everyone smiled, and, for the first time anyone could remember, Chad Bruder smiled too.

“He's going to make a fine executive,” one of the water cooler people said once Chad Bruder had left. “His theory makes a lot of sense too.” “I didn't even know either of them was married.” “Me neither.” “Just goes to show you how you never really know anyone.” “The lengths some people will go to, eh?” “Disgusting.” “Reprehensible.” “Say, weren't there supposed to be free donuts in the lunchroom today?” “Oh, right!”

On the day Chad Bruder was officially promoted from middle-manager to Junior Executive, Mike Wills leapt to his death from the top floor of the Accumulus building. His wife had declared she was divorcing him and taking their kids to Lost Angeles to live with her mother. “I just can't live with a jellyfish like you,” she’d told him.

Sadly, Mike Wills’ act of quiet desperation was altogether too quiet, for he had jumped inopportunely, coincident with Chad Bruder's celebratory lunch, which meant nobody saw him fall. Moreover, he landed on a pile of old mattresses—the soiled by-products of a recent Executives Party—that had been left out for the garbage collectors to pick up. But the garbage collectors were on strike, so no one picked them up for two weeks. The mattresses, which had dampened the sound of Mike Wills’ impact, had also initially saved his life. However, his body was badly broken by the fall, and at some point between that day and the day the garbage *was* collected, he expired. Voiceless and in agony. When it came time to identify the body, nobody could quite remember his name or if he had even worked there. When the police finally reached his estranged wife with the news, she told them she couldn't talk because she'd taken up surfing.",1,1764726025.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False
1pcr3se,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pcr3se/life_is_nuts_the_chad_bruder_story/,Life Is Nuts: The Chad Bruder Story,"Mike Wills knocked weakly on his manager’s office door. The manager, Chad Bruder, rotated on his swivel chair to look at Mike. He didn't say anything. Mike Wills walked in and sat down on a chair across from Chad Bruder's desk. “So, uh, Chad—Mr Bruder—sir, I’ve been thinking, which I hope you don't mind, but I've been thinking about the work I do for the company, and how much I'm paid. As you know, I have two kids, a third on the way, and, sir, if you'll let me be frank…”

Chad Bruder listened without speaking. Not a single *mhm* or head nod. Even his breathing was controlled, professionally imperceptible. Only his eyes moved, focussing on Mike Wills’ face, then slowly drifting away—before returning with a sudden jump, as if they were a typewriter. Chad Bruder didn't open his mouth or lick his lips. He didn't even blink. His gaze was razorlike. His palms, resting on the armrests of his office chair, upturned as if he were meditating.

Mike Wills kept talking, increasingly in circles, tripping over his words, starting to sweat, misremembering his argument, messing up its expression until, unable to take the tension anymore, he abruptly finished by thanking Chad Bruder for his time and going off script: “Actually, I see it now. The company really does pay me what I'm worth. That's what it's about. It's not about, uh, how much I need but how valuable I am to the company. There are others more valuable, and they get paid more, and if—if I want to make as much as they do, which I don't—at the moment, I don't—I need to work as much and as well as they do. Even the fact I have kids, that's a liability. It's a selfish choice. I understand that, Mr Bruder, sir.” He was fishing for a reaction: something, but Chad Bruder was not forthcoming. His drifting eyes carriage returned. Mike Wills went on, “So, I guess I came here to ask for a raise, but what I've gotten from you is infinitely more valuable: knowledge, a better, less emotional, more mature perspective on the world and my own self-worth and place in it. I'm grateful for that. Grateful that you let me talk it out. No judgement. No anger. You're a patient man, Mr Gruder, sir. And an excellent manager. Thank you. Thank you!” And, with that, Mike Wills stood up, bowed awkwardly while backing away towards the door, and left Chad Bruder's office to return to his cubicle.

Chad Bruder rotated on his swivel chair to look at his computer screen. Spreadsheets were on it. On the desk, beside the computer, sat a plastic box filled with assorted nuts. Chad Bruder lifted an arm, lowered it over the box, closed his hands on a selection of the nuts and lifted those to his mouth. These he swallowed without chewing.

The clock read 1:15 p.m.

The Accumulus Corporation building thrummed with money-making.

In a boardroom:

“Bruder?” an executive said. “Why, he's one of our finest men. His teams always excel in productivity. He's a very capable middle-manager.”

“But does he ever, you know: talk?”

The executive dropped his voice. “Listen, just between the two of us, he was a diversity hire. Disability, and not the visible kind. He's obviously not a Grade-A Retard, with the eyes and the *arf-arf-arf*’ing. As far as I know, no one really does know what’s ‘wrong’ with him. Not that anything *is* ‘wrong.’ He's just different—in some way—that no one’s privy to know. But he is a fully capable and dignified individual, and Accumulus supports him in all his endeavours.”

“I guess I just find him creepy, that's all,” said the other executive, whose name was Randall. “I'm sure he's fine at his job. I have no reason to doubt his dedication or capabilities. It's just, you know, his interpersonal skills…”

“So you would oppose his promotion?” asked the first executive, raising a greying and bushy, well-rehearsed right eyebrow.

“Oh, no—God, no! Not in the least,” said Randall.

“Good.”

“These are just my own, personal observations. We need someone we can work with.”

“He'll play ball,” said the first executive. “Besides, if not him, then who: a woman?” They both laughed uproariously at this. “At least Bruder knows the code. He'll be an old boy soon enough.”

“Very well,” said Randall.

“But, you do understand, I'll have to write you up for this,” said the first executive.

“For?”

“Expression of a prejudiced opinion. Nothing serious, just a formality, really; but it must be done. It may even be good for your career in the long run. You own the mistake, demonstrate personal growth. Learning opportunity, as they say. Take your penance and move on, with a nice, concrete example of a time you bettered yourself in your pocket to pull out at the next interview.”

“Thank you,” said Randall.

“Don't mention it. Friends look out for each other,” said the first executive.

“Actually, I think I'll report you, too.”

“Great. What for?”

“Nepotism. Handing out write-ups based on a criteria other than merit.”

“Oh, that's a good one. I don't think I've had one of those before. That will look very good in my file. It may even push me over the edge next time. Fingers respectfully crossed. Every dog has his day.”

“I love to help,” said Randall.

_____

To satiate his curiosity about Chad Bruder, Randall began a small info-gathering campaign. No one who currently worked—or had worked—under Bruder was willing (or able) to say anything at all about the man, but, as always, there were rumours: that Chad had been born without a larynx, that he came from a country (no one knew which) whose diet was almost exclusively nut-based, that he wasn't actually physically impaired and his silence was voluntary, that he worked a part-time job as a monk concurrently with his job for Accumulus Corporation, that he had no wife and children, that he had a wife and two children, that he had two wives and one child, that he had a husband, a common-law wife and three children, all of whom were adopted, and so on.

_____

At 5:00 p.m., Chad Bruder got up from his desk, exited his office and took the elevator down to the lobby. In the lobby, he took an exceedingly long drink from a water fountain. He went into a bathroom, and after about a quarter of an hour came out. He then walked to a small, organic grocery store, where the staff all knew him and always had his purchase—a box of mixed nuts—ready. They charged his credit card. He walked stiffly but with purpose. His face remained expressionless. Only his typewriter-eyes moved. Holding his nuts, he walked straight home.

_____

“Well, *I* happen to think he's kinda sexy,” said Darla, one of the numerous secretaries who worked in the Accumulus Corporation building. “Strong silent type, you know? And that salary!”

“What about that other guy, Randall?” asked her friend.

They were having coffee.

“Randall is a complete and total nerd. You may as well ask me why I don't wanna date Mike Wills.”

“Eww! Now that one's a real jellyfish!”

“And married!”

“Really? I always thought he was just making that up—you know, to seem normal. The kids, too.”

“Oh? Maybe he is.”

“That's what I think because, like, what kind of sponge would marry him? Plus he keeps talking about his family: how much he loves his wife, how great his kids are. I mean, who does that? Like, if you don't have anything interesting to say, just shut the fuck up.”

“Like Chad Bruder,” said Darla.

“Ohmygod, you slut—you really *do* have a thing for him, don't you?”

Darla blushed. (It was a skill she'd spent hours practicing in front of the mirror, with visible results.) “Stop! OK? He just seems like a real man. That's rare these days. Plus he's got that wild, animal magnetism.”

Randall was at a dead end—*multiple* dead ends, in fact. (And a few in pure conjecture, too.) There was almost nothing substantive about Chad Bruder in the employment file. HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation.

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

Chad Bruder was holding a printed sheet of paper.

He held it out.

One of the water cooler people took it. The rest moved closer to look at it. The paper said, in printed capital letters: THEY WERE HAVING AFFAIR. HE KILLED HER SHOT SELF. IF AGREE PLEASE SMILE.

Everyone smiled, and, for the first time anyone could remember, Chad Bruder smiled too.

“He's going to make a fine executive,” one of the water cooler people said once Chad Bruder had left. “His theory makes a lot of sense too.” “I didn't even know either of them was married.” “Me neither.” “Just goes to show you how you never really know anyone.” “The lengths some people will go to, eh?” “Disgusting.” “Reprehensible.” “Say, weren't there supposed to be free donuts in the lunchroom today?” “Oh, right!”

On the day Chad Bruder was officially promoted from middle-manager to Junior Executive, Mike Wills leapt to his death from the top floor of the Accumulus building. His wife had declared she was divorcing him and taking their kids to Lost Angeles to live with her mother. “I just can't live with a jellyfish like you,” she’d told him.

Sadly, Mike Wills’ act of quiet desperation was altogether too quiet, for he had jumped inopportunely, coincident with Chad Bruder's celebratory lunch, which meant nobody saw him fall. Moreover, he landed on a pile of old mattresses—the soiled by-products of a recent Executives Party—that had been left out for the garbage collectors to pick up. But the garbage collectors were on strike, so no one picked them up for two weeks. The mattresses, which had dampened the sound of Mike Wills’ impact, had also initially saved his life. However, his body was badly broken by the fall, and at some point between that day and the day the garbage *was* collected, he expired. Voiceless and in agony. When it came time to identify the body, nobody could quite remember his name or if he had even worked there.

I finally booked the flight and flew down for a 4-day trip. I am a very laid-back, mellow kinda person in my mid-30s.

Sat in the metro for hours on different lines, just observing New Yorkers (I hope not in a creepy way lol), stopping anywhere I wanted to eat or grab a coffee. Just tried to live a day-to-day New Yorker life.

Since I came back, I can't stop daydreaming of moving to NYC and living in Brooklyn and working at Columbia University (I work at McGill in Montreal lol, and Columbia has a beautiful campus). This past week at work, I stopped caring about my job, and all I think of is how to move to NYC and find a job.

1pcr2kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1pcr2kr/life_is_nuts_the_chad_bruder_story/,Life Is Nuts: The Chad Bruder Story,"Mike Wills knocked weakly on his manager’s office door. The manager, Chad Bruder, rotated on his swivel chair to look at Mike. He didn't say anything. Mike Wills walked in and sat down on a chair across from Chad Bruder's desk. “So, uh, Chad—Mr Bruder—sir, I’ve been thinking, which I hope you don't mind, but I've been thinking about the work I do for the company, and how much I'm paid. As you know, I have two kids, a third on the way, and, sir, if you'll let me be frank…”

Chad Bruder listened without speaking. Not a single *mhm* or head nod. Even his breathing was controlled, professionally imperceptible. Only his eyes moved, focussing on Mike Wills’ face, then slowly drifting away—before returning with a sudden jump, as if they were a typewriter. Chad Bruder didn't open his mouth or lick his lips. He didn't even blink. His gaze was razorlike. His palms, resting on the armrests of his office chair, upturned as if he were meditating.

Mike Wills kept talking, increasingly in circles, tripping over his words, starting to sweat, misremembering his argument, messing up its expression until, unable to take the tension anymore, he abruptly finished by thanking Chad Bruder for his time and going off script: “Actually, I see it now. The company really does pay me what I'm worth. That's what it's about. It's not about, uh, how much I need but how valuable I am to the company. There are others more valuable, and they get paid more, and if—if I want to make as much as they do, which I don't—at the moment, I don't—I need to work as much and as well as they do. Even the fact I have kids, that's a liability. It's a selfish choice. I understand that, Mr Bruder, sir.” He was fishing for a reaction: something, but Chad Bruder was not forthcoming. His drifting eyes carriage returned. Mike Wills went on, “So, I guess I came here to ask for a raise, but what I've gotten from you is infinitely more valuable: knowledge, a better, less emotional, more mature perspective on the world and my own self-worth and place in it. I'm grateful for that. Grateful that you let me talk it out. No judgement. No anger. You're a patient man, Mr Gruder, sir. And an excellent manager. Thank you. Thank you!” And, with that, Mike Wills stood up, bowed awkwardly while backing away towards the door, and left Chad Bruder's office to return to his cubicle.

Chad Bruder rotated on his swivel chair to look at his computer screen. Spreadsheets were on it. On the desk, beside the computer, sat a plastic box filled with assorted nuts. Chad Bruder lifted an arm, lowered it over the box, closed his hands on a selection of the nuts and lifted those to his mouth. These he swallowed without chewing.

The clock read 1:15 p.m.

The Accumulus Corporation building thrummed with money-making.

In a boardroom:

“Bruder?” an executive said. “Why, he's one of our finest men. His teams always excel in productivity. He's a very capable middle-manager.”

“But does he ever, you know: talk?”

The executive dropped his voice. “Listen, just between the two of us, he was a diversity hire. Disability, and not the visible kind. He's obviously not a Grade-A Retard, with the eyes and the *arf-arf-arf*’ing. As far as I know, no one really does know what’s ‘wrong’ with him. Not that anything *is* ‘wrong.’ He's just different—in some way—that no one’s privy to know. But he is a fully capable and dignified individual, and Accumulus supports him in all his endeavours.”

“I guess I just find him creepy, that's all,” said the other executive, whose name was Randall. “I'm sure he's fine at his job. I have no reason to doubt his dedication or capabilities. It's just, you know, his interpersonal skills…”

“So you would oppose his promotion?” asked the first executive, raising a greying and bushy, well-rehearsed right eyebrow.

“Oh, no—God, no! Not in the least,” said Randall.

“Good.”

“These are just my own, personal observations. We need someone we can work with.”

“He'll play ball,” said the first executive. “Besides, if not him, then who: a woman?” They both laughed uproariously at this. “At least Bruder knows the code. He'll be an old boy soon enough.”

“Very well,” said Randall.

“But, you do understand, I'll have to write you up for this,” said the first executive.

“For?”

“Expression of a prejudiced opinion. Nothing serious, just a formality, really; but it must be done. It may even be good for your career in the long run. You own the mistake, demonstrate personal growth. Learning opportunity, as they say. Take your penance and move on, with a nice, concrete example of a time you bettered yourself in your pocket to pull out at the next interview.”

“Thank you,” said Randall.

“Don't mention it. Friends look out for each other,” said the first executive.

“Actually, I think I'll report you, too.”

“Great. What for?”

“Nepotism. Handing out write-ups based on a criteria other than merit.”

“Oh, that's a good one. I don't think I've had one of those before. That will look very good in my file. It may even push me over the edge next time. Fingers respectfully crossed. Every dog has his day.”

“I love to help,” said Randall.

_____

To satiate his curiosity about Chad Bruder, Randall began a small info-gathering campaign. No one who currently worked—or had worked—under Bruder was willing (or able) to say anything at all about the man, but, as always, there were rumours: that Chad had been born without a larynx, that he came from a country (no one knew which) whose diet was almost exclusively nut-based, that he wasn't actually physically impaired and his silence was voluntary, that he worked a part-time job as a monk concurrently with his job for Accumulus Corporation, that he had no wife and children, that he had a wife and two children, that he had two wives and one child, that he had a husband, a common-law wife and three children, all of whom were adopted, and so on.

_____

At 5:00 p.m., Chad Bruder got up from his desk, exited his office and took the elevator down to the lobby. In the lobby, he took an exceedingly long drink from a water fountain. He went into a bathroom, and after about a quarter of an hour came out. He then walked to a small, organic grocery store, where the staff all knew him and always had his purchase—a box of mixed nuts—ready. They charged his credit card. He walked stiffly but with purpose. His face remained expressionless. Only his typewriter-eyes moved. Holding his nuts, he walked straight home.

_____

“Well, *I* happen to think he's kinda sexy,” said Darla, one of the numerous secretaries who worked in the Accumulus Corporation building. “Strong silent type, you know? And that salary!”

“What about that other guy, Randall?” asked her friend.

They were having coffee.

“Randall is a complete and total nerd. You may as well ask me why I don't wanna date Mike Wills.”

“Eww! Now that one's a real jellyfish!”

“And married!”

“Really? I always thought he was just making that up—you know, to seem normal. The kids, too.”

“Oh? Maybe he is.”

“That's what I think because, like, what kind of sponge would marry him? Plus he keeps talking about his family: how much he loves his wife, how great his kids are. I mean, who does that? Like, if you don't have anything interesting to say, just shut the fuck up.”

“Like Chad Bruder,” said Darla.

“Ohmygod, you slut—you really *do* have a thing for him, don't you?”

Darla blushed. (It was a skill she'd spent hours practicing in front of the mirror, with visible results.) “Stop! OK? He just seems like a real man. That's rare these days. Plus he's got that wild, animal magnetism.”

_____

Randall was at a dead end—*multiple* dead ends, in fact. (And a few in pure conjecture, too.) There was almost nothing substantive about Chad Bruder in the employment file. HR didn't even have his address or home phone number. “I thought everyone had to provide those things,” he'd told the HR rep. “Nope,” she'd answered. “Everyone *is* asked for them, and almost everyone provides them, but it's purely voluntary.” “Well, can I have mine deleted then?” he'd asked in exasperation. “Afraid not.” “Why not?” “Systems limitation. Sorry.”

_____

“I swear, he looks at me like I'm a freakin’ spreadsheet—*and I fucking love it*,” Darla told her friend. “I've made sure to walk past his office over and over, and if he looks up, it's with those penetrating, slightly lazy eyes of his. Chestnut brown. No change of expression whatsoever. It's like he has no interest in me at all. God, that makes me so hot.”

“Have you talked to him?”

Darla gave her a look. “Right,” said her friend: “He doesn't do that: talk.”

“So what do I do?”

“Well, maybe he's gay or something. You ever thought of that? It would explain a lot.”

“He is *not* gay. Don't even say that!”

“If you're so sure, then he's obviously just playing hard to get, so what you gotta do is: play harder. Just be careful. Don't risk your job. Office dating is a minefield. You probably have a policy about it.”

“Screw the job. I can be a secretary anywhere. Besides, if we end up together, I won't even need to work. It's an open secret he's about to be promoted. *Executive* position, which comes with *executive* pay and *executive* benefits. Hey,” she asked suddenly, “do you think maybe my tits are too small—is that the problem?”

“Honey, what matters is what *he* thinks. And to have an opinion, he's gotta see the goods.”

_____

Chad Bruder was sitting in his office, behind his desk, looking at a spreadsheet when Darla walked in. She was wearing a tight dress and carrying a card. “Morning, sir,” she said, striking a pose. Then she bent slowly forward, giving him a good view of her cleavage, before righting herself, fluttering her eyelashes and fixing her hair. She punctuated the performance with a subtle but evident *purr.*

The *purr* seemed to get Chad Bruder's attention, because it was if his body somehow rearranged, like a wave had passed through it. Darla smiled, bit her lower lip (painted the most garish shade of red imaginable) and placed the card she'd been holding on Chad Bruder's desk. Written on it, beside a lipstick stained kiss, was an address: hers. “If you're ever feeling lonely, or in the mood, or whatever,” she said seductively. “You can always call on me.”

She turned and, swinging her hips like she was the pendulum on an antique grandfather clock, sashayed out the door, into the hall, feeling so excited she almost swooned.

Chad Bruder looked at the card. He swallowed some mixed nuts. He called a committee, and the committee made a majority decision.

He tremored.

_____


Randall loitered in the Accumulus building lobby until Chad Bruder came down punctually in the elevator. He watched Chad Bruder drink water and waited while Chad Bruder spent fifteen minutes in the bathroom. Then, pulling on a baseball cap and an old vinyl windbreaker, he followed Chad Bruder out the doors. On the streets of Maninatinhat he kept what he felt was a safe distance. When Chad Bruder entered a grocery store, Randall leaned against a wall and chewed gum. When Chad Bruder came out holding a box of nuts, Randall followed him all the way home.

It turned out that hine was a long way from Maninatinhat, in a shabby apartment building all the way over in Rooklyn. (Not even Booklyn.) The walk was long, but Chad Bruder never slowed, which led Randall to conclude that despite whatever disability he had, Chad Bruder was in peak physical condition. Still, it was a little odd he hadn't taken a taxi, or public transit, thought Randall. And the building itself was well below what should have been Chad Bruder's standard. For a moment, Randall entertained the thought that the “foreign transplant” theory was correct and that Chad Bruder was working to support a large family overseas: working and saving so his loved ones had enough to eat, maybe a luxury, like chocolate or Coca Cola, once in a while. Then his natural cynicism chewed that theory up and spat it out.

When Chad Bruder entered the building, Randall stayed temporarily outside, across the street—before rushing in just in time to see the floor indicator above the elevator change. The elevator stopped on the fourth floor. He didn't know what unit Chad Bruder lived in yet, but he would find out. He had no doubt that he would find out more than anyone had ever known about Chad Bruder.

Excited, Randall exited the building and walked conspiratorially around its perimeter. The fourth floor was about level with some trees that were growing in what passed for the property’s communal green space. There was a rusted old playground, and black squirrels squeaked and barked and chased one another all around the trees and playground equipment, and even onto the building's jutting balconies. Randall knew he would never want to live here.

_____

It was late on a Saturday evening when the doorbell to Darla's apartment rang, and when she looked through the peephole in her door she saw it was Chad Bruder.

Her heart nearly went off-beat.

He was dressed in his office clothes, but Darla knew he often worked weekends, so that wasn't strange. More importantly, she didn't care. He must have been thinking about her all day. She fixed her breasts, quickly arranged her hair in the mirror and opened the apartment door, feigning total yet romantically welcome surprise. “Oh, Chad! I'm so—”

He pushed through her into the apartment (“Chad, wow—I'm…”) which she managed to turn into: her pulling him into her bedroom. Gosh, his hand feels *funny,* she thought. *Like a silk sock filled with noodles.* But then he was standing in the doorway, his shoulders so broad, his chestnut eyes so chestnut, and spreading her legs she invited him in. “I've been imagining this for a long, long time, Chad. Tell me—tell me you have too, if not with words, then—”

And he was on top of her.

*Yes,* she thought.

She closed her eyes and *purred* and his hand, caressing her neck, suddenly closed on it like a flesh-made vice. “Ch—ch… a—d,” she wheezed. Her eyes: still shut. She felt something cold and round and glass fall on her chest, roll down onto the mattress. She opened her eyes and Chad's gripping hand throttled her scream and he was missing an eye—one of his eyes was fucking gone, and in its place—in the gaping hole *where the eye should have been*, a squirrel was sticking its fucking head out, staring at her!

The squirrel squeezed through the hole and landed on her body, its little feet pitter-pattering across her bare, exposed skin, which crawled.

Another squirrel followed.

And another.

Until a dozen of them were out, were on and around her, and Chad Bruder's body was looking deflated, like an abandoned, human birthday balloon. But still he maintained his grip on her throat. She was trying to pry his fingers off. She managed it too—but before she could scream for help one of the squirrels that had emerged through Chad Bruder's empty eye socket crawled into her mouth. She was gagging. It was furry, moving. She threw up, but the squirrel was a living plug. The vomit sloshed around in her mouth, filling her. She started beating her hands against anything, everything: the bed, the squirrels, the rubbery husk that was Chad Bruder. She kicked out. She bit down. The squirrel in her mouth ***crunched,*** and she imagined breaking its little spine with her jaws, then bit her tongue. She tasted blood: hers and its. Now the other squirrels started scratching, attacking, biting her too, ripping tiny chunks of her flesh and eating it, morsel by morsel. The squirrel in her mouth was dead but she couldn't force it out. She was hyperventilating. She was having a panic attack. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't defend herself. There was less and less of her, and more and more squirrels, which ran madly around the bedroom, and she was dizzy, and she was hurting, and they were stabbing her with their sharp, nasty little teeth. Then a couple of them tore open her stomach and burrowed inside. She could feel them moving within her. And see them: small, roving distensions. They were eating her organs. Gnawing at her tendons. Until, finally, she was dead.

_____

When the deed was done and the cat-woman killed and cleaned almost to the bone, the committee reconvened and assessed the situation. “Good meat,” one squirrel said. “Yes, yes,” said another. “The threat is ended.” “We should expand our diet.” “Meat, meat, meat.” “What to do with remains?” “Deposit in Central Dark.” “Yes, yes.” “Is the man-suit damaged?” “No visible damage.” “Excellent.” “Yes, yes.” “Shift change?” “Home.” “Yes, yes.”

The squirrels re-entered Chad Bruder, disposed of their single fallen comrade, and walked purposefully home to Chad Bruder's apartment.

_____

“Shit,” cursed Randall.

He hadn't expected Chad Bruder back so soon. He tried to think of an excuse—any excuse—to allow him to get the fuck out of here, so he could show the photos and videos he'd taken of Chad Bruder's bizarre living conditions. The lack of any food but nuts. The dirt all over the floors. The complete lack of furniture. The scratches all over the walls. The door was open:* that was it!* The door was open so he'd walked in, just to see if everyone was all right. Chad Bruder probably wouldn't recognize him. A lot of people worked for Accumulus Corporation, and the executives were a bit of an Olympus from the rest. He would pretend to be a maintenance worker, *a concerned neighbour who heard something happening inside.* “Oh, hello—sorry, sorry: didn't mean to scare you,” he said as soon as Chad Bruder walked through the door. But Chad Bruder didn't look scared. He didn't look anything. “I was, uh, investigating a water leak. I'm a plumber, you see. Building management called me, and I heard some strange sounds coming from inside this unit. I thought, it must be the leak, so I, well, saw the door was open, knocked, of course, but there was no answer, so I just popped in to have a look. But, uh, looks like you, the owner, are home now, so I'll be going—”

Suffice it to say, Randall never stood a chance. He fought, even rather valiantly for a nerd, but in the end they overpowered him and had a bloody and merry feast, even letting their friends in through the balcony to partake of his raw, fresh human. Then they had shift change, and in the morning the new squirrel team went in to work as Chad Bruder.

_____

“Awful what happened, eh?” A few people were gathered around a water cooler on the tenth floor of the Accumulus building.

“I heard they found both of them in Central Dark.”

“What remained of them…”

“Chewed up by wild animals. So bad they had to use their teeth to identify them.”

“Awful.”

“One hundred percent. A tragedy. So, how do you think they died?”

Just then a shadow shrouded the water cooler and everyone around it. The people talking shut up and looked up. Chad Bruder was standing in the doorway, blocking the light from the hallway. In the copy room next door, printers and fax machines clicked, buzzed and whined. “Oh, Mr Bruder, why—hello,” said the bravest of the group.

Chad Bruder was holding a printed sheet of paper.

Sharing my experience with a drink to see if it's just me.

Recently had the Celsius live fit in cherry coke with 200mg caffeine. I have a 4 espresso coffee and a 160-200mg drink almost everyday and have done this on and off for months. Have def seen chest pain progressing and stopping based on how much I have. Lately, the pain is more like a tightness and my breathing gets shallow a few hours after drinking (around when it wears off) and sometimes after drinking. I don't drink them quickly, an energy drink can last me all day.

Anyways, I drank about half my can and I was just sitting down. Then I get what feels like a lump right under my heart. I lie down and can feel my heartbeat. When I try to get up I'm dizzy, hands are shaking and sweating and I want to throw up. Never had that happen and my heart rate wasn""t even high but it was beating strongly. I kinda feel like I had some sort of affect and it was made stronger by anxiety but I think the Celsius live fit may have another ingredient that caused it too. I literally had half in a two hour span. Worst part is I bought a whole pack for the week. I'm feeling better two hours later but don't feel like my body is back to normal yet.

A former colleague said she was having trouble finding freelance work (we're in journalism), and I asked if she would like to work temporarily.

The first week she was on duty (remotely), I asked at the end of the day, where are those two stories you edited? I needed her to share the links (which I've repeated several times). Her response: When can I send you an invoice?

We are now three weeks in. She is still struggling with tech issues (we're both in our 60s) so she took the initiative to come to the office to get some assistance (good). She is still not sharing links with me, though she can see this is how the other freelancers work. At this point, I'm simply thinking, when can I cut this woman's hours? I took a short break for lunch, and there she was in the lunch room asking me how to use the office coffee machine. I'm doing my best not to be overwhelmed, and I can't even get a quiet lunch!

Needless to say time around a woman has been nonexistent. After years of attempting to date and getting burned out with the nonsense games, fakes, or just engaging with others really not seeking an irl friendship or dynamic. I simply put finding a partner in the bag of pipe dreams and just let it go. Yet the other day , while taking my child out for dinner, I had this random conversation with a lady who was also waiting to be seated. It was a friendly conversation, that I didn’t really pay any attention to, beyond small talk. However when I spoke of it to my work friend, I was told , I completely missed all the signs, as this lady and I spoke , she would continuously grab my arm soft and gentle as if she was feeling how strong my arms where, her constant smile from ear to ear, or repeatedly making comments as to where she would be located on certain days of the week , like a restaurant, coffee shop, etc. repeated comments on how she’s single etc. How after we were seated for dinner across the room from each other , her constant stare my way as her friends were trying to talk to her over dinner etc. I never really paid it attention at the time as I’ve just been so use to the constant rejection us single dads receive or the lack of interest of woman wanting a full time single dad for dating. I just didn’t think anything about it . Yet my guy friend at work told me her actions were all signs she was interested in me. But I just didn’t feel it, or maybe I just didn’t believe it anymore in love, romance and fairy tails. So now he has me constantly wondering , did I miss the so called One? I don’t have any female friends so don’t have any other perspective than his. It’s so frustrating trying to make a connection , I wonder if it will take a cave man approach of being bonked on the head and dragged off to get my attention or to feel like your actually wanted.

The city looked almost staged that afternoon. Set up specifically by Mother nature for the best Instagram shots. 

The sun was warm, a slow breeze barely moved the leaves. Tables were set out under striped umbrellas. The kind of weather cafés used for their website banners, except this wasn’t a photoshoot. It was just a day that made people feel like all the struggle and bullshit might actually be worth it. 

A pianist played in the corner of an alfresco area, quiet enough not to compete with conversation, but their presence also loud enough to declare that this was a very fine establishment. Someone’s hypo-allergenic dog slept in the shade with its tongue hanging out. Couples leaned close over wine glasses, touching thighs discreetly under tables, thinking they were the first in the world to do so.

 The ambience was only broken by a man walking past, coffee in one hand, phone in the other. His head down, rushing to catch the next tram to work; his utilitarian jacket and bag a stark contrast from the well curated looks within. His phone blared a cyclone warning from his home town, evacuation orders scrolling past his thumb. The sound of the phone eliciting sideways glances at the uncouth behaviour from bothered couples.

 It was the kind of day people would remember right up until the moment they stopped remembering anything at all.

Outside another Italian restaurant, a couple sat at a little wrought-iron table. She wore a sundress with lemons on it, perfectly matching the café’s bright tablecloths. Some choices felt spontaneous until you remembered the hours people spent scrolling blogs and feeds, planning the version of themselves they wanted to be seen. He had rolled up his linen sleeves in the way men do when they want to appear serious, but relaxed. 

Their bottle of wine dripped condensation onto the tablecloth.

A tabby sauntered out from under a parked car. It slowly made its way through the passing foot traffic, unbothered by the threat of being stepped on. The confidence of an animal that made dogs five times its size give right of way in their own home. It hopped through the bars separating the well dressed diners from the rest of the world, with more grace than a tiger jumping through a ring of fire. In between the legs of one table of diners, and straight towards the well pressed chinos of the serious but relaxed man. It rubbed against the man’s leg, tail up, and purred. 

The same man who’d stepped over a homeless guy that morning without even glancing down actually smiled when the cat brushed his leg, as if the little creature had somehow earned itself a tip.

“Oh my god, look at it babe!” the woman said, reaching down. “He likes you.”

The man bent to scratch the cat under the chin. The cat leaned into it, purring like it was auditioning for something.

It was sweet. Harmless. Something they’d weave into the story they'd tell friends later.

They burst out laughing as it hopped onto the table, startled but still charmed. The woman moved her glass out of reach, but the cat nudged it with its head, uninterested. It sniffed the bread, the olives, skipped the salt shaker. The man reached out, half amused, half unsure what the etiquette was for removing a cat from your lunch.

In a dimly lit room, not too far away, a figure watched a glowing monitor. The cursor moved to ‘execute’, his finger hesitated for a moment before clicking. One line of code appeared on the screen. *Gastric event initiated.*

That was when the cat’s body tightened.

A tiny twitch of its ears, an eye flicked sideways as if pulled by an invisible thread.

Its tail jerked once, sharp and wrong.

“Hey, little man, you alright?” the man asked.

The cat made a noise halfway between a cough and a scream, as its whole body started to tense.

A violent torrent of faeces erupted across the table, a hot, forceful spray that hit the plates, the olives, the man’s shirt, everything, even the salt shaker got attention this time. The smell bloomed instantly in the air, alerting the diners who managed to ignore the screams.

As she shrieked, her chair fell backward. The man lurched to his feet, sloshing wine across the table and his own shirt. People at nearby tables recoiled. A waiter dropped a basket of bread. Someone shouted something that sounded like a prayer or maybe a curse in Italian. 

Her lemon sundress was ruined. So was the fantasy of a perfect afternoon

The man slapped at his mouth, horrified. “Oh my fucking god,” he yelled. “It’s in my mouth. It went in my mouth!”

Several diners gagged. A woman clamped a hand over her child’s face. A man hurried to the gutter and retched, body folding over itself.

The cat jumped down and vanished between the hedges, leaving chaos in its wake like a tiny, indifferent god.

A few metres away, on the street, a teenager in an oversized hoodie had her phone out, laughing so hard the camera shook.

“This city is cooked today,” she said to her livestream. “Guys, wait till you see this.” She swung her camera toward the couple, zooming in as they tried to clean themselves with napkins that only made things worse.

Comments shot up the screen.

*Wtf – why is this happening everywhere – I’ve seen three of these today  #poopocalypse –  nah this is cursed*

Across the street, another cat bolted from beneath a chair and left a splatter across the pavement. A man jumped back, swearing. A barista swore even louder as she rushed to shut the café door before the animal could make it inside.

The teen zoomed in, delighted. “This is so feral. I feel bad but *oh my god*.”

Her chat exploded with new viewers.

And then, back in the dimly lit room, in front of the glowing monitor.  The figure leaned closer, the light from the screen hit part of his cheek, then faded away as one video flickered and cut to the next.

The room was quiet. The figure watched the feed cycle. 

Then, without thinking about it, he smiled. The smile felt wrong for a second, or maybe it felt right — which was worse.

Her best friend from way back has always been kinda weird around me but I figured she was just protective or whatever.

The other day her friend asked to meet me for coffee saying she wanted to talk about surprise bachelorette party ideas. I thought it was cool so I went. She starts off normal then gets all serious and basically tells me that I'm ""not right"" for my fiancée and that our ""lifestyles don't match."" I'm sitting there confused as hell because we're literally planning a wedding. Then this woman slides an envelope across the table. I open it and there's a check for $15,000.

She deadass offered me fifteen grand to break up with my fiancée before the wedding. Said it would ""save everyone the trouble of a divorce later"" and that I should take it as a ""head start on my next chapter."" I was so shocked I literally just stared at her for like a full minute. She said I could even keep the ring and use the money however I want, and that my fiancée would get over it eventually.

I told her to go fuck herself, took a picture of the check, and left. When I told my fiancée she confronted her friend and apparently the friend spun some story about how I ""misunderstood"" and she was just trying to help me because she heard I was stressed about wedding costs. Now half their friend group thinks I'm making drama out of nothing or that I was trying to actually take the money. My fiancée believes me but she's torn because this has been her best friend forever. The whole thing is insulting because I already have money set aside for our future, it's not like I need some random payout to be okay.

Some hide the slow unmaking of a life. Behind 1E lives a woman drifting through the fading corridors of her own mind, her memories slipping through her grasp like water she can no longer hold. The building watches her gently, almost with pity, as the past she once cherished dissolves room by room. Behind 1E, she slips away quietly, one moment at a time. Tonight, we step into the soft unraveling of a life forgetting itself.”

-1E-

She wandered the hallway of her apartment with slow, uncertain steps as one hand trailed along the wall like she needed it to hold her up. She whispered to herself as she moved.

“I was… I was doing something… wasn’t I?”

Her voice had a trembling, papery thinness, like she was afraid of startling her own thoughts into hiding.

The faint scent of something tugged at her nose. Something unknown. Something important. She followed it into the kitchen, sniffing the air, checking the sink, the fridge, even the trash can. 
Nothing.
She opened the fridge again, checked the sink, the fridge again and the trash can. 
Nothing, still.

A knock startled her so sharply she clutched her own chest.

She opened the door to reveal a broad shouldered and gentle eyed man standing in the entrance of her apartment.

“Oh, sweetheart,” she said, soft and relieved. “You came home so fast.” 

He blinked, offering a sad smile. “It’s just me, ma’am. The super.”

Confusion flickered across her face like a shadow passing a window. Her words stuttered, afraid and apologetic. “Oh. Yes. Of course. I knew that. I just…something smells strange. I can’t find it.”

“I’ll take a look, ma’am.” he said kindly, stepping inside.

She followed him anxiously, hovering in doorways as he checked vents, pipes, and corners. Then he moved to her bedroom as the woman lingered behind him. 

“What does it smell like?” he asked, crouching by the bedroom vent.

She opened her mouth, and paused.
“It’s… I don’t know anymore,” she whispered. “It was something. Something from… somewhere.”

He stood, brushing off his hands.
“I don’t smell anything,” he said with regret in his voice but a soft smile curled on his face as he spoke to her gently. “But I’ll come back tomorrow. I’ll check everything here again and also the vents in the empty unit next door too, alright?”

She nodded gratefully.
“Thank you, sweetheart. It’s so nice to have you home.” 

He didn’t correct her this time.

When he left, the quiet swallowed the apartment. She drifted toward the back hallway, whispering the shapes of rooms under her breath as she pointed to each one in order. 

“Bathroom… hall closet… spare room… where was I…”

Then she stopped.

The tall, darkened doorway frame that led into her spare bedroom loomed in the short distance from her, but someone was standing in the frame. Not clearly. Just a silhouette. Her breath hitched. Not in fear, but in recognition.

“Is it…is that you?” she whispered, voice trembling with hope. “Baby…?” She stepped closer to the door.
“Son?”

The figure slipped into the room without sound, and she followed, drawn by something deep in her bones.

The moment she stepped through the doorway, the room changed.

The beige carpet brightened into blue carpet, the one that he had her and his dad install when he was twelve. The ribbons of accomplishments and the posters of half remembered bands appeared tacked onto the white plaster walls. A suit jacket hung on the door.

And he was there, beautiful, alive, standing in front of the mirror with nervous, fumbling hands trying to fix a tie.

“Mom,” he said, laughing lightly. “I can’t get this stupid thing right.”

She felt tears gather instantly as motherly instincts took over and she moved over to stand before the frame of her son. 
“Oh…oh, sweetheart, here. Let me.”
Her hands moved automatically, fixing the knot like she’d done a hundred times before.

He swallowed hard. “Thanks mom.”
He let out a long breathy sigh that seemed, at least to her, to hold more weight and a lingering hollow feeling hidden within it.
“This is it, mom. I’m leaving.”

“What? Leaving? Son, what are you…what do you mean?”

He touched her arm gently, smiling through something she couldn’t understand. “I have to go.”

The form of her son hugged her, released, and walked toward the doorway as his edges began to break apart. He smiled. That same smile that he had given her so many times when she had him in her life. The kind that says, “I love you,” without any words needed.
His shirt faded first, then his hands, then his face.
He gave her one more soft, heartbreaking look, and vanished.

The room dissolved around her like melting paper. She blinked. She was alone in a dim spare bedroom she barely recognized.

“What…what was I doing in here?”
Her voice was small.

She backed into the hallway when the smell of saltwater pushed past her. The sounds of gulls calling through breezy air and the subtle crash of waves started to etch their echoes around the room. She turned toward a framed photo on the wall. One of two young women laughing at the beach. She stared at the picture feeling cool wind and warm sun beams on her skin when, suddenly, a hand rested gently on her shoulder. She turned.

A woman in her mid thirties stood beside her. She was vibrant and lovely wearing a huge straw hat, a yellow sunflower patterned sundress and huge mirror framed sunglasses that reflected the image of the older woman. 
Her best friend.
The old woman stood there, looking at her, sunlit and smiling, the way she always was and always would be to her, when she was in her thirties. “It’s beautiful here, isn’t it?” the image murmured. The older woman’s breath shuddered.

“I miss you,” she whispered. “I…I have missed you. Where did you go?” Her friend nodded softly. 

“Oh no baby, I didn’t go anywhere. I was here. Just buried in so much noise that it took me this long to cut through it all and see you one last time.”
They both gave each other an embrace that felt like reuniting and never leaving all at once. That is until the words her friend just said bent back around to the forefront of her mind.
“One last time? What do you mean?” She said, hands still gripping her friend as she pushes back seeing her reflection again in the sunglasses hanging on her face. 
“Sadly, I can’t stay. And neither can you my dear. You have to go back, and I…well I just have to go.”

“What do you mean? Go where?”

“I’m sorry,” her friend whispered, the voice already fading. “I don’t want to, but I must go. And you do too.” The sunlight dimmed. The warmth dissolved. The beach unraveled.

She blinked, and the photo in her hands was empty. Empty of meaning. Just a frame with nothing inside. Nothing inside that she remembered. 

She stood inside the hallway holding a meaningless trinket that didn’t even garner a longing glance from her eyes as a new scent reached her next.
Coffee, strong, warm, familiar. A tall, trembling shadow passed through the kitchen doorway.
Her heart lurched, as she placed the frame that pictured someone she didn’t know down on the end table. 

“No,” she whispered. “No… it can’t be…” She steadied herself on the wall, shuffling toward the kitchen, guided more by fear than curiosity. She turned the corner, and the room shifted.

Her husband’s favorite mug was on the counter. The old coffeemaker sputtered softly. He stood there, aging face full of love and sadness.

“Honey,” he said warmly. “Sit down. I’ll make you a cup.”

She obliged him, she always did and she collapsed into the chair like it was the only solid thing in the world as he walked slowly over to bring her a fresh cup, setting it on the table beside her.  He knelt down next to her, taking the hand of his one and only love into his. 

“I need to tell you something.”

She swallowed, nodding.

“I loved you. Have always loved you. Every day. From the moment we met, to our wedding, to the day our son was born. Through everything. Even after the world took him from us. Took me away from you.”
Her lip trembled. “Loved? Do you not, right now? Love me?”
He glanced with a smile at her saddened expression holding a smile she remembered from a half faded memory. “Oh honey,” he said softly, “I have loved, love, and will love you always. Even when there isn’t a remnant of me that remains, my love will.” 
They both stared in each other’s eyes for a solid beat of time. Their ageless longing for each other never subsided and never wained. Yet, his next impulse was not his choice, he had no decision to make here, only the act. He stood, “But now, my love, I must leave you. Even though I wish nothing more than to stay.”
“Then don’t go,” she begged. “Please don’t go.”

His thumb brushed over her fingers, warm, familiar, heartbreaking.

“I have to,” he whispered. “And soon you won’t remember I was even here, or why this hurts to begin with.”

“No, if you leave me…I…how will I find you? How would I ever learn to live without you?”

He kissed her hand one last time.

“Baby,” he hesitated as he stood and looked at her, as if trying to take in all of her, every molecule, “I’m not even here now sweetie.”

“I’m…I don’t understand.”

His outline thinned.
His eyes faded.
His voice disappeared.
And the kitchen snapped back into the dim, modern space she lived in.
She stared at a cold coffee mug covered in a thin layer of dust that sat on the table.

“Why… why am I crying?” she whispered, touching her wet cheeks with shaking fingers. She began wiping them away, with no recollection of even why they were there in the first place. 

As she sat rubbing her palms down her cheeks she immediately froze with her hands halfway between her eyes and jawline. The smell that coalesced in the air fired off neurons in her brain bringing forth a long dormant memory. She couldn’t connect the dots in her weary mind of why it was here but she knew every particle of the scent and exactly from what place it belonged to.

It was floral, it was sweet and it was covered in love as it floated past her, filling her nostrils as if begging her to come find it. 

She slowly rose from the chair in her barren kitchen and walked out into the living room. The space did not resemble the current drab living arrangements of her own apartment but instead looked like a memory long pushed into recesses so deep that the sight of her new surroundings felt like an old lover wrapping her in a warm embrace. 

Warm firelight flickered on polished wood floors. Flowers glowing with color in pots arranged on the mantle and window sills brought a bursting of color to entire room. The memory took shape as the space that once occupied the area slowly gave way to the powerful image of where she was, had been, and held steady and exact. 
 
A cottage.
Soft. Safe.
That long forgotten place.
Home.

Standing behind a brushed brown colored couch were the vague silhouettes of far forgotten outlines of people she couldn’t quite place. Frames of vapor that seemed to hold shapes of only ages. Young, vibrant, loving. They stood without motion…watching her, waiting.

She walked over, stood tentatively before the outlines, squinting her eyes as if trying to gain an inkling of a reminder of what they are, who they are, or were, or should be. She blinked rubbed her eyes and felt her body ache and turned slowly before the feeling of fatigue grabbed her and she took a seat with a sigh on the sofa. Her hands stretched over the fabric of the cushions the material edging around her fingertips as a smile found its place. She hadn’t sat here in so long but she knew every detail. 

Then, delicate, soft footsteps interrupted the somber remembrance. 
A presence warm like sunlight entered the cozy cottage from a life she once knew. 
A beautiful young woman stepped from the shadows.
Confident.
Alive.
Gentle.

“Hey there, sweetheart,” it said softly. “I’m here.”

The old woman’s lips parted.
“I… I know you. I’m…you’re…me?”

“That’s right,” the younger self whispered, kneeling in front of her. “Hey there, lovely.”

She took the old woman’s hand in both of hers. She clasped them ever so gently before looking up to meet her own gaze. 

And then she spoke.

“Hey… look at me. I’m right here. I’m the last piece of you left, you know. Everyone else…the memories, the people, the moments you loved…they’ve already gone.
And now it’s just us. Just you and me. I wish you hadn’t had to grow old without them.
Without me.
I didn’t want you to carry everything alone. But you did. For so long. Longer than any heart should have to.
You’re scared.
I know.
But you’ve been scared for years, haven’t you? Trying so hard to hold on when your own mind kept turning against you. Your memory failing you piece by piece…like an ever present, slow moving coup,
quiet and patient, taking your life one room at a time while you stood there helpless.
Trying to remember faces that should’ve been impossible to forget. Trying to stay here…even when here stopped making sense.
I’m sorry.
I’m so, so sorry you had to do all of this by yourself. You don’t deserve this kind of ending. This slow unmaking. You deserved warmth, and company, and someone to tell you it’s alright when the lights go out. But this is where we are.
You and me, in the last quiet corner of your mind.
And…I need you to hear something.
When I go, there won’t be anything left to fear. There won’t be anything left to hurt you. There won’t be anything left at all.
But you won’t feel alone.
I promise.
There will be nothing left inside you to feel lonely with. Please don’t cry…you’re forgetting me already.
See? You’re looking right through me. I’m fading even as you try to hold on.
You weren’t supposed to watch me disappear. I was supposed to be the one who lived. Lived on through you. But it’s all going backwards now.
When I’m gone… you’ll be safe. Empty, but safe.
And I hope…
God, I hope…
some small part of you remembers that someone once loved you. Even if it was only me. Even if it was only the girl you used to be.”

The figures behind her faded first, softly, quietly, like dust settling.

Then her younger self, her last memory, the last bit of her, 
smiled through tears and whispered, “Goodbye, sweetheart. I love you.”

And she dissolved like smoke blown apart by a breeze.

The cottage room snapped back into her dim apartment. The old woman sat alone on the floor, tears streaking her face.
She looked around, confused.
Lost.
Hollow.

“Why…why am I…here?” she whispered.

Then, softer:

“Who…who am I?”

Her voice broke into a small, frightened whimper. She covered her eyes with trembling hands, rocking in the silence. And only the apartment held her, empty, quiet, waiting, as the last of her faded into the dark.

“In the end, the tenant of 1E doesn’t leave, she simply disappears, one fading thought at a time. There is no finale to a mind unraveling, only the soft collapse of everything that once held her together until even the collapse goes quiet. When the last of her slips away, the building exhales and closes the door behind her. Another life reduced to gentle, devastating nothing, and added to the ever growing ledger. Next week, we climb to Unit 5C, where forgetting is a mercy the tenant will never be granted, because his memories don’t fade. They fight back.”

1pcqi8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1pcqi8k/fuck_corporate_america/,Fuck Corporate America,"Every day I march into a gray tomb pretending everything is “exciting” and a ""great opportunity,"" when really, I just want to pay my fucking bills. How am I supposed to get excited when sitting in meetings that could have been emails? Is anyone really expected to enjoy “fast paced” when everything is due yesterday, and it's your fault if it isn't done? 

I hate my coworkers, too. Suck ups who don’t have a spinal cord to hold them upright, but they’re strong enough to throw me under the bus if need be. I don’t give a shit about you or your problems, I just want you to do your fucking job so I can do mine. Capisce? 

And then there are the execs. The asshole poster children who get paid enough to colonize Mars while laying off entire teams to “optimize efficiency.” They sound like cult leaders telling us how “people are our greatest asset” immediately after canceling remote work so they can watch us rot in a cubicle. Or better yet, they announce layoffs around Christmas! (We're all just drinking the Kool Aid, folks.)

And the perks? Don’t make me laugh. Ping-pong tables no one touches, “unlimited PTO,” which really means “good luck getting your manager to approve a three-day weekend,” and the corporate picnic full of farting coworkers’ kids, lukewarm hot dogs, and stupid games we all have to play. Fuck that! I don’t need to carve another goddamn pumpkin. I’m not your fucking monkey on my day off!  Oh, by the way, I actually took a month off after my project was complete and no one needed anything from me. It was approved by my Director, but damned if I didn't get hung on a cross for it by HR when I got back.

I can't forget to mention the lack of training, broken equipment, sorry-ass IT support or any other thing that's supposes to make us more productive and ""successful"" at our jobs. Ha, right! If I depended on any of that for my life, I'd die. 

But what's really a butt hurt is the annual performance review, where you’re praised for you impact and growth before they hand you a raise so tiny it should come with a microscope. All this and a new title that’s absolutely meaningless, yet ensures you have to bust your ass more hours a week. Wow… life-changing.

But hey, I get free coffee. That fixes everything.  
(shitty coffee)

1pcqhwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1pcqhwy/money_bowl_candle_caught_on_fire_but_burned/,"Money bowl candle caught on fire, but burned nothing else (+ learn from my mistake!)","Hi! So I made a money bowl yesterday. I burned half of the candle yesterday and snuffed it before bed and burned the other half today.

I didn’t cut the wick before burning so the candle burned pretty fast. Listen to me right now. CUT YOUR CANDLE WICKS. Seriously. 

The good news is, other than some of the oats/rice/herbs near the glass votive being toasted, nothing in the bowl aside from the candle burned. All the cinnamon sticks, bills, herbs, etc. are totally fine minus the toasty bits (my house smells like spiced oatmeal cookies which is a small win.) This is likely for two reasons: one, I wasn’t leaving my candle unattended and was able to quickly snuff the flame by covering it with a coffee mug once I saw it catch fire, and two, I use candles contained in glass for money bowls and never use taper or chime candles that are naked and un-contained. 

After snuffing the candle and letting it cool a bit, I cut the wick and re-lit it. It’s burning fine now. 

I’m interpreting this as something I’m skipping or not attending to is affecting my finances and that the situation isn’t beyond saving if I act now and straighten myself out. Needless to say, I’ll be printing my bank statements and making a budget spreadsheet this week. But I’m open to y’all’s interpretations as well! ",3,1764724333.0,witchcraft,1,0.8,False
