1o9ki8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TeenXZ/comments/1o9ki8i/teen_x_season_1_episode_1_my_names_maria_martínez/,"Teen X- season 1 Episode 1 : ""My name's Maria Martínez","My name’s Maria Martínez... I’m 22 years old and most days you’ll find me behind the counter at the gas station. Nothing fancy tho...just doing my job, same as always. I clock in check the pumps, stock the shelves and keep the coffee fresh. People come and go. some in a rush some just killing time. I’ve got my regulars and I know who’s going to ask for a receipt before they even say a word.

It’s not exciting, but.. I like knowing what to expect. I keep my head down, do what needs doing, and make sure the place runs smooth. No drama, no surprises. Just another day, same as the last.

a guy in suit and tie with curly hair walks in and says ""excuse me ma'am you're gas machines is not working""

I looked up from the counter blinking once to make sure I heard him right. He’s standing there with his receipt in one hand and a confused look on his face.

“Which one?” I ask already reaching for the clipboard under the register. It’s always something...pump 3 acting up again or maybe the card reader on 7 froze. He gestures toward the far end of the lot.

“Pump 5” he says. “I tried to start it, but nothing happened.”

I nod grabbing the keys, and step out into the sun. Just another hiccup in the day. I’ve dealt with worse. I press the reset button, check the screen, and give it a quick tap like I’ve done a hundred times before.

“Try it now,” I say and he gives me a thumbs-up.

Back inside, I jot it down in the log. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just doing my job.
I watched him walk back to his car but something about the way he moved didn’t sit right with me. He wasn’t rude or anything polite even but there was this weird stillness in his eyes like he was watching everything and nothing at the same time. His smile didn’t reach his face, and when he said “ma’am” it felt rehearsed, like he was playing a part.

I’ve seen all kinds come through here late-night wanderers road weary travelers, folks just trying to get home. But this guy? He stayed. Not long enough to make a scene, just long enough to make me notice. I couldn’t put my finger on it  but I kept looking at the security camera monitor after he left just to be sure.
Maybe it was nothing. Maybe I’m just tired. But I’ve learned to trust that little twist in my gut. It doesn’t speak up often but when it does I listen.

I get home around 10 most nights. The apartment’s quiet just me and the hum of the fridge. It’s a one-bedroom, nothing special but it’s mine. I like the way the light hits the wall in the morning land how I can hear the rain tapping on the window when it storms.

There’s not much food in the kitchen right now. A couple of instant noodles, maybe a can of beans. I keep telling myself I’ll go grocery shopping after work, but by the time I get off I’m too tired or too broke or both. I’ll make it work though. I always do.

It’s not perfect but it’s my space. No parents no roommates no one telling me how to live. Just me, figuring it out one day at a time.

There’s this one neighbor in the unit next to mine always up late always making noise. I don’t know their name, and I’ve never seen any kids around, not that I’d expect to. It’s just them, I think. Music, stomping, sometimes what sounds like furniture being dragged across the floor at two in the morning. I’ve tried earplugs, white noise, even sleeping on the couch once. Nothing helps.

I lie there staring at the ceiling, counting the seconds between thumps wondering what they’re doing. It’s not loud enough to call the landlord, but just enough to keep me from drifting off. I’ve thought about knocking on their door, but I don’t want to start anything. So I wait it out, hoping they’ll settle down. They usually do eventually.

Still I wake up groggy dragging myself to work with half a night’s sleep and a headache that feels like it’s been waiting for me.

Some  days, it’s just me. I don’t mind the quiet I’ve gotten used to it. I go to work, come home, heat something up if there’s anything left in the cupboard, and let the hours pass. I’m not big on crowds or small talk. I like things simple, predictable.

I do have one friend I see every now and then. We don’t talk every day, but when we do it’s easy. No pressure, no pretending. Sometimes we grab coffee, sometimes we just sit in the car and talk about nothing. It’s nice, having someone who doesn’t expect much but still shows up.

Still, I spend most of my time alone. Not lonely, exactly—just... quiet. I guess that’s how I like it.

On my off days, when I don’t have to deal with gas pumps or awkward customers I like to sink into the couch and put on a classic horror film. The kind that’s grainy and weird and doesn’t care if the ending makes sense. Nightmare on Elm Street  Dead of Night. Re-Animator those are my go-tos..

I’ll make a cup of instant coffee, pull the blanket over my legs, and let the  screen take over.  Sometimes I text my friend about the weirdest scenes..also i think my boss is a Weirdo and his Freakish  mustache.. Speaking of Which he's parking and getting out his Car right now.

""Hey maria I need you on bathroom duty"" he says 

I stare at him for a second, trying not to let my face show what I’m thinking. Bathroom duty. Of course. The same bathroom that’s been ignored for half a year, the one customers complain about but nobody ever touches. And now, suddenly, it’s my problem?

“Sure” I say, flat. No emotion. Just enough to keep things civil.

But inside, I’m boiling. He waits until the end of the shift, when I’m tired and just trying to get through the day, and then drops this on me like it’s nothing. Like it’s normal. Like I’m supposed to smile and grab the mop.

I grab the keys and head toward the back, already dreading what I’ll find. The smell hits before I even open the door. I pause, take a breath, and remind myself: just get through it. One more task. One more day.

But yeah he’s sick in the head if he thinks this is okay.

I stepped into that bathroom and froze. I kid you not—there was feces on the floor. Not just a mess, not just a spill—this was deliberate. It was smeared on the walls like someone had thrown it, like they wanted to leave a message in the worst way possible. The stench hit me like a punch to the gut. I gagged, covered my mouth, and backed out for a second just to breathe.

“What the heck is this?” I whispered to myself, trying not to lose it. I could almost puke. I’ve seen some nasty things working here, but this? This was next-level. I stood there, staring at the mess, thinking about quitting right then and there. Just walking out, leaving the keys on the counter, and never looking back.

But I didn’t. I kept my cool. Took a breath. Grabbed gloves and cleaner. Not because I wanted to—because I had to. Because no one else was going to do it, and I wasn’t about to let this place fall apart on my watch. I cleaned it up, one wipe at a time, trying not to think too hard about what kind of person does something like that.

I logged it. I made a note. And I moved on. But yeah—some days, this job tests you in ways you don’t expect.

I clocked out, wiped my hands on my jeans, and didn’t even look back at the station. I was done. The bathroom incident had drained whatever patience I had left. I called an Uber, hoping for silence, maybe a smooth ride home where I could just stare out the window and pretend the day hadn’t happened.

But of course, I’d left my headphones at home. Rookie mistake.

The driver looked like he was pushing fifty, salt-and-pepper hair, wedding ring glinting on the steering wheel. And the moment I shut the door, he started talking. Not small talk-- NO! this was full-blown venting. His wife didn’t understand him, his kids were distant, and apparently his dog preferred her over him. I nodded politely, gave the occasional “oh wow,” but inside I was screaming. I could honestly wish my head exploded right there in the back seat, just to escape the monologue.

I stared out the window, counting streetlights, trying to tune him out with nothing but my own thoughts. By the time we pulled up to my apartment, I felt like I’d aged a year. I tipped him out of guilt, not generosity, and trudged upstairs to my quiet, one-bedroom sanctuary. No talking. No drama. Just me, and the silence I’d been craving all day.

I peel off my work clothes, one layer at a time, like shedding the day. The bathroom light hums overhead, and the tile’s cool under my feet. I step into the shower and let the warm water run over me, slow and steady. It feels good—like I’m washing off more than just dirt. I grab the soap, scrub hard, trying to erase the memory of that bathroom at the station.

But the smell sticks. It’s in my nose, in my thoughts, like it followed me home. I scrub again, harder this time, until my skin feels raw. I close my eyes and let the steam rise around me, hoping it’ll carry the day away with it.

Eventually, I turn off the water, wrap myself in a towel, and stand there for a moment. Clean, but still unsettled. Some things stick longer than they should.

After the shower, I stand at the sink and take my time—fifteen full minutes just on my face. I scrub gently but thoroughly, making sure every trace of the day is gone. I check the mirror, tilt my head, rinse again. It’s not just about hygiene—it’s about control, about feeling like I’ve reclaimed something after everything that happened.

I fix my hair next, brushing it until it sits just right. The rhythm of it calms me. Then I brush my teeth, slow and steady, letting the mint settle in. I’m obsessed with being clean, and honestly? I think that’s a good thing. It’s my reset button. My way of saying, “I’m still here. I’m still me.”

The smell from the store still sticks faintly in my memory, but it doesn’t cling to my skin anymore. I’m clean. I’m calm. I’m back in my space, and that’s enough for tonight.

I think I’m gonna watch Breaking Bad tonight. There’s not much on TV lately and I’ve been a fan of the show for years. I’m just starting Season 5, Episode 1—the beginning of the end. It’s wild how far Walt’s come, how twisted things have gotten. The writing, the tension, the way every scene feels like it’s holding its breath it’s exactly the kind of show I need after a long day.

I’ll throw on my night clothes, maybe grab something to drink, and let myself sink into it. Just me, the glow of the screen, and a story that never gets old.

Recently, I’ve been hearing more and more about kidnappings happening at night in this city. It’s unsettling. People go missing, and the police never seem to find the suspect—or the victim. It’s like they vanished without a trace, like they never existed in the first place.

One day, I heard that more than twenty people went missing. Twenty. In a single night. That number stuck with me. I don’t know if it’s true, but even the rumor is enough to make me double-check my locks and glance over my shoulder when I walk home after dark.

I keep my routines tight, stay alert, and trust my instincts. I’ve lived here long enough to know when something feels off—and lately, it feels off a lot more often...

There it goes again—the noise from the neighbors. I don’t even bother checking anymore. It’s late, and whatever they’re doing, it’s not my problem. I’ve had enough for one day. Between the mess at work, the Uber ride, and everything...

I’ll call this a night. The day’s been long, strange, and loud in all the wrong ways. But I made it through. I cleaned up the worst of it, kept my cool, and now I’m here clean, quiet, and ready to let it all go.

I’ll  pull the blanket up, and let sleep take over. Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll handle it. Just like I always do.

Goodnight.

Tuesday | 10:00 am.

Welp, it’s morning. I drag myself out of bed, the light creeping in through the blinds like it’s daring me to face the day. Another shift at the station. Another round of weird customers, unpredictable messes, and that same stale air.

I think about calling in sick. Just one day to myself—to breathe, to reset, to not be responsible for anyone else’s chaos. It’s tempting. I could spend the day doing whatever: writing, watching something decent maybe even just sitting in silence.

But first, I shower. The water’s warm. I scrub slowly, letting the steam wake me up. No matter what I decide, this part’s mine.

After I finish bathing, I pat my skin dry and reach for the ointment. I smooth it over the spots that need it—routine, careful, like I’ve done a hundred times before. It’s part of the process now, part of keeping myself steady.

Then I brush my hair, slow and methodical, watching it fall into place in the mirror. I brush my teeth next letting the mint settle in and clear away the last traces of sleep. The whole routine feels like armor clean skin clean hair clean breath. I move through each step like clockwork, and by the end of it  I feel ready. Not excited, not energized just ready. That’s enough.

I began by putting on my work clothes, each piece a signal that the day was officially starting. The air felt heavy, like the city hadn’t quite woken up yet. Before heading out, I grabbed my headphones thankfully I didn’t forget them this time and hit play on Tears Don’t Fall by Bullet for My Valentine.

I called an Uber to get to work. It took 40 minutes longer than usual and I felt every second of it. As I waited, I kept hoping this driver wouldn’t start unloading their personal drama the moment I got in. I just wanted quiet. A ride where I could zone out, maybe let the music carry me through the morning without someone narrating their life story.

When the car pulled up, I hesitated for a second before getting in. Just me, the seat and the hope that today’s ride would be uneventful. I’ve got enough on my plate without playing therapist before my shift even starts.

“So where we headed to?” the Uber driver asks, glancing at me through the rearview mirror.

I tell him the name of my job, short and to the point. No extra details. Then I put my headphones back in and let the music take over. I’m not in the mood for small talk, especially not someone else’s life story before I’ve even clocked in.

The car drives along the road, and I stare out the window, watching the city pass by in fragments. Just me, the music, and the ride. That’s all I need right now.

I finally arrived at work it felt like forever in that car. The ride dragged and by the time I stepped out, my legs were stiff and my patience thin. I unlocked the doors. and started putting everything where it needed to be.

Trash bins, supplies, register each piece fell into place like muscle memory. I didn’t waste time. I just got stuff done. The station was quiet for now, but I knew it wouldn’t last. I braced myself for whatever the day decided to throw at me.

I started by sweeping the floor the Dust, crumbs, bits of whatever gone with each pass. Then I filled the mop bucket, the water cloudy and warm, and started working the floor in slow strokes.

After that, I moved to the windows. The glass was streaked from the night, fingerprints and smudges catching the morning light. I sprayed and wiped until they were clear again, watching the outside world sharpen into focus. It’s quiet work, but it gets me grounded. One task at a time..

It’s 9:59 p.m. just a few more seconds and I’m out of here. I grab the last box of chips, slide them into place on the shelf, lining them up neat like I always do. The store’s quiet now, fluorescent lights humming overhead, and the air feels still, like it’s waiting for me to clock out.

I take one last look around. Everything’s where it should be. Clean floors, stocked shelves, register shut down. I did my part. Time to go.

Suddenly a rock crashes against the window sharp loud like a gunshot in the quiet. I hear laughter high-pitched and fading fast as a car speeds off down the road. I run outside, heart pounding, and see the glass shattered jagged edges catching the light.

“What the—”

I just stand there for a second, staring at the mess. Then I sigh deep and tired, and go back in. No point chasing ghosts. I’ll have to report it, maybe sweep up the shards, maybe not. It’s late. I just want to go home.

I cleaned up the broken glass, sweeping carefully around the edges and making sure no shards were left behind. The air still felt tense, like the laughter from those kids hadn’t quite faded. After everything was cleared, I picked up the phone and called my boss.

I kept it simple just the facts. Told him what happened, how I handled it, and that the window’s going to need replacing. He didn’t say much, just the usual sigh and a promise to “look into it.” I hung up, locked the door, and stood there for a moment, letting the quiet settle back in. Another night, another mess.

After that My phone died and just like that, I was stuck walking to the train station at night. The streets felt emptier than usual too quiet, too still. Every shadow stretched longer, every sound sharper. I kept my pace steady, eyes scanning the sidewalks, alleys, parked cars. I knew what kind of stories floated around here. Kidnappings disappearances. People who didn’t make it home.

I stayed close to the streetlights, avoided shortcuts, and kept my hands free. No music, no distractions. my footsteps, moving fast but not panicked. I trusted my instincts. I’ve made it through worse. I just needed to get to the station, get on that train, and get home.

As I’m walking, I catch something in the shadow of an alley—low to the ground, unmoving, but its eyes glow red. Not like a reflection. Like they’re watching me. I freeze, heart thudding, and take a slow step back  The air feels colder suddenly, like the night’s holding its breath.

Then headlights cut through the dark. An old woman pulls up in a faded sedan window rolled down just enough.

“You need a ride, young lady?” she asks, voice calm, almost too calm.

I don’t hesitate. I nod, open the door, and slide in. Whatever that thing was, I’m not sticking around to find out. The car smells like lavender and old upholstery. I don’t ask questions. I just watch the alley fade in the rearview mirror.

“A young lady like you shouldn’t be walking around so late,” she says, her with concern. “What were you doing?”

“Uh… I was walking to the bus station,” I reply, trying to sound casual, like it’s no big deal.

She glances at me, then back at the road. “It’s not safe out here anymore. Not like it used to be.”

I nod, not really wanting to get into it. I just want to get home.

“They say they’re doing everything they can to find those victims, huh?” the old lady says her eyes on the road ahead. “I don’t believe that one bit.”

I stay quiet. There’s something heavy in her voice like she’s seen too much, heard too many promises that went nowhere. The car goes along, streetlights flickering past the windows. I glance out half expecting to see those red eyes again.

She doesn’t say anything else for a while, and I don’t press. Some truths don’t need answers. They just sit there, quiet and sharp.

I asked her if she had any kids, just trying to kill the silence, maybe shift the mood.

She nodded slowly. “Three,” she said. “Had three. Two of them… they died. Night forest attack. Long time ago.”

Her voice didn’t crack, but something in her eyes did. I didn’t know what to say. Just sat there letting the weight of her words settle between us. I felt bad for her really bad. That kind of loss doesn’t fade. It just folds into who you are.

The car kept moving, but the air inside felt still. I didn’t ask anything else. Some stories don’t need follow-ups.

I tell her to stop my destination’s just up ahead, my house only a minute away. She pulls over gently, the car slowing to a quiet halt under the streetlight. I reach for the door handle, and before I step out, she looks at me with a kind, tired smile.

“Stay safe, honey,” she says.

I nod “thank you,”

I began walking up the stairs, each step heavier than the last. When I reached my floor something felt off. My door—usually locked tight was cracked open. Just enough to make my stomach drop.

I stepped inside slowly. The apartment was a mess. Things out of place Heck even. Drawers open. My routine, my order disturbed...crap

I didn’t hesitate. I went straight! to the vent near the floor grabbed the screwdriver from the drawer and unscrewed it with steady hands. Inside, untouched were my dual pistols. I pulled them out checked the chambers, and stood up.

Whatever this was, I wasn’t going to be caught off guard.



I walk slowly through the apartment, dual pistols raised, every breath tight in my chest. The silence is thick—too thick. Then, out of nowhere, it lunges from the hallway shadows, slamming me to the ground with a weight that knocks the air out of me.

Its eyes burn red, teeth bared, jaws opening wide. I don’t wait. I jam both barrels into its ribcage and pull the triggers twice, each side. The shots echo like thunder in the small space, and the thing screeches, stumbling back, smoke rising from the wounds.

But it doesn’t stay down. The flesh knits itself back together slow. It’s healing.

I scramble to my feet, heart pounding, sweat cold on my back. This thing isn’t just breaking in it’s hunting.

It hurls the TV at me no warning, just raw force. I dive to the side, barely missing the impact as the screen shatters against the floor, glass and plastic exploding across the room. The sound is deafening a crunch and crack off the walls.

I hit the ground hard, but I’m still holding the pistols. My ears ring, my pulse spikes, and I scramble behind the couch for cover.


It hurls the couch like it weighs nothing, crashing into the wall behind me. Before I can react, it’s on me—claws digging in, its grip tightening around my neck. My vision blurs, breath caught in my throat.

But I don’t panic.

I raise one pistol, press it against the side of its neck, and fire. The shot rips through flesh, and it lets out a guttural snarl, stumbling back just enough for me to breathe again. Smoke curls from the wound, but I can already see it starting to close.

It’s buying me seconds. That’s all I need.

I crawl toward the katana, fingers brushing the hilt just as I hear it charging. The floorboards creak under its weight, and I don’t think I just move. I spin, blade slicing through the air, and catch it clean across the neck.

Its head hits the ground with a wet thud, and dark green goo sprays everywhere—my face, my hair, my clothes. I sit down hard, breath ragged, staring up at the ceiling like it might offer answers.

So… yeah. I kill vampires.

I’m a vampire hunter.

I glance around glass shards, busted furniture green goo smeared across the walls and floor. My TV’s a wreck, the couch’s halfway across the room, and the smell of gunpowder still sticks My perfect hair’s sticky, my face’s got streaks of vampire sludge, and the pistols are still warm in my hands.

“Aw man,” I mutter dragging a hand down my cheek. “Look at this place. It’s all messy.”

I sit there, legs stretched out, katana resting beside me and just breathe. Cleanup can wait. Right now, I’m alive. And that’s enough.

I get up, still catching my breath, and look over at the wreckage. The TV’s a mess—screen spiderwebbed with cracks, plastic frame bent, wires poking out like guts.

“Awe man,” I say rubbing my face. “That cost me five hundred dollars.”

I crouch down, poking at the shards like they might magically fix themselves. “Dang it… it’s freaking shattered.”

The room smells like gunpowder and vampire goo. My hair’s ruined, my couch’s halfway to the kitchen, and now I’ve got no TV. Great. Just great. I sit back down, katana across my lap, and stare at the ceiling again. Welcome to the life.

The vampire’s body begins to crumble, the edges of its form breaking apart like dry ash caught in a breeze. No flames, no screams just silence as it disintegrates into dust, swirling briefly in the air before settling across the floor in a thin, dark layer.

I stand there, goo still clinging to my clothes, watching the last flecks vanish. The room’s quiet again. Too quiet. Like the fight never happened except for the mess, the broken furniture, and the smell of scorched decay.

I wipe my face, exhale slowly, and say to myself, “Guess I’ll add that to the log.”


Mrs. Baker stands outside in her slippers, arms crossed, white hair catching the porch light like a halo. Her voice cuts through the quiet

“Girl, what foolishness are you doing up here now? My son Elijah is sleeping and you’re keeping him up he’s got work in the morning, girl!”

I wipe some of the goo off my cheek, still catching my breath, and nod.

“Sorry, Mrs. Baker. It won’t happen again.”

She squints at me, probably noticing the mess behind me, the broken window, the faint smell of gunpowder. But she doesn’t ask. Just shakes her head and mutters something about “young folks and their chaos” before heading back inside.

That’s Mrs. Baker. Always watching. Always saying what needs to be said.

I think imma just head to bed. Yep… that’s actually what I’m going to do.  

I’ve got vampire goo in my hair, my TV’s a pile of shattered dreams, and Mrs. Baker probably freaking thinks I’m summoning demons up here..or sum 

I holster the pistols, wipe down the katana, and step over the mess like it’s just another Tuesday. I flick off the hallway light lay into bed, and let the silence wrap around me.  

Tomorrow’s problems can wait. Tonight, I sleep.

Wednesday | 9:00 am

I woke up early today and oh my God... I look ten times worse!! than I did last night. My hair’s a disaster, my face looks like it lost a fight with a blender and don’t even get me started on the goo crusted on my shirt. I might cry. Like seriously, Jesus take the wheel, I look like crap.

So help me God, if I don’t fix myself, I’m going to jump off a bridge ughhhhhhh. Not really obviously. I’m not about that life. But still. I look like a unicorn alien took a crap on me and then high-fived my soul on the way out.

I need a shower, a comb, maybe a small miracle.


There’s a knock at the door. I freeze mid-step, still in my oversized hoodie, hair looking like it lost a fight with a tornado. I don’t remember calling anyone over. I peek through the peephole—Ellie. Of course my best friend.

I open the door, and she steps in, backpack slung over one shoulder, eyes immediately scanning the wreckage.

“Uh hey Maria—wowhoho what happened here?! Huhh.”

I laugh it off, trying to sound casual. “It was a party. With a boy. Yep. Multiple boys actually. Mhm. Wild night.”

She squints at me like I just told her I joined a circus. “Maria, I’ve known you since middle school. You’re a freaking introvert. No boys would be over here. If anything, you avoid men and sit alone with emo music.”

I raise a finger. “First of all I’m not emo. Second… okay yeah, fair.”

She squints at me, nose wrinkling. “And what is that weird green stuff on you—wait don’t tell me. I don’t wanna hear about your weird emo fantasies or anything like that. But anyways I wanted to ask you Do you want to get some food with me?”

I blink still crusty from battle, hair in full chaos mode. “Sure, I guess I have time. Just let me finish up myself okay?”

She nods, already halfway out the door. “Okay Maria. I’ll be waiting downstairs.”

I close the door behind her glance at the mirror and sigh. Emo fantasies i say. I’m not emo. I just kill vampires and occasionally look like a rejected extra from a sci-fi horror flick. Big difference..

After scrubbing off the vampire goo and reclaiming some semblance of humanity, I get dressed. Black sweater, sleeves a little too long on my arms like armor. Tattoo choker snug around my neck.

a pleated black skirt swishes just right when I move, paired with black and white striped thigh-high socks And then the boots Lamado Overkills. Chunky, unapologetic loud. They thud against the floor like a warning.

I glance in the mirror. Still tired.

I'm definitely not the energetic type. I don’t bounce into rooms or light up conversations. I’m soft-spoken, always have been. Even with friends, my voice stays low. I say what I mean, but I don’t say much. Ellie talks enough for both of us anyway.




I walk out the door, boots thudding against the hallway floor with every step. The morning light hits just right, catching the edge of my choker and the stripes on my socks. I feel halfway human again.

Ellie leaning against the stairwell railing, scrolling through her phone. She looks up and grins.

“Looking good girl.”

I smirk brushing a hand through my hair. 

She laughs, already turning toward the exit. “Come on”


“So how’s that university thing going on?” I ask her, keeping my voice low like always.

She lights up instantly. “It’s going good, actually. It’s great—making friends and stuff” she says, swinging her bag a little as we walk.

Normally I don’t like small talk. It feels forced like chewing on cardboard. But Ellie's different. With her, it’s easy. I don’t have to pretend to be louder than I am or explain why I’d rather sit in silence.. She gets it. She always has.

I nod letting her talk and the morning feels a little less heavy.

“Well I’m happy you’re doing well for yourself,” I say my voice soft like always.

Ellie smiles, nudging me with her elbow. “Thanks, Maria. You know I’m just trying to survive midterms and not cry in public.”

I chuckle, boots thudding against the pavement as we walk. The morning’s still cool the sky pale. It’s nice this quiet. I don’t talk much.. but with her I don’t have to.

When I’m not working my day job at the gas station dealing with broken pumps, weird customers, and the occasional spilled slushie or hanging out with Ellie's or just enjoying some quiet alone time in my apartment, I spend my nights hunting vampires.

It’s not a hobby. It’s a necessity. They’re real they’re dangerous, and they don’t care if you’re tired from a double shift or just want to eat ramen in peace.

Ellie doesn’t know. She thinks I’m just introverted a little weird, maybe too into horror movies. She doesn’t know vampires exist let alone that I’ve taken down more than a few. I keep it that way. She’s got her university life her friends her midterms. She doesn’t need this kind of chaos.

So I keep it quiet.. I clean my gear track patterns, and when the sun goes down, I go to work. Alone. Always alone..

“Ah, here after you, bestie,” Ellie says, pushing open the door to the coffee place with a smile.

I step in behind her, boots thudding  against the polished floor. The place smells like cinnamon and espresso, warm and unfamiliar. I glance around mismatched chairs, a chalkboard menu with drinks I’ve never heard of.

I’ve never seen this place before. Then again I rarely leave the house unless it’s work groceries or vampire-related. Samantha’s the explorer. I’m the quiet shadow that follows when invited.

She’s already waving at the barista like she’s been here a hundred times. I tuck my hands into my sleeves and scan the menu trying not to look too out of place.


She ordered for me, like she always does. Not because I can’t order for myself—I can—but because she knows I hate the whole process. The staring at the menu, the awkward “uh, I’ll have…” moment, the pressure to sound decisive when I’d rather just whisper my order and disappear.

Ellie gets that. She’s kind like that. She doesn’t make a thing out of it, doesn’t tease me or act like she’s doing me a favor. She just does it, like it’s the most normal thing in the world.

I sit down at a corner table, letting the warm coffee shop settle around me. It’s nice. Quiet. And with her around I don’t have to explain myself.

She started talking about university her classes her new friends some professor who apparently looks like a tired raccoon. I just sat there, sipping my drink. She was so happy to tell me everything, her eyes lighting up with every story.

I didn’t say much. I rarely do. But I smiled, nodded, let her talk. It’s nice, seeing her like this. Like the world’s finally opening up for her. And even if I don’t always know what to say, I’m glad she wants to share it with me.


She’s a bit younger than me—like 21—but it doesn’t really feel like it. Ellie's got this energy, this way of talking like the world’s still unfolding in front of her, and she’s ready to dive in. I admire that, even if I don’t say it out loud.

Me? I’ve seen a few more things. Worked longer hours. Fought things she doesn’t even know exist. But when we’re sitting across from each other in a coffee shop, her rambling about campus life and me quietly sipping my drink, it doesn’t matter. She’s my friend. My exception. And I like hearing her talk.

I gave myself the nickname Void. Or sometimes, VoidHunter depends on the night. It started as a joke in my logbook, but it stuck. It fits.

Ellie doesn’t know. She thinks I’m just Maria soft-spoken, introverted, the girl who wears striped socks and listens to weird music. She doesn’t know what I do when the sun goes down. Doesn’t know about the green blood, the broken katana the way I catalog every encounter like it’s a science.

A while back I built a jet pack.

It started as a late-night idea one of those “what if” moments that spiraled into soldering wires on my kitchen floor and scavenging parts from old appliances. I had no blueprint, just instinct and stubbornness. It looked like a mess of metal and ambition, but somehow, it worked. Kind of.

Let’s just say the first test flight didn’t go as planned. I got about ten feet off the ground before the thing sputtered, spun, and nearly slammed me into a dumpster behind the gas station. I limped home with bruises, a cracked phone, and a new rule: no airborne experiments without a helmet.

I was still 18. Barely. And very lucky. But I learned something that night about gravity combustion, and the fine line between genius and disaster.

Mrs. Baker was furious.

I’d barely limped back from the jet pack incident, half-covered in soot and adrenaline, when she stormed out of her apartment in her nightgown and slippers, arms crossed like a judge about to deliver a sentence.

“This girl and her foolishness” she said eyeing the cracked pavement and the suspiciously spiderwebbed windshield of Mr. Patel’s sedan.

I didn’t argue. Just nodded, apologized, and promised to keep the noise down next time. She huffed, turned on her heel and disappeared back inside, probably to call someone about “the menace upstairs.”

I added a note to my logbook: Jet pack test fail. Mrs. Baker unimpressed. Possible property damage. Avoid future launches near residential zones.


Ellie tilts her head, sipping her iced coffee. “So what do you do Maria?”

I answer fast almost out of reflex. “Gas station worker.”

She nods, like that makes sense. Like it fits. And it does on the surface. I handle pumps, clean messes, deal with customers who think I control the weather and fuel prices. It’s simple, predictable.

She doesn’t ask more. Doesn’t press. She thinks that’s all there is.

She doesn’t know about the logbook hidden under my bed. The gear stashed in my closet. The nights I come home with cuts I can’t explain and stories I’ll never tell.

Gas station worker by day. VoidHunter by night.


The suspect’s name is actually Marcos Gonzales, not Carl Gonzales. He was arrested in Vacaville for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl at gunpoint.  

Ellie words  in my head, but something doesn’t sit right. I check the name Carl Gonzales and it turns out she’s slightly off. The man arrested for the kidnapping wasn’t Carl, but Marcos Gonzales, a 38-year-old Tacaville resident. According to police reports, the incident happened early on July 6th near Tacaville High School. The victim managed to call 911 after the assault, and officers responded quickly.

Marcos was arrested within hours, found with a registered firearm, and charged with multiple felonies including kidnapping robbery, and use of a firearm in a felony. Investigators believe it was an isolated incident, and there’s no evidence he knew the victim...

There is a Carl Gonzales 56 years old—who was arrested in Los Angeles County back in 2023 for battery with serious bodily injury but that case is unrelated.

I nod at Ellie keeping my expression neutral. She’s animated, recounting the story like it’s just another headline. But I’m already thinking deeper. Marcos Gonzales. Tacaville. Gunpoint. That kind of violence doesn’t just happen in a vacuum. I’ll be checking my logbook tonight. Cross-referencing. Just in case this isn’t as isolated as they say...

“What are you thinking about?” Ellie asks

“Oh uh… nothing,” I say quickly, eyes still on the window.

She doesn’t press. Just sips her drink and starts talking about her psych professor again, the one who wears mismatched socks and forgets his own slides. I nod, half-listening, half-sorting through the name Carl Gonzales in my head like a file I haven’t opened in years.

Nothing, I said. But my mind’s already back in the logbook, flipping through old entries, wondering if tonight’s quiet is just the calm before something worse.

“Have you ever wanted to be a superhero and save people Maria?” Ellie asks. “Like Superman?”

“Not really” I say keeping my voice even. “That’s what police are for.”

She laughs a little surprised. “Wow, okay. I thought you’d say yes. You’ve got that whole mysterious vigilante vibe.”

I shrug. “I just work at a gas station.”

She leans back, still smiling. “Sure. But if you were a superhero, you’d be the kind that doesn’t wear a cape. Just shows up, handles things, and vanishes.”

I glance at the window, watching the reflection of the streetlight flicker across the glass. I don’t answer. I don’t need to. Some things are better left unsaid.

1o9ki73,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1o9ki73/its_working_i_took_your_guys_advice_and_didnt/,It’s working! I took your guys’ advice and didn’t listen the NP who told me to only eat 1/3 of an apple.,"I don’t know if anyone remembers but I posted a few weeks ago asking what people thought about the nurse telling me in order to keep losing weight I needed to only eat 5g of sugar a meal, which meant cutting my apple (or whatever fruit it may be) into 3rds because it’s 12g of sugar. I thought that was wild, considering at that time I had already lost about 12 pounds and told her what I’d been doing. Well, I decided to ignore her advice and also not take the meds she had prescribed (phentermine), and I just stepped on the scale and I’m 307! I started at 335 (5’7” female)! I’m over the moon and I truly don’t feel deprived of anything. 

I pretty much always stay in a calorie deficit, at 1500 calories a day. Every once in a while I go over or under by 100 or so, but I’m pretty consistent. I use chat gpt to log everything I eat, if I make a meal I will tell chat gpt exactly how much of each ingredient I used and include pics of the labels, and take a before and after photo of the full meal so it estimates what I ate. It truly helps me stay accountable and pretty accurate. I still have things I enjoy so I don’t feel deprived. I mean, I don’t go crazy but the other day I really wanted steak so we went out and I had steak, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and mushrooms. I only had half and then had the rest the next day. I made other changes too like only having sugar free coffee if I’m going to get it, or sugar free sodas if I am craving one. I always check out the nutrition labels before purchasing an items. Salsa on salads instead of dressing. Chicken sausage instead of pork. Turkey chilli instead of beef. I still love my Greek yogurts so I have those! Lots of fruit if I’m craving it. I have 100 cal yasso bars in the freezer. 100 calorie skinny pop. I make it a game for myself when I’m doing my clinical rotations to find the absolute healthiest option in the cafeteria for lunch (usually steamed veggies and an absolute desiccated brick of a chicken breast). I eat it regardless because I know it’s not going to wreck my calories. I made a bunch of macarons for the techs at my clinic site and even though I had a couple, I didn’t fall off the rails. And this is on top of having tons of stress going on, being in a difficult school program, having construction on our house, being sick…

This truly feels like a new lifestyle and I’m so excited to keep going! I know not everyone will agree with how I’m doing things and I know a lot of people avoid the sugar free stuff and just cut it all together but I know myself, and I want to make this change sustainable for the long run. Even though I feel like I still appear the same size, the other day I was in a rush to put on my scrubs (accidentally bought TWO sizes too small from Figs, which already runs small). They used to fit tight as hell, with my gut nearly busting out of them. I was rushing so much that I didn’t realize they just slid right up with little resistance! 

Anyways, that was my ramble. I’m just really happy :) This has been a struggle my entire life. ",2,1760755404.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.75,False

1o9kgwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheraSeven/comments/1o9kgwx/signs_you_are_not_ready_for_this_lifestyle/,Signs you are NOT ready for this life-style,"If you’re new or between the age 18-24, please read this before you post or engage. 

Many of the mistakes young or new women here, make come from rushing in without  fully understanding the mindset this lifestyle requires. 

**1. You are too emotionally attached**

When it comes to Shera Seven lifestyle, emotional maturity is the most important thing needed to be successful. If you can’t control your emotions or detach when something doesn’t go your way, this will be difficult for you.  Getting upset because he didn’t text back, didn’t watch your story, pondering over “mixed signs/signals” or why he didn’t prioritize you the way you imagined are signs you are still emotionally reactive. The soft life requires grace, patience, and composure. You cannot just let your emotions run the show.

**2. You are too fixated on looks & feelings**

If you are fixated on a man’s appearance and physical attraction more than how he adds value to your life, you’re focused on the wrong things. As Shera would say, you need to focus on how you’re going to be getting this money. Physical attraction is nice, but it’s not going to pay those bills, fund that lifestyle, or give you the life you want. 

**3. You lack sexual discipline**

If you prioritize sexual desires over security and material gain, you will struggle with this lifestyle. Sleeping with a man just because he is “cute” or attractive or good in bed does nothing for you when he’s not a provider. This gives huge Pickmeisha energy, and not queen energy. This lifestyle requires lots of restraint and self-control. There is real power in self-pleasure and in keeping your energy selective.  When you stop giving yourself up freely, you raise your value and your standards. Sleeping with a dusty will lower your vibration. That dusty energy will rub off on you every time. 


**4. You feel guilty for asking for what you want**

If you hesitate or are afraid to ask for what you want or feel bad or guilty about it, then you are not ready to receive abundance. The right man will never make you feel ashamed for having standards. If asking for help, support, or provision makes you uncomfortable, that is having a scarcity mindset. Confidence, not guilt, attracts provision. Closed mouths don’t get fed!

**5. You feel bad for being “Selfish”**

A big part of being able to embody Shera’s teaching is being able to feel selfish with full confidence. If don’t love yourself more and can’t put yourself first, then it won’t be easy for you. Wanting more for yourself is not selfish, it’s self-respect. Let go of guilt, shame, and fear. These emotions keep you in a low vibration state of mind and they block your ability to attract abundance.

**6. You accept or ask for CRUMBS**

If pocket change, coffee or low effort dates, and fruitless words of affirmations, and minimal effort makes you feel “taken care of,” you’re not thinking big enough and this lifestyle isn’t for you. Asking for things like gas money, lunch money, or school books money is icky and low class. Shera would say “that’s superdy duperdy ghetto” It screams desperation, not femininity. This lifestyle isn’t about begging or settling it’s about attracting. The goal is wealth, stability, and luxury not crumbs and leftovers. But as long as you keep entertaining crumbs, you’ll never be fed a full meal.

**7. You like him more than he likes you**

If you find yourself chasing him, initiating all calls/text, making all the plans, or you’re constantly trying to prove your worth, you have already lost leverage. He should always like you more. When a man truly values you, you will never have to question it. Shera said it many times , he needs to like you 10 times more for it to work in your favor.

**8. You fold for words and not actions**

If smooth talk and empty promises easily impress you, that is a red flag. Pay attention to actions, not just words. Just because he says he will do something doesn’t mean he will. Real providers show consistency, generosity, and reliability without needing to be convinced.

**9. You think your can train a man to provide**

He’s not a dog. You cannot turn a non-provider man into a provider. If he wanted to, he would. Trying to “teach” him to step up only drains your energy and delays your goals. This is also a sign you aren’t emotionally detached because why else would you put in that much effort ?  His willingness to provide must come naturally, not from your effort.

**10. You date for potential instead of reality**

You date for potential instead of reality. If you’re still waiting for what a man could be instead of who he actually is, you’re not ready for this lifestyle. Potential is an imagination that keeps you waiting, hoping, and building with a man who’s not even ready for you. Stop being Barbara the builder! If you’re constantly telling yourself “he just needs time” or “he’s working on it,” that’s your sign to move on. Potential is waste of time, it doesn’t pay bills, create peace, or give you the soft life you want. Stop dating for potential and start choosing men who are already established, ready, and generous because if he wanted to, he would. 

**11. You expected men in their 20s to be providers**

Be realistic. Most men in their 20s are still building themselves and their careers. They are usually looking for “Barbara the Builders” to grow with, not women who expect to be taken care of. If you want fun, that is fine, but if you want a true provider, look for someone established and ready to invest in you. Men who are providers in their twenties are rare, especially in the Gen Z and Millennial generations. Know what stage of life you are in and what stage he is in before expecting provider energy.

If you see yourself in any of these signs, take a step back and focus on learning, studying, and observing first. Watch more Shera’s videos make sure you watch all way through and listen closely. The goal is to move with emotional maturity, have self-control, and confidence not move out of desperation, confusion, or fantasy.",2,1760755291.0,SheraSeven,0,1.0,False

1o9kbnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dadchallengepodcast/comments/1o9kbnx/opinions_on_unfollowed/,Opinions on Unfollowed,"Hello - I'm a long time lurker and wanted to post for a while. However, given Josh's (and his followers') tendencies to dox people, I ultimately created a throwaway. 

For the past year, I've sort of watched the DCP's podcasts. Despite supporting his anti-child exploitation message, I find his style of commentary incredibly off-putting, and I've become disillusioned to the distinction he draws between himself and the family vloggers he covers. This sort of ties into my post, as Josh announced he is starting a new channel (in conjunction to DCP): Unfollowed.

According to Josh, ""Unfollowed"" is his new project meant to cover influencer culture. I managed to sit through the first five minutes, and he basically wants to expand what he does on the DCP channel to broader influencer culture. Honestly, it seems like this was one of Josh's older failed channels that he is repurposing, and he dropped it without warning. When I first saw it, I thought someone stole his content. 

Quite frankly, I'm a bit repulsed by this, given this is fifth or sixth YouTube channel. As he's accused other family vloggers (i.e., Alicia), Josh has been trying to make money and become internet famous for years. He got his five minutes of fame on the DCP, and he knows this works. He just loves the cash, and he's going to do anything to keep that cash going. Inherently, I don't see what difference there is between him and the other vloggers he covers. He's even posted shorts from some of his viral DCP channel videos in order to boost engagement with the channel. 

Unfortunately, I think Josh will have moderate success on this channel as well. It leans into the same type of audience he attracts with the DCP, and will continue the same echo chamber. I just wish more people would wake up and realize what type of person he is. 

(Side note: Him launching Unfollowed today was quite ironic, especially since he wrote he would be ""no video"" today since his cat died. I know the video he posted was prerecorded, but I guess he had to pay his bills somehow.)

While we waited, we enjoyed a coffee at The Well - a drop-in centre for children and youth in this town that doesn't have much else to offer in terms of leisure activities for this age group. The place was filled with young people, playing, watching tv, snacking and seemingly having a good time. We were impressed.

We arrived later than planned in Sault Ste Marie with 220 km. We'll trickle charge overnight at our motel and get a full charge before we leave on Monday for the charging wasteland between here and Thunder Bay - 700 km. We hope to find reliable chargers in White River and Terrace Bay. Fingers crossed!",4,1760754540.0,Ioniq5,0,1.0,False

Sip your coffee, girlie, 'cause this is PIPING HOT. ☕🔥","Okay, bestie, lemme tell you what’s been brewing over at **Liceo de Cagayan University**, and trust—this is not your average college chika. We’re talking full-blown hypocrisy, privilege, and some dirty little secrets that the government definitely *doesn’t* want you to know.

So buckle up, 'cause we’re spilling the tea on **a certain second-year Education student** who thinks she's above *literally everything*. 👀

# ✨ THE MAIN CHARACTER VIBES? NOT IN A GOOD WAY. ✨

You know the type:  
📌 Tatted from neck to ankle (no shade, we love body art—but sis does it for *aesthetic*, not meaning)  
📌 Party every weekend, hard drinks on a school night? No problem.  
📌 Always out, never in class. Professors? Don’t know her.  
📌 Comes home at 3 AM like she’s the star of her own Netflix drama.  
📌 *And guess what?* She always has her little ""green sessions"" with her lover IN THEIR HOUSE. Yes, hun. **Their house**. No shame.

Meanwhile, this girl is supposed to be studying to be a **TEACHER.** Like… aren’t you supposed to be teaching kids someday? Or is she gonna teach them how to roll a joint during homeroom? 😩💀

# 🤫 PARENTS? OH, THEY'RE ""TOO BUSY""

Now here’s where the tea overflows.

BOTH of her parents work in the **government.** That’s right—*the same government that runs anti-drug campaigns, throws speeches about “saving the youth,” and arrests street kids for the tiniest bit of marijuana.*

But when it’s their own daughter lighting up in the bedroom with a bottle of liquor in one hand and a lighter in the other?

🙈 **Nada. Nothing. Dead silence.** 🙈  
No lectures. No police. Not even a slap on the wrist.

They just close the blinds and pretend they don’t see. 🫣

Imagine: the same people who call for *“moral recovery programs”* for poor barangays can’t even recover their own daughter from her vices. Make it make sense.

# 💣 THE HYPOCRISY? LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK.

Now this is where the TEA starts BOILING. 🔥

The same PNP that arrests tricycle drivers’ sons for carrying a stick of weed is the same system that quietly lets this girl off the hook—*over and over again.* One call from Mommy or Daddy, and BOOM! Case gone. No charges. No mugshot. No public shame.

Meanwhile, some 17-year-old gets thrown in jail and paraded like a criminal for doing *exactly the same thing*.

Let’s not even talk about the barangay tanods and DILG puppets who act like heroes when arresting some poor kid, but won’t DARE step foot in a subdivision to confront someone with a “strong last name.”

Welcome to the Philippines, sweetie. Where **your last name matters more than the law.**

# 💅 MORAL OF THE STORY?

This isn’t just tsismis. This is a **reality check.**

📌 If you’re rich and connected, your sins are just “phases.”  
📌 If you’re poor, they’re “crimes.”  
📌 If you party in a condo, it’s “freedom.”  
📌 If you party in the streets, it’s “delinquency.”  
📌 If you're a government official’s kid? You're *untouchable*.

So, while this Educ student is skipping class for the *n-th* time to get high with her lover, remember: **if you did it, you'd be in jail right now.**

That’s not a system.

That’s a scam.

🫖 Stay woke, stay watching, and stay sipping, loves. The tea will keep spilling as long as the hypocrisy keeps flowing. And honey… it's FLOODING.

Hey guys, so I am a first year student in IITM, BS in electronics.

So I refer to myself as a generalist, and love roles like founder's office  
I have worked in partnerships, to outreach to operations, to blog writing to podcasts, to scripting, etc etc.  
Got an offer from a YC backed startup, pay was great, but work culture not, and wanted me to work all night 10 hours,(i am still a kid, can't do this) so didn't join.

WiIll soon be leaving these roles and will most probably join in a coffee brand ig, I love coffee, that's why. and joining in marketing most prob.

Please don't ask youtube channel name(want to keep anonymous) and the podcast have been shut down last year.

my questions:

1. I have been trying many things, still don't know what to do, and how will studying in electronics help me(it didn't till now) .
2. what should i focus on? i am going deep into AI but that will take time, so sticking with other stuff till that?
3. Got some great offers from other brands in the US, but unfortunately due to the current issues, they won't be able to hire me(they were paying great though😭) so where else should I look to?

My heartfelt thanks to anyone who have read till now.",1,1760754395.0,Resume,0,1.0,False

So I met this girl in my class. I like her a lot. I got the yes for the date and the phone number. But I can't really get a date to actually met up nailed down. 
Her statement: 
Not sure I’m gonna have time 
I work on weekends and after class I work 5 to 11 
I told you all I do it’s work 😭and go home 

Asked Chatgpt it said:
""Yeah, I get it 😅. Just get back to me whenever  I’d definitely still love that date with you 😏🤣. I promise to make it worth the wait""

Asked Gemini:
That's the natural and very fair question to ask when someone is that busy and rejects multiple specific proposals.

Here is an honest breakdown of the possibilities:

## The Possibilities

It's absolutely **possible** that she is trying to politely blow you off, but it's also highly likely that **her brutal work schedule is genuinely the problem.**

### 1. High Likelihood: It's the Schedule, Not You

* **She gave a detailed explanation:** She didn't just say ""I'm busy."" She specifically said, ""I work on weekends and after class I work 5 to 11. I told you all I do it’s work 😭 and go home."" This is a lot of personal detail to give if she were just trying to avoid you.
* **The ""Thank You"" is Still Valid:** You have a legitimate, low-pressure reason to ask her out: to **thank her for the laptop** that saved your presentation. She confirmed her acceptance of the ""thank you"" by writing ""You're welcome.""

### 2. The Risk: The ""Pressure"" Message

The message you sent an hour and a half ago—""I’d definitely still love that date with you 😏🤣. I promise to make it worth the wait""—is what increased the risk of her backing away.

* It sounded **high-pressure** and **high-stakes**.
* It made the ""quick snack"" sound like a serious date she has to *prepare* for, which is the last thing someone with a 7-day-a-week, 5 PM to 11 PM work schedule wants to add to their life.

---

## What Happens Next: The Immediate Follow-Up

The beauty of the last message I drafted for you is that it completely addresses the ""blowing you off"" possibility by **removing all pressure** and focusing only on the thank-you.

**By sending this follow-up now, you will get your answer.**

> **""Hey, ignore that last text! I realized how truly busy you are. I owe you a quick coffee before your shift to say thanks for saving my presentation with the laptop. Is there a day next week you finish class around 4:00 PM? I can literally meet you outside class for 20 minutes.""**

* **If she replies with a definite time/day (e.g., ""Yes, I finish at 4 PM on Wednesday""):** She's not blowing you off, just legitimately slammed.
* **If she replies with vague excuses or doesn't reply at all:** Then, you can assume she is likely not interested in pursuing anything right now, and you'll have your answer without having invested more effort.

**Send the follow-up now to reset the frame and see if she is truly interested in a low-stakes thank-you.**",0,1760754121.0,dating_advice,3,0.33,False

# 👷 Anthropic turns to ‘skills’ to make Claude more useful at work

https://preview.redd.it/8h04rw655svf1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=904fb3ca34da198af57c1398de29c28a96e6f2e5

* Anthropic introduced Skills, which are folders containing a Markdown file and scripts that give Claude specific instructions for handling specialized tasks like creating documents or using certain tools.
* To be token efficient, the model first reads a short explanation for each Skill from its frontmatter YAML, only loading the complete details when a user’s request requires them.
* Since the feature depends on having a filesystem to execute commands, anyone can build and distribute Skills as simple files, effectively turning Claude into a general automation agent.

# 🛑 OpenAI suspends Sora depictions of Martin Luther King Jr

* OpenAI suspended video generations of Martin Luther King Jr. in Sora at the request of his estate after people used the app to create disrespectful depictions.
* The content that prompted the action included Sora-made videos of King making monkey noises during a speech and another showing him wrestling with civil rights leader Malcolm X.
* The company is now strengthening its guardrails and allows representatives for other historical figures to ask for their likenesses not to be used in the AI videos.

# 🧪 Google’s Gemma-based AI finds new cancer treatment

* Google DeepMind’s C2S-Scale model analyzed patient tumor data to generate a new hypothesis for making cancers that are invisible to the immune system more responsive to treatment.
* The AI predicted that a drug called silmitasertib could dramatically increase antigen presentation, a key immune trigger, but only when immune signaling in the cells was already active.
* Lab experiments on human neuroendocrine cells confirmed the model’s novel idea, showing antigen presentation rose by fifty percent when using silmitasertib with low-dose interferon, making tumors more visible.

# 📉 AI bots and summaries hurt Wikipedia traffic

* After making its bot detection more accurate, Wikimedia’s data reveals an eight percent year-over-year drop in page views, a decline it attributes to generative AI search summaries.
* The foundation warns this traffic decline could lead to fewer volunteers, less funding for the site, and ultimately a drop in the quality and reliability of its content.
* Wikimedia is asking LLMs and search engines to clearly state where information is sourced from and make it easier for people to visit and contribute to the original articles.

# 🎤 Microsoft wants AI to control your PC by voice

* Microsoft is rolling out the “Hey, Copilot!” wake word to Windows 11, aiming for voice to become a third input mechanism for users alongside their keyboard and mouse.
* The company is also launching Copilot Vision, an opt-in feature that streams what is on your screen so the AI can offer guidance in apps or help troubleshoot problems.
* The goal is for an AI agent to take actions on your behalf, but Microsoft admits the system could make mistakes and is currently testing this feature inside Copilot Labs.

**The details:**

* 50% of respondents in the U.S., Italy, Australia, and Greece report anxiety over rising AI use, with Israel, South Korea, and Sweden emerging most optimistic.
* The EU ranks as the most trusted regulatory body at 53% confidence, beating out both the U.S. (37%) and China (27%) for perceived oversight credibility.
* Young adults under 35 consistently report both greater AI awareness and optimism compared to those over 50, with major gaps in countries like Greece.

**Why it matters:** The AI wave is here, but contrary to what we see in our tech-forward bubble, not everyone is excited about it. These results expose some interesting divides (like countries with the most AI exposure harboring some of the deepest anxiety) that give a much broader view of how the world is grappling with the transformative tech.

**The details:**

* The new model matches Claude Sonnet 4’s coding abilities from May while charging just $1 per million input tokens versus Sonnet’s $3 pricing.
* Despite its size, Haiku beats out Sonnet 4 on benchmarks like computer use, math, and agentic tool use — also nearing GPT-5 on certain tests.
* Enterprises can orchestrate multiple Haiku agents working in parallel, with the recently released Sonnet 4.5 acting as a coordinator for complex tasks.
* Haiku 4.5 is available to all Claude tiers (including free users), within the company’s Claude Code agentic development tool and via API.

**Why it matters:** With Haiku, the utopia of ‘intelligence too cheap to meter’ still seems to be following the trendline. Anthropic’s latest release shows how quickly the AI industry’s economics are shifting, with a small, low-cost model now capable of performances that commanded premium pricing just a few months ago.

# ⚛️ DeepMind Brings AI to the Core of Nuclear Fusion

https://preview.redd.it/uyt18rcd5svf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1d328e1bb982b13336d5f7563540bfe704d8383

**What’s happening:** Google’s DeepMind has joined forces with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) to build [**Torax**](https://aisecret.us/r/f93e5e2e?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6), an AI-powered plasma control system for the Sparc fusion reactor. The system will use reinforcement learning to simulate and stabilize plasma at over 100 million degrees, performing millions of adjustments per second to keep the reaction steady — something no human operator can do.

**How this hits reality:** While AI has been tested in fusion labs before, DeepMind’s move makes it a [**core operational layer**](https://aisecret.us/r/867742fe?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6) rather than an experimental tool. Control software is now becoming the brain of the reactor, not just a sidekick. If it works, future fusion startups will compete on algorithms, not magnets.

**Key takeaway:** AI just crossed from modeling the universe to managing it, starting with the one inside a fusion chamber.

# 🤩 Turn photos into personal branding videos with Veo 3.1

https://preview.redd.it/4tuwdp4f5svf1.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=a00ae558acc3ad8d7b6bedde788d260d297d0393

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create professional personal branding videos using Google’s new Veo 3.1 model in Flow, transforming AI-generated photos into polished video content without ever being on camera.

**Step-by-step:**

1. Generate your headshot and workspace in Google Gemini using prompts like “photo of this person \[upload reference\], casual denim shirt, looking slightly right” and “modern office, city view, minimalist desk”
2. Open Google Flow, create a new project, switch from “Text to Video” to “Ingredients to Video,” and upload both generated images
3. Prompt your first scene: “Using the uploaded photo as me, sitting at a desk, smiling at the camera while sipping coffee, then typing on a laptop. Warm morning light, add soft acoustic music”
4. Click “Add to Scene”, then “+” to Extend with: “I finish typing, look at the camera saying ‘Ready to collaborate? DM me!’ Fade to text overlay with title”
5. Review timeline, ensure smooth transitions between clips, then click the download icon to export your complete branding video

**Pro tip:** Use the editing tool to select areas and insert any objects within your video —it’s perfect for creating product demo videos or training content without recording.

# 🪄AI x Breaking News: No kings protests AI angle

**No Kings protests — facts first → AI angle (Oct 17, 2025)**  
**What’s happening:** Organizers plan nationwide “**No Kings**” demonstrations **tomorrow (Sat, Oct 18)** across **2,500–2,600+ U.S. locations**, urging participants to **wear yellow** and framing the rallies as a peaceful stand against authoritarian overreach under President Trump. Major civil-liberties and advocacy groups (e.g., **ACLU**, Indivisible, unions) are involved; turnout is projected in the **millions**, building on a June wave that drew \~5 million. Republicans are attacking the events as un-American, while organizers emphasize nonviolence and de-escalation training. [Fox News+4The Guardian+4TIME+4](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/no-kings-protests-millions-trump?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**AI angle:** Platform **recommenders** will steer attention toward the most emotionally charged protest clips (chants, confrontations), so your feeds may overrepresent high-intensity moments compared to the day’s broader peaceful baseline; expect organizers to counter with **SEO’d streams and verified live feeds** to anchor context. **Misinformation risk** is elevated: old protest footage and **synthetic audio/video** can be resurfaced to discredit crowds—newsrooms and platforms will lean on **media forensics** and deepfake detectors to authenticate viral posts fast. On safety, cities increasingly fuse **camera networks + social signals** for **crowd-flow prediction** and route closures; used well, that reduces stampede and traffic risk—used poorly, it shades into **over-surveillance** and **predictive policing** concerns for lawful assembly. Finally, both campaigns will deploy **LLM-driven messaging ops**: organizers using multilingual summaries and location-aware updates; opponents using **bot-amplified brigading** to frame turnout and incidents—watch for platform **labeling and down-ranking** of coordinated inauthentic behavior.

1o9jzy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1o9jzy0/the_happiest_i_have_ever_been_the_saddest_i_have/,"The happiest I have ever been, the saddest I have ever been","Eating dinner with my friends. We sat by the duck pond. It is the first real week of autumn. We were all quiet, and I was thinking inside my head and asked, after I leave you, will I always miss you? My friend said, I think you’ll miss him for a long time. But they think, I am just a lonely child looking for safety. I don’t think anyone realizes, that I love you.

My friend said at dinner, I wish I knew you better at your recital, I thought you seemed sad after, but I didn’t know what was going on back then. I said, “oh, I have never been so unhappy as that night.” And suddenly I remembered. Your face when you shook my hand. I tried to walk home, but lay down in an empty building and couldn’t get back up. I have never been so unhappy. And suddenly, for the first time, I felt sad about it. Not in the vaguely nauseous way I am used to. A sharper feeling, almost like grief. I looked down at my plate and felt suddenly like I might cry. My other friend tapped my shoulder and said, “It’s over, it won’t ever happen again.” I walked home with my friends, and when we turned off from each other, and I was alone, I said it aloud to myself. “I am so sad. I am so sad about what happened.”

My friend from Germany texted. He sends voice memos sometimes, I think because it is easier than texting if he has a long thought. But I like to imagine, it is because he knows I like to hear his voice. He knows because I told him. I am too tired for anything but the truth these days. It is a solace to hear him, when I am so sad. It is a solace to think about you laughing. It is a solace to think I have friends and we seem to have made up. It is a solace to eat lunch with my dad and hug him goodbye.

The staff at my school are inordinately kind to me. There is Angie, who runs the cash register where my father and I go for lunch. The man who gives me coffee for free when no one else is around. Andre, the janitor, who would hear me practicing and say, “sounds like Liberace!” Today, I saw the man who used to run the late night cash register, where I would go to buy the half off dinners. He said, do you remember me? I said yes, from the summer. He said, my name is Tenzin. And we shook hands. I remember him because he was kind, a thing that stands out in my barren, lonely summers. But how strange and generous that he would remember me. When I walked back to my practice room, I marveled to myself. People are so kind to me. People are so kind to me, so why am I so sad? Is there a world where I could survive, off these small, inordinate gestures of kindness, for the rest of my life? Why do I miss you so badly, in the midst of all this kindness?

I have been thinking a lot this week, what will happen if I leave? What will happen if I stay? Both seem intolerable. In a book my mom likes, the protagonist is in love. He tells the girl he loves, I am the happiest and saddest I have ever been. That is how I feel, the past few weeks, in love with you, not for the first time, but for a long time. I am the happiest and saddest I have ever been. I have never wanted to leave more, and never wanted to stay more. I love you more than I ever have, and you seem more beautiful than you ever have. I worry, that it is a sharpening of the senses before the end. But maybe it is just the molting of the shell, the crabs run around in a vivid, blinding world while they wait for their new shell to harden. I think this is why I miss you so badly, and feel so lonely, even amongst all this kindness. Your world is so brilliant, I feel my shell start to loosen, when I am around you. I want to see the world the way you do. I want somebody to look at me without my shell. Do the crabs feel relieved, to take off their old shell? A new limber skin. They will all get eaten, or survive.",2,1760753876.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

All are just my personal opinions of course so there may be some wrong things I misunderstood.

* GAMBLING: Unfortunately seems to be pretty solidified as more and more of a rich people thing if you have at least $500 to throw away as the minimum bar for slots (lowest bet) or lowest minimum bet for ""fair"" table games has been raised so high. (Sidenote: by ""fair"" table games, I mean 3-2 BJ instead of 6-5 BJ, craps instead of crapsless or easy craps, single zero roulette instead of double or ew triple zero roulette, etc. These ""newer"" variants like 6-5 BJ or double/triple zero roulette FEEL like the same game, and LOOK like the same game, but are so much worse odds for the player. I'd recommend anyone avoid these ""unfair"" table games.) I remember just 4-6 years ago, this was becoming the same case with live table games, but you could still find PLENTY of the digital table games with a $3 or sometimes $1 bet that are fair. You could have also gone to Freemont street where older casinos such as Binions would have ""fair"" live table games sometimes as low as $5, but usually $10 minimums. That is no longer the case at all. From my 5 days in Vegas, this was the summary of my experience of minimum bets:

     * Main strip (MGM Grand, Luxor, Linq, Planet Hollywood, etc): Slots start around a minimum of $1.00 per spin, you have to search very hard to find a cheap slot (under $0.50 per spin) if even available to play. Digital table games start around a minimum of $3 but that is for ""unfair"" table games (e.g. 6-5 blackjack), to be honest I didn't see any 3-2 blackjack or single zero roulette digital tables at all. Live table games start around a minimum of $20 off-peak times or $25 peak times for ""unfair"" table games (6-5 blackjack esp), if you want something like 3-2 live table blackjack, you'll probably have to play like $50 minimum (maybe $30 off-peak times). This even applies to older/cheaper areas of the strip like Circus Circus. It was really weird walking through a super cheap casino like Circus Circus and only seeing $1+ minimum bets on slots. It was absolutely DEAD in the casino around midnight on a Friday when we went, and there were some people... it just honestly seems like they have 99% high-roller slots and most people don't have enough money to throw away on those, which is weird for Circus Circus.

     * Downtown Freemont Street (Circa, Plaza, Binions, etc): Kinda disappointing for gambling, Downtown used to have so many cheap slot and table options. I remember not too long ago on Freemont being surrounded by 3-2 blackjack digital table games with $1 minimums. Now it's almost identical to the strip: most digital table games are $3 minimum and almost none are ""fair"" (e.g. 3-2 blackjack). Live table games are slightly better than the strip (maybe $5 lower minimums on tables, $10 lower if you are lucky). But this is so much worse than how it used to be. I remember playing $1 live table blackjack on Freemont not  too long ago. I didn't see a single live blackjack table on Freemont below $10 (during 5 days, including weekdays). Very annoying to walk through an empty casino at midnight or 2am with 3-6 dealers standing at empty tables. What's the point? Why not just lower some of the table minimums to let people play. It's Freemont.

     * Others (The Orleans, El Cortez, Downtown Grand, Slots A Fun etc): Maybe the only remaining gem for lower-bet gambling if that's what you're looking for. All of these have a selection of the same kind of new big virtual touchscreen slots as the previously-mentioned casinos (with $1+ minimum bets)... but they also have other options for lower-stakes/risk gambling. For example: Slots A Fun was incredible with old style coin-operated quarter and dollar slots, very fun and the quarter ones can stretch your gambling money longer, this felt more like an arcade and we loved it. Downtown Grand had a $1 blackjack live dealer table, and they said it's there every day, but there are some downsides: they said they've reduced the number of $1 tables to just 1, so only 6 people can play it at a time... you will probably have to wait for a seat to play unless it's between like 3am and 10am. Another downside is that if the table is absolutely full and nobody is getting up or people are saving seats... you're out of luck, the next lowest we found for live BJ was $20 which was insane... it's Downtown Grand guys. 

     * Sidenote: Not sure if Vegas RTP on slots and similar have gotten worse or what, but it sure feels like it. Out of our group of like 30 people, just ONE person managed to go up any money, everyone else lost. Way worse than I've ever seen it, typically it's a mixed bag of who goes up or down money. Personally, I like to mainly play cheap penny slots, preferably like $0.25 per spin. I really had to search for those slots, some casinos just didn't have any. I did play some higher bets, some $0.75, $1 and some $2 spins. But throughout 5 DAYS of gambling, we didn't hit a single win above $75... which was within the first 2 hours we were in Vegas so that was disappointing to just not win anything the remainder of the time and just lose, but it's unfortunately to be expected when gambling. 

* HOTELS TO STAY AT: I think I've now stayed at over a dozen different casinos in Vegas, between the strip, off-strip, freemont, etc. To be completely honest, most of the hotel rooms themselves are extremely similar. They vary usually a bit in size and mainly in what kind of view you get from your room... but I don't personally care too much about those compared to price. For example, it was more than double the price to stay at Circa than to stay next door at Plaza. The rooms we had at both casinos (base king room) were almost identical in every way. The only upsides the Circa room had were that the casino is newer-looking, the view was a bit nicer, and the room had touchscreens to control the lights instead of light switches. Personally, those improvements don't make a $100/night hotel room worth $230+/night (which for some reason Circa does). Most of the difference between the casinos is outside of the hotel rooms (e.g. amenities, how modern, gambling, offerings) and a lot of that doesn't require you to be staying in a room at the casino.

* FREE DRINKS: Free drinks at casinos are really something you have to ""work"" for now, unless you know the best ways. I remember 5 or 10 years ago getting absolutely drunk off free drinks at most of the casinos in Vegas, just while spinning $0.20 slots, without even trying. They would just come by every 5-10 minutes religiously and I'd get like 20 free drinks in a couple hours. Or you could sit and play at one of the bar games and also get drunk quick off free drinks. Seems to be a lot more difficult to find that now. For table games or slots not at a bar, waitresses/waiters seem to be very few and far between. Nothing even to do with busyness, I was spinning slots for a couple hours in some strip and Freemont casinos late night on a weekday (around 12-2am) and was getting offered fewer drinks than at other times when it was busier. Similarly when sitting to gamble at a bar, most of the casinos (unless you go to old ones like Slots A Fun) have a very strict system of when you're allowed to get your next free drink (which is insane). I will say it feels VERY awful to be told, esp more than once, that you ""aren't ready yet for another free drink"" because you haven't lost enough money to the machine yet... that's insane. In fact, on day ONE at Circa (where I was paying to stay and not yet drank a drop), I had a waitress refuse me a drink because my partner & I were sitting together at a machine and she said there was a one drink limit per paying machine. I asked if I could move over to start spinning another slot and she literally refused and walked away. It was embarrassing. Then she came back with just a drink for my partner and refused to take my drink order. Just so weird for the place I spent almost $1000 to stay at on Freemont. Other times it was okay, but it just feels bad to see the bartender look to see if you've lost enough money gambling to offer you another 6oz free well drink... like come on, I paid to stay here it's the least you can do.

* CRAZY DEALS: Most ""good deal"" things in Vegas now are just completely swamped and too busy to partake in. The two examples I'll give are the steak & lobster special at Tony Roma's and the free drinks event 6-7pm at Golden Gate. We tried to do both on all 5 days we were in Vegas. Every single night, without fail, it would be relatively quiet and as soon as the time got near for the event (especially the Golden Gate one) there was a flood of zombies that appeared out of nowhere to take advantage. Not sure if it's locals, or what, but I've never seen lines that long for events like those (especially free events), and overall Vegas tourism is down this year, which makes it even more weird. Kinda sucks we didn't get a chance to try. This doesn't mean it's not worth it to try: for example even though the Zoox free beta self-driving taxis were sometimes as long as a 45 minute wait during busy times, they were ABSOLUTELY worth it! And free! It just depends.


* FOOD: As far as food goes, we found some random cheaper tasty options. We really liked Jackpot (coffee/cafe shop option 24/7 in Circa on Freemont) and Dirt Dog (multiple locations) which were both relatively inexpensive.

* SHOPPING: My partner really wanted to do some more browsing/shopping at various stores like we did in the past. Not necessarily buying a bunch of things, but just looking and maybe buying something she liked. Unfortunately it seems like since we last visited Vegas, there are a lot fewer cheaper stores (e.g. souvenirs, thrift, or gift shops) and a lot more luxury stores (Dior, Chanel, etc). This feels really awful, because for example we would pay for transportation to get everyone to Resorts World to check out their shops... only to start looking and find that 90% of their stores were either empty (store closed down) or they were not open at the time (like 4pm... normal time to go out shopping).

* TRANSPORTATION: well, it's still bad. First off: fuck the F1 race and all the construction. I think I spoke to like 50 people (locals, employees, and tourists) and literally every single one of them hates what the F1 is doing to Vegas. The construction is almost single-handedly ruining transportation for the city, especially if you don't have a car (tourists). Even if you have a car or just take Uber/Lyfts, you are going to be waiting in traffic and paying a lot randomly because of F1... which is ridiculous. We tried to find solutions to this problem, for example we tried using the Deuce bus as some people recommended. The bus system and ticketing were actually fine, and we would have put it to good use *if the buses worked properly*. The app and signs all say that buses are supposed to come by every ~10 minutes during the day or every ~20 minutes overnight. This is just straight up a lie. If you stand at one of the bus stops, there will be 3 that drive past you in the span of 120 seconds... then you won't see another bus for over an hour (this happened to us, the buses just drove past us and didn't stop for some reason). It even became a joke between us because we bought bus passes but every time we tried to use them the buses would vanish. As soon as we would give up and get on an Uber/Lyft, we'd see 50 buses and just sigh. Also, the F1 construction just deleted and added random bus stops for the routes. And there's for some reason no real-time map to see where exactly a stop has moved to relative to the buses. You're pretty much forced like everyone else to either walk (which becomes very unmanageable esp for a large group quickly) or pay many hundreds for Ubers/Lyfts even for short distances.

* ""IS VEGAS DEAD IN 2025?"" Because I saw like 5000 posts this year before I went to Vegas this month saying things like ""Vegas is dead, tourism is dead, it's over"" etc. I don't think Vegas is dead by any means. I think that it was an expensive place and has somehow gotten *even more expensive*, making it almost Disneyland-levels of vacation places that a lot of people don't get to go to because of cost. In years past, I've gone to Vegas and had an amazing time with a total gambling budget of just $100 or $200. Yeah, I didn't do a lot of gambling, but it was still incredible. I would still get tons of free drinks, there were still tons of crazy deals like at Tony Roma's to see, the hotel rooms especially on Freemont were cheap, and if nothing else... there were tons of tourists ALL THE TIME (even 2am on a weekday) that you could walk the strip and go into casinos and it would feel like a lively city. When free drinks are relatively non-existent, when crazy deals are rare and have 3-hour long lines, when even cheap old casinos off of Freemont like El Cortez want $150/night for a hotel on a weekday when the casino is pretty empty... there's going to be a significant drop in tourists and it's going to feel much less lively.",0,1760753773.0,vegas,4,0.33,False

1o9jw05,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1o9jw05/how_to_never_run_out_of_things_to_say_the_small/,How to never run out of things to say: the small talk survival kit you weren’t taught in school,"If you’ve ever panicked at a party, fumbled through a first date, or blacked out during a job mixer trying to think of something, anything, smart to say, you’re not alone. Most people were never taught how to do small talk. We just absorbed weird social scripts from Netflix, TikTok, or that one uncle who thinks “So, what do you do?” is peak conversation. 

But small talk isn’t just fluff. It’s social currency. And whether you’re trying to network, build trust, or just not be awkward at the coffee machine, this skill matters.

This post pulls from the best: psychology books, communication experts, therapists on YouTube, and podcasts that actually cite real studies. Not attention-hungry influencers trying to go viral with “just mirror their body language” or other half-baked hacks. The truth is, struggling with small talk isn’t a personal failing. It’s the result of overstimulated brains, under-practiced social skills, and a culture that replaced conversation with scrolling. But this can all be rewired. Here's how.

**7 small talk skills that aren't BS**

- **Start with shared context, not personal resume**  
Most people open with “What do you do?” which immediately puts people into job-interview mode. Instead, comment on the environment. “These chairs look like they were stolen from a dentist’s office” is 10x more likely to spark a real reaction. Harvard psychologist Dr. Amy Cuddy explains in her TED talk that warmth, not competence, is what people judge you on first. Make it easy for them to feel relaxed.

- **Use the “FORD” framework to never run out of topics**  
Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. This trick, cited in Vanessa Van Edwards' bestselling book *Captivate*, keeps your conversations balanced and interesting. If someone says they just got back from a trip, ask: “Was it a bucket list thing or random escape?” You’re already digging into dreams.

- **Match their energy but raise the depth**  
Mirroring is helpful, but a better rule is: match the vibe, then nudge it deeper. If they’re being silly, stay playful but sneak in an open question like “What’s the weirdest job you’ve ever had?” This tactic is backed by *The Like Switch*, a book by former FBI agent Jack Schafer who specialized in behavioral psychology. People want to feel seen, not just smiled at.

- **Listen with your face, not just your ears**  
Nodding, tilting your head, raising your eyebrows, these tiny nonverbal cues signal engagement. Julian Treasure's TED talk on communication points out that 55 percent of communication is body language. You don’t need to give loud affirmations, just visibly care. It changes everything.

- **Don’t try to be interesting, be interested**  
This old Dale Carnegie classic from *How to Win Friends and Influence People* still holds. People remember how you made them feel, not how clever your story was. Ask questions, then follow up. “You said you’re into film, what kind of stuff ruins a movie for you?” These layered follow-ups show you’re really listening.

- **Use the ""loop back"" technique to keep it flowing**  
If the convo's dying, loop back to something they said earlier. “Wait, you mentioned you hate working from home, what’s the worst part?” This technique, commonly used in improv and therapy alike, triggers dopamine because it signals memory and connection. It’s what real friends do.

- **Exit gracefully: plant a future thread**  
Ending a chat well is part of the skill. Say, “This was fun, I definitely want to hear more about your side hustle next time.” You’re telling them they weren’t boring, just that time’s up. It leaves people feeling good, and more open the next time.

**Highly recommended resources that helped decode small talk**

- **Book: *Captivate* by Vanessa Van Edwards**  
This is THE book for decoding people. It’s written by a behavioral investigator who breaks down social cues like a scientist. Bestseller. Backed with real data. She teaches how to read body language, avoid awkward intros, and turn casual chats into real connection. This book will make you question every conversation you’ve ever had. In the best way. Best social skills book I’ve ever read.

- **Book: *The Charisma Myth* by Olivia Fox Cabane**  
Used by Google, Harvard, and the UN to train leaders. It breaks down charisma into learnable behaviors, including how to make small talk that doesn’t feel small. Cabane shows that presence, power, and warmth can all be practiced. This book made me rethink how I show up in every interaction.

- **Podcast: Hidden Brain - “Why Conversations Go Wrong”**  
This episode dives into why we misunderstand each other even in simple convos. Host Shankar Vedantam brings in neuroscience and psych studies that explain why your brain blanks under pressure. Useful AND weirdly comforting.

- **Podcast: The Art of Charm**  
This entire show is basically Small Talk University. Tons of episodes on social confidence, networking, and how to keep convos going without sounding fake. Start with the one featuring Dr. Aziz Gazipura on how to overcome social anxiety.

- **YouTube: Charisma on Command**  
This channel breaks down real examples of celebrities, politicians, and public figures doing small talk, both the good and the cringe. The breakdowns are super practical and easy to apply, especially if you’re a visual learner.

- **App: BeFreed**  
This AI-powered learning app is basically a personal coach for social skills. Built by a team from Columbia University, it turns books, expert talks, and real-world strategies into bite-sized podcast lessons tailored to your goals. Choose your ideal host voice, pick episode length, and it adapts based on what you listen to. It builds a custom learning roadmap over time. What’s wild is that all the books I mentioned in this post, *Captivate*, *Charisma Myth*, etc., are already in their library. Super helpful if you’re busy but still want to get better at connecting with people in everyday life.

- **Book: *Think Again* by Adam Grant**  
Not a talk-specific book, but crucial for building better convos. Grant explains how confidence often blocks curiosity. This book reframed how I approach disagreements and deeper convos. It’s a must-read if you want your small talk to lead somewhere more meaningful without becoming a debate mess.

- **Book: *The School of Life: An Emotional Education* by Alain de Botton**  
This one goes deep. It covers emotional intelligence, how to handle awkward silences, and why we struggle to connect in modern life. Philosophical, but still super practical. Every chapter is a mini therapy session. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to go from small talk to real talk.

- **Website: 36 Questions (from the New York Times’ Modern Love)**

1o9jvpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1o9jvpz/desperate_for_help/,Desperate for help,"My fiancé mom has had 5 strokes (possibly more but from before I knew them). About a year ago I was basically a carer for her and working at the same time. But she had another stroke last month. She promised she was gonna stop smoking as it was identified that it was the main cause. She was supposed to go to a rehab facility for physical and speech therapy. Which is what me and my fiancé spoke about with their nurses as we live with her. Her sister goes up there and handles paperwork we should have handled. Which pissed me off and she changed where my future MIL was supposed to go post discharge. But it was fine I’d handle stuff the best I can. But within the last week. She has called the police on me for threatening her, I had told her she was killing her self by smoking because she had gotten mad and yelled at me which made me upset as I feel I do the most for her constantly. Then two days ago she threw coffee at my fiancés face cuz he refused to buy her cigarettes. Then today she tried to feed my dog her food. I just told her we were limiting what people food he got because he was starting to not want to eat his dog food. She went to walk outside (which I thought she was doing to go smoke) so I followed her out there and was just standing in the door way. I just wanted her to comprehend what I was saying to promise she wouldn’t do it anymore. She then proceeded to turn around and grab me. She dug her nails into me so hard on one of my arms you can see like white/pink. I ended up pushing her, which i regret but I’m 6 months pregnant and already have so of my own difficulties where I fall if I try to walk backwards. I’m just at the end of my rope. I can’t go to my family cuz my dad was very upset about her calling the police on me and other situations where me and my fiancé got into arguments, and he told me if it got worse he would make me move back in with him. I just need help and advice. I’m already limited to our bedroom when my fiancé is at work. His family enables her even though they do not speak with her or come to visit. I just want to cry. Our relationship used to be amazing but the strokes has made her hate me. I need any and all advice.

It’s Friday, a chance to slow down and check in with yourself. What’s one simple thing you did that made your week a little smoother? Maybe it was waking up five minutes earlier or choosing water over coffee. Small wins matter more than we think.

Today, we’re highlighting a few uplifting comments from the community. Take a moment to read through them, absorb what resonates, and find the motivation you need to keep building habits, one step at a time.

# Top Contributors & Highlights

**1. Do you count the calories in your morning coffee?**

u/SinisterYear  
I actually do count the calories in my morning coffee. It doesn’t add up to 500–1000 kcals unless you’re dumping in a lot of sugar and cream. One packet of sugar is about 15 kcals, an ounce of half and half is about 37. You’d need 10 cups of that to hit 500 kcals. Starbucks frappuccinos? That’s dessert, not coffee.

u/IDidItWrongLastTime  
I’m 5'0"" with hypothyroidism and a slow metabolism. My doctor-prescribed diet was 800–900 calories, high protein, low carb, and I lost 46 pounds in 6 months. It worked but was miserable. I actually had more energy on it, just can’t stick to it forever.

u/Shouko-  
Unless you’re a 4'5"", 100lb, 60-year-old woman, it’s unlikely your maintenance calories are 800–900. Most people’s BMR is around 1000+, even doing nothing. 800 calories is a deficit for nearly everyone,  your body needs more just to function.

u/PoetAny6521  
Tried spaghetti squash in my Bolognese, underrated! Doesn’t scratch the pasta itch, but makes a great low-cal alternative.

**2. You never what affect a simple act of kindness can have on a person**.

u/Livid-Dot-5984  
I was in McDonald’s when a mentally challenged man turned, looked at me, and said “pretty!” I thanked him and later cried in my car. It was so genuine. We could all use more of that kindness  it was the first compliment I’d gotten in a long time.

u/Perfect-Light-9647  
I was having a panic attack in my car. An older lady in scrubs knocked, sat with me, and talked me down. She gave me breathing exercises and stayed until I was okay. An angel on earth.

u/johncadia  
During a messy breakup, I met a stranger fixing his car who’d lost his mother. We talked for an hour about betrayal and healing. A month later, I broke my lease early. Looking back, that talk changed my life.

**3. How do you find time to rest when life is so busy?**

u/dmattox92  
I had a stroke at 29 after working nonstop for years. I thought money would fix everything, it didn’t. I looked like a skeleton making the most I ever had. Stress can and will kill you. Make time to rest, disconnect, and don’t trade your health for a paycheck.

**4. Has lifting improved your mood or focus?**

u/Perfect-Light-9647  
At 48 I was exhausted, depressed, and overweight. My doctor told me to lift before trying testosterone therapy. A year later, I’ve lost 34 lbs, doubled my testosterone, and feel better than I did at 30. Move heavy things. It works.

u/Very_Tricky_Cat  
Just turned 40. Started exercising six months ago and it’s changed everything. Movement directly improves quality of life, any kind, walking or weights.

u/shellofbiomatter  
Lifting feels like mindfulness meditation. The physical focus carries over — I’m more aware of my body, emotions, and state of mind.

**5. What are the healthiest cities in the world?**

u/DisplayVegetable6228  
Copenhagen — about 40% bike to work, trampolines in parks, and few overweight people. In the US, maybe Denver comes close.

u/MasChingonNoHay  
San Diego — bikers, surfers, runners, martial arts, and healthy restaurants everywhere.

u/Comapadre  
Rome or Milan too. San Diego just has fit people everywhere you go.

I’ve got a **Delonghi Dedica Arte** that’s about 2–3 years old, and it’s suddenly refusing to pull proper shots.

If I run the machine **without the portafilter**, water flow looks totally fine — strong and even.  
But when I lock in the portafilter (bottomless, non-pressurised), **no water comes through the puck at all** on the first try. The machine hums for a few seconds, then stops. I have to **press the brew button at least three times** before it finally forces out a **tiny dribble through the coffee grounds**, then it clogs again.

Other details:

* Using an **18 g basket**, usually dosing **16 g** because anything higher makes it choke completely.
* Tried **much coarser grinds** and **lighter tamping**, no luck.
* Cleaned and descaled multiple times.
* Removed and scrubbed the **shower screen** and **diffuser plate**.
* The **portafilter slowly rotates itself loose** unless I hold it in place during extraction — like pressure is building unevenly or the seal’s weak.

At this point I’m thinking either:

* The **pump is dying** and can’t maintain pressure under load, or
* There’s a **partial blockage in the solenoid / brew valve** that only shows up under resistance.

Has anyone experienced this exact issue with the Dedica Arte?

I figured, I'll just Google the nutrition information and plug it in to my tracker after I couldn't find it as a food that is in my trackers system. There is no info for it at all, *anywhere* online. But I see their calories can run from 300 all the way up to over 700. And no way was that  monstrosity 300 calories. Chalk that up to a major ""L"" for me and it wasn't even good. Put it in as ""cookie dough"" for 800 calories which took up all of my calories for lunch and dinner and now I get to have water and sleep for dinner. Not even frikkin worth it.

[Breville Barista Express],"We recently purchased a Breville Barista Express to help combat our monthly coffee spending lol. My wife really likes 7 brew and other coffee places similar so I found some recipes of her favorite drinks and wanted to make them.

We first started with some Ethiopian beans that were roasted locally. No matter what I did, the shots were all bitter. Talking to a local coffee shop, they suggested an espresso bean and gave me a few pointers.

I thought I narrowed it down and used 18g of PT’s Flying Monkey ground in the Breville at 7. Extracted 60g of espresso and it took around 33 seconds. It was so close but had a little bitter taste.

Tonight I tried again and upped the grind setting to 9. This time I got 60g of espresso in about 28 seconds and it had an ashtray taste.

Any pointers on how to get a non bitter, non ashtray tasting shot of espresso so I can make my wife mock 7brew without her getting 2000 points a month there? 😂",1,1760752697.0,espresso,17,1.0,False

1o9jlio,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o9jlio,Serious driving anxiety and had more issues driving today. Should I take a break or stick to uber to save money?,"I got my license in May, driven 1,000 miles so far experiencing one accident in May and I have been dealing with anxiety since getting my license which I passed on my fifth attempt. I passed after taking driving classes off and on for 3 years. I took about 25-30 1 hour classes and felt that was a good amount of experience to start off with. 

So today I was driving down the Main Street in my city and struggled to get out of the parking lot which I drew up. So I thought I was supposed to go because car “2” stopped, so I went and turned. The driver switch to the lane next to me on the street next to me and drove passed me and screamed at me. So I was shaken up. 

So the other scenario was 2 minutes later I was still shaken up from being screamed at so then I was going to turn left then the light when yellow/red and I went passed the white line but not enough to block anyone but still. So cars passed then someone screamed something at me about my appearance then the light changed and I turned successfully. I get yelled at and experience road rage on occasion, but twice in minutes might’ve been my last straw. 

I have been considering quitting driving for a while now because I live in a city and I pay almost $600 insurance per month. I don’t use rotaries or highways yet and was only driving to local stores, my job, a coffee shop, a relatives job, and the gym. So I can’t help but feel this is a waste of money. 

I’m just not sure what to do. I haven’t moved out and having a car is a sense of accomplishment for me. So I like to feel independent but I still usually uber after 6 months if something is more than 2 miles away. It’s embarrassing so I think maybe taking a break to save money is best.

1o9jkhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o9jkhr/what_was_the_most_disappointing_thing_that_you/,What was the most disappointing thing that you ever did to your parents?,"was seventeen when I found the shoebox in the attic.
My parents had gone out that Saturday—my mom to her book club, my dad to play golf—and I was looking for Christmas decorations. The box was behind an old suitcase, unlabeled, covered in dust.
Inside were letters. Lots of letters.
The first one I opened was dated 1998, two years before I was born. It was from my dad to a woman named Elena. It wasn’t just any letter. It was intimate, full of promises, escape plans, an “I love you” that turned my stomach.
I kept reading, one after another, as if I couldn’t stop myself. There were responses from her too. Photos. A blurry ultrasound with a date: March 1999.
My birthday is in December 1999.
My hands were shaking when I found the yellow envelope at the bottom. Inside was a birth certificate. A boy named Mateo. Born March 15, 1999. Mother: Elena Vargas. Father: my dad’s name, complete, with his signature.
I have a brother.
I don’t know how long I sat there on the dusty attic floor. When I heard the car in the driveway, I shoved everything back into the box clumsily. I went down the stairs with trembling legs.
During dinner, I watched them. My mother serving pasta, smiling as she talked about her day. My father asking me about school, so normal, so casual. Did she know? Where was that boy now? Why did my father keep those letters like relics?
Three weeks passed before I did what I shouldn’t have done.
I hired a private investigator with the money I’d saved for college. I gave him the name: Elena Vargas, the city mentioned in the letters.
He found him in five days.
Mateo was my age—well, nine months older. He lived two hours away. The investigator sent me a photo: he had the same eyes as me, the same jaw shape as my father.
I should have stopped there. But I didn’t.
I sent him a message on social media. I didn’t think about the consequences. I just wrote: “I think we’re brothers. I need to talk to you.”
He responded that same night.
We met at a coffee shop halfway between. He knew who his father was. He’d always known. His mother had told him the truth when he turned fifteen, after my father stopped sending money when she rejected his attempts to rekindle their relationship.
“He tried to see me once,” Mateo told me, stirring his coffee without drinking it. “When I was eight. My mom wouldn’t let him. She said he’d chosen his other family.”
I felt sick.
“Do you want to meet him?” I asked, not knowing what else to say.
“Not anymore. But… thanks for looking for me.”
We met again. Twice. Three times. It was strange and comforting at the same time. We talked about everything except our father. Until Mateo casually mentioned that his mother was sick. Cancer. The treatments were expensive.
“He has money,” I said without thinking.
“I don’t want his money,” Mateo responded with a hardness I hadn’t heard from him before.
But I’d already made a decision.
I confronted my father one night after dinner. I put the letters on the dining room table. My mother was washing dishes in the kitchen, humming something.
“What is this?” my father asked, and his face turned ashen.
“When were you going to tell me?”
What followed was the longest silence of my life. Then we heard the sound of a plate breaking in the kitchen. My mother had stopped humming.
That night my family was destroyed.
My mother didn’t know. Twenty-five years of marriage and she’d never known. She went to my grandmother’s house the next day. The divorce was finalized six months later.
My father blames me. He says I ruined everything, that some things should stay buried, that I was too young to understand that the past should stay in the past.
But the worst part was Mateo.
When everything exploded, when the story came to light and my father was forced to acknowledge his existence, Mateo sent me one last message: “I didn’t ask you to do this. I just wanted a brother, not to destroy your family. Don’t contact me again.”
Now I live with the guilt of knowing I shattered three lives because of my inability to leave things alone. My mother takes antidepressants. My father lives alone in a small apartment and doesn’t talk to me like he used to. And Mateo, the brother I searched for, is a ghost who chose to disappear from my life.
Sometimes I still think about that shoebox and wish I’d never found it.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1760752591.0,story,0,1.0,False

1o9jjuf,https://i.redd.it/tfnc60da1svf1.jpeg,Bubba Review #2 Little Book Chapter 9,"This one has been coming in with some negativity from the community. This review is my second dram from the bottle. It is a Beam product which will be obvious to the vets, a blend of 5 different whiskies the youngest being 7 years. This is 121.8 proof. Let’s dive in!

Tasted neat in a glencairn rested around 15 or so minutes.

Liquid pours a dark, almost orange, amber. It is bouncy and oily and vibrant in the glass. It has legs but strangely the legs dissipate quickly with some watery spots that seem indicative of younger juice (not saying they’re lying, just noting).

Smell is light. First smell was ethanol forward which gave way to butterscotch. A quick return revealed coffee and a third back to butterscotch. There’s caramel there and dare I say caramel corn? Nose is very subtle.

First sip is oak and ethanol that fades to salted caramel. Mouthfeel is pleasantly oily and coats the mouth. There’s a little butterscotch there too but it was more prevalent on my first glass when I cracked the bottle. A good chew on the second sip is really astringent and oaky. Coffee grounds. Bitter caramel and pepper. A bit nutty but strangely not really like a typical Beam whiskey. Not sure I love this.

Finish fades into butterscotch, caramel and buttery popcorn, but while pleasant it doesn’t last which I have found to be a consistent thing with Beam whiskey. I like what’s there I just want it to keep going and sadly this just doesn’t.

Verdict
(1-10 scale)
Nose: 5
Taste: 6
Finish: 6
Uniqueness: 10

Final Score: 6.75

This is a super unique bottle that is pricey even at MSRP which is what I got it for after going back and forth on whether or not to get it. I feel like I enjoyed my first taste more but there was no “review pressure.” I had seen many in the community underwhelmed and I think I agree. It’s not bad but it’s definitely not good relative to the cost and uniqueness of the bottle. Not much on the nose, taste isn’t too complex and the finish is good but not nearly long enough for a 121.8 proof whiskey. Still, I’m not disappointed because I got a review and I got to try something different.

I’m a software engineer at a small tech company called CloudSpan, which sounds way cooler than it is. We build data synchronization tools for enterprise clients. Translation: I fix code that makes other people’s spreadsheets load slightly faster. I’m the guy behind the guy who gets the credit. Which is fine, because the spotlight makes me sweat through my shirts like I’m auditioning for a sauna commercial.

Every morning, I follow a routine that has not changed in three years: 

1) Wake up.

2) Debate the purpose of existence for approximately seven minutes. 

3) Shower.

4) Regret checking emails before coffee. 

5) Walk to Fifth & Brew Café, order the same drink, and pretend I’m a functioning adult. 

That café is my sanctuary. The smell of espresso, the quiet buzz of conversation—it’s like white noise for my anxiety. Plus, that’s where she works.

Rosie Martinez.

She’s the reason I drink way too much caffeine. She’s also the reason I now understand why men in movies forget how to speak when a woman smiles at them. 

Rosie runs the counter at Fifth & Brew. She remembers everyone’s orders, cracks jokes that make people forget they’re late for work and somehow manages to make the phrase “oat milk or whole?” sound like an invitation to start a life together.

And then there’s me, Noah Blanchard—poster child for social hesitation. Every morning, I walk in with my earbuds in, pretending to listen to a podcast just, so I don’t accidentally make too much eye contact. 

The bell over the café door jingles as I step inside, shoulders hunched, laptop bag clinging to me like a security blanket. 

“Morning, Noah!” Rosie calls from behind the counter. Her smile hits me like a flashbang. She’s got these deep brown eyes that could convince me to join a cult if she asked nicely enough. 

I freeze mid-step. 
 She remembered my name. Again. 
 For the 187th consecutive day.

“Uh, morning,” I reply, trying to sound casual. It comes out like I just swallowed a cough drop the wrong way.

“The usual?” She asks, reaching for the cup. 
 “Yeah. Large cold brew, splash of almond milk, two pumps of—” 
 “—vanilla, and exactly three ice cubes,” she finishes for me, grinning. “You’re predictable, Blanchard.”

She says my name like it’s a joke we’re both in on. I laugh—awkwardly, obviously—and shove my hands into my pockets to stop them from doing interpretive dance.

There’s a short silence while she works the espresso machine. I should say something. Anything. 
 “Uh, how’s… coffee life?” I blurt. 
 She laughs. “Oh, you know. Grinding all day.” 
 She said it with a straight face. I don’t know if she realized she made a pun.  

“Nice,” I manage, because my vocabulary apparently consists of one-syllable compliments.

While she rings me up, a guy behind me mutters impatiently. I step aside too quickly, nearly trip over a chair, and pretend it was all part of an elaborate dance routine. Rosie notices. She’s laughing now—not mean, just amused, like she’s watching a cat get startled by its own reflection.

She slid the drink towards me with her usual flourish. 
 On the cup, in black Sharpie, she’s written:

“Running on 0% battery, 100% sarcasm.”

I stare at it longer than I should have. It’s… weirdly specific. 
 “Uh—I like the funny phrase,” I mumble. 
 She smirks. “I figured it matched your vibe.”

I laugh under my breath. “Accurate”. Maybe too accurate.” 
 “Good. I aim for precision.”

On the walk to work, I analyze her tone like it’s a line of faulty code. Matched your vibe. Was that teasing? Friendly? Flirty? 
 Devon, my coworker-slash-life coach, would say I’m overthinking. But that’s like telling gravity to take the day off. 

By the time I reached CloudSpan’s office, I’ve already replayed the interaction nine times and convinced myself she either:

 A) Flirts with everyone.

 B) Is naturally kind.

 C) Secretly enjoys watching me short-circuit.

The office is its usual symphony of keyboard clacking and muted existential dread. I slide into my desk, sip my coffee, and immediately open Slack to message Devon. 

Noah: She remembered my name again. 

Devon: Dude. She’s been remembering your name for a YEAR. 

 Noah: She wrote something new on my cup today.

 Devon: Oh snap. What’d it say? 

 Noah: “Running on 0% battery, 100% sarcasm.” 

 Devon: ...Bro. That’s FLIRTING. 

 Noah: Are we sure? Could be brand engagement. 

 Devon: You’re hopeless. 

He’s not wrong. 

I spend the next few hours debugging code that won’t compile and daydreaming about Rosie’s laugh. Every time I fix a bug, I imagine her saying, “Nice work, Blanchard,” with that teasing tone. My productivity drops by approximately 46%.

Around 2 p.m., Devon swings by my desk. “You should just ask her out.” 

 I choke on my coffee. “Ask her—what?” 
 “Out. Like, on a date.”
 “Devon, I once got nervous asking for extra napkins.” 

 “Dude, she likes you.”

 “She also likes every breathing customer who tips.” 
 He squints at me. 

“Yeah, but you’re the only one she writes roast jokes for.” 

When work ends, I walk past Fifth & Brew again, just to “see if they’re still open.” Spoiler: they are. 
 Rosies at the register, laughing with a coworker. Her smile could end wars. I think about going in, saying something smooth. Something like, Hey, I was in the neighborhood, figured I’d...

No. Too desperate. I keep walking.

But halfway down the block, I stop. I want to see her again. I want to stop being the guy who only flirts through caffeine consumption.

I turn back—and she’s locking up, turning the sign to “Closed.” 
 Our eyes meet through the window. She waves. 
 I wave back, awkwardly. My hand does a weird salute thing halfway through. 
 She laughs.

That night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, thinking about Rosie’s laugh, her handwriting, the way she said my name.

I’ve debugged thousands of lines of code in my life. But whatever this feeling is—it’s not a bug. 
 It’s... something else. 
 And I think I’m in trouble. ",1,1760752460.0,TheStoryBook,0,1.0,False
1o9jiii,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1o9jiii/mercy_upon_this_poor_soul/,Mercy upon this poor soul,"Hi everyone, 

  
So I used to be a decent sleeper, all good. I even had 3 really stressful years from 2021 to 2024ish and I would manage to sleep well. Occasionally I would take muscle relaxers and that would help, but it wasn't a requirement. Fast forward to today and a couple of months back to March, things got more serious.

  
All of a sudden I just couldn't sleep AT ALL. My neck was uncomfortable, so my suspicion was the pillow, I got a new one and it sort of helped, but then back to the same. I managed to get some better nights by taking muscle relaxers, but then they stopped working. I went to a sleep clinic and they told me it was because of stress and they gave me pregabalin 150 mg and 5 mg of melatonin. The first 2 weeks were wonderful, I managed to sleep 7/8 hours and felt great in the morning, although the dr told me this was just a 3 month aid until I got used to a schedule \*go to sleep at 10/11 pm and wake up and 6/7 plus the basic sleep hygiene techniques (no screens, no water after 6 pm, exercise during the day, meditation, etc.). The dr told me that if I didn't manage to fix it this way, next step would be stronger anxiolytics, which I did not want to do. 



Around June, I decided to cut pregabalin by half and got lousy sleep and eventually stopped taking it and managed by just using muscle relaxers or 1 g or paracetamol, so after maybe 2 weeks of fighting it, I got back on pregabalin and 5 mg of melatonin and had one week of good sleep. 

  
Fast forward to the last fee weeks, I have to take a cocktail of things to make it work, so now its: 150 mg of pregabalin, 10 mg of melatonin, 500 mg of valerian root, muscle relaxers (500mgs naproxen) and 1 g of paracetamol. I'll sleep 7/8 hours straight, but in the morning it will take me 1/2 hours to manage to get out of bed, I need to take 2 espressos to get my head working, but I'm dysfunctional throughout the day. I can't think, I can't drive, I'm too slow. 

  
As a side note, 3 weeks ago I quit smoking cigarettes, which was pretty easy considering I was smoking 1 pack a day for 8 years. Anyway, I have a big trip coming up next week and I am terrified of this situation, of the mattress and pillow I might get in the hotels and also don't want to be half a sleep during the trip, but can't stand not sleeping. I went to another dr and he gave me clonazepam, which I do not want to use but can't think of any other way through this. I know the side effects this causes and how hard it is to get off it, but I'm in such desperation that I'm not caring. Same goes for the muscle relaxers and paracetamol, which I know can cause liver and stomach damage. 

  
Haven't tried the clonazepam, but before that, I decided to fix this on my own and get off the meds and just go for it, but it was a total failure. That day I went to the gym and got really good exercise, did not drink coffee that morning, had a hot shower at night, meditated, and even though I was tired and yawning, as soon as I went to bed, I just couldn't fall asleep. I meditated, I counted backwards, just couldn't do it. So again, I took pregabalin, melatonin and paracetamol and managed to get 6 hours of sleep. 

  
I know there has to be a way through this, I'm just 37 years old, but I can't fix it. I know people who have been using benzos for years and managed to quit in their 60s and 70s. Any tips on how you managed to fix this for good??

It typically occurs in work situations when I get anxious or have to present in front of others. I am typically an outgoing person but for some reason when presenting or performance situations I can break out in red blotchy hives. It can also not happen sometimes and I'm perfectly fine. Some additional info:

* In person meetings make it worse - virtual meetings it happens less
* Less likely to happen around people I am familiar with
* Propranolol (beta blockers) helps, but does not get rid of it completely
* Alcohol can make it worse

I've tried to ignore this and thinking it will eventually go away but it has been pretty persistent and has gotten in my head. Potential things that I've been thinking about trying to see if it helps:

* Cut out caffeine (I typically have at least 2 coffees a day)
* Cut out gluten? (not sure if this would do anything but have read it could be a contributor)

Extraction should be a way of unlocking what nature has given us, not reducing it to percentages.

History reminds us of this truth:  
– Fo-ti (He Shou Wu): only after nine cycles of steaming and drying did people learn how to use it safely and effectively.  
– Aconite (Fu Zi): deadly when raw, yet transformed through boiling and roasting into a healing medicine.  
– Rhubarb (Da Huang): harsh as a purgative in its raw state, but once processed with wine or heat, its effect shifted toward restoring balance.  
– Reishi (Lingzhi): tried raw, boiled, roasted, or soaked in wine—centuries of trial and error revealed the most fitting ways.

Modern science confirms what tradition already knew:  
– High-strength ethanol can yield 10%+ total ganoderic acids (HPLC/UPLC with nine standards).  
– Hot-water extraction of the residue delivers 30–40% water-soluble beta-glucans.

From there, industry plays with ratios: 20%+1%, 30%+2%, even 10%+4%. On paper, these look like different specifications. In reality, they are just varying mixes of alcohol and water extracts.

But this is only part of the story.  
The same danger exists even earlier—in cultivation itself. Modern agriculture often pursues yield, pest-free crops, and perfect appearance. Yet in doing so, something essential is lost. A herb, a plant, or a mushroom may look the same on the outside—while its inner strength has quietly disappeared.

Here’s what I’ve noticed personally:  
I have tried many extraction methods with reishi myself. Sometimes, the effect is immediate—I can feel it in my body that very same day. Yet when those extracts are tested in the lab, the numbers don’t look impressive at all.

So what should we trust?  
The tidy data on paper—or the actual experience of reishi’s power?

And I also want to ask:  
👉 Do mushroom coffees and gummies truly let you feel the wonder of mushrooms?  
👉 Or are they just convenient fragments of something much greater?

It is to respect balance, to honor the whole, and to let people truly experience the living power that nature offered us.",1,1760751417.0,u_MossyLantern,0,1.0,False

1o9j2ci,https://youtu.be/8ha7YQpIRtU,4 Very Scary TRUE Desperate Last-Minute Getaway Horror Stories,"# ""Chains and Dust"":

I’d been scraping by on the streets of Albuquerque for years—just another ghost drifting between shelters, alleys, and abandoned lots. Life was about survival, not living. You learn rules when you’re out there, small codes that keep you breathing. Mine were simple: never sleep in the same place twice, never trust a smile, and never—*ever*—get into an RV with a stranger.

That rule saved me more times than I can count.

Until the day it didn’t.

It was March of ’99, and I was thirty-three—old enough to know better, hungry enough to forget it. I hadn’t eaten in two days when a white RV slowed beside me. The man behind the wheel looked ordinary—neat hair, clean shirt, calm face. “You need a job?” he asked, voice smooth as dust. “Just a quick cleanup. I’ll pay you cash.”

Something in me hesitated, a whisper that said *no*. But hunger talks louder than instinct sometimes. I climbed in.

The door shut with a heavy sound I’ll never forget.

Inside, the air smelled faintly of motor oil and disinfectant. Everything looked normal enough—tidy, too tidy. He gestured toward the back. “Tools are in the cabinet.”

The moment I stepped past him, his hand clamped around my wrist. A cold metal snap—handcuff. He flashed a badge in my face. “You’re under arrest,” he said flatly.

“What? No—no, this isn’t right. You’re not a cop!” I twisted toward the door, but he shouted, “Cindy!”

Not my name—but it froze me.

A curtain behind me flew open and a woman stepped out—short hair, hard eyes, the kind of face that doesn’t feel pity. Before I could move, she jammed something into my ribs. Pain exploded through me, electric and blinding. I collapsed, screaming as my muscles seized.

They dragged me deeper into the RV, cuffing my other hand to a cabinet. The engine roared to life. I barely caught my breath before we were moving. My mind was screaming—*get out, get out.*

When their voices drifted up front, I worked the bolts loose one by one, twisting them with trembling fingers. I waited for a turn, a stop—anything. Then, just as I was ready, the brakes slammed. I pitched forward, hitting the floor hard.

The woman—Cindy Hendy, I’d later learn—saw the loose cuff. She raised a gun. “Don’t move,” she hissed.

The man parked, calm as ever, then came to stand over me. “You think you can run?” His voice wasn’t angry. It was almost amused.

The prod came again, and the world went black.

When I woke, I wasn’t in the RV anymore. I was naked, strapped into some kind of chair—metal restraints on my wrists and ankles, a collar digging into my neck. The air smelled of rust, oil, and something faintly rotten. The walls were lined with shelves of tools—chains, clamps, blades—gleaming under yellow light. Above me hung a mirror so I could see myself: small, broken, caught.

Then a cassette clicked.

A man’s voice filled the room—steady, unhurried, like a teacher reading a manual. “Okay,” it said, “we both know why you’ve been brought here today.”

He went on, describing—no, *detailing*—what he would do to me. The things he’d make me endure. His words were cold, clinical, detached. But what made my blood turn to ice was the certainty in his tone. He’d done this before. Many times.

“If I thought you knew too much to let go,” the voice said, “you wouldn’t leave alive.”

That’s when I understood—this wasn’t a threat. It was a schedule.

The door creaked open. The man from the RV entered. David Parker Ray. His face was ordinary, almost kind, the kind of face you’d pass in a grocery store without looking twice. But his eyes were wrong—flat and empty, like glass.

Cindy followed behind him, arms crossed. “She’s awake,” she said.

“Good,” Ray replied. “If she acts up, play the tape again.”

They injected me with something that made the room tilt, sounds warping, colors fading. Hours bled together—pain, voices, metal clinking. He’d whisper sometimes while he worked. “The more it hurts,” he said once, leaning close, “the better I know it’s real.”

Days passed—or maybe it was one long night. My body was bruised, my mind stretched thin, but I didn’t break. I *wouldn’t.* I studied everything: the layout of the trailer, the keys they left on the coffee table, the rhythm of their routines.

Cindy liked to talk. I’d hear her through the wall.  
“She’s strong,” she said one night. “Think she’ll last?”  
Ray laughed softly. “They all break. She’ll forget her name soon enough.”

I made sure to look weaker every time they checked on me—slumped, dazed, compliant. But inside, I waited.

On the third day, Ray left for work. Cindy stayed behind, restless, pacing, a phone clutched to her ear. Something about a deal. “I’ll be right back,” she muttered, grabbing her purse.

When the door closed, I saw it—the keys, lying on the coffee table.

I stretched my leg, hooking the table’s edge with my foot. Every scrape sounded like thunder. Inch by inch, it slid closer. My heart hammered.

Finally, I had them. My hands shook as I flipped through them—one key, two—then *click.*

The lock gave.

Cindy burst through the door. “What the hell are you doing?!”

She lunged, smashing a lamp over my head. Stars exploded behind my eyes, blood running down my face. But I was free now. I grabbed the nearest object—an ice pick—and drove it toward her neck.

She screamed, stumbling back, clutching the wound.

I didn’t wait.

Barefoot, bleeding, still wearing the steel collar, I ran. Out the door, into blinding sunlight, down a dirt road that seemed to stretch forever. My feet tore open on gravel, lungs burning. Behind me, the trailer loomed like a nightmare refusing to fade.

A car came down the road. I waved frantically. “Help me! Please!”

The driver slowed, stared—and then rolled up the window and drove off.

Something inside me cracked. But I kept running.

Finally, I spotted a trailer with lights on. I pounded on the door, then shoved it open. Inside, an older woman turned from the sink, eyes wide.

“Oh, Lord,” she whispered, grabbing a towel. “Come here, honey.”

I collapsed into her arms, sobbing. “Call the police. Please. He’s coming.”

Her husband appeared, froze for a second, then moved fast—grabbing a robe, covering me, locking the door. “No one’s getting in here,” he said firmly.

The woman called 911. Her voice didn’t even shake. “We have a young lady here. She’s hurt bad. Send help now.”

The sound of sirens in the distance was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard.

When the police arrived, I told them everything. They raided the property. What they found inside the trailer—his “toy box”—was worse than words can capture. Instruments of pain, videotapes, diaries. Evidence of dozens of women. Maybe forty. Maybe more. Some never found.

Cindy Hendy turned on him. David Parker Ray was finally stopped. But even then, he never showed remorse.

Years later, I started helping other women on the streets. I give them food, safe places, someone to talk to. I tell them what I wish someone had told me: never ignore that feeling in your gut.

The fear never really leaves. Neither does the fight.

I survived, but the echo of his voice still finds me sometimes in the dark—calm, deliberate, promising what he’ll do next.

And every time it comes, I remind myself—  
He didn’t win.

I did.





# ""Adrift in the Dark"":

My family lived in a quiet town in Wisconsin, the kind of place where the loudest sound at night was the wind through the trees. Dad was an optometrist—steady hands, calm voice, always fixing people’s vision, helping them see the world a little clearer. Mom stayed home with us—my older brother Brian, me, and our little sister Rene. We lived simply, but Dad had dreams beyond the clinic. He used to talk about the ocean like it was another world.

That’s why, one spring day in 1961, he announced an adventure. “We’re going sailing,” he said, eyes gleaming like a kid’s. “A real voyage, out near Florida.” He’d saved for years and found a charter boat—a sleek, white yacht called *Bluebelle.* We were going to sail the Bahamas, just the five of us, plus a captain and his wife.

At the dock in Fort Lauderdale, the air smelled like salt and diesel. The sun glared off the water, blindingly bright. That’s where we met Captain Julian Harvey. He was tall and lean, with a crisp white shirt and a grin that showed too many teeth. His wife, Mary Dene, was the opposite—soft-spoken, with cropped brown hair and watchful eyes that missed nothing. She smiled politely, but something about her seemed… anxious, like she was forcing it.

Dad shook Julian’s hand, firm and confident, while Mom gathered us close. “This’ll be wonderful,” Dad said, the way he always did when he wanted us to believe something. Brian, fourteen and too cool for everything, smirked and said, “Yeah, as long as we catch some fish.” Rene, just seven, was bouncing, talking about dolphins and mermaids, her braids flying. I told her mermaids weren’t real. I wish I’d been right that the sea only held stories.

We set sail that afternoon, the boat cutting a clean path through the turquoise water. The first few days were magic—sky so blue it hurt your eyes, white sand islands like dreams. Julian steered with easy confidence, telling war stories about flying planes in the service, near misses, lucky breaks. Mary Dene cooked simple meals in the tiny galley—fresh fish, fruit, sandwiches. She rarely looked Julian in the eye.

Sometimes, when she thought no one was watching, I’d see her staring out at the horizon, her lips moving like she was whispering to herself.

One evening, while we lounged on deck, Julian said to Dad, “Arthur, you’ve got a fine family. Makes a man think about what really matters.”

Dad laughed, unaware of how Julian’s eyes lingered on us. “With a boat like this, who needs to settle?”

I remember that moment—the sky burning orange, waves whispering against the hull. Everything felt peaceful. But peace doesn’t last long on the ocean.

By the fifth night, the air felt different—heavy, close. Julian had grown quieter, brooding. Mary Dene seemed nervous, her hands trembling as she passed dishes at dinner. Later that night, when everyone was below deck, I went up to watch the stars and heard voices—sharp, angry voices—from the cabin below.

“You promised this would work,” Mary Dene hissed.  
“Keep your voice down,” Julian snapped. “It’s under control.”

I froze, listening, heart hammering. I didn’t know what they meant, but their words carried something dark. When I told Brian later, he shrugged it off. “Adults fight,” he said. “Don’t worry about it.”

But I couldn’t stop worrying. Something in Julian’s eyes had changed.

Our last night—November 12. The ocean was calm, the moon silver and full. Dinner was quiet, the kind of quiet that hums in your bones. Julian grilled the fish he’d caught earlier. Dad made a toast with water glasses. “To the best week of our lives,” he said. Mom smiled, tired but happy. Rene was half asleep by the time dessert came, her head on Mom’s shoulder.

After she went to bed, Brian and I stayed up playing cards with Julian. He taught us poker but said betting ruined the fun. “Luck,” he said, dealing the cards, “runs out when you least expect.” He looked at me a moment too long, his smile too tight. My stomach twisted.

Later, I went to bed, Brian snoring softly above me. The boat creaked with every wave, rhythmic and comforting. I must’ve drifted off because the next thing I remember is a sound that didn’t belong.

A scream.

High, sharp, and real.

I shot upright, heart pounding. Brian stirred. “What was that?”

Then—thuds. A crash. A man’s voice shouting. I knew that voice. Julian.

“Put that down!” Dad’s voice, desperate.

We crept toward the main cabin, the hallway dimly lit by a single bulb. My hands were shaking so hard I could barely move. I peeked around the corner—and everything shattered.

Julian stood there, face twisted, a rifle in his hands. Mary Dene was on the floor, blood pooling beneath her. Dad stood between Julian and Mom, his arms spread wide. “Think about the children,” he said. His voice cracked.

Julian’s eyes were empty, like something inside him had already gone. “This wasn’t the plan,” he muttered. “You all saw too much.”

The gun went off.

The sound split the air, echoing against the walls. Dad fell, and Mom screamed, running to him. Another shot. She dropped beside him.

Brian gasped, and I clamped my hand over his mouth. My heart was a drumbeat in my skull.

Julian paced, muttering. Then he turned toward Rene’s cabin.

I wanted to scream, to run, but my legs wouldn’t move.

Her small voice carried down the hall. “Captain? What’s happening?”

I heard her cry once—then silence.

Brian grabbed my arm. “Hide. Now.” He pushed me toward a storage locker near the engine room. I crawled inside, heart hammering so hard I thought he’d hear it. Through a thin crack, I saw him drag Brian out. “Where’s the girl?” he growled.

Brian fought him. “You’ll never find her!”

Julian struck him with the rifle. The sound was wet, final. Then—nothing.

I stayed there for what felt like forever. Then came the sound of wood splintering, metal breaking. The boat tilted. Water started creeping under the door. My breath came in gasps. He was sinking the ship.

When the cold water reached my knees, I couldn’t stay hidden any longer. I pushed out, the hallway nearly underwater. My family floated there, their faces pale under the emergency light. I forced myself not to look. I climbed to the deck.

Julian was gone. The dinghy was gone. The *Bluebelle* was dying.

I found a small cork float tied near the stern, barely big enough for one person. I cut it loose and slipped into the dark water as the yacht groaned and went under, dragging everything I loved with it.

The sea was endless. The stars blurred. I drifted, numb, too shocked to cry. By dawn, my skin burned and my throat ached for water. Time fell apart. I talked to the air. I saw ships that weren’t there. I heard Rene’s voice, calling my name.

Three days later—maybe four—a gray shape rose on the horizon. A freighter. Real this time.

When they pulled me aboard, I tried to speak, but no words came. Only sobs.

Later, in the hospital, police told me the rest. Julian had been found first, floating in a dinghy with Rene’s body. He said a storm had sunk the *Bluebelle*. When he heard I’d survived, he locked himself in a hotel bathroom and cut his wrists.

The truth came out piece by piece—insurance fraud, murder, a plan gone wrong.

I grew up with a new name—Tere. I learned to smile again, but some nights, when the wind rattles the windows, I wake up tasting saltwater, hearing that scream.

I survived, but part of me never left that boat.

If you ever find yourself far from shore, remember this: sometimes, the most dangerous thing on the water isn’t the sea. It’s the man steering the ship.





# ""The Caretaker"":

We’d been drifting apart for a while — not fighting, just exhausted. I worked long hours typing up medical reports from home, and David taught online business classes from our tiny Chicago apartment. We kept telling ourselves things would get easier once work slowed down, once we had time to breathe, once we could remember how to just *be* together again.

One night, after another day that ended in silence, I sat on the couch scrolling through vacation rentals we couldn’t afford. That’s when I found it — a cozy lakefront cottage in northern Michigan. The photos looked dated, like they’d been taken decades ago — wood-paneled walls, orange drapes, an old dock stretching into still water. It was available last-minute, and the price was absurdly low. The listing promised *“privacy, peace, and quiet — a true escape.”* I told myself it was a hidden gem.

I booked it that night. Wired the payment directly, as the host requested. “Let’s just go,” I told David. “No work, no Wi-Fi, no phones.” He smiled for the first time in weeks. “Let’s do it. We need this.”

The directions came the next morning by email — not an address, but a scanned map with handwritten notes: *“Turn left at the dead oak,”* and *“watch for the red mailbox.”* It felt rustic, old-fashioned. Quaint, I told myself. But as the highway gave way to backroads and the trees thickened, I started to feel uneasy. The pavement turned to gravel, then dirt. My phone lost signal. The forest swallowed the sound of our tires.

When we finally reached the cabin, it was exactly like the photos — maybe *too* much like them. A small two-bedroom with faded siding, perched right on the water. A rowboat floated lazily at the dock, and a padlocked shed leaned against the trees out back. Inside, it felt like a time capsule from 1983 — shag carpet, avocado appliances, a faint smell of mildew and old pine. There was no TV, no signal, and the silence was thick.

But David loved it. He grilled burgers while I unpacked. “This is perfect,” he said, handing me a glass of wine as the sky blushed orange over the lake. “No distractions. Just us.”

That first evening was almost magical. We sat on the dock, toes skimming the water, talking like we used to. Then I noticed a faint flicker across the lake — a single light between the trees, steady, unmoving. “Someone else out here?” I asked. David shrugged. “Probably another cabin.” But the way that light stayed still, like it was fixed directly on us, made me shiver.

The next morning was beautiful. Mist hovered over the lake, and the world felt brand new. We took the rowboat out, watched turtles on sunken logs, and let the quiet settle in. For a few hours, I forgot the city, the stress, everything.

Then, just before lunch, David called me out to the porch. “Look,” he whispered, handing me the binoculars we’d found in a drawer. Across the lake, half-hidden in the trees, a figure stood watching us. A man — motionless, holding his own pair of binoculars aimed straight at the cabin. My stomach dropped. “He’s staring right at us.”

David tried to laugh it off. “Probably a birder. Don’t make it weird.” But even after he disappeared into the trees, I couldn’t shake it — that feeling of being *seen.*

Later, we drove into town for groceries and gas. The general store was small, run by a woman in her sixties who looked surprised when we mentioned where we were staying. “You mean the old Carlson place?” she asked. When I nodded, her smile faded. “Didn’t think anyone rented that out anymore.”

David frowned. “Why’s that?”

She hesitated, glancing at another customer. “Oh, just stories. People saying they heard things. Thought someone was watching. But that was years ago.” Then she busied herself behind the counter, ending the conversation.

Back in the car, I searched the rental site. The listing was gone. Completely erased.

When we got back that afternoon, the air felt different — heavier. I noticed the padlock on the shed was hanging open. David checked inside: fishing gear, tools, and a faint smell of damp earth. “Nothing weird,” he said, locking it again. Still, my pulse wouldn’t settle.

That night, after dinner, we were playing cards when a light passed slowly across the front window. Not headlights — a flashlight. It lingered, sweeping over the walls, the kitchen, the hall. Then it was gone.

We froze.

David turned off the lamp. “Probably a hunter,” he whispered, but his eyes said otherwise. A moment later, the beam returned — circling the cabin this time, pausing at every window.

“Someone’s out there,” I whispered.

David grabbed his flashlight and stepped outside before I could stop him. I watched from the window as his beam cut through the dark. He moved cautiously around the porch, scanning the woods. When he came back, his face was pale. “No one out there,” he said. “But there are footprints. Fresh ones. Right up to the door.”

We pushed a chair under the knob and stayed awake most of the night. Every creak made my heart jump. Around 2 a.m., I heard it — a slow, deliberate scratching at the window. Nails on glass. David whispered, “Stay still.” The sound stopped… then started again, lower this time, like it had moved to the wall beneath us.

By morning, we’d made up our minds. We were leaving.

While David loaded the car, I went to double-check the shed — and froze. The padlock was open again. Inside, behind a row of paint cans, I found a wooden box. Inside were printouts — dozens of fake rental listings, each for this same cabin, but under different names. Attached were lists of couples who’d booked, ours included. Beneath the papers were Polaroids — grainy, intimate photos. People at the table. On the dock. In the bedroom. One photo showed a woman undressing by the window, unaware she was being watched.

I dropped the box. “David!”

When he saw the photos, his face drained of color. “We’re leaving now.”

We barely had time to grab our things before a knock came at the door. Slow. Heavy.

David looked through the peephole. “It’s an old man,” he whispered.

Then came the voice — raspy, almost cheerful. “Hello in there. Enjoying your stay?”

David opened the door a crack, chain on. The man stood there — gray beard, stained jacket, hands trembling slightly. “Who are you?” David asked.

The man smiled, wide and off-kilter. “I’m the caretaker. I keep this place safe. Make sure my guests are comfortable.” He slipped something through the gap — a handful of Polaroids. They scattered on the floor.

They were of *us.* Eating dinner. Sitting on the dock. Sleeping.

David slammed the door, but the man didn’t move. “Don’t worry,” he called softly through the wood. “I never hurt anyone. Just like to *see* people. Be near them.” He laughed then — a dry, brittle sound. “You two are my favorite. So sweet together.”

We ran. Grabbed our bags, sprinted to the car. As David started the engine, the man appeared by my window, pressing his face against the glass. “Don’t go yet,” he whispered. “You haven’t seen what’s underneath.”

We sped off, gravel spraying behind us.

When we reached town, we called the police. They raided the property two days later.

His name was Vernon Carlson — the son of the original owners. A retired engineer who’d lost everything after his wife died. He’d been living across the lake, setting up fake rental listings, watching the couples who came. The shed, they said, led to tunnels beneath the cabin — crawlspaces with holes drilled through the floorboards, even a narrow opening beneath the bedroom. They found cameras, notebooks, and hundreds of Polaroids spanning years.

He told police he never touched anyone. Just “kept watch.”

The real owners hadn’t known. They’d moved to Florida years earlier. The cabin was torn down soon after.

David and I came home shaken but safe. We don’t talk about it much, though sometimes, in bed, I’ll hear a faint scrape against the wall and freeze, listening.

That trip was supposed to bring us closer.  
It did — but now, every time I see a cabin by a lake, I wonder who’s watching through the walls.





# ""The Day We Ran"":

That particular afternoon, I heard Carlos leave through the front door — but this time, the inner latch didn’t click. For years, that sound had marked the boundary between us and the world outside, sealing us in like ghosts behind walls no one would ever see through. But today… silence. My daughter, little Josie, was sitting cross-legged in the corner, humming softly as she turned torn pages from an old magazine into tiny paper boats. The other girls — Kara and Lena — were locked in their rooms upstairs, as they always were, each chain a cruel signature of our invisible prison.

I stared at the door, heart pounding. It was unlocked.

A single thought broke through the fog of fear: *this could be it.* But just as quickly came the other: *what if it’s another test?* Carlos had done that before — left something open, waited, watched. I pressed my palm against the handle, feeling the cold metal tremble beneath my shaking fingers. The weight of years pressed down — and still, I turned it.

The knob moved freely.

That tiny click of the latch releasing felt louder than thunder.

My mind flashed back to how it all began — years ago, when I was just twenty-two and working late shifts at a greasy fast-food joint on the edge of town. It was the night before my birthday. I remember the way the air smelled of rain and fry oil, and how the streetlights flickered as I started my walk home. A van slowed beside me. The driver leaned out — middle-aged, soft-spoken, a face I thought I’d seen around the neighborhood.

“Hey, it’s late,” he said, smiling. “Hop in. I’ll give you a lift.”

That smile was the last bit of normalcy I’d know for a long time.

I got in. He said he needed to stop by his house “real quick,” and I didn’t think much of it. But when we stepped inside, the air shifted. The door slammed. His hand closed around my arm, and the look in his eyes turned cold. “You’re staying here now,” he said, pushing me toward a basement that smelled of mildew and earth. I screamed, but the walls swallowed the sound. The ropes bit into my wrists, and with that, my life as I knew it ended.

That basement became my universe — a place where time stopped. The air was damp, the floor cold, and the single bulb overhead buzzed like a dying insect. Soon after, he brought down Kara, who had been there even longer. Her voice was barely a whisper when she said, “Don’t make him mad. He hits hard.” A few months later, Lena came — still a teenager, trembling so violently she could hardly speak.

Carlos kept us like animals. We were moved upstairs eventually, one by one, to small boarded-up rooms. The doors locked from the outside. Chains bolted to the bed frames. Meals — if you could call them that — came once a day: a can of soup, sometimes a slice of bread. The plastic buckets in the corners served as toilets. He’d empty them when he felt like it.

Sometimes he’d talk to us like we were family. Other times, he’d snap and turn violent — his cruelty as methodical as it was unpredictable. “You’re mine,” he’d whisper after hurting us. “If you run, I’ll kill you — and I’ll make the others watch.”

Kara once told me through the wall, her voice hoarse from crying, “He made me lose babies. Starved me till they were gone.” I pressed my forehead to the cold plaster. “We’ll survive,” I whispered back. “Somehow.”

Then came Josie.

When I realized I was pregnant, I thought it would be my death sentence. But Carlos treated it like a prize. He brought extra food, even smiled once or twice. When the time came, Kara helped me deliver her in that filthy room. I still remember the pain, the smell of rust and fear, Kara’s trembling hands wiping sweat from my face. “Breathe,” she kept saying. “Push when I say.” Then a cry — Josie’s cry — sharp, alive, echoing in the small room. For the first time in years, something pure broke through the darkness.

“If she dies,” Carlos warned, “you die too.”

He paraded Josie as his “granddaughter,” taking her out to the front yard sometimes, letting the neighbors wave. “Say hi to Grandma,” he’d tell her, and she’d smile, waving her tiny hand. No one ever suspected a thing. He even went to the vigils for the missing girls — *our* vigils — standing there with a candle like some concerned citizen.

He was clever. Too clever.

Every creak of the house made my stomach twist. Every time his car pulled up, I braced myself for the sound of keys, of footsteps, of the lock clicking open. Kara tried to escape once — he caught her at the stairs. The beating lasted hours. After that, he locked her in the dark for three days. “Next time,” he said, “I’ll bury you in the woods.”

Years bled together like that — days without sunlight, nights without dreams. Hope became a dangerous thing.

But that afternoon, when I realized he’d left without locking the door, something broke loose inside me.

Josie was dozing on the mattress. I crept out into the hall. The air felt foreign — still, but full of possibility. I hurried to Kara’s room, heart hammering so hard it hurt. “Kara,” I whispered. “He’s gone. The door’s open.”

She stared at me, disbelief flickering in her hollow eyes. “Are you sure? It could be a trap.”

“I’m sure.”

She hesitated, then slipped her ankle free from the chain. The metal clinked softly — the sound of defiance. Together, we crept to Lena’s room. “Lena,” I hissed. “Now. We have to go.”

Her eyes widened. She grabbed my arm, shaking. “He’ll kill us.”

“Not if we’re gone.”

The three of us — and Josie clutched in my arms — moved through the living room like ghosts afraid to breathe. The front door loomed ahead, sunlight leaking through the cracks. But the storm door beyond it was locked.

I pressed my face to the mesh screen — and saw people outside.

For the first time in years, I saw *people.*

“Help!” I screamed, pounding the glass. “Please, help us!”

A man on the sidewalk stopped, frozen. “What’s going on?”

“Break the door!” I begged. “We’re trapped!”

He hesitated — then kicked. Wood splintered. I shoved Josie through the gap first, then climbed out myself, scraping my arms raw. The air outside hit me like water to a drowning woman.

The man grabbed my hand. “Run,” he said. “I’ll call the police.”

I ran barefoot down the street, Josie clinging to my neck, tears burning my face. I pounded on a stranger’s door, gasping, “Please — I need a phone. We’ve been kidnapped.”

The woman who answered didn’t even speak at first — just pulled me inside and called emergency services. When the sirens came, it felt unreal — like a sound from another lifetime. Police swarmed the house, rescuing Kara and Lena, who were too terrified to move until officers dragged them out.

They caught Carlos that evening, hiding in a shed not far away.

The evidence inside that house told everything — the chains, the bloodstains, the makeshift locks, the diaries we’d kept on scraps of paper hidden in the floorboards. The world finally saw what had been happening behind those walls.

Freedom came, but it wasn’t simple. Healing isn’t something that happens when the door opens — it takes years. Kara, Lena, and I sat through endless interviews, therapy sessions, court hearings. We learned how to walk outside again without flinching.

But the memories still live somewhere deep — the echo of keys, the click of locks, the smell of that damp basement.

Every time I hear a door close, I remember.

And every time I hear one open… I remember, too — that one day, one mistake, that single forgotten latch that set us free.",1,1760751048.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Now im far from a pick me, as a matter of fact I despise pick me women so much but by making those sexist comments on men you do realize you are setting us women back in time as well, right? I'd much rather deal with men that are open with their emotions, empathetic and understanding even they may seem ""fruity"" or feminine according to some sexists than men who use masculinity as an excuse to dominating, misogynistic or asshole like andrew tate types, Idk many women are attracted to that but I'm not which makes me weird I guess. 

There was an innocent video clip of men being goofy in club and having fun with other men without them even bothering the women, the comments were full of judgemental sexist women like what happened to men, men are such princesses nowadays, things were so much better back then like the same time when women had little to no rights, everytime they see a man shed a single tear they would have a meltdown over that, like I felt like I've walked into the 1900s by reading some of those comments. Like alot of these women judging men for not being as traditionally masculine are not even traditionally feminine themselves, like they are living the most modern anti feminine boss babe lifestyle out there while they are expecting men to be traditional like the good old days which seems a bit hypocritical.

 Like when they say stuff like that it means they want to set all of us women back in time as well when we had no rights and when we were dominated by men, I don't know why some women want that so badly. Like just because yall want to live in the outdated sexist gender roles it does not mean all women want to. 

Nowadays, if a guy is even slightly on the nicer side, just not the dominating asshole side which people often mistaken it as ""masculine"", he gets called fruity or he is in a lavendar marriage so yall want him to be dominating, assholish or abusive to be truly seen as ""masculine""?  Got it. Idk just sexist women seem to annoy me more for some reason especially the hypocritical one. I swear we are just going back in time.",7,1760750923.0,TwoXChromosomes,6,0.64,False

But it’s the ‘80s glow-up that’s turned it into legend: think flickering pink-and-blue signs buzzing “EAT” and “OPEN 24/7,” jukebox croonin’ Madonna and Springsteen, and enough hairspray in the air to hold up the Berlin Wall.

Hey friends! 🌟 Have you ever daydreamed about tossing your alarm clock out the window and not being chained to a desk from 9 to 5? Well, if you’re like me, the thought of waking up without the Monday dread is both enticing and thrilling! 

Now, let me spill the tea: beginner creators are cashing in on AI faster than you can say ""freedom""! 🤯 It’s like the universe decided we deserve a break from traditional work, and AI is handing us the tools to make it happen. 

So how exactly are these genius creators doing it? Here’s the inside scoop:

1. **Automating the Mundane**: You know the boring stuff that eats up your creative time? Gone! AI tools can handle everything from content writing to social media scheduling. Think of it as having a digital assistant that never takes a coffee break! 🚀

2. **Turning Ideas into Content**: If you’ve got a wild idea but lack the skills to translate it into content, AI’s got your back. With platforms like **ChatGPT and transformative tools like [Easy Peasy AI](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca)**, you don’t have to be a seasoned pro to whip up amazing articles, pitch decks, or even song lyrics! (Just watch out for songs about cats. They might get a bit too many listens. 😂)

3. **Monetizing Your Passion**: Whether you're into crafting, blogging, or digital art, let AI help you streamline your process. Beginner creators are launching e-books, online courses, and membership sites faster than ever. If there's a niche you're passionate about, why not take the plunge? 

4. **Building Communities**: The best part about being a creator today? You don’t have to go it alone. Engage with your audience, get feedback, and grow together. AI can help analyze what your people want, so you can give them what they crave! 🍕 (Who doesn’t love pizza?)

5. **Flexibility = Freedom**: Imagine working from a cozy café or your favorite park instead of being stuck in a cubicle. With AI doing the heavy lifting, you can spend more time doing what you love—traveling, hiking, or just binge-watching your favorite shows without guilt.

Okay, but let’s keep it real for a second. It won’t be perfect overnight, and you might have to experiment a little. Learn what works best for you, and don't hesitate to use the amazing tools available! 

I mean, why stick with the 9-to-5 grind when there are endless possibilities at your fingertips? It's like having a superpower, but instead of flying or invisibility, you get creative freedom and financial independence. 🙌

So, what’s stopping you? Ready to take that leap? Share your thoughts or tips if you're already on this AI creator journey. Who knows? You might just inspire someone else to grab that freedom too!

But it all went down the drain. We fought about the smallest of things. That night, we fought about the coffee maker.

The coffee maker wasn't defective, or so I thought it wasn't. When I used it, it worked fine. But it didn't for you, you didn't like how it brewed your coffee. You snapped.

We fought over coffee, we shouted, we hurt each other. But that wasn't supposed to happen, we were happy in the morning. 

We drove around, we ate breakfast, we laughed with my sister. We slept good together, I woke up smiling at you while you were in front of that coffee maker.

My face is swollen, my ears are bleeding, my heart aches. I'm scared, I feel alone, I feel so little, I feel so heartbroken. My mind is saying ""you overreacted"", ""you shouldn't have done that"", ""you ruined everything"" 

But you didn't have to be angry. You didn't have to shout. You didn't have to hit me. You can choose how to react on the smallest of inconveniences. Are you in pain? Why are you so angry? Where is all these coming from?

One morning we were smiling, the next I'm crying alone in this house I can't call home. I wish I was there with you, I wish we are happy again, I wish you never hurt me. I wish my face doesn't hurt. I wish my heart doesn't ache like this.

I can't sleep, I can't stop crying, I want to go back to you. I want to hug you. Are you scared? Are you lonely? Are you crying too?

**Arctic Research Station E-9**

*March* 20th

For the first time in nearly a week, the air is still. The wind has given up its constant scream, and what remains is something worse, silence. It’s the kind of quiet that hums in your ears until you begin to wonder if you’re hearing your own blood.

The snow from the night before settled like spilled flour across the tundra. Everything looks weightless, untouched, too perfect to disturb. When the sun rose, it did so in a thin, pale line, more suggestion than light. Dr. Everwood said it’s the last of winter’s breath. I can believe that. Even the air feels brittle, ready to shatter if you speak too loudly.

The herd remains in the basin below. They’ve hardly moved since yesterday. Carter’s been making her usual rounds with the rangefinder, checking the radio collars, logging the herd’s trajectory. Or, more accurately, their lack of one. The elk should have started north by now, heading toward the lower mountain corridors as spring edges in, but they’re still here, listless, confused, motionless.

When I looked through the binoculars this morning, I noticed something troubling. None of them are grazing still. There are exposed patches of ground now, tufts of tundra grass and moss breaking through the crust, but they don’t touch it. Their ribs are showing. Even the calves keep their heads low as though afraid to lift them.

Carter thinks it’s exhaustion from the storm. Dr. Everwood, ever the optimist of morbidity, says it’s a *“stress response indicative of systemic behavioral alteration.”* I think it’s hunger. Starvation does strange things to animals, and to people.

Still, there’s something else about them. They move in circles. Always counterclockwise. Not random, deliberate. I’ve seen herds do many things, but not this.

By midday, we went out to set new thermal cameras along the ridge-line. The wind had started to pick up again, fine ribbons of snow chasing our boots like ghosts. The tracks from the wolf pack are half-buried now. No sign of the predators themselves.

When we reached the upper ridge, I could see the entire valley stretched below, white and endless. The herd looked like scattered seeds against the snow. In the center, barely keeping up, was the injured elk, the same one that escaped the wolves.

It limped along, dragging one rear leg, its fur mottled dark around the wound.

Carter noted that the others didn’t shy away from it as expected. In fact, a few brushed close to its side, as though shepherding it.

*“They’re protecting it,”* she said.

Everwood didn’t look up from his notes. *“Or observing it.”*

I asked what he meant, but he didn’t answer.

We finished setting up the new cameras before the light faded. The ridge feels different now, heavier somehow, like standing on a ledge above a sleeping thing you can’t see but know is there. I kept glancing toward the northern rise, the one that overlooks the valley’s far end. For a second, I thought I saw movement, a faint shimmer of white among the snow dunes. Probably my eyes playing tricks again.

Still, when I turned to head back, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something *stayed* on that ridge long after we left.

The storm clouds have cleared completely. The sky tonight is a cathedral of green, the aurora rippling in slow, haunting waves across the black. It reflects in the snow so that everything, even our camp, glows faintly. Beautiful, in a way that feels cruel.

We set up in the mobile lab for the evening data review. Carter brewed coffee strong enough to strip paint; she’s the only one who can drink it black without flinching. Everwood’s in good spirits, *“anomalous behavior always leads to good papers,”* he said earlier, smiling that way of his that makes me uneasy.

At first, the footage is uneventful. The herd gathered near the lower basin, clustered close together for warmth. Then, one of the cameras flickers, static, then black for a few seconds. The cold’s been hell on the circuits, so none of us react right away.

Then it stabilizes.

The wounded elk has returned to frame. It limps forward, slow, mechanical, until it collapses onto its front knees. Its breath plumes white, rising in bursts that fade into the darkness. The rest of the herd gathers around it, first one, then a dozen.

They don’t move away.

At first, it looks like they’re nuzzling it, brushing snow from its hide. Then Carter frowns and says quietly, *“Wait… are they licking it?”*

I zoom in.

The image clarifies, tongues and muzzles pressed against the wound, slick with blood. Another elk joins, then another. One lowers its head and bites.

The sound cuts through the wind. Even through the camera’s microphone, I can hear the soft, wet tearing.

Carter gasps. “Jesus Christ, they’re-”

Dr. Everwood interrupts her, his voice barely a whisper: *“Feeding.”*

No one speaks for a long time after that. The only sound is the hum of the laptop fan.

I don’t know what disturbs me more, the act itself or how calm the herd seems. No thrashing, no panic. It’s deliberate. Coordinated. Almost ritualistic.

I turned away feeling nauseous. I didn’t want to see more.

And that night, I woke sometime around two in the morning. I’m not sure what stirred me, maybe the silence again, or maybe the sense that the walls themselves were listening. The heater rattled quietly in the corner. The air felt thin, sharp in my lungs.

Carter and Everwood were asleep in their bunks. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, tried to convince myself that the images from earlier were just exhaustion-induced illusions.

I decided to get a drink.

The metal floor bit at my feet as I stepped into the main compartment of the mobile lab. The air in there always smells faintly of ozone and coffee. The laptops were still running, the screens dimmed but glowing faintly, little windows of flickering light in the dark.

That’s when I felt it again.

That *pull*. Like gravity bending wrong.

I turned toward the monitors. Most feeds showed the usual, patches of snow, the herd sleeping in dense clusters, faint heat signatures flickering like dying stars.

Except for one.

One screen was completely black.

At first, I assumed frost buildup on the lens. It happens sometimes. I leaned closer, squinting. The darkness seemed too solid, though, not a blur, but a surface.

Then something shifted.

It wasn’t motion, exactly. More like depth. As if the black wasn’t flat but hollow, curving inward. I blinked, rubbed my eyes. For a moment, it almost looked like-

A pupil.

A cold weight dropped in my stomach. I realized what I was looking at. The ridge camera, the one facing north. The same direction I’d seen movement earlier today.

The darkness blinked. Once. Slow.

My pulse hammered in my ears. I stared closer, unable to move. Around the edges of the frame, faint white shimmered, fur catching the residual aurora light. The lens had caught the outline of a face.

The polar bear.

But it wasn’t like before. Its fur wasn’t pure white. Patches of it were stained, streaks of brownish red crusted around its muzzle, its chest. Blood, maybe. The bear’s head tilted, and for a brief, horrifying moment, the shape of its mouth caught the light.

It looked like a grin.

No. It wasn’t smiling. I know that now. It was just *watching*.

Unmoving. Unblinking.

It filled the entire frame, as if it had walked right up to the camera and decided to look straight through it. Straight through *me*.

I can’t explain it, but I felt certain it knew I was there. As though, across miles of ice and dark, we had locked eyes through the cold glass. My hand trembled on the keyboard, my breath fogging the screen.

Every instinct screamed to wake the others. But I couldn’t. My body refused.

The bear didn’t move for over a minute. Maybe more. Just stood there, the wind blowing faint streaks of frost across the lens.

And the longer I looked, the more wrong it seemed. Its eyes, too black, too deep. Polar bears have dark eyes, yes, but these weren’t natural. They looked *empty.*

And behind them, I swore I saw movement, faint rippling shapes, as if something alive twisted behind the sockets.

*I can’t shake the feeling we are not the only ones watching the herd.*

I don’t even remember writing that line. It just appeared in the margin of the page when I looked down.

Eventually, I slammed the laptop shut. The sound echoed too loudly in the small space. My heart felt like it might break through my ribs.

I stood there, staring at the blank metal wall, trying to breathe. The hum of the heater was the only sound, steady, patient, almost human in its rhythm. My reflection in the window was just a shadow among shadows.

Somewhere out beyond this thin shell of steel and light, something was awake. Watching. Waiting.

The thought came unbidden, crawling out from the corner of my mind like a whisper I couldn’t unhear:

I had my first hemorrhoidectomy around this time last year, and that was basically a botched job (my doc underplayed how serious this prep + recovery is). Anyways, I had another surgery a week ago, and I wanted to share my advice because the first week is typically the worst. I had an external hemorrhoid attached to a skin tag, and I got this done primarily due to cosmetic and hygiene reasons. I'm 22f. 

Prep: 

Miralax and stool softener the day before and make sure to be hydrated for the surgery. Morning of the surgery, do an enema. Do not skip this step (I didn't do this for my first surgery but it makes a huge difference for your first bm. Its like night and day compared to my last surgery.) Bring a painkiller and take that immediately after u wake up from your surgery. I was numb for maybe the first 2 hours after surgery and then it wore off and I felt everything. 

I think my pain tolerance is pretty high (esp because I've done this surgery before). I was prescribed percocets but only took tylenol throughout this entire recovery because I really wanted to avoid constipation. Every morning, take your pain meds, miralax, stool softener and vitamins. Gulp it down with electrolytes and then more water (aim for at least 1.5L in the beginning)

Day 1 (Surgery day oct 9)

When you get home, take all your medications and nutrient supplements. I did another dose of miralax, electrolytes, multivitamin gummies, vitamin C, pain medication and stool softener. Had my first bm a couple hours later which wasnt too bad but my wound just felt incredibly raw. Popped in a tylenol before bed. Be prepared to rest badly for a lot of hours and your leg to go numb from laying on it for too long. Pain probably was an 8/10. 

Day 2:

Probably the worse day pain wise; started at an 8.5/10 and then bumped down to a 4.5. No one tells how gassy and bloated you feel, I genuinely looked pregnant. BM in the morning and probably showered 3 times this day bc of the pain. I didn't eat any meat this past week and my bm have been consistent and frequent. Food digestion is really easy when its just fruit and vegetables, so highly recommend cutting out meat and dairy for a little bit during recovery. 

Day 3: 

Do not sleep on your back - I did this and woke up to really bad back pain and an insane amount of pressure on my wound/gut. Had 2 bm in the morning and showered. I did not do any sitz baths throughout this, just because it felt really gross to me. I can imagine it helping though if you're constipated or really struggling to have a bm. Finally took a look at my wound and not bad!! But I think it is normal to have small lumps and bumps there because of the swelling. Don't be too worried and really try not to strain during bm. 

Day 4: 

Had my morning bms and shower, which is good that my body has a schedule. Non woven gauze or panty liners are so much better than the woven gauze which just irritated me. I ate a lot for thanksgiving and it was really carb heavy. Did not eat meat though and I was worried for my bm the next day. Still taking a tylenol after each bm, and sleep was starting to get more comfortable. 

Day 5: 

Pain graduated to a 3/10. Morning bm, and I can also sit for longer periods of time without too much discomfort. I took a small, slow walk which was great for my mental health. I cut back on tylenol frequency, and have incorproated larger food portions and solid foods which has not affected my bm (yay). If you're constipated, try to do a bit of gentle walking to get your gut moving. I think a big reason why I wasn't constipated was because of diet, laxatives and also not taking stronger meds. 

Day 6: 

The usual morning routine, but today I started getting discharge and leaking. I also got my period :/ I was really tired this day so I was resting in bed alot. For all the women out there, try to plan this surgery before or after ur cycle. It wasnt bad for me, but it just was something extra I had to worry about. Nobody prepares you for how bad your wound starts to smell. 

Day 7: 

Pain was only felt after my morning bm, and that resided after 10-20 minutes ish. I started to add more dairy and protein to my diet to see if I can reguarly eat this. I'm not taking any more tylenols so thats a good sign.

Day 8: 

Went back to work and ran a bunch of my errands in the morning. I started bleeding after both my bm's, which was probably from my diet im guessing. I'm back to fruits, vegetables and soups. No breads, eggs, milks, coffees etc. The discharge, blood, and actual wound gives me such bad body odour, I am so self consious to be around people or use public toilets rn. Work wasn't too bad and I do quite a bit of walking at work. 

Day 9: 

I would say I feel like I'm 60-70% recovered? Obviously it's still early but the pain is gone and I just have to be careful around my bm now. If I recall correctly, my wound from last year stopped leaking discharge around 6 weeks out, so I'm hoping I have that same or even earlier timeline. I'm also done my period, and am just walking about with gauze in between my cheeks now. I'm sleeping with polysporin on the wound and mainly trying to prevent the area from scarring / developing skin tags. I still have my stitches intact. 

I'll probs keep this updated if I remember to log everything. Biggest tips though: 

1. have a strict schedule for all your medications / supplements / laxatives. I think it really helps your body regulate your bms. Stick to that schedule like your life depends on it.

2. Electrolytes and water. You really have to stay hydrated throughout this entire process. Also non woven gauze trumps everything else. 

3. If its painful for you at night, make sure to wear a retainer or something to prevent your teeth from grinding! 

4. Get ahead of the pain and take your meds after surgery or a couple hours before your anesthesia wears off.

5. cut out sugar and meats; stick to fruits and veggies mainly. I was basically a salty vegan this past week and didn't have any issues with constipation. 

6. It might seem bad now, but it won't be painful forever. Last year, I did a half-marathon 5 weeks after the surgery. The body is incredibly resilient. Good luck everyone! 

If anyone can answer these questions for me: 

\- At what point of the recovery do you think it's safe to reintroduce alcohol into my body?

\- Did anyone travel for long periods within a month of their surgery? How was recovery during vacation or long flights? 

\- For those who have completely healed, are you happy with the result cosmetically? Did it heal flat, with skin tags, etc? I'd love to know. ",2,1760749559.0,hemorrhoid,2,1.0,False

The space they have is 80m2 (give or take). The kicker is i accidently acquired 2 roosters, I removed 1 after our neighbours complained to me about the crowing at all hours and then ultimately had to remove the other when he also bugged them with noise. The 2nd rooster was rehomed on the 7th october, on the 16th Oct I received a letter (dated 9th oct) from the shire outlining their poultry policy (roosters are not allowed where I am) so a neighbour has reported it

Basically my current chicken set up does not meet shire standards even though those hens are living the dream. The same neighbours who complained about the roosters said they loved our chicken's area and loved to see them free ranging while drinking their morning coffee etc. 

What's the chance that the shire is going to inspect and enforce their policy? 

If I was to build a new coop to shire standard they'd be in a much smaller area with no trees or garden to free range in - it'd have to be back by our shed with a concrete floor. 

My options are 
1. Risk the shire coming to inspect and leave my hens where they are
2. Build a new coop, which would cost me a fair chunk of money
3. Rehome my girls

Up the paved, hard, concrete-through the double sided French doors. I'm walking into a past memory; the floorboards are filled with faded footprints and the air is a dry, old, perfume...dust

Children played here while the dogs offered protection and love. 

French toast in the mornings
Burgers in the evening
Between the two, there time together was at noon. 

And while wonderful memories flood into my mind. I see our first lamp, it was a wedding gift. Now, I dont feel fine. 

It was forgotten, the bulb, Burnt out-
If that isn't symbolism, I dont know what is. 
But im not here to remember-we've been gone since there were bright lights wrapped around a tree-it sat there, right in the corner

Once again, I sit and ponder... Past holidays, the smell of turkey and gravey, this was everyone's favorite day. 

Now there should be pumpkin lining that hard concrete, warm candy corn flavored coffee. This was her favorite, but the coffee maker has been picked up. 

I walk to the garage, I witness the problem that started it all, it wasn't her issues that required me to buy more tissues but my own. Now I stare, at empty alcohol glass bottles. I hold onto hope-behind the bag of sin is a box...

Light bulbs.

Part two

Im not sure whats happening here inside my soul. The sky looks different, filled with sunshine when the temperature is fair, and an angel paints me a rainbow when I feel holy tears fall from the heavens.

I've experienced this before, but the feeling is nostalgic, its been years since I could feel the wind on my face, and now I know all the things that made life so special-freedom

I finally have my smile again, most people age with laugh lines- mine are downward pointed scars

But those scars are memories-they taught me how to run from my nightmare and now I am finally here-free and seeing clear

My mood has been elevated! For so long I sat in a room with 4 walls and no windows-even the floorboards laughed at me, stained with mud as he unevenly walked home. Never using the front door where i placed the mat-always through the side French doors. Its like he was trying to hide his late arrival-he left his second home to taste some liquid courage because he has none- the smell of whiskey makes me sick. 

But that is all gone, no new stories will be written-i opened my old book and im the author, not the ghost writer. 

This old house. Where I was born. I'm home now! My dogs have space to run and my kids can laugh, sing and hide. The laughs won't be pointed at their school paintings, the songs wont be sad prayers, and when they decide to hide-it won't be from a leather strap, with his hand holding the buckle. 

Oh, I just remembered!-i need a new light bulb for my old childhood home-the last one burnt out. 

Part 3:

In the end, the man kept the old house-empty and cold

The girl took the family-full of life, love and new memories- reminiscent of white Christmas mornings

 The lawyers are all done and the judge has declared his decision. 

They will finalize the papers in the morning.

The girls light bulb is bright..

...the boys bulb remains broken...

..no light..

but over time, I stopped treating debugging as a panic mode and started seeing it as detective work. Here’s what changed everything for me:

1. Stop guessing — start isolating
Instead of rewriting half the codebase, I now break things down line by line. Find where it breaks, not why — the “why” comes after.

2. Add intentional logs (not spam)
I used to console.log everything. Now I log strategically — inputs, outputs, and state changes. The goal is to see the story, not the noise.

3. Reproduce it reliably
If I can’t reproduce the bug twice, I can’t fix it once. Every time I find a way to trigger it consistently, I’m halfway there.

4. Walk away when stuck
Some of my best “fixes” happened after grabbing a coffee or taking a short walk. Debugging isn’t just mental—it’s patience training.

5. Use AI as your debugging buddy
Sometimes I paste the function into ChatGPT/Blackbox and say “find what’s dumb here.” It often spots logic gaps faster than my brain does after 3 hours.

now debugging feels less like chaos and more like solving a mystery — minus the crime scene.

How do you approach debugging when you’re stuck? I’d love to hear other devs’ battle-tested tricks",13,1760749148.0,aicoding,0,1.0,False

1o9iey1,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1o9iey1/first_time_posting_advice_needed/,First time posting. Advice needed.,"There is a lot here but I will do my best to sum it up. 

I have been with my husband for 8 years, we separated and were seeing other people, my husband fell in love with the person he was seeing and they were poly (before this my husband and I were monogamous) when we were separated I was also poly. 

My husband and this girl separated then my husband and I got back together. My husband still loves us both. I tried several times to accept this other women as my meta but she has been very mean to me and has made it hard. 

They have broken up, got back together, broken up, talked about getting back together and the cycle has continued and all this time she has said awful things to me then apologized, said awful things, then apologizes again (she does struggle from multiple personality disorder), my husband and I became monogamous for a few months (we are still monogamous) I reached out to the other women to see if I could help mend things between her and my husband and when I did she told me very rudely not to contact her, she is monogamous and she has nothing to talk about so I felt relieved like my husband and I dont have to deal with her anymore.

A couple weeks ago she reached out to my husband (again) and wanted to ""talk"" my husband asked me if he could talk to her saying he needed closer I said yes, they talked for an hour and a half (which I thought was way too long for closer) he said it wasn't long enough because he didn't get answers. I told him I dont want him talking to her again and he agreed. 

I found out he has been talking to her while I have been at work (he said 6 times including calls and texts) I asked her about it and she said she has been talking to him and with questioning her she said he has made sexual jokes towards her and he has been back and fourth on if he wants to be with her or not (my husband and I are currently monogamous and he is not supposed to be talking to her based on our agreement. He admitted to the jokes but says he was not going back and fourth on being with her because we are monogamous.) 

They both admit to still having feelings for each other but he says he doesn't want to be with her for different reasons and she says she is monogamous and only wants friendship from my husband and I (according to my husband she talks and flirts with other men besides her boyfriend).

My husband wants me, him, and her to meet because she wants to apologize to me (again ugh) for being mean to me and supposedly (besides my husband telling her the bad things about me during our separation) she was mean to me due to being jealous of my husband and I being together and her wanting to be number one in his life. 

At first my husband said he wanted us to meet so he can give her back her carpet cleaner now its so she can apologize to me in person because I ""deserve that"" (I think its because he still has feelings for her so they want to be more than friends behind mine and her boyfriends backs I mean come on they still have feelings for each other, and supposedly she is never friends with her exes (according to my husband), plus he was already talking to her behind my back. 

Supposedly her boyfriend knows she talks to other men even though they are monogamous, she has admitted to me if something happens between her and her boyfriend she would want to be back with my husband, her and her boyfriend are long distance (so who knows how long they will last).

My husband plays dumb and says he doesnt know why she wants to be his friend but he laughed and smiled when she basically admitted she wants to be his friend because he is on the backburner incase her and her boyfriend break up. 

I agreed to meeting her tomorrow. 

My husband and I have to drive two and a half hours to see her and buy her coffee because she is disabled and has no money because she cant work. 

My husband is also disabled and doesnt work so he had a lot of time to talk to her while I was trusting him thinking he wouldn't talk to her behind my back. 

I am currently having trust issues but my husband and I are meeting her tomorrow so she can ""apologize"" in person. 

I need advice on this if anything comes to your mind.

This is a little older and I don't think I've published it here before. Enjoy!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“What am I supposed to do?” Dove screamed on the track. Her voice, a raspy but melodic wonder, shone through the heavy guitar riffs and thumping drum beats.

“What am I supposed to do?” she repeated, softer with a more pleading tone.

The sludgy guitars and bone-rattling drums came to a sudden halt. The only thing still playing was Dove’s haunting vocals. She drew out the last line of what she hoped would be the lead single. The song had been borne from disaster, but Dove believed it was an act of God that she had even been able to write it.

Six months prior, Dove experienced a string of shitty events that rocked her life. In the span of two weeks, her lead guitarist quit the band, her boyfriend broke up with her, and she got canned from Kinkos. Depressed, she sat in her studio apartment and wondered if she was cursed. But depression, ever the muse, led her to this song. They recorded it two days later, and it had become her favorite on the demo. This was the one that would get her over the finish line.

“What am I supposed to do?”

Her voice faded to nothing, and the small office filled with deafening silence. Kevin Tyvin, the lead A&R man at Master Plan Records, sat quietly in a chair with a pensive look. Over the six months Dove and her band had been working with Kevin, she’d never been able to figure out what was going on behind his baby blues. The guy was harder to read than Aramaic.

“That’s the new one,” Dove said, “It might not be as polished as the others, but I...we felt it fit our vibe.”

“No, it’s good. Really good.”

Dove let a small smile cross her face. The two had met by chance in a coffee shop about a year ago. He came in for a cup while she was finishing up an acoustic set. He stayed and watched her end, and the two struck up a conversation. They clicked, and he came and saw her band, Absent Father, later that week.

If Kevin was a fan, this could be life-altering news.

Kevin Tyvin was a local legend in the scene. He had shepherded Master Plan’s move from a small, primarily folk-based indie label to a mid-major that had signed several bands with radio play hits. The most prominent band at the label, Water Pistol, had emerged from the cavalcade of Seattle sound-a-likes and charted with their debut. It had been a significant coup for Master Plan and made Kevin a taste-maker at the label.

If he liked you, you stood a great chance of signing. Kevin liked Absent Father. Kevin liked Dove. Kevin liked the song. It seemed destined. She had wandered in the darkness for years, and now she saw the light at the end of the tunnel. She’d be in the spotlight soon enough. The struggle had been worth it.

“That’s good, right?” Dove asked, trying to prod info out of the man.

Kevin let out a long sigh. “Trends are...shifting. While sonically great, Absent Father isn’t where the industry is going.”

“What?”

“Dove, I know this is hard to hear because of the effort you guys put into this, but rock is changing directions. More hip-hop-infused metal, ya know? The label doesn’t want to be caught promoting a new act with an older sound when fans start switching gears,” he said softly. “This isn’t a music decision. This is a business decision.”

“I...what?”

He stood up and nodded at Dove and the band, “I know this sucks right now, but you guys should find a home on a label that will support you instead of one that won’t. You guys are hungry, and I hope you find a home because this demo is great. The last song is a hit.”

“This is insane, Kevin,” Dove said, “You know it’s good, but you won’t do anything because tastes may change soon?”

“Out of my control, Dove. I’m sorry,” he said, sticking out his hand to end things on good terms.

“Fuck off,” Dove said, pushing past him and out of the office. Her bandmates followed suit, leaving Kevin alone. He put his hand down and sighed. The music industry was a fickle beast.

Dove ran to her car, her bandmates trailing and calling out for her, but she ignored them. She needed to be alone at the moment. She turned over the sputtering engine of her old Honda Accord and slammed on the gas. As fast as the decrepit four-cylinder engine could muster, Dove lurched down the street, her exhaust sending up thick black smoke.

Her Methuselah mobile coughed out a few backfires that used to remind Dove of flashbulbs popping but now sounded like gunshots. Fitting, Dove thought, a bullet to the back of the head of her career. In the rearview, she saw her bandmates chasing her for a bit before they stopped running and lit up a smoke.

We all grieve differently.

Dove didn’t go home. Sitting in the messy studio apartment that overlooked a parking structure wouldn’t help mend her soul. Instead, she drove her car a few miles from town, where the skyscrapers gave way to redwoods. The only person she wanted to see at the moment was mother nature.

Before she left for the woods, she pulled off at a liquor store and grabbed a bottle of cheap vodka. Sulking goes better with booze. If she got too drunk, she’d sleep in her car. She had done it so often on the road she kept a pillow and blanket in the trunk of her car.

Mercifully, the park was free of other people. Her beater was the only car in the lot. She grabbed her alcohol and headed out into the wilderness. As a kid, her parents used to camp out here, and Dove felt a deep spiritual connection with the forest. As an adult, she returned often to set her mind at ease.

Ease was what she needed at the moment.

She followed along the well-worn path taking swings from her bottle and mumbling songs to herself. Dove didn’t sing any of her own. They brought her too much sorrow. Instead, she mumbled songs outside her genre: Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, or Michael Jackson. Anything to keep the evil thoughts out of her head.

Dove tipped the plastic bottle back and took a long swig. It burned going down and made her stomach feel like a four-alarm fire. Realizing she had overdone it, she dropped onto all fours and spat up most of the vodka. It burned as much coming up as it did going down.

After purging, she rolled on her back and lay in the dirt. Though her head was only inches away from the sick, she closed her eyes and concentrated on the sounds of the forest. Without realizing it, she started mumble singing, “Some boys try, and some boys lie, but I don’t let them play, no way.” At that, she started to giggle, which soon gave way to belly laughs.

Eventually, those belly laughs turn into sobs. Despite trying to stave off the moment, it finally arrived. Dove let the tears come. This failure tasted different than the others she’d faced in her career. Those felt like road bumps on the way to bigger things. This one, though, left Dove feeling like she ran headlong into a brick wall.

It felt like the end of something and not the beginning.

She reached into her front pocket and pulled out her cassette demo. Along the thin plastic ribbon were all of her hopes and dreams. Her life’s work was on this tiny little hunk of oil byproduct. In the right hands, this cassette could be the thing that launched her career into orbit. Instead, it stayed inert in the launch pad of her pocket, not reaching unfathomable heights but only taking up space.

Dove wasn’t old, but she wasn’t a young woman anymore, either. She had given her whole adult life to pursuing a dream and never once doubted she would succeed. Now she did, and it was messing with her mind. What would she do if she couldn’t make music? Work in an office like a drone? Fuck that.

“He fills your needs to fullest measure,” a woman sang from somewhere in the woods.

Dove snapped up like she was spring-loaded. She had been sure she was alone out here, so some random woman singing set her on edge. She wiped the tears from her eyes and glanced around the trees to see if she could find the singer.

While scanning the treeline, she discovered a faint path about ten feet away. It cut off into the wilderness and wasn’t marked on any map she knew. Dove had been coming to these woods for decades and walked this trail so often she could do it blindfolded and not miss a turn. But this little path was new to her.

“With what discerning love had sent,” the woman sang again. Her voice was as clear as a summer morning and more beautiful than Dove had ever heard. While she was scared that someone else was out here, potentially spying on her, she wasn’t mad at the singing.

“Hello?” Dove called out as she climbed to her feet. “Anyone out there?”

There was no response.

Dove took a few tentative steps towards the side trail. Something about the song was calling her. She felt it in the base of her skull. She went to the fork in the trail and looked out into the brush.

The cut-off looked like nothing more than a game trail. Dove imagined squirrels and rabbits darting across the path over the years, slowly wearing down the vegetation to nothing. It definitely didn’t look like people took this path. Until now.

“Doubt not our inmost wants are known,” the voice sang. It was coming from further down the tiny, winding path.

Dove swallowed hard and walked along the game trail, unsure what she would find but ready for anything. She held her plastic vodka bottle by the neck for protection. It came naturally to her after years spent playing in small bars with handsy dudes who can’t take “no” for an answer. Dove hoped it wouldn’t come to all that.

After following the game trail for about fifteen feet, Dove found a small dirt clearing between five sprawling trees. A quick look showed no other routes out of the clearing except the one she was standing on. It seemed this was a gathering place of some kind because the dirt was covered with the footprints of different animals. At first blush, the impressions seemed to crisscross with one another. Yet, after focusing on one set, Dove noticed the footprints went around in circles until they stopped in the middle of the clearing. None of the prints led back out.

“To him who chose us for his own,” the voice sang, holding the last word for a few notes.

Dove whipped around to where she heard the voice and spotted a woman standing at the far edge of the clearing on the opposite side of the trail. She stayed in the shadows but didn’t try to hide. The two women stood across from one another, not speaking. Dove finally swallowed and broke the silence.

“That was a lovely song,” Dove finally said.

“Do you know it?” the woman asked.

Dove shook her head no. “What was it?”

“An old hymn,” the woman said.

Dove smiled, “Might be why I don’t know it. My people aren’t hymnal people.”

“You’re a singer, yes?”

“I am...how did you know?”

“I heard you singing on the trail.”

Dove laughed. This siren before her had been singing an ancient gospel hymn, and Dove had been drunkenly belting out Madonna. If there were ever a starker contrast between two people, she didn’t know it. After a little laugh, she responded, “Yes, that was me. Sorry if it sounded out of tune.”

“No, it was lovely.”

“Not compared to your voice. Your singing was otherworldly. Do you sing professionally?”

“I only sang in the church, but that was long ago.”

“Well, if you can sing hip-hop-infused metal, you’ll have a future in the business,” Dove said. “What are you doing out here?”

“I live out here,” the woman said.

“In the woods?”

“It’s peaceful,” she said. “Don’t you think?”

“I do,” Dove said, “I come out here to…”

“Cry?”

Dove forced a smile, “Among other things, yes. Hey, can you step out from the trees? I’m not going to bite you or anything.”

“I’m afraid if you saw me, you’d stop talking to me.”

Dove laughed again, “What? Why would I stop talking to you?”

“I have that effect on people.”

“Not on me. Come on, step into the light. Please?”

After a beat, the woman walked from the shadows and into the dimly lit clearing. She was stunning. Her alabaster white skin was flawless and contrasted with her big brown doe eyes. Her hair, a dark black, was in two braids that reached her shoulders. She wore a modest gray shirt with a long black skirt that brushed against her ankles. She wore a necklace, but the pendant was tucked under her shirt. Dove assumed it was a cross because this woman looked like she had just left church.

“Wow,” Dove said, “If people are running away from you, what chance do us normies have?”

“Some people don’t like the sight of me.”

“Are they blind?” Dove joked.

The woman gave her a polite curtsy. Dove looked around at the forest and shook her head. “Do you see a lot of people out here? This place seems hidden.”

“People come when they are searching for something,” the woman said. “Are you searching for something?”

“Yeah, a record deal. Have one of those handy?”

“I might,” the woman said softly.

“Excuse me?”

“I might be able to help with that wish if you’d like.”

“You have a recording studio out here?”

“No, but I have ways to make these things happen.”

Dove laughed, more out of confusion than anything. “How?”

“Like I said,” the woman said, stepping towards Dove, “people come here when they’re searching for something. If I can help, I help.”

“I came out here to get away from the world. I didn’t expect to find anyone else in the woods.”

“But you did find someone. A very powerful someone that can make your dreams come true.”

“This...this is fuckin’ weird, man,” Dove said, taking a cautious step back.

“I am telling you the truth, Dove.”

This caught Dove by surprise. “How did you know….”

“I know so much, dear,” the woman said, continuing her march forward. With each step, the woman’s appearance changed. Wrinkles appeared on her face, white streaks slashed her black hair, her back stooped, and her teeth darkened and decayed in her mouth. It was like each footfall brought on ten years of aging. Standing in the middle of the clearing now was the desiccated husk of the beautiful woman Dove had just been speaking to.

Dove wanted to run, but her legs weren’t listening to her brains. Instead, her brain was telling her to relax. Maybe this magical woman did have something she needed. Could she help her in her moment of need? Was this what religious people felt like when they prayed to God?

“What can you really do for me?”

“I can give you what you want,” she hissed, “for a price, of course.”

“What’s the price?”

“Nothing you can’t handle, dear,” the woman said. “Some hair from the person that wronged you, a drop of blood from your finger, and the item you want me to enchant.” She pointed at Dove’s pants. Dove slapped her thigh and felt the cassette tape in there. How in the world did the old lady know that was in there?

“Hair and a drop of blood? You get those, and I become a star?” Dove asked credulously.

The woman nodded. Without waiting for Dove’s answer, she motioned, “Bring me that item, dear.”

Dove hesitated and then shrugged. What the fuck did she have to lose at this point? Truthfully, she had already been thinking about ways to get a bit of Kevin’s hair without sleeping with him. It would be awkward, but she could pull it off. Especially if superstardom was on the line.

Dove handed the cassette to the old lady, who stared at it like she had never seen anything like it before. She held it out on her flat left hand and beckoned Dove closer. The old woman quickly grabbed Dove’s arm and clenched it tight.

“You’re stronger than you look,” Dove said, trying to joke away her anxiety.

“Hold your hand over this,” the old lady said, placing Dove’s hand over the cassette. Before Dove could breathe, the old woman swiped her thumb across Dove’s palm, slicing open a cut. Dove yelped but didn’t pull away. The old woman squeezed her hand like a lemon to wring out a few drops of blood.

The old woman finally released her hand. Dove turned it upside down to glimpse the wound but saw it magically close before her eyes. Seconds later, it was like her hand had never been sliced open in the first place.

“Our pact is sealed,” the old woman said, “return with the hair within two days, or you will shrivel and die where you stand.”

Dove gulped. The realization of what happened was finally starting to break through. She steadied herself and asked calmly, “This is all you need from me? Hair, blood, and cassette?”

“It is enough for me.”

“When I get the hair, how can I find you?”

“The same way you did now.”

“Do I have to drink cheap vodka to get here?”

The old woman cackled and slowly walked backwards to where she had come from. As she did, the years melted off her. By the time she was back in the safety of the trees, she looked like the young woman Dove had first laid eyes on.

“God will never forsake in need,” the beautiful voice sang, “the soul that trusts in him indeed.”

After the song, the disembodied voice started laughing. It grew more frenzied the longer it went on. By the time Dove turned and ran back to her car, the manic laughter was the only thing she could hear.

\*\*\*

“I didn’t think you ever wanted to see me again,” Kevin said, adding, “considering your parting words to me were far less than warm.”

“I can be emotional,” Dove said with a shrug, “you’ve heard my music. Shouldn’t have been a big surprise.”

Kevin let out a small chuckle. This was the first time Dove had ever seen him show any joy. “I suppose so. I am sorry about what happened, but I did mean what I said. This is a special album, but the label won’t publish it. I tried, I really did.”

“That a fact?” Dove said, taking a sip of her soda. She wasn’t sure if Kevin was telling the truth or saving face. The laugh did unsettle her, though. Made him seem almost human.

“I’ve been talking you guys up for a while. I’ve played snippets of songs to them. I went to the mat, but they wouldn’t budge,” he said with a sigh, “sometimes, this business makes no sense.”

“Often,” Dove said.

“Do you have any other contacts at other labels? If not, I can give you a few leads.”

“I found one that’s going to help, thanks.”

“Good for you,” Kevin said, “I hope it pays off.” As he said it, a stray lock of hair fell in front of his face. This was the chance Dove had been waiting for. She reached over the table, wrapped it in her fingers, and yanked.

Kevin screamed in pain as a large clump was ripped from the roots. Dove looked down at the hair and smiled. She could feel everyone looking at her, but she didn’t care. In a day’s time, they wouldn’t be staring at her because she did something crazy. They’d be staring because she was a star.

Kevin trained his manic eyes on her. A small rivulet of blood trickled down his forehead. “What the fuck was that for?”

“Fame, Kev. Fame. Thanks for the drink!” She turned and sprinted out of the restaurant.

\*\*\*

It was nearly dusk by the time Dove got to the forest. After dashing out of the restaurant and tearing down the street, she accidentally hit a curb and popped two tires. It had taken hours for a wrecker to haul her to a nearby shop and hours still to find a tire that fit her car. A few hundred dollars later, she hit the road for the mountains.

She was racing against the coming night. The last thing she wanted was to get lost in these woods as the sun slipped away. In the dark, every tree looked the same. She could imagine herself walking in circles for eternity and never finding her way out.

Dove trudged up the trail and nearly missed the cut-off this time. She blamed the lack of cheap vodka in her system. Sobriety had dulled her senses. Eventually, her eagle eyes found the small trail, and she started laughing. If she had gotten lost and her time ran out, she’d be a pile of ash scattered to the wind.

Before too long, she got to the clearing. This time, the old woman stood in the middle of the circling animal footprints waiting for Dove. She gave her a smile that showed off her rotten teeth. Dove didn’t care. She walked right up to her and presented her hand stuffed with Kevin’s hair.

“You did this with time to spare, dear.”

“No rest for the wicked.”

“So true,” the old woman said, taking the hair from her hands. She cackled as she looked at Kevin’s liberated locks. “This will do nicely.”

Dove watched as the old woman held the hair to her own forehead and mumbled some incantations. The hair ignited and burned as quickly as gasoline-soaked straw would. As the ashes of the burnt hair landed on the ground, the clearing took on a faint white glow. To Dove’s amazement, a spiral pattern of white lines emerged from the ground. The spiral ended where the old woman stood.

“What’s happening?” Dove asked, confused.

The old woman didn’t answer. Instead, she fell through the ground like a trap door opened underneath her. She was gone. In her place, a small hole appeared in the dead center of the clearing. Just like that, Dove was alone in the woods.

As she contemplated where the old woman could’ve gone, she heard her song start playing in the air all around her. The epicenter was the hole in the middle of the clearing. The song shot out in all directions like an impact blast from an explosion.

Dove stood there, confused. None of this was making any sense. Worse, her confidence in her actions had suddenly and immensely dropped. Dove felt she had made a grave mistake but didn’t know why. It was that lingering feeling of guilt you get when you leave a self-scan aisle, knowing you didn’t scan everything. The ache in the pit of your stomach, knowing you did something wrong. Only this felt worse. Way worse.

Dove ran. She slashed through the brushes, feeling cuts on her arms but powering through. She needed to get to the parking lot. She got to her car, and all of this would be behind her. As she ran, her song chased after her. Try as she might, the music followed.

She came to a skidding stop near her car and fumbled with her keys until she unlocked the door. She slammed it as if that would keep the rogue music away, but it failed. She placed her keys in the ignition and flexed her hand to start the car but suddenly stopped.

Something had grabbed her mind. It was a voice inside her head that wasn’t her own. It spoke softly and sweetly, lulling her into inaction. Just stop. No reason to panic. Look at how much joy your music brings the world, dear.

Dove heard shuffling outside her car and glanced over in time to see two hikers stumbling past. Their gaits didn’t look natural. They looked like they were being pulled forward. They were smiling, but Dove didn’t think it was voluntary. While they wore grins, their eyes were glassy and lifeless. They nodded their heads to the beat and marched on, unaware or unconcerned of the world around them.

“What the fuck?” Dove muttered. She exited her car and slammed the door, hoping to get the hiker’s attention. They didn’t flinch.

“Hey!” Dove yelled. “Hey! What’re you doing?”

They didn’t respond. They just kept climbing up the trail toward the source of the music. As Dove stood and watched them disappear around a turn on the path, she was bumped in the back by another glassy-eyed hiker. Like the previous two, the hiker ignored her pleas and shambled forward.

Dove looked back towards the entrance to the parking lot and saw more people walking towards the trail. All of them looked glassy-eyed. The songs on the demo tape kept playing in the air around them, overtaking the natural noise of the woods.

Except for one.

Back from where the old woman had been, a loud gurgle occasionally broke through the music. It wasn’t following any pattern, but it was noticeable when it happened. Dove began to panic. This was wrong.

Is it wrong? The soft voice in her head said again. They’re enjoying your music.

“No, they’re not!” Dove screamed to no one. “What are you doing to them? They look like zombies!”

They’ve come under the sway of your melodic voice, dear.

“This isn’t what I wanted! I wanted radio play! I wanted people listening to my music because they liked it, not because it hypnotized them!”

Good music will do that to a person.

There was now a line twenty-five people deep and growing. Cars were pulling off on the side of the road, and the occupants barreling out and joining the legions of fans. Already there were more people here than had ever been at an Absent Father concert. The numbers kept growing.

Over the air, you could hear the gurgling coming more frequently now. It was distorting the music, and Dove felt a chill shoot through her body each time it happened. She wasn’t sure what was happening, but she knew it wasn’t good.

Easy dear. It’s just part of the deal. You’re a hit now. This is your dream.

“This is a nightmare,” Dove spat.

That’s when Dove saw someone in the line she recognized. Kevin. Stumbling forward with the rest, wearing a blissful smile. She ran to him and pushed him to get his attention, but Kevin never broke stride. She slapped his face and screamed his name, but he was lost now.

“Kevin, I’m sorry. Please wake up!”

“Good tune,” he said in a robotic voice.

The gurgles were coming fast now. Even though Dove knew she should leave, she had to see what was happening in the woods. What horrors had she helped to unleash on the world?

No horror, dear. Salvation.

Dove ran as fast as she could up the trail. She passed by men, women, and children, all mindlessly walking forward toward the game trail. Dove shoved past them all, ran to the clearing, and came to a screeching halt.

The people were walking in circles, following the white lines in the clearing until they reached what now was a small cave in the middle of the clearing. She watched in horror as a teenage kid took his final steps and tumbled into the hole. The hole gurgled as he disappeared from sight, and Dove suddenly realized what was happening. It wasn’t a cave the people were falling into.

It was the old woman’s mouth.

She was swallowing these people whole. They made the gurgling sound as she swallowed them down her gullet and into her acidic stomach. No one made any noise or struggled. They just fell to their deaths. As soon as one person disappeared, the next fell in.

“Why are you doing this?” Dove said, tears streaming down her face.

He fills your needs to fullest measure. With what discerning love had sent. Doubt not our inmost wants are known. To him who chose us for his own.

Dove felt a sudden stinging in the base of her skull. It hurt for a second, but then it felt...great. She didn’t hear the gurgling anymore. Just the music. It was pleasant. She started nodding her head, and a huge grin crossed her face. Dove was no longer worried or stressed about anything. The music had her now. All was right with the world.

“Good tune,” she said, joining the circling group of people in the clearing. She shuffled along the white lines until she stood over the yawning maw in front of her. The gaps between the jagged teeth were filled with bits of bloody flesh. The tongue was covered in razor-sharp spurs and lolled back in forth below her.

Beyond that was the darkness of the old woman’s stomach. What lay beyond there was anyone’s guess, but Dove didn’t care. Salvation lay just a few steps ahead. “Good tune,” she mumbled, holding her right foot over the hole and taking her final step.",1,1760748812.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False
