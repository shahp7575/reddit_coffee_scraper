Disclaimer: not a coffee/matcha connoisseur, that’s why I wanted to keep this review as short as possible, hence the title. These are just based on my personal preferences. Here's an improved version of my review earlier:

Cinnamon Cruffin – 👍🏻 masarap!
parang Cinnamon Danish ng SB + the cinnamon icing, mas maliit lang and mas pricey (P220-P240 i forgot) pero kung may babalikan man ako dito, ito yun

Spanish Latte (P190?)– 👎🏼 i want my spanish latte creamy, and this one wasn't creamy enough for me.

Matcha (P220?) – 👎🏼 not for me. bland, di ko malasahan damo haha, not bitter, not sweet, not very smooth may onting grain lang ng very slight, not creamy as well

Ambiance was nice enough, pero may constant beeping sound from the aircon, siguro dahil brownout kaya it wasn’t working normally?? The wifi was also slow at times pero workable naman. 

The staff was nice! He introduced their bestsellers, apologized na ubos na yung strawberry cheesecake yata yun, and mentioned their new croissant additions. I asked him what his personal favorite pastry was, and it didn’t disappoint.

Honestly, I wasn't even planning on going here since yung nakita kong comments about this place was pricey nga daw and to go to Butter Way instead. Still glad i tried their cinnamon cruffin kasi it turned out masarap naman pala, more reason to try their other croissants.

I believed him. I sympathized. I was heartbroken.

But even back then, something felt off. His posts about being *aped weren’t raw or unfiltered — they were filmed, styled, curated, and edited like trailers for a Sundance doc. Strange, but I told myself: trauma looks different for everyone, don’t judge. Benefit of the doubt.

Then came the assisted suicide saga. And the second I saw it, I thought: this can’t be real. The Netherlands doesn’t hand out euthanasia approvals like coffee punch cards. The way he framed it read more like a pitch deck than a legal process. I was incredibly suspicious — but I also felt like a monster for doubting him. Like maybe I was the cruel one for questioning someone’s suffering.

However, there is a caveat.

The stock tips on this are extremely horrible. It makes the IEMs extremely bright. The treble is literally piercing my ears without eartip changing.

Give it some good wide bore eartips like the Coffee or (on my case) Moondrop Spring Tips and you bring out it's full potential.

This is gonna be a *dumb* comparison (and thing to say). However out of all my IEMs—my Truthear Nova has the most oomph and spice. My Blessing 3 has the most clarity and detail.

I'd say the Daybreak is a good middle ground. It has the right amount of spice and oomph like the Nova however with better clarity. It is **not** as clear as the Blessing 3. However, for the price range—it's really damn good.

170 USD for this is an amazing value.

Regarding everything else, the accesories for this IEM are.....meh. But honestly that's fine. You can order wide bore eartips like the Spring Tips online for 10 USD. I don't expect them to make the box and accesories extra fancy due to them cutting cost to (probably) keep this IEM at a good price range.

*Should you buy this?*

Yeah, I would say go for it if you're willing to change eartips. And I'd say also yes if you listen to exciting types of music (J-Pop, K-Pop,  video game OST) because it really does a damn job.

I would check out Listener's review regarding this on the Headphones website. He explains everything much better than me. I just wanted to leave my opinion regarding this on Reddit.

I have been working on a small side project that I finally feel ready to share, I know it’s another productivity app, but give it a try, you won’t regret :)

It’s a simple AI-powered “second brain”: you type anything (a note, task, idea, or reminder), and it automatically classifies it, extracts due dates, and shows you a Today view with upcoming reminders.

Some things you can try:
-  “Remind me to call John tomorrow at 3pm”
-	“Meeting with Sarah Friday at 10am about invoices”
- “Idea: start a blog on coffee brewing tips”

It’s free to use, I would love a few testers to try it and tell me what feels useful or bad.

1mxtl6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstroHustle/comments/1mxtl6g/mercury_retrograde_the_hustlers_survival_guide/,Mercury Retrograde: The Hustler's Survival Guide (November 9 2025),"Alright hustlers, let's talk about the elephant in the room. The one everyone from your yoga instructor to your tech-illiterate uncle loves to blame for their problems: **Mercury Retrograde.**

For the uninitiated, it's the 3-4 week period, three-ish times a year, when Mercury *appears* to be moving backward in its orbit. Astrologically, it's associated with communication breakdowns, tech failures, travel delays, and general ""wtf is happening"" energy.

Most people see it as a time to hide under the covers. But not us. We're builders, creators, and innovators. We don't have time to shut down for a month. So instead of fearing it, we're going to **hack it.**

Think of it not as a stop sign, but as a giant, cosmic **""REVIEW & REVISE""** button.

# What NOT To Do (The Classic Hustler Traps)

This is where most go wrong. Do NOT use this energy to:

* **Launch Your Big Thing:** New website, product line, major campaign? The data will be flawed, the messaging will be misread. Just don't.
* **Sign Major Contracts:** Unless you want to be renegotiating every clause in three weeks, hold off. If you MUST, have your lawyer triple-check everything.
* **Make Big Purchases (Especially Tech/Vehicles):** That new laptop will be a lemon. That ""perfect"" CRM software will have hidden bugs. Wait.
* **Assume Your Communication Was Received:** That ""yes"" in an email might mean ""maybe."" That clear instruction will be misunderstood. Follow up, clarify, confirm.

# What TO Do: The Hustler's Playbook

This is where we thrive. Mercury Retrograde is a powerful time for **re-** activities. Lean into it.

**1. RE-visit & RE-finance:**

* **Old Leads:** Go through your CRM. Every ""maybe"" and ""not right now"" from the last 6 months. Reconnect. They're more likely to be receptive now.
* **Finances:** Review subscriptions, expenses, and invoices. Find old debts owed to you. Send those gentle reminders. It's the perfect time for collections.
* **Pricing & Packages:** Is your pricing structure optimal? Re-work your service tiers. It's a review period, not a launch period.

**2. RE-organize & RE-systemize:**

* **Digital Declutter:** Clean up your desktop, organize your Google Drive, sort your emails. A clean digital space prevents retrograde meltdowns.
* **Back. Everything. Up.** Seriously. Do it today.
* **Tweak Your Workflows:** Is your client onboarding process clunky? Does your editing pipeline have a bottleneck? Fix the systems you already have.

**3. RE-connect & RE-network:**

* **Past Clients & Colleagues:** This is retrograde gold. Hit up old clients for testimonials or referrals. Grab a virtual coffee with a former colleague. The energy is perfect for rekindling old connections, not making new ones.
* **Masterminds & Communities:** (Hey, like this one!) Engage deeper in existing groups instead of seeking out new ones. The discussions will be more reflective and insightful.

**4. RE-st & RE-flect:**

* **Strategic Planning:** This is a forced pause. Use it. Where has your hustle been on autopilot? Where are you forcing something that isn't working? Journal on it.
* **Creative Ideas:** Write down every idea that comes to you, but **do not act on them yet.** Let them marinate. Post-retrograde, you'll see which ones have real legs.

# The Hustler's Retrograde Mantra:

This isn't woo-woo; it's strategy. The cosmos is forcing a review cycle. The most successful hustlers are the most adaptable ones. So adapt.

**Upcoming Mercury retrograde:** \[**November 9, 2025**, and ends on **November 29, 2025**\]

1mxtl52,https://www.reddit.com/r/chennaicity/comments/1mxtl52/thank_you_chennai/,Thank you Chennai 🥹❤️,"I never thought I would say this, but here I go—thank you so much, Chennai, for making me who I am.

I came to Chennai in the middle of 2023. I had visited the city a few times since my childhood, and Chennai was always glorified in my family. My grandparents moved here after their marriage, built a house, raised three kids (including my mom), and gave them a good education. Then the generation repeated itself when I came here to pursue my master’s.

At first, I didn’t like it—I didn’t like the people, the weather, the food, or the traffic. Literally, nothing appealed to me. But little did I know, I was building memories in this beautiful city.

The late-night rides to Kathipara and Chaiwala, Ram’s tea and Ceylon bun muska that became a savior during my final semester when we needed to unwind after a stressful week, the breeze of Marina and Bessy, the corn we ate there, the movie nights, the T-Nagar shopping trips…

Even though I’m an atheist, I went to Vadapalani Murugan Temple for my girlfriend’s birthday which was also compelled by my dear murugan lovers of chennai❤️ and guess what it was so wholesome 🥹❤️. Sangeetha’s filter coffee, the chicken rice, Mani’s and SS biryani, TASMAC sarakku, the Egmore Museum, Dakshinchitra, night drives along ECR, and those small talks with auto-walas and Uber-walas—all of it has a special place in my heart.

When I finally left Chennai for a job, I realized how much I had changed, and how much the city had changed me. Thank you, Chennai ❤️

And the truth is, like they say:
“Enga beach-u kaathu mela patta pothum da, unakku nalla raasi da.
Ini nee Chennai vaasi da.”

No matter how many negatives you count, Chennai will always have 100× more positives. ❤️ Forever grateful—and I’ll be back. 🫴❤️

## What is GlavixPro?

GlavixPro is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users make informed investment decisions in real-time. It uses smart algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades, aiming to maximize potential profits for its users. This platform supports a wide range of assets, including **cryptocurrencies**, **stocks**, **forex**, and more.

The cool part? You don’t need to be a financial genius to use it. It’s tailored to be user-friendly, even for someone who’s never traded before. That’s probably why it’s gaining popularity so fast. It’s like having a trading assistant that works 24/7 without needing a coffee break.

## Who Created GlavixPro?

The creators behind GlavixPro are a bit of a mystery, which is pretty typical in the world of automated trading platforms. That said, the system seems to be developed by a group of **financial analysts and software engineers** with backgrounds in AI-driven trading tools.

While there’s no ""famous face"" behind it like Elon Musk or Brian Armstrong (not me, the other one 😉), the tech and interface speak for themselves. From what I could tell, GlavixPro is partnered with **regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of credibility. It may not have a big brand name behind it yet, but it’s clearly built by people who know the industry.

## How Does GlavixPro Work?

GlavixPro runs on **automated algorithms** that scan market data in real-time to find potentially profitable trades. Once it spots a trend, it can either suggest trades for you to approve or execute them automatically if you’ve enabled that setting.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:
- You create an account and deposit funds.
- The platform links you to a regulated broker.
- The algorithm starts analyzing market patterns.
- Based on the data, it places trades on your behalf (if you allow it).

It's sort of like setting your Spotify to auto-play and discovering new songs you didn’t know you’d love—except here, it’s trying to grow your money.

## GlavixPro Pros and Cons

Let’s be honest, no platform is perfect. Here's what I liked and didn’t like about GlavixPro:

**Pros**
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly interface**  
- ✅ **Supports multiple asset types**  
- ✅ **Fast, real-time data analysis**  
- ✅ **Demo account to practice before risking real money**  
- ✅ **Partnered with regulated brokers**  
- ✅ **Mobile-friendly**  

**Cons**

## What Devices Can be Used to Access GlavixPro?

GlavixPro works on most modern devices. You can use it on:
- **Desktops & Laptops** (Windows, Mac)
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android)

There’s no standalone app yet, which is kind of a bummer, but the website is fully optimized for mobile. I tested it on Safari and Chrome on my phone—it ran smoothly with no glitches. Honestly, I didn’t even miss having an app.

## GlavixPro – Supported Countries

One thing I appreciate about GlavixPro is its **broad availability**. It supports users from over 120 countries, including:

- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Australia
- Most of Europe
- Parts of Asia and South America

Some countries with strict financial regulations (like North Korea or Iran) may be restricted. But for most of us, getting started is pretty straightforward.

## GlavixPro – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is probably GlavixPro’s biggest strength. The platform scans thousands of data points per second, using AI to identify trends. It’s like having a Wall Street analyst living in your laptop—minus the expensive suit and coffee addiction.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. Even if you’re new to trading, you won’t feel like you’re trying to decode rocket science. Everything’s labeled clearly, and the onboarding process is smooth.

### Mobile Accessibility

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **price alerts**, **news triggers**, and more. This is super helpful if you want to stay updated without being glued to your screen. Think of it like having a personal assistant who only interrupts you when it matters.

### Multiple Asset Trading

GlavixPro isn’t just for crypto. You can also trade:
- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Indices**
- **Commodities**

That kind of variety is great if you want to diversify your portfolio without switching platforms all the time.

## Is GlavixPro a Scam?

Ah, the million-dollar question.

From what I’ve seen and tested, **GlavixPro doesn’t show any red flags** commonly associated with scams. It connects you to **regulated brokers**, doesn’t promise unrealistic profits (like ""make $10,000/day""), and offers a fully functional demo account.

That said, always use caution. Don’t dump your life savings into any platform. Start small, test it out, and see if it works for you.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on GlavixPro?

The minimum deposit to start trading is **$250**. That’s pretty standard for platforms in this category, though I get that it might be a bit high for total beginners.

The good news? You can use the **demo account** first to get a feel for the platform before committing real money.

### GlavixPro Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via email and live chat**. I tested the live chat feature, and someone responded in under 3 minutes. They were friendly, knowledgeable, and didn’t just send copy-paste answers.

## How do you start trading on GlavixPro?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the GlavixPro website and fill out the quick registration form. You’ll need to provide:
- Your name
- Email address

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After signing up, you’ll get connected to a partner broker. You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff) and deposit at least $250 to activate your trading account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can either:
- Use the **demo account** to practice
- Dive right into **live trading**
You can customize your trading settings or let the algorithm do its thing.

## How to Delete a GlavixPro Account?

If you decide it’s not for you, deleting your account is simple. Just contact customer support and request account deletion. They’ll walk you through it and confirm via email. Make sure to withdraw any remaining funds beforehand.

You see, even my vanilla hobby of watching Kdrama shows has BDSM related episode. Lol 

Basically the plaintiff wanted to sue her ex-boyfriend for assault. These are some facts that she provided:

* She knows her skin is prone to keloid scars but she still went through the sadistic sexual plays

* She felt pressured to say yes because she was afraid to lose him. She didn't think she even had a choice.

* She signed a contract as part of their ritual.

* She has little to no knowledge about BDSM. When her lawyers asked, she doesn't even know masochism means.


The law firm wanted to go after the guy under the grounds of assault. In order for them to do that, they need to prove that the consent given was invalid. They wanted to argue the following points:

* The plaintiff was in a diminished capacity to decide because she was in love. Thus, not in the best state to give true consent.

* Genuine consent must be voluntary. If the consent was given under psychological pressure it can't be considered legally valid.

* She does not fully understanding the implications of what she was about to do.

* It was found out the complainant doesn't even know enough about the D/S dynamic she entered. She doesn't even know the word masochism.

What are your thoughts about this situation? I know this is just fictional. But as a sadist who really intends to do real life application of my kink, I may take a double take on the possible legal implications 😅

I am really disappointed this didn't go on trial. So I want to hear your thoughts on this folks. I'll be happy if an actual lawyer will read this. Lol

About the Game
==============

**SeaBed** is a critically acclaimed yuri-themed mystery visual novel told through the perspectives of three separate characters: Mizuno Sachiko, a designer plagued by hallucinations of her past lover; Narasaki Hibiki, Sachiko's friend and a psychiatrist researching the workings of human memories; and Takako, Sachiko's former lover who has been rapidly forgetting her past, including how or why the two women drifted apart despite being together since childhood.

All three live in different worlds, but seek the same goal. To separate truth from illusion. To make sense of their own lives.

The Steam version of SeaBed has been updated to natively support 1440x1080 resolution.

Characters:
-----------

*""At times, I'd wake up at night and hear all the sounds around me as if they were amplified. I'd feel like my head could burst at any second.""*

Although she moved to Tokyo straight after graduating university in order to seek employment, Mizuno Sachiko soon quit her job to establish Clover Design with her childhood friend Takako, becoming its young CEO.

Her main hobby is reading, but only because nothing else manages to interest her. Although Sachiko used to be quite an avid reader during her school years, finding a job means she now only opens a book every once in a while, whenever her schedule allows it.

After meeting Takako – an inexhaustible source of enthusiasm, as well as a stark contrast to her own personality – during her childhood years, Sachiko’s interests began to shift to whatever the other woman was doing at a given time.

*""This is as good a time as any, so let's check it out.""*

Endlessly interested in and enthusiastic about the world, Takako gives the impression of a woman perpetually stuck in her childhood.

She fell in love with Sachiko at first sight back when they first met at the age of five. However, she does not identify as a homosexual, stressing that Sachiko simply happened to be a woman.

Takako discovers that she suffers from developmental amnesia, a condition that severely impairs her ability to recall many of her memories.

*""I just like observing people.""*

A psychiatrist at Narasaki Mental Clinic. She was Sachiko's classmate and friend during her elementary school years, but the two drifted apart as they enrolled in different middle schools. After learning that Sachiko has been experiencing hallucinations, she takes it upon herself to treat her.

She is extremely picky about her brand of coffee, perhaps because the beverage serves as her sole companion during those long hours spent immersed in research.

Though not religious, she is a strong believer that everything happens for a reason, and all things have their place and order in the grand scheme of the world.

Strap yourselves in cause this is going to be a long one. Last time we arrived at Luin, the city of hope. At this point I’m starting to get a little anxious about the Sword Dancer, it’s been a while and I fear I’m getting close to not being able to fight him anymore, but I don’t know how to return to that area yet. My Raine has Photon and my characters are around level 20 so I’m getting close to the point you guys recommended to fight him. Please let me know if I still have some time or if I should figure out how to get back as soon as possible.

We start to explore the town. Talking to the people around town we learn it’s built on top of Sinoa Lake. A lot of the culture here is about fishing, but the yield has been declining, probably because of the mana shortage. I also find out that if I head north from here I’ll find the Tower of Mana. As we learned recently, this is a different tower from the Tower of Salvation. Apparently the Mana Tower was sealed because of a monster infestation, but the church here in Luin manages it. I’m guessing here’s where we’ll come when it’s time to head there.

The equipment here is a downgrade from the stuff in Asgard for some reason. About the only new things to buy are rabbit’s feet. On the next screen we find our girl Sheena! She’s playing hide and seek with some kids. Lloyd tells her she’s cute and she gets pissed and runs off. I’m guessing she’s our resident tsundere. Talking to people around here we learn about another town called Hima, which sounds like it’s pretty run down. We also learn people live in constant fear of the human ranch to the northeast. I’m tired of these stupid human ranches, I hope we get rid of this one soon.

On the next screen we learn the mayor of Luin was killed by the Desians, so right now they’re mayor-less. It seems the situation here with the ranch is pretty dire. The mayor’s house was transformed into an item shop meanwhile. Heading into the shop I spot a weird object, and we all know what that means! It’s Wonder Chef time! This time we learn seafood stew, which is appropriate for a fishing village. It restores TP which is awesome! The only other building left is the church, which as I mentioned before manages the Tower of Mana. Apparently this only involves sorting books on the first floor but it’s still quite a task. The priest mentions not knowing where they put Boltzman’s Book. Ummmm ok? I don’t know what that is and I certainly didn’t ask about that you crazy priest!

After this small detour we’re ready to continue the story. Thanks to u/yuki_onoki ’s directions I’m all set to go. Coming out of Luin, I spot the monument guidepost thing just north of town. Score! We can also see a tower in the distance which I assume is the Tower of Mana. On the way back we also spot what seems to be the human ranch. It’s a long but easy ride to the Balacruf Mausoleum, and near it I found a chest with a Strike Ring just sitting there in the open. It might be useful at some point. I almost missed it since I was riding Noishe but since I’m paranoid I keep getting off and on every few steps to make sure there isn’t a chest lying around.

Aaaaanyway, once inside the Mausoleum Raine gives us instructions on how to proceed. First, we say hi to little Pepe of course. Good boyyy! Nearby is his owner who confirms his name is Pepe. How did Colette know? Uncanny! Nearby we find a tourist and right next to him is a chest with 1800 gald. It’s right there in plain sight, how did he miss it? Maybe it’s his money and we stole it? Whatever the case it’s very welcome.

We proceed to gain entrance to the dungeon with the help of the map and make our way in. I’m not looking forward to this dungeon at all, given all you guys have told me about it. It sounds like a real pain but hey, the world needs saving and we’re the only ones on the job. Let’s try to get through this as painlessly as possible.

Right away I get hit by a trap. Stupid spikes coming out of the stupid floor. I went back the other way and found a torch but when I light it the wind blows it off. I guess I have to go back to the trap and get through it to turn off the wind somehow. I manage to get past the trap by triggering it, backing off and then immediately running over it when it retracted but it took a few tries.

Past the trap I find a box that I push on top of a very obvious tile, and that stops the wind. That was easier than expected! I also get the memory gem for the locked memory circle that was beside the unlightable torch. This obviously debunks my theory that the locked memory circle is always right before the boss. Maybe there are 2 of them in this dungeon?

Heading back through the annoying trap I get back to the torch, light it and… nothing happens. Upon closer inspection there’s a slab on the wall I didn’t notice before. I’m guessing I couldn’t see it until I lit the torch and that was the point of doing that. Upon examining it I get some sort of hint saying that the summon spirit and the wind that serves it are found beyond the carving of the holy seal. Ok then.

I head back to where I stopped the wind to explore the northern part of that area, since I left this area hastily when I figured out how to stop the wind. Here, I noticed another torch/slab combo. This one reads more like trivia than a true hint, saying the Balacruf people are born with the wind, live with Sylph and then become wind when they die. Cool, cool cool cool.

The next one beside it is more cryptic. It says that the world is a giant and its ruby left hand is the throne of gods, while the emerald right hand is the power of gods. The pearl-white left leg is the calm earth and its topaz right leg is the rich earth. Finally, its lapis lazuli body is the blue wind princess. Complete nonsense but I’m sure it’s a hint for a future puzzle (which is why I’m writing all this down).

After some more exploring I find the next one that says “that which the blue wind princess protects heads from the throne of gods and across the rich earth, stands upon the calm earth and gazes up at the power of the gods.” This references the same stuff as the previous tablet, so I think it’s telling me the order in which I have to make some object travel or something. The hints here are actually pretty good compared to the one in the Desian base puzzle with the GameCube thing.

We open a hidden door by lighting a couple of torches but I want to fully explore this room first so I can get all the clues before moving on to the actual puzzle. Next tablet reads: “the great king of Balacruf, Cleo III, died and was reborn as the king of the wind.” I thought Cleo was a woman! It goes on to say that the king travels the heavens with the summon spirit in past, present and future. Hm. Ok I have a theory about what this means but it’s a little out there so bear with me.

In Tales of Phantasia we see Sylph depicted as not one being, but multiple. What if these are the spirits of the dead Balacruf people, and they are all the wind spirit? After all, when the Balacruf die they “become the wind.” That could mean the main spirit is this King of the Wind which used to be Cleo III. Another possible interpretation is that the King of the Wind is the guardian of the wind seal and the upcoming boss fight is against him. Or maybe I’m overthinking it and it’s just a clue to the puzzle/another puzzle. I’ll tell you in like 15 minutes when I (probably) find out.

Next tablet basically says throne of the gods -> power of gods -> rich earth -> calm earth -> blue wind princess, like traveling the giant’s body clockwise. Ok so there are at least 2 items that must take a specific path through the giant’s body.

Sigh. I’m getting tired of these tablets. The last one (I hope) says that the holy seal that extols the king flows: throne of the gods -> rich earth -> power of gods -> calm earth. Then the blue princess is born in the center and the holy seal is complete. Phew! Finally we can move on.

There’s one of those sorcerer ring function-changing things that I had been ignoring since I needed fire to light the torches, but now I’m ready to move on so I went to check it out. It gave me wind powers, so NOW I think I’m ready to tackle the puzzle.

As soon as I go into the doorway, we get a scene outside with Sheena trying to come in after us. Again. I guess she’s trying to catch us off guard? Noishe blocks her way once again so she summons Corrine to distract him while she runs past him. I guess we’ll be fighting her again, or maybe she’ll fall in a trap and we’ll save her, making her finally join us! One can only hope.

Finally in the puzzle room there’s a bunch of differently colored windmills. So that’s what the wind in the ring is for! From one of the first hints I deduce the order is blue -> red -> yellow -> white -> green. This works, kind of. The door doesn’t open but a piece of wall crumbles revealing a monster and a chest. The chest is just another blue ribbon. I had already got one from another chest in this very dungeon that I gave to Colette. I guess I could give it to Raine but I prefer the intelligence bonus from the gold circlet since she’s a mage.

Ok, let’s try the clockwise one now, the second clue that has to do with these windmill things. I do from red to blue clockwise as instructed and I get another crumbled wall with a monster and a chest. At least this one’s better, netting me an EX Gem Lv. 2!

Ok final one. We do the last combination we got from the tablets, which is red -> yellow -> green -> white -> blue. This makes the door shake a bit but it doesn’t open. Before checking on it we heal up and stuff just in case. We check the door and it opens as expected. It’s showtime!

At the third altar Lloyd complains about being sick of dungeons. This one was actually not bad at all, I even enjoyed it! You guys made it seem so bad in the comments, this was WAY better than the teleporter maze. I was very pleasantly surprised and actually had a good time! We immediately get attacked by the guardian of the seal and it’s a monster thing called Iapyx. There goes my King of the Wind theory. Anyway, we beat it rather easily.

Afterwards we get the same spiel as usual. The voice beckons, Colette prays, Remiel is an asshole, you get the picture. The next seal is northwest, in a place that gazes toward the center of the world. I’m GUESSING it’s the Tower of Mana? That’s northwest from here, and I guess you could see a long distance from the top, including the center of the world, at least of the world map. Colette is almost a true angel now, but I suspect that’s not a good thing. She learns a new magic, Holy Song. It actually sounds pretty neat, increasing the offense and defense of the entire party. Sounds OP actually. Glad to receive it!

We head out to get through the dungeon and get the inevitable scene of Colette collapsing, us camping, blablabla. Except that’s not what happens! As we’re about to step out, little old Sheena stops us. I forgot about her! Why she went to all the trouble of stalking us, hiding out and catching us off guard only to announce herself and lose the element of surprise is beyond me. She attacks and we finally have a rematch. This time she is joined by a lightning summon, which is kind of tough, way more than Sheena, who’s a pushover. As soon as he’s gone she doesn’t last 10 seconds.

Sheena asks why she can’t win, so Genis, who doesn’t understand the concept of rhetorical questions, answers with Dwarven Vow number 7 much to Lloyd’s discontent. Sheena reveals that when the world regeneration journey is complete, her country will be destroyed somehow. That explains why she’s trying to kill Colette, but not why she half-asses it so much. What she says next is very interesting: Colette says that after the journey the world will be saved, and Sheena responds that THEIR world would be saved (as in, not hers). So she IS from another world! Finally I got one theory right! Hooray!!

My take from this is that there are 2 worlds sharing a mana source. When one of the worlds takes too much mana the other one suffers. Completing the Journey of Regeneration will make the balance tip in favor of this world, destroying the other one until whatever event happens that reverses the mana flow. This is my working theory right now, but I don’t know how the Desians fit into it yet. Kratos seems to know something at least. It’s so annoying he won’t just tell us.

Finally we’re able to leave. NOW Colette collapses and Lloyd grabs her, but he drops her somehow. It’s not clear due to the animation, but Colette looks shocked about something. Lloyd finally starts to suspect something’s wrong. Later, while at camp (of course), Lloyd demands to see her hand. It seems she’s bleeding and badly hurt, but she says it doesn’t hurt at all. First she lost her appetite, then her ability to sleep, and now she’s lost all feeling. It’s like she’s becoming a zombie or something. Obviously it’s due to the angel transformation but it makes you wonder what it all means.

Colette tells Lloyd it doesn’t hurt much (instead of at all) so as not to worry him, but he’s finally catching on. He tricks her by telling her he’s giving her hot coffee, and revealing it’s iced when she agrees it’s hot (Genis iced it with magic). She’s like “oh right I meant it’s cold” so Lloyd counters with “turns out it WAS hot all along!” Colette realizes Lloyd outsmarted her and understandably enters a state of shock. I would too if Lloyd of all people outsmarted me.

She finally has no choice but to come clean. What we feared turns out to be true, and all her weird behavior lately is an effect of the angel transformation. Colette is a really strong girl, I’d be freaking out! At least she gained superhuman eyesight and hearing. They embrace and Lloyd starts crying for her. This makes her really happy and she wants to cry as well, but she can’t. Damn.

And this is where we’ll leave it for today. My next destination is Luin, where I need to ask the church for permission to go to the Tower of Mana. At least I believe that’s what we have to do. However, right now I feel I’m strong enough to best the Sword Dancer. If this is a good time to go back and fight him please let me know in the comments (also, how to go back), or if there’s a better opportunity later on let me know as well.

While it’s not backed by a big-name company like Coinbase or Binance, that’s not necessarily a red flag. A lot of solid trading platforms start small. What matters more is transparency, performance, and user experience—and FinUpix does a decent job in those areas.

1mxtcb7,https://i.redd.it/wvoxd7qejpkf1.jpeg,I built a free AI “second brain” app to capture notes & reminders (beta),"Hi everyone,

I have been working on a small side project that I finally feel ready to share, I know it’s another productivity app, but give it a try, you won’t regret :)

It’s a simple AI-powered “second brain”: you type anything (a note, task, idea, or reminder), and it automatically classifies it, extracts due dates, and shows you a Today view with upcoming reminders.

Some things you can try:
-  “Remind me to call John tomorrow at 3pm”
-	“Meeting with Sarah Friday at 10am about invoices”
- “Idea: start a blog on coffee brewing tips”

It’s free to use, I would love a few testers to try it and tell me what feels useful or bad.

Going to put this writeup quick so that everyone reading can make a decision if they want to tail this one or not! Johnny Walker might have scored the game-winning TD for the Bears against the Chiefs today, but I am fading him today!

I like Zhang Mingyang. He is the real deal and he's got serious KO power. Johnny Walker does have experience and has been on the top of this division, but he is not the gatekeeper. I expect Zhang catapult himself to title contention from this fight. Respect for Walker for moving to Vegas and evolving his MMA, but Zhang is just too dangerous. Walker is suspectible to get KO and no matter what training he is doing, if Zhang makes any contact Walker will go down and I just think it's inevitable to happen in the 1st round.

It's too damn juiced to take Zhang Mingyang on the ML or take him to win by KO, so I'm going to handicap an SGP of Zhang to win by via KO and in the 1st round. You can get this at -137 odds on ESPN Bet. If you can get a special market of this type of method/round wit your books on better odds,  take it! Or use your boost if you can! 

I kno taking any fighter by certain method and certain round is intimidating/daring, but to me this a complete mismatch and I am confident Z**hang can take him out in the 1st round. You can see that all of Zhang's last 12 fights has not gone pass the 1st round and were all by KO. WHICH IS INSANE OFC!**

Johnny Walker has also been KO'ed in his last 3 fights (The fight against Ankalev was graded as NC) and he's been KO'ed in the 1st round three of his six previous fights.

But I'm skeptical of it, as someone who neglected dental health for years.","Hello everyone. I suspect that I'm suffering from gum recession so I went to a dentist to have it checked. Don't get me wrong— I trust her. But she's just so nice and I looked really scared that time (I am) that I suspect she might've said an inaccurate diagnosis to calm me down and not hurt my feelings. Honestly, I was about to cry from nervousness that time. She told me that I'm not suffering from periodontal disease, and that my gums are actually pretty healthy which I kinda doubt because I neglected them before. 

As you can see in first and second pic, there are dark yellow areas at the base of my teeth which looked like roots to me, but I don't really know what they are so I'm here to confirm. There are also what looked like gums that receded on them which did not help my overthinking either. 

At third pic, you can see that my gums looked inflamed? Anyway, I searched what healthy gums look like and mine did not look like one, or are there actually different looks for a healthy gum and mine is one of them?

Fourth pic is just what they overall look like. I'm sorry if they are very yellow, I've been addicted to coffee for all these years and I just lately stopped. I don't want to have teeth whitening procedure yet as I still suspect I have some sort of gum disease.

Please, I would really appreciate everyone's insights on my case. It's okay if my case is already bad, I'd accept it. I would rather cry from knowing the truth of my case that be happy in ignorance.

Thank you all so much. I grew up in a family without a care for dental health (it's common here in third world) and I'm just learning about the importance of taking care of my teeth now that I'm 20 so I'm really clueless on a lot of things.

Exercise
Pretty stationary tech job. I picked up jogging and took it seriously. I ran over 25 kilometers this week alone. My 5k personal best is 31 minutes and my 10k personal best is 1 hour and 9 minutes. I bought a kettlebell the other day to do resistance training but I haven't started that yet.

I eat two eggs for breakfast, sometimes with spinach and bell peppers but often alone. I have very small lunches (protein bars or ham/cheese sandwich).

Maybe once every two weeks I'll order out, but it's a burger with no fries or anything or a bowl with lots of veggies.

When people hear:

Anime → Japan

Kpop → Korea

TikTok → China
That’s their brand identity. Cool, global, instantly recognizable.

But India? We’ve got IITs, AIIMS, ISRO literally landing on the Moon’s south pole, we’re the world’s vaccine supplier, and UPI is miles ahead of the US in payments. We do big things—but none of it really makes people go: “That’s Indian—and it’s cool.”

Our apps (Gaana, JioSaavn, Koo, Moj) are decent, but they don’t have that world-class, chic, Gen Z vibe that could make them global. India feels more like the quiet problem-solver—super practical, not flashy. Meanwhile China and Korea went bold: building culture + tech that dominate worldwide.

I can’t help wishing… imagine if people said “Oh that’s Indian” with the same excitement as anime=Japan or kpop=Korea. I want India to feel mysterious, fun, noisy—like the cool uncle at the party that everyone wants to hang with.

So here’s my question:
👉 Can India ever have that “brand moment”?
👉 And would we Indians ourselves back sleek, stylish homegrown apps/brands if they were truly global-class?

Curious what y’all think.

I’m troubleshooting a weird issue with my MaraX V2 (with flow-control) paired with a Zerno Z1 (Lab Sweet burrs, 60–250 µm range) and 1Zpresso Jmax.

Symptoms:

With a blind basket, pump gauge jumps to 9 bar instantly, but grouphead gauge takes ~5 seconds to catch up.

With coffee in the basket, pressure at the group barely rises, maybe 2 bar max, and the shot starts flowing quickly.

Closing the flow-control valve during a shot doesn’t raise group pressure more than ~1 bar (e.g., from 2 to ~3 bar).

With an empty portafilter, pump gauge reads ~5 bar fully open, and only rises if I restrict the flow.


Other notes:

Puck prep is tight, basket is full with minimal headspace.

Tried different roast levels. Light month old roasts to very fresh medium dark to dark roasts. Also tried with Jmax grinder with slightly better results (peek 4bar, falls to 2bars during shot when trying to lower flowrate from peek 4grams per sec)


Taste is consistent with under-extraction (fast, weak shots) with dark roast, soup with light roast (actually good tasting shots).

No water seems to return to the tank or drip tray during extraction.


Has anyone run into this? Possible culprits I’m thinking about:

Stuck or leaking flow-control valve

OPV problem

Internal leak somewhere in the hydraulic path

Manually sifting through market data, competitor websites, and consumer reviews is a grind that can eat up days, if not weeks. What if you could delegate all that heavy lifting to an AI team and get the insights you need to make smart, strategic decisions in minutes?

This isn't about replacing your intuition; it's about giving you a powerful strategic partner. Here’s a quick, three-step AI workflow for a competitive analysis that you can use to get an edge:

1. **Delegate the Research:** Use a **Research AI** like Perplexity to act as your market analyst. Give it a focused prompt to find the data you need.*""Act as a market research analyst. My business is a \[your business type, e.g., 'sustainable coffee brand'\]. My competitors are \[Competitor 1\] and \[Competitor 2\]. Find and summarize the top 3 customer complaints for each competitor from online reviews and social media comments over the last 6 months. Cite your sources.""*
2. **Delegate the Analysis:** Now, take the AI's summarized data and have it analyze it for you in a **Text AI** like ChatGPT or Claude.*""Based on the customer complaints you've just summarized for my competitors, what are the key market gaps or opportunities for my business? Provide a clear, actionable strategy for each opportunity.""*
3. **Delegate the Strategy:** Use the same **Text AI** to turn those strategies into a plan.*""Based on the strategies you've provided, create a concise, 5-point action plan for my marketing and product development teams to capitalize on these opportunities.""*

In just a few minutes, you've gone from a market query to a strategic action plan—something that used to take days of manual research.

There is a lot of details here, some I will unfortunately have to leave out. She also uses Reddit, so I don't want to be too specific if she finds this post. Furthermore, if this post gets too many upvotes, please downvote it to reduce visibility.

  
**Part 1:** Here is the situation: Me (28M) and my friend (27F) have been friends for about a year, and we are very close. We had a brief FWB situation then talked about dating at one point, but she didn't feel ready for a relationship in that moment for various reasons, so we agreed to table that thought. She then got really stressed with life and she got a tad distance. I thought that was the end of the relationship idea and I was fine with the idea of just being normal friends. I mean I was quite dissapointed, but I respect her wishes. We were still good friends and got coffee together in the morning usually once a week and were still hanging out in the friend group together. Still a great friendship, I can't complain.

**Part 2:** We live very close to each other. She and her roommate were going to be out of town, so they asked me to watch over their cats. Mind you, her bedroom and hallway does not have a floor. There was some water damage and it all had to be removed. During the time they were gone, her bed was dissembled and moved out of her bedroom so her uncle could put in a new floor. I watched over the course of 2 weeks as the flooring got done VERY slowly. 4 days before she gets back and her bedroom hadn't even been set-up to be STARTED. Another thing to note, she had a huge test a week after she got back, and it really did not look like she was gonna have her bedroom or bed for the duration leading up to the test, which would suck a lot to sleep on the couch when you have one of the most important tests in your life soon. 3 days before she gets back, I actually run into her uncle getting there at 9pm to work on the flooring. We chat a bit and I learn this guy is stressed. He has never put flooring down before, and he really only has 2-3 hours every evening to work on it. I felt for him as he was given a pretty rotten deal by my friend's dad asking for things that you would need to hire a professional to do custom work for, or even things that were straight up impossible, but boy was he trying. I had a lot of empathy for him, so I asked if he wanted a hand as I have put flooring in as I used to work with my dad who remodels home and I had the next couple days off. He said sure, and to keep it brief, I spent about 25 hours putting in the flooring. I did the majority of the work while the uncle was at his actual job, and we manged to have her flooring done the night before she got home, so she able to have her bed and bedroom in time for the test. She found out from her uncle and she was extremely grateful, and it seemed to me we started talking more again. This was not a romantic gesture, but I had the means to help a friend, so I did.

**Part 3:** We started hanging out more, and I was driving her to school almost daily (she doesn't drive, but she is learning) to help her maximize time for studying. And she seems to maybe be flirty??? I couldn't tell if it was that or just her usual self that likes dirty jokes. I was also baking her bread so she could have a nice treat during her study time. It was all a bit confusing because she was acting more and more like she was when we were in the FWB situation, and I was really not sure what her intentions were. I was planning to talk to her about everything after she passed her test, as I wanted to focus my time supporting her during her study time and not stress her out with such a heavy conversation. Because if she wasn't flirting, I wanted to put up some more respectful boundaries in what she was saying to me, as they were sexual in nature, and to better maintain a platonic friendship. So, that was the game plan, but then...

**Part 4:** She failed her test and has to retake it in 3 monthes. I decided to move the discussion time to after then to best support her emotionally, as she was, and is, VERY torn up about failing and is stressed about passing during her second, and last chance. Yes, it's been stressful for me to wait on the conversation, but I care a lot about her, and would be remiss to force the conversation now instead of helping her during this rough time. To try to cheer her up, she has been coming over 2-4 times a week my place, where I've been making her dinner, making her her favorite teas, occasionaly baking her cookies (her favourite dessert), and we play videogames together for about 4-5 hours. It's come to the point that it seems almost expected that she is coming over unless one of us are busy, whereas she will talk about what we should be doing the next evening without me even asking if she wanted to come over the next day. Occasionally when we sit down we are right next to eachother, touching, but not always. She has continued to make dirty jokes, but now a good portion of them involve me doing things to her, which I am unsure how to feel about given if they are just jokes or what, but they aren't perhaps the most approporiate in a platonic friendship. We share food a lot, and have taken turns passing a cookie to each other. Also one of her favorite things to do is try to annoy me, so she is constantly trying to get under my skin. I know that is considered flirting for some people, but ya, idk. I pick her up in the mornings quite often for work and making and bringing her her favorite latte (I used to be a barista). Oh ya, I have also started making and packing her lunch for the week. She is trying to lose a little weight, so I make really delicious meals that are around 400-500 calories and she pays me to do so. 

**Closing:** So I guess this is all to say, do I just have the most comfortable and platonic friendship with this person ever, or is this like psuedo-dating??? Ya, I can just ask, and I will, but I am genuinely afraid that it would result in me not being able to support her during one of the most stressful times of her life. Regardless of any romantic desires I have, I really just care about her platonically as a friend. I genuinely treasure our friendship and have so much fun with her. I am worried having the conversation and changing the friendship, because I love having her as part of my life, but I am also in mental torment not understanding what is going on. Like trouble sleeping and eating levels of mental torment.

So here are my questions: Am I being a fool? She can't possibly know this is not the average friendship, correct? How do I best maintain the friendship through all this?

**tl;dr-** **Me and my friend spend almost all our free time together and I pack her lunches, make her dinner, and play videogames with her. I am unsure where we stand, and the stress is something terrible.** 

And if she somehow finds this and reads it, yes I am this stressed, and yes I am hiding it from you very well because I don't want to fuck everything up. ",1,1755926995.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Have you ever seen those wild ads like **“Get paid instantly to click captchas! Make thousands just solving puzzles on your phone!”** It sounds like a fever dream, right? But I actually downloaded one out of **confused curiosity** and all I can say is: **I’M SHOOK.**

Here’s what happened:

- You click on the supposed money-making “app testing” link.  
- You spend... I kid you not… hours clicking captchas.  
- *Every five clicks,* screen flashes of “Congratulations, $1 earned!”  
- Zero clue how to *actually* get your cash out.  
- And worst of all: Hidden behind those “gateway” screens? More apps. More captchas. More “deposits.”  

The rabbit hole? EVEN DEEPER than you think.

Then I found, of all things, some portals like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** promising *test rewards* for “app testing gateways.” You know I clicked. I NEEDED to see what the hype was.

Guys, honesty hour:

- The interface is slick. Looks like a legit QA test thing.
- They’ve gamified the experience so much that you FEEL productive — like you’re actually helping launch apps.
- But how does the payout actually work?  
- I scrolled the FAQ FIVE times. Zero clear answers about *real* instant cash-outs.

What blew my mind is how many people are in there, discussing hacks and sharing referral codes. I even spotted a Discord for **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** where users treat it like the next crypto gold mine. 

Recent shockers I noticed:

- You solve 100 captchas and realize you’re getting points, not money, unless you reach some astronomical payout threshold.
- Sometimes the “gateways” push *other* offers — download an app here, watch a video there — everything to eat up MORE of your time.

So, real talk. Here’s what no influencer ever says out loud:

1. For most users, actual payouts are TINY — even after endless clicking.
2. Data collected from you (and your habits) is usually worth WAY more to the company than what they pay users.
3. Some legit testing gigs exist, but “get paid per captcha” is NOT that easy cash rainbow.

*And still… I weirdly want to try again.*

Curiosity (and hope for *actual* easy cash) is a hard thing to kill. So yeah… if you want to see the madness first-hand for yourself, here’s that infamous test app link: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Try it. Just. Be. Prepared.

And let me know, please: Has ANYONE here actually gotten more than coffee money out of these “gateways”? What’s your wildest experience with a captcha app/test platform?

Or am I just another fool out here, wasting my thumb strength for *free*?

Was your journey through the **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** portal as weird as mine, or are the real winners hiding somewhere I can’t see??",1,1755926932.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False
1mxt1bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAddiction/comments/1mxt1bz/big_win_today_sharing_hope/,Big Win Today - sharing hope!!,"Short version: Today, a shitty thing happened, and I easily dealt with my feelings about it without even wanting to use food to numb them! If I can do it, you can too!

I used to have a food addiction as bad as any. I'd have weeks on end where I'd eat nothing but chips and ice cream for days, interspersed with pizza and fish'n'chips.

I still remember being down on my knees, totally beat. Gut stuffed and feeling so mush shame and self-loathing over the binge I had just had. That was about 2 years ago. Desperate, I tried OA, but ultimately it wasn't a good fit. Just contemplating Step 9 basically sent me back into a binge spiral, along with my sponsor subtly shaming my food choices when I finally relented and sent her a food log for a week. EDA was more gentle, but really didn't have the tools I needed to build my emotional capacity and nervous system regulation.

Since then, I've mostly use polyvagal tools (to get and keep myself grounded and settled) and focusing-based parts work (to sort out what's really going on beneath my cravings). I combined this gradually with new food choices, starting with addition of more fruits & veggies, whole grains, legumes; while repeatedly trying to cut out my worst binge foods - often to no avail, but with periods of success.

This year, I finally got to a point where internally I felt pretty good emotionally - no longer using junk food for emotional coping; but I was still caught in the biochemical dependency caused by ultra processed foods (so eating junk for meals, and habitually in front of the TV). I thought I was going to need a month or two in a controlled environment, and had been researching Ayurvedic cleanses and meditation retreats with the ulterior motive of just locking myself away from junk food.

But a few weeks ago, my best friend came to visit with her two kids, and we went on a little road trip. She normally eats pretty healthy, and she knows about my struggles, so she was happy to support me by not buying chips or cheeze-its for the kids. I had ice cream once, found it too stimulating, and declined it the second time they had it.

Lo and behold, those ten days were all I needed to break through the barrier. For the last month, I've easily avoided chips and ice cream, while allowing the occasional desert when I'm out with people. I choose not to bring those foods into my house because then I eat them compulsively until they're gone; but I seem to do ok having a small slice of cake or a home baked cookie once a week when I'm out.

My big win today was that I had this huge snafu with my car - clipped a curb and punctured the sidewall, and because my car has a rare tire size, only Toyota had them in stock. They wouldn't sell me just one, so I needed to shell out for 4 new tires even though only 1 needed replacing.

When I got there, the guy asked how I was, and I was like ""really? I mean, pretty shitty, to be honest..."" And he said ""oh yeah, that's fair. Do you want some ice cream?"" And without even contemplating it, I said no, because I didn't need to eat my feelings.

When the paperwork was done, he said I could grab a coffee from the fancy machine, and wait in the lobby. I went up to the machine fully planning to have a creamy, sugary coffee. But when I got there, I saw a filtered water dispenser and realised I actually *wanted* water more than coffee. 

When the car was done and I was picking up my groceries, I had an ""echo"" of going down the frozen meals aisle and buying the cheap frozen pizzas, but I instantly felt how much that was not in alignment... it took a tiny bit of discipline, but mostly it was just a ""no, thank you, that never ends well"" kind of wise knowing.

Lastly, as I was waiting for the ferry to go home (I live on an island, and I was in town), the last habit echo popped up of a slice of pizza at the place near the ferry terminal, but I still had my leftover bento box from the sushi place I had been on my way to when the tire got its flat. I enjoyed that (in my car, which I usually have a rule against, but c'mon cut me *some* slack - *it was a day!*)

I think this is the first time since getting into food recovery that I've gone through such a major upset, and not only didn't eat over my feelings, but didn't even *feel like* eating to cope.

I dealt with the practical stuff by phone, and then got in my car and cried my face off before the tow truck came (I used to stuff my feelings with food instead of feeling them; I've never been a big cryer). I let myself fully feel what a shitty deal it was, how lonely I felt to be by myself in a parking lot, and how much I just wanted to go home.

Letting my feelings out allowed them to fully process right then and there, so by the time I got to Toyota, I genuinely didn't need any emotional crutches. I just stayed feeling kinda bummed and annoyed and frustrated about the whole thing.",3,1755926917.0,FoodAddiction,0,1.0,False
1mxt121,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_VirtUsPlatform/comments/1mxt121/where_does_the_money_in_crypto_actually_come_from/,Where Does the Money in Crypto Actually Come From?,"Let’s figure out where the money in cryptocurrency actually comes from. Many market participants still don’t understand how money enters crypto: why do some people make money while others lose it? Where does the money come from at all? It can’t just appear out of thin air… Although — in reality, it actually can. And that’s a very accurate observation. If we go back to the topic I raised in the first post: crypto — like any financial market — is a “player versus player” game. There’s no such thing as everyone making money. At best, one person profits — because someone else must lose. A simple example is poker. Four players sit at the table, each puts in $100. In the end, one of them wins and takes the entire pot — the money of the other three.

In other words, this is a zero-sum game: if someone made money — it means someone else lost it. Cryptocurrency works exactly the same way. Moreover, this is the very same logic that applies to the traditional financial system — the stock market, equity markets, and so on. If someone profits, someone else must incur a loss. Money doesn’t just get printed out of nowhere. There’s no such thing as everyone profiting at once. Let me remind you about the flow of money: it always moves from the bottom to the top. Meaning, over the long term, it’s typically the big players at the top who profit — they take money from those at the bottom. Of course, there are times when retail investors can make money — in fact, nearly anyone can profit for a while. But that only happens over short timeframes, to give people the illusion of control — the belief that they’re doing everything right, playing by their own rules, that they’ve somehow “cracked the system.” But eventually, the market takes it all back. The money flows right back to the top, to the dominant players. That’s the hierarchy of the current financial system we live in. And it works exactly the same way in traditional finance.

Yes, in the traditional financial system it’s the same — the only difference is that the “pyramid” is structured a bit differently. But private investors are always at the bottom. Here’s another important idea: the market is a mechanism for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. This phrase, if I’m not mistaken, was said by Warren Buffett — and it’s absolutely accurate. What does it mean? Money “flows” from those who want to get rich quickly and easily to those who are willing to invest for the long term, build capital over time, and patiently wait. This is one of the fundamental laws of all financial markets. And this is exactly how large players make money — by selling “easy” ways to get rich quickly to the majority of retail investors. Do you think big exchanges, investment funds, or crypto projects aren’t spending on marketing to paint a beautiful — but false — picture for people? Of course they are. They create the illusion that it’s easy to make big money in crypto. What are they promoting? Meme coins, “promising” altcoins, new launchpads, hyped-up projects — and they market all of it as “accessible to everyone.”

Arbitrage, “signal” groups, financial pyramids — all of it targets one simple thing: the human desire to get rich quickly and easily. And what does that lead to? It means that money ultimately flows to those who are patient, who play the long game. That’s why I’ll repeat again: the market can be broadly divided into two categories — speculators and investors. Speculators want to get rich fast. Investors want to get rich forever. And here’s a crucial idea: you shouldn’t aim to get rich quickly — you should aim to get rich permanently, steadily, step by step, growing your capital throughout your life. If you do that, the money of most retail investors — who are almost all speculators — will naturally flow into your pocket. And you won’t even have to do anything special to make it happen. That’s how simple the pattern is.

And the majority of retail investors — they’re speculators. Their money naturally flows into the pockets of more patient market participants. You don’t even need to do anything for that to happen. The entire mechanism is simple: those who want quick profits willingly give their money to those aiming to build lasting wealth — long-term investors. Maybe you’re thinking, “I’m smarter than the rest. I’ll outsmart the system, make some quick gains, and exit the market.” There are people like that. Maybe you are one of them. But if you’re playing crypto by someone else’s rules — it won’t work. Those fairy tales about making 10x, 20x, 50x — they’re traps. Getting rich instantly, easily, without effort — that’s a myth, promoted by those who profit from your greed and your losses. It’s like poker — but on a massive table. Millions are playing. And each one wants to take money from the other.

Imagine a game of poker — not with five or six people, but with 150 million players, each trying to outplay the others and take their money. You have to understand: every player has their own motivation, and everyone is here to make money. If you play by someone else’s rules, you’ll end up losing your money to those who play by their own. So let’s get back to the main question: where does the money in crypto actually come from? Why do some people profit while others lose? Why does market capitalization grow? Let’s say Alex earned $1,000 working at a factory. His first move is to buy Ethereum with the entire amount — based on a friend’s advice who swears that “you can make serious money in crypto.” Alex buys the ETH. But then the price drops — because on any financial market, assets can fall in value, and this can happen for countless reasons: global news, shifts in sentiment, anything. Alex panics, can’t handle the drop, and sells his Ethereum for $500 — losing half of what he invested. Why? Because he wanted to get rich quickly and easily. It didn’t work. The market went down, and Alex decided it was all a scam, concluded that you can’t make money “doing nothing,” called crypto a fraud, and went back to his factory job. But here’s the key point: what actually happened? Alex left $500 of real money in the crypto market. That money didn’t disappear. It simply got redistributed among other market participants.

As a result, Alex left $500 in the crypto market — $500 of real money he earned working at the factory. He brought it into crypto, bought Ethereum, and then, frightened by the price drop, sold it at a loss. But that $500 didn’t just vanish — it was simply redistributed to other market participants. So Alex lost money, and someone else profited. Who exactly profited from Alex? First — the centralized exchange (like Binance or Bybit), which took commissions: for the deposit (for example, if Alex topped up his balance using a bank card), for buying Ethereum (usually 0.1–0.2% of the transaction amount), and for selling Ethereum (same story). All of that is pure revenue for the exchange. A small cut from each step — but in total, it adds up to a solid profit. And even if Alex left the market, the exchange still made money off him — without losing anything itself.

Next — the influencer. Or maybe it was just a friend who told Alex, “You can make some serious money in crypto!” He gave Alex his referral link — Alex registered through it, bought Ethereum — and the influencer received a cut of the trading fees. Why? Because the exchange shares a portion of its profits with those who bring in new clients. And as we already know, the exchange makes money on fees. That’s why it’s highly motivated to encourage users to bring in more users — the more transactions, the higher the revenue. The next one who profited from Alex was the advertising agency. Maybe Alex saw a banner ad online, a YouTube promo, or a sponsored tweet — and decided to give crypto a try, not because of a friend, but because of that marketing. The agency that ran the ad got paid — whether by the exchange, the project, or the influencer — it doesn’t matter. The agency still made money. Bottom line: even though Alex left crypto with a loss, along the way he fed the exchange, the influencer, and the advertising agency.

It’s possible that the exchange itself paid for the ad — for example, a banner placed on some website. That’s also part of the marketing budget aimed at attracting new participants like Alex. Other market participants who sold Ethereum to Alex also made a profit, because: They may have sold ETH at a higher price, And then, after the market dropped, bought it back cheaper. In the moment, this might not seem obvious, but over time, that’s exactly how it works: capital constantly flows from one participant to another. Someone earns — someone loses. Someone sells — someone buys. And the cycle repeats. Even those who sold ETH to Alex may profit later if they hold the asset long enough — days, weeks, months, or even years. That’s how the crypto market functions: capital doesn’t vanish — it’s redistributed. It moves from hand to hand, and over time, new money enters the system — when new participants bring in real fiat from outside sources like banks, salaries, businesses, and so on.

If someone comes from the outside — for example, from the traditional financial system — and brings real money into the crypto market, it leads to capital inflow and an increase in market capitalization. However, the core principle remains unchanged: the flow of money always moves from the bottom up. Retail investors hand over their money to those positioned higher in the financial hierarchy. I especially like this metaphor because it perfectly illustrates my main point: money always flows from the impatient to the patient. On a daily chart, there may be high volatility — the market can rise or fall sharply, and everything might seem unpredictable or even frightening. But when we look at a longer timeframe — years or even decades — it becomes clear that short-term fluctuations lose significance. That’s exactly why, in the end, long-term investors always take money from those who can’t wait and react emotionally and impulsively to every market move.

Anyone who wants to get rich quickly and easily through any financial instrument must first understand how the market actually works. Let’s imagine a situation: over the course of a year, Bitcoin grows from $20,000 to $45,000. While it rises from $20,000 to $25,000 — someone loses money, someone profits. Then it goes from $25,000 to $30,000 — again, someone loses, someone gains. And so on at every stage, with every price movement — someone is buying at a higher price, and someone else is selling more profitably. This is a classic zero-sum game: the total amount of money in the system doesn’t increase — one participant’s loss is another participant’s gain. If one person loses $100, it means someone else has earned that $100.

Of course, we have to take into account the fees collected by major players — centralized exchanges and other participants — but overall, the total amount of money in the system does not increase. In essence, no real value is being created — it’s simply a redistribution of capital. This is the fundamental logic of how financial markets operate, and it applies even to the stock market. For example, Microsoft stock might rise from $150 to $200, then to $250, $300, and so on — but at every stage, someone is losing while someone else is profiting. No additional value is being created in that moment. There’s no mechanism generating new capital, except through the losses of other market participants. Again and again: if someone earned money, it means someone else lost it. This is what defines a zero-sum game. However, there are arguments against this view — such as inflation and the growth of the money supply. Because the amount of money in circulation is constantly increasing, the system can give the illusion of capital growth.

Yes, the amount of dollars is constantly increasing — just like euros or any other government-issued fiat currency. That’s why capital invested in stocks, crypto, or gold can indeed grow over the long term. But not because someone necessarily has to lose and capital is merely being redistributed — rather, because the economy as a whole is expanding, and the money supply is increasing. As a result, assets with limited supply tend to rise in price relative to depreciating fiat currencies. The second argument is the creation of real value. For example, stocks of companies that pay dividends. I’ll go into more detail on this a bit later. Additionally, overall economic growth also influences both the crypto market and traditional financial systems — meaning they’re not entirely zero-sum games. It’s no longer just a poker table.

For example — the company Visa. It earns money by enabling transactions via bank cards, essentially providing the infrastructure for payments. In return, it collects a fee on each transaction. These revenues generate profit, which the company can then distribute to shareholders in the form of dividends. Moreover, Visa can use its profits to buy back its own shares, further increasing their value and injecting real capital back into a closed system. In this way, Visa’s business creates additional external value, since people genuinely use its services. The same logic applies to Ethereum. Ethereum is a platform for decentralized payments and applications. People actively use the network, build their businesses and decentralized applications on it, and pay fees to use the network. These fees (in ETH) are distributed among validators who maintain the network’s security. So, just like with Visa, this generates real economic activity and creates an internal economy driven by external demand. This is no longer a pure zero-sum game.

Then, the fees paid in ETH by network users are redistributed among those who secure the network — that is, to the stakers who have locked up their Ether and participate in transaction validation. This creates yield for supporting the network. At this point, we’re looking at the inflow of new capital and the emergence of a real economic model. Unlike many speculative tokens, Ethereum has objective value — it isn’t “inflated out of thin air.” Of course, the concept of value in crypto is largely subjective. Still, broadly speaking, any financial market by its nature functions as a zero-sum game. Imagine a situation where all investors suddenly decide to exit Apple stock and sell everything at once. If there are no buyers at that moment, the stock price will crash to zero. Everyone will lose their money. This logic applies to any asset — whether it generates profit or not, whether there’s a real product or not, whether it pays dividends or doesn’t — it doesn’t matter. If panic sets in and there’s no demand, any asset — stock, token, or cryptocurrency — can collapse to zero.

As for Bitcoin — I strongly recommend reading the book The Bitcoin Standard. This book will help you understand how Bitcoin fundamentally differs from the rest of the crypto market, how it differs from the traditional financial system, from Ethereum, and from other cryptocurrencies. It explains why Bitcoin holds a unique place in our modern financial ecosystem. It’s truly a foundational work — I consider it a must-read.

Now, let’s address the question: why do people buy stocks in the first place? In reality, the reasons are few. The first — is the hope of selling them at a higher price in the future. For example, you buy a stock for $100, and later find someone willing to pay $150. You make $50 simply because someone else was willing to buy the asset for more. In other words, you exit the market with a profit — but that profit is a direct loss for the next participant who bought from you.

The ability to sell an asset at a price higher than the purchase price applies to virtually all assets — stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other instruments. It’s only because there is a buyer willing to purchase your asset that you’re able to exit the market with a profit. But that profit is someone else’s loss. For example, you bought a stock for $100, and someone else later bought it from you for $150. The $50 difference is your profit — but it comes directly out of the next participant’s pocket.

The second reason people buy stocks is the desire to receive dividends from a company’s profits. Some investors are specifically interested in passive income — they hold shares in companies that consistently pay dividends. This is a perfectly reasonable strategy for long-term investing.

And finally, the third — and most important and reasonable — reason: preserving the purchasing power of one’s money. In a world where inflation is constant and the money supply keeps growing, investing becomes a necessity. It’s a way to protect capital from devaluation. Over the long term, the economy generally grows — and both the stock market and cryptocurrencies are well suited to help preserve capital value.

Why do people buy cryptocurrency? The reasons are virtually the same as for those who invest in stocks. The first reason is the hope of selling the asset at a higher price in the future. This is a speculative approach: you buy crypto today, sell it later at a higher price, and profit from the difference. The second reason is earning yield through staking, which essentially acts as the equivalent of dividends in traditional companies. By staking, you can receive passive income while holding coins within the network. And finally, the third — and most fundamental — reason: to preserve the purchasing power of money. Given the constant inflation and the expansion of the global money supply, cryptocurrency becomes a tool for many people to protect against devaluation. As for meme coins — they clearly demonstrate the mechanics of a zero-sum game. Unlike stocks of major companies, which can justify their value through business models, revenue, or inflationary protection, meme coins lack any fundamental basis. They are pure speculation: one person’s gain is exactly equal to another person’s loss.

Such products generate real profits for the company. These profits are then distributed as dividends among shareholders. That’s why we can say that the stock market is not exactly a zero-sum game: there is intrinsic value, a business model, demand for a product, profits, and, as a result, dividend payouts. The same logic generally applies to crypto. There is Bitcoin, there is Ethereum, and there are applications built on top of Ethereum — all of which create infrastructure and a certain degree of economic value. But meme coins are a completely different story. There’s no product, no revenue, no business model. There’s only hype, headlines, news, and community buzz. The profit of one meme coin holder directly depends on how much another person has lost. If I bought a meme coin for zero dollars and sold it for five — it means someone else bought it from me for five and now risks being stuck with that asset, unable to sell it even for one.

It’s the same story as with other assets — but here, there’s no underlying value. It’s purely speculative trading. And yes, it can work, but make no mistake — it’s all just a fairy tale. A fairy tale for whom? For those who want to get rich quick and easy. And who tells these stories? The big players — the ones who launch meme coins, the ones who run exchanges and make money from trading fees. And who actually determines the price of any asset — whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, a stock, or anything else? Is it a regulator? A centralized exchange? Someone else? No. It’s much simpler. Why is Bitcoin priced at $116,000? Because someone is willing to buy it at that price, and someone is willing to sell it at that price. At that moment, supply and demand met at $116,000 — that’s how a market works. The price of any asset is determined solely by supply and demand at a given moment in time. Yes, various factors may influence supply and demand — but the price itself is purely the result of how supply and demand balance among all participants at that specific point. Why, for example, did the token VIV or BCOIN on the Solana blockchain rise from 50 cents to $4.50? Because during that period, demand far exceeded supply. There was a flood of news, hype, paid advertising — and people were so eager to buy VIV that demand vastly outstripped the available token supply. That’s why the price surged to $4.50. This doesn’t mean there’s a solid technology behind VIV, nor does it mean that any asset needs a real product behind it. The only thing that drives price in the moment is supply and demand.

Here’s the translation: The next interesting question — who actually creates cryptocurrencies? Who launches meme coins, altcoins, and other projects? In reality, anyone can do it. Just like in the real world: any person can start a business — open a coffee shop, launch a movie theater, create a car-sharing service, or start a restaurant. These are just businesses built on top of the existing financial system. But in the traditional economy, you actually have to produce something, provide a service, create real value. In crypto, that’s not always necessary. It’s often enough just to promise a “cool technology” — and people are already ready to buy your token. Or you don’t even have to promise anything at all — just launch a meme coin. In short, anyone can create a cryptocurrency today. And that’s not necessarily an advantage — it’s simply a characteristic of the industry.

On the stock market, not every company’s shares are allowed to be listed on major exchanges or centralized trading platforms — there is a strict filtering process. But in crypto, everything is different: there are decentralized exchanges, and that is a fundamental distinction. Now let’s take a look at a typical lifecycle of a crypto project (or rather, 99% of crypto projects):

1.         A project idea emerges.

2.         A team is assembled to build and launch the project.

3.         Fundraising begins. This can include investments from venture capital funds or direct token sales to retail — meaning regular private investors. The project sells tokens that cost almost nothing to create, in exchange for USDT, USDC, ETH, or any other crypto asset that has real value.

4.         The token is then listed on major centralized exchanges.

5.         Finally, comes the exit: the team may start dumping their tokens at the peak of hype.

In this way, the project completes its full “cycle”: from idea to profit extraction. This scenario doesn’t apply to honest, fundamental projects — but this is exactly how 99% of outright scammy projects in crypto work.

Such scam projects are found literally at every step. That’s why the crypto space looks exactly like this. Why bother building a real business that generates actual profit, has a working product, and provides real value to people? That’s hard. It takes time. It requires effort and critical thinking. Why go through all that if you can just come up with a “project idea” — without creating a working business, without a product, without any revenue at all? Remember the movie The Wolf of Wall Street? There was a similar scheme — naive people were sold shares in supposedly “promising” companies that were allegedly about to do something revolutionary and amazing. The same exact model is working today — just in crypto. And it’s happening here and now. But the most important question you should always ask yourself is this: What are the major players really interested in? Or more accurately — not just the major ones. What motivates the creators of meme coins, altcoins, and any other crypto projects? What is their core interest? And does that list of interests include: “Helping you make money”?

Sometimes I’ll even add a bit of protein powder or flax seed to it. Now I’m wondering if I should switch to different protein powders such as plant based or casein powder? 

What was your experience with trying different protein powders? What are your recommendations? I’ve also quit coffee and caffeine in the mornings now too. Sometimes mornings I do change up breakfast to like greek yogurt, cottage etc to change it up etc. 

Now I asked AI and learning that whey protein can cause increased glucose protein from the liver and increase insulin release ..

Whey protein 
	•	Glucose → higher, sharper spike right after drinking.
	•	Insulin → big, fast surge (very insulinogenic).
	•	Good for muscle building, but can stress beta cells in prediabetes.

Casein protein 
	•	Glucose → very mild rise, flatter curve.
	•	Insulin → moderate, slow release.
	•	Better for steady glucose control, esp. at breakfast or bedtime.

Plant protein 
	•	Glucose → modest rise, slightly more than casein but much less than whey.
	•	Insulin → modest response.
	•	Often easier on glucose than whey, especially when blended with fiber.

Between serving customers, managing operations, and trying to get the word out, time is your most precious resource. What if I told you there's a way to reclaim some of those lost hours using a simple AI workflow?

Let's tackle a common time-sink: **brainstorming and drafting social media content.** Instead of staring at a blank screen for hours, here’s how you can use AI to get started in minutes:

1. **Delegate the Idea Generation:** Tell a **Text AI** like ChatGPT or Google Gemini about your business and your target audience. For example: ""I run a small, independent café. We specialize in artisanal coffee and fresh pastries. Our target audience is local residents and commuters."" Then give it this prompt:*""Act as the social media manager for my café. Your task is to brainstorm 5 engaging social media post ideas for the next week that would appeal to our target audience. Include ideas for showcasing our coffee, pastries, and community involvement. Suggest relevant hashtags.""*
2. **Delegate the Drafting:** Once you have some great ideas, pick one and have the AI draft the actual social media post:*""Using the idea for a post about our new almond croissant, draft a short, engaging Facebook post (under 100 words) that includes a mouth-watering description, mentions our sourcing, and encourages locals to visit. Include relevant hashtags like #ArtisanalCoffee #SupportLocal #FreshPastries.""*

This isn't about replacing your personal touch; it's about giving you a powerful starting point and freeing up valuable time you can spend on other crucial aspects of your business.

If you're a small business owner tired of feeling overwhelmed and looking for practical ways to leverage AI to save time and boost your presence, I'm putting together a course that breaks it all down into simple, actionable steps.

You know that sinking feeling when someone asks what you want to do with your life and your mind goes completely blank? That overwhelming sense of being stuck at a crossroads with no clear signposts? Here's the truth: **feeling lost isn't a personal failure, it's a universal human experience**. Even the most successful people you admire don't have it all figured out. The solution isn't finding perfect clarity about your entire future but learning the art of wayfinding.

Think about it like being lost in a forest. You're disoriented for three reasons: you don't know where you want to go, you're unclear about where you currently are, and you have no idea what path connects point A to point B. Most of us get paralyzed trying to solve all three problems at once, but there's a better approach.

The secret lies in understanding that life direction isn't about having a detailed roadmap. It's about developing your internal compass. Christopher Columbus didn't know exactly what he'd find when he sailed west, but he knew his general direction and kept adjusting course. That's wayfinding, and it's infinitely more practical than waiting for divine clarity about your life's purpose.

**Start with service, not success.** This might sound counterintuitive, but meaning comes from contribution, not achievement. Imagine yourself 20 years from now giving a TED talk. What would move your audience to tears? It doesn't have to be curing cancer or solving world hunger. Maybe you'd talk about being an exceptional parent, building stronger communities, or teaching kids to love learning.

Here's where most people get stuck: **fear masquerads as practicality**. You tell yourself you're being realistic when you're actually being scared. Try this thought experiment: What would you attempt if you knew you couldn't fail? Maybe you'd start that podcast, open a bookstore, or learn to paint. Now flip it: What would you do even if you knew you'd fail? This second question reveals what you love for the process itself, not just the outcome. If you'd still write that novel knowing it might never sell, writing might be calling to you.

Your ideal Tuesday is more revealing than your ideal job title. Instead of asking what career you want, imagine your perfect ordinary day a year from now. When do you wake up? Who are you with? What fills your afternoon? Are you collaborating with others or working alone? This isn't about fantasy but about understanding your authentic preferences. When I did this exercise, I realized I wanted mornings for deep work, afternoons for collaboration, and evenings completely work-free. That insight shaped major decisions about my career structure.

Look at the people you genuinely admire, not the ones you think you should admire. **You can't read the label from inside the bottle**, but you can easily spot qualities in others that resonate with your values. Maybe you admire your neighbor's ability to stay calm under pressure, your college professor's genuine curiosity about everything, or your friend's courage to change careers at 40. These attractions aren't random; they're clues about who you want to become.

Here's a powerful exercise that might feel morbid but works: write your own obituary. Not the depressing parts, but how you'd want to be remembered. What would people say about how you treated them? What contribution would they mention? This isn't about ego; it's about identifying what truly matters to you beyond daily distractions.

The beautiful thing about wayfinding is that **you can always change direction**. This isn't about committing to one path forever; it's about choosing a direction that feels authentic right now. Your values will evolve, your circumstances will change, and your dreams will shift. That's not a bug; it's a feature.

>

Stop waiting for perfect clarity. Start with imperfect action. Pick one exercise from this essay and actually do it. Write it down, don't just think about it. You can't solve complex problems entirely in your head, and figuring out your life direction is definitely complex.

Your life is waiting for you to stop overthinking and start wayfinding. The path reveals itself as you walk it, but first, you have to take that first step. What direction feels right for you today?

1mxsv6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1mxsv6i/how_do_we_help_each_other/,How Do We Help Each Other?,"Hey everyone,

 I've been spending a lot of time reading through our shared stories on this subreddit. I keep seeing the same theme over and over: so many of us feel trapped, hopeless, and powerless in our situations. It feels like the biggest chain holding us back is often economic. We can't leave because we're dependent.

I was wondering... what if we could find a way to help each other solve that problem? What if we could work together to build our own economic support system? I know it's a huge idea, but I had a few thoughts on what it could look like, and I wanted to share them to see what you all think.

I see it as having a few main parts:

1. Skills & Career Development (The Foundation)

This is the long-term solution. We need to give each other the tools to become financially independent.

 \* Skill-Sharing: What if we had a private space, like a Discord server, where we could teach each other things? I see people here with skills in coding, graphic design, writing, languages. We could trade skills, run free workshops for each other, and collaborate on projects to build our portfolios.

 \* Mentorship: We could connect those of us who are established in our careers with those who are just starting out. Imagine getting CV help or interview practice from someone who truly understands your situation.

 \* Remote Jobs: We could create a hub or a list of remote-friendly jobs from tolerant, international companies. This would be a lifeline for those of us who need to earn money from abroad while still living at home.

2. Entrepreneurship & Business (Our Own Economy)

Instead of just working for others, we could create our own opportunities.

 \* A Freelance Network: A trusted, private version of Upwork where we can hire each other. Need a website built? Hire someone from the community. This keeps resources circulating between people who understand and trust each other.

 \* Import/Export: This was an idea I had personally. I'm in Indonesia, have some knowledge in international business, and I know I could source amazing local products like crafts or coffee. Someone in Middle East, Europe, or North America could find buyers (it doesn't have to be big, even some small purchases matter). We could create a platform to connect members in different countries to build small businesses together.

\* Business Matchmaking: I have some ideas for starting a business, but finding a team or people to give you advice & you can trust is the hardest part. What if we had a private space to post our business ideas, and others with skills in management, programming, marketing, etc., could join us (especially for people in the same area/country)? We could build our own business from a foundation of trust.

3. Direct Support (The Safety Net)

For those in immediate crisis.

 \* Emergency Crowdfunding: For urgent situations, like needing money for a deposit on an apartment after being disowned. We could have a system where a few trusted members can verify a case is legitimate, so we can all donate with confidence.

 \* A Micro-Loan Cooperative: We could all contribute to a central fund to provide small, low-interest loans for members to start a small business, buy a laptop for freelance work, or pay for a crucial training course.

The Most Important Thing: Security & Trust

I know the biggest challenge for any of this is safety. A network like this would be a target. The foundation would have to be:

 \* Strict Vetting: A serious process to make sure new members are genuine.

 \* Anonymity: The ability to use secure pseudonyms to protect ourselves.

 \* Secure Platforms: Using encrypted communication.



This is a massive, ambitious vision, I know. It's moving from ""how do I save myself?"" to ""how do we save each other?"" But every great community started with an idea.

What do you all think? Is this crazy, or is there something here?

It’s about 800 sq ft with an open floor plan, lots of natural light, and a great central location near The Stork Club, Koreana Plaza, Crown Coffee, etc.

Right now it’s set up as a licensed tattoo studio (fits 4 stations + waiting area). Could be perfect for another tattoo/piercing shop, PMU, esthetics, massage, or other wellness/self-care services. It was a hot yoga studio before I took it over, so it’s pretty versatile.

Rent is $2,250/month, utilities included.
Available September 1.

Bonus: the tattoo facility license could potentially be transferred to the right fit, which means low start-up costs if you’re a tattooer looking to open a shop. I’ll also be selling some of the furniture and equipment if that’s useful.

If you or someone you know is looking for affordable commercial space in Oakland, feel free to DM me and I can share photos and connect you with the property manager.

We just did the online check in and got boarding group 16, is this bad? If boarding time says 12:30, should we be there 20min before to go through security? We decided to book a hotel near the port the day before embarkation so just wondering if we should then just grab a big breakfast (I find English breakfast quite big for the morning) or if we should just grab a yogurt and then eat in the ship lunch, will it be already too chaotic when we board?

Also wondering about the wine package, we are trying to figure out if it is worth bringing our own bottles of wine or is better taking the wine package, being that opening your own bottle in the restaurant is 29 USD, drinking our bottles in the restaurant will cost us 116USD (4 bottles) (and I assume extra 18%? thy charge on top?), wondering prices of bottles in the ship and if there is a better deal to then just bring the bottle ourselves? If we decide to use the cork service will then be store for us to drink on the next day or they will charge us every night 29 USD? I ask this because we are not heavy drinkers so we enjoy 1-2 glasses of wine while we have dinner but for sure it will not be finish each night. Maybe better per glass?

Equally (and I swear we are not alcoholics hahaha), we booked the champagne tasting for the first day (thought to do this to celebrate our first ever cruise), but notice it says its at 3PM but the departure is at 3:45PM, I assume before departure will be the security drill and at 3:45 then I assume is the sail away party show, so is it stupid we do the tasting at 3PM because we will miss the show spot?

Paid coffee vs free coffee. As per my understanding there is free filter coffee in cabanas but if we feel like cappuccino it will be paid. I am wondering about the coffee quality in the ship, is it good? For the paid coffee do they offer vegetable milks without Gluten?

About hot water, is there a way to get hot water? I assume there are not kettles in the rooms, so if I would like to get hot water for tea or a hot water bag (for stomach pain), how can I get it?

Is the Photo package in a Europe Cruise worth it? I ask this because for example in WDW the photo pass is incredible but in DLP is useless (like do not recommend it to anyone for the price they charge, there is really little pictures taken in DLP). Will a European cruise have a lot of photos like I read on the American ones or will be less?

Is using a Stanley cup allow to fill it with water from cabanas / pool bar?

Any recommendations about port adventures (if you have done this cruise before), is Vigo worth seeing or better go to Santiago? Or better do it from La Coruna?

If I bring my popcorn bucket, can I refill it in the cruise or do I need to buy pop corn for the regular price rather than the refill price (asking this because also in DLP there is not refillable popcorn -.-)

My partner and I are great together. We are in sync, have great chemistry and love being together. I do everything I can to show him love ; I compliment him multiple times daily, do what I can to help take stress off him, engage in meaningful physical touch (both sexual and not) , all the things. I never want him to question if I love him. However, it does not feel reciprocated. I am anxiously attached and I know this about myself. I feel every much at ease when I heard words of affirmation. I love it all though, getting little gifts (like a drink from the gas station), help with my car, taking me out to dinner, anything. I recently made it really clear how I would love to get a note from him. He had yet to follow through with that. 
I know he loves me. But I don’t want him to get lazy now that we have been together for “a while” especially after we just got engaged last month. I was really hoping he would have had a speech when he proposed but he said he didn’t know people did that. 
I try to give him the benefit of the doubt because although he has the kids 50/50, he does All the doc appointments, after school stuff and Everything by himself. He also has adhd and will think things but fail to follow through. I always ask him to take pictures of me, candid or not. I’ve always asked this of him and I have maybe 4 pictures after 3 years. He says he’s not good at remembering but when he took his teen to coffee, he was snapping pictures of her. Why can’t he do that for me? 
When we first stated dating I told him I was hesitant to be with someone with girls because I’ll never be the most important girl in his life. He assured me there was space for me and that I was a different kind of important. I have yet to see that come to fruition. I don’t want to tell myself he will finally focus on me once the girls move out because that’s in a decade. 
IMO, I am the perfect package. I’m stunning, funny and so loving. Every man sees this but it feels like I’ve been taken for granted. How do I get him to want to show me love ? Is it even possible??

1mxskqp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxskqp,"Built a Stock Screener Where the ""Cream Rises to the Top"" - Quality Companies Literally Float Up [OC]","Been working on different approaches to make stock screening more effortless and intuitive. After trying various things, landed on something unique - a stock screener where high-quality companies literally rise to the top in real-time as you adjust criteria. The effect mirrors how real markets work, but you can watch it happen.

**The ""cream rises"" effect**

Companies start scattered, but as you tighten quality filters, the best performers naturally float upward while weaker companies sink. Set a minimum profitability threshold and watch profitable companies bubble up. Add debt constraints and see overleveraged firms sink. Combine multiple criteria and only the true quality companies rise to the top.

**What makes this unique**

Most financial visualizations are static snapshots. This shows the filtering process as fluid animation - you're watching the market separate wheat from chaff as standards get more demanding.

Bubble physics creates natural clustering. Companies with similar metrics group together as they rise or fall, creating visual quality layers. Market cap determines bubble size, so you can see if big companies are rising or if smaller gems are floating up.

The screener offers two modes: a simple quality-based approach using business health pillars, and an advanced mode with 40+ financial ratios.

Also, there is a table view, which allows you to see more information about each ticker (sector, price, 52-week range, etc), and you can click a link to get detailed research info about the company.

**The satisfying part**

There's something mesmerizing about watching hundreds of companies sort themselves in real-time. Crank up quality requirements and watch mediocre performers get filtered out while survivors cluster at the top. It's like premium coffee sorting - adjust criteria and watch specialty-grade companies separate from commodity stocks.

Background color bands shift from red (poor) to green (excellent), so quality companies literally float in the green zone.

**Technical magic**

This required serious D3 force simulation tweaking. Bubbles respond to both metric values AND filtering animations simultaneously. The challenge was making 100+ animated bubbles perform smoothly with real-time data updates.

**Why this works**

Traditional scatter plots show where companies are. This shows how they move when market standards change - the difference between a photograph and a movie of market dynamics.

The rising cream metaphor mirrors real markets. Quality companies do rise over time, while poor performers get filtered out by demanding criteria.

**Feedback welcome**

This is part of a broader financial platform, currently in beta and looking for input on what works vs what just looks cool. Does watching companies physically rise and fall help with analysis, or would you rather see final filtered results?

1mxsk7c,https://i.redd.it/5peltozcbpkf1.jpeg,Thai Iced Tiki,"Been workshopping a recreation of the amazing Thai Iced Tiki from Bootlegger in Palm Springs.

The menu lists: Thai Tea Infused Smith & Cross, Macadamia Nut Liqueur, Vanilla Liqueur, Coconut Cream, Evaporated Milk, Honey, Nutmeg

For my recipe, I settled on the following:
2 oz Thai tea infused Smith & Cross
0.5 oz Trader Vic’s macadamia nut liqueur
0.5 oz vanilla liqueur (I used Licor 43 for a bit more complexity)
1 oz coconut cream
1 oz evaporated milk
0.75 oz 2:1 honey syrup
Grated nutmeg

Shake with crushed or pebble ice. Pour into glass and top with additional ice. Grate fresh nutmeg to finish.

For the infused Smith & Cross, I used 4 hefty tablespoons of ChaTrueMue loose leaf Thai tea infused into 8 oz of Smith & Cross. Combined in a jar and let sit for 15 minutes before straining through a coffee filter. Just an FYI, you’ll loose a bit of rum from infusing and straining, so adjust ratios if you’re making for multiple drinks.

This is definitely a boozy drink, and needs that honey syrup and cream to help balance everything out. Still a work in progress but I think I got pretty damn close. Let me know if you try it out!",40,1755925276.0,Tiki,3,1.0,False

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

First off, I wanna start by saying that I was not taught how to cook or clean or do any basic adult things by my single mom growing up. She also never hugged me nor did she tell me she loves me. I only got my affection from my dad. I struggled with not knowing how to properly name my emotions and what to even do about them because as a child I was dismissed and confined to my room. Crying was hated as if it were the worst possible thing you could do. That, and whining. And there was physical abuse. So then when my boyfriend at the time started sounding a little too much like my mom; dismissive, cold, bullying, I crashed out. That was my PMDD cycle. I notice I'm sensitive, I get nervous because I know that I'll immediately start crying if someone raises their voice at me, and then my nervousness got taken personally and then I mess up something because I'm ruminating or overthinking and then exactly what I was afraid of happens and then the SI come in. My mom kept acting like she suspected my (ex) boyfriend of being abusive but never actually *did* anything to extend herself in aid. Never. She had the chance to come upstairs and say hello and maybe have a cup of coffee but she acted like she didn't know she could. And that was the only time my mother ever came near my home with my ex and his brother, nor when it was just my ex and I living together. And then I realized.... this woman admitted to almost abandoning me as a baby and my teenage sister had to convince her not to leave me. That woman is my real mother, not this imposter. And it just keeps feeling like she's bitter that she could never deal with how bad the appearance of being a deadbeat mother would be, so instead she decided to get religious and holier-than-thou and put on the ""sister act"" while secretly praying on my downfall. I had a home I loved with those two men. I chose to be with them over being at home time and time again. Even through covid quarantine, I chose their company and laughter. They were the ones who taught me cooking basics and how to argue and how to change oil and finances and basically showered me with knowledge, music, memes, video games, and food in return for using my gas to see them. And she hated that shit for whatever fucking reason. I wasn't hurting anyone by going where I was wanted. But instead of speaking to me like, idk, an adult parent? She keeps all of her bitterness inside which keeps giving her health issues but not only that, she does a shit job of covering how much she never fucking liked me! Envious that I had two working men who showed up for me over and over with a roof over my head and space to be myself. I'm so enraged at the fact that I actually thought she changed from the kind of parent she was when I was a kid!

Let’s have a heart-to-heart for a second. Have you ever thought about what it feels like to see your hard-earned cash slowly drift away because you didn’t keep up with the times? Well, buckle up because if you’re not upskilling right now, that might just become your reality. 😱

Here's the deal: **AI is taking over** everything—writing, design, you name it. And if you're sitting still, you're missing out big time! I mean, just think about how many jobs have transformed or vanished in just the last couple of years. It’s wild! 

So, what should you be doing instead of scrolling through cat memes (no judgment, I love them too)? **UPSKILL NOW**! 🚀 

Here are some reasons why you shouldn’t wait:

- **The AI Wave is Here**: Ever seen those little AI tools making content or automating tasks? They're like super-sleek robots that don’t need coffee breaks! Embrace them and learn how to work alongside them.
  
- **Stay Relevant**: Remember the days when a basic understanding of social media was enough? Yeah, no more! Now it’s all about leveraging AI to level-up your game. 

- **Fighting inflation, one skill at a time**: Inflation is no joke, and prices are soaring. By arming yourself with new skills, you're basically giving yourself a financial armor. 💰 

- **Expand Your Network**: Upskilling opens doors. You meet new people, share ideas, and maybe even find your next collaborator or mentor. 

- **Have Some Fun**: Learning doesn’t have to feel like a chore! There are loads of resources out there, including this cool program I stumbled upon 👉 [Imagine AI Education](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). They make it super engaging and easy to absorb; it's like the Netflix of learning!

Just picture it: You dive into a course, meet new people who are just as passionate, and before you know it, you’ve acquired a new skill that not only makes you more marketable but also feels like a win!

So, what's holding you back? Are you worried about the time commitment, or are you overwhelmed by the options? Perhaps you think you’re too old to start learning something new? Nonsense! 

**Remember**: It's never too late to learn, and the sooner you start, the less you’ll be worrying about those AI $$$ disappearing. Let’s talk about how you plan on upskilling! Do you have any resources that you’ve tried, or are you looking for recommendations? 

No one wants to get left in the dust as the world speeds up—let’s level up together! 🚀💪",1,1755923095.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I initially dismissed it thinking that it just figured it out from the search history.
However, I soon noticed something strange. One time in a casual talk with my mom, She mentioned how she was looking for a new coffee dispenser since the current one have problems. Then a few mins later when she went to check on her phone, there were advertisements for coffee dispensers everywhere. Keep in mind that she had previously not searched up anything about coffee dispensers, not even coffee.
This was not the only case. Anything she or I verbally say about wanting to get something new, especially if repeated multiple times, it finds its way onto the shopping for you page. Clothes, shoes, food, everything.
I get that phones are obviously very capable of this, as siri exists. (responding to any ""Hey siri"" even when phones closed)

I feel like I should accept it because these opportunities don’t always come around but have a number of concerns. Insights from anyone who has been in the same / similar position would be great. 

I’m single and in my mid 30s and have lived in the city centre for years. I love it here as I’ve easy access to everything (things to do; meeting friends ad hoc some evenings with minimal planning; walking distance to everything like gyms and coffee shops etc.  I have always wanted to live here but now it seems less and less affordable. 

The top end of my budget is €470k all in (after getting a mortgage exemption) and I would like at least a 2-bed. Despite what’s listed on daft within this budget - the reality is that most are going for way more. 

So my options really are:

(1) wait it out and continue saving to afford more expensive properties in the city centre. 

Pros: location as close to city and Laois (home home) / buzz / easy to rent a room in initial years

Cons: Would require the max mortgage I can get (which would be 45% monthly income) - so riskier if anything happens the housing market. Property prices continue to grow at the rate I’m saving. Likely second hand properties - the issues that come with that. 

(2) go with Shankill with the option of potentially moving to the city centre in years to come 

Pros: affordable and step on the ladder / well connected to the city with 24 hour bus and dart / really high quality standard apartments

Cons: commute 3 days a week to cc could get exhausting; sleepy town with less of a buzz; possibly more difficult to rent a room in the initial years; more isolated as a gay guy; 50% social housing in the development; etc

Would love advice from anyone.

I (26F) met a guy (23M) at my flight school a few weeks ago. Let’s call him O. 

Here’s how it started: I went for a flight and apparently he saw me around the school. I wasn’t really paying attention to him at the time, but a couple days later he looked me up in the school directory, found my number, and texted me. He introduced himself, said we go to the same school, and asked if I’d want to study together.

Since then, we’ve met up a few times to study at a coffee shop, I visited his family business, and he backseated my flight. He comes off as shy but he’s been flirtatious complimented my freckles and eyes, called me pretty, joked about calling my mom his suegra (mother in law), and we’ve even had hour-long phone calls. In person, he’s very sweet and gentleman-like. For context, we both live alone.

We’re also both preparing for our checkrides in a couple weeks, so school and flying and studying have been a big focus.

Today I turned the convo a little more direct and was vulnerable. I said I should be “studying him,” when he asked what I was studying for our exam and I said I should be studying him and he said “hehe you think so?” I replied “mmhm, life’s too short not to have fun ...maybe you’ll learn something.” He said “haha I’m sure I will, but I feel like we should get to know each other a lil more.” I replied “outside of the planes,” and he said “yes I agree, more than planes for sure.”

After that, I didn’t reply. I just heart-reacted his message and left it. For me, it felt like instead of leaning into the flirt, he slowed things down with “we should get to know each other more.” It wasn’t rejection exactly, but it didn’t match my energy and kind of turned me off.

Now I’m not sure what to make of him. On one hand, he went out of his way to get my number, has been consistent about wanting to study/hang out basically anything for flying. On the other hand, I can’t tell if he’s genuinely interested in me as a person, or if it’s just convenient since we’re both at the same school.

So my question is: do you think O is actually interested but just being cautious/guarded, or is he keeping things surface-level and not really into me? Should I take his hesitation as just someone not for me , or give it time since we’re both focused on checkride prep right now?

7 Days Rwanda Itinerary for Solo Adventurers

Day 1 – Arrival in Kigali: The Beating Heart

Morning/afternoon: Arrival at Kigali International Airport. Warm welcome, check-in at your chosen guesthouse or boutique hotel.

Afternoon: Explore Kigali—visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial (a moving yet grounding experience), then wander the vibrant Nyamirambo neighborhood for street art, craft shops, and lively cafés.

Evening: Dinner at Heaven Restaurant or Pili-Pili rooftop for sunset views.





Day 2 – Kigali to Volcanoes National Park: Gateway to Giants

Morning: Road trip north through Rwanda’s green hills to Musanze. The journey itself is a rolling poem of banana groves and villages.

Afternoon: Visit the Iby’Iwacu Cultural Village, where locals share traditions, dances, and stories.

Evening: Overnight in a lodge near Volcanoes National Park, listening to the forest breathe.





Day 3 – Gorilla Trekking (or Golden Monkeys): The Spirit of the Mountains

Morning: Embark on a gorilla trekking experience (if budget allows—permit required), or alternatively, track the playful golden monkeys.

Afternoon: Return for a hot lunch and rest. Optional visit to Musanze caves or a light hike to twin lakes Burera & Ruhondo.

Evening: Share stories with fellow travelers around a campfire.





Day 4 – Lake Kivu: The Peaceful Waters

Morning: Drive to Gisenyi, the shores of Lake Kivu.

Afternoon: Relax at the beach, take a boat ride to Napoleon Island (home of fruit bats) or Peace Island.

Evening: Sunset kayaking, then a peaceful overnight in Gisenyi.





Day 5 – Nyungwe Forest: Canopy of Wonders

Morning: Early departure to Nyungwe National Park (long but scenic drive along Lake Kivu’s shoreline).

Afternoon: Hike the Canopy Walkway—sway above ancient trees, monkeys chattering below.

Evening: Stay in a lodge or guesthouse near Nyungwe, embraced by mist and forest songs.





Day 6 – Waterfalls & Coffee Aroma

Morning: Guided hike to Isumo Waterfall, hidden deep within Nyungwe’s folds.

Afternoon: Visit a coffee plantation tour in Cyangugu—learn the art of Rwandan coffee from bean to cup.

Evening: Return to Kigali (or overnight halfway depending on pace).





Day 7 – Kigali: The Farewell Circle

Morning: Leisurely breakfast, shop for souvenirs at Caplaki Craft Village or Kimironko Market.

Afternoon: Kigali city bike ride or art gallery visit (Inema Arts Center, Ivuka).

Evening: Departure flight, carrying Rwanda’s landscapes in your heart.





✨ Why this plan fits a solo adventurer:

It balances soulful solitude (trekking, lake sunsets, forest whispers) with social sparks (cultural village, local markets, shared tours).

Every day is a fresh rhythm—mountains, waters, forests, and city life.

Safety and easy logistics: Rwanda is one of Africa’s safest, most welcoming havens for solo explorers.
