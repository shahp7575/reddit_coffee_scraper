I met Jesus in a dream, I'm not even religious","I also had an interim dream (has anyone ever experienced something like that?), where I was reborn in the year 3333. In this dream, some random individual told me I once said I would be reborn in 5034 in 2025.

It wasn't quite like something you'd see in *Futurama*, though I wish it had been. So, picture this: I went to the future. **Yeah, you’re already thinking I’m losing it, but just wait.** I have a son, apparently. **But here’s the thing—I don’t even have a son in real life.** Like, if I had a son, I’d probably be getting invites to the *“Parenting 101: How to Survive Your Child’s Teenage Years”* seminar, but nope, not here. So this kid shows up in my dream, like, “Hey, I’m your son, and I’m about to take you on a mind-bending trip through time. Buckle up, mom!” And I’m like, *“Well, if I’m going to get on a cosmic roller coaster, might as well do it in my pajamas.”*

We time travel, and boom—he tells me I’m the Virgin Mary. And I’m like, *“Wait, me? Really? I can’t even find my car keys half the time. You sure you got the right person?”* But no, apparently, *I* am *now* the Virgin Mary because I died for a second in my sleep. Just a quick, impromptu vacation to the afterlife. *“Oh, I’m dead for 30 seconds, no biggie—just checking out eternity while I wait for my coffee to finish brewing.”* And then, bam—I come back to life like I just hit *“undo”* on the universe. Like, who knew “resurrection” came with a snooze button?

But here’s where it gets *wild.* My “son” looks at me all serious, and says, *“We’ve actually met before. Remember that time you tried to commit suicide in 2023?”* And I’m like, *“Wait—what? Hold up, am I being punked? Was I secretly in a spiritual infomercial and missed the casting call?”* He then drops the bombshell: *“Yeah, I was Jesus back then.”* And I’m over here like, *“Wait, hold on! JESUS? Like, the guy with the beard and sandals? Is this some cosmic prank where I’m the spiritual guest star on ‘Jesus: The Reality Show’?”*

Then, things get even crazier. He says, *“Let me show you heaven. It’s real, but not like you think. Heaven’s not this place you go after you die. Heaven is just... a better future. Continuously.”* And I’m like, *“Wait, so heaven is just the future? But like, an awesome future that keeps getting better? So it’s like, ‘Heaven 2.0’? Am I about to get some heavenly software updates?”* And then he drops the truth bomb: *“Longevity, the way we understand it now, would drive us insane. If we lived forever with the way we see the world, we’d lose our minds. So heaven exists in the future. But it’s always unattainable for us in the present.”*

I’m sitting there, absorbing all this, and then he says, *“Children are blessings from heaven because they’re the sign of the future. They’re the future coming into existence right now. They are heaven incarnate because they carry that potential for a better tomorrow.”* And I’m over here like, *“So I don’t have to give up my daughter for adoption to be spiritual, right? Because I’m really committed to this whole ‘love her so hard it could light up the sun’ thing.”*

But then, it gets even more mind-blowing. He says, *“To not have children, though? That’s also a heavenly situation. Not everyone needs to have kids to get closer to God. The concept of karma? It’s not entirely complete. We’re all still trying to figure it out. Honestly, we’re all still a bit like moronic savages who don’t really get the full picture yet.”* And I’m just sitting there, thinking, *“Did Jesus just call humanity a bunch of clueless savages? Is this some weird cosmic roast session?”*

Then comes the cherry on top: *“We’re not anywhere near divinity yet. It’ll take us a few more centuries to evolve into it. Right now, we’re kind of all stuck in a version of hell—because we think that we’re the chosen ones for heaven in this egotistical way. But in reality, we all go to heaven and hell at the same time.”* And I’m just like, *“Hold up. Wait a minute. What did you just say? Heaven and hell at the same time? Is this like a spiritual dual-purchase deal? Am I getting a two-for-one offer on cosmic destinies?”*

Then, he goes on, *“It’s a complex concept that most people aren’t ready for yet. The social system we have right now isn’t prepared for it. But don’t worry—there is hope. It will evolve, and we’ll be ready for it in the future.”*

I’m just sitting there, completely overwhelmed. *“Wait, so the future is heaven, but not like I thought it was? And the whole ‘chosen one’ thing is just an ego trip? And we’re all still kind of in a spiritual holding pattern because we think we’re all that? Wait, are you saying that, like, the world’s not ready for us to know the full truth yet? This sounds like the plot of every mind-bending movie I’ve ever seen.”*

But, you know what? I feel oddly comforted by all this. Because, really, if Jesus himself (who is also my daughter, by the way) just told me that we’re all in this crazy mess of confusion and growth together, then maybe it’s okay to *not have it all figured out* right now. I’m not even religious. In fact, I’m pretty sure the closest I’ve come to spirituality is binge-watching *The Good Place* on Netflix. But somehow, this whole cosmic wisdom thing feels a lot like getting a big hug from the universe and realizing, *“Okay, maybe we’re not all as messed up as we thought. But we’re still a work in progress.”*

Break from dream... because all good dreams are kinda broken up and weird and they come in splurges and aren't all linear, here's another splurt from that dream:

“You know, humanity’s not ready yet, but one day… you’ll get it. You’ll understand the universe. You’ll understand heaven. And spoiler alert: Heaven’s not some floating gated community in the sky with a dress code and harp soundtrack. Heaven is the future.”

And I’m just sitting there, in cosmic confusion, like, “Wait, what? I thought heaven was clouds and golden retrievers and my grandma giving me soup forever.” And he—my daughter-son-Jesus-dream-guide—just nods like I’ve asked the most adorable question in the universe.

He goes, “Yeah, no. Cute idea, but nope. Heaven’s not a destination. It’s not a one-way trip on a holy escalator. It’s the future. Heaven is where humanity’s *trying* to go, if y’all could just stop being so obsessed with NFTs and Twitter arguments.”

He explains that heaven is about the *evolution* of humanity. Like, spiritual puberty. But longer. He says, “It’s a future where longevity becomes possible—not immortality like vampires or those billionaires trying to upload their brains to USB drives—but something natural. Just a few more decades. Enough time to *grow wise without losing your damn minds.* But before that? You’ve gotta evolve. You’ve gotta stop tripping over the same rock labeled ‘Greed’ over and over like it’s a Mario Kart banana peel.”

And I’m like, “Wait wait wait. So longevity isn’t about living forever and becoming a demigod—it’s about staying alive long enough to *not be a jerk* anymore?” And Jesus laughs like I just told the punchline of the cosmic joke. “Exactly. You live longer so you can finally understand each other. So you can *outgrow* the stuff that’s keeping you in spiritual detention.”

Then he leans in like he’s about to whisper the meaning of life, and says, “The biggest plague on humanity? Greed. Greed is the emotional equivalent of trying to fill a bathtub with a spaghetti strainer. It keeps you busy, but you’re not going anywhere.”

He says the Bible wasn’t a divine to-do list—it was a metaphor, a love letter from the past. A guidebook written by people trying really hard to make sense of the human mess. “Sin,” he says, “was never about *being bad.* It was about being stuck. Fear, envy, selfishness—that stuff's like humanity's baby teeth. You’re supposed to outgrow it.”

At this point, I’m sitting cross-legged in some interdimensional IKEA lounge, trying to absorb it all. “So… you’re saying the Bible’s just a metaphor for personal and collective growth?” And he’s like, “YES. You don’t *become* Jesus or God, you just start to *understand* them. And understanding? That’s the key. That’s the next evolution of your species. Not flying cars. *Compassion.*”

Then I, in all my logic-loving glory, ask, “But… why are you telling me this? I’m not even religious! I barely go to brunch, let alone church!” And he laughs again—like big, belly-shaking, dad-joke energy. “Exactly! You’re not special. I tell *everyone.* Every single day. From the moment you wake up—which starts at conception—to the moment you go lights out. I’ve been whispering this through your art, your science, your weird existential memes. But y’all are so busy worrying about being ‘chosen’ you forget: the message isn’t exclusive. *It’s collective.*”

And then things got *weirdly tender*. He talks about how the whole “life and death” thing, conception and termination, isn’t this dramatic black-and-white fight like people make it. It’s not about controversy—it’s about *comprehension*. Understanding our biology, our pain, our interconnectedness. It’s about recognizing what we need to overcome *as a species*—not just as individuals on a moral leaderboard.

He says, “Judgment is the biggest distraction. Y’all are stuck comparing who has it worse, who’s more righteous, who deserves what. But evolution? Doesn’t play favorites. You either grow together or not at all. That’s why rehabilitation matters. That’s why compassion matters. That’s why *science and spirituality* aren’t enemies—they’re dance partners. The Bible was just your first awkward prom. It’s time to learn some new moves.”

I’m sitting there, basically cosmically baked on wisdom, going, “So… you’re saying sin is just the word we made up for growing pains? And judgment is like… blocking the WiFi to our collective soul?”

And he—*still my daughter somehow*—just smiles, all cheeky and radiant and vaguely sarcastic like she knows I’m going to turn this into a stand-up routine later. “Exactly. Keep evolving. Keep letting go of the stuff that keeps you small. And stop acting like love is scarce. There’s more than enough.”

And then, with the biggest grin in the cosmos, she adds, “Oh, and by the way, you’re the funniest, weirdest, most chaotic little human I’ve met in a while. I mean, seriously—dream time travel? Emotional theology? Mixing metaphors like a salad spinner? Iconic. Keep going. You’re on the right track.”

1kcoju2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dream/comments/1kcoju2/part_1_met_jesus_in_a_dream_im_not_even_religious/,"Part 1. Met Jesus in a dream, I'm not even religious.","I had this fascinating dream the other night that’s been lingering in my mind ever since. In it, my son—now all grown up—had invented this extraordinary personalized 3D printing module. It was more than just futuristic; it felt like something that could genuinely shift the world as we know it. The idea was that families, in the near future, would be able to produce essential items directly in their homes. The initial cost of the module was steep—around $137,000 per household—but it was made possible by a collective investment of $487,359,000 from forward-thinking individuals and visionaries who believed in decentralizing production.

What struck me most was the dream’s sense of clarity and moral urgency. This wasn’t just a new gadget—it was a reimagination of how families engage with the economy. Instead of being dependent on giant corporations for basic needs, families could become self-reliant, crafting items tailored to their specific needs while significantly reducing consumer waste. It was a radical shift from passive consumption to creative production.

The dream carried this vision of a world where families no longer depended on massive retailers for everyday products. Instead, they could just print what they needed—people customizing and creating items specifically for their homes, all while minimizing waste. It felt like a complete shift in how families could approach consumption.

Clothes could be redesigned from old materials, reshaped to fit changing seasons or growing children.

What struck me the most was how this invention could reshape everything we know about capitalism and consumer behavior. The thought of families having the power to print their own necessities was both exhilarating and a little daunting. There was this sense that if everyone could do it, we might move towards a more sustainable and self-sufficient lifestyle. My son, in the dream, spoke with this calm confidence about how this invention would not only change households but also disrupt the very foundation of consumer capitalism. He believed families would become centers of innovation again—places where making things with your hands and imagination would be more valuable than purchasing something disposable. This felt deeply personal, like a return to the values many of us yearn for: sustainability, creativity, and interdependence within families and communities.

He even showed how the technology would integrate with environmental efforts. Waste management, he said, would become circular. Anything purchased—shoes, clothing, plastic containers—could be broken down and repurposed indefinitely. The module would sort, melt, and recompose materials without harmful emissions. Microplastics, one of our biggest threats to ocean and soil health, could be all but eliminated. The idea that a family’s waste could stay within their own ecosystem and be continually reimagined into something new was almost poetic. It was heartwarming, picturing them engaged in the creative process, learning the value of making things rather than just buying them off a shelf.

The financial investment initially seemed enormous. But in the dream, people began crowdfunding, forming neighborhood cooperatives, and working with ethical engineers to bring down the costs. My son emphasized that the shift wasn’t just technological—it was cultural. People were tired of false promises from politicians about ""bringing back jobs"" or ""helping working families."" This invention *was* the answer: putting tools back in the hands of the people, literally.

I envisioned my grandchildren growing up in a world where every home was a little workshop of creativity and resilience. Where learning how to recycle meant *remaking* something from what you already had. Where economic stability didn’t depend on employment at a massive company, but on the ingenuity of families and communities working together.

There were, of course, challenges. Questions about digital security, equity, and access arose in the dream. But the tone was one of possibility, not fear. We could train kids in design thinking, sustainability, and digital craftsmanship as core curriculum. Libraries could become local hubs where families shared materials, downloaded designs, and contributed to a global open-source community of makers.

And maybe, just maybe, if the billionaires out there wanted to do something meaningful—something truly transformative—they could invest in *this.* Not another app, not another space race, but a future where families are empowered, self-sustaining, and creatively free. This dream felt like a solution that bypassed bureaucracy and handed back dignity, agency, and innovation to everyday people. It was a dream of beauty, practicality, and justice.

In his explanation, my son described a revolutionary transformation in waste management—one that would completely redefine our relationship with consumption, ownership, and production. In this future he envisioned, anything we purchase—clothes, shoes, furniture, packaging—would no longer be seen as single-use or disposable. These materials would instead become permanent assets within our households, reimagined and repurposed through a personalized 3D printing module. A worn-out shoe could be scanned, reshaped, and repaired at home. A cracked water bottle wouldn’t be trash—it would be material for your next gardening tool, a toy, or even filament for a piece of custom furniture.

Polyester, a synthetic fabric often demonized for its environmental impact, was at the center of this evolution. My son explained how polyester—essentially a form of plastic—could be ground down and used as a bonding agent within the printer. In his words, “What we throw away today becomes tomorrow’s raw material.” The machine itself would adapt to multiple techniques in one system—extrusion, sintering, fused deposition modeling—all integrated to accept a wide variety of input materials. That meant you wouldn’t need separate devices for wood composites, plastics, or textiles. Just one module and a little knowledge.

And even the need for ink—traditionally a recurring cost and source of waste—would evolve. He predicted that within 50 to 100 years, we’d no longer rely on external ink cartridges at all. Instead, colorants, binders, and adhesives would be extracted directly from the materials being recycled. A red polyester shirt could not only become part of a new item, but also provide pigmentation. Discarded packaging wouldn’t just disappear—it would live again as both substance and style. The idea that what you consume could regenerate itself, becoming a permanent part of your home ecosystem, was both exhilarating and deeply restorative.

This vision went far beyond technical convenience—it represented a fundamental shift in how society functioned. We would no longer be passive consumers but active creators. People wouldn’t buy things just to possess them—they’d exchange ideas, designs, blueprints. Communities would collaborate, sharing custom solutions for local needs. Instead of tossing a broken chair, families would rebuild it using open-source schematics tailored to their unique preferences. If a plastic switch broke in your kitchen, the printer would scan the piece, recreate it to the millimeter, and install it with ease—no need for replacements, shipping delays, or landfill waste.

But perhaps most moving was how this shift redefined the value of memory. With fewer goods being mass-produced and discarded, culture pivoted toward preservation. Antiques, heirlooms, handcrafted tools—these weren’t just relics anymore. They were honored. Cared for. Restored. Historians, curators, and archivists—long seen as fringe or academic—became crucial voices in shaping our collective continuity. The past was no longer a dusty museum; it was a living part of our homes, a design reference for what came next.

This wasn’t just a technological revolution—it was a social one. The grip of exploitative labor markets began to loosen. As households became self-reliant, the global demand for cheap, disposable goods declined. Families didn’t need to support industries built on hardship anymore. Instead, the workforce shifted toward ethics-centered roles in environmental restoration, emotional care, education, innovation, and community support. Work became something tied to dignity and imagination, not just survival.

My son and his college friends spearheaded this change. Their vision was practical, emotional, and holistic. They didn’t just engineer a machine—they reengineered hope. They marked the end of the industrial cycle of overproduction and waste and ushered in a new era defined by regenerative living. A world where what we had was enough—because we could always reshape it. A world where design was democratic, shared freely, and inspired by the needs and spirit of families, not corporations.

And most beautifully, it was a future where the Earth could finally breathe again. Landfills weren’t dead zones—they were seen as dormant vaults of untapped material, repositories of a civilization’s past waste now recognized as a goldmine of potential. Trash wasn’t trash anymore. It was possibility—reclaimed, reimagined, reborn.

My son had made this dream into a movement. In his vision, waste management wasn’t just a system—it became a story we all shared. He launched a campaign that started with a simple premise: *What if we could clean the entire planet—not just maintain it, but actually heal it?* His plan stretched across five decades and across borders. It invited countries not only to take responsibility for their own waste but to trade and rework the discarded materials of others. In this new model, nations didn’t export pollution—they exported potential.

At the heart of this campaign was the module: a personalized 3D printing system that could turn nearly any physical material—plastic, polyester, cotton, wood pulp—into a functional object tailored to each home. But this wasn’t just another gadget. It was a paradigm shift. Rather than buying a new phone case every six months, you simply updated the internal parts of your existing phone while the outer shell—durable, beautiful, and deeply personal—remained with you. It was like a computer tower you kept for years while swapping out the insides. Stability wasn’t sacrificed for style; design became an evolving extension of your identity.

In his design language, material ownership changed. Families would purchase “ingredient bundles” of microplastics, organic fibers, and pigments, not finished goods. From that, they could print wardrobes, cushion covers, duvet sets—personalized, seasonal, or sentimental. Clothes weren’t fast fashion anymore. They were modular, minimalistic, regenerative. Closet space became less about stockpiling and more about active curation. You didn’t just own clothes—you authored them. Old shoes weren’t throwaways—they became legacy items, sought after, reshaped, passed down, and printed again with care.

And it wasn’t just homes that benefited. The technology rolled out strategically. For the first five years, it dazzled as a novelty. “Wow” moments in tech expos, global showcases, pop-up labs where kids could print their own Pokéballs, chess pieces, or lunchboxes. But beneath the surface, it was creating new habits, new expectations. Businesses followed—first the coffee chains, then retail stores. Instead of ordering new plastic cups in bulk, companies like Starbucks printed them on-site, cutting costs, waste, and supply chains in one motion. What had been a global problem—excess manufacturing—was replaced with local solutions, crafted in real time.

Soon enough, every major city had hubs—part creative space, part recycling center, part community design lab. And from there, self-sufficient micro-economies began to sprout. The phrase *“Made in China”* or *“Made in America”* slowly faded. The new badge of pride was *“Reimagined Here.”* The old paradigm of factories and outsourced labor gave way to a generation of student innovators, local designers, and families who became stewards of their own material world.

In a surprisingly poetic twist, this revolution didn’t make belongings more disposable—it made them more meaningful. It was as if we had collectively awakened to the idea that objects were not meant to be mere placeholders in our lives, but extensions of our essence, expressions of care and intention. This shift wasn’t about diminishing the value of ownership—it was about deepening it. If you could have 365 unique designs of clothing across a year, the idea of consuming endlessly to fulfill fleeting desires began to dissolve. You no longer needed to fill your closet with an overflow of duplicates or variations of the same thing. Instead, you were empowered to have just a few pieces, each one versatile and dynamic, capable of transforming from one look to another, one purpose to another. It was the experience of owning fewer things but cherishing them more deeply.

The essence of this shift was in the concept of duration. No longer was consumerism based on the brief cycle of ""newness""—the relentless pursuit of novelty and the next best thing. Instead, it was rooted in a deep respect for time and how we spent it, how we engaged with the things around us. Objects weren’t disposable; they were meant to last, to evolve with us, to change and grow in significance over time. It was a radical departure from the throwaway culture of the past, and yet, it wasn’t about clinging to the old for the sake of nostalgia. Rather, it was about allowing items, whether clothing, furniture, or technology, to have a longer, richer life through intentional design and purposeful use.

Housing design mirrored this transformation. Urban homes, once sprawling, compartmentalized structures built to house endless amounts of stuff, began to evolve into smaller, simpler spaces. The focus shifted from storage to meaning. Without the need to constantly accumulate and store more things, people became more intentional about their surroundings. Homes shrank not just in size, but in complexity. The space you lived in no longer served only as a place to stow away your possessions—it became an extension of your identity, an environment curated for mindfulness and personal growth.

The aesthetics of these spaces embraced simplicity and functionality, with every item having a purpose, a story. Your home didn’t need to reflect how much you could own, but rather how well you could care for it, how thoughtfully you engaged with each item. In this world, possessions were valued for their durability, versatility, and the memories they accumulated over time. It wasn’t about accumulating more, but about developing a deeper relationship with what you had.

In this reimagined world, consumerism was no longer defined by the rapid churn of trends and the fleeting satisfaction of newness. The pace of consumption slowed, and in its place emerged a concept of duration—a lasting engagement with the world, both material and emotional. The focus shifted from how many things you could gather in a lifetime, to how well you could care for the things you chose to invest in. The revolution wasn’t about buying less—it was about investing more deeply in what truly mattered, and redefining value based on long-term relationships with our possessions, our spaces, and each other.And that was the deeper truth my son carried in this dream of his he kept saying: that technology was not just about efficiency—it was about care. For each other. For the planet. For the stories we wear, the chairs we sit in, the mugs we drink from every morning. Waste, he believed, was just a sign of imagination not yet applied.

He kept saying how his invention wasn’t just a machine. It was a framework for a new civilization—one where consumption became creation, where ownership became stewardship, and where the Earth was no longer buried under our neglect, but held up by our care.

And what astonished me most was that he had thought it all through—even involving a criminologist in his research. Together, they had explored how this shift in material life, labor, and resource management could ripple into the realm of justice. The criminologist predicted that within seventy years, the very nature of criminality and intention would begin to transform. If scarcity, desperation, and systemic neglect were no longer the fuel for survival-based crimes, and if communities were rebuilt on access, equity, and creative agency, then even the foundation of our judicial systems would need to change.

The dream imagined a world where crime prevention wasn’t just about policing behavior—it was about reimagining the conditions that created suffering in the first place. Theft might decline in a world where everyone had access to what they needed and could create or trade for what they wanted. Vandalism might fade in cities where public art, creativity, and communal design were embedded in the daily landscape. Rehabilitation would take precedence over punishment, and instead of filling prisons, society would be filling libraries, labs, maker spaces, and healing centers.

In that imagined world, the laws themselves would evolve—not just in content but in spirit. The justice system would no longer orbit around guilt and control, but around restoration, intention, and prevention. The criminologist spoke of a future where the question wasn’t “What law was broken?” but “What need went unmet—and how can we heal it?” It was radical, even poetic. And somehow, it made sense.

It made me realize that when you dream big enough—about waste, about housing, about machines and materials—you end up dreaming about people. And when you take care of people, everything changes. Even justice. Even time.

I'm not sure if this is possible, but I had a very odd dream that felt viable and plausible at the time. In the dream, the situation unfolded into a discussion about how it could change our perspective on commodities and modernity. Instead of focusing solely on affordability and the idea of just buying a model, we discussed the importance of what’s ""inside"" and how we often overlook the significance of the exterior. Additionally, we considered the value of design and customization in shaping our views.

The dream felt like a blueprint for a new world, where people no longer defined themselves by what they owned or by the superficial appearances of things. My son, in his visionary way, had worked closely with people who specialized in finance and social work to design a completely reimagined community. They envisioned a new system where resource management and wealth distribution were grounded not in scarcity or accumulation, but in collaboration and sustainability.

One of the most striking elements of his plan was how he reimagined those recycling machines—those familiar, coin-dispensing stations you find in many cities. His idea was to place these machines everywhere—in neighborhoods, schools, train stations, and even shopping centers. But the twist was that, instead of just rewarding individuals with cash or points for recycling, they would become part of a larger, interconnected system. The goal was to incentivize sustainable living and reduce waste by linking the act of recycling directly to other benefits—like reduced fares for public transportation or discounts on public services.

By making recycling a daily part of city life, people would not only feel the immediate satisfaction of contributing to a cleaner environment, but also the long-term benefits of this involvement, which might lead to improved health and well-being. These machines were no longer just a tool to manage trash—they were a key part of a thriving, circular economy where nothing went to waste. In the dream, this concept was rolling out globally, transforming cities into thriving, green spaces where people worked together to maximize the potential of everything they used, no matter how small.

Health, too, became a central focus of his vision. He spoke of a world where public health was tied to environmental responsibility, and where the very spaces we inhabited were designed not just for aesthetic value or comfort, but with the health of the planet and its people in mind. The materials used for construction—homes, offices, and schools—would all be sourced sustainably and could be endlessly repurposed. Buildings wouldn’t just be static structures; they would evolve over time, as flexible as the people who lived inside them.

In his presentation, my son explained how his idea could reshape housing prices and change conversations around environmental efforts. He suggested that his approach would not only enhance worker safety, but also restore durability in construction. By shifting the focus from the ""new"" and the ""wow"" factor to the intrinsic value of long-lasting, quality materials, he believed people could understand that investing in durable goods—whether it was a house, a car, or a pair of shoes—was a more sustainable and cost-effective approach than the constant cycle of disposability.

His plan also addressed issues like zoning and land use. No longer would decisions be made based solely on what was available; instead, they would be based on the components being purchased and the long-term impact of those decisions. He proposed a system where consumers could choose the colors and types of plastics they used in their products, making customization a key part of the process. This, in turn, would repurpose abandoned malls and other underutilized spaces into hubs of creativity and innovation, reducing the need for enormous warehouses and creating new business opportunities.

The dream had taken an even broader shape in his mind, extending to how society viewed landfills and waste. In this new world, waste wasn’t something to be avoided or hidden—it was a resource. By turning landfills into recycling centers for raw materials, we could generate industries that focused on composting organic materials, repurposing plastics, and even finding new uses for discarded electronic goods. ""Dumpster diving"" could become an essential role in resource management, and picking up trash could evolve into a legitimate job that contributed to the health of both the planet and society.

Phasing out traditional factories and factory jobs was another part of his plan. This wasn’t about eliminating work—it was about changing what work meant. With fewer people stuck in low-wage, soul-crushing jobs manufacturing goods that would only end up in the trash, society could pivot towards jobs in education, technology, design, and care. Workers would have access to better jobs that aligned with their values, as well as the resources to pursue the type of education that would allow them to thrive in this new economy. By rethinking the way we structured labor, poverty could be significantly reduced, and working conditions would become humane and fulfilling.

The transition, according to my son, wasn’t just about reducing waste. It was about creating a more humane, sustainable model of capitalism—one that respected the planet and its people. He even proposed a credit-based system for recycling, where people could receive benefits similar to an EBT card for their recycling efforts. These rewards could be used for public transportation, education, or even healthcare.

What struck me most, though, was that his vision didn’t stop there. He wasn’t just imagining a cleaner world; he was imagining a world where social structures could be reworked—where justice, health, and well-being were no longer tied to consumption or exploitation. The criminologist he had worked with predicted that, as scarcity and inequality diminished, criminality would evolve too. With fewer people resorting to crime out of necessity, the entire judicial system would shift towards a restorative model, focusing more on rehabilitation and prevention rather than punishment.

While it felt like a far-fetched dream, it was a beautiful one—full of hope, promise, and possibility. And though I struggled to find the right person or platform to share these ideas with, I could see how it might work. Maybe it was idealistic, maybe even radical, but the dream stayed with me long after I woke up.

As I reflected on all that my son had imagined, I couldn’t help but think how powerful this vision of the future was. A future not defined by the objects we own, but by the care and creativity with which we approach the world around us.

<div>### Choosing the Perfect Palette to Complement a White Couch

Designing a living room with white couch decor offers endless opportunities to create a bright, inviting atmosphere. White couches act as a neutral canvas, allowing homeowners to experiment with various color schemes. Soft pastels like blush pink, mint green, or sky blue can add a gentle pop of color without overwhelming the space. For a more dramatic look, deep navy, charcoal gray, or emerald green accents enhance the crispness of white, achieving a modern and sophisticated balance.

### Incorporating Textures and Patterns

To avoid a stark or sterile feel, layering textures is essential when styling a living room with white couch decor. Adding plush throw blankets, woven area rugs, or velvet cushions introduces warmth and tactile interest. Patterns, whether geometric or botanical, can be incorporated through accent pillows or curtains, providing visual depth and personality. This interplay of texture and pattern keeps the space lively and inviting while promoting a cozy ambiance.

### Lighting and Accessories for Enhanced Ambiance

Proper lighting is a key element when working with a living room featuring a white couch. Natural light amplifies the couch’s brightness, fostering an airy vibe. Complement this with warm-toned lamps or statement chandeliers to create layered illumination. Accessories such as metallic vases, minimalist artwork, or wooden coffee tables serve to highlight the white couch, ensuring it remains the focal point without overpowering the room.

### Maintenance Tips for Durability and Cleanliness

While white couches elevate any living room’s aesthetic, they require mindful maintenance. Using slipcovers or choosing fabrics treated for stain-resistance helps preserve the couch’s pristine appearance. Regular vacuuming and spot cleaning prevent dirt buildup, making upkeep manageable without sacrificing style.

1kcofds,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kcofds/looking_for_advice_if_this_relationship_is_worth/,Looking for advice if this relationship is worth it,"To make things short and digestible. I'm 29M - work full time, run my own business & am ""now"" in a healthy relationship. I think this is a healthy relationship but everyone I speak to says it's not so here I am to try to help gain some mental clarity

To take a step back further to understand where I'm coming from 

3 years ago I began dating a friend who I knew for 10 years. We re connected at a point in my life where I was very vulnerable and at what I would say rock bottom (covid fiasco, stuck in Canada, lost job due to business closing and being renovicted for the second time). 

Let's call her M. 

M was a very good hearted, kind and loving girl. I adored her honestly, she would be able to brighten my day so easily and effortlessly. Our relationship had tremendous highs but also tremendous lows. Unfortunately she had Un treated BPD (that she told me) and our relationship turned into an emotional rollercoaster from love bombing - limerence - devualation to the final discard on the weekend when my best friend died.

This relationship brought upon the worst depression, anxiety and PTSD I've ever experienced. I lost 50 pounds in 7 months, ive deleted my entire social media presence and I no longer do the things that used to make me happy. It's been 11 months since she left me and I'm now 3 months into therapy thru DBT, CBT & CPT.

At the beginning of this year i started to get some closure, heal and become more comfortable with myself. I went and downloaded bumble and of course went through a host of obnoxious, promiscuous and abusive women and began to give up on dating again fully until I met this girl, let's call her E.

E was different than many of the girls I've met, our first date started with a coffee date and ended up with a 3 hour drive where we just spoke about everything. We went on a few more dates and she checked off almost all of the boxes of what I want out of a relationship. We began dating a month ago and I've grown what I feel is more attached to her than she is to me. Resulting in my fears, anxiety and trauma to re surface from my past relationships when the emotional highs arnt there like I'm used to. 

Together in person everything is great, I enjoy every moment we spend together. It's just when it comes to texting is where I don't feel the connection. She is a very dry texter with no emotion shown, she doesn't really send emojis or show much emotion via text. I can send her a funny video and she would reply with lol or just not show much emotion 

Also due to me not having social media anymore, I don't have that connection to her thru there either

But the bigger issue that I'm still having is that sometimes it can go hours between our text messages. Sometimes we only say Goodmorning to each other, wish each other a good day and then our evening conversations consist of a few text messages and then her just going to bed. Sometimes I don't even get a goodnight text. 

Her friends have openly told me how she is a bad texter so I've swept this under the rug but it keeps building up on me 

I've had this conversation twice with her how these things can cause me to spiral and second guess if I'm doing something wrong or not enough. We just spoke the other day and I feel like we grew closer and she said she would actively ensure that she communicates her needs to me or is more present with me. 

But the the past two days were back to spotty texting. This can make planning days to see each other difficult and it's caused me to spiral into anxiety and fear everyday when I dont get a reply back or wait hours between replies to only get a few words said to me

I am her first boyfriend and I am the first person she ever has been with. So I understand this is all new to her but the lack of emotional intensity is causing me to spiral 

I'm not sure what to do. When we are together everything is great but the days we are apart I end up in the mental gutter and am unable to do basic tasks at home because of this fear of abandonment",1,1746146899.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I recently launched my own coffee brand called Legacy Roast — it’s built for hustlers, entrepreneurs, and anyone striving to leave their mark. The idea came from wanting more than just a caffeine fix — I wanted something that actually represents the grind and reminds you why you started.

Legacy Roast is about fueling ambition and building a legacy, one cup at a time. I’m starting small, testing different roasts, and looking to connect with like-minded people who love coffee and personal growth.

You can check it out here: legacy-roast.myshopify.com

I’d really appreciate your feedback — on anything: the name, the site, the concept, or what you’d personally want from a brand like this.

A few questions to guide the convo:
	•	What kind of coffee do you usually drink and why?
	•	What draws you to a specific coffee brand?
	•	First impressions of the name and site?
	•	Anything you’d change or add?

Thanks in advance! I’m here to build something great and your input would mean a lot.",1,1746146849.0,dropshipping,0,1.0,False
1kcoeks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1kcoeks/the_almostforever/,The Almost-Forever,"For the longest time, I assumed he hadn’t seen me. He moved through the gym like the noise didn’t reach him—silent, reserved, untouched by the room around him. I’d watch him from across the room, convincing myself I didn’t care if he noticed.

The day after 2023 Christmas, I walked up to him and said something ordinary. A question about form and routine. He answered like it was nothing, but something shifted. We spoke for maybe ten minutes. I walked away thinking that was the start.

But it wasn’t.

Weeks later, in a conversation I didn’t expect to matter, he mentioned a detail about me from months back—something small, something I thought no one had been looking. And just like that, the story rearranged itself. I had thought I’d introduced myself to him that day. But he’d already been paying attention.

He just didn’t let it show.

Things moved slowly, but deliberately. A coffee here, a drink there. He wasn’t the kind of person who overflowed. Everything about him was measured, precise. But every so often, the mask slipped. He’d say something that made the air hold still—something that suggested I was more than just a passing curiosity.
“I always noticed you at the gym. I could only imagine spending time to know you.”
“And how I’m trying to understand why we met. And what to make of it. I’m still trying to understand.”

There were moments I’d catch myself staring—drawn into those sharp, kind eyes that gave nothing away and yet somehow held everything. Sometimes I’d tell him Ocean Eyes by Billie Eilish reminded me of him. Not because his eyes were blue, but because I found myself drowning in them anyway.

I don’t know what it was about those moments. Maybe it was the way he made it feel like I had arrived exactly when I was meant to. As if I had always been written into the scene.

But there was always something unspoken between us. Like we were dancing in the dark, never quite sure who was leading. We both carried a long, messy, lived-in kind of love—the kind that lingers even when it ends. I knew about her without him telling me her name. You can always feel the ghost they haven’t laid to rest.

Still, he promised she was behind him. That it was over. That what they had was broken.
And I believed him. Or maybe I wanted to.

We never gave it a name, but our lives began folding into each other. Conversations stretched into hours. We moved through dim bars and quiet corners like we were hiding from something. He’d brush his hand against mine, play with my hair while we waited for rides, kiss me softly as we parted. I learned the shape of his silence. I memorized the rhythm of his laughter. We shared beds, and the plans. We made space. Affection, vulnerability, deep thoughts, and follow-throughs—or so I thought.

I told myself it was enough. That there was no need to rush.

Until he began to drift. Gently, almost imperceptibly. The kind of distance that pretends to be distraction. I asked him what we were—carefully, quietly, like it might break whatever we had left. And he told me he didn’t know. That the timing was strange. That he felt something, but couldn’t name it. That he was still trying to make sense of it all.

He didn’t say the words. He didn’t need to. I felt the quiet retreat of someone who had already decided they wouldn’t stay. Not because he didn’t feel something. But because he didn’t know what to do with it.

A few months later, I found out he had gone back to her.

There was no message. No explanation. Just the quiet horror of seeing them together again—the digital breadcrumb trail of a man choosing comfort over possibility. Memory over momentum. The familiar, slipping back into place like I had never existed.

And I said nothing.

Because what is there to say when someone chooses the life they once left?

Sometimes I wonder if he ever thinks of me.
Maybe I was nothing more than a pause in their rhythm. A quiet interruption in a long and unfinished love song. But sometimes, when the house is still and the night refuses to end, I wonder if he remembers. If I still flicker in the quiet corners of his mind the way he still drifts through mine—softly, without warning.

He once told me I was brave. That I carried myself with serenity, even after everything. That I had a good heart. That I moved him, in ways he hadn’t expected.

And maybe all of that was true. But still—he left.

It wasn’t a love story. Just a collision. A quiet crossing in the middle of chaos.

And now I’m the one left searching for meaning. Still trying to understand why we met. Why it wasn’t enough.

And why I wasn’t enough—for him to stay.",4,1746146830.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

Only this woman wouldn’t.  She’s 47, stunning but a bit wounded from the men she’s chosen.  I get that.  

Moved back to my city to be closer to her grown kids.  Unemployed and we got along great.  

Only she wouldn’t meet for coffee.  

“My nice clothes are still in boxes!”

Me: “put on a ball cap.  It’s fine.”

Nothing.  

Then she friends me on FB.  (As a note, I really dislike this if we have not actually gone out on a date or two.)

Finally after three days of intense pen pal, I text her that I will put my focus on someone who did meet me for coffee and we had a connection.   

Yet I also told her I was holding off to see if we would meet because I thought we might be a better fit.  

Then she melted down. 

“You were talking to other women while we texted?!?”

“I don’t want to be just another woman you’re talking to.  We just may be looking for different things… I stopped chatting with other men…”

Yet she wouldn’t make a half hour for me.  

I wrote back to explain how Bumble works.  (Yeah, mansplaining always diffuses the situation!). That she probably gets 400 likes a week and I’m lucky to get 2-3 matches a week (not likes but matches).  

Then she’s all, “well I know what I want and I deserve only the best and to be treated better than this.”

Good gravy.  

We never even met.  

I ended it, “there are also times where we don’t need to meet for coffee to know it won’t be a fit.   Best wishes!”

Outside of just validation, why be on Bumble if you won’t meet.

Mine has been surprisingly pleasant???,"I had a double US core needle biopsy on my right breast on Monday morning on 4/28. The double biopsy was a shock to me because I had assumed that I was only getting one stab in the boob, not two!

I broke down on the operation bed for so many reasons, but one of them being that I had assumed that I was going to be in so much pain for recovery now with two wounds.

But quite honestly, I have felt nearly no pain at all since then! The only thing that I had felt was a slight twinge of discomfort when I accidentally lifted my right arm all the way up to reach something, as well as almost like a poking feeling from inside my boob that happens every so often. It quickly goes away when I put an ice pack on it. But it is freaking me out over how well my boob has taken this trauma.
I still have the gauze pads over the areas of incision. There’s no blood and it’s been holding and protecting the surgical tape. 

Also no crazy bruising thus far??? The top one has some around the incision site. Though to be fair I haven’t gotten a complete full look at my bottom incision since the angle of it is right under my boob and out of my line of sight. 

I’m not sure what to make of this but hopefully give a little of relief to anyone who’s nervous about getting a biopsy.

I still have yet to receive my results, but the radiologist seemed to be bluntly saying that she most likely says it’s benign. I just don’t want to jinx myself, especially with how well this experience has already been lol.

I also want to say that I took no Tylenol for this either, only considered popping one after Day 1 because I was getting a consistent headache, probably because of the stress and my caffeine withdrawals (have been severely limiting my coffee intake since the start of this whole experience. I saw a report that the normal amount of coffee is 7-9 cups a week???? I’ve been double that 😵‍💫). I ended up thugging it out and the headache was gone the next day.

Just wanted to know what your experience has been too if you went through this route?

I’ve been living abroad for a few years now, and I quit drinking about three years ago. It was the right decision for me—I had a really unhealthy, all-or-nothing relationship with alcohol, and being sober has made a massive difference to my wellbeing.

But socially, it’s been really tough. I lost most of my drinking friends after I quit, and making new ones hasn’t been easy. I live in a country where I don’t speak the local language well, which makes it hard to connect in the first place. And to make things worse, the social culture here revolves almost entirely around bars and nightlife. When I try to suggest coffee meetups, walks, hanging in our own homes or other alcohol-free activities, people just aren’t interested.

Even my one remaining friend, who says she supports me, changes completely when she drinks. She gets pushy and tries to get me to “just have one,” and then denies it ever happened the next day. I’m starting to feel like I don’t have anyone in my corner anymore.

Has anyone else experienced this as a sober expat? How did you find ways to connect with people that didn’t revolve around drinking? I’d really appreciate any advice or solidarity—it’s feeling pretty lonely out here.",3,1746146507.0,expats,0,1.0,False

TL;DR:
I’m a stay-at-home mom to two young kids, and husband—while successful at work—neglects home responsibilities and requires constant prompting to participate in childcare and basic chores. Despite frequent arguments and promises to improve, nothing changes. I feel emotionally exhausted, feel unappreciated, and frustrated that he’s capable of being responsible at work but chooses not to be at home. I’m questioning whether it’s time to consider separation because i don’t want to live like this forever. 



when is it appropriate to consider separating due to the neglect of home responsibilities??? 

I’m honestly at my wits end with my husband and I’m sure it’s because I already know the answer. My husband (27) and I have two kids. (3m 2f) my husband also has an amazing job and I am so incredibly proud of him.

his job has taken over our entire relationship. It is the entirety of everything we talk about and if I ask him to try to talk about anything other than work, even if I try to lead the conversation in a different direction, it either always leads back to work or sometimes I have literally seen him struggle physically to not talk about work. (Insert possibly necessary eye roll here) 

when it comes to our kids, he definitely struggles with taking the initiative to know his kids need a meal, do diaper changes, and really just waits for my direction for anything. I have almost all of the time asked him to change diapers or feed them and he’s never just done it. 

we have argued mostly about the home chores not being “evenly” distributed (I say evenly like that because it’s not even, I’m a SAHM and I obviously will always do more because he is working and providing) but I’m not asking this man to get on his hands and knees ever day after work and scrub the baseboards. He is 27. He knows that his coffee and half full bag of baby bell cheese that’s been sitting on his desk for three days where he plays his video games every night probably shouldn’t be there anymore but guess what’s still sitting there as I type this?? And before anyone says anything, I have been cleaning up after this man for 8 years already. It was time for him to learn a few years ago. It’s not my job when I have two other kids I have to clean up after. 

the reason why I mentioned the problem with his job, is because I know he has the ability to clean up after himself and be responsible because if he wasn’t, he wouldn’t be doing so well. So I know he has the mental and physical capability to do it, so why won’t he do it at home??? 


dramatically, we have argued over this shit for literally the past year it seems. The same arguments over and over again always ending in “I’m sorry” and then it literally happening again days if not literal minutes later. It is so simple to look around and clean up after yourself or help your wife out with the little things she asks you to. Also, he refuses to go to any type of counseling because he’s “not going to be able to sit there and listen to someone tell me everything you’re (me) doing wrong” (like….what?????) 
 
It is just so frustrating because like I said, it is so simple and I know he’s capable because he’s willing to do it at work. So why won’t he step up and literally be an adult at home??? I really don’t want to live the rest of my life like this. ",1,1746146395.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

might as well speak a different language 
And she'll say... parts of her are missing 
Pours it out to numb the pain 
Takes it in to stop the rain

Scars within, scars without

Suit of armour protects from strife
She wishes for another goddamn life

Running from memories, running from ghosts 
Running from whatever hurts the most

1kco3y0,https://i.redd.it/159oaxrmi9ye1.jpeg,Here is How to Get from 0 to 6★ hero MLB Full Blessing + EX weapon engrave 1 and 1 locked option.,"TLDR:
- Spend the coffee like that
- Get the hammer for 5k gems once a month
- Participate on the events.
- Purchase 1 coffee daily

First of all here is the spread of how to use your coffee. Use it like that, participate in the events and watch the adds and make 1 coffee purchase for 100 gems daily. 

Now here is the breakdown:

I used over 6000 coffee to get some data:

Maxing a Hero:
1160 Evolution stones
400 Myth stones
700 Hero crystals

Evolution = 1160 evo stones
2530 coffee 
9 days using daily boost
Get 147 HC alongside.

Myth = 400 Myth stones
2670 coffee
Purchasing 1 coffee daily
10 days
Get 213 HC alongside. 

Limit break = 700 HC
360 from before
120 = 60 per event, ×2 per Month
28 = adds per day in a month
8 = mail adds = 2 per week for 4 weeks.
48 = tetis shop
8 = Beach missions 
138 = 6 Monthly pulls 23 per multi on avrg

================
Exclusive Weapon

6★ = 1000 red crystals
Max limit break = 5 hammers
Engrave 1 = 1 hammer

Event RC = 160 per month
1000-160=840 red crystals = 2520 coffee
Get 435 MM alongside.
10 days 

6 hammers = 9000 MM -:

435 from before
3000 = 2 hammers from events =
1500 = 1 Hammer for 5k gems =
280 adds 
80 from adds
580 = 4 weapon pulls
50 = Events
Gold 16 boosted and 6 regular = 3081

0.48 MM/ coffee on gold
0.1733 MM / coffee on RC.

At floor 530 of tetis I get 1500+ coins per day 
We get about 30 free books for:
- Monthly log in
- Events
- Guild assistance
So for just 20 books left you can farm 5 every week.
At 700 coins per book that takes about 3 days and the rest you use it for the other products.

Lock stones as F2p you get from:
- Medal shop (5 per week)
- Events = about 2 per week.
So in 28 days you get 28 lock stones, enough for locking 1 stat of your exclusive weapon. ",1,1746145910.0,GuardianTales,1,1.0,False

Born an Omega. Raised to breed.
Most see us as the girls who steal their mates or the ones their mates cheat on.
The truth is, we’re the ones who help populate the world when natural methods fail within mating.
Omegas should be cherished, given what we do for the world but instead we’re the lowest of the low.
It's why they toss us in breeding centres where we never see the light of day except for when we’re allowed to shift.
This life they chose for me is not the one I'm going to live.
Until the witch masked my omega scent, making me the Gamma.
I would be free when I passed the trial.
‘We can do this.' My wolf whispers as I walk around the room.
It was also then I saw Alpha Lucifer, the one who would change my life.

Chapter 1
""Eat up, Omega. It's a big day for you and you'll need your strength."" I mentally roll my eyes as Nanny shoves a bowl of oatmeal in front of me. We all call her Nanny because when we make the mistake of using her actual name, we get a switch across our backs. I've lived in a house for orphaned girls since I was eleven and today is the day I get out. Seven years in this dump and all I'm leaving with is a bag with two t-shirts, a change of panties and a slightly clean pair of jeans. It's been hell living here. There are forty-two girls living here, all between the ages of five and eighteen; we practically sleep on each other's laps; there is so little space. Nanny gets paid per girl, per day, from the local Alpha so she takes in as many of us as she can. I look up from the table to see Nanny peering down at me. She has a constant look of disgust on her face, almost like someone has smeared something nasty under her nose and she spends all day smelling it. She's an old Gamma, not suitable for mating or breeding so she gets to do whatever she wants. If you ask me, she's lucky.
""It's my birthday today; I have to go and get my marks done."" I tell her as politely as I can. I might be eighteen but if Nanny notes even a little disrespect in my tone, she won't hesitate in beating me black and blue before I leave the house.
""No point; we all know the mark you'll get. Omegas are good for one thing only; I should just send your flat ass over to the breeding centre and have it done with it."" I have to clench my hands under the table to the point my nails dig into my palms as Nanny growls down at me. I hate that she always speaks to me when I'm sitting down; it makes me feel like I'm an inch tall while she sneers down at me. Part of me can't wait to get out of here but I know what my future holds. A breeder. The second I was born and was declared an Omega, my fate was set in stone.
""I still need my marks, Nanny. It's the law."" The two girls next to me snicker but quickly stop when Nanny slaps her meaty hand down on the hardwood table.
""Fine but then you go to the breeding centre and get me my money back—a waste of decent cash for you to be marked."" I shiver as Nanny growls at me; she reaches into her stained apron and fishes out a handful of gold coins. She hates having to pay for our marks but the Alpha pays her with the intention that each girl is sent on her way and into the world with everything she requires. Nanny doesn't hand me the three gold coins; she tosses them onto the table and barks a laugh when I dive for them.
I don't bother with the oatmeal; my stomach is in knots, so I push up from the table with my coins in hand and walk from the dining room. Today is supposed to be a special day. Every girl is excited for her marks, even the Omegas. It declares our role in the world to everyone who sees our marks. The marks themselves span the entirety of our back and down onto our arms so they end just past our knuckles. The world is split into four parts: Alpha Frank runs the city, which is where I am now, and Alpha Anthony runs the breeding centres, which is where I'll go next. Alpha Lucifer runs no man's land; it's the biggest part there is to control and has smaller, less powerful Alphas dotted through the land. Alpha Ford runs the furthest Pack they control all our needs, like gas, electricity, and food—anything we need to live comes from Alpha Ford and his Gammas.
""You good?"" I push off the wall as one of the only girls I can actually tolerate walks towards me. She got her marks last month and is due to join Alpha Ford any day now. There are so many Gammas that there are limited spaces for them. Poor Sarah has had to wait for a place to open up for her; it means that after turning eighteen and getting her marks, she's had to come back to this hellhole.
""She didn't want to give me the coins for my marks."" I tell Sarah as I push my hand into the pocket of my simple cream dress to ensure the coins haven't magically vanished. Sarah raises her perfectly plucked eyebrows at me as she looks around; she's checking for Nanny before saying anything. Her chocolate-brown hair doesn't move an inch from its immaculate French braid. Gammas always look perfect; they could be doing hard labour all day, every day, and still look perfect.
""I'm sorry, Freya. I know you don't want your marks but there's no way out of it."" I bite my lip as Sarah runs a hand up and down my arm before walking off for her breakfast. She's right, of course; I don't want my marks but I have no choice. If I don't get them, then the law enforcement guards will come for me, and I'll automatically be in Alpha Anthony's bad books. The last thing I want is to be placed at the bottom of the heap at the Breed Centre.
‘Maybe they got it wrong; the old ladies might change things for us.' My wolf is always trying to keep me upbeat but she knows as well as I do that I'm an Omega and nothing is going to change the marks that get placed on me. If it wasn't for my wolf, I don't think I would have made it this far in life. When your life is a pit of depression and pain, a little uplifting voice can sometimes be good.
""I'm leaving!"" I scream into the old house. My voice echoes back at me but no one shouts back. I pluck my bag off the hook and give the empty hall one last look. The flower-patterned wallpaper is peeling and you can see marks where pictures once hung. I don't ever remember pictures being there, though.
As I pull open the heavy wooden door, I feel a lump in my throat as I turn my back on the house for the last time. As an Omega, I won't ever be back here. I'll get my marks, a tour of the breed centre and then my assignment. I should feel some kind of pain or regret from leaving the place I've lived most of my life but all I feel is a sense of unease about where I'm going next.
‘Hold your head high; we can't change who we are but we can do it with a smile on our faces.' If I could kick my wolf, I would. There's a time and place for optimism, and as I walk from the only home I remember, with nothing on my feet, it is not it.
""Shut up."" I snarl to myself as I shift my small bag over my shoulder. It's way too small, even for my small amount of belongings but it's all I have. It's too early for anyone else to be out on the streets; I'm hoping that means I'll be one of the first to receive my marks. Omega's might be a necessity for our people but we aren't looked upon nicely. Most see us as the girls who steal their mates or the ones their mates cheat on. The truth is, we're the ones who help populate the world when natural methods fail within mating. Omegas should be cherished, given what we do for the world but instead we're the lowest of the low. It's why they toss us in breeding centres where we never see the light of day except for when we're allowed to shift.
Chapter 2
<>
My hopes of being the first to the marking ceremony are dashed when the carriage pulls up. It's packed so full that from the outside I can't see a single empty seat or even a man; it looks like every girl of marking age got up and had the same idea as me. I step onto the carriage and face possibly the meanest-looking man I've ever seen. He has a scar down the entire left side of his face; his nose is at an odd angle, like it was recently broken; and his patchy skin makes him look like he has a serious drug addiction. His green eyes look more red thanks to how bloodshot they are and I don't think it's coffee in that red mug he's holding.
""Two coins."" He grunts as I dip my hand into my pocket. I go still as I look up at the carriage. I was told it's one coin to get to the marking ceremony and two coins as a thank you to the High Witch.
""I thought it was one coin."" I say softly, I can hear people speaking quietly as I hold up the carriage. No doubt they're all wondering why an Omega is trying to argue; we're supposed to be the ones looking forward to the marking and everything life hands us afterwards.
""Double for Omegas."" The man grunts as if he couldn't care less that he's ripping off a homeless girl. He can no doubt tell where I'm from; hell, the orphanage Nanny runs is just down the road; he probably passed it to get to the corner where he's picked me up.
""If I give you two coins, then I only have one for the High Witch."" I lower my voice to just below a whisper; it's bad enough not having enough coins but bartering with a carriage driver is a new low. Even for me.
""Two coins or no marking; get to it, Omega; I have shit to do."" People are staring now. I glance down the carriage to see people sticking their heads into the packed aisle as if looking for whatever the holdup is. Not wanting to cause a scene, I drop the two coins and cross my fingers that the High Witch will still mark me with only one.
""Sorry."" I mutter as the man scoops the coins towards him the second they hit his little gold tray.
""Bottom of the carriage for you."" He hisses before slamming his foot down; he starts moving the carriage before the doors are even fully closed, which sends me careening forward into a Gamma standing off to the side. From the looks of her long purple maxi dress with delicate white flowers stitched into the bottom, she's a future mate. She'll either get chosen by an Alpha or she'll go through the trials and then be left to live her life in peace.
I keep my head low as I carefully push myself past Gamma after Gamma until I'm wobbling down the steps to where the mean driver directed me. This level of the carriage is less crowded; it's also less elegant. The upstairs is all plush red chairs and gold leaf detailing along the cream walls and around the clean windows. The Omega area has no windows; it's got two lights hanging from the ceiling and the seats look really uncomfortable, almost like someone has slapped down a few planks of unpolished wood and called it a day. Three Omegas are down here already; each one looks as beaten up and downtrodden as I feel. None of them look around at me as I take a seat; I feel every bump of the road as the carriage makes the rest of its journey. I don't complain; Omegas don't do that. It's beaten into us from birth. As Omegas, we're expected to lay back and take whatever the world has given us. I've heard some people talk like they think we have the best deal out of every other female. We don't have to work, we don't have to pay rent and we never have to worry about putting a meal on the table. Everything we have and everything we are is taken care of by the breeding centres and the Alpha that runs them. I'll never understand how people can think lying in a bed getting pumped full of sperm until you're pregnant is a luxury. We don't even get to keep the babies that we eventually give birth to; they get given to Gamma families that struggle to conceive or if we give birth to an Omega, they get given to the Nannies of the world to be brought up like me. It's never a life I wanted but it's the life I've been given. Sometimes I dream about being someone else. Someone who has a say in what they do—maybe I could run a shop, sell books, or learn to bake—anything but what my destiny has set for me.
""Cheer up; we won't have to deal with these people much longer. We get shipped off as soon as we're marked."" The Omega in front of me says as she looks over her shoulder. She has dull brown hair and pale green eyes; the smattering of freckles across her nose and over her cheeks makes her look younger than she actually is. If she's on this carriage, she's the same age as me.
""And that's supposed to be something to look forward to?"" I ask her as I tuck a piece of my silver hair behind my ear. My messy bun doesn't quite keep all my hair under control; little tendrils keep falling free.
""Why not?"" She shrugs her shoulders as she looks down at her grubby dress that I'm sure was white at some point. ""We get to birth the next generation while never having to worry about anything; everyone wishes they could be like us. I'd rather be popping out a few kids than struggling to make ends meet in the city or out in no man's land, getting beaten to shit every day by some lawless male."" She's not wrong but I really hate that those are my only options. Well, I guess I don't even have options. It's not like they give Omegas a multiple-choice when it comes to what we do in the world.
I've always known I was different from other Omegas. I always wanted my hair to look nice and my body to be clean. I was never interested in the sex education lessons that I was forced to take and no matter how much Nanny tried, I could never get into the thing where I'm supposed to just sit on my ass while others wait on me.
‘We aren't different; we just don't want to do what society tells us.' My wolf grumbles at me as I lean back in my seat. There's no point in having a conversation with the Omegas; I'll never be able to see eye to eye with them. I can hear the Gammas laughing and talking above us as the carriage ride gets bumpier and bumpier. I'm jostled from side to side thanks to there being nothing to lock me into my hard wooden seat. I don't know exactly where the High Witch lives but I do know she's not here in the city.
""Anyone know how long this journey is?"" I ask as I pinch the bridge of my nose. I can feel a migraine coming from the way the lights are dancing around the darkened area.
""Long, it's near no man's land."" The Omega from earlier tells me, another looks over and nods, while the third just completely ignores me.
""No man's land; that's Alpha Lucifer, right? I thought he went into a deep sleep years ago."" I rub my eyes as I try to breathe deeply through my nose. No matter how sick I get, I know this carriage won't stop and no one will thank me if I stink up the carriage with my vomit.
""The High Witch called him forth a few months ago; it's the first time he's woken up in almost twenty years."" The Omega in front of me tells me before looking forward again. An Alpha is put to sleep by the High Witch when they don't find a mate; they then sleep until the High Witch senses his mate has come of age. That means Alpha Lucifer will be hosting the trials this year. I don't ever remember anyone talking about the marking ceremony or trails for a mate taking place so far out of the city before. Least I won't be around to see the carnage that is no man's land.
Chapter 3
<>
""Teal or red?"" I blink at the teenager standing in front of me; he's holding up two shirts like it actually matters what fucking colour I wear. I've been awake for a handful of months and I still don't feel fully with it; if it wasn't for the High Witch and her refusal to put me back to sleep, I'd be blissfully below the surface while this damn thing carried on. Instead, I have to not only be part of it but actually host it. Parts of the house that have been covered in sheets for years are now alive and full of light and warmth. Soon every inch of the house will be filled with possible mates and Omegas looking for their marks.
""Sir, you must pick."" An older man walks into the room as the dark-haired teenager shakes the shirt choices at me again.
""It's Alpha and I don't give a shit which one I wear."" I growl as I sip my whisky. It has two ice-cold stones in the bottom, giving the whisky a nice cold bite as it hits my throat before warming my empty stomach. I lean back in my chair as the older man takes the teal shirt and shoos the teenager away. The last time I was awake, I had Carl as my manservant; now I'm stuck with the man time forgot; I swear he even has grey hair. I know I'm older than dirt thanks to the years I've spent in a deep sleep but I still feel like the twenty-nine-year-old who fell asleep under the watchful eye of a High Witch all those years ago.
""My apologies; I'm out of practice, Alpha. The High Witch tells me that the women will be arriving soon; once the Omegas are marked, we will be introducing the possible mates to their guides and you will be expected to host the Alphas."" I cringe as the older man walks towards me while taking the teal shirt off the hanger and holding it open for me.
""Remind me of your name again."" I know, I'm a dick; I should really know the name of my own servant but I haven't bothered because once I know their names, they expect me to give a shit.
""Ronald, Alpha."" He tells me as I put down my half-full glass on my heavy wooden desk, the ice-cold stones clink against the glass a little before settling along with the whisky. I quickly unbutton the simple white shirt I'm wearing. I hate these things. They feel too stiff against my skin; I'd much rather be bare chested but apparently Alphas don't walk around half naked anymore.
""Right, let's get something straight; I don't speak to the other Alphas. Actually, I couldn't give two shits about them. I want this over and done with as soon as possible and then I'm going back to sleep."" I turn as I speak so Ronald can help me put on my shirt. I can do it myself but Gammas get all pissy when an Alpha tries to take a job from them and I can't be arsed with the drama right now.
""Shit, you're getting grumpier in your old age."" I spin around with the shirt only halfway up my arms. Ronald yelps as I yank it out of his hands so I can stare at the High Witch. She's standing in the doorway, a smirk on her beautiful face. She's dressed in an all-black floor-length gown; it sits high on her chest so you can't see a single hint of skin and the lace of the arm loops around her second finger to make sure the gown won't accidentally slip up. When people think of the High Witch, they assume she's old; she is, but that doesn't mean she has to show it. She's the High Witch because she's the most powerful witch in our world and too powerful for her own so she was banished here a long time ago.
""You should announce yourself before coming into my office, witch."" I growl as I shoo Ronald away; whatever Dominica has to say to me shouldn't be heard by other ears.
""And I thought we were closer than that when I put you into that second sleep,"" she laughs as she steps into the room while Ronald steps out and closes the doors behind him.
""Come and sit down."" I growl as I pick up my glass and drop myself into my desk chair. I don't offer her a drink; she won't accept anyway. Instead of sitting in the leather chair across from me, she glides over to the small, two-seater sofa and charred wood coffee table next to the floor-to-ceiling window.
""Something is coming."" I know this voice; she's had a vision, which means I'm about to hear some weirdly vague shit that probably doesn't even concern me.
""I ain't got time for it."" I tell her as I down the last of my drink and slam the glass back down on the desk. My shirt is open, showing her my Alpha marks. Unlike the women, Alphas wear their marks on the chest and arms. I've added to mine over the years but the original mark will always look more prominent. An ethereal design made up of what looks like intermingled feathers that almost look like they are dancing with each other. No matter how hard I look, the feathers never untangle. I can't see where they end or where they begin. I hated the mark when I first got it but now I've grown fond of it.

One of her big problems is downshifting, especially while engine braking and/or going uphill. The engine sounds like you're revving it HARD while braking, and the RPM shoots up. When you apply gas, it jumps forward and makes a loud VRRrr noise (not like a bonk or bubble or anything,) then cuts it out. Problem with that is that you've usually not slowed down by then. I'm pretty sure it's downshifting in general, cause it'll happen when you're braking too- just not as hard, and usually only when you're braking quickly. Barring quick downshifts, braking doesn't cause any symptoms, including when idle. 

The other possibly related problem would be her having occasional problems accelerating- similarish rev feeling and higher than normal RPMs, esp when starting/going uphill. She usually evens out fairly easily/reliably, and functions normally.

This is an upgrade from before, mind you. I changed the oil + filter, replaced the spark plugs, secured the wires (they were loose,) and the positive battery terminal T bolt (not needed, lost the first one lol) and it got WAY better. Before it was practically all the time with any speed changes, and the only speed she didn't hate maintaining was 40mph. She also had the rough idling, super loud engine, misfires, etc etc- that also got better. She still has rough idling, but much better- with the exception of the downshifting she's only really angry when I drive her without letting her warm up for 10+ min. Personality of an old grumpy grandma who needs her coffee

I haven't changed the spark plug wires + coils- super expensive (relative to plugs) and I have to refund the tools I got first- no bones to spend here. I also haven't changed (or checked) the transmission fluid- its on the list, unless somehow the fluid is squeaky clean. Her serp belt (and associated things) are fine, and the radiator doesn't seem messed up. The filter definitely needs to be cleaned/replaced, but idk how it would contribute to these problems. Any ideas on whats up?

  
I think replaced wires + coils would help a lot, considering how much better she got from changed plugs. There's nothing broken with them, and no leaks- they're just very old methinks. The other idea I have would be something with the fuel system being fucked up- it happens way more under 1/3 a tank, and she's grumpy if she's not 1/2 or more. I just used the fix finder from auto zone, it only came up with a loose/broken fuel cap- which I'll fix, she doesnt pass emissions now and I'm pretty sure thats bc I accidentally fucked the cap up- its been a little over a month since the test and theres been nothing but improvements.

I am REALLY hoping its nothing with the transmission itself. Even if i had the money to spare, it wouldn't be worth it, especially since I dont think i could repair/replace most of the related parts at all.

I'm pretty sure it's downshifting in general, cause it'll happen when you're braking too- just not as hard, and usually only when you're braking quickly. Barring quick downshifts, braking doesn't cause any symptoms, including when idle. 

The other possibly related problem would be her having occasional problems accelerating- similarish rev feeling and higher than normal RPMs, esp when starting/going uphill. She usually evens out fairly easily/reliably, and functions normally.

This is an upgrade from before, mind you. I changed the oil + filter, replaced the spark plugs, secured the wires (they were loose,) and the positive battery terminal T bolt (not needed, lost the first one lol) and it got WAY better. Before it was practically all the time with any speed changes, and the only speed she didn't hate maintaining was 40mph. She also had the rough idling, super loud engine, misfires, etc etc- that also got better. She still has rough idling, but much better- with the exception of the downshifting she's only really angry when I drive her without letting her warm up for 10+ min.

I think replaced wires + coils would help a lot, considering how much better she got from changed plugs. There's nothing broken with them, and no leaks- they're just very old methinks.

I just used the fix finder from auto zone, it only came up with a loose/broken fuel cap- which I'll fix, she doesnt pass emissions now and I'm pretty sure thats bc I accidentally broke the cap- its been a little over a month since the test and theres been nothing but improvements.

I am REALLY hoping its nothing with the transmission itself.

I’ve searched online all day to try and find places that will maybe allow me to shadow different roles on set (or even just make me get their coffee orders lol) but unfortunately they’re mostly 18+, and if it is for under 18s, it’s usually like a summer camp where you learn the skills, not gain the experience. I don’t want to sound whiny but I’m just a bit frustrated that I can’t find anything and that I might have to actually wait until I’m 18 — which is fine I guess but I’m just ready to get out there. 

Is there anyone here who’s had jobs on set/in the film industry/in a studio as a teenager that can give some advice? Or someone to give me a reality check maybe?

I fear that if the snacks arrive in bags (like they do with delivery), her visitors will think it’s for them and eat them up before she gets a chance to. 

Additional context if you care: The reason I’m even shipping her these snacks is because she has been going full days without lunch breaks at work because they are too busy to let her take lunch (don’t get me started on how angry that makes me), and then she comes home to help her visitors who came from out of state and who my mom opened her home to. I have nothing against these people. It’s just that my mom has health issues of her own and she has not been eating due to not having enough time during or after work. Sometimes she only has coffee in the morning and then a meal at like 10pm. My mom is worried about everyone else, but no one ever worries about her. And I just want to make sure she gets these snacks herself so she can stuff her purses and her desk at work. If there’s a possibility these could come in bags, I rather find another way to send her snacks.

**What is this post?**  
It’s not about healing.  
It’s about rebuilding.  

A story of what happens *after* the storm passes — and how someone like you or me starts to put their mind back together.  
Not with motivation or hacks — but with structure, attention, and a screwdriver.

---

I’m sitting in my car outside Home Depot.

Morning.  
A pack of utility blades in the bag, coffee in the cup holder.  
I showed up to finish a wallpaper job — but the key they left didn’t fit the lock.  
So I’m waiting — with time, with tension, with thoughts I didn’t plan to have.

Across the parking lot, I watch an older man, slow and calm, loading a ladder into his pickup.  
Nothing dramatic. But for some reason, it grounds me.  
Moments like this — between tasks, between thoughts — they became my anchor.

---

### Where I’m at, really.

If you’ve read my first two posts, you should know:  
they weren’t written in the middle of a breakdown.  
They were written almost four months after I emerged from one of the most destructive depressive episodes of my life.

They were emotional, yes —  
but deliberately so.  
They captured the heat after the fire.  
Not as data, but as feeling.  
And I think they did what they were meant to do.

---

Since then, it’s been four months.  
And for the first time in years —  
I haven’t let depression take the wheel.

It still visits.  
But now I notice it *before I become it*.  
And that noticing makes all the difference.

---

There’s a metaphor I use:

**Depression is a rainstorm.**

Before, I’d run out into it — unprepared, unprotected, soaked to the bone.  
Now? I stay inside.  
Make tea with lemon and honey.  
Watch it hit the windows.  
And choose not to walk into it.

---

Since that shift, I’ve gone deeper.

OpenAI replied to one of my letters.  
A real human. No template.

They didn’t offer a fix.  
They offered direction:

> “You’re already building a self-observation system.  
> Keep going.  
> Study neuroplasticity, cognitive science, behavioral psychology.”

So that’s what I’ve been doing.  
Not as a professional. As a practitioner.  
A field technician of the mind.

---

### What that looks like:

- Morning: 3 honest, unfiltered sentences in a journal  
- Evening: trigger reflection and mapping patterns with GPT  
- A mental subway map begins to form:  
  - **Stations**: emotions  
  - **Lines**: reactions  
  - **Transfers**: new habits

---

And here’s the real shift:

Recently I started sharing this with a few people.

Two of them gave genuine responses.  
They felt it. But they didn’t act — and that’s okay.

Because I realized something:

It’s not enough to tell someone what’s worked for you.  
They have to feel the impulse to start walking toward it themselves.

---

So now, I’m building that.

Not a framework for everyone.  
But a way to meet someone *where they are*,  
and show them how to take the first real step.

---

I’ve started talking with two people who are struggling.  
I’m not leading an experiment. Not yet.  
I’m just listening. Asking. Watching.  
Trying to catch the language that lands. That sticks.  
That stays with them after the scroll.

And maybe — what quietly opens a door.

---

And in the background, there’s still my hardest battle:  
**rhythm.**

Structure. Sleep. Restoration. Energy.  
I’ve lived in chaos for most of my life.  
And now I know:  
that’s not just “how I am.”  
It’s part of my bipolar phases.

---

Lately, I’ve been slipping.  
Not out of laziness — out of depletion.  
Work, jobs, mental effort, physical output — it drained me.

And I see it. I own it. I’m not ashamed.  
It’s just part of the system I’m building.

---

So I’m reinforcing the foundation:

- Real sleep  
- Real recovery  
- Real blocks of structure  
- Real-time phase awareness

You can’t research the brain from inside collapse.  
You need a platform to stand on.  
And I’m building that platform.

---

Soon, I’ll be moving to ChatGPT Team.  
For myself. My wife. My son.  
To use it not just as a chatbot —  
but as a shared interface for reflection and alignment.

It forgets sometimes.  
But it still tries.  
And I see that.  
And I care.

---

If you’ve ever felt the need to pull your own storms into words just to stay afloat — I’d love to hear your story.

**You’re not alone.  
And neither am I.**

1kcnt09,https://www.reddit.com/r/untildawn/comments/1kcnt09/i_caved_in_and_watched_until_dawn/,I caved in and watched Until Dawn,"!SPOILERS! 

I just finished watching the movie and I have some thoughts. I went in with an open mind, I knew from previous reviews from fans that this wasn't anything like the game. I'll say that as a fan of the game, I am disappointed at the loss of opportunity to have a good Until Dawn movie. The idea is good and I think the movie would have done better had it been under a different title.

But it's not, sadly. I did like the references and the design of the Wendigo. I felt they did the design justice. But what irked me was how the victims became the Wendigo. Even someone with little to no knowledge of the cryptid knows cannibalism is what causes the transformation, not what the movie shows it to be. Even the game points it out.

It was nice to see Peter Stormare return, one of my favorite parts of the game was the segments with Dr. Hill. I feel bad that having Dr. Hill in the movie didn't really add much to the character from the game. Or any depth. He's still a psychologist, but the movie presented him as one that's too into his profession. I had a thought when Clover was confronted with Dr. Hill that he may be Death. But that questions why the water worked on him, so that might be wrong. (Water causes the characters to explode and I personally found it funny than scary) 

I wish they expanded on each character so the times they died meant something and were rootable when they made it to dawn. The only three characters I really only cared about was Megan, Clover, and Nina. Megan's deaths were the most brutal and I just wanted her to make it out or at least be put out of her misery permanently. Clover and her sister were obvious references to Hannah and Beth. Clover got her answer whether she liked it or not and that's all that matters. Nina was justified stabbing Abe, I said what I said. I was tired of Abe's complaining the entire time.

We see Dr. Hill drinking either tea or coffee, and both are made with water. How was he able to drink it if the water makes people go boom? Does the coffee ground or tea leaves negate the boom? I need answers. 

The psycho was a total it girl. Sees a car? Kills psycho Clover with it, he wasn't for having competition. Sees a group of teens? His time to shine. He wasn't gonna give them a break at all. Too bad he didn't know that teamwork makes the dream work. 

Do I regret seeing this? No. I think turning your brain off and just going along makes it better. But critically, it's an alright movie. I wouldn't say it's the worst.

I don't think making a movie based on Until Dawn was necessary, the game is an interactive movie practically. But here we are, 2025 with a movie based on an interactive movie game.

I think a 5/10 is a fair score overall.

Though, I would not be upset if there was a sequel.

the heat is consuming and the honey coated cogs of the mind spin at the speed of a descending haze.

the most manageable thing to do, it seems, is start putting seeds in the ground. 



* the rhizome of ginger
* rooted strands of spicy thai basil
* seeds of blue butterfly pea flower
* the mother of garlic chives 



our balloon had floated to our neighbor’s house, where we’d found the garlic chives and a girthy carrot which we swatted into each other’s faces and bickered under the shade of kalo leaf and the brims of our hats, on a slope of peanut grass. 



what happened to the girl in the windowsill and her 70 year old bicycle? when I saw her today she had flushed cheeks and stood too close to the flames in the basket of a hot air balloon. there’s something terrifying about looking down and seeing your feet so far off of the ground.



She sat in a circle in a church basement. Someone wore a string of beads around her waist. Someone else read a manifesto in a firm voice, scuffed sneakers fidgeting rhythmically. She sat in the circle and remembered again what it was to be alone. That deliciously satisfying feeling of designing your own adventure. You create your experience in whatever space you move through. You look out at the world from behind your lens and you absorb, maybe you are inconspicuous, maybe you choose to open up cracks of your mind. She’d articulated that at once point to ears that didn’t hear. I never want to be perceived as a half of a whole, it’s an experience a female endures quite differently. 



The me in a sundress, aside your swimtrunks cannot be whole me. I am not a force to be reckoned with. I am not my muscle and my sweat in the soil. I am not my labor of mind, my glimmer of anarchy, my sheath of autonomy. I am the rose to lemon. The ebb to flow. The wick. 



	It was like picking up an old book. You know the characters with some familiarity, you remember the excitement of anticipating this plotline, you are a stranger in the skeleton of a frame but I know with some certainty that it’s better to move forward and relax the muscles of my face. 

	There was nobody to return to, nobody to report to, nobody to make her late, to leave early. She remembered a version of herself that would walk through the city til she saw a glow. She had walked into a game of poker being played inside the cockpit of an Alice Springs airplane. She’d climbed down to an aha cover band in a stone basement layered with persian rugs. Someone had pressed their two fingers between her brows and slowly separated them, erasing the wrinkle. She felt like the beginning of a person she remembered she liked very much. 



I watch the trees, I stare at their clasped hands. Magnolia.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of a 10-gallon water tank depend on several crucial features.

**Material:** The material used in a water tank significantly impacts its durability, safety, and suitability for different applications. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is a common choice due to its BPA-free, food-grade properties, ensuring the water remains safe for consumption. Stainless steel tanks offer superior durability and resistance to corrosion but can be more expensive. The material should also be UV-resistant if the tank will be exposed to sunlight to prevent degradation and maintain water quality.

**Dimensions and Shape:** The dimensions and shape of a 10-gallon water tank determine its ease of storage and portability. Rectangular tanks are often preferred for their space-saving design, fitting neatly into storage compartments or against walls. Cylindrical tanks may offer better structural integrity. Consider the available space and intended mounting location when choosing the shape and size of the tank. Check if the dimensions match standard mounting brackets if you plan to use a holder.

**Inlet/Outlet Fittings:** The inlet and outlet fittings are critical for connecting the tank to water sources and appliances. Look for durable, leak-proof fittings made from materials like brass or stainless steel. The size and type of fittings should match your plumbing connections. Some tanks come with multiple ports for versatile configurations, allowing you to connect to various systems simultaneously. Proper threading is essential to prevent leaks and ensure a secure connection.

**Pressure Rating:** The pressure rating indicates the maximum water pressure the tank can withstand. This is particularly important if the tank will be connected to a pressurized water system. Exceeding the pressure rating can cause the tank to rupture, leading to water damage. Ensure the tank's pressure rating is compatible with your water source and any pumps or appliances connected to it. A pressure relief valve is a valuable safety feature to prevent over-pressurization.

**Portability:** The portability of a 10-gallon water tank is essential for applications like camping, RV use, and emergency preparedness. Look for tanks with integrated handles or a design that facilitates easy lifting and carrying. The weight of the tank when full should also be considered. A lighter tank, even if slightly less durable, may be preferable for frequent transport.

**Ventilation:** Proper ventilation is necessary to prevent pressure buildup and maintain water quality inside the tank. A vented cap allows air to escape, preventing the tank from collapsing or expanding due to temperature changes or water usage. The vent should also prevent contaminants from entering the tank. Some tanks feature a one-way vent that allows air to flow out but not in, further protecting the water from contamination.

 ## Core Benefits

A 10-gallon water tank offers several practical benefits for various applications.

**Emergency Water Storage:** A 10-gallon water tank is ideal for emergency preparedness, providing a readily available water supply during power outages, natural disasters, or disruptions to the municipal water supply. Storing 10 gallons of water ensures that a small family has enough drinking water for several days. Having a dedicated water tank eliminates the need to rely on potentially contaminated sources and provides peace of mind during emergencies.

**Portable Water Source:** The compact size and manageable weight of a 10-gallon water tank make it an excellent portable water source for camping, RV travel, and outdoor activities. It can be easily transported in a vehicle and used to supply water for cooking, cleaning, and drinking. Compared to carrying multiple smaller containers, a single 10-gallon tank simplifies water management and reduces the risk of spills.

**Off-Grid Water Supply:** A 10-gallon water tank can be used as part of an off-grid water system, supplying water to cabins, tiny homes, and remote locations. It can be filled from a well, rainwater harvesting system, or transported from a water source. When paired with a small water pump, it can provide pressurized water for showers, sinks, and other household needs.

**Appliance Water Supply:** A 10-gallon water tank is a convenient water source for small appliances that require a direct water supply, such as coffee makers, portable dishwashers, and humidifiers. It eliminates the need for constant refilling and provides a consistent water supply for these appliances. This is particularly useful in areas with limited access to plumbing or when using appliances in remote locations.

**Home Brewing:** Home brewers often use 10-gallon water tanks to store and transport water for brewing beer or wine. The tank's food-grade material ensures that the water remains pure and free from contaminants that could affect the flavor of the final product. The ability to easily transport the tank makes it convenient for brewing in different locations or sharing water with other brewers.

 ## FAQs Section

**Is a 10-gallon water tank suitable for drinking water?**

Yes, provided the tank is made from food-grade, BPA-free materials such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or stainless steel. Ensure the tank is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before use to remove any manufacturing residues. Regularly clean the tank to prevent the growth of bacteria or algae and maintain water quality.

**How often should I clean my 10-gallon water tank?**

It is recommended to clean the tank at least every 6 months, or more frequently if you notice any signs of contamination, such as algae growth or a foul odor. Use a solution of water and bleach (approximately 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water) to sanitize the tank. Rinse thoroughly with clean water to remove any traces of bleach.

**Can I use a 10-gallon water tank for storing hot water?**

Most 10-gallon water tanks are not designed for storing hot water. Using them for this purpose could damage the tank or cause it to leach harmful chemicals into the water. If you need to store hot water, use a tank specifically designed for that purpose, such as a water heater.

**How do I prevent algae growth in my 10-gallon water tank?**

To prevent algae growth, store the tank in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. Regularly clean and sanitize the tank. Consider using a water stabilizer or purification tablets to inhibit algae growth and maintain water quality.

1kcnrmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1kcnrmu/got_rejected_today_havent_dated_in_years/,"Got rejected today, haven’t dated in YEARS","I (24M) am currently in college and on paper I think I’m a decent dude to consider dating. I am from a good family (no drug addicts, insane people), decent in the money department, have a college degree (one year from my second college degree), have a lot of ambition for my hobbies (hypertrophy training, luxury watches/jewelry, my culture, travel, anime lol), talk about women respectfully, and I’ve done things that many people would never consider like traveling to a foreign country alone, moving to a different country to teach English ect). 

Despite being fairly successful and with a bright future, I don’t have any dating success. I think that a few big reasons are that I’m not having success is because I’m not outstanding at anything per se and aren’t seen as an option. I’m more of an introvert but can still have nice conversations with others. It just feels like being average isn’t enough for a guy nowadays? (Please feel free to prove me wrong) 

I am an Asian male in the Midwest and I feel like that is a huge factor too. I literally HATE being that guy to pull that card, but after so many rejections and patterns, it just feels like I have no chance to have a romantic connection with a girl. I feel very invisible and starting to get else conscious. Based on my observations (and I try to be non biased) it seems like Asian girls don’t really like Asian guys where I live and other girls don’t see me as an option. I don’t want to have to CONVINCE people that I’m “different” from others who look like me. I do like other types of girls too so don’t think I have a rule or something regarding race. Anyway, it makes me feel like I have to be like a superhero of a guy to get the average success. 

Many videos on the internet will say things like don’t be needy, don’t drop your life for a girl, have your own life, have good hygiene, dress well which are so obvious and I already do. It’s crazy because I see people with none traits of these are still dating people. 

All of this said, of course women are right, right? There’s a reason I am not being chosen. It’s been like this for thousands of years lol And being bitter about it isn’t cool and is not what I want to happen to me. But it also makes me think, does this generation have something wrong with it? It seems on both sides that people are so easily willing to drop people and there’s no forgiveness, loyalty, or work put into friendships because you can just tell people you had an issue with to fuck off because there’s a million other people on social media to entertain you. 

As I’ve aged and thought deeply about life and its intricacies I feel like you can argue for both sides of any opinion, making me unable to know what I’m doing wrong. For example: girls who are attractive don’t get approached because they are seen as like so high up, intimidating and likely already taken to the point that nobody tries. Alternatively, you could also say that attractive girls are always approached at coffee shops, the mall, even at work because they are good looking and people are willing to go out of their way to connect with them. See how both arguments are convincing enough to not know which one to believe? 

In summary, it seems on paper that I should be able to have dating success but don’t. I have already checked off the basic minimum requirements. It seems like geographically I am disadvantaged. I want to try a different approach to dating but with so many varying opinions it’s hard to decide what the heck I’m doing wrong.

I know the flair I chose was just venting, but if you could give any advice to me I’d really appreciate it.

1kcnqx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1kcnqx8/downshifting_problems_r50_auto_mini_hatchback/,Downshifting problems (r50 auto mini hatchback),"Helloooooo. I bought a mini from my friend who did little to no maintenance on it (i'm talking engine oil \*sludge,\*) so she's a fix it for me.

One of her big problems is downshifting, especially while engine braking and/or going uphill. The engine sounds like you're revving it HARD while braking, and the RPM shoots up. When you apply gas, it jumps forward and makes a loud VRRrr noise (not like a bonk or bubble or anything,) then cuts it out. Problem with that is that you've usually not slowed down by then. I'm pretty sure it's downshifting in general, cause it'll happen when you're braking too- just not as hard, and usually only when you're braking quickly. Barring quick downshifts, braking doesn't cause any symptoms, including when idle.

The other possibly related problem would be her having occasional problems accelerating- similarish rev feeling and higher than normal RPMs, esp when starting/going uphill. She usually evens out fairly easily/reliably, and functions normally.

This is an upgrade from before, mind you. I changed the oil + filter, replaced the spark plugs, secured the wires (they were loose,) and the positive battery terminal T bolt (not needed, lost the first one lol) and it got WAY better. Before it was practically all the time with any speed changes, and the only speed she didn't hate maintaining was 40mph. She also had the rough idling, super loud engine, misfires, etc etc- that also got better. She still has rough idling, but much better- with the exception of the downshifting she's only really angry when I drive her without letting her warm up for 10+ min. Personality of an old grumpy grandma who needs her coffee

I haven't changed the spark plug wires + coils- super expensive (relative to plugs) and I have to refund the tools I got first- no bones to spend here. I also haven't changed (or checked) the transmission fluid- its on the list, unless somehow the fluid is squeaky clean. Her serp belt (and associated things) are fine, and the radiator doesn't seem messed up. The filter definitely needs to be cleaned/replaced, but idk how it would contribute to these problems. Any ideas on whats up?

I think replaced wires + coils would help a lot, considering how much better she got from changed plugs. There's nothing broken with them, and no leaks- they're just very old methinks. The other idea I have would be something with the fuel system being fucked up- it happens way more under 1/3 a tank, and she's grumpy if she's not 1/2 or more. I just used the fix finder from auto zone, it only came up with a loose/broken fuel cap- which I'll fix, she doesnt pass emissions now and I'm pretty sure thats bc I accidentally fucked the cap up- its been a little over a month since the test and theres been nothing but improvements.

I am REALLY hoping its nothing with the transmission itself. Even if i had the money to spare, it wouldn't be worth it, especially since I dont think i could repair/replace most of the related parts at all. I'm barely moderately experienced with auto maintenance/repair, if that.

**INTRO :** Hi hello, I’m Sam! I’m a 29 year old (ancient, I know) who is healed and content and very open to finding his lifelong person and partner. I’ve been through a lot by this point, but I’ve decided the struggle has been for a purpose, to singularly make me a kinder, more empathetic person, capable of caring for others and himself that much more purposefully. There will always be something that happens - I think now it’s how we choose to respond to it, as individuals and, hopefully, as a duo. If devotion and laughter and always having each other’s backs is your thing, read on\~

**WHERE YOU AT? :** Currently, I am in the US and, more specifically, the East Coast. That will likely not remain for much longer as I suss out what my next steps are, the major factors being grad school, careers, and *the collapse of the United States.*

**A RELATIONSHIP? – \[YES\] :** To me, an ideal relationship isn’t just being in love or in lust or two best friends that eventually shrug and say “yeah, might as well.” It’s *all* of those and so much more. You should be able to refer to each other as “babe, dude, lover” all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we’ll choose one another each day over everything and everyone else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to, working and playing together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we’re House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that’s okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we’re running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it’s together and with belief in each other. That’s really what I’m looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

**WHAT HE’S LOOKING FOR :** Well if I knew where to find you, I wouldn’t be scrawling all this! Truthfully, I don’t know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It’s really about more who is inhabiting that person? It’s who that image *is* that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor™ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That’s a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior™! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I’m going to guess you’ll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you’re femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them, *amazing.* Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical – and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we’re golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

**LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS :** I will attempt, and fail, to be concise - I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil. I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that’s just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let’s go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I’d love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my “gotta stay alive until” to hype myself up when things seem grim. I’m also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that’s a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. Let’s make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I’ll save that for after we’ve started chatting - otherwise, I’m just blathering into the void as usual. I’m game for most everything, especially if it’s nerdy, that’s the tl;dr. I’ve never been to a concert so, maybe we can solve that.

**CONCLUSION :** If you’ve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I’m at least a little interesting, I’ve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let’s figure out if we have something here. The “worst” that could happen is that you’ll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We’ll find out I suppose.

That’s all for now, and what an all it was. Thank you and, take care out there.

1kcno9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicminis/comments/1kcno9f/downshifting_problems_r50_auto_mini_hatchback/,Downshifting problems (r50 auto mini hatchback),"Helloooooo. I bought a mini from my friend who did little to no maintenance on it (i'm talking engine oil \*sludge,\*) so she's a fix it for me.

One of her big problems is downshifting, especially while engine braking and/or going uphill. The engine sounds like you're revving it HARD while braking, and the RPM shoots up. When you apply gas, it jumps forward and makes a loud VRRrr noise (not like a bonk or bubble or anything,) then cuts it out. Problem with that is that you've usually not slowed down by then. I'm pretty sure it's downshifting in general, cause it'll happen when you're braking too- just not as hard, and usually only when you're braking quickly. Barring quick downshifts, braking doesn't cause any symptoms, including when idle.

The other possibly related problem would be her having occasional problems accelerating- similarish rev feeling and higher than normal RPMs, esp when starting/going uphill. She usually evens out fairly easily/reliably, and functions normally.

This is an upgrade from before, mind you. I changed the oil + filter, replaced the spark plugs, secured the wires (they were loose,) and the positive battery terminal T bolt (not needed, lost the first one lol) and it got WAY better. Before it was practically all the time with any speed changes, and the only speed she didn't hate maintaining was 40mph. She also had the rough idling, super loud engine, misfires, etc etc- that also got better. She still has rough idling, but much better- with the exception of the downshifting she's only really angry when I drive her without letting her warm up for 10+ min. Personality of an old grumpy grandma who needs her coffee

I haven't changed the spark plug wires + coils- super expensive (relative to plugs) and I have to refund the tools I got first- no bones to spend here. I also haven't changed (or checked) the transmission fluid- its on the list, unless somehow the fluid is squeaky clean. Her serp belt (and associated things) are fine, and the radiator doesn't seem messed up. The filter definitely needs to be cleaned/replaced, but idk how it would contribute to these problems. Any ideas on whats up?

I think replaced wires + coils would help a lot, considering how much better she got from changed plugs. There's nothing broken with them, and no leaks- they're just very old methinks. The other idea I have would be something with the fuel system being fucked up- it happens way more under 1/3 a tank, and she's grumpy if she's not 1/2 or more. I just used the fix finder from auto zone, it only came up with a loose/broken fuel cap- which I'll fix, she doesnt pass emissions now and I'm pretty sure thats bc I accidentally fucked the cap up- its been a little over a month since the test and theres been nothing but improvements.

I am REALLY hoping its nothing with the transmission. Even if i had the money to spare it wouldn't be worth it, especially since I dont think i could repair/replace most of the related parts at all. I'm barely moderately experienced with auto maintenance/repair, if that.

1kcnnx1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcnnx1,Moving into my first place with my partner... layout help!!!,"Hi all! I am moving next week and am stumped with how we are going to lay everything out. Some suggestions, advice, and/or product recommendations would be great!

We are bringing a few of our own furniture items: TV, cat tree, litter box, two desks, laundry basket, coffee table, sofa bed, and a king size ottoman bed. I've included some pictures of what we are bringing for reference!

**First bedroom:** 

* We are getting rid of the black desk.
* This is where my desk (140x65, pictured) and bed (W: 182 x D: 220 x H: 120cm) will need to go.
   * *The bed in the picture is the same style but mine is a sage green.*
* Need to fit a cat tree in this room, preferably next to the desk.

**Living Room:** 

* We both work from home so we need to fit another desk in the living room. It’s not as big as the other desk, probably about 150cm width? 
* We are keeping everything that's currently in it. 
* We also want to put shelving in, either wall hanging or a shelving unit.

**Second Bedroom:**

* Going to be a room for our parrot/guest room/storage for instruments. 
* We are getting the bed taken out and putting a sofa bed. 
* We have a large bird cage to put in there. 
* Also, the floor plans aren’t up to date as they added an en-suite in this bedroom. 

Honestly not really looking for layout advice for this room as its mostly for my partner's stuff.

This list is only a handful of the ones we've seen from weekend onwards. Also this list does NOT even include:
-  Tonnes of very innocent prompts being rejected over content policies that seem hugely inconsistent (since some people are making & posting sexualized imagery, famous real people, etc)
- Fake time-to-wait instructs that are overridden when the user just tells it that time has passed
- Random account suspensions, bans, shadowbans, etc that have left users confused. 

Many people got very excited about the sycophancy. I wasn't hugely interested in that topic because while it made for hilarious content I frankly thought it was more likely to be an (unintended) side effect of the nerfing that appeared to be surging at the same time...at least based on post topic/volume here.. (To put it very overly simplistically, if you make something 'dumber' then a level of warmth that would previously have been nicely counterbalanced by smarts is no longer counterbalanced).  .......Openai also seemed keen to focus on the sycophancy issue (and largely stay quiet on this other stuff).

I am a 27 years old pharmacist and i am a Muslim Egyptian.

All my life i was top 10 in my school, had a lot of friends, loved by my family and neighbours, have a lot of energy and high expectations, but there was something wrong about my health!

If i eat anything i would feel depressed and sleepy so my response to that was not eating anything all day (except drinking coffee) and then eat right before bed time.

At my third year in pharmacy colleg i reached the highest level of mental performance, i was impressed by my ability to read and proccess information in nearly every field of science.

And then i decided that i want to eat normally to be able to socialize better.

Just one month after this decision, my life turned upside down.

I started to experience heart palpitations, inability to concentrate at all and i couldn't read a single page. And after getting an A in college, i was hardly getting a C.

1kcn69u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1kcn69u/scotland_2025_trip_reports_spirit_of_speyside_day/,"Scotland 2025 Trip Reports - Spirit of Speyside Day One (The Glenrothes, Benromach, GlenAllachie)","Everything leading up to today was just a warmup; now it’s time for the main event. Although Spirit of Speyside officially kicked off yesterday, today (Thursday) was the first day of events that I attended. I’ll organize this post a little differently than my previous travel reports, breaking things down by event.

***The Glenrothes Whisky Tasting***

[The fabulous Glenrothes tasting at The Spirit Safe](https://preview.redd.it/gl9g3dwua9ye1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51e71f389bb591c9e4dbc73bc629aa4cd4acee93)

* Despite the unassuming name, this gathering turned out to be one of the most epic and generous events of the day. Kat headed up the tasting for Glenrothes along with the newly appointed (technically, tomorrow might be his first day on the job) distillery manager. This was Glenrothes’s first time at the festival, and they clearly decided to make a splash in their debut. Because the event description was a little vague, I said to my wife the night before, “They might have us taste the core range up to the 25-year-old, but I’m holding out hope that they’ll pull out something a little older or rarer.” Did they ever. For 60 pounds, I got to taste drams of the 18-year-old, 25-year-old, 32-year-old, 42-year-old, *and* a bonus dram, a 44-year-old single cask available only at the estate. That last bottle goes for 9,200 pounds so … yeah, this was a huge hit.
* The Glenrothes has a fascinating history. The distillery was founded by James Stewart, the same man who started The Macallan. But through decades of twists and turns, both the distillery itself and the single-malt brand got split up and sold to a few different owners. At one point, the well-known wine merchants and independent bottlers Berry Bros. owned the single-malt brand but not the distillery, meaning they were the only ones allowed to sell The Glenrothes whisky as a single malt. Anyways, as seems to happen in life, things came full circle: Edrington Group repurchased the distillery and then, several years later, the single-malt brand. So now, almost 150 years after its founding, The Glenrothes and The Macallan are once again sister distilleries, even getting their favored sherry-seasoned casks from the same source in Jerez.
* The people who attend festivals like Spirit of Speyside and similar festivals are the biggest whisky nerds you’ll ever meet, and I mean that in the best possible way. Everyone becomes fast friends because we share this common hobby, and it’s such a fun way to bond with others. At this event, I sat with a German gentleman who drives his motorcycle from Bavaria to Scotland every year. What an epic road trip. It might sound strange to say that I was jealous of someone attending the same event as me, but hearing about his adventures, I was incredibly jealous.

Without further ado, here are some notes on these spectacular whiskies:

**Glenrothes 18 y.o.** (43%) - The Glenrothes aims to produce a light, fruity spirit, one that lends itself well to long aging periods and that doesn’t get overly oaky or tannic even after decades in the cask. The 18-year-old is a great starting point that exemplifies the house style: classic sherry flavors of toffee, cherries, and other berries or fruits, with a wisp of a finish, as I’d expect from a dram at 43%.

**Glenrothes 25 y.o.** (43%) - These vertical tastings always give a fascinating insight into how a distillery’s spirit evolves with time. Another seven years in sherry casks brings some more savoury or aromatic flavors like vanilla, almond, ginger, pears, and even some tropical fruit. It stays light, though, almost delicate, consistent with the house style.

**Glenrothes 32 y.o.** (43%) - When we reached this point in the tasting, people started asking about prices and then whistling admiringly when they heard the answer. This limited expression consists of around 2,000 bottles that sell for 1,950 pounds. Worthy of a whistle, right? Another seven-year leap helps give this whisky a supple texture, with the addition of more complex, perfume-y florals and some spice cabinet and tea notes to the usual sherried scotch profile. One fun fact: as part of a series honoring past distillery workers, this whisky is named after John Smith, The Glenrothes’ distillery manager for … you guessed it, 32 years.

**Glenrothes 42 y.o.** (43%) - This even smaller outrun is a vatting of four refill sherry casks. Whisky this old tends to converge on a common, difficult-to-describe flavor in my mind, a sort of waxy, candied tropical fruit, and Glenrothes is no exception. This whisky exhibits a wonderful balance of fruit and spices: pears, apricots, and pineapples on the one hand, and then cardamom, coriander (Kat’s suggested note - she even passed around some coriander for us to compare), or mukhwas on the other. What a once-in-a-lifetime treat to try this dram.

**Glenrothes Estate Single Cask, 44 y.o.** (48.1%) - This whisky is available only at the distillery, but the distillery isn’t open for visitors. Huh, say that again? Apparently, private clients are invited to visit from time to time, and they are the only ones who can purchase this bottle. Of course, with only 105 bottles available at 9,200 pounds a pop, it doesn’t matter whether this is limited to the distillery or available at my neighborhood 7-11, it ain’t coming home with me either way. This whisky was dramatically different than the others, with a nose that reminded me of pecan pie and coconut flakes, and a palate that featured a similar profile of sugared nuts, vanilla, and toasted oak. Turns out, this is a very unusual Glenrothes that has lived its entire, long life in an ex-bourbon barrel, which explains the dramatic shift in flavor profile.

***Benromach Single Cask Tasting***

[A cask of 2006 Benromach sitting in Warehouse No. 2](https://preview.redd.it/4qnqwro2b9ye1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e11826d2c898c2f046ff29b0da949be6b3d3cd9)

* I was incredibly excited to visit Benromach because it has been my favorite Speyside distillery for the past two years. They are putting out incredibly affordable and crushable whiskies, particularly their 15-year-old, which is widely available in the U.S. for around $80. Ridiculous value from a bygone era; and, in many ways, a style of whisky from a bygone era too. Benromach, unlike almost all its peers, still uses peat to dry their barley, so it resembles what Speyside whisky was like before the 1970s.
* Susan, who took us around the distillery, did an incredible job teaching us about its history and production process. When Diageo mothballed Benromach in 1983, they apparently stripped out everything of value from the plant, including even the metal stairs. Benromach’s old washback went to Royal Lochnagar, and its Porteus mill went to the visitor center at Oban. So when Gordon & MacPhail bought it in the 1990s, they completely rebuilt the place from the ground up. It is a very, very old-fashioned distillery, still doing everything manually with a small crew. Unlike almost every other distillery I’ve visited, which now has computers that control and fine-tune the production process, there is no computerized equipment on site (except, as Susan put it, a computer upstairs where “the boys can check their email”). Fun fact about their tiny, 110-year-old mill: only one person in the entire U.K. knows how to repair it.
* On the brand side, Gordon & MacPhail are also purists. When they bought the distillery, they not only bought all the warehoused stock with it, they even went out to the open market and bought any casks or lots of Benromach floating around in the world. For this reason, there are almost no independent bottles of Benromach–and aren’t likely to be any in the future. Instead, almost all of Benromach’s very modest production–about 9,000 liters a week, or 500,000 a year–goes into its own single malts. Also, after much experimentation, they settled on a house style that emphasizes the almost exclusive use of first-fill casks, so its main expressions, like the 15-year-old, are a blend of first-fill bourbon and sherry casks. How can you not love this place?

Here are the casks that two members of the warehouse team bottled up for us, and which we got to try with one of Gordon & MacPhail’s master blenders:

[Our full tasting lineup of five Benromach single casks, ranging from 7 to 18 years old](https://preview.redd.it/6iaplql6b9ye1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba29b5b7086ea4d28a89959ec64f872da920d331)

**Benromach 2010 Single Cask, First-Fill Bourbon Barrel** (58.3%) - When they used a whisky thief to pull this out of the barrel, it had so much suspended char that it looked like they’d just flushed it through a chimney. This is as straight from the barrel as whisky gets. Nilla wafers and baking spices on the nose, with a sharp, peppery, spicy palate that featured “a bit of banana” (the master blender’s note). Maybe it was because this was such a step up in ABV compared to the lighter drams of Glenrothes from earlier in the day, but this was a little too intense.

**Benromach 2013 Single Cask, Juan Pino Sherry Hogshead** (60.1%) - Sherried whiskies come off one of two ways to me, which I think of as “dry” sherry and “sweet” sherry. Dry is a little earthy and briny, like a dry red wine. That’s this single cask to a tee. It’s salty and leathery, but with a building sweetness that shows up as candied nuts on the palate and finish. Like most Benromachs, this one is lightly peated, but the general dryness made it hard for me to pick out any noticeable peat in this one.

**Benromach 2006 Single Cask, Sassicaia Wine Cask** (60.3%) - A few years back, we visited Tuscany and got to try some Super Tuscans. This whisky is Benromach aged in a Super Tuscan wine cask, and a significantly older, single-cask version of a whisky that the distillery puts out semi-regularly. And while I’m not normally a wine-cask lover, this one played nice with my palate. Raspberries and grape jam; furniture polish and oak; and just some hints of earthy peat on the finish.

**Benromach 2014 Single Cask, Virgin Oak Cask** (60.1%) - If anyone needs convincing that the cask gives 60 or 70% of the flavor to a whisky, I’d invite them to try this dram. It tastes so much like a bourbon without some of the more generically sweet characteristics that come from corn. Vanilla, oak, cocoa powder or coffee, etc. It’s an excellent dram, although it also leaves me wondering whether (or when) I’d reach for this over the many spectacular cask-strength bourbons out there. This is also a single-cask variant on another Benromach expression, the Benromach Organic, which is the first organic scotch.

**Benromach 2017 Single Cask, Heavily Peated, First-Fill Bourbon Barrel** (59.6%) - Well, I’m nothing if not predictable: the heavily peated expression was my favorite in the lineup. The Aberdeenshire peat used here, in contrast to the famed Islay peat of a Lagavulin or a Laphroaig, tends to be an earthier, grassier, sweeter peat. Interestingly enough, the distillery has a shorthand code for different types of barrels and labels this one “B1I”--meaning Bourbon, First Fill, Islay (to denote that it’s very peaty, even though the peat doesn’t come from there). Like a lot of peated whiskies, though, it excels because its earthy, floral peat contrasts and tempers the sweet vanilla and citrus fruit character of the first-fill bourbon.

**Benromach Distillery Exclusive Single Cask, First-Fill Bourbon, 10 y.o.** (60%) - I forgot to get the exact specs on this one, which we tried quickly before I had to run and head to my next and final event of the day. But in general terms, it was a roughly 10-year-old ex-bourbon single cask right around 60% in ABV, which seems like the magic number around which all these Benromach single casks cluster. This was a stellar dram, and I liked it better than the 14- or 15-year-old that kicked off this epic tasting. It had a much fruitier and more well-integrated profile, so I can see why they picked it for the shop.

***GlenAllachie Evening Q&A Session with Billy Walker***

[The Q&A set up at GlenAllachie's distillery bar](https://preview.redd.it/yzjxmscfb9ye1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d4474a13f08fca8072dfce7ee757b79f67a8e0e)

* In the world of whisky, Billy Walker is a big name. For those who don’t know, he’s a master blender and serial entrepreneur who has bought and developed several whisky distilleries, including Glendronach, Benriach, and Glenglassaugh (which he then sold to Brown-Foreman). With the proceeds from that sale, he then bought GlenAllachie Distillery in 2017. And within the past seven or eight years, he’s pretty much made GlenAllachie into the new Glendronach in my eyes–an up-and-coming distillery putting out some of the best sherry-aged whisky on the market today. The people who showed up for this Q&A clearly agreed. There were some massive Billy Walker fanboys in the crowd, including people who asked questions that pretty much boiled down to, “How are you so amazing?”
* Billy and the two other GlenAllachie team members who held the conversation had a great rapport, and it was great to see that they weren’t scared to razz the boss from time to time. Billy was also quite frank and direct about his opinions. At one point, someone asked him about putting ice in whisky, which he strongly discouraged. The person then responded, “I just visited distillery X \[won’t name names here\], and they said it’s good to put a little ice cube in their whisky.” Without missing a beat, Billy retorted, “If I were making what they’re putting out, I’d say that too.”
* We learned lots of minute inside baseball about GlenAllachie, and I won’t note it all here. But perhaps the most interesting fact is that they’re experimenting with many different types of oak, including ones that have never been used by any other brands to my knowledge, such as Mongolian oak and Colombian oak. For Mongolian oak in particular, it’s a similar species to Japanese Mizunara, so they’re hoping that it imparts some of the same characteristics without the outrageous expense (3,500 pounds per cask) that come with Mizunara.
* Speaking of Mizunara, this year’s Spirit of Speyside exclusive is an 11-year-old single cask that matured in an Oloroso sherry butt before being finished in Mizunara. I got to try a small nip of it in Edinburgh on day one of my trip, and again here tonight, before I bought a bottle. I was dreading what the price might be considering how many places have started marking up festival exclusives, but thankfully GlenAllachie know how to treat their fans the right way and offered this at a more-than-fair 100 pounds. Insta-buy for me, especially since Billy Walker graciously signed bottles for everyone after the event wrapped up. This is honestly how every distillery should do a festival exclusive bottling. At the end of the day, it’s a few hundred bottles, so it’s not going to make or break the company’s year. Just do a great whisky at a fair price for the people who care enough to make it all the way out here, rather than trying to get the last nickel and dime (or pence and pound) out of your most loyal fanbase. This is a lesson that many other distilleries, especially my favorites out on Islay, could stand to relearn.

Alright, here are my final set of tasting notes for the night:

**White Heather 15 y.o.** (46%) - We started off with a blend owned by GlenAllachie, and one that the company wants to grow more in coming years. It’s about 55% grain and 45% malt whisky, including plenty of GlenAllachie but also a small bit, around 3%, of Caol Ila from Islay. Single-malt fans tend to crap on blends, but this is a very pleasant dram with a standout note of oranges or tangerines that give it a summer-by-the-pool vibe.

**GlenAllachie 12 y.o.** (46%) - This whisky just won the award for World’s Best Single Malt Scotch Whisky at the World Whisky Awards. It’s a mix of Oloroso, PX, red wine, and virgin oak casks, and it has strains of all of those influences, leaning largely toward the sweet, intensely sherried house style. Best in the world? I’m not going to go that far. But it’s definitely one of the best 12-year-old whiskies on the market, and a great exemplar of the philosophy that Billy Walker applies to the brand. As he put it, other blenders strive for consistency, but GlenAllachie strives for perfection.

**GlenAllachie Ex-Solera Oloroso Sherry Cask, 17 yo.** (58.1%) - This was one of the standout drams of the day, which really says something about it. The type of cask was very unique. Unlike the modern-day standard, which is a barrel seasoned with sherry specifically intended for use in whisky maturation, this expression matured in an oak barrel actually used in the famed solera system common among Jerez bodegas. Basically, whereas other “sherry casks” might have spent about two years in contact with sherry that’s never intended to be sold on its own, this barrel potentially got used for decades (soleras sometimes include barrels that are 100 years old or more) to make real sherry before it came to GlenAllachie. The nose was so intensely rich and sweet it almost flipped the other way and was reminiscent, at times, of soy sauce. Each sip was like diving into a platter of figs and dates. This was a gorgeous whisky.

**GlenAllachie 2013 Oloroso and Mizunara Finish Single Cask, Spirit of Speyside 2025 Exclusive, 11 y.o.** (60.4% ABV) - I won't repeat my notes on this one, which I first tried on Monday. Suffice to say, it was just as good the second time around, and I'm glad I now own a bottle.

**Meikle Tor, 5 y.o.** (48%) - This young, peated whisky is a fascinating extension of GlenAllachie’s family line and has been a big hit since it got released sometime last year. We tried “The Sherry One,” which is Highland-peated whisky matured in a mix of sherry casks. Compared to Islay whiskies, Meikle Tor is much fruitier and sweeter due to a combination of (a) a very long, 164-hour fermentation; (b) the use of Highland peat, which tends to be more heather-y and sweeter than Islay’s maritime, medicinal peat; and (c) the use of sherry casks. It’s a great, young sweet-and-peat combo.

Thanks as always for reading, and I’ll be back tomorrow with notes on some events at Glenfarclas, Macallan, Craigellachie, and more!

Kevin was shall we say unique. Part of his job was to answer the office phone. He also liked to chew gum. I informed him customers do not want to hear him chomping gum on the phone. He continued to chew gum and I called him out on it. His answer was he just had coffee. (Customers would not visit us, just phone, and he sat near no one) We finally had to add it to the policy manual (which was mostly created because of him) 

The best one was the day our boss had a big meeting in his office. Now, this was many years ago so my boss loved clipping articles out of newspapers. If something got referenced in a meeting he would offer to make a copy for the person. So much that he had a small personal printer by his desk (before they were common and cheap). This meeting I was also sitting in on and he wanted a copy but his copier was not working so I asked Kevin to quickly go down the hall to make a copy on one of the main copiers. 

Kevin ambles off and 10-15 minutes later he is not back and the meeting is ending so I am sent to find him. I find him standing around watching someone fix the copier. I asked him why he didn’t just use a different one around the corner. Instead, he thought it was more important to call someone to come fix it and then wait for them! 🤦🏻‍♂️

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/zo1zaGPLCU

I had gotten in contact with a divorce lawyer’s office and had a brief consultation with a secretary. It wasn’t too long and I haven’t done much more gathering of info because I’ve had 10 different final papers/projects/presentations happening and just don’t have the time or energy to work on it right now.

Since his last comments things had gone back to getting better. We still spent time together with our toddler, and things were starting to feel fun and like we were getting closer again.

Then we went for a walk today.

On our walk he asked me how I thought things had been between us. I said I thought they’d been good, that I liked spending time together. Then I asked if he was still feeling the same way as the last time we’d talked about this. He basically said yes, that he’s disappointed that he’s the problem, and if it wasn’t for him we wouldn’t be in couples therapy. He also said that he doesn’t ask me to change anything for him (which is bs, he asked me to be poly with/for him). 

I felt frustrated at this, because I’m not asking him to change, I’m asking him to do what he had done our whole relationship before he changed. He used to make me homemade picnic dates, surprise me with my favorite snacks and coffee and drinks, or my favorite chocolates from a European style chocolatier. We’d go on a date every weekend, and hang out every evening. We’d text constantly, and always found new things to talk about even after almost 8 years. 

Then once the baby was born he began pushing me away, telling me I shouldn’t rely on him, while also pushing for a polyamorous relationship. He told me he would burn the fumes in his tank to make sure others were taken care of, but then tell me he couldn’t give me those same fumes when I needed him, or even anything from his tank when it was full.

It was so the opposite of how he used to treat me.

And I told him this on our walk. His response was to say he accepts that he was at fault, but I wouldn’t be convinced of his position no matter what he said. 

I told him that he’s not accepting he was/is at fault if he keeps trying to convince me otherwise.

In our next couples therapy session I’m going to bring up that I think we’ve been both-sides-ing the issues in our relationship. I’m guilty of participating in this, I’ll defend him and try to protect his ego and work together. But honestly? I haven’t done anything wrong in this regard. I’ve acted and reacted in an impossible situation that my husband has put me in.

I just don’t know why the birth of our child changed him so much, made polyamory into such a fixation of his when that time and energy for his “self discovery” should have been put into directly caring for myself and our baby. He keeps trying to make excuses that he didn’t get to do much the first year of her life, but he:

- went on multiple hours long hikes and dinners with his friend
- went on a solo camping trip
- slept over at another friend’s house for their birthday instead of coming to the first family outing I had planned since giving birth
- went hiking and rafting a couple times with the significant others of some of my friends
- went on dates with me
- went on dates with other people
- had dinner with friends
- went on solo bike rides where he’d be gone for multiple hours or even all day

And his comeback when I point this out to him? It’s not as much as he usually did before the baby, he only got to ride his motorcycle once or twice last year. I could have done all those things too! (Never mind that I was exclusively breastfeeding our baby, and going out anywhere meant having a portable pump and refrigeration options on hand, never mind a space where I could actually comfortably sit and pump for 20-30 minutes in the middle of activities). 


Idk. Just what the fuck happened? How did I go from a devoted and loving feminist minded husband to whatever he is now?

Whatever. I’m still going to try and fix things because maybe at some point he’ll see the light, but at the same time I’m going to begin to craft my exit plan.

I stopped at a Dunkin (Northeast shitty coffee chain) to grab a coffee after work.  I pulled in and saw this slightly disheveled looking guy walking through the big parking lot towards the Dunkin. I parked and waited and watched him go inside, just kind of curious about him, and I followed shortly. 

He was up at the counter as I walked in. We made quick eye contact. I gave him plenty space. It seemed to be busy in there. There was one older woman, and maybe 6 or 7 kids sitting down eating donuts, some waiting for their food and drinks. The guy looked at me, he kind of gave a weird grin and he took maybe two slow steps closer to me all while turning and looking 90° from the register. (Like if you were going to sucker punch someone, you’d stand q way where his left shoulder would be pointed at my chest -if that makes sense) 

Red flags, alarm bells and sirens went off in my head. So I did the little impatient antsy movement thing when you’re waiting where I kinda just did a little half a circle (kept my side eye on him) but I backed up and put another maybe 2 feet distance between us. I was almost out of the door at that point. As soon as I did that he took another step or two closer to me while still kinda 90°. I am fully convinced he was going to throw a punch. Once he stopped towards me, I bee lined it out the door to my car and made sure he didn’t follow. 

There are tons of homeless with mental issues, drunks and druggies where I live, and he fit the mold of one of them. I’m wondering if there was anything else I could’ve done or should’ve done…probably just not go inside… it all happened very very quickly and I knew I did not want to get into an altercation with a gun on my hip inside a coffee shop with children everywhere. 

It’s really bugging me how quickly shit could have went down but I will say I am aware of my surroundings and I’m second guessing myself almost mad for even walking in. Any tips or advice would be super appreciated.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

---

&nbsp;


It was over in a moment.

&nbsp;

Blue didn’t have the time to run calculations. Jaime didn’t have the time to react. There was too much new information in too short of a time. There was no conscious decision made, leaving the fused consciousnesses of Jaime and Blue to rely on nothing but instinct. The problem with instinct, however, was it was made to save oneself. Jaime kicked the burning fuselage of the helicopter away from him. His feet, even through the exoskeleton, could feel the force of the explosion coming from underneath the twisted helicopter chassis. It didn’t get very far.

&nbsp;

Fire enveloped him. Shards of superhot metal dug into his flesh. It was terrifyingly familiar. Back when he’d died he’d felt the same things, the same searing pain. Honestly, it was impressive and a little tiring that he was dying this way again. Not that he was actually at any risk of death, or even permanent damage. As quickly as the holes in his skeleton had formed from super hot metal, Blue’s ever watchful eye repaired them. Metal and skin knitted themselves over the wounds so effortlessly, almost like liquid. Like someone had spilled a glass of flesh over him.

&nbsp;

But he wasn’t worried about himself. That was Brenda down there. He was sure of it. And he could feel his heart drop as Blue’s external sensors detected that the fire would make contact with the open electrical line and gas mains in mere milliseconds. He didn’t have the heart to attempt to move. After all he’d done, after all of this, it still hurt, it still wasn’t enough. Blue was putting out the fires across his body as fast as he could, but Jaime still felt their sting. He couldn’t ignore it. It was too much, he was just a kid. He wasn’t cut out for this. He’d thought like a machine, he’d ignored the cries of his own nervous system and forfeited so much control over his own body. But Brenda was still in danger. The school was still about to explode.

&nbsp;

He rocketed upwards as a plume of flame erupted underneath him. The remnants of the school cafeteria’s roof melted and crumbled inwards and blackened smoke hissed into the air. Blue, of course, had been informing him that it wouldn’t be a giant explosion that caused the school and everyone within to disappear. No, it would be slow, it would be several fires. Snakes of flame that worked their way across the innards of the school building, melting things, heating things, creating smaller explosions that made more fire. The walls would give way as the flimsy materials that held them together would succumb to the sheer heat. Debris would likely kill more people than the fire did. And then smoke inhalation. This was an older building, after all, there was nowhere for it to go but in people’s lungs.

&nbsp;

This information, Jaime decided, while being altogether helpful, was also altogether not very helpful. For his mental state, that is.

&nbsp;

He was suspended in the air, limbs hanging limply. He had all but given up. He turned over with a lifeless puff of his jets to see the spectacle below him. An inferno in bloom. Little ants with hoses and a toy truck blasting ineffectual sprays of water on a crumbling building. In the glint of a raging inferno he saw a small glimmer of a smartphone screen. His opticals zoomed in, it was cracked and melting, but it was the same phone case that Paco had given Brenda for her last birthday. The one with the raccoon ears and stripes. The black ears folded away sadly to the heat and the screen soon followed, but it had given him enough light to see a hand next to it. Bruised, probably bleeding and definitely under some debris. But it was a hand.

&nbsp;

He blinked, and zoomed downwards. The heat be damned, the pain be damned. That was his best friend down there. What was he thinking? How could he ever leave her just lying there. What would his parents say, what would her aunt say, what would Paco say? If they knew he could’ve saved her and he just didn’t because it hurt? Just because it was hard? No, he had it easier than anyone else could in his position. He had a goddamn space alien in his head. 

&nbsp;

It was enough. He had to be enough. There wasn’t another option. He reached out a hand pre-emptively, ready to grab her and rocket out of there. He was so close, almost back to the rooftop, when there was a crimson flash in the corner of his eye. But it was too late it had traveled so fast.

&nbsp;

A curved blade skewered him through the chest. He sputtered and coughed blood. Blue was already on damage control and trying to stitch the sudden cavity back together, but the blade was still in there and impeding his progress.

&nbsp;

“The correct decision,” Red mouthed. The low groan of its staticky voice crackled in the heat. “Would be to leave the girl.” Its hulking frame had appeared under him so quickly and was now hoisting him up by a blade through the chest. Behind the battered and bruised silhouette Jaime could see Brenda’s hand shrinking. They were going up, and fast.

&nbsp;

“No, no, fuck you! Stop! Fuck you!” Jaime yelled, grabbing the blade with two hands and attempting to yank it out of his chest.

&nbsp;

“I refuse. If you wish to save the girl, you must first finish our contest.” Red said, the voice warbling. Which struck Jaime as strange, as they were far enough from the inferno that the heat shouldn’t affect it anymore. That was when he noticed that the creature’s throat was, in fact, disintegrating. In fact, a lot of it was disintegrating and then rapidly reforming.

&nbsp;

The colour would’ve drained from Jaime’s face if he was not wearing a blue and black alien mask. “Brenda’s gonna die.” He could’ve saved her and Brenda’s gonna die. “I need to help her or she’s gonna die!” he yelled.

&nbsp;

“So?”

&nbsp;

Jaime’s eye twitched. He growled. Something feral inside him bubbled to the surface, not a machine but bestial. Anger. Rage. Something he hadn’t allowed himself to feel for so long.

&nbsp;

Red smirked and flung him off its blade. “Your inactions have placed something you care for in danger. You are on the battlefield, however. What will you do?” Jaime spun in the air for a moment before he righted himself and rocketed towards the reach agent with all his body could comprehend at this moment, the pure, unfiltered rage of a clenched fist.

&nbsp;

“I’ll show you what I’ll do!” he roared, kicking his boosters into overdrive. He sped forward like a beam of light and his knuckles connected with Red’s chinplate before it could even raise a blade to parry. He wouldn’t let go, however, he commanded Blue to keep the thrusters at full power and Blue obeyed. He pushed Red up into the sky with fist and followed after. The crowd below watched as a supersonic boom shattered the glass of any vehicles in the surrounding area. Blue, recognising the situation and the necessity for yelling, opened a direct line into Red’s comms. Sound would not travel faster than his fist anymore.

&nbsp;

“I’ve had enough of your shit!” Jaime screamed into his foe’s ears. He shot upwards like a comet, leaving a trail of blue fire in his wake. As unceremonious as it was, Jaime’s base fighting instincts were to kick and punch and headbutt and then punch some more. So that’s what he did. He sped headfirst into Red’s chest, eliciting an audible crack. He then proceeded to batter the being with repeated blows faster than the speed of sound. Red’s every attempt to block was too late, every strike was too fast. Jaime’s movements were so rapid that the friction of him against the air created enough heat to start a fire. Fists wreathed in blue flame crunched deeper and deeper into an exoskeleton that was barely strung together anymore. The speed was incredible, the strength was phenomenal. The skill was sorely lacking. There was none. It was all bestial, brutal. There was no thought behind it. Indeed as comms were connected Red could hear nothing but shrill screaming. The punches and the kicks and the headbutts were all random, there were no strategic points on Red’s chassis they were hitting. Nothing vital was being struck, but it was so fast. It was like some internal limiter had been removed, but it had no knowledge of any such capabilities existing on Blue class agents. Where had this come from, Red had to wonder, as it was being brutalised into a pulp. Metal plates flew off the being as they went higher and higher, then musculature, then limbs. Joints had been blown apart and disintegrated and floated like crimson dust.

&nbsp;

Jaime had decided that nothing would be enough. And he kept going and going and punching and screaming until the tendons in his arms would tear and he would lose his voice. Tears flowed freely from his eyes and evaporated at the sheer heat of his unending onslaught. Whatever he could hit, he would hit. Whatever he could see, he would break. Nothing. Would. Be. Enough.

&nbsp;

In moments, Red’s form was reduced to a floating torso. And in half a moment more Jaime had thrust his hands into the being’s chest and began ripping parts out like he was scrambling through a toolbox. Green, red and blue fluids from Red’s internals sprayed outwards as tubes and wiring flailed momentarily before they were grabbed, yanked and thrown into orbit. The creature that was mere seconds ago a whole being that had thrust a blade through Jaime’s chest was nothing more than a sputtering neck and head.

&nbsp;

In its last moments, Red felt nothing but elation. It had been defeated, but it had unearthed something groundbreaking. Before now, all Reach agents tasked with invasion had completely and utterly overwhelmed their hosts. But this agent had willingly fused with its host. And while their regular operating powers were below normal, this unshackling of the host’s capabilities were beyond even what releasing its own limiters were capable of. As Jaime’s final fist came searing towards its optical sensors, Red finished uploading the combat data it had gathered up through the emergency comm line back to Zantoss.

&nbsp;

It felt like forever.

&nbsp;

Jaime played with the red chinplate in his hands. Against Blue’s express instructions, Jaime had decided to keep a part of the first foe he’d defeated. It was bent up and twisted and barely intact, so it looked like a piece of half-chewed gum spat out and then stepped on a bunch. He held it up to the glare of the tube lights along the top of the hospital waiting room. He’d been here hours-

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, it has been one-hundred and two earth minutes.]

&nbsp;

Hours, it felt like. After he’d supersonic punched the red-beetle-agent-whatever into dust he zoomed down into the still smoldering school building. He clawed through the wreckage until he’d found her and pulled her mercifully still intact frame out of the rooftop debris she was trapped under. His adrenaline high wore off when he saw how small she looked, how frail and easily breakable. How she was bruised and bleeding and just barely breathing. He rushed her over to the fire department and escaped before any reporters could swarm him. That was three days ago.

&nbsp;

She still hadn’t woken up.

&nbsp;

He was still fielding regular calls from his parents. When it wasn’t phone calls it was messages. It was annoying, but he understood. It was like what, not even a month after he’d basically been found dead in a ditch outside of town. The moment when his mother hugged him and didn’t let go was still crystal clear in his mind. This was in part due to Blue’s perfect memory recording, but the point was that they were scared. He’d convinced them he had skipped school that day to go chill at the arcade. They were mildly disappointed in his actions but also extremely thankful for the stroke of luck. He was, of course, completely unharmed due to his ridiculously fast regenerative capabilities, so that helped sell the lie. That and the fact that of the two people that could directly corroborate his presence there, one of them was currently buried in the local cemetery without a head and the other was in this very hospital. He was still grounded, because apparently the outside was terrifying. There’d been too much weird shit happening. And they were right. At least now things were quieter. As quiet as they could be, so he’d been allowed to go visit Brenda at the hospital.

&nbsp;

“Mr. Reyes?”

&nbsp;

Jaime jumped and nearly dropped the crimson red chinplate. “Uh, yes, hi, that’s me.” Jaime grinned at the nurse that had called his name.

&nbsp;

[Mister Reyes is your paternal unit, is it not?]

&nbsp;

*Not relevant right now, Blue.* 

&nbsp;

“Ms. del Vecchio asked that you come in. Please follow me.”

&nbsp;

Jaime gulped. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Brenda’s aunt. He remembered her vaguely. A tall, middle-aged half-Latino woman who was very kind to them but very strict with others. She would give the world for her Brenda, but she also had this sternness about her Jaime could never quite place. As they rounded the corner to the ward doors, the nurse tapped her ID with a beep and Blue piped up in the ensuing silence.

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, here are several images of Brenda’s guardian.]

&nbsp;

A sequence of pictures flashed in front of Jaime’s eyes, causing him to stumble backwards in the hallway. Pictures of Brenda’s aunt ripped from the front covers of business magazines or newspaper articles. Sharply dressed in powerful poses, shaking hands with important looking people, apparently providing three new secrets to her success every other issue. She was, as far as Jaime was aware, a successful businesswoman and socialite within El Paso’s upper crust. What someone in a movie would call a mover and shaker. He just distinguished her as wealthy because she had a pool.

&nbsp;

So it was a bit of a shock when the nurse opened the door and all he saw was a wan woman sitting by the bedside of a comatose Brenda. Upon hearing them enter she wiped her face with a handkerchief and looked towards him.

&nbsp;

“Hello, Jaime. It’s good to see you.” she smiled. “I’m glad you’re unharmed.” Jaime could feel Blue’s analysis taking over. Red nose, bags under her eyes, obviously had been experiencing sobbing fits. Her pantsuit was crumpled on the side and she was in casual clothing. She hadn’t actually been home nor slept properly in the past few days, as indicated by a trash can full of empty cola cans and half-drunk cups of coffee lying around the room. It was a big room though, only the best for Brenda, he supposed.

&nbsp;

“Hi, Aunt Vecchio.” he waved weakly and took a few steps towards her. What do people ask in these scenarios?

&nbsp;

[Common courtesy would state you ask how she is feeling, Jaime Reyes.]

&nbsp;

*Blue, there’s no way I can ask that. She is totally not okay.*

&nbsp;

There was a long, uncomfortable silence only broken up by the beeping of Brenda’s heart monitor. Perhaps taking pity on Jaime, Ms. del Vecchio spoke up. “She’s been stable, but her condition hasn’t improved.” She rested a hand on Brenda’s sleeping shoulder. She reached out another hand to Jaime, who grasped it. “Please ask your parents to pray for her.”

&nbsp;

“Th-they already are.”

&nbsp;

“Good, thank you.” she said, and tightened her grip on his hand. Jaime winced. A dark expression drew across her face. “When I find the people that did this to her, I will show no mercy.”

&nbsp;

She looked him dead in the eyes. A cold stare had washed away all the emotions and vulnerability she’d been showing but a moment ago. Like that part of her had been locked away and some serious mode had taken over. “Do you know anything about what happened, Jaime?”

&nbsp;

He gulped and fiddled with the half-melted chinplate in his pocket. “No more than anyone else. I…I wasn’t at school that day.” he said, attempting to fake sheepishness.

&nbsp;

She softened somewhat, remembering she was talking to a child, after all. “Of course. I’m glad you’re okay.”

&nbsp;

*Yeah, me too.*

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, you appear to be exhibiting a large amount of cortisol.]

&nbsp;

*No shit, Blue, she’s scary as heck.*

&nbsp;

[She is indeed as imposing as the publications implied.]

&nbsp;

After a long pause, he hesitantly asked. “Do you?”

&nbsp;

“Do I what?” she said, running her hands through Brenda’s hair.

&nbsp;

“Do you know what happened?”

&nbsp;

Her head snapped towards him, and for a moment there was a vicious glare. As if to say, of course I don’t know, do you think I’d be here if I knew who did this?

&nbsp;

She smiled again. “Not more than you. There was a blue creature and a red creature. And seemingly they blew up the school.”

&nbsp;

*Oh.*

&nbsp;

[This is troublesome, Jaime Reyes.]

&nbsp;

“I’ve hired some investigators to look into it.” She smiled with her eyes closed. “They haven’t found much yet and they aren’t allowed near the school or its students for obvious reasons.”

&nbsp;

“Yeah, haha.” Jaime grinned, hands deep in his pockets. He realised he’d taken a step away from her.

&nbsp;

“So please, if you do learn anything about who did this, you can tell me.”

1. drinking water first thing in the morning
not coffee, not juice, just plain water. sounds simple but it woke up my system, helped with digestion, and honestly made me snack less during the day.


2. eating 30g of protein within an hour of waking up
this changed my energy levels and cravings completely. i used to have toast or nothing. now i do eggs or greek yogurt with chia and it keeps me full for hours.


3. walking daily, even if it’s just 20 minutes
i stopped thinking walking ""wasn’t enough"". it helped my mood, reduced stress, and got me out of the house. on bad days it was all i could manage and it still counted.


4. making one simple high-protein recipe every sunday
this saved me. i make a chicken and veggie bake: diced chicken breast, chopped zucchini, bell pepper, onion, olive oil, and garlic. bake it all for 40 minutes. i keep it in the fridge and eat it with rice or lettuce wraps all week. without this i’d go straight for junk.


5. journaling honestly at night
i started writing what i felt and what triggered my eating. no filters. not every night, but often. it helped me understand myself more than any diet app ever did.


6. not labeling foods “bad”
as soon as i stopped calling pizza or chocolate “bad”, i stopped bingeing on them. when you know you can have it, you don’t feel the need to lose control.


7. showing up even on shitty days
this one’s the most important. some days i ate too much or skipped workouts. but i kept showing up. no starting over. just continuing. and slowly, it worked. i’ve lost 18kg so far. not fast, but for the first time it feels permanent.

Wife and I did a kid free trip to Epic today. Showed up at 10:00 for an 11:00 opening. Valet was slick. Grabbed a coffee and wandered around Celestial Park until they let people into the rest of the areas at about 10:50. 

Highlights! Stardust Racers was the bomb. Super fun, would do again. Berk was pretty cool, and the animatronics were top notch. Dark Universe blew away my expectations. The theming everywhere you look is amazing, the designs are really impressive. 

Everything seemed the opposite of how I imagined it. I thought the Potter areas was going to be awesome, I was disappointed. I thought I was going to not care about Dark Universe... totally wrong. I thought Mario was going to disappoint... Nope, it was great, but if you subtract the DK area man is it small. 

I think the most disappointing things were, according to Thrill Data, today should have been at about 1/4 of the capacity they're planning for the summer. But queue times were still 45-90 minutes. The only ride that was consistently delayed was MoM, which is great... but Frankenstein being at 90 minutes when there's only 4000 tickets sold for today was eye opening. The park ""felt"" pretty empty as we walked around, until we looked at the ride and food queues. 

Speaking of food, same problem. There are a TON of sit down dining opens. Which is great, but we didn't want to blow an hour of our limited time there (we could only stay about 6 hours) sitting down for a meal. All of the snack stands that had anything except for pretzels and popcorn had a huge line. The cone place in Berk, the tavern in Dark Universe, etc. Massive waits in the direct sun. 

Speaking of direct sun. IMO, picture the worst shaded theme park you can think of. Now take away more shade. Serious lack of umbrellas, overhangs, trees, anything to keep you out of the sun. I don't envy people who are going in July and August. They're going to bake. 

Speaking of baking... no, not really. But that sums it up for us. We might go back one more time this year to see if we have a different experience. Otherwise when we left we agreed that if they do add it as a 4th park option for passholders in 2026, we probably won't bother and we'll just buy a ticket once a year, maybe.

I have a history of restrictive eating disorders and was so upset and worried I'd backslide into restrictive habits now that certain foods were ""bad"" again.

I talked to my doctor and a dietician, and they were both super encouraging and helpful and made it clear that it wasn't a huge deal and I didn't have to overhaul my diet, just be a little more mindful and try to cool it on sweets, eat more whole grains and protein, etc.

Anyway, I made a lot of very small changes. I used to eat white rice every day (I'm Asian) and I kept eating rice but switched to brown rice. I switched from white bread to whole wheat, and I started putting sugar-free vanilla syrup in my coffee every morning instead of sugar. I cut out sugary sodas and juice and stopped snacking on chips and candy all the time and started snacking on things like string cheese, mixed nuts, fruit, and veggies. And I started walking for 30-60 minutes every evening.

tbh I'm actually kind of shocked that my A1C came down. I thought I was being ""bad"" because I'll still have dessert a few times a week (usually ice cream but sometimes a cookie or donut or something). Sometimes I eat sugar cereal or a toaster waffle for breakfast, although I try to stick with things like whole grain toast with peanut butter. I still eat fast food maybe twice a week, and once a week I get 50% sweet boba tea as a treat.

I did lose 10 lbs from making the small changes I did, and I feel healthier and stronger from regular exercise and eating better foods most of the time.

Anyway! Just wanted to post this as a data point in sometimes you don't have to make huge changes. Just small changes can add up to better health over time, and you might still be able to have the treats you love sometimes.",14,1746141501.0,prediabetes,2,0.95,False

(warning tear jerker),"I hobble along the narrow metal path that smells of old boots and lemon polish, letting the deck’s gentle hum steer my pace.  The humans call this place hydroponics—a hard word that rustles in their mouths like dry leaves—but to me it is simply the corridor that tastes of wet earth and warm light.  Whenever the door slides open, a green breeze slips out and tickles my nose with promises of fresh lettuce.  I pause just long enough to soak it in, then shuffle onward, claws clicking like loose bolts.

My ears twitch with every pulse of the ship’s heart.  I have counted that rhythm for twenty-seven seasons of stars, and though the beat has quickened and slowed with upgrades I never understood, it is still the same lullaby that cradled me as a pup tucked in Captain’s jacket.  Back then I floated— all paws and wonder—while little Aster snagged my tail and giggled me back to her side.  Her laugh tasted like sunrise.

A turn, another turn—nose is better than eyes these days—and there it is: the round window no taller than a man’s leg, hidden behind crates that smell of machine grease and cinnamon ration bars.  My place.  I nudge the mat that has molded itself to my shape, circle until the spinning in my head calms, and sink onto its frayed softness.  The window swallows half the wall, spilling cold starlight across my paws.  Outside, rivers of white fire stretch forever, but they glitter softer tonight, like the hush before dreamland.

I shut my eyes, and pictures drift up the way bacon scent used to drift through the galley vents.

There—the first roar that cracked earth open beneath us.  Everyone was strapped down; I was zipped inside Captain’s coat.  My tiny heart hammered so loud the woman laughed and pressed her hand over me, and I decided her heartbeat could drown rockets.

There—the long tunnel where gravity forgot us.  A blue ball floated past, smelling of rubber and Aster’s sticky sweets.  I chased, paddling air.  The ball bounced off a wall and back into my teeth; the crew cheered as if I were a hero, not a pup gripped by surprise.

There—the night the red lamps flashed and thunder crawled across the hull.  Aster hid beneath her blankets, shivering like a leaf.  I wormed inside, molding my body to hers until her quakes slowed.  I didn’t know the danger’s name, only that my girl needed a heartbeat steadier than her own.

My tail thumps once against the mat, a final salute to those memories.  It’s harder now—the tail, the breathing, the thinking.  But the metal floor is warm, and a thin beam of light lands across my muzzle like Captain’s old hand.

Footsteps echo far away.  Aster’s.  She’s taller, voice deeper, but I still know the cadence that used to read bedtime tales about brave pups and brighter planets.  I try to lift my head.  It rises a whisker, slides back down.  The deck vibrates; engines waking, perhaps.  Doesn’t matter.  I already feel the soft drift of sleep rolling in, thick as the blankets Aster hid under.

Smells blur into one gentle perfume: green air from the plant room, sharp metal, ghost of coffee.  They twine together and wrap around my ribs.  My paws twitch—once, twice—rehearsing a run that no longer needs solid ground.

The ship’s hum deepens.  My ears lay flat; sound sinks into silence.  I catch the faintest note of lavender—Aster’s doing—and the dark behind my eyes blooms purple and gold.  I follow it, step by slow step, until the corridor widens into soft grass I’ve only ever seen on screens.


---

Aster’s sandals slap the deck.  “Apollo?  Biscuit time!”  She peeks into storage, Engineering, the warm nook by the reactor.  A teasing grin fades when no claws answer.

The little window chamber.  She slips inside.

A corgi lies curled on a threadbare mat, russet coat brushed silver by distant suns.  One ear is folded just so, as if still listening.

Aster sinks to her knees.  Her fingers tremble over the white blaze between his ears, half hoping for the lift of a breath.  None comes.  Starlight catches in her tears, turning them to tiny comets.

“Took your quiet spot again, didn’t you?” she whispers, voice cracking.  She gathers him—lighter than she remembers—presses him close, and feels the faint warmth that lingers like a final heartbeat echo.

Outside, a lone meteor burns a rainbow path across black.  She imagines stubby legs sprinting after it, tail a banner of joy, and the thought brings a shaky smile.

“Good run, old boy,” she says, and the ship seems to breathe in agreement, carrying the words into every vent and corridor—the story of a small steadfast heart that outlived engines and storms, and now runs where no leash can reach.

Somewhere beyond the hull’s thin skin, past boosters and nebulae, a corgi waits on sunlit grass, ears perked, ready once more to race the girl whose laugh tasted like sunrise.

My honest take is that it's not good. But it's also not bad. It's like tofu. Kindof meh.

To me it tasted weakly like over roasted coffee beans. A bit of a bitter aftertaste. Tried it raw first, then dipped in sesame oil, then dipped in soy sauce and finally with the mustard pack it came with. Soy sauce was the best, but honestly the white rice I prepared with sesame seeds had more flavor.

I didn't expect them to be so soft, texture reminded me of wet popcorn or a wet marshmallow. I did make a mess with all the strings, napkin definitely required.

It's a super food, but all that plastic styrofoam it comes in ought to cancel that out.

First my ex wife (47f) whom I divorced 18 years ago, asking if I’d like to meet in Miami (my home base) I said yes but then it turned from “let’s have a coffee” to “can I stay with you?” to which I politely declined. She is recently divorced with 3 kids. 

Then my first intimate girlfriend ever (f45) whom I dated 26 years ago (college) messages me that she agreed to have an open relationship with her husband and thought of me (!!). She also has 2 kids from the previous marriage. I politely declined but she has since divorced and is adamant on us meeting in Sweden this summer. 

Finally another girl (f36) I dated 10 years ago has been texting me wanting to meet and see if we can rekindle (lives in Italy). She never married, no kids. We have spoken the most but she seems just as immature as she was back when we dated. 

Should I take it as a compliment? It’s so strange to me. I must say, I am single (divorced), no kids and have done well…I am semi retired and have dual residences in Miami and Cabo San Lucas which I go back and forth at will. I am very into fitness as well. I don’t think it’s about money, perhaps safety? Better someone they already know than dating at their age: 36f no kids, 45f 2 kids (she is very wealthy), 47f 3 kids.  

I am not going to pursue any of them, the past is better kept shut…but, is the dating market so bad women are considering old partners nowadays?

Of course you can take apart a ""smart button"" and use it as a binary sensor (input) or a Zigbee switch as a relay (output), but is there a general-purpose board/module which has both independent inputs and outputs (at least one of each) and can read or track the input state, like a very primitive microcontroller GPIO?

Many Zigbee relay modules also have a switch function for a mechanical light switch, which maybe could be used as a binary sensor, but it's usually linked to the relay. Some have a ""detached mode"" (like the recent Sonoff thingy) but it's janky in Home Assistant, and the Sonoff relay only switches the 230V mains anyway, which would be deadly for controlling low-voltage logic...

For context: A very simple application would be controlling the power button of a coffee maker to remotely start the warm-up/cleaning procedure. The Zigbee board simply has to read the state of the power LED (high/low) for status indication and short (or pull up/down) the power button for a few seconds to turn the power on/off. It doesn't need any current handling and could be powered from the internal 5V or 12V DC supply. There are countless similar applications for adding remote and ""smart"" functionality to dumb devices just by reading binary states and shorting switches to emulate button presses. I know I could do that with a proper microcontroller which has a Zigbee radio module, but I can't possibly be the first one to come up with this kind of application, so surely there must be an existing GPIO solution, right?",0,1746140340.0,homeassistant,0,0.5,False
