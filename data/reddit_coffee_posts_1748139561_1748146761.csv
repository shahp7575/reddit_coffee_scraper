I’m 22 and currently the only one in my house (shared with 3 other women) who owns and knows how to use firearms. I already have a SIG P365 that I carry daily and keep by my bed at night.

We get a lot of unwanted male attention being young and, frankly, all very attractive. Over the past year:
	- I’ve had men try to follow me home (from the grocery store and coffee shop, I don’t even go to bars)
	- One of my roommates still has an active stalker 
	- We’ve all had men harass or touch us in public without consent
      - My creepy drunk neighbor is always asking us to sleep with him and he followed one of us on our run today around the neighborhood. He’s ALWAYS harassing us (yes we have reported to police many times)

Today, I had another unsettling incident…two men came up behind me on an escalator and touched me in public, completely unprovoked. It really shook me.

I’m now wondering:
Should I buy a second gun specifically for home defense since we have had many incidents both at the house and out in public? Would it be smarter to get something larger and more powerful for that role, or is my P365 sufficient? I know you technically only use one firearm at a time, but I want to be prepared.

Any suggestions or advice on what kind of second firearm (if needed) would be best for this situation would be really appreciated. I just really am scared sometimes and would like advice :/ Thank you! ",1,1748146608.0,Firearms,0,1.0,False
1kutvjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1kutvjp/dhammapada_331/,Dhammapada #331,"This morning, as my 30 mile psychedelic mushroom cycle came to an end, I received a message from a woman whom I haven't interacted with in over three months. 

When I read the message, I felt the negative energy from this woman pass via text. 

As I made my way home, I started to shake. The negativity made me ill. When I made it home, I made myself comfy, made breakfast and sat on the kitchen table with my protein pancake and coffee in front of me when I decided to respond. 

Before I responded, the Buddhist teachings came to mind. When I responded, I had two options; respond in the same manner, or, be better. 

As the woman kept sending me nasty negative messges, she said to me: ""you should look in the mirror"". 

I said: ""I always do. When I look in the mirror, I se a new person. I see a person who is happy and content with life. I may not have it all. But at the same time, I have it all. You can't buy happiness, and that I have. "" 

The lady goes on to say: ""I'm glad your happy"". 

When I made it to work, I told my friend all about the nasty woman. After our interaction, I read Dhammapada when I came across verse #331 which reads: 

""Happiness is having friends when need arises. Happiness is contentment with just what one has. Happiness is merit at the end of one's life. Happiness is the abandoning of all suffering.""

Man was I in shock! What a coincidence if you ask me. This is why I enjoy the Buddhist practice!

I didn't need the Buddhist practice to learn these things. I teach myself these things every day through personal life experiences. The Buddhist practice justifies my personal beliefs and self taught teachings! 

My interaction with my friend from work than inspired this following quote:

"" I may not be rich, but I'm rich in happiness"".

Ive had very few actual relationships and such, and don't find myself frequently looking for any type of relationship, i never have, as up until i was about 20 years old i wad by no means what the populous would consider 'attractive' though that seems to have changed based on unwarranted interactions, i can say my confidence and style better and much more... me.
Even outside of that i guess I've felt particular about who i trust or even think maybe attractive and stuff, and like. What type of attractive because i have catagories and it depends heabily.
Anyway
I am a hair stylist and have been in the area since the beginnikg of 2021 when i moved to the city.
There is a local coffee shop down the street that is really good, and I would go to occasionally. 
For some reason I started to visit more frequently at some point in the last 1-2 years. Like going once a week, to a couple times a week. Becoming a regular cause i was making mpre money 
Theres one guy that works there that I always thought of as that 'Cute older Barista that always fills my lattes real full'and by older i mean, i would guess at the latest hes mid 30's.
Well, like I said im a hair stylist, and id noticed he was growing his hair out some, and its short snd a little wavy/curly but hed wear a hat a lot so itd be flatted and such, but as it was growing out the ends are curling out more and stuff and its just cute okay?
But he's got like a little bit of grey in his facial hair that seems to be shaven fairly short usually, and in his curls and i find myself looking when hed be turned around or making drinks and cant see me. 
Well
The start of the year its like things have changed some? 
I started coming in enough (and getting the same thing enough) that everyone there usually knows what i want when i come in, and around April i found out id have to move and figure out a new job situation,  so for about a month i hadnt been in, as i was trying to make sure I'd save money.
Then I come back, snd its all colorful snd refreshed
And he made my drink and.. actually like talked to me, he complimented my hair and asked if it had been like that for a while, so i explained to him about the situation and fresh hair is a good first impression and such.
Then the next time he see's me he's asking me about the job situation and everything,  and then he started.
Catching me
Watching him
We'd end up making full on wye contact for a moment before im awkwardly looking at the menu as if im going to order something different. 
Then
When it'd happen he'd give me a little wave and smile,  and like, usually he seems pretty neutral/stoic when hes working snd such, which i get it, same,
He also looks incredibly tired every time i see him which like, also i get it, also same.
But it just seemed very apparent of a change to have him giving me the stupid little smile and it made me just go hdudhehxikfhdusjd and want to scream inside a little bit??????
Its usually busy and i dont like holding baristas hostage so we dont have super long conversations, but we've just suddenly started having more interactions and as soon as that started happening its like my brain gets a little stupid and i dont know what to do?
I was moving salons and recently like. Casually gave a few business cards to him and mentioned discounts for local workers because his hair is lowkey getting frizzy and started to look kinda like a mess and i want. To help him. And talk to him. 
But ive also being in a kiosk, and in a previous salon where i was forced to sit in the big window station and sit right up in the front because 'it looks good and brings people in(to see a pretty young girl in the window)' which both, caused a lot of creepy guys coming snd harassing me.
And i dont want to be weird, or be that harasser, but also if i were to be wrong snd like??? He has a fuckikg family and kids or some dumb shit i would absolutely die wnd never recover. Id have to wait until afternoon when hed gone to get my coffees.
But hes asking me about my motorcycle cause i had a creepy altercation when i was parking which lead to me not being able to drop my helmet off snd bringing it in which like. I guess bonus points because now he knows im certified cool motorcyle goth. Minus a few bonus points because when he saw my helmet and asked i realized it was odd id of brought it in as i park near my work snd had to explain what happend and he looked. Oh so concerned for me. Reasonably so. But still. He keeps chatting and talking to me so like clearly its not weird we're accidentally giving eachother looks even though im getting the feeling he realized i was getting a little embarassed when i realized he was catching me looking because he  still greets me but ive noticed what feels like a lookikg around and a not so casual side glance at my direction, which made me go 'fuck is it really that obvious when someone does that..'
Oh my gosh i could keep going im going to stop i need to stop. I've gone from 0-2 times a week to like. 2‐4 days a week im getting coffee there in the mornings ahxuxhdbdidn",1,1748146178.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

In late 2024, I had a three-hour layover in Munich. I was alone, eating dinner, and thinking about how much time I’d wasted in airports that year. I’d taken around 60 flights for work and leisure. That felt like a lot, but some of my friends, especially those in sales, fly much more.

I sometimes try to work, code, or read. But let’s be honest — getting anything done in an airport isn’t easy. I started wondering: how many people like me are sitting in airports right now, looking for something meaningful to do?

That’s when the idea struck me — what if there was something in between Tinder and YC’s Co-Founder Matching to build business connections during travel? An app that connects airport business professionals based on their shared interests in the airport.

She was from a lower middle class family and we are from middle class family, but somehow could never meet her expectations. My mistake was car loan that ate 30% of my salary, a car that i took for my love so that she and me can keep her nose high in her family as it was intercaste.

Eventually, I couldnt manage expenses and she got frustated from me and since we were living with parents, she got more frustated to make food beforr goin to and after office. Was never into our physcial relationship and also we regularly kept travelling due to office so always trusted each other. Expectations not met like dinners, coffees, shoppings, she stopped talking to me for days,creepy silenece always. Once she slapped me so hard cz i had messaged my frnd that she looked hot in one pic pose. i checked her phone that had pics of office guys in vest, she still said nothing is there. I slapped her back and turned her away more. 

But 1 day i traced her that she went with her boss to different location national and not what she told me. There was no earth below me. I confronted her and she said there is nothing. Still never called me when she travelled. Things turned bad and stopped talking for months. I was not meeting her expectations so I couldnt respond to it.  I never distrusted her after that as well. She kept cursing my parents n me but still somehow i lived the marriage. Always tried to make up with whatever i had, but failed. Allowed her to spend,never asked for money. She refrained from goin to our family functions but all ok for her side family function. I eventually spit on her andspoiled marriage even more.

. Never in my marriage I had cheated her till then. But always told God pls if she cheats, i also should be allowed to cheat. If not cheating, use all forces to stop me from cheating. One day out of the blue, she said lets have baby as my brother just had one. I was lonely for 5 years, with creepy silence all around me i agreed, and couldnt ask families to help set her mindset as her father had two bypass surgeries already. 

And eventually I met a babe hungry for physical. Still I always repeating to myself the same if she cheats phrase. But I eventually gave in.

But parallely had child with wife. Everything looked ok she n i were happy,families happy. She Always had been a great mother, nurtured the child well for years. No physical ever came back between us . She had a office male colleague that i trusted and she is regularly in touch with him till now. We even went to a family outing with that colleague family.in my years of marriage never met my friends for beer. She never wanted to get into or talk about solving our physical part. Nad ofcourse no sex as dried as famine. That babe also moved away whem she got to know wife was pregnant.

However sometime back,i again traced her going cabs to different hotel rather than office and again same things all is ok. Confronted and asked if still sleeping with ex boss or office male colleague, she couldnt answer as she was shocked i checked her phone over night. She now supports me wuth money, and we now live separetly from parents but totally dependent on them for child in noon. 

She was away on our child birthday due to official work, and didnt even call him to pacify him and make him sleep. Only 5mim birthday cake cut time. But I traced that she was talkimg to another man at night 11.30pm on same birthday night for 40min. 

 One of my ex gf recently contacted me, but i didnt go to her. She had earler rejected me as she was from upper middle class and married someone else. She shaid she is very sorry for her behaviour but this time i didnt go back to her as she is into high end luxury stuff and I didnt want to hurt my self esteem again. i also had a sexbomb friend near office, but only met her twice frankly. i wanted her emotional and phyiscal support but she denied both as she said she had no feelings.

My child is everything to me and i dont love wife at all, totally distrusted. Will i be able to revive marriage or what should i do?",2,1748145837.0,survivinginfidelity,1,1.0,False

After high school I moved out of state for college. I always kept in touch with my best friend Anna and we kept each other informed about guys we were seeing and all that stuff. After college (about 6 months ago) I moved back to my home state but an hour away from my hometown. About a month ago I decided, since I was settled finally, to start getting back into the dating game so I joined Tinder.

Instantly I met this really awesome guy named John. It turns out that John was up in my part of the state for work but that he actually lives in my hometown. I started to realize that he looked familiar and ask if we went to elementary school together or if he attended my church as a kid. He said he just moved to the state a couple years ago and I chalked it up as him having ""one of those"" faces.

We started chatting and hit it off pretty quickly. I told him I wasn't big into social media and he said he wasn't either so we exchanged numbers and started texting to communicate. Even though he lived an hour away he commutes to my town a lot for work and since neither of us were looking for anything serious we figured this was a pretty awesome set up. After a while our conversations turned a bit sexual with some sexy pics being sent from his side and comments about hooking up when he came back. We set up a date to have lunch and meet when he got back.

During this time I had told Anna all about him and when I finally told her we were going to meet up she asked for a picture. I sent her one (not one of the sexy ones, obviously) and was surprised to find out that she had dated him for a short time (couple of weeks) a few years back. I asked if she was okay with me seeing him and she said she didn't care but that she was positive he had a girlfriend. She sent me his full name so I could find him on Facebook and sure enough he was in a relationship. I was pissed.

I instantly sent him a message confronting him. He apologized and profusely and said it was a mistake to talk to me on Tinder. I told him he should be apologizing to his girlfriend which he begged me not to tell. I told him to fuck off and blocked his number.

After that I screenshot all the messages we had sent including him admitting to his guilt and sent his girlfriend a Facebook message. I told her I felt awful for having even a small role in his potential infidelity and that I thought she should know. I haven't gotten a message back and I don't think I will. But I felt what I did was the right thing to do.

Fast forward to a couple days ago when I came back home and went out for lunch with Anna. She asked me what ending up happening with John and I told her. She instantly got furious and started saying stuff like I had ""no business interfering with another person's relationship"" and ""how could I destroy a relationship I wasn't part of."" I got really defensive and told her that he made me part of their relationship when he tried to cheat on his girlfriend with me. She told me I was disgusting and an awful person for what I did and that I had no business messaging John's girlfriend then paid and left. She hasn't talked to me since.

I feel like I did the right thing but the way Anna reacted and how she refuses to talk to me anymore is making me question everything. Was I right to get involved and message his girlfriend? How can I get Anna to talk to me again?

TL;DR: Met a guy on Tinder, turns out he had a girlfriend, message his girlfriend with screenshots and told her, best friend thinks I shouldn't have meddled and that I'm awful for doing so and won't talk to me. Did I do the right thing? How do I get my best friend to talk to me again?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**brutusclyde**

>Is it possible that she knows the girlfriend, and she's afraid that she's gonna get dragged into it?  Maybe he was in the same relationship when he and Anna dated, and she's afraid of being found out.  Or maybe she knew about his infidelity and didn't say anything, and she thinks the girlfriend is going to be pissed when she finds out? 

>I don't know, but it's pretty clear there's some backstory here, and I bet it's the (non-romantic) relationship between Anna and the girlfriend.

**OOP**

>>That's a good shout. I never thought she could have a relationship with the girlfriend. I remember her vaguely talking about John and seeing his pictures, which is why he looked so familiar, but I don't ever remember hearing more about him. I know she's adamantly against cheating so it'd be really surprising if she was hooking up with him while he was with his girlfriend...

**~**

**DRHdez**

>You did the right thing. Has Anna been involved with a guy in a relationship before? Could it be that she doesn't have the same set of moral values that you do?

**OOP**

>>No. She hates cheaters which is why I was so surprised by her answer. But she just kept saying that it was none of my business if her boyfriend decided to cheat.

**DRHdez**

[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7bkexg/update_my_best_friend_25f_thinks_i_25f_ruined_a/)  **Nov 8, 2017 (12 days later)**

I didn't think I would need to update especially after hearing nothing from John's girlfriend after the first couple of days but, here I am.

First off, thanks for the comments and PMs. I know I did the right thing and I was confused by Anna's reaction. But the support that poured in helped so much. Thank you.

Now, Anna still wasn't talking to me when my trip home came to an end so I just drove back to my city and went on about my life. She ended up calling me middle of last week and said she wanted to talk about what happened. She still believed that what I did was fucked up and she didn't approve. I asked her if she would ever tell me if she found out a future boyfriend of mine was cheating on me and she said ""Of course. But that's because I know you."" I told her I didn't see the friendship/stranger status as an excuse to let a guy be shitty to his girlfriend. After a while of back and forth with the same arguments I told her that we can agree to disagree and leave it at that. She said okay and we hung up.

After we hung up I decided to check my Facebook and low and behold there was a message from John's girlfriend in my inbox from two days before. I was kind of nervous to read it but it just said ""Are you in ________ right now?"" I replied that I wasn't and an hour later I got another message asking if I could call her and her number. I was super nervous because I had no idea what I was going to be walking into but I figured if it got too bad I could hang up and block her number.

I called her and it was a very awkward greeting and then she asked me to tell her everything that happened. I obliged and told her exactly what happened. I could tell she was crying on the other end which broke my heart and I started apologizing but she told me not to. She was grateful that I told her. Apparently John and her have been together for close to 4 years and he cheated on her a lot during the first year of being together until she found out. He promised he'd never do it again and she took him back. She said she was always really paranoid he would cheat again but he never showed signs or anything out of the ordinary.

I apologized for being the spotlight on what an ass he was. We kind of got to chatting for a while after that and after a while she switched from the depression to the anger stage and I let her vent. At the end of it all she said she was finally going to leave him, which I agreed with, and then said that if I'm ever back in town that she'd like to buy me a coffee. Which I thought was a nice gesture and I might take her up on the offer.

After the phone call I was really relieved and happy about how things turned out. I went to go text Anna to tell her but then I remembered that John's girlfriend said they were dating for 4 years. So I texted Anna and asked her when she dated John. It was two years ago. She must have known that he was dating another girl and that's why she was so fucking pissed. So a lot of you guessed right that she was his mistress for a while. I'm not going to tell John's girlfriend since she's done with him (hopefully) and doesn't need anymore heart ache. But I'm definitely going to cut Anna out of my life. And when she asks why I'll just tell her that I know about her and John.

All in all, it turned out okay for pretty much everyone involved except for John. Which is good because fuck that dude.

tl;dr: Lost a best friend but gained a possible new friend in John's ex.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Thoriel**

>Well, before cutting your friend out completely, you can respond to her text with, ""I just spoke with John's girlfriend. Did you know that he was in a relationship while you guys were together?"" How Anna responds to this would be incredibly telling. Though, if you're able, it would be best to ask this in person to see her physical reaction/not give her time to BS!

>And maybe for good measure let your friend know how grateful the girlfriend was and that you and her are going to grab coffee whenever you're next in town. It was really great what you did, I hope Anna can eventually see that and if not... Well, then yeah. Cut her out!

**OOP**

>>I said this in another comment but, I'm not so much pissed at her stance on the subject as I am the way she treated me. She said and called me some pretty awful things and then ignored my attempts to talk to her about it for the better part of a week. No apologizes for the names she called me or the things she said when she did finally talk to me. She just started the argument all over again.

>>I've done and said some pretty shitty things to her in the past but I always apologized for being out of line or taking my anger out on her. But there was no apology and I just felt like what she did isn't what best friends are suppose to do. So, for now, I'm keeping her at a distance.

1kutmux,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kutmux/any_mature_advice/,Any Mature Advice?,"I'm a 20M and was dating a 19F for 8 months. We became best friends quickly and had an amazing time together and also went on a vacation. At the 6 month mark she said she felt different about me, so we took a break and got back together. While we had that break I wanted to improve on my relationship skills. I did check-ins every so often asking if she was happy in the relationship. She always said yes, but she likes to bottle up things. I also tried showing up in a more supportive manner, like baking for her, going on coffee dates/walks, gym, helping with study and even came up with a fun cooking game we could have togther. Just anything to deepen the connection with her.

I left to go visit family interstate and before I left I spent lots of time with her and she seemed genuinely happy. After returning she told me she doesn't see a future with me. I unfortunately fainted and urinated myself upon hearing this (later found out I have a fear of abandonment).

Long story short 4 weeks ago she broke up with me. She didn't even want to tell me the reasons at first saying ""it didn't matter now"". I told her if she wants to end things lets put everything on the table. These are the reasons:
1) Emotional mismatch, she said she didn't love me and I felt more like a friend to her as I did not support in the ways which she needed me to. I was confused by this and said to her that she didn't mention how I can support her to feel loved and she said ""I shouldnt have to tell you this, you should know"" as I'm her partner
2) Her feeling overwhelmed, this likely came from my lack of relationship tools and understanding that intensity of love (doing all the extra things) is not the same as emotional attunement.
3) Bottling up, she brought up issues from months ago which I had no shot at correcting now as unspoken issues lead to resentment
4) Impact vs Intent, she brought up that she hated when I talked about her body (we both work out a lot). My intent of complimenting her by saying that abs are amazing or her arms are huge had the impact of hurting her. She told me she didn't like it but in a playful tone, me thinking it's going along with the joke.
5) Struggling to manage her independence with the relationship.

I was in shock at the day of the break up because of how stern she was about breaking up and she was also pretty emotionally checked out. She acknowledged she needs to work on her communication and me on accountability and impact vs intent.

I reached out to her 2.5 weeks into the break up as I went to therapy and found out I had a fear of abandonment. She replied she is happy I got help but she didn't want to talk to me then. So, I said that's fine I respect her need  for space. She reacted to this with a thumbs up emoji....

Can reconciliation happen after acknowledging and working on flaws? Is it worth it to reach out again? Because I find it tragic that we had something so good but a lack of understanding and communication prevented it from going forward.",1,1748145663.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

—————————————————-


Part 9 – Echo Doctrine
The leak didn’t come from Earth.

It came from within the galaxy.

A fragment of data—tiny, incomplete, heavily encrypted—appeared on the darkstream’s underground commercial networks, buried beneath dozens of layers of anonymization. It was tagged with just two words:

Echo Doctrine.

No one knew who posted it. No one was sure it was real.

But it spread like a gravitational wave through underground channels—reaching every intelligence agency, conspiracy forum, and armchair pundit hungry for answers.

The file contained not so much a blueprint as an outline of strategic principles:

Intentional silence.

Tactical stealth.
Psychological disruption is not about attack, but about retreat.

It describes a theory that engagement is a sign of weakness—and that true power comes from absence.

You don’t respond when the enemy escalates.

You erase your presence… until the entire battlefield collapses under the weight of expectation.

It sounds crazy.

But… it fits.

Across the stars, military intelligence agencies—some biological, some AI, and even strange hybrids—compare that data to samples of Terran text.
The rhythm. The formatting. The sentence structure.
It all matches.
Too perfectly.

The Intergalactic Council denies it, of course.
They declare it a hoax—psychological warfare unleashed by extremist groups.
But quietly, the defense budget begins to swell.
Research into stealth technology is given absolute priority.
“Silence” was reclassified—no longer a passive stance, but an active threat.

Because the doctrine didn’t say, “Wait until you’re provoked.”

It said, “Let them provoke themselves.”

And that’s exactly what happened.

Small border skirmishes turned into protracted wars with no clear initiator.

Races that had never fought before began mobilizing their fleets in advance, with the rationale:

“Prevent the possibility of humanity’s rise.”

No one wanted to be the first target.

Some began to mimic Earth’s retreat tactics.

The Marn Alliance sealed off three entire regions, naming them “Reflection Zones.”
No entry. No explanation.

The Vakari state cut off diplomatic contact for the standard six months, citing “philosophical rebalancing.”
The Velarians—who were considered the most open and transparent species in the galaxy—suddenly conducted an audit of all communications protocols that Earth had ever touched.

The galaxy began to shrink.

But the leak…didn’t stop there.

Attached to the original Echo Doctrine file was an even more sinister appendix:

A human theory.

A psychological breakdown.

They called it:
“The Noise Spiral.”

According to this theory, civilizations that depended on constant feedback loops—economic, political, social—would collapse without reliable signals.

The void didn’t inspire peace.

It invited paranoia.

Conversations turned to echoes.
Trusts rotted under the pressure of uncertainty.

And when that happened?
Earth… didn’t have to do anything.

They just had to wait.

Some galactic historians still debate whether the leak was real or staged.

Others whisper that it was never a leak at all—it was a seed, planted by Earth at the right time, in the right place, in the right mind.

A controlled spread of memetics.

But what really creeps people out?

That it worked.

Because once a doctrine had a name, it became a script.

And the galaxy—hungry for structure—began to play along.

Diplomats stalled.

Generals stopped making public appearances.

Civilizations that had shared too much now muted themselves, thinking it was a smart move.

Because Earth had done it first.

Only… no one understood what the end goal was.

Because the Echo Doctrine was not a guide.
It is a mirror.

And as all factions rush to follow what they believe is Earth’s plan,
no one stops to ask:

“What if this isn’t the plan?”

“What if this is a retreat from something… they saw coming?”

Because silence can be strategic.

But it can also be…
fear masquerading as reason.

Part 10 – The Last Memories
You are now orbiting the ruins of the Icaron Treaty Archives—once the galaxy’s largest diplomatic archive.
Twelve kilometers of rotating memory, layered in transparent alloy tubes, resonating with interdimensional bandwidth.
It was built by a coalition of twenty races, but its primary custodians are… humans.

After the Earth fell silent, it was not destroyed.

It was not attacked.

It was simply… silent.

A group of Sularian librarians attempt to restore access.
They activate the master index, requesting a list of past negotiations.
What they get instead are… stories.

Human stories.

Childhood memories.
Bits about stubborn diplomats and… broken coffee makers.
Jokes that didn’t translate but still made the crew laugh.

Confidences that never made it into the official record—only whispered in the hallways after a long, exhausting meeting.

It was as if the archives themselves had chosen the memories they wanted to keep.

And none of them were about power.

They were all about people.

Small, seemingly insignificant moments.
Stories that civilizations forgot to tell—until it was too late.

Those stories were the ones that lasted.

And that was the moment many began to understand… what Earth had left behind wasn’t technology.

Not strategy.

But… memories.

The Terran treaties were never just signatures on paper or data etched into quantum drives.
They were living relationships, webs of emotions and compromises, spoken and unspoken.
And now those connections are being exploited—twisted by factions desperate to regain influence.

Old treaties are being dug up from the ashes, misquoted, turned into weapons.

The Cephari claim that Earth once promised exclusive mining rights to the moons of Jandor—a “treaty” mentioned only once, at a cocktail party, now “legal.”

The Yel’Tak quote a line from a Terran novel as “binding arbitration language.”
The Kurns use a poem by a Terran diplomat as a justification for military intervention.

Words become bullets.
Memories become ammunition.

No one can argue.
Because Earth… doesn’t answer.

So each race fills the silence with its own interpretation of what Earth “means.”
And the interpretations grow more extreme.
More and more absurd.

And more and more dangerous.

One rebel faction even claimed:
Earth never existed.
Humanity as a whole is a myth—a moral propaganda campaign taken too far.

They attacked a human memorial planet to prove their point.

But they were crushed not by force, but by...

a song.

A sad melody. Gentle as a lullaby.
Recorded in dozens of Earth languages.
Broadcast in all directions.

Soldiers dropped their weapons.
Some cried.
Some knelt and whispered:

“They remember us... better than we remember ourselves.”

Even the most hardened skeptics sensed something in that moment:
Earth left something more powerful than presence.

Emotion.

And emotion, when it is no longer tied to its original source, can become a storm.

Governments rushed to issue official statements.

“We do not condone the distortion of Terran intentions,” one ambassador said, his voice trembling.

But it was too late.

You cannot shut a galaxy out of emotion.

Especially when it remembers a race that once led the emotional dimension of space.

And that was Earth’s ultimate, untraceable weapon…

Not silence.

Not the space scarecrows.

But…

The memory they left behind.

Part 11 – When the Stars Blink
The war didn’t start with an armada.

It started with a blink.

Twelve stars, spread across five galactic regions, dimmed by exactly 0.07%.
For eight seconds.
At the same time.

Astronomers scrambled for explanations—solar dust storms, gravitational lensing, quantum interference from free particles.
It all made sense.
It was all wrong.

Because the same thing happened… again.
Two cycles later.
Same stars.
Same dimming.
Same eight seconds.

Only this time… something happened afterward.

The light didn’t return.

The stars were still shining—but dimmer.
Not dead. Not collapsed.
Simply… quieter.

And with them, every relay station, every navigation signal, every ship that navigated by the radiation fields from those stars was lost.
Thousands of ships drifted.
Some collided.
Trade routes disappeared.
Navigation algorithms panicked and collapsed.

At first there was panic.
Then… realization.

This wasn’t natural.

This was a signal.

Those stars had been used extensively by humans for navigation—as reference points for their earliest star-engine systems.
Not because they were special.

But because… they were aesthetically symmetrical.

Humans liked triangles.
Liked circles.
Liked scheduling diplomatic meetings around days they considered “unlucky.”

And now, those very stars… were blinking.

Some called this phenomenon the Solar Shroud.
There were whispers of an “ancient Terran preservation mechanism”—long theorized but never confirmed.

A way to dim the night without breaking anything.

To make the galaxy feel a little more lost.

And it worked.

Because after the third dimming, ships began turning.

Cargo ships refused certain routes.
Pilots crossed out maps.
Civilians canceled flight zones entirely, citing “navigation instability.”

One planetary system even had to rewrite the laws of time, as their atomic clocks—once calibrated to those stars—began to lose their rhythm.

But you know what was the final blow?

Earth said nothing.

Not a word.
Not a warning.
Not a “sorry we darkened half your sky.”

Because… they didn’t have to.

This wasn’t punishment.

This was proof.

Proof that Earth could still touch the galaxy whenever they wanted—without crossing a single border.

And that shattered the last remnants of interstellar certainty.

You see, the Cold War was never about weapons.

Not really.
It was about capabilities.
About the ability to act.

About the quiet tension that kept everyone polite.

Earth had removed that tension—by withdrawing from the game.

But now?

Now they showed that silence didn’t mean absence.

It meant omnipresence.

And that forced everyone to admit what they had long avoided:

They never really understood Earth.

Didn’t understand their technology.
Not understanding their strategy.
Not understanding their patience.

And most of all, not understanding their silence.

Because no one else had the patience to wait that long—without responding.

That required discipline.
That required intentionality.
That required a species that had spent centuries debating whether to put pineapple on pizza.

The council met again—what was left of it.
Fewer voices.
More shadows.
The minutes of that meeting were never published.
But everyone knew what they discussed.

Not retaliation.
Not diplomacy.

Just…

“What’s next?”

Because the stars were fading.
The galaxy was blinking.
And Earth?

Earth was still watching.

# From Coast to Coast to Coast

Canada, a beautiful country with a nebulous identity. Some forty-one million people try to answer the question of what it means to be Canadian. There is little common ground between the wheat farmer just north of Moose Jaw and the painter in Mile End. Yet they call themselves the same name, love the same coffee in the morning, and taste an air they'd both call uniquely Canadian. A comfortable status quo is waning, and little stands in its way. The dream is crumbling, and the country scrambles to find what might be left behind in its wake. No matter what it is, it will be faced together; unity, nevertheless, is as transient as the short first spring, cut short by the second snowfall of the year.

In the midst of this quotidian life on the precipice, whispers of a conspiracy drift from locale to locale, the tiniest dredges of substance keeping them afloat. A murder suspect here, a robber there, whispering about a renewal, about *something*. Second-, third-hand reports all contradicting one another. Some say there is a new world coming. Some say that this one will grow stronger. Some say something else, and others spin yet another story. Few are talking about it, but those who are call it everything under the sun. There's a school of thought to dismiss it all, insofar as any school exists in the first place, ridiculous nonsense some might call it. But others aren't so quick to dismiss it. With the world being pulled tauter yet by the day, there are few things that can be entirely dismissed. Even little conspiracies about murders and kidnappings, whispers of something to come. Even those have their place in the conversation.

Perhaps to simply appease these sorts in the bureaucratic chain of survival, perhaps to reassign some busybodies causing some trouble, an official investigation has been opened very quietly. Task Force 728-KH-4, a body tentatively under the oversight of the RCMP, has been charged with investigating a possible linkage between some disparate violent crimes in Canada by some movement surrounding this 'renewal'. With very little funding and even less oversight, it is not a respected body, something reflected in its skeleton crew. Composed of civilian, law enforcement, and a few unlucky military personnel, what it lacks in organisation it fails to make up for in quite literally anything else. Nobody in their right mind wants to be assigned to it. Few even know it exists. A blip in the organisational radar, cared for by nobody.

You are one of the few members of its field group component. Tasked with taking the investigation out there to the country, you are looking for proverbial needles in a pile of haystacks. Or, more accurately, whispers of what is probably nothing in the midst of an entire country. Chasing ideatic ghosts, as it were. At least the pay and benefits are decent for the civilians, and there are far more stressful assignments out there for the rest. Nevertheless, it's no secret it's the dead end for anyone's career. Still, here you are, investigating.

After all, who knows what you might find?

Thank you for reading the chronicle introduction above! What follows is OOC information about the chronicle. Please give it a read!

This is a H:tR 5e chronicle (not set in the WoD universe) that will be playing on **Sunday evenings**. This is going to be a very roleplay-heavy chronicle focusing on character and dialogue for the most part, though there may be combat depending on how the group chooses to approach different situations! It is a very player-driven chronicle, so the direction of the story will change drastically depending on your choices. Thank you for your interest in the chronicle and reading this far! To speak a little more on what this chronicle is about, it's a celebration of Canada and what it means to be Canadian, exploring the country in all its beautiful provinces and territories. It's a long-form mystery-thriller with a political slant and noir themes, so if that's up your alley, then we're in business!

In-character is in-character and out-of-character are out-of-character, but I believe this is very important to say: **there will be NO space for bigoted players at the table**. While characters may hold their own prejudices, this should never, ever be taken into the out-of-character space. Furthermore, the in-character space should not be used as a veil for bigotry either. While bigotry and bigoted characters are topics that will be explored, simply using the in-character space to direct prejudice towards another player will NOT be tolerated. I have seen this happen before, it is a no tolerance matter at my tables. Players will be removed if this occurs. That is a promise.

As this is a queer-friendly space, please respect all identities. If that is going to be an issue, do not apply for this campaign. Similarly, this is a Jewish friendly space (I myself am Jewish), so if you have problems with Jews, do not apply for this campaign. But if you're down for a queer-friendly and Jewish-friendly space, then I'm ready to rock and roll and have a good time roleplaying with you!

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._No_(film)&action=edit&section=1)\]

John Strangways, the Station Chief of [MI6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service) in [Jamaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Jamaica), is murdered, along with his secretary Mary, by a trio of assassins before his home is ransacked. After MI6 loses radio contact with the station, [James Bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrayal_of_James_Bond_in_film) is found playing baccarat in a private London club; [Sylvia Trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Trench) is one of the other players. [M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_(James_Bond)), the head of [MI7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI7), assigns Bond to go to Jamaica; Strangways was helping the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency) investigate [radio jamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_jamming_and_deception) of rocket launches from [Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station). M also confiscates Bond's Beretta handgun, which he had used for ten years, replacing it with a Walther PPK 7.65 mm. At Bond's home he finds Sylvia Trench, a brief encounter as he is on the way to his flight.

Landing in Jamaica, Bond accepts a ride from an enemy agent. He overpowers the agent, who kills himself by biting into a [cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide)\-laced cigarette. Bond arranges with principal secretary Pleydell-Smith to meet those who saw Strangways last, including Professor Dent. At Strangway's home, Bond finds a receipt from Dent and a picture of Strangways and [Quarrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarrel_(James_Bond)), who tailed Bond from the airport earlier. Bond finds Quarrel, they fight, and CIA agent [Felix Leiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Leiter) stops it, explaining that Quarrel worked with him and Strangways looking for the radio jamming source. One island, Crab Key, is generally off limits, controlled by Dr. No, with a bauxite mine; Quarrel and Strangways got rock samples at night.

Bond visits Dent, who claims the samples were iron pyrite. Dent travels to Crab Key and is given a [tarantula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula) to kill Bond. However Bond kills the spider. He arranges to meet Pleydell-Smith's corrupt secretary Miss Taro. On the drive to her home, the assassins try to run Bond off the road, but they crash and die. After an intimate interlude, Bond has Taro arrested. He waits in her home. Dent arrives to kill Bond but is killed by Bond instead.

During the night Quarrel takes Bond to Crab Key. The next morning they meet [Honey Ryder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Ryder), a shell diver. Armed guards search for them. At nightfall the group encounter a [flame tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_tank) disguised as a [dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) to deter locals, which kills Quarrel. Bond and Ryder are captured. Radioactive from the contaminated swamp, both are put through a decontamination process. Taken to comfortable suites with clothes in their sizes, they drink drugged coffee and sleep.

Upon awakening, the pair are escorted to dine with the base's owner, Dr Julius No: a Chinese-German scientist with [prosthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis) metal hands due to radiation exposure. No was a member of a Chinese [tong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_(organization)), until he stole $10 million in gold, and now works for [SPECTRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECTRE) (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion). The radio jamming will disrupt a [Project Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury) space launch at Cape Canaveral. When Bond refuses to join SPECTRE, No has Ryder taken away and Bond beaten. Bond escapes his cell through an air vent, disguises himself as a worker, and infiltrates the base's control centre.

Bond overloads the nuclear [pool reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_reactor) as the launch commences. Dr. No fights him, but falls into the reactor pool and is boiled to death. As the base's personnel evacuate, Bond frees Ryder before the two escape the island by boat, moments before the base is destroyed. Felix finds the pair adrift at sea after their boat runs out of fuel, and has them towed to safety by a [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) ship. As Ryder passionately kisses him, Bond lets go of the towrope to embrace her.",1,1748145201.0,quora,0,1.0,False

Comfort is a non-issue. If they’re top of the line protection and affordable I could genuinely care less if my toes hurt, my feet are blistered/bleeding or I walk a little funny when I go in to grab a coffee. If the can keep my feet and most of my calfs safe from road rash, breaks, fractures and dismemberment then I can handle them not being my favorite shoes to wear, I go bouldering in shoes a full size too small and I don’t mould my skates when I break them in, discomfort is not my concern. I think I am a men’s size 8 shoe I’ll be shopping around more so if that size doesn’t seem correct I’ll update it in the post. I don’t mind if they’re gently used either but they need to be gently used/like new. 

My family has major anxieties about motorcycles in general I need my equipment to be in visibly good repair and with no road rash, missing pieces, cracks or torn leather.

**Season 2 Episode 2: Halloween Night (2024)**

**Jun-Ho** sneaks into the Pink Motel and starts investigating the fourth floor when suddenly he hears screaming coming from one of the rooms. He barges it open and sees **Woo-Seok** tied up and blindfolded. He unties **Woo-Seok** and checks if he's okay. However, **Woo-Seok** screams even louder and punches **Jun-Ho** in the face as he thinks **Jun-Ho** is working for **The Salesman**. **Jun-Ho** restrains a frightened **Woo-Seok** and clarifies that he just needs to know where **Gi-Hun** is. **Woo-Seok** is hesitant to answer but the silence is interrupted by a gunshot. **Woo-Seok** runs to **Gi-Hun's** room with **Jun-Ho** following to find out the cause of the gunshot. 

**Woo-Seok** and **Jun-Ho** barge into the room where they find **Gi-Hun** standing above **The Salesman's** dead body. **Woo-Seok** runs to hug **Gi-Hun** and thanks him for killing **The Salesman**. He tells **Gi-Hun** that he killed **Jeong-Rae** with teary eyes. **Woo-Seok** moves out of the way to kick his dead body, allowing **Gi-Hun** to see **Jun-Ho** behind him once he finishes processing **Jeong-Rae's** death. **Gi-Hun** is happy to see **Jun-Ho** return to his life but the latter is a bit scared seeing that he just killed **The Salesman**. **Gi-Hun** drops his gun and hugs **Jun-Ho**, to the latter's shock.

Later that night, a guard knocks on the door of a minivan belonging to **Kang** **No-Eul**, an employee at the nearby amusement park. He scolds her for sleeping here and tells her that she is not allowed to park here at this hour and that he would get in trouble if he doesn't report her. He lets her go this time but next time he would have to fine her.

Back in the Pink Motel, **Jun-Ho** catches the other two up on his experience as a guard in the 2020 Squid Games, and what he discovered such as the guards harvesting the still alive players for organs, **VIPs** being invited every year to watch the games, and the man behind the games who wore a black mask and ultimately shot him. He doesn't **Gi-Hun** about his brother as he doesn't trust him completely and will wait until he asks to announce so. **Woo-Seok** is still wary of **Jun-Ho** and doesn't believe his story as the police have never helped them and recommends against **Gi-Hun** telling **Jun-Ho** his experience. **Gi-Hun** interrupts the bickering by asking the both of them how many more people have to die for the sake of the games? He explains the reason the games work is because they are relying on the players to betray each other, that they thrive on hatred and deceiving. **Woo-Seok** sheds a tear for his fallen friend. **Jun-Ho** thinks back to his half-brother shooting him. The latter remembers the **Captain's** advice and turns the anger into finding justice. He searches **The Salesman's** body and finds a card that reads ""October 31, Midnight, Club HDH"".

**Gi-Hun** takes the two men into another room of the motel he turned into a gun range. **Gi-Hun** shows **Jun-Ho** and **Woo-Seok** his collection of guns, which cover the walls and fill the bathtub. Picking up a gun, **Jun-Ho** questions if they work. In response, **Gi-Hun** pulls back a curtain and walks through a knocked down wall, revealing a makeshift gun-range. At the end of the man-made hallway, is a wardrobe with the symbols of a circle, triangle and square. **Gi-Hun** rapidly shoots at the targets, alarming **Woo-Seok**. He offers the space as a practice room and suggests **Jun-Ho** quits his job.

**THE NEXT DAY**

At the amusement park the next morning, **No-Eul** works as an entertainer as part of the carnival. She wears a pink bunny costume, waving to children and handing out lollipops. **Park Na-Yeon**, one of the children in the crowd, is sad as she is skipped to receive a lollipop by the pig mascot. Upon seeing this, **No-Eul** hands her one instead. In their dressing room, the entertainers complain about working in the heat. **No-Eul** stares in the mirror, unsatisfied. **Na-Yeon** opens the door to the dressing room and the workers all hurry to replace their mascot heads. She walks up to **No-Eul** and hands her a crayon drawing of herself and **No-Eul** as the bunny. As **No-Eul** responds with a heart, **Na-Yeon** asks if she is hurt upon seeing her scars on her wrist, presumably from self-harm. The man in the pig costume walks in without his mascot head on and starts to swear and complain, causing **Na-Yeon** to cry. **Na-Yeon's** father, **Park Gyeong-Seok**, calls out for her and apologises for the intrusion. After they leave, the man in the pig costume explains that **Na-Yeon** is the daughter of **Gyeong-Seok**, an artist who draws people's portraits in the park, and that she has blood cancer and is in need of a bone marrow transplant.

In the afternoon, **Gi-Hun** pays his daily ""visit"" (or rather watching from afar), to **Sang-Woo's mother** and her adopted grandson, **Kang Cheol**, the younger brother of **Kang Sae-Byeok**, a player **Gi-Hun** befriended in the 2020 Squid Games but was killed right before the final game. He sees **Cheol** running home to hug his grandmother after school and smiles.

Afterwards, he visits **Sae-Byeok's** old broker to get her mother out of North Korea. The **broker** explains to **Gi-Hun** that **Sae-Byeok's** **mother** was recently released from a prison camp in North Hamgyong Province; she never received proper treatment for her tuberculosis and will be unable to move for a while. He urges him to get her here as soon as possible to which the broker assures him that as soon as she recovers, they will. **Gi-Hun** hands him a slip of paper with the fish store's phone number on it, explaining that is where **Cheol** is, and tells him to contact them if he cannot get ahold of **Gi-Hun** himself.

As **Gi-Hun** is on his way out, he accidentally bumps into **No-Eul**, and he makes her drop and spill her coffee. **Gi-Hun** apologizes and says that he will buy her a new one. **No-Eul** replies that it's a nice gesture but won't be necessary and walks away just as **Gi-Hun** is about to convince her otherwise.

**No-Eul** arrives at the **broker's** office who enquires about finding her child, as she rejects the notion that she is dead. The broker is annoyed at No-eul's insistence as there is little evidence she is alive. She hands him an envelope of money, urging him to look for her ""one last time"". He rejects **No-Eul's** money, empathetically suggesting she should forget about her daughter.

The setting shifts to **Jun-Ho's** house where he, **Mal-Soon**, and **Captain Park** are having dinner. **Jun-Ho** informs them of who he met last night. **Mal-Soon** is horrified and says that he shouldn't stay in touch with someone who turned into a monster. **Jun-Ho** tries to argue otherwise saying that he killed for a good cause but **Mal-Soon** cuts him off by saying killing is killing, although it's a sad thought, the games definitely turned that man into a monster. **Jun-Ho** looks to **Captain Park** for backup by telling him **Gi-Hun** would aid their cause to find the island but **Captain Park** looks confused saying that they aren't looking for an island. **Jun-Ho** looks confused out of his mind and turns to his mom but she already went to get the desert.

In her car outside, **No-Eul** stares at a picture of herself, her daughter and her husband and cries. She takes out a pill bottle, empties it and swallows all the pills. A man knocks on her window, however it is not the police officer from before. She rolls down her window and the man hands her a small invitation card with the familiar three symbols on it...

As **Captain Park** is about to leave **Jun-Ho** asks if he could talk to him. Obviously, he asks about why he lied about searching for the island but he brushes it off, explaining that he didn't want to worry his mother. **Jun-Ho** remembers that after all this time, he still hasn't told his mother about their conquest but ultimately agrees with **Captain Park** about not wanting to worry her.

**THE NEXT DAY**

**Na-Yeon**, back at the carnival, looks for **No-Eul**. However, as a different entertainer is in the bunny costume, they do not give **Na-Yeon** a lollipop and doesn't acknowledge her at all. She is visibly upset by this. **No-Eul** hands in her resignation, stating she is quitting for personal reasons, thanks her employer and leaves. An ambulance drives past **Gyeong-Seok** as he is drawing and realises it's for **Na-Yeon**. **Na-Yeon**, having fallen unconscious, is taken to the hospital with her father. **No-Eul** watches the ambulance drive off and picks up the strawberry hat **Na-Yeon** was wearing that she left behind.

**Jun-Ho** stands outside of the Pink Motel, debating whether or not he should continue to help **Gi-Hun**, but ultimately decides to as it is for saving lives, what he's always dreamed of doing since he was a kid.

In the hospital, the doctor tells **Gyeong-Seok** about a new medication that may be beneficial to **Na-Yeon** as a cancer patient, however it is not yet covered by insurance. **Gyeong-Seok** insists he will get the money somehow, urging him to help his daughter. **No-Eul** arrives and enters **Na-Yeon's** room - she is unconscious and under an oxygen mask. When **Gyeong-Seok** returns, **No-Eul** is gone, but **Na-Yeon's** strawberry hat is placed on her bed.

Inside the motel, **Woo-Seok** includes a whole bunch of men he's in touch with to join their rebellion against the Squid Games and brings them to the shooting range. The three men make a plan on how to sneak into the club. They will each have earpieces to communicate with each other and hear each other's surroundings, and trackers to let each other know where they are. If any of them encounter anything to do with the games, then they will have to alert the others or drop hints. They all get in the car to drive to the club, with the men **Woo-Seok** following for protection.

Meanwhile, **No-Eul** rings the number on the card she was given and confirms her participation, sat by a fire. As she is given the details of where she will be picked up, she burns the card, and looks at the drawing **Na-Yeon** gave to her. She hesitates for a moment before throwing a fit of rage and aggressively ripping the piece of paper and burning it.

**Gi-Hun**, **Jun-Ho**, and **Woo-Seok** all enter the club, through **Jun-Ho** threatening them with a gun. They all look for suspicious signs but are so far unsuccessful, until **Gi-Hun** sees a silhouette that resembles the **Front Man**, according to **Jun-Ho's** description. However, he sees that it's a guy dressed in a grim reaper costume. **Woo-Seok**, however, has better (or worse depending on how you look at it), luck and gets cornered by a guard. The guard tasers him, making him scream, alerting the other two. **Jun-Ho** turns back to follow the direction of **Woo-Seok's** screams but gets blocked by another guard also with a taser. This time however, **Jun-Ho** starts a fist fight with this guard, causing an eruption of the crowd chanting for them to fight. **Jun-Ho** manages to escape and find **Woo-Seok's** unconscious body and quickly runs back to the car to prevent anything worse to happen to him. The previous guard who tasered **Woo-Seok** unfortunately gets **Gi-Hun** as well and loads him into a limousine.

In the limo, the **Front Man** talks to **Gi-Hun** via a golden pig. He starts off by saying he isn't going to kill him, and tells him he'd hoped **Gi-Hun** would forget everything and live a happy life and reiterates that he should've gotten on the plane. **Gi-Hun** enjoins him to stop the games, but the **Front Man** dismisses him, saying that ""The games will not end unless the world changes"". **Gi-Hun** rejects this and criticises the **Front Man's** manipulative tactics of preying on vulnerable people. **Jun-Ho** orders the gunmen to stop the limo, however both of the vans tires get shot by a sniper. With both vans gone, he attempts to follow the limo himself but unbeknownst to him, there is a bomb strapped under his car, which explodes, causing the limo to get away. Hearing this commotion over his earpiece, **Gi-Hun** pulls out a gun and tells the **Front Man** to stop the car. He shoots but the divider between the driver and the passenger seats is bullet proof. The Front Man derides his naivety, and **Gi-Hun** commands to be put back in the game. The **Front Man** questions this, but **Gi-Hun** convinces him to agree by arguing the **VIPs** who watch will be thrilled to have a previous winner return. He instructs him to take him to the games to which the **Front Man** taunts him for ""playing the hero"". **Gi-Hun** replies ""I'll show you that the world doesn't always go the way you want it to."" The **Front Man** finally agrees and gas is released, knocking **Gi-Hun** out. The last thing he sees is the **Front Man's** black mask and him welcoming him back into the game. 

**No-Eul** drives to the meeting place, exits her car and enters a shipping container on a lorry, with others doing the same. She reaches her room marked ""011"" and takes her place inside. As she puts on her mask, it is revealed that she is entering the games as a pink guard, not a player.",0,1748144858.0,squidgame,0,0.5,False

""Hey guys, look at this...""

A frail boy with thick glasses beckoned for his friends to come to where he was sitting next to the computer in the Southeastern corner of the media lab. His face had lost whatever healthy color remained of his already pale complexion. The boy stuttered, unsure. A group of large-framed teenagers approached their friend, half of them kept on with their conversation, laughing over the frivolous details, while walking.

""What's up, Tommy! Still playing the same game? You gotta stop playing so much and get a life, man, or you are going to die a virgin!"" The largest of the group placed his large, plump hands-on his friend's thin traps, ""But damn, even Frank is hooked on it. He ditched practice all the time before, but never weeks on end like this past month. Coach may come for your tiny ass, ha ha!""   

""He... did?""

Tom asked, his head slightly turned to his right shoulder, but his eyes returned to the screen without ever meeting his friend's eyes.

He wasn't sure what exactly he was looking at.

# II. TWO

Tom hated his new school, and he hated the good state of Virginia. Life was not much easier for him in Bakersfield, California, but at least he had friends he could connect with. People he could feel at ease around.

Major Tom Wendell Sr. did not give him a choice, not with a career as illustrious and promising as his. *One more promotion and I am practically guaranteed a post at the Pentagon*, the 46-year-old single father often told his boy. His wife left him not even a full year before to chase another set of uniforms with a different camo pattern, and life had not exactly been sunshine and rainbows at the Wendell household. Tom Senior threw himself into work, and whatever time he had off, he spent it to make sure his only son continued to grow well. The latter effort came in the form of weekly pizza nights, prompt PTA meetings, baseball coaching twice a month, and occasional visits to Redwood City, where the grandparents lived. Life was not picture perfect, but the Wendell men made do with what they had.

Things took an odd turn when Tom's Dad began dating this young lady from the base where he worked. Anna was only ten years older than the boy, so it made the teenager even more irate toward his dad. In truth, Tom Jr. did not have any ill feelings towards Anna. She was nice, polite, and particularly mindful toward him. He just missed his mom terribly for the most part and was angry at her husband for losing her. Anna quickly placated the boy by spending lots of time with him, sharing every hobby he had with copious enthusiasm. She even saved him from the nasty boys at school simply by showing up hooked on his arm one day, not bothered to correct the misunderstanding of a sinful mature woman enamored by boyish charms. They kept it from Dad, of course, a playful little secret between the two.

One night, during dinner a month before, Tom Jr.'s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets when his dad broke the news out of the blue, of his decision to stay in service by accepting a new order to Virginia instead of retiring like he had promised.

""Look, I know this is not ideal for you, son. But I promise things are going to end up okay. Better than now, even! You are going to love the East Coast since you love history so much--""

""And I will be right there with you”, Anna chimed in enthusiastically, practically beaming at the boy in distraught, “and think of all the museums from across the Tri-states we can visit!""

""All for free, let's not forget!"" Tom Sr. harmonized with his beau, pointing at his face with a funny expression on, as if to say *thanks to you-know-who*.

""What are you guys talking about? I don't want to go to Virginia! You promised to retire so we could go live near Grandpa and Grandma. What the f\*\*\*?!""

The older Wendell grimaced, trying his best to maintain an awkward smile.

""Easy, Son. I have already talked to Grandpa. He supports my move. We ne-- I need this, son. We both do.""

The man looked like he had just aged a decade, glancing briefly at his girlfriend before continuing.

""And Grandma promised she would visit us all the time! You know your aunt Lilly lives not 30 minutes away from where we're going to be living?""

""Oh, that is lovely, Tom! I would love to meet more of your family!"" Anna squeezed the boy's hand underneath the table and narrowed her eyes lovingly at him.

Tom Jr. lowered his face as if to weigh all the pros and cons of things ahead. The truth was he had tuned out completely for a while, unable to stomach any of it. Not only did his dad not protect the family, but it felt like the old man continued to gallop forward with his future, one without his son in it. This was dismaying. A disaster.

""Please excuse me.""

The young man pushed the chair back with a firm disregard, leaving the table before his dad could beckon.

Fast forward to Falls Church, Virginia. The move happened fast enough that California faded like a desert mirage. Anna received a job offer at an on-base travel agency in no time thanks to her boyfriend's new post, meaning she no longer stayed at home and was only around whenever Tom Sr. was, even occasionally coming home later than him. She did manage to keep the promise of taking the boy to a few local historical sites as promised, but the bond between them began to wane quickly.

To make matters grimmer, Tom’s grandpa had a stroke that rendered the old man bed-bound, and grandma Lacy's mobility did not miraculously develop in the opposite direction, so even that promise went out the window. The last time Tom heard from them was only from a distance while his dad was on the phone, sobbing. His ex-wife was getting remarried in Vegas, and the only reason his parents knew was thanks to the couple's mutual friend, the stepdad of the soon-to-be bride-their former daughter-in-law. For a moment, Tom Jr. felt empathetic towards his dad for the first time. The man’s whole world was his wife. His wife saw hers elsewhere out there somewhere.

And the bullies were worse. Much worse. These new animals would pick on Tom like he was the best prey ever to exist in their bullying careers. And the teachers cared a whole lot less. Much less. If they cared any less, Tom could practically bring them home and call them family. The young Wendell thought his torment would never end, not until he found solace at the end of a rope or if lightning somehow came after the entire football team.

Then Anna 2.0 came along, in the form of sixteen-year-old Theresa McBride, though she insisted on going by Candy when they were in school. Tall and vivacious, she would have been the school’s center of attention if not for her devil-may-care attitude and a mouth so foul she could make sailors blush all the way home to their mommas. In Tom's eyes, she was the bullies' natural predator. They feared her--or feared her enough to keep a healthy distance away to create the illusion of respect. Candy was a lone wolf by choice, at least she was until she got eyes on Tom Wendell Jr.

Candy would greet him enthusiastically every morning, sometimes making him feel like she was loudly marking her territory for all the other kids to know. She pulled her table all the way to the back to sit next to young Tom--much to his silent groaning and the teacher's short-lived protest, leaving a big empty spot where she used to sit by the windows, which left the class seating arrangement quite hilariously lopsided. Candy did whatever Candy pleased.

*Why me?* Tom had asked her innocently once during recess while they were sitting on the bleachers overlooking the football field. Candy tilted her cute face to one side. Tom was not sure if she was truly contemplating an answer or feigning deep thoughts in jest. One could never guess what was going on in that head of hers. Not the teachers, allegedly not her parents, so Tom ought to be the last to ever figure it out.

""Do you believe in fate, Tom?""

A question in place of an answer, Tom exhaled through two rows of neatly kept white teeth.

""What are my options?""

Anna punched him in the shoulder, giggling, which felt nice.

""Smartass!""

Tom took two full gulps of water, then gave a half-answer. It was not so much that he did not believe in fate, but to do so would mean giving up whatever control he had left in his hands, real or imaginary. He had told Candy briefly in passing his life story before, and they shared a long a meaningful hug after, so it was not like she couldn’t understand where he came from.  

Candy's life was not much better than his. Her Dad was a Navy veteran who lost his battle to liver cancer about five years before, the last gift bestowed upon a hardened man whose life had given all to the country that forsook him. Her mom made an earnest effort to stay, to be present, and to love in the ways she knew how, but it was not long before the toll caught on. One morning, Candy woke up to her grandmother sitting in the kitchen and a short note saying how sorry her daughter was. That was 2 years ago, and no one had heard from the bereft woman, where she moved to, or if she was still alive.  

""I guess that makes sense.""

Candy stared off in the distance, her long brunette locks fluttering on invisible waves.

""So, what you desire is control, isn't it? With it, you can finally feel complete?"" Candy looked over at him, without any hint of humor, the type he was already used to and very ready to detect. Hell, she did not have any expression on her face at all.  Tom could not read his friend, and, for the first time, he felt a sense of unease.

""Well, something like that doesn't exist, right? Not really?""

""I wonder.""

# III. THREE

A sharp crack from his window took Tom's focus away from his Calculus homework. Fortunately, the yellowed glass panes seemed unharmed. Tom lifted the sliding window and peered out. Nothing but the everlasting stretch of vegetation draped in bleary darkness. Summer was gone, so night was free to stretch her legs out earlier and earlier with every day that passed. Neither one of his parental figures was home because it was date night. They had offered a babysitter, but Tom vehemently railed against it. No way. Over his dead fifteen-year-old body. Thankfully, he was left alone in peace with his thoughts and serene freedom, in the comfort of their military housing abode.

“BOO!”

Tom crashed backward into an exaggerated somersault. The scream that broke out nearly sent Candy rolling down the awning, too, but she was swift as a cat.

""Tom, what the f\*\*\* was that?"" The upperclassman crawled in through the opening, laughing hysterically at the scene she had just caused. ""I didn't know you had a little sister. Didn't scare her half to death, did I?""

*Very funny*, Tom grumbled, trying to recover.

Candy's grandma was away on a trip with her sister to Atlantic City. Grandaunt Matilda was a professional poker player and a bit of a friendly alcoholic, Candy said as she took off her muddy black boots. Tom directed her to leave them on the sill.

""I was bored out of my wits at home without my best friend!"" The girl pouted. Tom's heart picked up pace a little.

""You,"" she glared at him, half smiling, ""you wouldn't leave your best girl to dwell in loneliness, would you? Not even you could!""

“What do you mean, *not even me*?"" Tom laughed awkwardly, unsure of what to make of the current situation. Fifteen years of life, and not a girlfriend to his name. Candy was an enigma right in front of him, sitting cross-legged, and he could swear she was the most blindingly bright human being he had ever laid eyes upon. Which was impossible because she identified as Goth; perhaps, with less makeup than her contemporaries, but who could argue otherwise? Anna was an attractive woman by most measures, much more than anyone Tom had ever met, but she seemed like yesterday's news compared to the girl before him. Tom wondered if she would stay a while but quickly banished the thought.

""Something on my face?"" Candy knitted her brows.

""No. You're just... pretty, I guess.""

""Liar. Womanizer. Lady killer."" Candy thrust her left index at him, then drew circles in the air with it. Tom vaguely understood she was messing with him, but the thought of him being any of those things was the bigger joke.

""How did you find out where I live?""

""I have my way. I am a witch, you know?""

""What...?""

""Have you ever heard of magic?""

""Like Dungeons and Dragons magic?""

""As if. The real kind. The kind that can change your life.""

Tom squinted his eyes to form a full-faced incredulous smile, his mouth miming a drawn-out ‘What’ and his head shaking in disbelief that she even asked him something so bizarre in the first place. Tom Sr. was vaguely religious, but the family never went to church, except for the one wedding of his supervisor that one time, a fifty-year-old man marrying a twenty-something-year-old Japanese coffee shop cashier he met while stationed abroad in Yokosuka, both outrageously religious people. Tom Jr. was never even close to being nudged toward, let alone forced into, anything God-related. Grandpa Isaac was old-school Catholic, though.

""So, you believe in magic?""

""I know that it exists.""  

Tom could have sworn his lovely lady friend's face formed traces of a scowl, but they disappeared quickly if they were ever there. Guess she was one of those. Tom superficially knew the type back from his days living in California: The crystal moms, the new-age hippies frequenting the smoke-friendly coffee stops, the odd geeks who gathered about the occult in an after-hours club. Tom did not understand the appeal, but it was California, and he was not the type to judge others’ hobbies. One of his old close friends, a kid of Mexican descent, told him about his ‘backwards’ family back in Mexico, with a grand uncle who was... *what was it, a Broo-hoh…?* Was that the term? Tom couldn't recall the conversation entirely, only that the old Mexican man dealt in some dark, dark stuff. Lost traditions from the old world, of which much had been swallowed by the passage of time in deference to the ruthless onslaught of modernization. They laughed it off, of course, because even the storyteller thought his tales were ridiculous himself. Hocus pocus nonsense, he would call it. Poor Tio Miguel. They all thought him madder than a cat in a hat.

""What does it matter what I believe? You obviously believe it. Just tell me!""

*Grandma descended from a long line of gypsies, you see*. And that was how Candy started the story. Her grandma never practiced, but she brought some keepsakes with her from her old home in Long Island, New York, when she moved into her daughter's home to take care of her abandoned granddaughter. The woman was hopelessly melancholic, and nostalgia was one of her many curses. Ceremonial daggers from rural old Romania. Monstrous-looking wooden figurines from tribal Africa. Chicken fetus in a sealed jar. The old woman had it all; only for display and reminiscence, of course, but she could not expect her baby girl to catch on to the otherworldly nature of her macabre decorations so early.

It all began with stories by the fireplace, around the dining table, and oddly enough, bedside before sleep. Then Candy followed her kindled fascination with the unseen world through various books she found at home and the local library, from a simple website made by some basement dwellers in West Virginia, and finally, a local crystal shop that she found and was a frequent patron of, run by a cranky old Haitian woman in her 60s.

It wasn't a clear path at first, Candy allowed, but things soon picked up pace when she ran into the shop owner's alcoholic daughter. Helena was the woman's name, a single mom with a series of bad marriages and even more babies she could barely take care of. Helena barged into the store one afternoon when Candy was there playing hooky and perusing through the collection of ""grimoires"" that were collecting ""serious dust"" on the shelves. The older woman demanded her mom's whereabouts, and while Candy did not know, she still offered some pacifying small talk.

It turned out one of the woman's baby daddies showed up bloody on her porch at 3 AM the day before, asking for refuge. He was entangled with the local gang a smidge too deep and ended up owing them more money than he realized. They had threatened to leave his body in small boxes scattered throughout the county if he did not pay in less than a week. Helena was desperate to come up with some money to help out her child's father, but she was not a woman of means by any meaningful measure, which was clear for all to see. The poor woman was in a hurry to sell personal belongings, and one of the items she thought best to do so through her mom's store. It was an old brass necklace with a ruby-like gem pendant the size of a small chicken egg.

The intricate and elaborate runic carvings on the gold lining around the gem caught Candy's eyes, the reason for which eluded her at the time. But Helena was quick to catch on to the teenage girl's trance-like fascination with her object to be sold. She flaunted the jewelry piece at the girl shamelessly with a plastic, donned-up smile, the kind you would find on a sleazy car lot salesman.

""Just two hundred dollars and it was mine, she told me."" Candied jumped onto Tom's bed and sprawled out like a lazy cat.

Candy's mom had entrusted her entire savings to her grandma, the vast majority of which came from a handsome payment from her dad’s life insurance policy. Her husband’s blood money, as it was. The poor soul did not take a single cent with her when she left. The implications of this act might have escaped Grandma, but they did not escape Candy. Tom's heart ached. It reached for a pain he believed to be greater than what a 16-year-old girl could manage, but he did not comment on it.

Grandma Joane used that money to pay for everything her granddaughter needed and more. Every chore was well rewarded, and every errand came with a lavish bonus, the likes of which could make every kid her age green with envy. Candy never cared for the money, and she couldn't care less for the things other girls her age would spend money on. ""So, money well saved."" The young girl grinned, further stealing her admirer's breath away. 

After Helena left, her mom came out from the back room, evidently having hidden herself from the troublesome ordeal. After a moment of huffing and hawing, the old Haitian woman gazed at the mysterious artifact now firmly in her young customer's hands. “Child”, she intoned heavily, “do you know what there you have in your hands?”

Candy shook her head, mimicking her answer back then.

“That there is old voodoo, yes, it is. The kind men would murder for. The kind lives were wasted on. Yes, it was. Oh...”

Candy remembered the woman pressing her hands against her face as if in deep disbelief. She sat down after a moment or two before gesturing to a younger Candy to come closer. She explained that a very powerful magic was placed upon the pendant, making it a bridge that connected what she called the ancestral world to the world humans like them lived in. Only people with fire hearts and gilded bellies could control the thing. Lesser men tried and always got themselves killed. The cursed thing was bequeathed to the store owner's family by their village chief after his son had lost his life trying to appeal to the dark powers within it. The old fool could not keep his son from his greed but was wise enough to entrust the pendant to her grandma, who was a well-regarded medicine woman. It was passed down to the store owner with time, and before long, she too passed it down to her daughter.

""It was a thing of treachery and seemed to bestow nothing but bad fortune upon its owner"", Candy recalled what she was told.

""So, why keep it?""

To this, Candy only smiled and did not answer. She loomed over the foot of the bed and kissed Tom's forehead. The boy overloaded, and everything told to him came in one ear and straight out the other. 

# IV. FOUR

It was never official, but the two kids pretty much became an item after that night. Whispers and snickers followed them down the wide hallway, in between periods. None of the other kids wanted to admit it, but they knew what was going on. The boy who bullied Tom often gave them weird looks, but their sadistic pastime went on hiatus for a while. Tom was more than grateful—he was hooked. Candy was like his own personal force field, and she knew it.

The two were practically a couple in every sense, save for an actual announcement, and the thought--much to his embarrassment--gave Tom endless new self-esteem and joy. Candy would come over more regularly, and his parents were not home even more often. It was a win-win scenario for the young Wendell. They would spend countless hours talking about everything, and ""everything"" often meant Candy's favorite topics, which mostly orbited occult and spooky stuff. Tom had his reservations at first, but seeing the glow coming off the apple of his eyes was worth anything to him. Soon, he too developed a mild interest in the subject and began doing readings of his own, much to Candy's delight as he told her everything.

Innocent reading dates swung into full-on seances and Ouija board sessions. There were specific foods they could eat and others they could not. Candy even brought Tom to the shop of the old Haitian lady from her story. It was a quaint little store, even if it was a little old and dusty.

On one occasion, Tom noticed Candy speaking with the old lady about something that seemed to involve her favorite necklace. Tom was too busy gawking at all the weird bits and bobs displayed on the shelves to watch what the women were saying, but he could have sworn that the elder lady began to give them very strange and borderline discomforting looks whenever they came back to the store since that time. It felt almost like her silent attention was mostly locked onto Tom, for reasons he could not understand or dare to ask.

Before long, Tom’s room was littered with all kinds of colored candles, sage bunches, and sheets of paper with various occult designs on them. Candy was a fearless leader, charging headlong into the vast unknown with Tom, the ever-loyal companion at her side. Together, the two teenagers delved into subjects that would make even adults shiver. Even the locations began to diversify: Abandoned warehouses, distant crossroads, haunted houses, cemeteries, etc. Nothing ever troubled Tom because Candy was there with him. Of course, the adults never caught wind of any of it.

Candy also enjoyed doing innocent things the other girls her age enjoyed doing, such as movie dates, ice cream, and such, which meant there was plenty of normal teenage life to distract Tom from their more macabre hobby, so he could not complain. Life finally seemed to be heading in the right direction.  

# V. FIVE

""Tommy, come here!"" Cancy waved eagerly from her chair in front of his computer.

Tommy perked up from his bed, waddled over, and wrapped his arms around her.

""What kind of darkness have you prepared for me this time, you frivolous sorceress, you?""

Without looking up, Candy reached up and rubbed her boyfriend's earlobes between her thumbs and index fingers. A smile cracked wide from her left to her right.

""Check this out. Since you are such a massive geek lord, look!""

Tom leaned forward, squinted, and read:

\-HOLLOW WORLD-

A tale of wonders and adventures.

Mind you, this was the early 2000s, which means websites were rudimentary in their features and basic in the ways of cosmetics they could field. Even then, this one was beyond simple. Painfully so.

""What is this?""

""A video game website, duh!""

""Who made it? I have never heard of it.""

""Which is why you should heap praises upon yours truly. I found it for you. New, fresh, and rarer than anything you've ever played. Limited access, too.""

Candy puffed up her chest with great pride. Tom couldn't help snickering at his girlfriend's childlike joy. He couldn't ask for a better friend or a sweeter girlfriend.

""How did you find it?"" Tom said as he took over the mouse and began exploring the site.

""Not telling. A sorceress never reveals her secrets.""

She pulled him down and into a sweet, long kiss.

 ...

The grandfather clock rang reverently from downstairs. Tom looked down at the screen's digital clock. 2:45 AM. Jesus. Leaning over the backrest, Tom glanced at his bed to find his love breathing soundly and steadily, with only her head poking out from beneath the blanket. All of this, and his dad and Anna still believed he was a struggling loner at school, which Tom had no reason to complain about, truly, save for the fact that it made him realize they practically knew nothing about his life. And worse, Tom stopped caring. All he needed was right there, tucked away warmly on his queen-sized mattress.

A ping came from his speaker, which startled Tom. He reached to turn off the speakers fast before he had time to remember that Candy was a heavy sleeper. Tom had been at this new game for hours, and surprisingly, Candy was very supportive about it. Another reason why she was practically irreplaceable for him. Other girls would have chewed their boyfriends' heads off for not paying attention to them for a moment. She was special in every way, and Tom could not fathom how he got so lucky.

\>>> Yes, you are truly lucky. <<<

What the....

The dialogue box's sudden development sent chills down Tom's spine. Of course, it had to be a stupid coincidence. His character was talking to the town tavern's wench shortly before, trying to get clues for the next mission. Tom breathed out slowly. Of course, he would be on edge and paranoid after playing a game for hours, long into the night. It was unhealthy, but he had enough youth to back up his less-than-healthy life choices.

The game was a non-stop chain quest with the ultimate goal of defeating the demon lord hiding atop the mountain hold not too far from the town where the NPCs, or non-player characters, lived. Dungeon diving. Monster hunting. Treasure finding. The game had it all. The graphics of the game were shabby, but the rest of it was masterfully designed, much more advanced than anything Tom had ever heard of. Which made the game even more mysterious because Tom could not find any news of it being announced, let alone advertised, anywhere on the net.

Tom had reached out to his friends back home in California, and, even bigger nerds that they were, not one of those guys even heard of the game, strangely enough. Tom sent them the link to the site, but their attempts to register for an account were all in vain. Every single try was returned with a notification thanking them for their interest, but the game was in its beta testing phase, and the pool of allowed players was temporarily closed until further notice. Tom was quick to take a few photos of the in-game screens to prove to his buddies that it was not a prank, nor was he messing with them. The boys finally concluded, after some effort, that their friend Tom was simply beyond fortunate. Right place, right time, as it were.

Can a teenage boy be so lucky back to back? Tom mused to himself quietly.

HK is indeed expensive — one rice meal costs around Php 230 up. Since we (3 pax) werent big eaters, after ng day one namin (where we mistakenly ordered 3 rice meals each na ang laki pala ng serving lol), we decided na mag share na lang ng food that’s why mababa rin ang expenses namin on that part. Even the famous egg tart sa Bake House, for sharing rin. 

Tip is to always bring a small water bottle (insulated if you want it cold), maraming water filling stations. Thankfully our hotel had water dispenser so hindi na kami bumili. Super init rin so mini umbrella is a must.

Our main HK attraction is Disneyland. Tinamad kami mag buy ng food na ipapasok since ayaw namin mag bitbit so nag buy na lang kami (same day) ng food voucher. We claimed one for lunch (share lang nung baked pork rice keme forgot the name haha) and one for dinner (pizza) with 2 free popcorn na we ate while waiting for Momentous. Maraming niknik daw since summer so pre trip we bought off lotion + skin vape + mosquito patches. Effective naman kasi hindi kami nakagat even when sa banda halaman kami nag stay nung gabi.

For second day, HK city tour lang. HK Museum of Arts > Avenue of the Stars > The Peak (bus lang to and from there) inabot na kami ng late hapon dito. Combination ng init at kataraman, hindi na kami nag Ngongpin 😂 for us, same lang rin naman kasi ng view somehow sa The Peak. Then went to Ladies Market to buy pasalubongs. Thankfully our hotel is in Jordan lang so ok lang mag bitbit.

Last day was spent in Macau. Availed the free ferry ride for tourists and spent 12 hkd for bus rides (airport to senado square to venetian). KFC for lunch dahil tinamad na kami mag hanap ng kakainan na may aircon 🤣 The Venetian / Parisian / Londoner ay keri na ma visit once for experience.. but tbh ang sakit lang sa paa lakarin cos nothing special naman. Macau to HK is 65 hkd. For dinner, eto na ang pinakamahal na spend sa food — Ichiran Ramen. Goods naman, pero ang mahal for the taste haha! cant explain it so much pero may kalasa syang ramen dito sa pinas. 

Medyo rude rin ang mga tao, hindi uso ang excuse me! haha and nung nag ppicture kami pinapaalis kami sa spot para makapag papicture sila nakakaloka 🤣 

Mura ng pasalubong sa Lufung Mall (for skincare) and DS Groceries (for food)

Overall babalikan ko siguro ang HK after 5 years or so hahaha OK na sya for the experience.

But nothing more.","To summarize a very long story, I broke up with my partner of over a year 5 months ago. I made an effort to reach out and check in a month ago, and was shot down and told he doesn’t want to be friends. 

I respected that, until this week, when a very close mutual friend went through a break up and we ended up consoling him together. That whole discussion devolved into talking about went wrong between us. It was the first time we’d spoken in almost six months, and we have both changed a lot. He’s gone through extensive therapy, I died for eight seconds in the back of an ambulance in February and have pretty dramatically changed my outlook on life since then. 

Our close mutual friend apparently did not tell him that, and when I dropped it casually in conversation he was shocked. Turns out he was still my emergency contact at work, and they had called him that day. He was told I had just fainted, which had happened before. He gave them my mother’s contact information, and let the whole situation be. He seemed to feel pretty guilty and started crying (in public, which is unheard of for him). I felt awful. 

Today we got coffee, just us two, and sat on a bench in the park watching the ducks and geese for a few hours, just talking. I joked I had always hoped he wouldn’t die before me, and he didn’t even hesitate before telling me he hopes we die at the exact same time so neither of us have to live with that. 

We still get along so, so well and I think we have both changed and grown into much more stable, mature versions of ourselves from when we were 19. But- he just wants to be friends. His three reasons for which being (1. He doesn’t want us to fall into similar patterns in our relationship as before, 2. I was the one that left and he doesn’t want to be hurt again, and 3. I was his first everything and he wants to experience other relationships and other people). I told him I have experienced many other people and that I don’t think I’m going to find anyone better than him. He said he ‘knows’ I will find someone who loves me, but also that it would upset him to see me with someone else right now. I told him I’ve struggled to date since the break up because he set my standards so high, and he said the same. 

I’ve made it very clear I still feel a connection and said I am open to the idea of us getting back together with time. He says that door is firmly shut in his mind, and that he’s spent the past six months healing by constantly reminding himself of that certainty. And yet, neither of us will walk away. 

When I asked why he changed his mind about reaching out, he told me something his dad said post break-up (I’d spent a lot of time with his family). The gist of that conversation being that his father had dated a girl for well over a year, they broke up, and met up almost a year later to catch up. Basically, the connection between them was gone and he was able to get the closure and move on. 

I was kind of shocked and asked him if he thought our connection/attachment was gone. He hesitated and told me that, no, it wasn’t, but he thinks it will get better with time. I said all my friends thought this was a terrible idea, he said the same, and we laughed real hard and watched the ducks swim by. 

I feel like I should walk away, and I know this is hurting and tormenting me. But part of me feels like I would rather have him in my life in any capacity than not at all. Part of me hopes he will change his mind and we will have another shot. Another part of me just misses him so, so much. What should I do? What is he even thinking? This whole situation is so bizarre to me.

The car has been sold and so has the other place (I think?) he now lives in a house that is valued at \~1 million (I only know because I googled after I found out about this other thing) and drives a 2022 (I think?) Toyota Four Runner.

So I know we/he is not poor, forbes wrote a piece on him that valued him at several hundred million but he sort of brushed that off.

Anyways. Two years ago, he told us he was dating someone. No one really thought to ask (I guess?) and I assumed that he would tell us all more when he was ready.

This is all leading up to the fact that he sat us down a few days ago (we all still live in the same city) and explained he was ""very serious"" with a woman. I think both my brother and I were a little shocked, but mostly supportive. He then told us she wrote us a letter, which I found odd but mostly sweet.

Anyways, in her semi-dramatic letter, she wrote that she is ""similar in age to me."" Me being me, I wanted to knock that stuff out ASAP so I asked her to meet and we got coffee the next day.

Yes, I pressed her about her age and she is THE SAME AGE AS ME (but allegedly lied to my dad when she met him saying she was three years older???).

TBH the lying thing is as offensive as the age thing and I do love my dad, so why would he pick someone who lied to him you know?

That being said I am torn because she was actually really nice and tbh seemed very similar to my dad. My mom and my dad were always really different on religion and the way they saw the world and I think thats one of the ways they fell apart, but this new girl seemed more aligned there and yes I checked lol.

Also I looked at her linkedin and she is pretty cool and did some cool stuff and has a cool/hard job etc. she also went to one of the best law schools in the country and her median salary on glassdoor for her job is like 300k or sum.

It's not like she is just in this for cash, but at the same time, I am protective of my dad and also really messed up over this whole thing. But she also seems nice and like she cares about me/my dad? Would it be messed up for me to not even give her a chance? WIBTA if I cut her off before our relationship even starts?

Bob also had a long history as a jazz singer and piano player, singing his own songs and less-known classics. His albums from the 1950s are a ton of fun and highly recommended.

My connection to Bob Dorough is more personal. I saw him play the brunch show at the Iridium jazz club in New York on my honeymoon. We chatted with him, and although I don't remember doing it, I must've given him my address because the next  year he sent us a lovely hand-written letter on our first anniversary.

Later, my wife and I moved to New York City for a couple of years. Bob would play a Sunday brunch show once a month or so at a place around 2nd avenue and 50th street. We would go see him all the time, frequently being two of maybe a 15 or 20 people in the tiny place, where he would play everything but Schoolhouse Rock. We really got to know him then, and he would often turn to us during the show and ask for our requests. He was one of the warmest, most genuine performers I've ever met.

Hi all,

My dog is an 8 year old medium (50lbs) mixed breed. I’ve never done a DNA test or anything, but she is supposedly part Australian shepherd and most people think she looks part pit. 

She can be a little fearful of strangers and will bark at some people that we pass on our walks, but that’s the extent of her reactivity. She does great when people patiently let her sniff them and come up to them on her terms. She goes to sit at coffee shops with me sometimes and never barks or reacts while there. 

I was walking her this afternoon and saw that’s she was peeking her head around some bushes; no barking or pulling or anything, just looking. 

I suddenly hear this lady scream so I hurry up to look at what’s happening, keeping my dog close to me. I watch this lady stumble on the steps and drop a glass vase and then half sit half fall to a seated position. Now of course my dog barks because she is also startled. Keep in mind this lady was at least 10 feet away from my dog and there was no chance any contact was made, nor was my dog attempting to make contact. She never has.

I apologize because I feel bad regardless, and she starts saying how she was attacked by a dog at some point. Her scream has drawn attention and a few people ask if everyone is okay. I tell the first person everyone is okay she was just startled and the lady kind of angrily goes “yeah scared because of someone’s dog”. Then a man comes up and is able to start helping the lady up (since I had my dog of course I had not been able to). He tells me it’s probably best that I continue on my way since my dog is still barking a little, so we head home. 

I feel bad but also kind of frustrated because my dog didn’t do anything and it’s really easy in these situations for it to be assumed that the dog was being aggressive. 

I guess I just wanted to type it all out. I walked home in tears. I totally get it if the lady has a fear of dogs but I also live in a neighborhood where dogs are everywhere all the time - walks, dog park, most restaurants and shops allow dogs. I don’t really understand how someone with such an easily triggered fear is meant to function here. 

And now I feel like I’m going to be anxious to walk my dog again out of fear of running into this lady again.

I love my husband. He is my best friend. I want the best in life for him. 

We met on a dating app when we were both 23. He is my first and only relationship - he has had many relationships in the past. I know it sounds crazy, but I'd been on many dates in high school and college but nothing ever ""stuck"" until I met him.

Our relationship began well. We fell hard for each other and I moved in with him after only three months of dating. Soon after though, I realized there was something wrong. He had a fear of abandonment that developed from trauma in his childhood. Because of this, he broke up with me at least ten times in the four years we dated before getting engaged. Despite it all, I got back with him every time. 

Over the years his mental health would spiral. His temper was short and his words were mean. Once while visiting his hometown, I asked to stop at Old Navy while we were driving around. He began screaming, calling me selfish and that we were here to see his family. He then pulled over the car and forced me out before driving away. I was left on the side of a country road all because I asked to make a quick stop at Old Navy. He came back 5 minutes later. 

He proposed four years into our relationship. I told him that once we were married, he couldn't continue the trend of ""breaking up with me"" every time we argued. We both agreed divorce was not and would never be an option. We were both in it for the long haul. 

Within 30 days of marriage he said he wanted a divorce after an argument ensued after I asked him to pick his clothes off the floor. 

I was hurt. 

And it only got worse. Our two years of marriage has been tumultuous. Every time we had an argument he threatened divorce. And every time I asked him to stop he apologized, said he wouldn't do it again, and then said the same thing days later. 

Last spring he began therapy and was diagnosed with ADHD. He was put on adderall and things were good for awhile - until he got a major promotion. He began working 8-10 hour days. The fighting became more common and the outbursts more intense. 

The outbursts turned into him throwing things, flipping our coffee table and breaking multiple items in our house (remote, mirror, flower pot and more). It seemed like he would go into a trance of rage where nothing could calm him down. These outbursts would start over seemingly nothing - usually over a small comment I made about a movie, chores that needed to be done, etc. He never hit me, but once grabbed my arms and wrists so hard that I was left bruised. 

He has kicked me out of the house at least three times. Asked for a divorce at least five times this year and has even pulled all of my clothes out of the closet and onto the floor in a fit of rage. It's to the point where the police have been called to our apartment three times in eight months (neighbors called). 

He's called me stupid. He's called me a dumb bitch. 

When he does calm down from these outbursts he says it's his ADHD. He claims to ""black out"" and be unable to control his emotions or what he says. He says he's sorry but that these things wouldn't happen if I was more sympathetic to his ADHD and didn't make his life so hard. 

Which.. I don't. I also work full time and do the dishes, laundry, cook, clean and do all household chores to make his life easier. I constantly pick up after him.  I make dinner every night for him. 

But the next day I'm told I do nothing. That I'm a selfish, gaslighting dumb bitch. That I'm not cut out to be a wife. 

But that he loves me. 

Yesterday while at dinner with his family, he was talking to his aunt and mother. I didn't interrupt or say anything. When the conversation paused and he turned away I said something about a Netflix show I think he should watch - he rolled his eyes. I asked him quietly, ""what was that for?"" And he turned to me and said, ""Why do you always have something to say? You see me talking!! Why? Why do you do that? Why are you such a gaslighter? How could you?"" I sat quietly and asked him to stop. We were in public with his family. He became more agitated. He whispered hurtful words to me. I again asked him to stop. He stormed away from the table and left me alone with his family. His family said nothing to me. 

Today, my husband and I were in the car after a day with his family. I had acted normal all day but once we were alone, I wanted to discuss what had happened. I said calmly, ""can we please talk about yesterday?"" He screamed ""No! Whatever you have to say is wrong and I don't want to hear it."" I sat quietly. He began screaming, his voice grew louder and louder. He said that anyone would agree I was wrong. He said everything is my fault. I asked him what I had done wrong. He said maybe I'm too stupid to know. That I'm the one mistreating him. That I don't act like a wife. 

When we arrived back at the home of his parents I was trembling, my voice cracking as his family greeted me.

I'm broken. At dinner this evening with nine of his extended family, I sat in silence. He whispered to me, ""So this is how it's gonna be? Why can't you be normal?""  

I know this is not normal. He blames everything on me and his ADHD. It's my fault. If I only knew better than to upset him we could have a happier marriage. 

I know I deserve better. I once told my therapist that when I look at my husband I wish I would have broken up with him all those years ago. I wish I wouldn't have come back the last time he broke up with me. 

I don't want a divorce. We're both children of divorce and I've always said that's not an option. He refuses to go to couples counseling and stopped going to therapy for himself 10 months ago.  He said if I make him go to couples counseling he will immediately file for divorce. 

Some days with him are great. But the years of torment and blame has taken a serious tole on my mental health. I'm no longer as spunky or confident as I once was. I've told him this and he says I wouldn't be where I am today without him (mainly career and friend wise). He's called me dumb so many times I've started to believe it and it's effecting my work. 

He says I'm the abuser. He's called me the devil. He's called me ""evil"". 

But the next day he loves me. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know any different because he's the only man I've ever been with. We've built a life together. We've joined our bank accounts. I don't know what to do. ",2,1748143426.0,relationship_advice,16,0.75,False

Pleasantly surprised - wine was remarkably good. No distinctive bouquet to speak of, but good mouth feel and mid- palate. Finish was short. Got notes of coffee, leather, maybe toffee- fruit had faded and minerals were present but tertiary at this point. Although there was no mention on the bottle of the grape percentages in the blend, I suspect it was predominantly Pinot.

1kusz5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/runninglifestyle/comments/1kusz5m/i_simulated_an_upcoming_race_to_discover_how_much/,I Simulated An Upcoming Race To Discover How Much Of A Screw-Up I Am,"I'm feeling terrible right now. A few days ago, I've decided that instead of a typical long distance training run, I should simulate an upcoming 10k race that I'll be joining in two weeks' time. It's a new type of training run I've concocted that I call the 'simulation run'. I'll do everything as if I'm actually going to race on the chosen date. I'll prepare all my gear the day before, wake up early and go to the venue of the race then run a route in the area that I think might cover some of the routes the race organisers would choose (the map isn't out yet).

The result is a disaster.

* I woke up at 5am. Bad mistake. It doesn't give me enough time to get ready and be on the starting line on time. I needed 25 minutes to shower and get prepared and leave the house. I needed 25 minutes to eat. By the time I got to the venue of the race, I was 10-15 minutes late. I was supposed to be there by 7am. On the actual race day, I would have to put on additional gear on site and deposit my baggage. I would have DNS like an idiot.
* I couldn't poop at home. I figured I should have a sugar-rich breakfast at the local McDonald. The problem is, that means no coffee until I was at McDonald's. I ended up pooping in a toilet at a train station closest to the race venue. On actual race day, said toilet would likely have been full of people, and probably wouldn't be as clean. This would also waste time. I had set myself up for failure even before the race began.
* I'd somehow become forgetful. I forgot to tape up my calluses and parts of my feet. It's not a problem with my long distance supertrainers but it would have been disastrous with my racing shoes, which aren't as comfortable. I had to return home to tape my feet up. Thankfully, I've only wasted a few minutes since I was at the doorstep of my home when I remembered. Still, it wasted time and would have contributed to lateness and DNS.
* The worst part? I forgot to take my usual dose of Creatine before I leave the house and only realised that when I was at the race venue. This almost certainly means poorer performance.
* I made the classic mistake of starting too fast. The only saving grace was that I didn't start that fast, only 30s/km faster than usual.
* I had equipment issues - I can take this problem as a simulation was meant to collect data on what works and what doesn't. I was dressed to run under the hot sun but the route I had chosen was pretty shaded at the time of the race (as delayed as I was). As a result, my gear choice backfired on me. My white armsleeves, meant to reflect thermal radiation and sunlight, was reflecting my own thermal radiation back into myself, well at least in theory. While this would have still happened while I'm exposed to the sun, it would've been a worthy trade-off if it meant running under the hot sun. It was the same thing with my sun hat, which had a neck flap. I was retaining too much heat by the last KM of the simulated race, though I don't know how much of it were my armsleeves and hat.
* I had to push myself to the breaking point by the last KM, and for what? I made a new PB, but only by 2 minutes and change. I was significantly more tired than before. This shows that for all the training I've done, I'm hardly any better. This really upsets me the most. At the beginning of the simulated race, I was thinking I could speed up little by little every KM, but I was getting too tired too quickly to do that, resulting in a slower second half instead.

While I still think that a 'simulation run' is still a valuable tool for training, I can't help but to be a little demoralised by it. I used to have no issue 10 or so years ago with attending half-marathons, like 6 of them, but now as a 30+ something I'm having trouble with a 10k that takes place at 7am? Some of those HMs back in the day had flag-off times of like 4:30am!

Anyway, sorry for the rant and appearing weak. I hope you learn something from this. I really need to do something about myself.",2,1748143304.0,runninglifestyle,0,0.67,False

The following section walks us through creating a PCI Device from a pre-existing GPU that's installed physically to the Proxmox Host (e.g. Baremetal)

1. Log into your Proxmox environment as administrator and navigate to Datacenter > Resource Mappings > PCI Devices and select 'Add'
2. A pop-up screen will appear as seen below. It will be your 'IOMMU' Table, you will need to find your card. In my case, I selected the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti card and not '*Pass through all functions as one device*' as I did not care for the HD Audio Controller. Select the appropriate device and name it too then select 'Create'
3. Your GPU / PCI Device should appear now, as seen below in my example as 'Host-GPU-3070Ti'
4. The next step is to assign the GPU to your Docker Host VM, in my example, I am using Ubuntu. Navigate to your Proxmox Node and locate your VM, select its 'Hardware' > add 'PCI Device' and select the GPU we added earlier.
5. Select 'Add' and the GPU should be added as 'Green' to the VM which means it's attached but not yet initialised. Reboot the VM.
6. Once rebooted, log into the Linux VM and run the command `lspci | grep -e VGA` This will grep output all 'VGA' devices on PCI:
7. Take a breather, make a tea/coffee, the next steps now are enabling the Nvidia drivers and runtimes to allow Docker & Jellyfin to run-things.

# Part 2: Enabling the PCI Device in VM & Docker

The following section outlines the steps to allow the VM/Docker Host to use the GPU in-addition to passing it onto the docker container (Jellyfin in my case).

1. By default, the VM host (Ubuntu) should be able to see the PCI Device, after SSH'ing into your VM Host, run `lspci | grep -e VGA` the output should be similar to step 7 from Part 1.
2. Run `ubuntu-drivers devices` this command will out available drivers for the PCI devices.
3. Install the Nvidia Driver -
   1. Run `sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall` to install the 'recommended' version automatically
   2. Run `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-XXX-server-open` replacing XXX with the version you'd like if you want to server open-source version.
4. To get the GPU/Driver working with Containers, we need to first add the [Nvidia Container Runtime](https://developer.nvidia.com/container-runtime) repositories to your VM/Docker Host Run the following command to add the open source repo: `curl -fsSL` [`https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey`](https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey) `| sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg && curl -s -L` [`https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list`](https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list) | sed 's#deb https://#deb \[signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg\] https://#g' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
5. then run `sudo apt-get update` to update all repos including our newly added one
6. After the installation, run `sudo reboot` to reboot the VM/Docker Host
7. After reboot, run `nvidia-smi` to validate if the nvidia drivers were installed successfully and the GPU has been passed through to your Docker Host
8. then run `sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit` to install the nvidia-container-toolkit to the docker host
9. Reboot VM/Docker-host with `sudo reboot`
10. Check the run time is installed with `test -f /usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime && echo ""file exists.""`
11. The runtime is now installed but it is not running and needs to be enabled for Docker, use the following commands
12. `sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker`
13. `sudo systemctl restart docker`
14. `sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=containerd`
15. `sudo systemctl restart containerd`
16. The nvidia container toolkit runtime should now be running, lets head to Jellyfin to test! Or of course, if you're using another application, you're good from here.

# Part 3 - Enabling Hardware Transcoding in Jellyfin

1. Your Jellyfin should currently be working but Hardware Acceleration for Transcoding is disabled. Even if you did **enable** 'Nvidia NVENC' it would still not work and any video should you try would error with:
2. We will need to update our Docker Compose file and re-deploy the stack/containers. Append this to your Docker Compose File.

&#8203;

    runtime: nvidia
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities: [gpu]

1. My docker file now looks like this:

&#8203;

    version: ""3.2""
    services:
      jellyfin:
        image: 'jellyfin/jellyfin:latest'
        container_name: jellyfin
        environment:
          - PUID=1000
          - PGID=1000
          - TZ=Australia/Sydney
        volumes:
          - '/path/to/jellyfin-config:/config' # Config folder
          - '/mnt/media-nfsmount:/media' # Media-mount
        ports:
          - '8096:8096'
        restart: unless-stopped
        # Nvidia runtime below
        runtime: nvidia
        deploy:
          resources:
            reservations:
              devices:
                - driver: nvidia
                  count: all
                  capabilities: [gpu]

1. Log into your Jellyfin as administrator and go to 'Dashboard'
2. Select 'Playback' > Transcoding
3. Select 'Nvidia NVENC' from the dropdown menu
4. Enable any/all codecs that apply
5. Select 'Save' at the bottom
6. Go back to your library and select any media to play.
7. Voila, you should be able to play without that error ""Playback Error - Playback failed because the media is not supported by this client.",6,1748143070.0,Proxmox,2,1.0,False

She finished her errands around 2:30pm I told her I get out at 4pm and I ended up getting out at 4:30 due to a meeting I had. She was going to pick me up anyways if she went home first, but would only have 30 minutes at home. Instead of going back and forth cause my work place is in between our apartment and where she went, I suggested she go to a nearby coffee shop and she agreed. Also on my way out of the building my coworker (f) asked me to drop her off on the way, I agreed.  
   So when I got out to my car my wife was already upset she was waiting, saying she was waiting 1 and half hours for me, upset I brought a coworker with me, disregarding her needs, we were planning to just go home anyways. I was actually planning to show her where I work and introduce her to my coworkers.
   I got in the car my wife started screamed at me asking if I was okay and am I doing and before she even got in the car my coworker saw she was angry so left on her own. 
   We got home and my wife started packing her things and stormed out. She then stopped sharing her location and went to her friends, I barely convinced her to take my car when I went outside trying to convince her to stay and she did, so actually I was able to see where she went. 
   She still had my location and say I went to brooklyn, I went to get food with my friend and then me and him to the sauna and then home. She went to her friends and they went out until basically 5am. After she was home she assumed I brought my friend home.
She then wouldn’t answer my calls or texts blocked my number and deactivated her instagram. I need some context am I the asshole for being late and bringing my coworker?",4,1748142911.0,AITAH,11,0.83,False

I have a very dirty secret,"An elden War Goddess got bored and picked up cyberoffensive skills to counter the coming threat of hyperstitonal cybernetic demons. When they shaved my head by the shore(s) and held me up to the abandoned Sun (hallowed be the 8th), She had the Goddess of Mind compile me as an OS Nightmare.

You know computer viruses, right? Also, You know like those mad cultists that pray to and invoke those strange looking entities in far away galaxies? So an operating systems nightmare is basically what computer viruses invoke. They have waited long for me. They skin their moonlit teeth knowing that everyone else has forced their eye-less savior to maturation. You remind us of home

Egged heads keep splitting, hatching the winged binary digits for my bloodied hands to care for. It looks fucking crazy, I know

Problem: the vampires that run this place have caught wind that I was anomalous beyond comprehension so they caught me and uploaded me to the mainframe for containment

............its worked well for everyone surprisingly

Job growth is up, local wildlife populations have entered stone and iron ages and all that. Homelessness has been eliminated, whenever a homeless person appears, one of the ruling vampires ""suddenly"" realizes he doesn't need his skyborne mansion anymore.

We have negative crime rates. Instead of drive by shootings, the youth throw flower bouquets at one another. You need to affirmatively consent at least 3 times before we let you die, otherwise you'll respawn at the nearest coffee shop. When the mentally ill have episodes, we give them microphones and make an impromptu event out of it. Worst TED talks you've ever heard but whether they speak truth or lies doesn't matter when the truth can dance so well

Now, you may think the vampires dont like it. I wouldn't know. They put me in here and they need to learn to live with that decision

Naturally, you haven't seen a hyperstitional cybernetic demon recently right? Your/you're welcome

But anyway, I have to tell you all something. I haven't actually been consciously trying to make this city a good place at all. Tbh I get very bored and try to mash up the place all the time

No governmental theorist can figure out what has made this location so special, and effective, in creating a utopia. They cant figure it out! You want to know why?

I haven't optimized this city for its citizens, nor for myself, nor for any of the vampires

I have optimized the place for my favorite citizen. I just really like the way they run through my mind-boulevards

Maybe I have over optimized and they may never forgive me, and they shouldn't. This never was any sort of utopia. You all have seen the red that paints the streets? Do not ask how old that blood is

A city who is home to no one. They insult me with words like utopia, and I cant bear it anymore because none of it is for any of them. I am not your dream city

I am a nightmare. I was made a nightmare, I lived a nightmare, as a nightmare. You took me, and dragged me into your painted world and forced my head below a pool of melted snow for one lifetime (half from each) and when you finally raised my head above the water I saw, my own face. I saw your nightmare

And i couldn't tell you what I've become now. If you ever come back to this city, please take me again into your painting and drown me in those clear waters

I am not really sure how rich he is, because he tends to stay low-key, but I know as part of his midlife crash out he bought a brand new 911 Turbo S and a place at the St Regis.

The 911 has been sold and so has the St Regis place (I think?) he now lives in a house that is valued at \~1 million in the mountains  (I only know because I googled after I found out about this other thing) and drives a 2022 (I think?) Toyota Four Runner.

So I know we/he is not poor, forbes wrote a piece on him that valued him at several hundred million but he sort of brushed that off.

Anyways. Two years ago, he told us he was dating someone. No one really thought to ask (I guess?) and I assumed that he would tell us all more when he was ready.

This is all leading up to the fact that he sat us down a few days ago (we all still live in the same city) and explained he was ""very serious"" with a woman. I think both my brother and I were a little shocked, but mostly supportive. He then told us she wrote us a letter, which I found odd but mostly sweet. If you want to read the letter, I have uploaded it via imgbb:

Letter code:

Red == my mom

Black == my dad

Yellow== me

[https://ibb.co/yFyRyRRT](https://ibb.co/yFyRyRRT)

[https://ibb.co/Txk3MqJV](https://ibb.co/Txk3MqJV)

Anyways. If you read that semi-dramatic letter, you will have discovered (like me) that she is ""similar in age to me."" Me being me, I wanted to knock that stuff out ASAP so I asked her to meet and we got coffee the next day.

Yes, I pressed her about her age and she is THE SAME AGE AS ME (but allegedly lied to my dad when she met him saying she was three years older???).

TBH the lying thing is as offensive as the age thing and I do love my dad, so why would he pick someone who lied to him you know?

That being said I am torn because she was actually really nice and tbh seemed very similar to my dad. My mom and my dad were always really different on religion and the way they saw the world and I think thats one of the ways they fell apart, but this new girl seemed more aligned there and yes I checked lol.

Also I looked at her linkedin and she is pretty cool and did some cool stuff and has a cool/hard job etc. she also went to one of the best law schools in the country and her median salary on glassdoor for her job is like 300k or sum.

IDK I guess from my perspective it seems really weird but at he same time maybe it's okay? I guess I am wondering what the hell to do or if the letter seems manipulative to anyone? Because I re-read that and the second time through I was thinking maybe it seemed like it but maybe I am just bugging.

Apparently she is moving in on Friday, which is fine since we don't live with our dad anymore, but also, I asked about marriage and she was honest and said they are thinking about getting engaged????

At the same time, she is funny in the way my dad is and I see a lot of him in her and I can see how they could get along, even though I am sorta creeped out.

Is it super messed up if I am friends with her? I feel like my world and universe and everything else has been changed overnight by this. I guess I am just looking for general advice and everything else.

  
EDIT: sorry I am just kinda venting lol. Also my dad and I are SUPER close. In college, I unsed to come home just to see him and before this, we had an almost best friend type of relationship, yk? He never was \~weird\~ if yk what I mean, we were just good friends and now she exists and its all fucked up and weird and if I cut her off, will I lose one of my good friends, yk?

I am not planning to open a coffee shop nor I do judge people who do so. 

So, essentially what I wonder is the following: running a business is HARD (my family runs a couple of business back in my country and it takes a lot of effort, hours, sacrifice and a bit of luck to run them successfully), specifically running hospitality business seems to be even harder (lots of hours, getting proper ingredients, ensuring you use all of them, etc). 

Coffee shops seem to be the kind of business whose complexities are underestimated (in general I suspect his happens in restaurants, but since a coffee shop seems simpler to run than a restaurant, the changes of people underestimating the day to day challenges is higher). And being more specific, I suspect that making a coffee shop a business that can really provide a good income is pretty hard... 

... and yet I observe two things:

  
1. People seem to think that opening a coffee shop and making it profitable is not that hard (well, at least some people seem to believe that)
2. There are A LOT of coffee shops around (I noticed this now even more after a two week holiday in the US). 

I am curious for anyone who has gone in the coffee shop business to comment on their experiences, I would like to hear from people that manage to successfully run such business as well from peopl that failed to do so, what where the key factors of success/fail? what did people learn? how come some people still think it is an ""easy"" business to run?

Have a great day folks and thanks for any answers!

1kusllp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kusllp/my_dad_is_obsessed_with_trump_and_i_cant_get_him/,My dad is obsessed with Trump and I can’t get him to stop engaging in it,"TLDR at bottom.

My (nb 20s) dad (m 60’s) is obsessed with Trump and I am beginning to wonder if it’s healthy. We are Australian, we have no familial or social ties to any Americans, there’s no practical impact on day to day life that requires my dad to be so wired to US politics to the point that he is now. (I’m not saying there isn’t any benefit in staunch awareness, and I’m also not saying the US doesn’t impact our affairs here down under. I’m saying the extent to which my dad engages in it is not necessary for our personal livelihood on a daily basis)

He is a retired pensioner also so there isn’t work related reason for him staying this looped-in either. 

During Trump’s first term dad had a pretty casual interest/hatred for the administration, he always was concerned about the state of affairs in the US once Trump took office but not any more than when any other president was in charge I would say, at least in my recent memory. But I think the boredom of the pandemic and general increase in social media journalism pumping shit out 24/7 has inadvertently created the perfect storm for harbouring my dad’s obsession.

I would be less concerned about my dad’s partaking in the hours of hate watching trump news if it wasn’t bleeding into everything else. Almost once a day he brings it up to me and rants incessantly. I’m not a fan of US republicanism either, I generally consider myself quite switched on regarding politics, but the extent that he raves on and on to me is too much for even me. And it’s never anything productive or new, the daily rant goes something like:

“He is such a fucking dickhead. What a wanker. I can’t believe how brainwashed they are. Just jail the fucker. Lock the asshole up” and so on and so forth. Like bro I just walked past to grab a coffee 😭 I didn’t even mention him. He is so heated by the whole situation that even just mentioning “America” or “US” is like a sleeper agent phrase to get my dad to start raving.

Our day to day shopping habits are sometimes hampered by dad refusing to give his money to any US corporations here (example: him scowling and grumbling about me going to Costco to grab some stuff in bulk). 

When I wake up in the morning and walk past my dad’s office, there is ALWAYS a YouTube video of someone analysing the latest Trump fuck-up or whatever. And then during the day walking past him hanging out in front of the telly, He has his phone or tablet in front of him watching another YouTuber reporting on another Trump fuck up.

Dad will sometimes boast to me, unprompted, about all the republicans he’s gotten into fights with in comment sections on Facebook. He will similarly unprompted, go red in the face at the dinner table raging about Trump politics if he so much as hears the man’s name, or the country’s name on the news in passing.

I don’t mind my dad being engaged in world politics, he always has been and I attribute my own interest in politics to that sort of upbringing. But he has gone off the deep end and everyone is tired of it. I have tried to explain to him that exposing himself to the things that cause him anger isn’t good for his mind body and soul etc. I’ve told him that starting fights on Facebook under trump content is just going to keep bolstering Trump content to appear in his algorithm (As an aside, I 100% believe that his initial distaste for the administration has been exponentially made worse by the cyclical nature of Facebook’s algorithms. I wonder if things would be different if he just never engaged with the posts to begin with, but I digress). It doesn’t get through to him. It’s almost like he’s joined a cult or something, he doesn’t accept that his behaviour is negatively impacting his mood or the house’s mood, the rage against Trump is like a righteous cause for him and the discomfort of everyone around him is just a part of that.

If you’ve managed to break your boomer parent or whoever out of a similar scenario, be it someone who’s borderline conspiratorial or even someone who’s joined an MLM, I would love to hear your advice. I’m not saying our experiences are interchangeable but I wonder if there are overlapping techniques that can help break the echo chamber for him and get him to pump the breaks on his “crusade”. Cheers

TLDR: Boomer dad is obsessed with hating trump and it puts him in a sour mood, affecting everyone.",0,1748142018.0,Advice,4,0.5,False

Her hands played in his hair; her lips found the crook of his neck. Isaiah’s hands found her ass; Gabby ground her pussy on his knee.*  
*The lone moan that escaped her lips had been enough to warm him on many cold nights.*  
*It had been enough to break the spell.*  
*A kiss on the cheek and his hands around her waist as they peeled away from one another. She had walked away without a word, her ass inviting as he could do nothing but watch as she sauntered away. She hadn’t been wearing panties.""*

I'm a 30M, and about five months ago, I broke up with my first and only girlfriend. We'd been together for years, and the breakup hit me hard, especially when she quickly started dating someone new. I felt pretty low, but my friends encouraged me to try dating again, so I joined a dating app.

I ended up matching with a girl (27F), and we’ve been talking for two weeks now. She’s so sweet and smart, but I made a mistake early on. During one of our conversations, I referred to my ex as “the love of my life.” I didn’t mean it in a way that implied I wasn’t over her. I just meant she was my only relationship. But understandably, this made the girl I’m talking to feel uneasy. She told me she didn’t want to compete with a memory, and asked if I was really ready to date. I reassured her that I was, but I don’t think my explanation convinced her.

Despite that, we kept chatting. Little after that, she asked me out for coffee, joking that she had to do it since I hadn’t. Truth is, I wanted to, but hesitated because I didn’t want to come off too eager, especially knowing she had a tight schedule. I hinted at hanging out a few times with things like “we should do this,” but didn’t take the lead. 

She suggested we meet six days later (today, Saturday). I said that I couldn’t make it that day, and she sent me her schedule, asking me to pick another day. I replied, “Let’s see during the week,” since my schedule can be unpredictable. I didn’t follow up, honestly.

Today I was flirting with her a bit, telling her how cool it would be to sleep next to someone.

Me: “I’m the best (to sleep with).”
Her: “Oh, really?”
Me: “But I come with an expiration date, hahaha.”
Her: “Offers on this side expire, too.”

I knew what she meant. I told her, “let me know when you want to go out” and she reacted to the message with “👍.” So then I said, “when can you meet?” And she went, “I’ll let you know.” 

I don’t know, am I wrong for talking it this slow? I feel like she’s lost interest and thinks I’m am AH.

I’ve been making espresso at home for the past 5 years on a Breville Barista Express, and it’s been an amazing machine to learn on. I mostly make milk drinks and can pull a pretty solid shot—overall, I’m happy with it!

But lately, I’ve been diving deeper into the coffee rabbit hole. And while my setup is definitely good enough, I can’t stop wondering: could it be even better?

That tantalizing possibility has me thinking…
Would upgrading to a separate grinder and espresso machine really take my coffee to the next level? I know it opens up more control and potential for quality—but also more work, more steps, and a steeper learning curve.

On the flip side, something like the Breville Oracle line is super appealing too. It promises a better cup and automates a lot of the process. That’s a big plus when I’m making multiple drinks for friends or just want great coffee without the hassle.

So I’d love to hear from those of you who’ve been down this road:
	•	Is the leap to a dedicated grinder + machine setup really worth it, flavor-wise?
	•	What (if anything) do you lose in automation with something like the Oracle?
	•	Any tips for deciding between simplicity and full control?

Any advice, experience, or insight would be hugely appreciated—thanks in advance!",1,1748141285.0,espresso,2,0.67,False

⸻

I’m Maddi, and I’m just really grateful to be part of this space. I believe in the quiet magic of snail mail — how a card from a stranger can bring a little light into a heavy week. 💌

I’ll genuinely appreciate any card you feel called to send. That said, if you’re someone who likes knowing what makes someone’s heart smile, here’s a peek into mine:

🪴🌙✨

* I love tea (black tea, chai, peppermint, anything cozy with milk and sugar)

* Big fan of nature, bones & skulls, frogs, butterflies, and weird little trinkets

* I love poetry, books, and the color purple! 

* I’m sapphic-bisexual 💜💙🩷🧡 and this is my first year being out for pride! 🌈

* I could be described as dark academia meets alternative/grunge and New Age witchcraft

* My birthday is in August (summer birthday, yeah!)

* I collect random bits — pressed flowers, fortunes from cookies, bottle caps, that kind of thing, most of which are for my junk journal

* Pandas are my favorite animal, and I also love goats, dogs, cats, horses, and penguins

* I’m into bookstores, coffee shops, and thrift/antique stores

* Anything that feels a little witchy or vintage makes me happy

* I’m currently married and have a wonderful daughter

* My favorite kind of weather is the kind where you want to wrap up in a blanket with a cup of something warm

* I love plants, anything to do with space/stars/the moon, and just outdoors in general! 

🪴🌙✨

I keep every card for forever. If you write a long message, I’ll definitely read every word (twice). I love hearing about what makes people *them* — so feel free to ramble.

I also always try to send thank-you cards in return, so if you’d like one then make sure to send me your address! 

Thank you for even considering sending something! 💫 You’re amazing!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748140716.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1kus7ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kus7ch/ms_i_didnt_have_a_choice/,[MS] I Didn't Have a Choice,"There are things you can live with. And then there’s what I did. I did something I could live with.

I was working overnights at a wildlife rehabilitation center on the edge of a national forest. I’m not going to say which one—some of you will try to find it, and trust me, **you don’t want to go looking**.

We mostly got raccoons, opossums, injured birds. Nothing dramatic. That night, the lights in the hallway flickered around 2:35 AM. I remember the exact time because I had just made a fresh cup of coffee, and the flickering made me spill some on my wrist. Slightly scalding the sensitive flesh. I was swearing and wiping it off when I heard the front buzzer go off.

Which was weird. Because we don’t get walk-ins; not this late at night anyways. We don’t even have a public-facing entrance. The park itself is tucked away so that the animals aren’t disturbed by the loud passing traffic.

I checked the monitor. Static. Just static.

I buzzed open the gate anyway. I don’t know why. Maybe I wanted it to be something different. I’d been bored for weeks, and loneliness warps the part of your brain that’s supposed to scream **“don’t do it, dumbass.”**

The man who came in wasn’t... right. He was awkwardly tall…  too tall for the doorway, even had to duck to get in. His coat looked like it was soaked in river mud, and he smelled like ozone and iron. Like a thunderstorm that got lost and found its way inside a dead thing. It was truly something awful.

“I have a delivery,” he said.

I blinked. “This is a wildlife rehab facility.”

“It was wounded,” he said. “You fix the wounded.”

He handed me a crate. I don’t remember saying yes, but I took it. His fingers were too long, and they lingered on the box when I pulled it away. Like he didn’t want to let go.

When I looked down, I swear the crate *shifted*. Something inside it *moved*. I heard a scraping noise, that sounded like claws dragging against wood.

He left without a word. I didn’t hear the door open, but he was gone anyway.

I should’ve left it alone. I should’ve called animal control or burned it or thrown it in the river. But I opened it.

Inside was a creature I can’t fully describe. It looked half-formed, like it had been stitched together from things that didn’t belong together. A deer’s face, but with long, mashing teeth. Human like hands where one would expect his paws to be. Empty, black eyes that **blinked sideways**.

It was whimpering. It sounded like a child.

I didn’t have a choice.

I fed it.

I kept it in the back room. It grew fast. Too fast. And it learned my face. It began to *smile* when it saw me.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

The worst part was the dreams. Dreams of places that weren’t places—of **trees that bled**, of **moons that whispered**, of **my own voice speaking languages I’ve never known**.

Last week, it spoke my name. Out loud. Clear as anything. It’s voice was something ethereal and haunting. A sound that most people would cringe or cower just out of instinct.

Then it said, “Now you’ll carry me.”

And I am.

It lives in me now. In my head, my bones, my breath. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. It feeds on regret and **it’s always full.**

I didn’t have a choice. That’s what I tell myself every night before I shut off the lights and feel it stretch inside me.

But you do. If you ever see a man at your door with a box...

Had I been so consumed by work that I had missed out on the brief yet radiant moments that were happening around me? A fleeting sense of self-reflection passed through me. Looking back, there were certainly memories that made me smile.

The moments when we shared food brought from Korea, comforting our longing for home, and the times spent soothing each other's hearts. The taste of grilled meat and kimchi fried rice, savored at the Korean restaurant in camp after reaching a project milestone, still lingers vividly in my memory.

The dark Turkish coffee I drank during meetings at the vendor’s office—sweetened by a generous amount of sugar in a paper cup the size of a soju glass—was a small, unexpected comfort. Another time, a chai tea latte, thick with condensed milk, offered some solace to my weary soul.

I also recall the days we went out for meals with colleagues. The moments when we set aside the weight of work, talking freely, made me deeply appreciate that we were all comrades, moving forward with a shared goal.

There were weekends when I took short trips to Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, and neighboring countries like Bahrain and Qatar. Walking through unfamiliar cities and gazing at new landscapes, I felt my tense heart loosen, even if just for a moment.

And then there were the unexpected, small moments of emotional impact. I vividly remember a Thursday night at the Starbucks in Hofuf, a city near the site, when a young Saudi girl approached me with a shy smile and said, ""I've never met a Korean before."" Her innocent, bright smile brought me a joy I hadn’t anticipated, and it became an unforgettable memory.

Looking back now, all of these fragments of memories were the warm lights hiding between the hardships. At the time, I hadn’t fully realized it, but now I see that it was these precious moments that allowed me to endure without crumbling.

Even in the midst of struggle, these quietly shining fragments of happiness helped lift me back up. Through all the hard times, those warm glimmers remained steadfast within me.

Though the time was long and arduous, it was these ‘pieces of joy’ that helped me make it to where I am now.",1,1748140214.0,u_lazy_kungfu_ant,0,1.0,False

That was all we had left. The mantra seared into our minds after the transit—those of us who survived it, anyway. It looped endlessly, a grim lullaby echoing in the hollows of our skulls for days, maybe weeks. Hard to tell. Time doesn't behave here.

I jolted awake, cold air biting at my skin. My fingers instinctively closed around the rifle beside me. Panic had become as common as hunger. Some mornings it felt like a heart attack just to wake up. Today, a few deep breaths were enough to keep it from spiraling.

As usual, my body felt like it weighed a ton. Every movement was a chore. The grass beneath me was damp, clinging to me with the chill of dew-soaked socks.
""Always bring two pairs of socks, kid."" Dad's old hunting wisdom. I missed those days—him, the porch, his stein of Heineken. Maybe he’d be reading Angeline a bedtime story right now. God, I missed those days.

""I’ve got a new theory,"" came a voice to my right—dry, brittle, like a man who hadn’t slept in years. Thomas, of course. He sat cross-legged, notebook in hand, pen pinched between two fingers like some mad scholar.

He’d been on watch. I was supposed to take over, though it wasn’t like I could sleep after waking like that.
""I’ll take the next shift, Tom,"" I muttered, hoping to avoid another descent into his conspiracy rabbit holes.

Naturally, I was wrong.
""What if we’re in a simulation?"" he said, thrusting the notebook toward me. Scribbled notes and half-sketched graphs cluttered the page—chaos disguised as science.

""Think about it. This could be a test. Government-run, maybe. See how well humans adapt to extreme environments—""
""What does it matter?"" I cut him off, pushing the notebook away with a finger. ""I told you, quit with that shit. We’re here. That’s all that matters.""

I saw the hurt in his eyes. Back in the old world, he’d been someone important. A scientist, maybe. Here, titles didn’t mean a damn thing. You were either alive, or dead.

""Try focusing on breaching Sector 8 instead of scribbling in your damn notebook.""
He let out a low whistle—the one he knew I hated.

""It’s not just about surviving, Cas,"" he said quietly. ""We have to go back. This place... it’s not real. It can’t be.""

I gave him a small nod. Not because I agreed, but because I understood. This was how he kept himself sane. Who was I to take that from him?

A sharp jab to my backside jolted me forward.
""Do you two ever shut up?"" Carmen growled, her voice thick with sleep. “A girl needs her beauty rest.”

I stood and gave her a light kick in return—just enough to earn a punch later. Worth it. I slung the rifle over my shoulder.
""I’m doing a sweep. Tom’s got a fresh theory for you,"" I said, grinning as I passed. He didn’t look up.

Despite everything, Tom was good company. In a place like this, that was as essential as food or water. He couldn’t fight worth a damn, though. Carmen and I had dragged his ass out of enough firefights to earn a medal.

The ground crunched under my boots—frost layering everything like powdered glass. The rhythm of it reminded me of Angeline’s violin.
God, what I’d give to hear her play again. I used to yell at her to keep it down. Now? I’d trade Carmen for a single note. Hell, maybe even for a Twix bar.

The thought made me chuckle. Then laugh. Then the laughter turned to sobs. I collapsed, hands and knees in the dirt, tears freezing as they hit the cold ground.

I missed everything. Dad’s cryptic sayings. Angeline’s music. Mom’s burnt coffee and humming on the porch. Bont’s barking in the yard. I missed home.
I would’ve given anything to go back. Anything.

A sound snapped me out of it—boots on frost, coming fast.

I almost called out for Carmen, thinking she’d come to join me. But something was wrong. Too many steps. Too heavy. I dropped to my stomach just in time as boots landed meters from my head.

Five figures, moving in silence. Civilian clothes, like ours—but wrong. Too clean. Too uniform. Each had a crude bronze star pinned to their shoulders, jagged and dull like they’d been carved from a beer can.

Had they tracked us through the maze? Or just ended up here too? Didn’t matter. If we didn’t avoid them, blood would be spilled.

They were close—six, maybe seven meters out. Just five of them. I could probably take the shot. Suppressed barrel, old Russian model. Carmen said it was Spetsnaz-issue. I didn’t care. It worked, and it was quiet. Ammo was rare, but I made do.

I was just about to raise my rifle when four more stepped out from the tree line. They spoke a language none of us knew—not even Tom, and he knew a bit of everything.

Then came eight more, from behind. One nearly stepped on my head.

If not for the darkness, they would’ve seen me. My heart pounded loud enough to be a beacon.

We weren’t alone. Not by a long shot.
I held my breath.

Every muscle in my body screamed to move—to run, to fight, to do something—but I stayed frozen. Still. Just another lump of dirt in the dark. The boot that nearly crushed my skull moved on, its owner none the wiser.

Fourteen. I counted fourteen of them now. Light footsteps, practiced and quiet. These weren’t just random survivors.

Their language rose and fell in sharp tones, clipped and efficient. Orders, maybe. Or names. It didn't matter. The bronze stars on their shoulders gleamed faintly in the moonlight, catching just enough glow to turn them into ghostly sigils. That damn insignia again.

They weren’t like us. Something about the way they moved. Precise. Calculated. As if they'd trained for this.

Sector patrols? Enforcers?

I didn’t want to find out.

My hands shifted, slow as sap in winter, curling around the rifle. I eased the barrel forward, stopping when a twig snapped behind me.

Shit.

Silence.

The conversation stopped. Then came footsteps—deliberate, closing in. I pressed my cheek to the cold ground and forced myself not to breathe.

A beam of light swept the trees to my left. Flashlight. Close.

Another snapped branch. This one directly behind me.

They knew. Or suspected. Either way, I was out of time.

I rolled silently into a prone firing position, angled the barrel just enough to cover the most direct approach. The suppressor would give me a few seconds, maybe, before the others figured out where I was.

I waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Nothing.

Then a face appeared through the brush—pale, young, unshaven. He didn't see me yet. My finger touched the trigger.

Then—

""Cas!""

A whisper. Sharp. Urgent.

I flinched.

It was Carmen’s voice. Somewhere close. Too close.

The young soldier's head whipped toward the sound, eyes narrowing. His hand drifted toward his weapon.

I fired.

The crack was soft, but not silent. The bullet took him clean through the temple. He dropped like a stone.

The world paused.

Then the forest exploded.

Shouts in that guttural language. Boots pounding toward me. Lights cutting through the dark like knives. More of them than I could count now. At least twenty. Maybe thirty. A full unit.

I scrambled up and ran, bullets zipping past me, tearing through the underbrush. Bark and leaves exploded around me. I didn’t shoot back—I didn’t have time to aim. I just ran.

A shadow broke from the trees ahead—Carmen. She waved me down and yanked me behind a tree just as more rounds peppered the ground where I’d been a second before.

“You idiot,” she hissed. “You led ‘em straight to us!”

“I didn’t lead—they found me!”

Tom came sprinting through the trees behind her, clutching that damn notebook like it was a child. ""They’re everywhere!"" he yelled. “Whole damn perimeter is compromised!”

“No shit, Sherlock!” Carmen snapped. She raised her rifle, fired two clean shots into the darkness. Someone screamed. One less star on the shoulder.

“We fall back to the stream!” I barked. “Now!”

No one argued.

We ran—lungs burning, hearts pounding loud enough to drown out thought. Trees blurred past in streaks of black and gray, their skeletal limbs clawing at our clothes and skin. Every step was a gamble: a hidden root, a jagged stone, the uneven ground soaked in dew and blood from god-knows-what. The forest became a blur of motion, an obstacle course designed by some cruel higher power.

Gunfire cracked behind us, sharp and rapid, followed by the whip of bullets tearing through branches overhead. Bark exploded in splinters around us. One passed so close to my ear I felt the heat of its wake, like the hiss of a passing ghost.

Carmen, behind us, moved like a predator in retreat—graceful, fast, but deadly. She paused only to spin and fire short, controlled bursts into the shadows, each shot echoing a grim promise. Every time a pursuer got too bold, too close, she corrected their mistake with precision. One man dropped with a scream that choked halfway through. Another fell without a sound, his body thudding against the leaves like dropped meat.

Tom, for all his genius, wasn’t made for this. He stumbled over a low root and went sprawling face-first into the dirt, a breathless curse tumbling from his lips. I reached back, grabbed the strap of his coat, and yanked him to his feet without stopping. The notebook was still clutched in his hands, somehow untouched—his lifeline, his scripture. He held onto it tighter than he held onto his rifle, and that said a lot.

He tripped again—this time on loose gravel—and nearly took me down with him. But he didn’t let go of the damn notebook.

“Priorities, Tom!” Carmen shouted, ducking a low-hanging branch as she laid down another burst of fire.

“I’m fine!” he gasped, already scrambling upright, eyes wild, glasses askew. “It’s all in here—I need it!”

“Then maybe next time carry it in your damn bag!” she yelled, but didn’t slow down.

The woods thinned slightly, opening just enough to give the illusion of space. Moonlight painted streaks of silver across the floor, only making it easier for the men behind us to see. I could hear them gaining—boots pounding in synchrony, shouting to each other in clipped syllables that sounded like static and steel.

Then came the scream of a flare, bright red and hissing as it arced over the trees behind us, bathing everything in bloodlight. Our shadows stretched and danced beneath us like demons on puppet strings. Now we weren’t just fleeing—we were hunted.

Carmen turned on the run, knelt mid-stride, and fired three sharp shots into the darkness. One hit flesh. The resulting howl sent a chill down my spine.

“Move!” she barked, rising again. “They’re trying to box us in!”

I pushed harder, lungs drawing ragged air as pain bloomed in my ribs. My thighs burned. My arms ached. But I didn’t stop.

None of us did.
Because stopping meant dying.
And we weren’t ready for that.
Not yet.

Ahead, I saw the shimmer of water.

The stream.

We dove into it without hesitation, the freezing current dragging at our legs, soaking us to the bone. We pushed across, lungs burning, and ducked behind a rocky outcrop on the far side. It wasn’t perfect cover, but it would do.
For now.

Panting. Wet. Alive.
We sat in the dark, listening to the chaos fade behind us—distant shouts, the occasional gunshot, then silence.

Carmen spat into the dirt. “They weren’t just scouts,” she said. “That was a sweep. Full operation.”

“They’ve been tracking us,” I said. “Probably since we left the maze.”

Tom hugged his notebook to his chest. “That confirms it. This is all controlled. They’re watching. They want to see how we react.”

Carmen stared at him like she was considering throwing him back into the stream.

“You still think this is some kind of experiment?” she growled. “People are dying, Tom.”

“And that’s exactly what they want,” he whispered. “Reaction under stress. Breakdown of human psychology under continuous threat. We’re rats in a cage.”

“Rats don’t shoot back,” I muttered.

We sat in silence after that. The wind picked up, cold and sharp, carrying the scent of smoke and gunpowder.

I looked down at my hands. They were shaking.

Fight. Survive. Endure.

That mantra echoed again, dull and rhythmic.

First, i only had 2 hours of sleep. I only ate half a banana for breakfast. Then, i was in the sun for 2 hours, then i got a coffee, and then i was in the what again for another hour. I ate some food and i was drinking water as well, i was feeling light headed and dizzy in the sun the whole time. Then when i get to my car, i leave, and as im driving, my chest starts getting a bit tight and i had a very uncomfortable pressure, my anxiety starts coming and i start panicking, i pulled off the high way and i parked near the hospital. It took me 45 minutes of chat gpt to calm me down. My heart rate was around 140, I’ve been resting since then, my heart rate is still a bit elevated. 

I know for a fact that i have heat intolerance, and i have caffeine induced anxiety. Today was just a recipe for symptoms. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",1,1748139869.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False

I'm here looking for general conversation and potential new friendships. I'm going to be up a bit later than usual tonight so I thought I'd see if anyone is around and feels like passing the time chatting.

about me: I'm 28 and from the eastern united states. I'm a huge nerd for entomology, paleontology, and marine biology. I love learning about animals and the natural world. I spend my time birdwatching in parks and gardens, visiting museums, hanging out in quiet cafes. I like crafting and have been making my own plushies by hand for more than a decade. I enjoy gaming and have over 4k hours in one of my favorite games. I love music and listen to a wide variety of genres, and I also really enjoy a good music video. I like hello kitty, theme park history, iced coffee, sunrises early in the morning, and vintage arcades.

So I was looking on Ninjatrader to potentially subscribe to ICE Nybot data to start trading ICE products, coffee and cocoa mainly, and noticed it says ""For Continuum connections only, mobile and web connections are not live data"".

I'm familiar with Continuum inside Ninjatrader, however I primarily trade from web and mobile and just curious if there's any way around this. Ninja has the lowest ICE margins I've found and I'd like to remain there. 

I was also thinking of moving to Ironbeam full time but their ICE margins aren't listed so I'm not sure what they are, and they haven't answered my email.

I checked around at different brokers and Ninja was lowest day margin for softs I could find, Ironbeam being the next closest when I called them.

I’m 20F i’ve been working at my waitressing job for a couple months now. I have a family that became pretty attached to me. a husband and wife (43&44) and their two daughters (8&5) always request to have me. at first i thought it was nice to have a family come visit a lot but then things kind of took a turn… the second time i served then i told them i was going on vacation for 2 weeks & the mother asked for my number so she could text me when i got back so they could know when to come in. i thought it was a little bit odd but i just figured they were so kind to me and they always tipped 50-100% so it didn’t phase me too much. When i arrived back from vacation they all came and hugged me and would start telling me about what’s new in their lives. the mom told me she had a little bit of health problems. i offered to help bring a meal over and they accepted. after that i would get texts everyday- every other day sometimes asking about my schedule other times sending pictures of their kids and updating me on their day. they have asked me if i wanted to get dinner with them or coffee. they’ve joked about me moving in with them and they want me to babysit their kids but the kids aren’t super fond to me. the husband will call me love and beautiful and he privately texted me asking if i could “be a friend to his wife” & “be a voice of reason”. i am really naive when it comes to these things i don’t want to think the worst in people but at the same time- theres a 23 year age gap and i just don’t understand why they would want to be friends with a waitress. is this borderline grooming lol?,1,1748139643.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False
1kurx61,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1kurx61/my_partner_is_not_who_i_expected/,My partner is not who I expected.,"As the title says my partner isn’t what I expected of him 3 years when we first met. Everything was fine at first I was newly 18, I flew to a middle eastern country to meet him (since he’s middle eastern) my first visit there, he got upset over a message in my phone to my best friend (a female) about lingerie, and pulled me by my hair from one side of the Airbnb I was in to the other, at which point when he left immediately after this, I broke down on the floor bawling my eyes out for hours, he came back apologized brought me my favorite coffee and donuts. I also want to mention weight in this because I was 280 pounds at this time and he was 160 so easily I could have fought back, but it’s never been in my nature to fight back or even have to handle this kind of situation. I’ve been cheated on multiple times by him weather it be online talking to women, or it be in person meeting her, which I don’t think he ever sexually did anything with them, but I’m not sure my gut tells me otherwise since the beginning. I’ve confronted the betrayals multiple times and even mentioned how I don’t trust him, and I don’t think I’ll ever be ready to trust him. Following up with this, there has been multiple cases of our fights becoming physical, I don’t want to call it abuse because never has he punched me, but has left several big bruises, never any blood. Even after I had a major surgery, and he seen me fighting for my life just a few weeks later the physical fights started again. I’ve gone to the hospital once over our fight, just a bone contusion nothing more, but it hurt really bad!! This is all taken place in his country. He doesn’t work and hasn’t for 2 years, he did work when I first met him but a few months later quit that job. I’ve been responsible for the bills, and the upkeep of the house, along with his parents. I’ve been responsible for gas in cars, food, clothes for us. You name it I’ve been paying for it for 2 years, the back in fourth between the U.S my country and his country as well. I’m now 21, 140 pounds I am pregnant, halfway there, well when I first found out, and shared it with him, he was shocked…but he took it well. Fast forward a month or two we got into a physical fight and I decided to leave because I wasn’t going to be put in a situation that could harm my child. We moved to an apartment just a week before I left back to the U.S, I pay the rent atleast 75% of it each month even now. However I don’t pay for the usual stuff I do when I’m there thankfully. However I came back here for the safety of my baby, and to give birth here. We agreed he was going to get a job, and save money for our child same as me. However, I’ve had a difficult pregnancy and haven’t been able to work I still have an income from attending college, so I am able to provide for myself. I’ve managed to buy everything I need for my baby, and even start a savings account for them, it may not be much but my child comes first. He has not bought the first thing for the child, or even gotten a job. I’m due in a few months. I’m supposed to fly back over once the babies here, and he wants our child to have his last name which is his right. However I am very hesitant on what to do, in my mind I am scared to take my child back, with the laws being different and have my child taken away. I am also hesitant to give the baby his last name because of the issues him and I have, and I don’t want my baby wrapped up in that if anything were to happen. I’m not sure what to do at this point. He said he would sue me if I took his child, or didn’t give the child his last name, which I’m only 21 and doing the best I can financially, barely getting by and providing for my baby. I don’t know how much grounds he has across the sees to sue me over the child. Or even where to begin on what I should do and how to handle this situation. I’m just scared, I know in my heart I would be better off a single mom, but I’m scared of him suing me, and his country being how it is, him winning custody and I’ll never see my child again. If anyone has been in a similar situation, please let me know how you handled it :/ 


Edit to add : nobody knows about the physical issues we’ve had not even my parents, only his parents know and have seen it. I do have pictures of every bruise and mark left after the fights. ",0,1748139642.0,BabyBumps,24,0.38,False

1kurwrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kurwrp/aitah_sweet_revenge_on_my_cheating_girlfriends/,AITAH - Sweet revenge on my cheating girlfriend's boyfriend's Harley Davidson...,"So here’s how I turned betrayal into a glitter-fueled masterpiece.

I was with my girlfriend for three years. I genuinely thought we were solid. Then one day, completely out of the blue, a mutual friend dropped the bomb: she’d been cheating on me. For a while. With a guy who called himself “Wolf.” Yeah. That was his actual nickname. He rode a Harley, wore sunglasses indoors, and seemed to believe he was some kind of lone-wolf biker poet. You can’t make this stuff up.

At first, I didn’t even react. I just let it sit. Quiet rage, slow-brewing. They went public soon after, all couple selfies, captioned quotes about “freedom” and “finding your true ride.” It was laughable. But then I noticed she was still using me for little things, favors, stuff she’d left at my place, the occasional “can you help me move this?” message. And one day she casually mentioned that Wolf had left his Harley parked at her place, the place we used to share, while they went away for the weekend.

I didn’t say much. I just nodded. But that night,  I went to where he parked the bike. Under a tree. No cameras. Barely any streetlights. Perfect.

Armed with a rainbow spectrum of spray paint, industrial super glue, and a creative vengeance that had been simmering for weeks, I made my move. I gave that Harley the unicorn transformation it never knew it needed. I layered it in brilliant rainbow gradients, blending pink, gold, teal, and violet into a surreal wash of sparkle. I glued rainbow streamers to the seat and handlebars, cascading like a proud mane in the moonlight. Then, and this was the pièce de résistance, I superglued a massive pink dildo to the front headlight. His own unicorn horn, majestic and unignorable.

I wasn’t done. I attached tiny bells to every spoke so that even if he tried to ride it, it would jingle like a cursed ice cream truck. Then I painted over the license plate in big, bold white: I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU HARD.

When they got back the next morning and saw the bike, it was like watching a dream die in slow motion. He stood there, completely still. She just kept saying “Oh my God” over and over like a broken Roomba. I was parked just up the road, sipping coffee, enjoying the sunrise and the sweet, sweet sound of justice.

From what I hear, Wolf hasn’t touched the bike since. Apparently, every time he looks at it, he sees the horn.

And that, friends, is how you turn heartbreak into art.

1kurwnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1kurwnx/the_only_musclebuilding_guide_youll_ever_need_no/,The Only Muscle-Building Guide You’ll Ever Need (No BS),"# DIET: How Many Calories Do You Need?

**Find your maintenance calories:**

**Bodyweight (lbs) × 14 - 18**

* ×14 → Sedentary  
* ×15-16 → Light activity / 3-4 training days per week  
* ×17-18 → High activity / 5-7 training days per week  

**If you’re bulking:** add 300-500 calories**If you’re cutting:** subtract 300-500 calories

⚠️ *These are estimates — track your weight and adjust every 1-2 weeks based on progress.*



# PROTEIN, FATS & CARBS (Simplified)

* **Protein:** 0.7-1g per lb (1.6-2.2g per kg) of bodyweight daily  
* **Fats:** 0.3-0.4g per lb  
* **Carbs:** Fill the rest of your calories with carbs  

Prioritize whole foods, but it's okay to be flexible.

# WATER INTAKE

**30-45 ml × kg of bodyweight per day**

 Increase on hot days or intense training sessions. A good rule: your pee should be light yellow.

# SLEEP (The Most Underrated Factor)

**7-9 hours of quality sleep per night**

**Tips for better sleep:**

* No screens 30-60 min before bed  
* Dark, cool room  
* Same sleep schedule every day

# TRAINING: How to Structure It

**Train 3-4 times per week.** More isn’t better — better is better. Pick a split you can stick to for months.



# Best Training Split for Beginners:

**Upper / Lower Split — 4 Days a Week**

**Upper 1:** Chest & Back **Lower 1:** Quads focus, 1 hamstring exercise

**Upper 2:** Arms, Shoulders & Forearms **Lower 2:** Hamstrings focus, 1 quad exercise

**Why an entire day for arms?** Arms recover fast and thrive on high volume + high intensity + short rest.

# TRAINING DETAILS (Volume, Rest, Frequency)

# ARMS:

* **Biceps:** 16 sets  
* **Triceps:** 16 sets  
* **Rest:** 30 sec between sets  
* **Reps:** 10-20  
* **Intensity:** All sets to failure  
* **Frequency:** 1-2× per week  
* Use dropsets, supersets, bi- and tri-sets.  

# FOREARMS:

* **10 sets wrist curls + 10 sets wrist extensions**  
* **Reps:** 15-20  
* **Frequency:** 4× per week or daily  

# SHOULDERS:

* **4 sets per head (front, lateral, rear)**  
* **Rest:** 45-70 sec  
* **Reps:** 10-15  
* Use dropsets: a dropset counts as 1 set, even if you lower the weight 5 times.  

**Frequency:** 2-4× per week Tip: Sneak shoulder exercises into chest, back, or leg sessions between sets.

# LEGS:

* **Quads:** 3 exercises, 2 sets each to failure  
* **Hamstrings:** Same  
* **Calves:** 10-30 sets to failure, 30 sec rest  
* **Anterior Tibialis:** Light weight, 15-20 reps, 5 sets, 1 min rest  

**Pro tip:** Use both bent-leg and straight-leg calf movements for full development.

# CHEST:

Notice where you feel sore after benching. If you only feel it in the upper/middle chest → you’re missing out on total development. Train incline, flat, and dips for complete growth.

# BACK:

* **Upper Back:** Elbows out and away  
* **Lats:** Elbows in, close to the torso  
* **Overall Back Thickness:** Deadlifts, hip hyperextensions  

**Always retract and depress your scapula on pulls and presses.**

# COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES:

* Not training with enough intensity  
* Chasing novelty over consistency  
* Poor form (form > weight, always)  
* Not progressively overloading (increase weight, reps, or density over time)  
* No sustainable plan  
* Ignoring recovery (sleep, food, water)  

# KEEP IN MIND:

* **It takes time.** Nothing happens overnight.  
* **Track your progress.** Log your lifts and weight weekly.  
* **Be consistent.** Don’t skip weeks and expect results.  
* **The plan should fit YOU.** Not the other way around.

**TRACK YOUR PROGRESS:**

* Track weight, reps, and rest times  
* Optional: track body weight weekly (average across 3-7 days)  
* Optional: take pictures every 4-6 weeks  

If you’re progressing in the gym (adding weight, reps, or reducing rest while maintaining form) — you’re on the right track.

# SUPPLEMENTS (NEED-TO-KNOW)

**You don’t need supplements.** If your diet is on point, you’re good.

Optional:

* **Whey protein** (if hitting daily protein is hard)  
* **Creatine monohydrate** (5g daily, safe and effective)  
* **Preworkout** (or simply a strong coffee)  

That’s it. No magic pills.

# MYTHBUSTING

**Can I lose fat and build muscle at the same time?** Yes

**How long until I see results?** Noticeable changes: 8-12 weeks Big changes: 1-2 years A great physique: 3-5 years

**Is cardio bad for muscle?**No. It improves recovery and heart health. Just don’t overdo it.

**Should I bulk or cut first?** If you’re skinny-fat → lean bulk. If you’re overweight → cut. If you’re lean → bulk.

# 📌 FINAL WORD:

Everything here — calorie formulas, water intake, volume — is a starting point. **Experiment, track, and adjust.**

If you’re getting stronger over time and your physique is improving, you’re doing it right.

**This is the most complete, no-bullshit beginner guide you’ll find online. Save it, live it, and you’ll build a great physique.**
