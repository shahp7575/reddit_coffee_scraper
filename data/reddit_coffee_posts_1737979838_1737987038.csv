I‚Äôm stuck between two activities to plan during a certain day. I think with everything else we have booked, we will have to cut one activity completely. We will be in La Fortuna from February 10th to 13th. As of now I have Maquique Rappelling Adventure, 2 day pass at the Springs (mostly for later afternoon/evening), and Northfields coffee tour officially booked. 
The itinerary so far is..

10th
Come in from Fraijanes area (having done Catarata Del Toro/Blue Falls hike) and starting The Springs 2 day pass that evening

11th
Northfields Coffee at 8AM

Hopefully La Fortuna waterfall afterwards

Second afternoon/evening of The Springs

12th
Maquique Rappelling at 7AM
Around 3.5 hours

***Debating on 3:00PM Pura Vida Cooking Class or Mistico guided hanging bridges tour(Last reservation is 2PM)** 


I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews on the hanging bridges tour. I think the major reason for the hanging bridges would be for animal sighting but I feel we would have that during the other tours we have booked PLUS we are also doing Zip lining in Manuel Antonio Park. I‚Äôm leaning more towards the cooking class but I would love any suggestions if we can fit both in the trip if Mistico really deserves to be in the trip or even if Mistico would be the better option!

1ib9ino,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChilluminatiPod/comments/1ib9ino/the_cuckoo_clock_good_to_read_on_pod/,The Cuckoo Clock (good to read on pod),"Hey everyone, longtime fan of the show. I feel like I may have posted this story years ago during the pandemic but I can‚Äôt remember and don‚Äôt have access to my old account anymore for whatever reason, so here goes. 
To start, I should say that I‚Äôm more of an Alex. I‚Äôm pretty chill about everything in the paranormal realm. I‚Äôve seen some things in my life I can‚Äôt explain but I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôm a hardline believer in some of the insane stuff out there, although it would be cool if it was real(as long as the theories aren‚Äôt hurting anyone).
So around 10 years ago, my family moved to Florida to be closer to my grandfather who was sick. He was terminal and he knew that eventually his time would come. My mom would routinely go to my grandparents house to help them organize stuff and get their affairs in order. My grandpa was always very practical and kept saying ‚Äúwhen I go, don‚Äôt keep anything. It‚Äôs just stuff‚Äù, and we agreed. 
Over the next year and a half he seemed like he was doing well through treatments, but he took a turn for the worse. My uncle flew down to be there when he passed.
One night I was sound asleep, but around 3 in the morning I shot awake unable to breathe. I sat up gasping for breath and gripping my chest. After a minute I was able to calm myself and I eventually went back to sleep. The next morning I got up to find my mom sitting at the kitchen table alone. I said good morning and went to get some breakfast. She looked rattled and told me that my grandpa had passed in the night. She said she had woken up not able to breathe about 2 minutes before her phone rang and when I asked what time it was she said around 3 am. I was stunned. I told her what had happened to me and she was shocked and silent. A few minutes later my uncle, who was staying with us came back from getting coffee complaining that he had woken up in the middle of the night. My mom asked him what time and he also said around 3 am. It felt too weird to be a coincidence.  
The next day my mom was sitting in the living room wiping dust off of a cuckoo clock, and I asked where she got it. My grandpa had gotten it when he was in the military and stationed in Europe. When he came home, he brought this handcrafted cuckoo clock for the house. It was very high quality and my mom always loved it. She said she knew he wanted her to get rid of everything but she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to get rid of the clock. She took it into her closet and stored it on a deep shelf very securely behind a couple of heavy items so she could figure out what to do with it later. Not ten minutes later while we‚Äôre having dinner, we hear a loud crash. We all rush in and find the clock shattered on the floor. Not broken and repairable, shattered into hundreds of tiny pieces. My mom stared at the pile and said ‚Äúwell I guess that makes my decision for me,‚Äù and starts laughing. 
My grandpa was a very kind, caring man but hated sentimentality. We just figured this situation was him saying bye on the way out, then telling my mom to not keep anything after he was gone.
Love the show, keep it up!

Prepare to Leave Your Comfort Zone,"I spent five years in a stable corporate role, climbing the ladder and earning a decent paycheck. On paper, it looked like I was doing great. But behind the scenes, I felt stuck, like my days blurred into a cycle of meetings, deadlines, and a constant, quiet frustration.

One day, after another sleepless night, I asked myself: *Is this really it?* 

The answer hit me hard. **It wasn‚Äôt.**

So, I made a bold move. With six months of savings and no backup plan, I quit.

The first morning without a job was surreal. I sat with my coffee and realized I finally owned my time. No emails to check, no meetings to dread. Just freedom and honestly? A little fear.

The first month was rough as I didn't scared of digging into my saved up cash, I just ate cheap groceries, questioning my decision daily. But instead of spiraling, I decided to channel my energy into building something of my own.

I started with small projects I‚Äôd always dreamed of but never had the courage to pursue. The first couple flopped, but by the third month, I launched something I actually felt proud of: a digital tool to help small businesses automate their workflows.

Three weeks after launching, I saw my first payment notification: $49. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it meant everything. Someone believed in my work enough to pay for it.

That was my turning point. I doubled down, refined my product, and shared it with as many people as I could. Sales trickled in at first, but within six months, my tool covered my living expenses.

Now, looking back, I realize that leaving my job wasn‚Äôt just about walking away from a paycheck. It was about reclaiming my purpose and betting on myself.

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck, ask yourself this: What‚Äôs scarier, failing or never trying? For me, the answer was clear.

She drinks it straight, but she also loves adding it to everything, including drinks. One of her favourites is soda water with vinegar, but she has even done it to CHOCOLATE MILK and enjoyed it.

A couple weeks ago in a mix up she determined she does not like coffee though, and it's become one of those things she focusses on. Basically every morning there's some variant of ""mommy's so silly for drinking yucky coffee"".

1. My machine said it needed descaling, but i don't have the descaling solution yet. While trying to change the temp for my espresso shot, i accidentally initiated the descaling procedure(?) and it hence did so with no descaling solution. How do i initiate it again if there is no ""alarm""? Maybe i'm reading with my nose but i can't seem to find it in the manual. 
2. Talking about descaling, it says i need to buy ""solipol"" in particular. Does it actually matter or will any reputable espresso machine descaler work?
3. While saving some money for a proper grinder, i buy illy pre-ground coffee which used to give me between 9-13 bars of pressure. Lately, the pressure i get from a 18 gram shot is more like 8 bars. It also builds up pressure really slowly and it seems that it's already halfway through the shot before it even reaches that. I weigh my coffee grounds, i tamp accordingly, i (try to) distribute the grounds evenly in the basket using a couple needles / cheapy spinny thing i got from temu, and i have a grounds distribution to make the tamping surface nice and even before you press. What am i doing wrong? Or is my machine being weird?

In an effort to identify the root cause of my SIBO (I know I have it, but I‚Äôm not really sure which type, and I think I might have a combination), I decided to do a test to check my transit time.

I believe I suffer from constipation, or slow motility, or at least incomplete stools. If you'd like more details about my situation, here's a link : [https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1i88uu0/i\_need\_your\_help\_advice\_feedback\_answers\_anything/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1i88uu0/i_need_your_help_advice_feedback_answers_anything/)

Two days ago, after a bowel movement, I drank a glass of water with two teaspoons of whole sesame seeds, obviously without chewing them. The goal was to see how long it would take for it to appear in my stool.

(For your information, I‚Äôve been taking 2 ginger and 2 artichoke capsules every morning on an empty stomach with a large glass of water (for about 1.5 weeks), followed by a coffee 15 minutes later. I eat healthily, avoid FODMAPs as much as possible but without too many restrictions. I space my meals at least 4 hours apart, drink 2 liters of water per day, and have a marshmallow root tea every night before bed.)

The sesame seeds appeared whole in my stool 48 hours after ingestion, in two separate bowel movements, one hour apart. **Can we consider this a long transit time, or is it relatively normal? Why the separate BM one hour apart ?** 

Something else happened. About 30 hours after taking the sesame seeds, I started having a lot of foul-smelling gas, and it lasted the entire evening. Because i've been suffering for a long time, I‚Äôm used to having gas, sometimes foul-smelling, sometimes with no odor, but since i started ginger and artichoke extracts i felt like I had much less gas of any type. This time, it was a lot. **I‚Äôm wondering if it was triggered by the sesame seeds, and if so, what might this indicate about my condition?**

1ib956l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ib956l/aio_my_boyfriend_jerked_off_one_night_on_bumble/,AIO my boyfriend jerked off one night on bumble,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 year and 3 months now. Everything was great, I had a good feeling about everything, he was so attentive, always wanted to talk about everything, constantly showed how much he loved me. He didn't go out anywhere that much, if he does, it's sometimes for coffee for an hour and then home. I never had a bad feeling that he would ever cheat on me. Already at the beginning of the relationship, he put my Face ID on his phone and said he have nothing to hide from me. 

One day I took his  phone and unlocked it, and before that he was in the photos looking for something, as soon as I unlocked the phone and it was in the photos where he stopped. I was shocked because I saw 2 photos of a woman in sexy clothes. I'm a panicker by the way and I immediately asked what this was. He said that he took it off so he could jerk off and that he liked the outfit and would like me to wear something like that someday. Then he said from which site he downloaded those photos, for free. He used to have profiles on everything where he could jerk off, since he was free. He immediately went to the site and gave me the phone to review. I investigated in detail, he never paid anything, I reviewed the transactions. 

He told me many times that he would like to have my sexy photos so that he can jerk off sometime or we can make a video together. Or like when we were talking on the phone once and he jerked off like that. I didn't take anything seriously. I avoided doing it. I don't know why. He was in a long relationship then broke up because she cheated on him. His mom told me that he came crying and saying ""How many of them was she with"" and went to get tested. After her, he went out with a girl once more and he didn't like it and didn't want to continue. He decided to be alone and jerk off. 

At the beginning of our relationship, he deleted all the girls from Instagram and said I don't need it. Later, he also deleted everyone from Facebook. He never followed a girl, added, liked that I saw. Then he deleted Instagram and Facebook. Deleted tiktok and everything. 

The following situation is happening recently. On the banking application (I have access to his account), I saw 14.99e that he paid for something from the Apple store. I asked him what it was. He said bumble premium. I was shocked and asked why you entered that and took the premium. He said because he was jerking off. He got an ad on the game and he clicked to see if his profile was still there. He entered inside took premium so he could browse, see who liked him (because he needed that to boost his confidence) and after jerking off he was investigating if I was using bumble. He says he immediately deleted the app after that because he immediately realized he shouldn't have done that. And when he admitted it to me, he immediately downloaded the application and let me take a look. There were his old pictures, old chats before our relationship, and in the section where it says what he is looking for, it said: one committed relationship. He took that premium only in 7 days, the shortest possible time. He says that he is used to scrolling like that before, and when he comes across someone in a bikini or dressed in sexy clothes, he stops and jerks off and then continues scrolling. 

My world collapsed because I trusted him so much and I never thought it would come to this. He said it was sick how addicted he was to jerking off. And that he was looking for different ways to do it. He says that he got tired of jerking off in the same way, so he jerked off that way. He says he used to do that on Instagram and Facebook, but he doesn't have that apps anymore. I didn't find anything on that bumble profile, no sign of anything. But he came to me himself and admitted that he liked all the women because they swiped to the right because it was easier for him and because he had done it that way before. He swears by everything that he never thought that he wanted something with someone, that he never had contact or anything more than that. He wants to take a polygraph because he doesn't want to lose me. He realizes that he hurt me, made a mistake and is working on it because he is aware of his problem. 

In every possible way, he proves that he never did anything. He changed iCloud, created a new one, deleted all profiles, gave access to everything I want. He says that he wants a new start in everything and that he doesn't want to lose me. He's asking me to help him with jerking off. He is otherwise a shy person and the chats that were on bumble before were maybe 12 in total and they were all short like ""Hello"" ""Hello"" ""What's up"" and nothing more than that. He never wrote ""you're hot"" or that he wanted something with someone. He's not that kind of person. There were only 2-3 messages each and that's it. And he always had the opportunity to have sex when he was single, he didn't want to because he wasn't interested in it. But he jerked her off in every possible way.

The party consists of 3 level 6 members, 2 fighters and a bard but they're bringing 3 allied NPCs with them

The dungeon is a gun factory that the party wants to shut down. For story reasons they're also working with ilithid 

Here's what I have planned:

1. Assembly station:

Various rows of tables where workers are assembling parts to build functional guns
There will be 3 gun slingers and 2 intellect devourers, the rest of the workers aren't armed so will run away 
   
2. Foundry:

A room with large vats of molten metal and shelves of moulds that look to make gun parts
   
   
3. Arms and armour storage:

Have a roleplay encounter here where Ili shoves as many guns as possible into her bag of holding, she wants to supply the good people with firearms so they can eliminate the rest of Harveys men (a villain who enslaves Tieflings and the man who invented guns)
   
4. Parts storage:

Various shelves with cardboard boxes filled with gun parts and materials, there are also barrels of gunpowder
There will be 1 mindflayer and 1 mindwitness
   
5. office:

What was once Harveys office is now temporarily being used by a wizard thrall from the cult of genesis who is being controlled by a mindflayer in the same room
   
6. Lounge:

I eat raw fat from fatty cuts of beef, bone marrow, suet, and brains, if I can get high quality brains. 

Also, of course, you want to start slow with any kind of fat, if you‚Äôre coming from a standard diet. Little by little so you don‚Äôt overwhelm your system.

Recently she started noticing some breast pain and that her periods started getting very irregular. Purely by coincidence, she stopped drinking coffer for a few days and her breast pain got better.

We did some research (mostly by asking ChatGPT) and it responded that there could be some connection.

1. Strong run threatened 

U.S. stocks are poised to drop after recent gains, with AI companies leading premarket declines. Concerns stem from a potential low-cost AI competitor in China. This pullback comes after the S&P 500 hit an intraday record Friday, and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy decision on Wednesday and key earnings reports from AI-heavy ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù stocks are likely to shape the week.
	
2. Deep drop

Shares of Nvidia, Broadcom, and Microsoft fell premarket as Chinese startup DeepSeek announced its low-cost AI model outperformed OpenAI on several benchmarks. JPMorgan analysts highlighted concerns about the U.S. AI investment cycle being ‚Äúover-hyped‚Äù amid these breakthroughs, potentially indicating a shift toward efficiency-focused innovation.
	
3. Tech trove

Major tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla, will report earnings this week. Notable releases:

‚Ä¢ Tuesday: General Motors, Boeing (AM); Starbucks (PM)
‚Ä¢ Wednesday: Meta, Microsoft, Tesla (PM)
‚Ä¢ Thursday: Southwest Airlines, Comcast (AM); Apple, Intel (PM)
‚Ä¢ Friday: Chevron, Exxon Mobil (AM)
	
4. Trade war delayed

A potential U.S.-Colombia trade war was averted after Colombia agreed to accept deportation flights from the U.S. The delay of 25% tariffs has eased investor concerns, particularly for coffee and crude oil markets. However, uncertainties remain about potential tariffs targeting China, Canada, and Mexico.
	
5. Pharma and Trump

The pharmaceutical industry is watching closely as the Trump administration hints at reforms to pharmacy benefit managers and potential adjustments to Medicare drug price negotiations.

SPOILERS AHEAD (S1 up to possibly S2 ep2)

**Season 1**

**Ep 2**

**Timestamp 00:20**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oHelly is recording her video message to her iHelly

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The audio of oHelly in this recording is a ***near perfect*** match to what was shown in S1E1

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† When oHelly says ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù this time, she ***blinks***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick says ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs a wrap‚Äù directly after oHelly says her last word

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs a wrap‚Äù **Time delay**¬† ***EP1***\*\*:\*\* 2 seconds ***EP2:*** 6 seconds

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***EP1:*** Milchick shuts the recorders view screen which would make a sound ***EP2:*** There is no sound of the screen being shut

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick also has a different tone in his voice between the two episodes

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***EP1:*** he sounds emotionless ***EP2:*** Milchick sounds excited.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This may suggest that the E2 recording was made earlier on in the severance timeline

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick also looks younger and more vibrant or possibly just his unsevered self

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It seems like the first part of the recording that we saw in E1 was purposefully left out of this E2 version

**Timestamp 00:44**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick says ‚ÄúSo your work personage will be waking in a few hours on the severed floor‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Personage: ‚ÄúCharacter in a play or other work‚Äù

**Timestamp 1:05**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick tells oHelly that Eagan used to drink three raw eggs in milk each morning

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We see this later as a purposeful act to test for proper severance during the survey

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† However, the way oHelly responds suggests that oHelly is not actually Helena.. or at least not yet?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Perhaps Helena‚Äôs consciousness was put into oHelly‚Äôs body after she was severed

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Perhaps oHelly‚Äôs body eventually contains the consciousness of Helena and iHelly

**Timestamp 1:11**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Imagery of water is shown in the form of a water fountain

**Timestamp 1:13**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oHelly walks with her hands held together in front of her

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This walking posture/gate could be a tell in the future to differentiate between Helly‚Äôs

**Timestamp 1:19**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick types in a 3 digit code for a secure door

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oHelly was able to see whatever code Milchick entered

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This information could prove useful later

**Timestamp 1:37**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† K2-94 Medical mask was created by Bell Labs (irl Severance building)

**Timestamp 1:46**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ketamine HCL 100mg/10ml vials shown x3 with 1 needle

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ketamine can be used as anesthesia

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ketamine can also be used to treat depression and possibly treat alcoholism

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ketamine can induce transient psychosis-like symptoms in healthy individuals and exacerbate symptoms in those with schizophrenia

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I am not an anesthesiologist: It looks like the nurse administers 1.25ml intravenously, apparently this is too low of a dose for this procedure

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Also, it is weird to notice that the ketamine was administered ***after*** oHelly was already cut into with a scalpel

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The tray of ketamine shows no signs of being used previously

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.25ml of 100ml/10mg Ketamine would be a dose of 12.5mg intravenous

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This kind of dose would not be appropriate for anesthesia, but would be used during psychiatric use, in treatment of something like depression

**Timestamp 2:12**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reflections in the doctor‚Äôs glasses don‚Äôt quite show Helly‚Äôs head this time

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Could this mean the doctor is operating on someone or something else in this cut scene?

**Timestamp 2:20**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The drill penetrates the skull

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oHelly‚Äôs eyes seem to flutter irregularly

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This is called ‚ÄòOcular Flutter‚Äô and could be a sign of potential neurological damage or irritation

**Timestamp 2:27**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Severance chip blister pack is shown

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Live to work. Work to Live‚Äù Both are extremes of a spectrum.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This show seems to be all about 2 opposite ends instead of finding balance somewhere in the middle, the separation of blue and red

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúSEV MP 400281 305‚Äù is a reference number to an Intel 4004 microprocessor

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Federico Faggin designed the ***Intel 4004***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Federico Faggin also founded the company ***Synpatics***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Synaptics‚Äô mission is to innovate at the intersection of technology and ***human-like*** cognitive processing

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation is also focused on promoting the understanding of consciousness, both theoretical and experimental

*(I can‚Äôt make out what the writing says underneath the label.. and it ‚Äì is ‚Äì killing me XD)*

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The severance chip itself is red, which I found odd

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It feels like the colour red is seen as negative in this series

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why was the chip red? Lumon‚Äôs colour scheme seems to always be blue

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Intel‚Äôs colour scheme is blue

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Intel‚Äôs biggest competitor is AMD, AMD‚Äôs colour scheme is red

**Timestamp 2:38**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The images on the medical screens seem to be using BrightMatter‚Ñ¢ technology

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúThe selected tool is too short for trajectory‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Seems odd they would use a tool that is too short

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Helly‚Äôs severance chip procedure could have been preformed incorrectly from the very start

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† At first glance, it looks like the targeted location for the chip implantation is on the right side of the brain, however the LP and RA seem to be flipped

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I am no rocket surgeon or brain engineer, but does this mean the chip is actually being inserted on the left side?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***Left side of the brain:*** Language processing, Analytical Thinking, Detail Orientation, Sequential Processing, Control of the Right side motor Functions, Logical Reasoning

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Left side helps individuals make decisions based on rational thought rather than emotional responses

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If the left brain controls the right side motor functions, perhaps writing notes or communicating with your left hand could go un noticed

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I have yet to notice anyone who is left handed so far, still looking

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The time on the screen shows ***2:00pm***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If it is 2pm right after Helly recorded her video, and oHelly is supposed to wake up roughly 2 hours later.. this means it should be 4pm or later when Helly watches her video

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It is roughly 12:35 am? on the wall clock shown as oHelly is watching her video message in S1E1

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This means that it has to have been at least 1 full day before oHelly wakes up on the table for the Survey. I am guessing longer

¬†

Does your head hurt? Mine does DX

**Timestamp 3:02**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The nurse is now injecting the Ketamine, which means the ketamine‚Äôs main purpose was not to sedate before the scalp cutting or the skull drilling

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Doubling back on Ketamine below:**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***Antidepressant:*** leads to changes in brain activity that can alleviate depressive symptoms within hours

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***Dissociative:*** feelings of detachment from one‚Äôs thoughts, surroundings, and identity

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***Neuroplasticity Enhancement:*** the brain‚Äôs capacity to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections

**Timestamp 3:40**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick says ‚ÄúHey, Helly‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It seems like oHelly is still oHelly and not Helena.. at least not always

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Unless.. the outtie is actually an innie and an innie is actually an innie of an innie = innie¬≤

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Severance meets inception?

**Timestamp 3:53**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oHelly asks ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This whole dialogue between Helly and Milchick make me believe that going out the stairwell exit is different than going out the elevator exit

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This can be what the blue sticky note is referring to when it says \*\*\*‚Äú\*\*\****Go home*** ***the long way‚Äù***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Perhaps taking the stairs allows someone to not be fully switched off/on

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The electric sound you hear when she passes through the door could simply be a memory wipe of some kind and not a switching between severed and unsevered

**Timestamp 5:18**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cut scene to Helly arriving on the severed floor in the elevator

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Notice the elevator dings and the two different tones

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Helly was for a time switched back to her outtie and then arriving at the severed floor, the elevator tone let‚Äôs us know she is now iHelly

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Notice iHelly is a bit dizzy and almost feels the need to grab the handrails that Milchick previously mentioned to her

**Timestamp 5:25**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick says ‚ÄúHey old timer, one day down‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We know that they are constantly lying about time to the severed employees, so probably safe to assume that it isn‚Äôt actually 1 day down

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick is offering iHelly a bouquet of white flowers, we saw oHelly walking with these same flowers in S1E1 after work when oMark nearly drives into her

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This is also the same flower arrangement that we can see Mark‚Äôs wife holding in their wedding photo

**Show Intro**

*I wont timestamp these.*

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mike is in bed, in his work clothes; but he is not sleeping.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mike is walking past Red Pajama Mike. Red Mike is holding a balloon assortment of Mikes, similar to the imagery of his blue balloons later

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Blue\* and Red separation imagery again

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Red Mike is walking in the snow, retracing his steps and leaving no steps behind him

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This imagery shows how Mike is going forwards in time while also going backwards in time

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Wall clock showing time moving forwards and backwards. Hours moving forwards and the minutes moving backwards

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A Clear separation of Blue and Red that is reminiscent of the fish tank

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† When Red Mark is shown in the work cubicle surrounded by iMarks, he is missing his Blue key card around his neck (possibly just an edit mistake?)

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Red Mark drops into the ‚Äúsevered‚Äù head of iMark.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This could be imagery that shows oMark is still somewhere inside the mind of iMark and the two are not actually fully severed

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The needle is shown removing the table of marks, with the Red Mark being removed lastly

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The liquid is dark and turns into a black liquid

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The black liquid is attempting to pull Red Mark down

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***Neuromelanin*** is described as a dark black liquid found inside the brain

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Increases in neuromelanin cause neurodegeneration (especially parkinsons)

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I have noticed Mark‚Äôs hands have slight tremors which is a symptom of ***parkinsons***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iMark also has the sniffles throughout the show, which is a sign of parkinsons

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† These tremors could be from Adam Scott the actor, they could be great acting or they could be both at the same time

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Neuromelanin excess can also cause: Cognitive Decline, Mood Disorders, Depression, Sleep disturbances, Daytime sleepiness

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Irving presents with many of these symptoms and the black liquid presents itself most often with him

**Back to the show!**

**Timestamp 7:00**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Senior Refiner Morning Checklist. There are 15 checks

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The checklist would suggest that there is no janitorial staff for MDR which is kind of odd but I suppose staff willing to be severed aren‚Äôt so easy to come by and might not be ‚Äúworth‚Äù a chipping procedure for cleaning staff

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***Questions:***

Who replaces the paper towel in the bathroom or the toilet paper?

Why does the ***soap*** need to be refiled everyday?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iMark is shown to preform the first 5 tasks and then gets distracted

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Inspect office crannies for interdepartmental raiders (unlikely).

**Timestamp 7:11**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I found it odd that all the office supplies and even coffee or vending machine items have clear Lumon labels, but the ***sugar*** is not Lumon sugar apparently

**Timestamp 7:36**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We can see 2 Marks using the floor sweeper as they walk past each other

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This could just be a ‚Äútime lapse‚Äù that lets viewers see a sped up version of the 15 tasks being preformed, BUT why do this for only 1 task?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Could this ‚Äútime lapse‚Äù actually just be a straight up in our face tip of the hand? That there are in fact multiple Mark‚Äôs at play

**Timestamp 7:43**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iMark is dusting a computer screen with his left hand

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It is unusual to preform a task with your left hand if you are right hand dominant

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It only shows iMark in the reflection though

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Could this be a mirror reality iMark?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The next scene shows iMark dusting the books with his right hand

**Timestamp 8:07**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iMark‚Äôs watch is still not ticking

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I wonder if this means that we are still in the past chronologically and time is not yet moving forwards

**Timestamp 8:10**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mark is wiping off the group photo, the reflection of his face is black with no face

**Timestamp 8:44**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iHelly asks iMark ‚ÄúHey, so it‚Äôs tomorrow now?‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iMark responds with ‚ÄúUh yeh. Well, it‚Äôs Monday‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Maybe it‚Äôs not ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù or the ‚Äúnext day‚Äù after EP1

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Time does not appear to be linear in this show

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† To be honest, the time thing is making my head hurt XD

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iMark uses the word ‚Äúspry‚Äù which is generally used when talking about older individuals who maintain a level of agility and vitality that defies their age

**Timestamp 8:50**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Red, Blue and Green supplies, these 3 colours are constantly shown

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I‚Äôm guessing they will introduce employees with ***Red key cards*** in the future

**Timestamp 9:15**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iHelly checks her watch and she says ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs 9:05‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† From the scene before, we can see the iMark‚Äôs watch reads 9:08 as well as the office wall clock

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† By the time iHelly checks her watch, 1 minute has passed on screen

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If a watch read 9:09, I do not think most people would read their watch as 9:05

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***iHelly should have said ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs 9:10‚Äù***, perhaps that just didn‚Äôt roll off the tongue as nicely for the dialogue of the show?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This could be totally arbitrary, as iHelly‚Äôs watch is not necessarily exactly timed up with iMark‚Äôs watch and the Office wall clock

**Timestamp 9:33**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iDylan is talking to iHelly about his current file ‚ÄúTumwater‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iHelly asks ‚ÄúShould I be taking notes‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† iMark says ‚Äúnope‚Äù and ***I‚Äôve decided to take him truly at his word on this XD*** because my brain can‚Äôt handle trying to decipher the number codes on the screen

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I chose to believe the numbers are purely a distraction (for now)

**Timestamp 9:34**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Employee Handbook

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Page 3 ‚Äúwhether it is the oil industry, the ***sugar*** industry, or our industry.‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I suppose this is why the sugar does not have the Lumon logo on it, because Lumon does not deal with oil or sugar

**Timestamp 9:36**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There is clearly a hidden camera at the top of the computer monitor

**Timestamp 10:20**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Helly says ‚ÄúWhat about Mark‚Äôs crystal head cube?‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Crystal.. Crystal Clear.. Clear Head.. Clear Headed?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This is just something they gave Mark

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Could this mean that they gave mark a clear head?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Is iMark completely clear of the hurt of losing his wife?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† And could this ‚Äúclear head‚Äù be taken away in the future?

**Timestamp 11:23**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The numbers at the bottom of the computer screen on the Siena file ‚Äú0x137D58 : 0x09BCB1‚Äù can be tied to Hex Colour codes

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The few codes that are shown in this scene are all shades different of green

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I still think the scattered numbers in the middle of the screen are a distraction!

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I believe Mark here when he tells us that the numbers shouldn‚Äôt mean anything to us

**Timestamp 15:24**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick says the elevators are equipped with ***‚ÄúCode detectors‚Äù*** I believe this to be a lie, like everything he says

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Although.. ‚ÄúCode detectors‚Äù could possibly be in reference to the ***‚ÄúI1000 single-chip optical character recognizer‚Äù***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The ‚ÄúI1000‚Äù was created at Bell Labs and is a specialized integrated circuit designed to perform the task of recognizing and converting printed or handwritten text into machine-readable data.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Milchick says ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs 30 years old, she‚Äôs allergic to almonds and has weak enamel‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I feel like she‚Äôs not 30, I doubt she is allergic to almonds as we see them in the vending machine during the time she was suicidal and she did not capitalize on this

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I do find it interesting that Milchick mentions her enamel, especially with the teeth display in the perpetuity wing

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† She technically is not the 4^(th) tallest person in the office, since Milchick is currently in the office

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Her hair is also technically not shoulder length, it is ‚Äúcollar bone length‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If everything Milchick says is a lie, then she most definitely does not have a family

**Timestamp 19:58**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Staff Bathroom emblems are 2 arrows pointing up and down

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This makes me wonder, ***do we actually know if the severance floor is in the basement?***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Could the elevator actually be going up to reach the severed floor?

**Timestamp 20:51**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Originally iHelly was holding the blue sticky note in her right hand

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Now she is holding the note in her left hand

**Timestamp 21:01**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Helly tries to escape up the elevator with the note and a red light turns on and the elevator shuts down

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A ‚Äúcode detector‚Äù could have been triggered, or simply Milchick alerted the authorities, and they shut the elevator down manually

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I find it odd that the wall clock is blurry and the time is not visible during this scene

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The clocks/watches seem to almost always be very clear whenever they are shown in frame

**Timestamp 28:13**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oMark reaches for Petey‚Äôs Red envelope and Ms. Selvig interrupts him

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oMark is constantly being interrupted by Severance management before he can move forward in his outtie life

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I think it‚Äôs clear that he is under surveillance inside his home

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ms. Selvig offers him chamomile cookies

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chamomile is used to aid in sleep

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† She is always concerned about oMark not sleeping enough

**Timestamp 28:53**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It‚Äôs curious to wonder why oMark felt the need to unplug and perhaps hide his laptop from Ms. Selvig

**Timestamp 29:40**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ms. Selvig talks about how her dead husband would start building a house in the ‚Äúhereafter‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hereafter could be in reference to ‚Äúafter death‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Could this be purgatory? I‚Äôm sure people suffering from depression and lost love due to their spouse dying or children dying must feel like they are in a type of purgatory (waiting period) until they are reunited with their loved ones

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It‚Äôs strange that she said her husband drew blueprints, when that seems to go against the Kier teachings

**Timestamp 31:10**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gemma‚Äôs Crafts Box contains a nutcracker, miniature 35 lights set (Christmas lights) and a red and green candle which looks to be like a Christmas candle

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This leads me to believe that Gemma might have died either on Christmas, or very close to Christmas

**Timestamp 31:22**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oMark is finally sleeping

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Red fish seems to be in frame mostly

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Red Mark looks like he is in pajamas, perhaps Red represents sleep or an unconscious state

**Timestamp 32:31**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mark calls in sick and uses his employee number ‚Äú4502‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Marks employee badge says ‚Äúemployee code: 08-927‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I‚Äôm not 100% sure these two numbers are related

**Timestamp 33:07**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The reflection in the coffee pot

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There is a ***missing metal cannister*** that should be next to the green hand soap when the camera pans out to be able to see the napkin holder, sink, green soap

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dylans blue coffee cup also looks slightly misplaced

**Timestamp 34:26**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Handwriting on the back of the card with ‚Äú499 HALF Loop rd‚Äù is not in Petey‚Äôs handwriting

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The 9‚Äôs are oddly written. The d also looks weird

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Will have to keep a lookout for a character writing their 9‚Äôs like this in the future

**Timelapse 34:44**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Finger traps represent the idea that struggling against pain or difficulties can often make them worse, while accepting and leaning into them can provide a way to escape or find relief.

**Timestamp 35:05**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mark‚Äôs Freshman Fluke

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† According to the extracted audio: ‚Äú.. they were to reverse engineer whatever some new process on whatever he did. Now the average file takes ***six weeks***.‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mark was given his Crystal Head ornament that says ‚ÄúAllentown‚Äù on it

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Intel 4004 Microprocessor was made in Allentown

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúOne notable aspect often discussed about the Intel 4004‚Äôs development is the intense timeline associated with its creation. Specifically, Federico Faggin played a critical role in designing and implementing the chip within an extremely short period‚Äîjust ***six weeks***.‚Äù

**Timestamp 35:06**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† When Irving yawns, suddenly Helly and Dylan‚Äôs voices become echoey and eventually start to go in reverse audio

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This could suggest that when a severed employee loses consciousness, time goes backwards, or reality becomes mirrored somehow

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Hex Color codes at the bottom of Irving‚Äôs screen (FFF588BB, FFFAC4E7) are shades of pink

**Timestamp 36:25**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† oMark walks into the abandoned greenhouse

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† what looks to be ‚ÄúGreenhouse thermal screen reflective shade netting‚Äù is hanging tattered

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Thermal shade netting is made of aluminum

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Could this Aluminum be helping to block out the possible transmitter or signals in the severance chip?

***Timestamp 39:40***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Petey says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been reintegrated for 2 weeks now‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This could mean that we are missing at least a weeks worth of time (this time stuff always hurts my brain)

***Timestamp 41:19***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Petey plays a recording of iMark repeating the Break Room mantra

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Curious to see how Petey smuggled the recording out

***Timestamp 51:01***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Petey receives a phone call on his cell phone

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Directly after the phone starts ringing, Petey develops a nosebleed and pain in his head

***Timestamp 51:40***

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ***Water*** seems to have strange effects on Petey

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Water seems to have forgetful effects on innies on the severed floor

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Water seems to make unsevered people remember things when they are not on the severed floor

1ib8thp,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ib8thp/new_washroom_policy/,New washroom policy,"How have you guys been dealing with the sheer number of people yelling in your face about the new policy?? Cause I'm already over it 
Yesterday I had no less than 10 annoying ass GROWN MEN yelling in my face about not being able to use the bathroom.

1. The authors will assume that consumers have a preference relation on all possible consumption bundles, or a choice function on all subsets of consumption bundles of interest.‚ÄÇThey will proceed by considering either abstract consumers or very simple concrete consumers in the world of one, two or three goods.‚ÄÇBut this has nothing to do with reality.

   - In reality, there are myriads of goods on the market.‚ÄÇFor analysis, these myriads need to be grouped into a manageable number of groups, and it is not clear how to do this on an empirical basis.‚ÄÇFor example, it is plausible that I should first group Assam black tea with Ceylon black tea, then group them both with Oolong and other fancy Chinese teas, and lastly group all kinds of tea with various sorts of coffee and maybe also energetic drinks.‚ÄÇWhat kind of data would let me perform this grouping automatically?
   - It is never explained how I can mathematically define a consumer, either on paper or with a computer.‚ÄÇThere is an infinity of possible consumption bundles.‚ÄÇFrom any set of consumption bundles that plausibly can be on offer, the consumer would choose the set of preferred consumption bundles.‚ÄÇThis is a certain function from the power set of consumption bundles to itself.‚ÄÇHow do I define this function, in principle?‚ÄÇAnd how do I define this function realistically, given some real world data?

2. The authors will assume that there is one price associated to every good.‚ÄÇThis is a very heavy assumption.‚ÄÇThere are many different kinds of money, the same kind of money will have different purchasing power in different locations, and consumers can very well influence prices by their choices.‚ÄÇFor most of the history of mankind, there was no abstract money ‚Äî instead, certain goods were selected as favoured media of exchange thanks to their physical properties.‚ÄÇSurely consumers exist in all these circumstances ‚Äî but I do not see anywhere a definition of consumer that does not rely on the notion of abstract, singular and absolute money.

I sought an answer in _Microeconomic Analysis_ by Hal Varian, chapter 7, and in _Microeconomic Theory_ by Andreu Mas-Colell and allies, chapters 1‚Äì3, but I do not think they say anything that would help me in this inquiry.‚ÄÇThey assume whatever is needed for their mathematical tools to work smoothly ‚Äî and their mathematical tools are nice and well honed, but this is not what I need.‚ÄÇI am fine with an analytically intractable model, so far as it can be computed on my computer.",1,1737983728.0,AskEconomics,3,1.0,False

Anyway. About three years ago my ex-colleague did the small talk dance, as you would, waiting for a meeting to start. I was new to the office and did not know anyone's personalities yet.


She was gushing about her daughters' achievements at school. I was politely nodding along, and gave the appropriate responses. When she said her daughters were voracious readers, I asked her what kind of books they read. It's one of the few things I actually could genuinely talk to parents about,  because I myself love books.


Based on her answer, I suggested a couple of books that her daughters might like (Artemis Fowl and Percy Jackson series). She then asked me whether I had children.


I said no, and won't have any. I braced myself for intrusive follow up questions, but I was wrong.


She went, ""Oh that's okay, nothing wrong at all! You could be their aunty who gives books as birthday and Christmas presents! And because they won't have to compete with your children, they can request for more than one book at a time! They'll be so excited!!!""


I just laughed politely and did not respond to that. I shifted the topic to the upcoming meeting agenda, and thankfully not long after the rest of attendees appeared and we started the meeting.


I declined her coffee invitations, making excuses of being busy (at that time I did have a second job and I was planning for my wedding). I left that job a couple of years later and managed to not become friends.

\- Hotels not giving us the room we originally booked or not telling us that they didn't have a room for us at all due to a mistake, so we were just left waiting around for 4 hours with no information.  
\- Restaurants having items we never ordered on our bill (multiple times)  
\- Ordering an item off the menu and never having it arrive and when we ask how long it will be being told they don't have it available (You didn't think to tell us so that we could order something else!?)  
\- Incorrect change being given after purchase (multiple times)  
\- Cashiers at supermarkets constantly making mistakes and watching customers have to return to get it fixed.  
\- Being allowed to walk into an upstairs dining area even though there was a town meeting going on up there!  
\- Restaurants & kiosks not telling you that 80% of their menu is unavailable so you just have to go through each individual item to ask if they have it. (ice cream kiosks with no ice cream, cafes with no coffee etc.)

1ib8hou,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1ib8hou/does_athome_whitening_really_work/,Does At-Home Whitening Really Work?,"Teeth whitening is one of those things that sounds simple but feels overwhelming once you start looking at all the options. I‚Äôve tried strips, toothpaste, and even DIY remedies (hello, baking soda), but nothing really gave me the bright smile I wanted. Professional treatments seemed too expensive and intimidating, so I decided to try **Laughland teeth whitening** after hearing about its unique combination of a **dentist-formulated gel** and **LED technology**. Here‚Äôs what happened over six days of use.

# Why I Chose Laughland Over Other Options

I‚Äôm someone who drinks coffee and tea daily, so stains have built up over time. My teeth weren‚Äôt super yellow, but they definitely weren‚Äôt as white as I wanted them to be. I knew I needed more than whitening toothpaste, but I wanted something affordable and gentle.

What stood out to me about Laughland was the promise of professional-grade whitening at home, without the pain or sensitivity I‚Äôd experienced with other products like whitening strips. Plus, the six-day routine sounded manageable‚Äînot one of those three-month-long regimens that are hard to stick with.

# What Comes in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

The kit included everything I needed for the whitening process:

1. **Whitening Gel Pens**: These pens make it easy to apply the gel directly to your teeth.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: This light helps activate the whitening gel, making it more effective.
3. **Simple Instructions**: The guide was straightforward and explained each step clearly.

I liked how compact and clean the packaging was. Nothing felt cheap or thrown together‚Äîit was simple, but everything seemed well-made.

# How the Whitening Process Works

The sessions only take 10 minutes a day, which was perfect for me. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

1. **Brush and Dry Your Teeth**: This step ensures the gel can stick properly to your teeth.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Twist the applicator pen and paint the gel evenly across your teeth.
3. **Use the LED Mouthpiece**: Turn on the light, insert the mouthpiece, and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: After the timer goes off, rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

I usually did this while watching TV, and the time flew by.

# My Day-by-Day Results

* **Day 1**: I didn‚Äôt see much difference after the first session, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I noticed my teeth were visibly brighter‚Äîespecially where the coffee stains used to be.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, my teeth were about 6‚Äì7 shades whiter. The results were even and looked natural, not overly bright or fake.

The best part? **No sensitivity at all.** I‚Äôve had bad experiences with whitening strips in the past, but I didn‚Äôt feel any discomfort during or after using Laughland.

# What Makes Laughland Stand Out

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel was made to be effective yet gentle, lifting stains without harming enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation**: The LED mouthpiece helps the gel work faster and penetrate deeper into the enamel.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The gel is stored in a controlled environment to keep its strength, unlike some store-bought options that weaken over time.

**Want to check out the kit for yourself?

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Methods

Here‚Äôs how it compared to the other whitening methods I‚Äôve tried:

* **Whitening Strips**: Caused uneven whitening and left my teeth feeling sensitive.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Great for maintenance but didn‚Äôt remove deeper stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Very effective but expensive and left me with tooth sensitivity for days.

Laughland felt like a great middle ground‚Äîit offered professional-level results at home without the discomfort or high price tag.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

Here are a few questions I had before trying Laughland and what I found out:

1. **Is it safe for enamel?** Yes! The gel is formulated to lift stains without damaging your enamel.
2. **Does it work on older stains?** Yes, I saw improvements even on stains that had been there for years.
3. **How long do the results last?** This depends on your habits, but avoiding staining foods and drinks can help keep your teeth bright for several months.

# Tips for the Best Results

1. **Stick to the Routine**: Use it daily for six days as recommended.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Try to cut back on coffee, tea, and red wine during the whitening process to prevent new stains.
3. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing will help preserve your results.

# Final Thoughts

For me, Laughland teeth whitening was worth it. It‚Äôs easy to use, the sessions don‚Äôt take much time, and I saw noticeable results without the sensitivity I‚Äôve had with other whitening products.

If you‚Äôre looking for a way to brighten your smile at home without spending a fortune, this could be a great fit. While it might not replace professional treatments if you‚Äôre looking for dramatic, instant results, it‚Äôs perfect for those who want a gradual, natural improvement.

Use these science backed grounding technique to Instantly regain control.,"When anxiety strikes, it can feel overwhelming and paralyzing. But here‚Äôs a science-backed technique that can help you regain control in just a few minutes. It‚Äôs called the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding method, and it works by bringing your focus back to the present moment and calming your nervous system.

Here‚Äôs how to do it:

Name 5 things you can see ‚Äì Look around and notice details you may have overlooked (e.g., a pattern on the wall, a piece of furniture, your hands).

Name 4 things you can touch ‚Äì Focus on textures like your clothes, a pen, or even the feeling of your feet on the floor.

Name 3 things you can hear ‚Äì Tune into background noises, like the hum of your computer, birds outside, or distant chatter.

Name 2 things you can smell ‚Äì Take a deep breath and notice any scents in the air (e.g., coffee, fresh air, perfume).

Name 1 thing you can taste ‚Äì Pay attention to what‚Äôs in your mouth, whether it‚Äôs gum, water, or just the aftertaste of your last meal.

Why this works:
This technique engages your senses and activates your brain‚Äôs prefrontal cortex, shifting focus away from anxious thoughts and grounding you in reality. Studies show that engaging with your surroundings reduces stress hormones like cortisol and promotes calmness.

The coffee I've had in it for a couple weeks tastes a bit flat and seems to be missing some florals. Is it from the canister, my imagination, or just how the beans are aging? Who knows. 

I had read some people claim that the vacuum is a good thing because it keeps moisture and oxygen away from the beans. I have also read that the vacuum doesn't make a difference in oxidation because the beans will immediately start to oxidize once you release the vacuum anyways. I have also seen claims that the vacuum is actually harmful, sucking oils to the surface of the beans where they could oxidize, and removing flavors that would have otherwise ""evaporared,"" more slowly. 

I plan on doing a test where I buy a bag and then put a third into the vacuum canister, a third into an airtight container, and a third back into the bag. I would open and close each once a day to simulate regular use, and then compare the flavor after about a month.

The dark circles under my eyes are gone. I haven't slept so well in years. 

The constant feeling of dread that any second my whole life is gonna fall apart? Gone.

The stress induced/failure fueled depression? Gone. 

Always and I mean always being half-present for everything I do because I'm so worried about the stock market? Gone. Fully focused on whatever is happening at the moment. Conversations with my fiance, work, hell even just sitting here drinking coffee. I'm suddenly present in a way I haven't been in years. 

Like seriously you guys...I know. It's tough and you get sucked in and sent down the spiral and if you aren't careful you will really fuck yourself up. Mentally. Financially. Personally. 

Take a break if you're hurting. Please you'll wake up from the stupor and realize maybe the market isn't the most important thing and that alone will change your whole life for the better.

We are all here to improve our lives. Sometimes we push things to far in pursuit of that goal, and end up doing more harm than good.

Anyways, that all I got. Just felt the need to put it out there so maybe someone would see it and realize they are headed down the same path and maybe I can save some poor bastard the stress.

Much love good luck!

I would like you to strap in as this is a long story that has taken place slowly over some years. I will try to make it's as short as possible but still have enough detail to understand my point of view. I am sorry if this is kind of scattered as I put all my thoughts to words.

I thought I had a really good relationship with my husband (over 5 years married). About a year ago I found out that's not the case. 

To kind of get to the point,
After feeling my husband was distracted and more distant than normal (ADHD) I caved into my stupidity and looked through his phone. We have always had an open phone policy as both our last relationships were cheaters. Well I found he was talking sexual to other people, and sadly it has been a majority of our relationship. 

For some context when we first started dating I told him that I was attracted to females as well as men but wasn't looking or interested in a female to be in a relationship with. I know I want a relationship with a man. 

About 4 years into our marriage he brings up an open marriage. I thought I was clear in stating i didn't want one and we had moved on but this conversation was in the back of my head when I went looking through his phone. I found them, an app where he hid these conversation. 

Sadly this hit me harder as it's what happened in my last relationship but this time I had 2 kids already. What also hurt was him doing it during both pregnancies, talking sexual to other people. 

Now here is where we fight alot he thinks talking to others isn't cheating you have to have sex to cheat apparently. I don't see it that way. He doesn't believe emotional cheating is a thing and I do. I feel it is super disrespectful how he talks to people like this but I would never. I also feel if I was do this and he found out he'd be pissed. (More on this later)

I am a stay at home mom right now. I used to work while his mom watched our kids until I started college then we moved further away from her to be closer to his work. We agreed I'd stay home with kids (still under school age) as we didn't and couldn't afford to have childcare and I was going to school anyways. 

So I found these messages about a year ago. We get into a huge fight. I wanted a divorce over it. We argue for days and things are said to me that in hindsight feel manipulative. Either way I made a stupid choice but thought it'd save my marriage and the people pleaser in me would be happy. I was wrong.

I was so worn down at this point I tell him if he is going to talk to her anyways than I better be included too. He is happy he gets what he wants. I try to make it work inviting her over trying to get to know her interests and get close as she is with my husband but I get the feeling she also didn't want to be in an open relationship she wanted my husband to herself. During this time, we were physical with her, but all interactions were promised to be threesomes. I bring up a few times to my husband I feel she wants more with him and I kept getting brushed aside. Finally she comes out and says she wants alone time with my husband both sexual and nonsexual. I say absolutely not. At this point we're trying to make anything work so he says I can start talking to other people like he's been doing.

I met a two people during this time. One I stopped talking to as he was also cheating on his partner and that's a no for me. The other I got along with really good. he was a great friend in that time but I felt wrong as I started to feel it was becoming more than just talking. The whole time my husband said I was fine as i told him everything but it didn't feel right to me, so I broke it off. 

At some point this all get to much for me and I recenter myself in this chaos and decide I need to set boundaries I sit him down with her and we have a conversation  that goes to the effects of me telling my husband and I had agreed that all sexual encounters would be together. She didn't want that, she also expects that I be willing to give but never receive sexual advances. That she want alone time both during sex and not with my husband. I say no it seems she wants my husband alone and not us as a couple. 

My husband and I get into another fight as I tell him to cut her off I'm done with that situation. I dont want an open relationship and if he does than we will be getting a divorce. So now we're back to having a monogamous relationship. I find out during the end of all this that I am pregnant. I was devastated. I didn't want to bring a baby into this specially knowing that they were created during a threesome I hated and can't forget. Knowing that I got pregnant just because he came in me instead of her that time kills me.

So we closed our relationship and I thought we'd get past the hardship ls and have our happy marriage now...... not so much. My husband then lost his job halfway through the year luckily he had a back up second job that he could jump into. We try to get caught back up but a month later our family gets into a car wreck while I'm  34 weeks pregnant. The oncoming car hit passenger headlight which is where I was. Totalled out the only vehicle that we had which was for a whole 3 hours max. ( other driver at fault) Were all physically okay for the most part no harm to baby.

We got that situation mostly sorted. Got a new vehicle that is also a piece of shit (bad luck still running strong).

I at this point i am just fed up. I take care of kids all day everyday with no break like bot even to the store, he's been working off and on but feels that's all he should be doing. No help around house or with kids. I dobhave to say he'll take out trash or swap the laundry. He'll also ask if I am in the middle of doing stuff if there's anything he can do to help but it's like at that point why ask. Also why do I have to tell him what needs to get done. 

This has been another point for me. I do stuff for him that he would never do for me........ I feel I put more in this relationship than him. I feel I could get past all of the chore shit if I was treated better but it feels like I'm don't think all for nothing.

I try to keep the house clean, go to school, keep all appointments, make bill payments, fill out all paperwork that ever appears. I try to even help him by running baths, get him coffee and sometimes breakfast in the morning depending how he feels i try take care of his personal need. If kids are overwhelming i try to give him space. I think the most telling thing is he has actually asked me why I do these things for him as he's wouldn't do it for me.

I am now at the point of I have gone through all of this just to be told I'll never get the same treatment I put out. 

Also one of the things he says bothers me some much. He will tell me all guys are like how he is and that everyone he's talk to says he's not in wrong.

Idk why.This account was at one point but perhaps I can use it again? This is a test to see if I can post, and also some people really liked this story :)]

. 
Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it‚Äôs yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it‚Äôs a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I‚Äôd like and she‚Äôd get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn‚Äôt evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn‚Äôt terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I‚Äôd soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn‚Äôt hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

‚ÄúWhat can I get you?,‚Äù she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn‚Äôt sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

‚ÄúCould I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn‚Äôt speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn‚Äôt place right away. It was oddly‚Ä¶.metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

‚ÄúGood time for a late night meal, huh?‚Äù The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress‚Äôs, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I‚Äôd seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I‚Äôd seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That‚Äôs when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. ‚ÄúSaw yer plates,‚Äù he said, motioning to the window. ‚ÄúOut of state. You‚Äôre new here, aren‚Äôt ya?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeen about six months,‚Äù I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I‚Äôm here every night, and I ain‚Äôt ever seen you.‚Äù He was right. I‚Äôd never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it‚Äôs uncomfortable atmosphere. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gonna stare, son. You‚Äôre out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin‚Äô back black coffee. We don‚Äôt do cream ‚Äòn sugar, you‚Äôll just have to mature a bit.‚Äù

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn‚Äôt there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

‚ÄúSyrup?,‚Äù she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn‚Äôt ordered that. ‚ÄúOh, this is--‚Äù

‚ÄúAll we got,‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúSyrup or not?‚Äù

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House‚Äôs-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he‚Äôd ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. ‚ÄúShut the fuck up dude-- don‚Äôt you see that!?‚Äù

‚ÄúSee what?,‚Äù he mocked. ‚ÄúOh, hush boy.‚Äù His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. ‚ÄúYour mind‚Äôs playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don‚Äôt ya sit awhile and relax some?‚Äù

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

‚ÄúAh, come on!,‚Äù the man teased. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôd be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‚Äòround here! C‚Äômon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

‚ÄúThey say these woods are haunted,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool‚Ä¶‚Äù I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

‚ÄúThe shadows yer seeing, they ain‚Äôt real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain‚Äôt no ghosties. There‚Äôs weird people.‚Äù

No shit. I‚Äôm sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. ‚ÄúYanno, you‚Äôd make a fine lookin‚Äô corpse, Hollywood.‚Äù

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn‚Äôt mean I was from Hollywood. I‚Äôd never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

‚ÄúNot a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you‚Äôre one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that‚Äôs like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?‚Äù

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There‚Äôs a few families in them there woods, families I won‚Äôt ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--‚Äù His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren‚Äôt raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. ‚ÄúThat there‚Äôs one of em,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou sit tight, pretty boy.‚Äù

I had a chance to escape then, as he‚Äôd gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn‚Äôt want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

‚ÄúWell, shoot, Todd I ain‚Äôt seen ya in, shit, how long‚Äôs it been now?‚Äù Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

‚ÄúNot since our Brodie went missin‚Äô,‚Äù Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been ‚Äòbout six months.‚Äù

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. ‚ÄúYou looks a lot like my Brodie,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou wanna be Brodie?‚Äù

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. ‚ÄúNow, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don‚Äôt want him.‚Äù

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd‚Äôs voice warned me not to. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna go out there right now. Mama‚Äôs out, ‚Äòn she‚Äôs in one of her moods. She‚Äôs been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.‚Äù

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. ‚ÄúYou gotta ride it out. Yer family can‚Äôt keep doin‚Äô this.‚Äù His voice dropped to a hush. ‚ÄúOne of these days, someone‚Äôs gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin‚Äô, all these missin‚Äô boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.‚Äù

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn‚Äôt want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt try it!,‚Äù Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, ‚ÄúYou gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?‚Äù She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I‚Äôd stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you‚Äôd see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I‚Äôd seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person‚Äôs flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie‚Äôs flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker‚Äôs dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama‚Äôs in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that‚Äôs not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That‚Äôs how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

‚ÄúCome on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,‚Äù she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

‚ÄúYou'd make a lovely corpse!,‚Äù she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator‚Äôs, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

1ib7yly,https://www.reddit.com/r/LedgersLab/comments/1ib7yly/keurig_kelite_review_can_a_coffee_maker_make_me/,keurig k-elite review - can a coffee maker make me less of a mess?,"I‚Äôve survived on gas station coffee for a decade. Buying this machine felt like adopting a rescue Chihuahua ‚Äì unnecessary, slightly embarrassing, but goddamnit, I deserve nice things.

So, here's my thoughts.

# First thoughts

It's a 12lb plastic rectangle that looks like Steve Jobs‚Äô ghost designed a toaster.

Key observations while unboxing:

The ‚ÄúBrushed Silver‚Äù finish is just code for hides coffee stains better than your ex hides emotions.

The buttons make satisfying clicks ‚Äì dangerous for someone who gets dopamine from office supplies.

It has more settings than my dating app profile.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Heads up:

**BEST PRICE on the Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker here:**

[**https://amzn.to/3Cr3APU**](https://amzn.to/3Cr3APU)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features I like

**Strong brew button.** It's like the coffee equivalent of slapping someone awake. Perfect for when you need to pretend you've slept or power-write a resignation letter at 2am. 

**Iced coffee setting.** Makes coffee that‚Äôs 30% less likely to taste like melted ice cube backwash. Still 100% likely to spill on your white shirt.

**75oz water reservoir.** Lets you avoid human interaction until noon. Also doubles as an emergency eye-wash station (not FDA-approved).

**Removable drip tray**. Finally, a place to store your existential dread (and occasional coffee overflow).

**Descaling alert.** A blinking light that guilts you into regular maintenance. 

# Pros

* Idiot-proof operation (trust me, I've tested this extensively).

* Heats up faster than my apartment in summer.

* That 75oz water tank is basically a small lake.

* Surprisingly quiet (unlike my previous coffee maker which sounded like a metal band warming up).

* The brushed silver finish hides coffee splatter.

# Cons

* The water level window is on the side, which means doing that awkward lean-and-peek move every morning.

* It's needier than my ex about cleaning (descaling reminders pop up like guilt trips from my mother).

# Final thoughts

If you're a coffee purist who spends weekends roasting their own beans while listening to vinyl, this isn't for you. 

But if you're someone who needs reliable coffee with minimal effort and maximum efficiency ‚Äì someone who values convenience over coffee snobbery ‚Äì the K-Elite won't disappoint you too much.

When anxiety hits, it‚Äôs easy to feel trapped in your head.

Here‚Äôs a quick and effective trick to bring yourself back to the present moment:

The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Method:

Five things you can see ‚Äì Look around and name five objects (e.g., your phone, a plant, the sky, your shoes, a cup).

Four things you can touch ‚Äì Feel four things around you (e.g., the texture of your clothes, the surface of a table, your hair, a soft pillow).

Three things you can hear ‚Äì Listen carefully and identify three sounds (e.g., distant traffic, birds chirping, the hum of your computer).

Two things you can smell ‚Äì Breathe in and notice two scents (e.g., fresh air, your soap, a cup of coffee).

One thing you can taste ‚Äì Pay attention to the taste in your mouth (e.g., gum, water, or just the absence of taste).

Why this works:
This technique engages your senses and shifts your focus from anxious thoughts to the present moment. It helps calm your nervous system, slow racing thoughts, and ground you in reality.

Next time anxiety creeps in, give it a try‚Äîyour mind will thank you.

Feel free to post your own tips and tricks, but so far in the driving I've done these are the major ones.

* Before overtaking a truck, check in front of the truck for any hazard it may encounter such as a slow moving pickup overloaded with 5 tonnes of junk etc. The truck will invariably swerve and you don't want to be overtaking it when it does.
* As above when highway driving, there are many blind entrances to the highway that you can't see. Keep your eyes peeled on the left of anything you're overtaking for anything that suddenly pulls out.
* The nicer the car the more stupid you can expect it to behave.
* Don't get complacent, easy to say in any driving, but take breaks on long drives, have a piss, grab a red bull or coffee, and have 100% focus the whole time. Someone is going to do something stupid and you need to be paying attention.
* Really pay attention to looking for traffic lights. On the highways there can be many flashing lights from streetside vendors, the U turn flashy orange lights etc. You can come to a lit intersection and almost disregard it as just another light if you're on cruise mode.
* Seatbelts - I am always yelling at my Thai family to belt up. I won't drive anywhere if they aren't.

While still furious at her for demanding his inheritance he just hasn‚Äôt been able to come to terms with the fact she‚Äôs a toxic human being who should be written off forever.

I decided to approach it from a ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs compare‚Äù angle. My sister is a monster. (Probably one of the reasons Rachel has triggered me so badly.) The difference is that mine is very open and aggressive with her intent to destroy her own life and drag everyone else down with her. So‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou hate my sister right?‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúYour sister is an absolute \*#$\*%\^\*&¬°‚Ñ¢\*¬£¬¢‚àû¬ß\* bitch!‚Äù Right, here is a list of everything you hate about my sister, everything she‚Äôs done to me, my mother and her daughter. I handed him a long dot-point list of all the things my sister has done - and alongside each act which of them constituted criminal behaviour.¬†

At the end I put: CONSEQUENCES OF HER ACTIONS and listed the number of times she‚Äôs been to court, the fines she‚Äôs paid and the amount of time she‚Äôs spent in detention (with my mother and I caring for her daughter). By the end of the list he was bright red and ranging just being reminded of it all.

Then I said ‚ÄúAnd here‚Äôs a two-page list of everything that YOUR sister has done to you and YOUR family‚Äù.

It started with her at the age of 17 stealing her mother‚Äôs car, getting drunk, side-swiping a parked car before passing out behind the wheel and driving into a ditch, then waking up and running away to hide out at a friend's house - while she was pregnant. When the police found the car the next morning they discovered drugs in the glove department. ‚ÄúYou told me this as a story about ‚ÄòFunny things Rachel got up to when she was young‚Äô. But this ISN‚ÄôT funny - your parents must have gone through hell because of this. Getting her into hospital, getting a lawyer trying to keep her out of jail, paying the fines, paying for all the damage. Not funny.‚Äù

Then below that the list was VERY extensive, I paid a lot of time with the points under ‚ÄúChild neglect‚Äù - listing all the abandonment, ""abuse by neglect"", social security fraud, theft of money from the fathers and exploitation of the guardians. I listed the time where she decided it would be great for the kids to spend a year in an ‚Äúalternative lifestyle commune‚Äù - living in a shack way up in the mountains with no electricity or running water. (Again - what was she spending all the money on?) Alongside each I listed the crimes she could have been charged with for every action. The final heading was CONSEQUENCES OF HER ACTIONS: NIL.

‚ÄúBecause you, your family and all her ""friends"" enabled her. She manipulated you into writing it off to her just being ‚Äúa bit kooky‚Äù. You were all compliant, constantly compensating for her, cleaning up the damage she left in her wake. And in terms of her criminal actions to an extent you could even be considered co-conspirators.

I‚Äôm Eric. It‚Äôs late, and I can‚Äôt sleep. Nights like this are exhausting, but not in a way sleep can fix. My mind feels like it‚Äôs running laps in the dark, and the weight of everything just sits there, pressing me down.

Work‚Äôs a grind. I drag myself there every day, pretending to care when I barely have the energy to exist. It‚Äôs not a job I love, not a life I love, really. Between that and being on and off the streets, it feels like I‚Äôm stuck in a loop I can‚Äôt break. No amount of cheap coffee or empty smiles can make it better.

Then, there are the shadows. I don‚Äôt even know how to explain them. They‚Äôre like faint smudges in my peripheral vision, just out of reach but always there. Sometimes, I think it‚Äôs just my mind playing tricks on me. But other times, like tonight, I could swear one moved closer. It‚Äôs standing near the window as I write this. I try not to look at it directly. Last time, I thought it smiled.

Writing helps a little, though. At least it keeps my hands busy. I thought maybe it would quiet my thoughts, but they keep creeping back in. The shadows seem sharper when I focus on them too much.

I‚Äôm going to try to sleep now, Diary. Or at least lie down and pretend.

Before I go, though, something‚Äôs been on my mind: is this a weird way to end a suicide note? Is posting one on Reddit a bad thing ? I wonder what investigators would think. Probably just another lost soul. Another file in the stack. Another statistic.

Goodnight, Diary. Or Goodbye 
-Eric

Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I've been casually reading this sub, and I don't see a lot of comments about how much better the coffee tastes when home-roasted. (But maybe I haven't read enough).

During the past year or so, I have gone through months at a time of not being able to drink coffee bc I don't enjoy the taste anymore. Maybe it was that I had covid a few times --- but my last incident was a couple of years ago. Maybe it's menopause? Idk.

I always LOVED coffee, so I miss not drinking it. And it's not like I drank Maxwell House. I always bought organic beans. But I could only find one roaster online that had beans that were full-bodied and rich enough for my liking AND that I could afford. That roaster is, sadly, extremely unprofessional --- takes 1-2 months to get my coffee and they've mischarged me before. Not dependable.

I recently saw a Sweet Maria's video where the guy showed how to roast using an air fryer/ toaster oven. I have that so I wanted to give it a shot. I ordered some green beans and I'm hoping when I get them that they will bring back my love for coffee because hopefully they will taste better than what I'm able to get now.

If any of these reviews pique your interest, give them a try! Truly a wonderful shop, and I only wish the best for  V!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Awful Waffle** *(fresh maple syrup over buttery toasted waffles, sweet brown sugar notes with a warm, nutty undertone)*: I mostly get maple syrup out of this, but surprisingly, it‚Äôs not painfully sweet! While the syrup dominates, the other notes, such as the butter and the waffle, round it out and gives it a nice, almost creamy-like smoothness. It‚Äôs not terribly rich, yet still decadent. If you want a nice pancake n‚Äô syrup scent this is a great choice! Amazing throw, I get lots of compliments. 3.9/5

**Blueberry Tuffin** *(A Blueberry Lemon poppyseed muffin covered in crystallized sugar with a big ol' pat of butter)*: ALRIGHT YALL. This might be the best blueberry muffin scent I‚Äôve tried, and I own two other scents of it (Blueberries Crave Home, Blueberry Tart (HoG)). BCH is very syrupy and thick, while BT is too‚Ä¶sour? But not this one, oh no. It‚Äôs sweet, the blueberry muffin is just the right balance of bakery and fruity, while remaining buttery and delicious! I get SO MANY people turning their heads wearing this. Please get this one if you‚Äôre a foodie omg, gotta get a backup asap 10/5

**Bubblegunner** *(Classic Bubblegum scent. A tutti frutti blend of artificially fresh fruits on a bed of vanilla sugar)*: yep, that‚Äôs bubblegum. All that‚Äôs missing is the paper wrapper lol. Not much to say, it‚Äôs straightforward and simple. 5/5 for accuracy, but 3/5 for preference.

**Brawlin‚Äô Oats** *(A sweet blend of oats and caramel, with notes of cinnamon and clove dunked into a glass of creamy vanilla almond milk)*: heavily resembles Awful Waffle with spice included. This one is richer, however. I can‚Äôt smell the almond milk at all. This scent is STRONG too, so be lighthanded! I don‚Äôt really prefer this tbh, maybe if the spice was a bit more subdued? 2.5/5

**Cupajoe** *(Freshly brewed coffee with hints of vanilla and cream)*: Straightforwardly coffee and cream. I gotta say, the coffee note is fantastic. It‚Äôs not sour or bitter at all, just a nicely brewed hot cup, lightened ever so slightly with the vanilla and cream. I‚Äôm not a big coffee lover but this is just great, one of the best coffee scents out there. 5/5

**Cupanog** *(Strong coffee spiked with creamy eggnog and a touch of winter spices)*: This is just Cupajoe with spices and extra sweetness. It smells fantastic, but I don‚Äôt reach for this often because of how ‚Äúspicy‚Äù it is; I prefer OG Cupajoe the best. But if Cupanog sounds right up your alley, highly recommend! 4.5/5

**Divine Mintervention** *(Notes of peppermint and vanilla sugar on a base of buttery dark chocolate)*: Straight up mint chocolate. The mint is sweet and present, and the chocolate is dark, smooth and rich. A very simple scent, but great all the same! 3.9/5

**Gummi Bare Knuckle** *(Scented like a true gummy candy, that chewy saccharine fruity aroma you know and love, fortified with authentic Lemon, Lime, and Blood Orange essential oils):* Points for accuracy! This smells like I dunked my head in a bag of gummy bears. It‚Äôs more citrus forward, yet still retains that sweetness you want in a gummy bear. Like Bubblegunner, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. Cute scent! 4/5

**Gimme Chocolate** *(A Hot Fudge with a dollop of Vanilla Sweet Cream):* Ooooh, thick, fudge chocolate brownies. Has a slightly similar opening to Cupajoe. My boyfriend was bouncing between ‚Äòburnt chocolate, chocolate, brownies, cookies,‚Äô a roller coaster of emotions lol. This, to me, reads a dark chocolate brownie. Not bad! 3.5/5

**Moonchild** *(A relaxing blend of Bergamot, Lavender, and Brown sugar. Like a warm cup of sweetened Earl Grey tea):* MOONCHILD MY LOVE. This is the perfect lavender London fog scent for me. Sharp, almost astringent lavender hits immediately, but quickly fades down to reveal smooth, creamy sweetness. It is INTOXICATING. The way the lavender mingles with the sugar‚Ä¶oh my lord!!! If you don‚Äôt mind sharp lavender at all, GET THIS ONE, though I‚Äôm gonna recommend it anyway to others because of how fast the lavender cools down haha. I have a backup since the store will be closing :( 10/5

**Nutrocker** *(Notes of marzipan, vanilla cream, and amaretto on a bed of warm spiced almonds and roasted chestnuts):* Slightly boozy, chewy nougat with strong almond. STRONG. This is a very sweet scent. I love almond scents but this one was way too over the top for me. If you like almonds tho, give this a try! 3/5

**Orange Sore-Bet** *(The bastard child of a Rainbow Sherbet and a Creamsicle. Notes of Mango, Orange, and Lime with a touch of Raspberry on a bed of cool, creamy vanilla):* Hm, this is mostly a citrus scent imo. The vanilla is there, but slightly? The tang of the citrus isn‚Äôt quite tempered enough to let it shine more. I wish I could smell more of the vanilla, but this seems to be the case with almost all the other orange creamsicle scents I‚Äôve had. Oh well. 2.8/5

**Winter Madness** *(Buttery, creamy Eggnog with a kick of Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Clove):* initially it was straight up candle on me, but after letting it rest and testing it out, I can say it‚Äôs nice! Spicy, like pumpkin spice, but the creaminess and sweetness comes through. The spice is quite consistent throughout, just like Cupanog. I won‚Äôt be FS-ing, but I have like 3 bottles of the samples lol. 3.5/5",12,1737980126.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

Looking at creating a healthy alternative coffee brand - think matcha / mushroom coffee! But we cannot think of a name. We don‚Äôt want the name explicitly to do with coffee or matcha etc, so no brew coffee, etc. We love names that have a subtle hinting to the product but not explicit (this could be a subtle nod to the process of herbal ingredients or to how caffeine makes you feel ). A good example is ‚Äòtrip‚Äô drinks which plays in the trip of a drug and it is a CBD drink. 

We would prefer one word brand name. Our brand is around going back to the origins or food and beverage, it‚Äôs not diet culture or calorie counting, it‚Äôs about using clean products that you can easily read on the label, not 100 chemicals in one drink. We want to be clean. We want the brand to hopefully scale into snacks so hence we want a brand name not product. 

We liked Morcha (but we thought its too closely related to matcha), blend, bliss (but a lot of similar products use these words in branding which makes google search competitive), Alula and Moxy (idek these are more desperation calls)

1ib7cr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ib7cr0/snowed_in_with_a_stranger_how_a_city_girl_found/,"Snowed In with a Stranger: How a City Girl Found Passion, Love, and Herself in the Arms of a Rugged Mountain Man","I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be stuck in a mountain lodge with a rugged, infuriatingly sexy stranger. No, I was supposed to be at a swanky business conference, dazzling a room full of executives with my pitch for a multi-million-dollar deal. That‚Äôs the kind of woman I am or was. High heels, power suits, and the kind of confidence that fills boardrooms.

But instead, here I was, stranded in a snowstorm, wearing borrowed flannel pajamas and sipping whiskey by the fire while Ryder, the brooding, broad-shouldered owner of this tiny lodge kept smirking at me like I was some exotic bird he didn‚Äôt quite understand.

Let me back up.

It all started when my work trip took me to this remote mountain town. A quick in-and-out, just to assess whether we could incorporate the area into a new regional project. The lodge was supposed to be a pit stop. But then, the storm rolled in. Flights canceled. Roads closed. The entire mountain blanketed in white. And with no Wi-Fi or cell service, I was effectively cut off from my entire world.

That‚Äôs when I met Ryder. He was chopping wood when I arrived... Of course he was and he didn‚Äôt even look up when I stumbled out of my car, shivering in my designer coat. His beard was flecked with snow, his flannel stretched tight across his chest, and his eyes? Dark, sharp, and annoyingly judgmental.

‚ÄúCity girl,‚Äù he said when he finally looked at me. Not a question, just a statement.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre what, the lumberjack?‚Äù I shot back.

That was the tone we started with: antagonistic. He was all about quiet nights, hard work, and zero frills. I was about espresso shots, spreadsheets, and taking over the world. Oil and water, right?

But the storm didn‚Äôt care about our differences. It trapped us together.

At first, I tried to keep my distance. I holed up in my room, trying to find a signal on my phone, pacing like a caged animal. But every time I saw Ryder, it felt like he was daring me to loosen up. He had this maddening way of smirking at me, like he could see straight through my polished facade.

And the worst part? He was right.

On the second day, I cracked. When I came downstairs in yoga pants and a sweater having finally accepted my stilettos weren‚Äôt making it through the snow, he handed me a cup of coffee and said, ‚ÄúYou look better like this.‚Äù

I almost spilled the coffee. ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean without all the‚Ä¶ armor.‚Äù He gestured vaguely at my face. ‚ÄúYou look real.‚Äù

I hated how much that stung and how much he turned me on.

The tension between us built like the storm outside. Every time he touched my hand, every time our eyes lingered just a little too long, it felt like the air around us got hotter. And Ryder? He was the kind of man who moved like he owned every room he walked into, even if it was just his own kitchen.

By the third night, the storm had slowed, but the fire between us was raging. After dinner, a homemade stew he insisted on teaching me to cook, we sat by the fire. The whiskey bottle was almost empty, and so were our defenses.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different than I thought,‚Äù he said, leaning back in his chair, his voice low and rough.

‚ÄúYeah? What did you think I‚Äôd be?‚Äù I asked, my pulse quickening.

‚ÄúCold. All business. But you‚Äôve got a spark under all that polish.‚Äù

I should‚Äôve been offended, but I wasn‚Äôt. Instead, I leaned forward, letting the firelight dance across my face. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not just some grumpy recluse, are you? There‚Äôs something you‚Äôre running from.‚Äù

His jaw tightened, and for a moment, I thought I‚Äôd pushed too far. But then he stood, walked over to me, and tilted my chin up so I had to look at him. ‚ÄúYou ask too many questions, city girl.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you don‚Äôt answer enough,‚Äù I shot back, breathless.

And then he kissed me.

It wasn‚Äôt gentle. It was raw, hungry, like we‚Äôd both been holding back for too long. His hands tangled in my hair, and I clung to him like he was the only solid thing in my world. He tasted like whiskey and danger, and for once, I didn‚Äôt care about control or consequences.

The night blurred after that, his hands on my skin, my nails raking down his back, the two of us tangled in a mess of blankets and heat. It was everything I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

The next morning, I woke up in his bed, the storm finally clearing outside. But the drama wasn‚Äôt over. My assistant had managed to get through on the lodge‚Äôs landline, reminding me of the massive presentation I‚Äôd missed. And Ryder? He‚Äôd overheard.

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre just going to go back to your perfect city life, huh?‚Äù he asked, his voice tight.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my life,‚Äù I said, wrapping my arms around myself. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you don‚Äôt belong there, either,‚Äù he countered, his eyes burning into mine.

The rest of the day passed in silence as I packed up and waited for the plows. When the time came to leave, Ryder didn‚Äôt say goodbye.

Now, I‚Äôm back in the city, but everything feels‚Ä¶ wrong. The noise, the deadlines, the constant rush, it‚Äôs suffocating. And every time I close my eyes, I see Ryder‚Äôs face. His smirk. His fire.

I‚Äôm thinking of driving back to that lodge this weekend. Because maybe, just maybe, I don‚Äôt need to belong anywhere. Maybe I just need him.",1,1737979943.0,stories,0,1.0,False
