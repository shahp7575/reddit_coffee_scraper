1q6bp42,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1q6bp42/one_anecdote_made_everything_click/,One anecdote made everything click,"I have struggled for so long to understand my parents and contextualize my upbringing. I have been slowly realizing that my parents are not just inept at being parents, they are actively manipulative and controlling. Today, I realized my mother is likely a narcissist.

I was telling my partner a story about my childhood, where I felt unfairly criticized by my mother, and that I wasn’t sure what to make of those incidents. I felt that my mother disliked me, but I felt bad for saying it — maybe I was overstating or being dramatic.

My partner responded: “I don’t think I ever mentioned this before, but one time, we were staying at your parents’ house, and you were having a hard time waking up. You had a migraine. I went upstairs to get you some coffee, and got out a tray. (because my parents want any food that goes out of the kitchen/dining room on a tray.) Your mom asked me what I was doing and I told her that you were feeling sick and struggling to get out of bed, so I was bringing you a cup of coffee downstairs. She rolled her eyes and replied, “Well I wouldn’t be doing all that.”

The fact that this small and fairly low-effort (but incredibly sweet and helpful) act of kindness was met with ridicule by my mother, to my partner, confirmed that my gut feeling about her was right. She has never expressed empathy towards me, and I think she hates me. It’s crazy how everything seems to be falling into place.",1,1767780915.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

We will be travelling to New Zealand from the UK in February (10th-28th) and exploring the South Island with a few stops. We will fly into Auckland and spend a day there before flying to Queenstown and hiring a car. Afterwards, we will travel to Kaikōura, the Matiri / Nelson area, Hokitika, Franz Josef, Wanaka, Te Anau, Lake Tekapo, Christchurch, and then return to Queenstown to fly home. 

There are four of us making the trip and have already booked accommodation for the journey and a few activities at each stopping point along the way. I am now seeking suggestions from people about the best places to visit if you have been to any of these locations. This includes any restaurants and coffee shops you would recommend, any sports events (football, cricket, rugby) that are happening and worth watching, and any hidden gems in terms of sights to see. I am also considering low-budget or free options, as we are travelling for a month, and we want to keep costs manageable. 

For context, my dad is a photographer and would be more interested in finding hidden gems for photography during walks or places to visit on our trip, while I am more keen on discovering really good coffee and pie (I've been told they are top-notch in NZ). We are also eager to watch some sport, so any recommendations would be most welcome.

i was with my ex for seven years married for five. yeah i’m 22 now do the math i grew up fast dont judge. it was stupid romantic at first, that annoying kind of love where everything feels cinematic and your friends hate you a lil. we got married young, had our son, pandemic baby, whole apocalypse aesthetic.

during covid i quit my job to stay home with our kid while he kept working. i supported him through everything. like actually supported. emotionally, financially, spiritually, snacks included. later he started feeling some type of way about being “stuck” and said he didnt want to lose his drive or whatever motivational podcast phrase he was on that week. so he went back to finish business school. i backed him 100%. my mistake but ok.

he graduates, instantly lands a shiny job downtown thanks to his friend (who btw hated me from day one). suddenly he’s making real money and real ego. he tells me i should stay home full time because *he* won’t have time for family anymore. i say fine. love is compromise right.

slowly he turns into someone i don’t recognize. late nights. “networking”. weekend trips that feel very not work related. at home he’s cold, irritated, distant. intimacy dead. i’m apparently “too soft” now. being a mom made me boring. cool.

then one day he sits me down and asks for a divorce like he’s ordering coffee. no shock honestly. i still ask if we can try therapy or even space. he says no. says he met someone else.

turns out it’s some woman at his firm. older. louder. very alpha energy. he literally used that word. alpha. i wish i was joking. apparently she showed him “the life he deserves”. luxury. ambition. brunch.

he tells me she’s twice the woman i am. that i’m too emotional, too dependent. that staying home with our kid made me feminine. yeah. feminine. like sir it was *your idea*. suddenly my years of holding everything together “don’t count”.

he goes on about how she’s confident, powerful, dominant. how she takes him on trips. how she has a real career. and the funniest part she didn’t want to make it official until we were separated. such class. such queen behavior.

i ask about our son. he says i can keep him. says our kid prefers me anyway. that one broke something in me permanently. i snapped, said some things i’d been swallowing for years. he didn’t like that. left.

after that i cried for weeks. not because i loved him but because being abandoned rewires your brain. life felt empty and loud. my kid was the only thing anchoring me. i didnt spiral because he deserved better.

divorce went through fast. online everyone was praising my ex for “choosing himself” and “escaping mediocrity”. i was painted as the sad obstacle wife. nobody checked on me. honestly that silence pushed me into therapy and yeah unfortunately it works. hate that.

fast forward to this week. unknown number. it’s him. sobbing. like full collapse. alpha woman dumped him for someone “higher value”. yes those were his words. she was also his superior at work and now he’s scared to even confront her. poetic.

he explains how insecure he felt after becoming a dad. how the attention at work fed his ego. how his friend convinced him i was holding him back. that he deserved more. apparently i was “safe but limiting”. love that for me.

then he asks if we can try again. says he misses me. the little things. me packing lunches. reminding him about meds. being home. being solid. he says he realized too late.

i told him i missed who i *thought* he was. our son misses him too. but he made his choices. and if things worked out with her he wouldn’t be calling me. i’m not a backup plan.

he cried. said he wanted to come back a week after leaving but was too proud. i said no. hung up.

now my phone is exploding. friends. family. telling me i’m cruel. that he was manipulated. vulnerable. that i should help him heal instead of “abandoning him like he did to me”. that one stung ngl.

his dad wants a sit down this weekend. intervention vibes. wants me to bring our son. just to talk. hear both sides. see if it’s fixable. i’ll go. but my answer isn’t changing.

still. all the noise is getting to me. so yeah. am i the asshole for not taking him back

1q6bild,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanficNovel/comments/1q6bild/leon_and_mira_chaotic_love_story/,Leon and Mira (Chaotic love Story),"Chapter 13: Three Couples, One Guild Hall, Endless Chaos

Fairy Tail’s guild hall was buzzing louder than usual. The air was thick with gossip after Leon had successfully turned the teasing spotlight onto Natsu and Lucy the day before.

But today… the chaos reached new heights.
The doors opened again, and the last person anyone expected stepped through.

“Jellal?” Erza’s voice cut the noise instantly.
The blue-haired mage walked in cautiously, his expression unreadable. For a moment, the guild went still—tension hanging in the air.

And then…
“OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH!” the guild roared.


*Round One: Jellal and Erza

“ERZA’S BOYFRIEND IS HERE!” Cana bellowed, slamming her mug on the counter.
Erza’s face immediately went crimson.

“H-he’s not—!”
Jellal’s eyes widened as if he’d walked into a battlefield unarmed. “Wait, no, it’s not like that—”

“Oh, it’s exactly like that,” Leon cut in smoothly from his seat at the bar, smirking as he raised his glass. “Look at you two. The tension’s thicker than Natsu’s skull.”

“HEY!” Natsu shouted from across the room.
“Not wrong,” Gray muttered, arms crossed.
Jellal coughed, flustered. “I… I came here on business.”
“Business?” Levy teased, scribbling furiously in her notebook. “That what the kids are calling it these days?”

The guild howled.

Even Bickslow’s dolls chanted, “Kiiiissss her! Kiiiissss her!”
Evergreen pushed her glasses up, smirking. “Honestly, it’s about time someone flustered Erza.”

“ERZA SCARLET, FLUSTERED! THIS IS A MAN’S MAN!” Elfman bellowed, tears in his eyes.

Erza’s face went redder than her hair as she slammed her fist onto the table. “ENOUGH!”
The table splintered. The guild roared with laughter.

Jellal just sighed, looking like he regretted every life choice that led him here.


*Round Two: Passing the Torch Again

Lucy, still recovering from yesterday’s spotlight, grinned mischievously. “Well, Erza, at least now they’ll stop teasing me and Natsu.”

“WHAT?!” Natsu nearly fell off his chair. “We’re not a thing!”
“Keep telling yourself that,” Leon said with a smirk.
Lucy buried her face in her hands. “This is never going to end…”


*Mira’s Perspective

At the bar, Mira leaned against the counter, watching the chaos unfold. For once, the teasing wasn’t directed at her. She could breathe. She could enjoy.

Until Cana slid over with a sly grin. “Relieved, huh? Someone else finally under fire?”
Mira’s cheeks warmed. “I-I’m not—”

Cana chuckled. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. We all see it. You like it when Leon stirs the pot. Keeps you on your toes, huh?”

Mira sputtered. “That man is insufferable.”
From a few stools down, Leon lifted his glass without even looking. “Love you too, sunshine.”

Mira smacked the counter. “I DIDN’T SAY THAT!”
The guild roared even harder.


*The Triple Roast

Now the entire guild hall was in full swing.

Leon and Mira: “Married in spirit, divorced in temper.”

Natsu and Lucy: “Childhood sweethearts in denial.”

Jellal and Erza: “Tragic star-crossed lovers, doomed to blush forever.”

Every corner of the hall rang with chants, laughter, and jeers. Bets were placed, mugs were raised, and by the end of it, even Makarov was wiping tears of laughter from his eyes.

“Three pairs!” the old master bellowed. “Fairy Tail’s got more romance than jobs these days!”
“MAKE IT STOP!” Lucy screamed.
“NEVER!” Happy cackled.

Even Erza, the Titania, couldn’t escape—it took her nearly breaking another table to calm everyone down.


*The Aftermath

As the chaos settled into drunken laughter and stories, Leon leaned back in his seat, smug grin plastered on his face.

Mirajane crossed her arms, glaring at him. “You’re awful, you know that?”
He smirked. “Awful? Nah. I just share the suffering. Fair’s fair.”
Her lips twitched despite herself. “…You’re lucky you’re handsome.”

Leon froze for half a second—just long enough for her to smirk back before turning away, cheeks pink.
The guild was too busy laughing at Jellal and Erza to notice.
But Leon noticed. Oh, he definitely noticed.


Chapter 14: Fairy Festival of Chaos

Fairy Tail was many things. Loud. Destructive. Infamous.
But if there was one thing it did better than fighting, it was partying.

Magnolia’s annual Guild Festival Day was in full swing, with the Fairy Tail guild hall transformed into a carnival of food stalls, banners, and competitions. Townsfolk gathered in droves, eager to watch the rowdy guild put on a show.

And inside the guild hall? Absolute chaos.
The Announcement
Makarov, standing on the bar counter with his tiny frame puffed up proudly, raised his staff.

“Ladies and gentlemen, brats of Fairy Tail and guests from Magnolia!” he boomed. “Today’s festival is about joy, unity, and above all—humiliation!”

The guild roared.

Mira, dressed in a cute festival outfit (against her will), smiled sweetly. “Oh, I just love this day!”

Leon, sitting nearby with his jacket slung lazily over his chair, smirked. “What, because it’s the one day you’re legally allowed to bully people?”

“You mean I don’t do that every day?” she shot back.
“Touché,” he chuckled, clinking his glass.


*Contest One: Eating Competition

The first event: a ramen-eating contest.
“GO, GO, GO!” the crowd chanted as Natsu and Gajeel stuffed bowls down like wild animals.

Lucy sat beside them, groaning. “Why do I feel like I’m going to regret this?”
“Because you always do,” Leon called from the crowd, smirking.

Lucy shot him a glare. “Don’t you have a contest to lose to Mira?”
The crowd oohed. Leon grinned.

“Sweetheart, I don’t lose to anyone. Unless she rigs it.”
Mira twirled her hair, smiling angelically. “Oh, I always rig it.”

*Contest Two: Couple Relay Race

Then came the relay race—but with a twist. Pairs had to run three-legged, tied together.

“Pair one: Natsu and Lucy!” 

the announcer boomed.

Lucy screamed. “WHY AM I ALWAYS TIED TO HIM?!”

“Pair two: Erza and Jellal!”

The crowd gasped as Erza froze, red-faced. Jellal looked like he’d rather fight Acnologia.

“Pair three…” 

The announcer grinned wickedly. “

…Mira and Leon!”

The guild exploded.

Mirajane’s smile twitched dangerously. “Who signed us up for this?”
“Happy,” Leon guessed instantly.
“Aye, sir!” Happy laughed from the sky, munching a fish.

Leon smirked as he leaned close while the rope was tied around them. “Relax, sunshine. You get to cling to me guilt-free.”
Mira’s blush could’ve lit fireworks. “I’ll trip you on purpose.”
“Wouldn’t be the first time you swept me off my feet.”

The crowd howled.
The race itself was pure chaos—Natsu and Lucy fell immediately, Jellal tripped over his own cape, and Leon ended up carrying Mira halfway across the finish line like some smug knight.
They didn’t win. But the crowd loved it.


*Contest Three: “Best Couple” Showdown

And then came the final humiliation: the Best Couple Contest, voted on by the townsfolk.

Natsu and Lucy? Denying everything.

Erza and Jellal? Blushing statues.

Mira and Leon? Bickering like cats and dogs.

“Couple number three,” the announcer said, “please give us a demonstration of your chemistry!”

Mira froze. “Chemistry?!”
Leon grinned, stepping forward with zero hesitation. “Gladly.” He slipped an arm around her waist, leaned close enough to make her breath catch, and whispered just loud enough for the crowd:

“Ready to give ’em a show, sweetheart?”
Mira’s face turned crimson. “Y-you—!”
The crowd screamed with laughter and cheers, and the vote ended in their favor.
They were crowned “Best Couple,” to Mira’s utter mortification and Leon’s eternal smugness.

*The Shadow

The night ended with fireworks, drinks, and laughter echoing through Magnolia. For once, the guild was united in pure joy.
But as the last firework faded into smoke, Leon caught sight of a shadow moving just beyond the festival lights.

Something unnatural. Something wrong.
His smile faltered, just for a heartbeat. Then he looked back at Mira laughing with her siblings, and forced it back into place.
The storm was coming.

But tonight… they had earned their laughter.

Chapter 15: The Calm Before the Storm

The morning after the festival, Fairy Tail’s guild hall was quieter than usual. A hangover haze hung in the air as guild members nursed sore heads and full stomachs.

Leon sat at the bar with his usual cup of black coffee, his hair still slightly mussed from last night’s chaos. Mirajane, of course, was already bright and smiling, refilling mugs as though she hadn’t been crowned “Best Couple” with him in front of the entire town.

“You’re awfully chipper,” Leon muttered, squinting at her.

She smirked. “And you’re unusually quiet. Don’t tell me you’re embarrassed about last night.”

He raised an eyebrow, sipping his coffee. “Embarrassed? Sweetheart, I carried you across that finish line like a knight in shining armor. The people loved it.”

Her blush betrayed her. “Y-you’re impossible.”

Before he could quip back, the doors slammed open.

“Urgent news!”

A Rune Knight staggered in, his armor scorched and dented. The guild fell silent.


*The Reports

Makarov hopped down from his seat, staff clacking. “What is it, soldier?”
The Knight bowed, panting. “The western villages… three more destroyed. No survivors. We found claw marks, blood trails, and… bodies twisted beyond recognition.”
The hall tensed. Even Natsu stopped mid-bite.

Leon’s jaw clenched. He already knew what it was. He’d seen it too many times before.

“B.O.W.s,” he muttered under his breath.

Gray frowned. “B.O… what now?”

“Bio-Organic Weapons,” Leon said grimly, loud enough for the hall. “Monsters born from experiments. They don’t just kill—they spread.”

The guild buzzed with uneasy whispers.
Makarov slammed his staff to silence them. “Enough. This threat is unlike anything Fiore has faced before. And we cannot take it lightly.”

*The Briefing

Maps were spread across the main table, markers placed on the western border. Levy analyzed the reports, her brow furrowed.
“These attacks… they’re spreading faster than expected. If this continues, they’ll reach Magnolia within weeks.”

Erza’s fists tightened. “Then we must stop them at the source.”

“Easier said than done,” Leon cut in. “Trust me, these things don’t go down easy. You’ll need firepower, teamwork, and no hesitation. They don’t feel fear. They don’t feel pain. They just… keep coming.”

The room fell heavy with his words.


*The Pairing

Makarov looked around the hall, then let his gaze land on Mirajane.
“Mira,” he said firmly. “Your strength and control will be vital against these creatures.”
Mirajane straightened, nodding.

“And Leon,” Makarov continued, “you’ve faced these things before. You know their weaknesses, their patterns. That makes you the key to this mission.”

Leon exhaled slowly, already expecting what was coming.
“You two will lead the strike team.”

The guild erupted.

“OH COME ON!” Natsu shouted, slamming his fist on the table. “Why do they get to lead?!”

“Because they’re the married couple!” Cana hollered, already raising a mug.

“WE ARE NOT—!” Mira started, red-faced.

“Yet,” Leon added smoothly, smirking at her.
The guild howled, but this time the laughter was uneasy, tinged with nerves.

Because everyone could feel it now.
This wasn’t just another silly mission. This was the beginning of something big.


*The Shift

As the briefing ended, the guild dispersed in smaller groups, preparing gear and double-checking supplies.

Leon lingered by the map table, his eyes tracing the red markers of destroyed villages. His smirk was gone, replaced with the cold, calculating stare of a man who’d lived this nightmare before.

Mira approached quietly, her usual brightness dimmed. “You’ve seen this before, haven’t you?”
Leon didn’t look up. “Too many times.”
“…And it scares you.”

He finally glanced at her, surprised by the softness in her voice. She wasn’t teasing. She wasn’t mocking. She was just… there.
“More than I’d admit out loud,” he said honestly.

She smiled faintly, though her eyes were serious. “Then it’s a good thing you’re not alone this time.”

Leon blinked, caught off guard. For once, he had no smooth reply. Just a quiet nod.
The storm was coming.
And for the first time in years, Leon Kennedy wasn’t facing it alone.


Chapter 16: Sparks Before the Inferno


The sun never seemed so heavy. Clouds pressed low over Magnolia, the air damp and restless, like the city itself was holding its breath. Inside Fairy Tail’s guild hall, however, chaos reigned—not the fun, festival kind, but the desperate, sharpen-your-swords-and-pray kind.

“hey Gray, put on some clothes before the briefing!” Elfman barked, slamming his fist on the table.

Gray looked down, blinking at his bare chest. “…When did I—”

“Not the time!” Erza cut him off, her voice like steel. She was already in armor, blade polished to a shine. “Focus!”

Leon leaned against the bar, arms crossed, watching the circus with a grim sort of amusement. “So this is what pre-mission prep looks like in Fairy Tail, huh? Half strategy, half… strip show.”

“Shut it, Leon,” Gray grumbled.

Mirajane floated past, tray balanced in her hands, still smiling sweetly despite the tension. “Don’t tease them too much, Leon. Not everyone’s as calm as you are.”

Leon raised a brow. “Calm? Doll, I’m sweating bullets inside. I just hide it better.”
She gave him that look—that infuriating, knowing smile—that almost broke his composure. 

Almost.


*The Skirmish

The first scream came from outside the town gates.

The guild bolted into action. Natsu and Happy burst through the doors first, fire blazing around his fists. Lucy, panting, ran after them with her keys in hand.

Leon and Mira exchanged a quick glance before following, the weight of unspoken understanding between them.

At the gates, the scene was already chaos. A cluster of twisted, dog-like creatures—fur matted, limbs unnaturally long—were ripping through wooden carts. Their eyes glowed an unnatural green.

“Damn,” Leon muttered, drawing his handgun in one fluid motion. “Ganados variant. Smaller, but don’t underestimate them.”

Natsu grinned savagely. “Doesn’t matter. Fire Dragon’s—”

“DON’T get close!” Leon barked, stepping forward and firing three clean headshots. The beasts shrieked, twitching violently before collapsing.

The guild froze, startled at how clinical he was.

Leon spun his gun, holstered it, and smirked. “Lesson one, kids: aim for the head.”

Mira stepped forward, her aura shifting, demon energy spilling out as her body shifted into Satan Soul. She looked at Leon, fire in her eyes. “Lesson two: sometimes brute force works just fine.”

She slammed her fist into the ground, releasing a shockwave that flattened the remaining creatures like paper dolls.

The crowd of bystanders cheered—then shrank back as Mira’s demon form lingered longer than usual. Her eyes flickered crimson, her aura heavy and frightening.
Leon placed a steadying hand on her shoulder. “Easy, sweetheart. You’re starting to scare the kids.”

Her form flickered, then softened back to normal. She looked away, embarrassed. “…Sorry.”

Leon just grinned. “Don’t apologize. You looked hot.”

“Leon!” she hissed, cheeks burning, while the guild behind them collectively howled.

“SHUT UP!” both of them barked at the peanut gallery in unison.


*The Unease

Back inside the hall, the laughter faded quickly. Those creatures were just scouts. Everyone knew it.

Levy slammed a stack of books onto the table. “I checked every record I could find. Nothing in Fiore’s history matches these things. If they’re multiplying… we’re in trouble.”

Erza crossed her arms. “Then we prepare for war.”

“War?” Cana echoed, pouring herself another drink. “You mean one of those wars where half of us come back in bandages?”

“No,” Leon said flatly, the sharpness in his voice cutting through the chatter. “One of those wars where half of you might not come back at all.”

The guild fell into uneasy silence. Even Natsu clenched his fists, fire dimmed.
Then, of course, Happy broke the mood.

“Aye! If Lucy doesn’t make it, can I have her rent money?”

“WHAT?!” Lucy shrieked, grabbing him by the tail as the hall exploded into nervous laughter.

It wasn’t much, but it was enough to let them breathe again.


*The Warning

That night, as the guild began its watch shifts, Leon stood outside on the balcony, cigarette smoldering between his fingers. Mira joined him quietly, her silver hair catching the moonlight.

“You ever get tired of pretending you’re not scared?” she asked softly.
He smirked sideways at her. “You ever get tired of pretending you don’t care about me?”

Her face went crimson. “…T-this isn’t about you!”

“Uh-huh.” He exhaled smoke, gaze hardening at the horizon. “Storm’s almost here. I can feel it.”

As if on cue, a howl echoed from the distant woods. Not a normal howl. Low, distorted, almost human.

The kind of sound that made your blood run cold.
Mira’s hand unconsciously brushed against Leon’s arm. He didn’t comment on it—just let it linger.

Because they both knew.

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: November 8, 2136*

 

A slither of light shines through the window at the perfect angle to land on my face… just as it does every time I forget to close the blinds before going to bed. Great… perfect. I groan and lift a paw to cover my eyes. Just perfect, on a day where I could’ve slept in as well… which means I had stayed up far too late last night… Oh sweet Hensol, I feel like I just woke up from death itself… I need a pick-me-up. I struggle to summon up the willpower to leave bed, my joints protesting about as much as my mind as I pull myself out of my room, dreading the thought of expending the brainpower needed to prepare the breakfast I need. Through my mental haze though, I do manage to pick up the sound of movement coming from the kitchen. Turning into the doorway into the kitchen, my ears perk up slightly in surprise when I spot Tibi messing with… are those plant pots? I can smell soil in the air…

“Tibi? What are you doing up so early? Didn’t you want to sleep in after staying out late last night?”

His ears are standing tall, highly alert, all while his tail swings like a metronome in great arcs. I can’t spot even the slightest hint of exhaustion in his features at all. Focusing a little more on what he’s playing around with, I can now notice the box he’s placed open on one of the stools, containing multiple small packets. Considering what else he’s messing with and the smell in the air, I can assume they’re seed packets.  

“Gooood morning dad! Well, I just had a delivery come early, so I got up early too. No way I was going to wait any longer than I had to for it!”

I let out a yawn from my exhaustion, though I do try to cover my mouth out of politeness before falling onto another stool across from him.

“Seeds, eh? Considering what you’ve been telling me about work, can I presume these are from Earth?”

I can hear his foot thumping rapidly for a moment on the floor, answering my question before his voice does.

“Correct! I ordered them recently after talking to Atlas about some of the samples I’ve been dealing with at work, and he even showed interest in ordering some Leirnian fruits! OH! Here, I even managed to get some of this!”

Darting around the table with haste it’s too early in the morning for me to process, he holds up a tiny sprig of some sort of plant up in front of me. I lean back a bit on instinct, though the first whiff shocks me just a smidge more awake than before.

“Woah- that’s uh- that’s strong.”

Returning to his pots, Tibi excitedly shows me a small container of the sprigs.  
  
 “It’s called Rosemary, Atlas mentioned that it’s used often in cooking, so I got some to try it out, alongside some of these- tada\~! Go on, try one!”

Grabbing a bowel he’d place elsewhere on the counter, he slides it over to in front of me. Another smell rises up to meet me, but this time I realise it’s been pervading the room this entire time, it was just blended and obscured by the scent of soil until I confused the two. It’s a rich scent, to the point that I am surprised that its source was just some dark brown beans that appeared to have been roasted. Picking one out of the bowl, I find it to be rather warm still, which means Tibi most likely roasted it himself just now… well, might as well give it a shot. Popping it into my mouth, my eyes fly open the second I crunch down on it, the taste exploding onto my tongue.

“Oh- oh that is *bitter*… but with a little bit of sweetness…”  
  
 “I know right? Atlas recommended them to me, he said that ‘coffee’ was really popular on Earth so I ordered some beans. I tried them raw but they didn’t taste very good. They’re nice partially roasted though!”

After nibbling on a couple more of them over the next few minutes while Tibi continued getting his new seeds situated in their pots, I find myself steadily feeling more energised. Usually I’d take far longer to be even remotely functional when woken up early… but now I feel like I have energy to burn. I glance suspiciously at the beans from Earth, noting to myself to double check what’s in them before deciding if I should get more. Pushing that thought to the side though, I turn my attention back to Tibi.

“So how was the dinner last night? Did your friends enjoy Nopo’s cooking?”

Handling the newly potted seeds with the simultaneous care and ease befitting a professional, he considers his answer for a moment.

“It was a lovely night, and yeah they did all enjoy the food. They got along well with Librin too, which I’m happy about of course. We were just talking pretty much the whole night, it was nice…”

My ear quirks as I pick up on the slight trailing off at the end there, as if he’s not quite finished with that thought, but is hesitating to do so.

“That place does seem to draw out the best conversations. Talk about anything fun?”

He focuses on filling up a cup of water for a moment, but it’s not long before my probing urges him to reveal the completed thought.

“Here and there. Mostly, we were just… finding out a lot of new things about each other. Especially… especially Seloq, a new coworker who just started recently.”

I can feel it as much as I hear it, the hesitation to say more. Treading lightly around the subject… of course it could just be about a private conversation, or it could be something he’s conflicted on. How could I…? Ah, perhaps…

“Ah right, I think you mentioned this ‘Seloq’ the other day. I’m glad you’ve managed to become such fast friends with her.”

Pouring small amounts of water into each of the pots, this time Tibi seems a little more confident as he responds.

“I am too. She clicked with Toripa and I almost instantly, and honestly she knows her stuff really well considering she just started. She’s smart, and really kind and polite… though, it’s clear that she’s always at least a little nervous about something… maybe that ties into her politeness sometimes… if that's the case I’m glad she’s confident enough to join in our banter.”

As he speaks, I begin to calm down slightly. Always nervous, eh? I think I’m starting to see one of the reasons why they clicked so well so quickly.

“Starting a new job is nerve-wracking, I imagine doubly so right out of uni. I assume from how close your guys are already, you’ve been supporting her at work?”

Following a small chuckle of embarrassment, Tibi finally turns away from his pots, seemingly having finished with them.

“The uni element may be part of it but… there’s more I won’t say. I… know what it’s like, to an extent. We’ve experienced different things; there’s stuff she’s dealing with every day. I just… hope I can help remind her that she’s not alone.”

Getting up from the stool with a slight groan of effort, I walk around the table and pull him in for a hug, even as he holds his paws in the air to avoid getting any soil in my fur. The spark of pride in my chest didn’t give a skrit’s ass about the soil.

“You’re a good friend, and I’m sure you being there for her is helping immensely with whatever that problem may be. We all have our troubles… especially in this day and age.”

“Th-thanks, dad… I hope you’re right.”

As I break the hug and Tibi goes to wash the soil from his paws, my ears perk up as an idea strikes.

“You know, it’s been a while since I’ve seen Toripa anyway… how about inviting them over for lunch or dinner sometime, I’d love to see the little rascal again, and meet Seloq.”

His ears perk up as well, all while his tail picks up speed.

“That’s a great idea dad! Just like night Toripa *was* teasing me about having no proof that I could cook… oh! I could even call Atlas too, Toripa would love to chat with him again, and Seloq would get to meet him!”

With those beans giving me more than enough energy, my stomach compels me to get started on breakfast. Perhaps something light this morning though, just some diced fruits.

“That reminds me, I should call Claire after breakfast… oh, though remember if you’re going to introduce Atlas to Seloq, make sure she’s ok with Humans first? Most people are around here, but you never know.”

“Of course of course, she already mentioned being fine with them last night. I’ll still run the idea past her today at work though, just to be sure.”

Picking some fruit out of the fridge, I glance at Tibi again to see him staring at his new pots, a tiny bit of pride in his own tail sways.

“That is a good sign then. That should be a pleasant surprise for her at work today.”

“I sure hope so… oh! On the topic of work, how was yesterday? Sorry I completely blanked on asking sooner, too focused on my seeds…”

I chuckle merrily as Tibi rubs his neck bashfully.

“Don’t be ashamed about getting excited for plants, it’s not like it’s the main focus of your field of study or anything haha! Anyway, work was mostly fine as usual… had to clean up Tilfish vomit at one point though.”

He shudders slightly, turning away from me while I place the fruits on a cutting board and grab a knife.

“Bleh… Do not envy you for that. Anything good happen to offset it?”

As I start dicing the ashfruit, I mentally run through my shift to think of something interesting, before ultimately falling on my conversation with Lewyn.

“Well, I spoke with one of the sapientology teachers. She was getting ready for some presentations about homeworlds her class had in the following period, and was a little worried about Earth coming up.”

Tibi sighs as he collapses onto a stool.

“Let me guess, she thought it was ‘a concerning sign’ if anyone chose Earth?”

I flick my ear in a negative, tossing him the first slice of the ashfruit as I answer.

“Actually, she was more concerned that all the fearmongering about Earth would mean that her students would have a harder time sorting through misinformation. I mean, she mentioned overhearing one joey claim that plants of Earth hunt. Ha! Could you ima-”

I am cut off by the sound of coughing as Tibi chokes on the piece of fruit, having completely frozen as I spoke. I move around the table and pat him on the back as he coughs up the stuck piece, unable to stop myself from chuckling a little.

“Yep, reasonable response.”

While I was expecting the choking to have been from shocked laughter, what I see instead is much… stranger. He does end up chuckling, but it is a nervous kind of laughter, his fur slightly frazzled.

“Haha, y-yeah! Carnivorous plants, what- what a stupid idea! Haha, just ridiculous!”

After that, he becomes… very focused on the next piece of firefruit he picks up, almost as if avoiding my gaze… I hear a soft thumping sound from down below, and look to see his leg bouncing slightly. My ears don’t quite know what to do; drooping a bit at first, before splaying and perking up in quick succession.

“…Tibi…?”

The bouncing leg stops with a thump. I am avoiding mentally jumping to conclusions, but the way he reacted makes that *very* difficult. At last, he sighs once more, some of the tension leaking out of his body.

“…Promise not to tell anyone?”

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: November 8, 2136*

 

Even just as leftovers from yesterday’s breakfast, the isabaar still tastes delicious… though, I can’t quite focus on it enough to fully enjoy it. Part of the issue is that every spoonful just makes my mind drift back to last night, and that incredible soup that Tibi had suggested for me. The other aspect siphoning my focus is sitting across from me. A second day in a row that he’s stayed home for breakfast rather than going into work as per usual. It’s sweet, of course, and it feels nice to not be alone for a meal for a change… though, this shared meal lacks some of last night’s warmth, even after being reheated. The fact that my father stopped actually eating about a minute ago, now just idling stirring his food instead, does little to help. Soon though, he clears his throat.

“So! How was last night?”

He had already tried checking in regarding my night out when I first arrived home, though I managed to sneak off with the excuse of being too tired and just wanting to collapse in bed. The best part about it is I didn’t even have to bend the truth; I really was just *that* exhausted. It was no doubt mainly due to how late Tibi, Toripa and I had stayed in the diner chatting even after finishing our meal. Librin had been kind enough to let us stay for as long as we wanted even after we’d finished both dinner and dessert, which I suppose is a bonus for Tibi and her being essentially siblings… Even so, I knew that a fragment of that exhaustion also came from the *events* of the night. I am thankful for the talk I managed to have with my new friends, but I can’t pretend like it didn’t get stressful or tense at times, especially when my time as a Junior Exterminator came up. Despite that stress though, I’d go back to Nopo’s Feast with them both in a heartbeat.

“It was incredible, truly. The food was amazing, but of course most importantly my coworkers gave me the best welcome they could. My coworkers are sweet, I’m lucky to work with them.”

Keep the details regarding the ‘work party’ vague… Don’t mention anyone by species or *especially* by name. I’m not giving his ‘opinions’ any ammo… not that they need them, I guess. I can try to give him enough information to be satisfied, at least. To my relief, his ears perk up in pleasant surprise as I put effort in to convey my own contentment through my voice and body language.

 “Ah, that is good to hear. I am relieved to hear that the party went well… and that you have uh- *good* coworkers? What are they like? Any causing you trouble?”

Despite his relief, my tail twitches slightly from hearing the scepticism in his voice. It really is that hard for him to believe that ‘good*’* is the right word, isn’t it? My mind once more briefly flashes to the… less than kind welcomes from a couple people in the facility, though he *certainly* doesn’t need to know about them, especially when I have Tibi, Toripa, and Vata to offset them.

“No dad, no trouble from them. Like I said, they’re *good* people. A few have even been focused on helping me get accustomed to the new job. They’ve taught me a lot already, and I’m eager to see them again.”

Maybe if I pile on the praise for them- *emphasise* that I’ve learnt from them, maybe he could… It’s not going to change his mind regarding anything, but it might at least stop him from implying anything less than savoury directly about my friends.

“I see, that is rather… interesting. The fact that you’ve already learnt things from them, I mean. Of course the most important thing is that you’re happy working there, and that they recognise they’ve onboarded such a shining ember, ready to blaze bright!”

Into the compliments he goes. That’s good, it means that he’s satisfied with the information he’s given. Even though I start to tune out his following ramblings, focusing on eating again, I do keep an ear on him as his cautious awkwardness is replaced by excitement. 

“And I’m glad you don’t have any trouble with your coworkers, that’ll make today go much smoother.”

I pause midbite. Both ears and eyes pin directly to him, finding his tail swaying happily.

“…What?”

“Surprise! A couple others and I are going to drop by your work today. I was thinking of mentioning it yesterday but since you’re an employee there I couldn’t exactly tell you of a surprise inspection before the day of.”

A frigid chill races up my spine, my jaw going slack. In his excitement he must confuse my horror for jovial shock, even as my ears pin down.

“…W-what?!”

“Well what kind of father would I be if I didn’t look into your new place of work, eh? I saw they recently received a shipment of samples from Earth, so I figured I could solve two issues at once. Officially I’m just doing a small inspection to make sure they’re being handled and contained correctly. You can never be too careful with anything coming from a predator’s world, even the plants… and honestly you expect me to trust those primitives to resist munching on them?”

He stands up from the table, grabbing both of our bowls to the sink with a happy trill despite neither being finished.

“More *importantly* though, I get to visit you at work! I know you already said that they’re treating you well over there and of course I trust you completely, it just helps to give some… *assurance* of my own, you know?”

I remain seated at the table, unsure if I’m even breathing still. A thousand questions and expletives race through my mind in tandem, though one thought cuts through the rest. Still fresh from my conversation last night with Tibi… a wound that threatens to reopen. With that as my driver, one question charges past the rest to slip out. Maybe Vata can warn him?

He chuckles, a humoured sway in his tail.

“Of course not, it wouldn’t be a surprise inspection otherwise. Technically you aren’t supposed to know either until we arrive buuuuut… well, you didn’t hear it from me hahaha.”

Just as a new wave of panic rises, a sharp alarm comes from my father’s holopad.

“Speaking of- look at the time! Don’t worry I’ll drive you, we’ll get there together just on time.”

1q6b9lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/systemictendinitis/comments/1q6b9lt/fragile_tendons_and_ligaments/,Fragile tendons and ligaments,"Hello,

For the past ten/twelve years (I am 36), I often have tendonitis (knees, elbows, wrists, etc.) that is difficult to heal and/or keeps coming back.

I'm not in pain all the time, but when I make some activity (walking, carry my child a few minutes) and the days/hours after it.

I have had a lot of physical therapy each time, and I incorporate several exercises into my strength training routine.

I am quite thin, weighing 54 kg and measuring 1.68 m, so I don't have large muscles or excess weight.

I have a job that requires me to sit in front of a computer, but I try to move around regularly.

I exercise regularly (cycling and table tennis at the moment). I had to stop jogging because of tendonitis in my knees and tennis because of a thickened ligament following a sprained finger (which hasn't healed in two years).

And recently, I've had inflammation in a shoulder joint following push-ups and swimming...

I'm slightly hypermobile, but nothing pathological.



I've explored several avenues but nothing very useful so far; doctors seem either helpless or uninterested.

Physical therapist -> strengthening exercises, but that's what I've been doing for years.

Osteopath -> nothing in particular.

Nutrition -> I've always had a good diet, nothing too inflammatory (alcohol once a week max, no coffee, no tobacco, no soda, fruit/vegetables with every meal, no red meat).

Good hydration. I have tried several dietary supplements over the years.

Rheumatologist -> not interested “you have weak tendons, that's just bad luck”

Dentist -> nothing to report

Ophthalmologist -> I now wear glasses, but no change

Podiatrist -> I wore insoles for a few years, no change

Blood test -> nothing to report in the range of what have been tested

Nothing special on imaging (except for my sprained finger).



Inflammation could explain a lot of things (including other mild symptoms), but no causes have been identified (or maybe a little chronic stress?) and my CRP is OK.

I'm also quite sensitive to cold (maybe more and more), especially when I try to fall asleep.

I regularly have digestive problems.



It's still “minor” compared to many other conditions, but it still hinders me in my daily life (increasingly limited choice of sports), pain or tendonitis that flares up when I carry heavy loads (children, vacation bags, etc.).

I read the posts about EDS (but I have a very small score to the Beighton test), AS, Arthritis.

I read about mitochondria issues and it look like very hard to cure (and how to diagnose it?)

I can't remember exactly but I don't think I had some medications that could have cause that.

I took one shot of Amoxicillin in 2015 because I was bitten by a tick, but it was properly removed and there was no redness.

I got the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, polio vaccine in 2019.

It started before the covid and vaccine.

Except the knee tendonitis (that started in 2015, and maybe it's not related to the others), the other tendon pain started in 2019 and after.

But my digestive problems started a long time ago.



I don't know which doctor could help me. I don't know if I could make some diagnosis by myself, to eliminate some avenues.

Could it all be related to low/medium chronic stress ?

I don't know if it's good or bad to continue strengthening exercices.

1q6b8sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1q6b8sn/true_philippine_ghost_story/,True Philippine Ghost Story,"This story was my mom's. She passed away in 2021 but this is the creepiest story she told us.

It was around late 1990s when my mom became friends with a neighbor that owns a small grocery store in our town. Not sure how my mom became close with her but based on what I knew, the husband of the owner (who was a police officer) cheated on her and they're having a rough time. My mom comforted this lady a lot to the point that they were bestfriends.

Unfortunately, my family had to move to a different city and since this was the late 1990s, there were no social media yet, my mom and her bestfriend lost touch with each other.

A couple of months went by and it was shown on the local news that the grocery owner took her husband's life by sh**ting him while he is sleeping and then sh*t herself too.

One night, my father wasn't home and my siblings and I were sleeping with mom. My mom had a dream and in her dream she was walking home with the grocery owner in a long dark road. In her dream my mom asked her: Why are you walking this way? You live the other way.

Her friend replied: I'm de*d, I'm just looking for you.

My mom ran away as fast as she could and when she reached our house in the dream, she woke up.

Now this is an important detail: The floor on the second floor of the house is made of bamboo strips and between the gaps of the bamboo strip, you can see the floor below. A house like this was common back in the 90s to lessen heat inside the house as we live in a tropical country.

Relieved that it was only a dream, she stood up and was thinking of going to the bathroom downstairs when she saw someone below, between the gaps of the bamboo floor. It was looking up to her, like it wants to know that ghost was downstairs, like it followed her.

My mom was so afraid that instead of going to the ground floor, she pissed in a cup of coffee instead. Funny af but true.

----------

A couple of years after that, a family who apparently doesn't believe in ghosts moved to the house of the grocery store owner and the police. The neighbors told them that a crime was committed in that house but they didn't care, they were mormons, I believe. One afternoon, the kid of the people who moved in that house was watching anime in the living room when the kid heard someone clearing his throat in the bedroom. When the kid looked at the bedroom he saw a guy sitting on the bed asking him: What are you doing in our house? The family moved out in just a week.

---------

Years after, a tricycle driver (a tricycle is like a Toktok in Thailand, like a mini taxi) happened to pass by the house of the grocery store owner around 3am. According to the driver, he saw a woman waving her hand, calling his attention like it needs a ride. He decided to go back because he thought that the lady is a passenger. The lady vanished like a smoke when he was finally near her and this scared the sh*t out if the tricycle driver. He only learned of the story of the house in the morning when he told the neighbors what he saw.

Until now no one lived in that house.",1,1767779226.0,Ghoststories,1,1.0,False

Big group (about 20 people) I was actually excited because I like cooking and I thought it would be fun

Here’s the problem. There’s this “family tradition” where the newest wife has to host her first big holiday. Fine whatever. But apparently you also have to use this ancient china set that’s been passed down and you’re supposed to do the entire meal completely alone. No help. It’s treated like some kind of test or “rite of passage”

My sister in-law Jessica (35F) did it last year and never stops talking about how she was 8 months pregnant and still did everything herself.

So thanksgivings morning she shows up at my house around 9am with this huge box of china and plops it on my counter. I’m already dealing with the turkey and she goes “the rules are simple. You use the china for everything, and you do it alone. No Mark, no kids, no one. It’s about respect”

I tried to be polite and said the china was really pretty but it’s super old and we have gravy, cranberry sauce, and a bunch of little kids running around and maybe we could just use it for dessert

She looks at me like I insulted her dead ancestors. and goes, “thats not how it’s done. You break tradition, you break respect. My grandmother watched me scrub every dish by hand at 2am. It’s a rite of passage.”

At some point my husband Mark comes in for coffee and she literally shoos him out of the kitchen. “No husbands in the war zone!” He looks confused, I just kind of shrug, and he leaves.

A couple hours later I’m sweating, the yams are boiling over, I’m making pies, and  Jessica is sitting at my island drinking my wine and correcting how I’m polishing the silver. At one point she says, “It’s the grand baroque pattern, not that modern stuff.”

Mark tries to check on me again and she waves a spoon at him like he’s a stray cat.

That’s when I snapped pretty bad

I walked over to my hutch, grabbed my own good plate set (the one my grandma gave me),carried the whole box upstairs, and locked it in the closet.

I came back down and she just stared at me and asked what I was doing.

I told her, as calmly as I could, “This tradition is bullshit. It’s not a test, it’s hazing. This is my house and youre a guest. You’ll eat off the plates I choose and say thank you for the food. If Grandma Betty’s ghost has an issue, she can come talk to me herself. You can go watch the game or you can leave.”

Mark (my husband) walked back in, heard everything, put his arm around me and said, “shes right. It’s a stupid rule and it’s her kitchen”

now as you can imagine, Jessica stormed off to the living room. Dinner was awkward, but Mark and his dad helped me clean up and his brother later said, “Thank God someone finally said it”

Now the family group chat is exploding. Jessica posted a long rant about “disrespecting legacy.” Some aunts are mad. My mother in law privately texted me that she always hated the tradition and that the china is basically mine now. My father in law just asked if there was more pie 

I will admit I was petty and later used the family china to put water out for the dog

Why ghost after getting the money when you have already done everything?,"I’m posting this as a warning to others and to vent a bit of frustration regarding a video editor I hired through Reddit.

**The User:** u/S3REAMY (Avoid him).

**The Timeline:**

1. **The ""Trust"" Talk:** We initially had a phone conversation where we specifically discussed ""trust and work ethics."" He assured me he was professional, and I wanted to start the relationship on a good note.
2. **The Advance:** I sent him the raw footage. He immediately asked for an advance without showing any work. I refused initially, but once he sent a short clip, I paid the advance as promised.
3. **The Pressure:** A day later, he demanded the **full remaining amount** without showing me the final sequence.
4. **The Mistake:** I asked for a watermarked version so he would feel secure while I reviewed the work. He insisted on payment. Even though I was disappointed with the initial edit quality, I decided I didn't want to be ""one of those clients"" who tortures freelancers for money. I wanted to be a good client. **I transferred the full remaining amount.**
5. **The Ghosting:** I went on a family vacation over Christmas/New Year right after paying. When I returned and asked for the final render (which I had already paid for), and all I asked was same edit that he showed me without watermark. he didn't reply. First he blocked me on WhatsApp and when I tried to call him he blocked my phone number. Yesterday I commented on some post where he asked for work, to make others aware of his ethics. And now he has blocked me from reddit as well 

**The Absurdity :** The total amount he scammed me for? **₹600 (approx $7 USD).**

This is what I genuinely don't understand about the mindset of some people in the Indian freelance market.

Judging by his Instagram and WhatsApp updates, this guy lives in Mumbai (an expensive city), uses an iPhone, and posts gym photos. He projects a lifestyle of someone doing well.

**Why scam for ₹600?** Why ruin your reputation and block a client for the price of a couple of coffees? Why is there such a refusal to just *do the work*? It would have taken him a few minutes to provide a non watermarked video and finish the job and earn the money honestly, potentially leading to long-term work.

First interaction happened when we were in line at the office cafe - very brief one - and I got her number entirely by luck after I had to reach out to someone from her team about a specific project.

We bonded very quickly after finding out that we were both cat lovers. We have been texting every day for 2 months, often for hours, but I'm still ""intimidated"" to talk to her in real life. I am prone to overthinking and trying to plan out interactions, so I keep thinking about what I will say and how to approach her and end up getting too overwhelmed to do anything.

Our teams sit quite close to each other so we can see each other but I keep psyching myself out of going over to chat. She also doesn't come over, but she smiles and waves if we make eye contact. She also texts me sometimes when we are both working and has made remarks to indicate that she is at least noticing me, such as asking if I got a haircut recently.

To be very clear I don't think it's on her to make first contact - I am very frustrated at myself for being too paralyzed to act normal in real life. I recognize that the texting only thing is a barrier to us actually getting closer and I need to get over this to have a chance at a proper friendship let alone a relationship.

I also worry that I am reading the vibe wrong - that I think she might be interested in more when she is just being friendly - because of a recent incident when I texted her asking if she'd like to grab coffee after work, she said she would ""think about it"" but never got back to me. We have texting like normal ever since. Was that her way of subtly saying no?

I have only ever been in one relationship where the girl asked me out first so I don't know how to go about this. I am also shy and quiet even though I have been forced to learn to present as more outgoing due to work.

I'm looking to build a twee little romantic roleplay that initially begins with a strong focus on romantic tension and flirtation, before our characters eventually dive into their desires.

Our story would be set in Pumpkinshire - a cosy little town in the south of Scotland, where every street has a family owned bookshop, and the roads are swamped in piles of crumpled brown leaves.

As for our characters? Well - that's up to us to build together! I find that all writers have a specific type of character that they like to play, and I want to hear yours. Personally, I like to play a sort of shy, bookish nerd who has recently had their confidence knocked by some kind of traumatic event - usually a bad breakup. I love plots in which my character has their self-confidence reignited by a woman who makes them feel loved and desired. But that's just one type of character I like to play!

Oh, but you want \*some\* suggestions for who to play, do you? Just something to get the ball rolling? Well, let's see...

Are you a professor in the local university, fed up of the empty, uncultured minds that litter your lecture halls all day, longing to meet someone who truly shares your unending passion for literature?

Or maybe you're a Hollywood A-Lister who has grown weary of the Beverly Hills lifestyle, retiring to Pumpkinshire for a slice of normality...

But hold on... could you be Pumpkinshire's dark secret? The long rumoured demon that resides in that dark alleyway behind the coffee beans shop, finally taking your form as a beautiful seductress, looking for an innocent soul to corrupt and take to your lair?

I'm also open to integrating characters from Marvel or DC worlds!

As for me, little old me? Well, at this time of my life, my gender is rather nebulous to me. I have exclusively played women opposite women when I began RPing around 5 or 6 years ago, however I've recently fallen in love with playing futanari women - though it should be noted that I am **not** interested in playing opposite male characters - sorry boys!

If you're craving the same romantic/smutty escape that I am - please reach out!

I look forward to opening those orange envelopes...",1,1767778559.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

I’ve noticed that when I finish a long call shift, the adrenaline dump hits me the second I walk out of the hospital. I’m fine while I’m working, but the moment I sit in my car and I feel that heavy brain fog setting in.



It’s not that I'm unsafe, but I definitely feel my alertness drop significantly compared to driving to work in the morning. It takes 30min + for me to get home, and I want to make sure I stay sharp, especially for the highway portion of my drive. I have tried drinking coffee, but it would hinder my sleep.

“Step back, ma’am. This is the private villa of the Hart heiress. No unauthorized visitors beyond this point!” 

I studied the young man–new, undoubtedly hired while I was away these years. His ignorance was almost understandable. 

So I forced patience into my voice. 

“Get the estate manager. Henry Cole. He knows who I am.” 

The guard sneered. “Yeah, sure you are. You think you’re Miss Hart? Cute.” 

I smiled a dry, quiet curve of my lips that wasn’t amusement but warning. Arguing felt beneath me. I turned to walk up the drive. 

He shoved me to the ground, keeping me pinned, his knee digging into my back as he started shouting. 

“You just stepped on private property and bought yourself a lawsuit. That’ll cost you five hundred grand, lady. And you just tripped the rich–girl fee and the broke–my–patience fee. That’s eight hundred grand! The patch of imported turf you just killed? Congratulations, two million.” 

A disbelieving laugh was startled out of me. Whoever had been doing the hiring these past few years had no sense of dignity left. 

“Get whoever’s in charge to come talk to me.” 

He had no intention of listening. 

“Didn’t think a knock–off could pass for the real thing. Miss Vanessa Hart said I run this place now, so take your act somewhere else.” 

I thumbed a message to the Hart Group chat on my phone. 

“Tell Vanessa: love the new security team. Shame they can’t tell a Hart from a tourist. Fix it–or fix your own exit.”

His weight was a cage, knee digging deeper into my spine. His voice dripped contempt and fury, clearly treating me like some intruder. 

I forced down the rage clawing its way up my throat and kept my voice even. 

“This is my home. The Vanessa you’re talking about is my younger sister. If you don’t believe me, I’ll call her right now.” 

I pulled out my phone and dialed her number. Busy signal. 

Once. Twice. Ten times. Each time *a* calm, synthetic voice kept telling me the same thing. 

A knot of panic tightened in my chest, but I smothered it. I still wanted to clear this up, so I looked up, my expression earnestness and fraying hope. 

“Her line’s busy, but I’m telling the truth. If you don’t believe me, check the Hart Group’s corporate leadership page. You’ll see. My name is Evelyn Hart.” 

Patience, I thought, would buy me civility. Instead, it bought me laughter. 

It erupted from him–a harsh, barking sound that tore through the manicured silence of the 

estate. 

“Evelyn Hart? Yeah, I’ve heard that name. But your version? Not even close. Word is, some gold–digging slut tried to drug Mr. Hart back in the day–got herself knocked up, thought she could blackmail him for half the company. He threw her out on her ass. The bastard kid she had? They say her name was Evelyn.” 

Hearing that garbage, my brows knotted tight. 

My mom was my dad’s legal wife–married, public, proud. She died in a car crash ten years ago. 

And I’d always been the Hart heiress, the name itself a shield. I left home at eighteen, six years overseas, two degrees, no breaks. So when did they rewrote me as the bastard they cast out like 

a stain? 

He leaned in, his breath a mix of stale smoke and cheap coffee. A greasy smile spread across his face. 

“Your mom was a real piece of work–bet you take after her. If you can’t pay cash, we can settle it another way. Maybe let my crew have a turn–call it a discount. Fair’s fair. You don’t look like you’re worth that much anyway.” ",1,1767778297.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1q6azz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1q6azz8/my_cautionary_tale_10_days_removed/,My Cautionary Tale: 10 Days Removed,"I thought Zyn’s were safer. Cigs when younger off and on led to a vape rig in its earlier form a decade ago, led to disposal vapes and then Zyn pouches, all in the name of “it’s healthier”. I’d quit nicotine in its various forms numerous times throughout my life, always coming back to it when times are tough at work, life or relationships and never stayed strong enough to live a healthier life and keep nicotine out of mine.

Now in my late 30’s I decided to quit when I had one pouch left on 12/28 and I’m out of work so I can dedicate myself to focusing on quitting. I had been experiencing degraded health and circulation from Zyn’s that I was blind to for some time due to my addiction for Zyn.

Last Friday at 3 in the morning (night 5) I had to have my wife drive me to the ER because I felt like I couldn’t breathe and I was having chest pressure and vasoconstriction. I told them I had just quit Zyns. ER did an EKG and other tests and said your heart is fine, you’re not producing the enzyme that precedes a heart attack, you don’t have the flu or Covid, here’s your breathing treatment and you’ll be on your way.

So I make an appointment to establish care with a new PCP to get some help to improve my health, but the earliest they will accept a new patient is 5 weeks. Yay me. Seriously fuck our healthcare system.

The vasoconstriction still isn’t improving as much as I’d like on day 8, so I order a couple of humann health products: cardiovascular health and cholesterol health. Fast forward to this evening, I’m excited to receive the meds from Amazon to try and get some relief. I take the cardiovascular health pills hoping to have the artery on the left side of my neck not feel so inflamed. It actually works pretty well on first take and doesn’t feel so inflamed. I’m thrilled and feeling a little lighter mentally. I go to lay down with my wife to go to sleep, and I can’t shake this feeling that something is wrong. Breathing becomes a bit more difficult. I feel a tiny bit nauseous. My heart rate slows to under 60. I don’t trust myself to go to sleep laying flat with one pillow because it feels like I’m going to stop breathing in my sleep. I adjust to sitting up a bit more and no dice. I lay in bed for 2 hours after she’s fallen asleep, only to be scared shitless by my heart and breathing problems so I leave the bed, go to the couch in the living room to sit up and I get breathing/chest pressure relief and just cry for 10 minutes. My dogs join me from the bed to comfort me, for which I’m grateful.

For those that are unsure about sticking with it, or quitting anew, please stay vigilant in your fight against Zyn’s/nic. For you, for me, for all of your loved ones. I’m scared shitless right now that in my late 30’s I can be experiencing such cardiovascular problems to the point that I don’t think I’m going to live to 50. I’m obsessing over eating better (lost 4.2 non water weight lbs since I quit and I’m 6’0” 220), going to the gym: 90 mins each past 2 days, over 1000 cals burned each day, not drinking coffee, not consuming marijuana in any form, limiting salt intake, eating super healthy and heart focused foods, etc, but I fear my recognition of my health degrading is too late. I fear the damage that I’ve done to my heart by ignoring high cholesterol and drinking and Zyning, etc etc, has shaved decades off of my life. My wife sees my worry and she’s worried for me, and it kills me.

I read online in this forum and elsewhere that things continue to improve on the cardiovascular/heart/breathing front for weeks after quitting. I can only hope that I continue to improve and my breathing returns to somewhat normal before too long.

Thanks for reading.

When Leon Kennedy walked back into the Fairy Tail guild with Mirajane the next morning, he thought maybe, just maybe, he’d get to drink in peace.

He was wrong.
The second they stepped inside, the entire guild hall exploded.

“THE HONEYMOONERS RETURN!”

Leon froze mid-step, his coffee craving instantly replaced with dread. Mirajane’s smile twitched dangerously at the corners of her mouth.

“Who,” she said sweetly, “started this rumor?”
“Happy!” Lucy yelled from across the hall, pointing at the blue Exceed.

“Aye, sir!” Happy giggled, rolling in the air. “They had a honeymoon suite and everything!”

The guild erupted in cheers and whistles.
“Ohhh, Mira, I didn’t know you were into foreign guys!” Cana hollered, raising her mug.

“Leon!” Gray shouted, shirt already missing for some reason. “How’d you survive? Mira’s scary when she’s mad!”

“She’s scary all the time!” Natsu added, cracking his knuckles. “And you better not lay a finger on her or I’ll—”

“Relax, Sparky,” Leon called over the chaos, smirking as he strolled to the bar like he wasn’t being roasted alive. “I’m just here for the drinks. Mira already laid plenty of fingers on me.”

The guild went silent. Then—
“OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!”

Beer mugs slammed. Tables shook. Even Makarov spit out his wine.
Mirajane’s face turned redder than Erza’s hair. “L-Leon!” she shrieked, smacking him with a tray so hard it bent.

He just grinned, rubbing the back of his head. “What? Not my fault they’ve got dirty minds.”
“You are impossible,” she growled, cheeks blazing.
“And you love it,” he shot back smoothly.

The guild howled.

*Master’s Mission

Before Mira could strangle him, Makarov stood on the bar counter, looking unusually serious.
“Enough, you rowdy brats! As fun as it is to watch these two dance around their feelings—”

“We don’t have feelings!” Mirajane and Leon snapped at the same time.

“—I’ve got a job for you,” Makarov continued, ignoring them. “A dangerous one.”

The room went still.

“Scouts report strange activity on the western border. Villages destroyed, no survivors. Signs of… unnatural creatures.” His gaze darkened. “Sounds familiar, doesn’t it, Leon?”

Leon’s smirk faded, his jaw tightening. Yeah, it sounded familiar all right. Too familiar.
“You’re sending me?” he asked.

“Not just you,” Makarov said, his eyes twinkling with mischief despite the grim news. “Mira, you’re going with him.”
The guild erupted again.

“COUPLE MISSION!” Happy squealed.
“They’ll come back engaged!” Cana yelled, already taking bets.

“I’M NOT APPROVING THIS!” Natsu shouted, trying to climb onto the table, only for Gray to yank him down.

Leon just leaned back on his stool, expression unreadable. “Guess it’s you and me again, sweetheart.”
Mirajane rubbed her temples. “I hate this guild.”

*On the Road

A day later, the two of them were back on the road, bickering as always.

“You know they’re all betting on us, right?” Leon said, hands in his jacket pockets.
“Ignore them,” Mirajane muttered.
He smirked. “Can’t. Too funny. Half of them think we’ll kill each other. The other half think we’ll kiss. Personally, I’m rooting for option three.”

She glanced at him warily. “…What’s option three?”

He flashed her a grin. “Both.”
Mirajane’s face flared pink. “Y-you’re insufferable.”

Leon chuckled, but the humor didn’t reach his eyes. Because beneath all the teasing, something heavy gnawed at him. Those reports—“unnatural creatures.” It meant trouble. His kind of trouble.

And trouble always came with loss.

He glanced at Mirajane walking beside him, sunlight catching in her silver hair, her eyes narrowed in mock irritation.
For the first time, Leon wondered if his bad luck was about to catch up to her, too.


Chapter 10: Teeth in the Dark

The road west stretched long and quiet, the kind of quiet Leon hated. He’d been in enough warzones to know silence didn’t mean safety—it meant something was waiting. Watching.

Still, with Mirajane walking beside him, that silence never lasted long.

“Why do you keep looking around like that?” she asked, arms folded as if she hadn’t noticed him scanning every tree and shadow.

Leon shrugged, hands tucked in his jacket pockets. “Force of habit. You learn quick in my line of work—if it’s too quiet, something’s about to bite you.”

She arched a brow. “That’s paranoid.”
He shot her a crooked grin. “Yeah? Well, paranoia’s why I’m still alive. And why you keep staring at me, sweetheart.”

Mirajane’s cheeks flushed instantly. “I—I wasn’t—!”

“Sure,” Leon drawled, eyes forward. “It’s fine. You can look. Happens a lot.”
She clenched her fists, fighting the urge to deck him. “You are insufferable.”
“And yet,” Leon said smoothly, “you keep sticking around.”

She didn’t reply, but the corners of her mouth twitched like she was fighting a smile.
Meanwhile at the Guild…
Back in Magnolia, Fairy Tail was in chaos.
 
Again.

Cana had started a betting pool that now covered half the guild board. Wagers ranged from “Leon dies first” to “They kiss within three days.”

“Five hundred jewel says Mira snaps and kills him herself,” Gray muttered, pinning his bet to the board.
“Nah,” Natsu barked, slamming down his own. “Ten thousand says Leon kisses her first!”

Happy fluttered above them, clutching a fish. “Aye, and then Mira’ll throw him through a wall!”

Lucy sighed, face in her hands. “They’re on a dangerous mission, and you’re all gambling like it’s a soap opera.”

Cana smirked, raising her mug. “Sweetheart, in this guild, love is always more dangerous than monsters.”

*On the Road: Vulnerability

That night, Leon and Mirajane set up camp by a river. She cooked while he sharpened his knife, the fire crackling between them.

Mirajane glanced at him, noticing how his eyes kept drifting to the treeline. “You’ve been on edge all day. Even more than usual.”

Leon exhaled slowly, twirling the knife between his fingers. “…I’ve seen this before. The kind of destruction Makarov described. Whole villages wiped out overnight, no bodies left behind.”

Her smile faded. “…What kind of thing does that?”

He looked at her then, really looked. For once, no smirk, no teasing. Just tired, haunted blue eyes.

“Things I thought I left behind in my world.”
The weight of his words settled heavy between them.

Mirajane’s chest tightened. She wanted to say something, anything, but Leon smirked again, shoving the knife away. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. If anything tries to eat us, I’ll make sure it chokes.”

She rolled her eyes, but the softness lingered. “…You’re impossible.”

“Yeah,” Leon said quietly, leaning back against a tree. “But you like me anyway.”
She didn’t deny it this time.

*Teeth in the Dark

The attack came just before dawn.
A rustle in the woods. A low, wet growl. Then movement.
Leon was up in an instant, gun drawn. “Mira—wake up.”

She stirred, but the creature lunged before he could finish. A twisted, sinewy beast—its body warped, its skin pale and stretched, jaws lined with too many teeth.

Mirajane gasped, immediately shifting into her Satan Soul. Leon opened fire, bullets tearing through the monster’s hide, but it barely slowed.

“Figures,” Leon muttered, reloading smoothly. “Nothing’s ever easy.”
Mirajane slammed into the beast, claws raking, wings flaring. “What is this thing?!”
“Something I hoped I’d never see here,”

 Leon growled, rolling out of the way of snapping jaws. “Bioweapon. B.O.W.”

The creature shrieked, charging again. Leon dove low, unloading a clip into its joints while Mirajane struck high, pinning it with brute force.

For a moment, it looked like they had it—until another one burst out of the treeline.
“Of course there’s more,” Leon hissed.

Mirajane snarled, throwing the first beast aside. “Then let’s end this together.”

They moved like they’d been fighting side by side for years. Leon’s precision, Mirajane’s raw power—bullets and claws, grit and grace. Back to back, covering each other without thinking.

When the last creature fell, its corpse twitching before going still, silence returned to the forest.
Both of them were panting, bruised, bloodied—but alive.

Leon leaned on his knees, wiping sweat from his brow. “Well… that sucked.”
Mirajane, still in her Satan Soul form, looked at him—really looked. The way he kept standing even when exhaustion was written all over him. The way he’d moved without hesitation to protect her.

“Leon…” she started softly.

He glanced up, eyes locking with hers. Something raw, unguarded passed between them.
She opened her mouth—

“Don’t say it,” Leon said quickly, half-smirk, half-serious. “If you admit you like me, I’ll never let you live it down.”

Her cheeks burned. “I—I wasn’t going to—!”
“Sure,” he said, standing and holstering his gun. “You keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.”

She glared, but her heart was racing too fast to argue.
And when they walked back to camp side by side, neither of them mentioned how close they’d come—not just to death, but to something far scarier.

Chapter 11: Roast of the Century

By the time Leon and Mirajane dragged themselves back into Magnolia, both were battered, dirty, and in no mood for chaos.
Which, unfortunately, was exactly what awaited them inside Fairy Tail’s guild hall.

The second they pushed the doors open, the entire guild went silent. For a heartbeat.
Then the place erupted.

“THEY’RE BACK!” Happy screamed, zipping into the air. “AND THEY SURVIVED TOGETHER!”

“Aye, sir!”

Tankards slammed, cheers echoed, and suddenly the entire guild was swarming them.

*The First Wave

Natsu was first, of course, fists already crackling. “You survived, huh, Kennedy? What’d Mira do, carry you the whole way?”

Leon smirked tiredly. “Funny. I was gonna say the same about you and Lucy on your last job.”

Lucy immediately smacked the back of Natsu’s head. “Don’t drag me into this!”
Happy giggled. “Lucy carried Natsu and his luggage!”

Natsu’s face went red. “Shut up!”
The guild howled with laughter.

*The Roast Begins

Cana leaned on the bar, raising her mug. “So, Leon… did you and Mira enjoy your romantic getaway?”

Leon’s grin sharpened. “Oh, you mean our honeymoon? Yeah, the rose petals on the bed were a nice touch.”

Mirajane turned scarlet. “L-Leon!”
The guild exploded.

“THEY SHARED A BED?!” Elfman bellowed, veins popping in his forehead.
Lisanna clasped her hands together dreamily. “That’s so sweet!”

“IT IS NOT!” Mirajane shrieked, smacking Leon so hard he nearly toppled off his stool.
“Worth it,” he coughed, smirking through the pain.

*The Heavy Hitters

Erza crossed her arms, her gaze sharp. “I see you’ve returned intact. That speaks to your teamwork. Admirable.”

Leon raised a brow. “That it? No embarrassing question about our ‘feelings’?”

Erza tilted her head thoughtfully. “Actually… do you intend to court her properly?”
Mirajane choked on air. “WHAT?!”
The guild went dead silent, then burst into chaos.

“HE HAS TO PROVE HE’S A MAN!” Elfman roared again, slamming a fist into his palm.

Gray, shirtless as usual, leaned back with a smirk. “Pretty sure he already did. Mira hasn’t killed him yet.”

Levy scribbled furiously in a notebook. “This is better than any romance novel!”

“Damn right,” Gajeel muttered, pretending not to care while smirking at her enthusiasm.
“Bet he’s got moves,” Cana teased, wagging her eyebrows.

Leon just smirked, leaning back with his arms stretched over the bar. “Sweetheart, I’ve got so many moves, they’d have to write a book.”

“Cocky bastard,” Laxus muttered from his corner.
Freed adjusted his glasses, already blushing. “T-they do look… compatible.”

Evergreen smirked, twirling her hair. “More like combustible.”

Bickslow cackled, his floating dolls chiming, “Kiiiissss her!”

Mirajane covered her burning face with her hands. “I hate all of you.”

*The Master Speaks

Finally, Makarov banged his staff on the bar, silencing the chaos.
“That’s enough!” he declared, though his smirk betrayed him. “It’s clear to me that Leon and Mira… make quite the team. Perhaps more than just teammates.”

The guild immediately exploded again.
Leon raised his glass lazily. “Glad we’re all in agreement.”

Mirajane smacked him with her tray so hard the glass went flying. “We are NOT!”

*The Aftermath

Hours later, after the teasing had died down (barely), Leon sat at the bar nursing a drink while Mira sulked beside him, still red-faced.

“You know,” he drawled, “if we just kissed once in front of them, they’d probably get bored and move on.”

She whipped her head toward him, scandalized. “A-are you insane?!”
He smirked. “Insane? No. Genius? Absolutely.”

Her glare could’ve melted steel. But her racing heartbeat betrayed her.
And Leon, sipping his drink, decided to let her stew. After all, the game was only getting started.

Chapter 12: Passing the Torch of Embarrassment

Fairy Tail’s guild hall was quieter than usual. Which meant, of course, something was about to happen.
Leon Kennedy had barely finished his morning drink when the doors slammed open.

“GILDARTS IS BACK!”

The room exploded. Wizards scrambled to greet the returning powerhouse, mugs were raised, and even the usually composed Erza smiled.

Leon tilted his head, watching the tall, broad-shouldered man stroll in like the world owed him applause. Rugged, carefree grin, aura of confidence that filled the hall.
“Well, well,” Leon muttered under his breath. “Looks like Fiore’s got its own leading man.”
Mirajane lit up, waving warmly. “Welcome back, Gildarts!”

The man’s grin widened. “Mira! You’ve only gotten more stunning since I left.”

Leon raised a brow, sipping his drink slowly.
“Oh boy,” Cana muttered from nearby, smirking at Leon. “Better watch out. That’s the Gildarts. Even Mira flusters around him.”
Mirajane flushed slightly, waving a hand. “Don’t be silly.”

Leon leaned against the bar, his smirk sharp. “Relax. I’m not the jealous type.” He paused, eyes glinting as he looked Gildarts up and down. “Besides, he’s got nothing on me.”
The guild collectively gasped.

“HE DID NOT JUST SAY THAT,” Natsu blurted, eyes wide.

“Oh, he did,” Cana said, grinning into her mug.
Gildarts chuckled, crossing his arms. “Confident one, aren’t ya? I like that.” He glanced at Mira with a sly grin. “This the guy causing you all that trouble?”

Mirajane groaned, pinching her temples. “Please don’t encourage him.”

Leon smirked at her. “Hear that? I’m infamous now. Kind of hot, huh?”

“Kind of annoying,” she snapped, though her blush betrayed her.
The guild roared with laughter.

*The Spotlight Shifts

But then, just when Mira thought she couldn’t take more embarrassment, Leon leaned back, scanning the room with that mischievous gleam in his eye.

“You know…” he drawled loudly, “for all the teasing you throw at me and Mira, I can’t help noticing another little couple situation brewing.”

The guild froze, sensing blood in the water.
Leon smirked, raising his glass. “Natsu and Lucy.”
The silence shattered like glass.

“OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!”

Lucy nearly fell off her chair. “W-WHAT?! NO! WE’RE NOT—!”

Natsu’s face went crimson as he flailed his arms. “W-we’re just friends!”

Happy zipped between them, grinning. “Aye, and best friends always turn into loooove!”
Lucy buried her face in her hands. “Not helping!”

Leon sipped his drink with a satisfied grin. “What? You think I wouldn’t notice? The way he jumps to defend her, the way she keeps him in line, the constant bickering—textbook romance.”

“Sound familiar?” Cana teased, elbowing Mirajane.

Mira’s blush deepened. “D-don’t drag me into this!”
“Too late,” Gray chuckled, shirtless as usual. “Leon’s got a point though. Natsu’s basically the male version of Mira—loud, reckless, secretly soft.”

“And Lucy’s basically Leon,” Erza added thoughtfully. “Exasperated, sarcastic, and forever cleaning up the mess.”
The guild lost it.

Lucy groaned. “I hate all of you.”
Natsu buried his head on the table. “Make it stop!”

Leon raised his glass like a king, grinning at Mira. “See? Told you. Nice to share the spotlight.”

She shot him a dangerous glare, muttering under her breath. “…You are so lucky I can’t kill you in front of witnesses.”
He just winked. “Guess that means you’ll keep me alive. Adorable.”

*Master’s Verdict

Finally, Makarov banged his staff, silencing the room.
“Enough teasing for one day!” he declared. “But Leon makes a fair point—romance blooms in the oddest places. Maybe our guild’s next chapter is going to be full of it!”

The guild erupted again, cheers and groans alike filling the air.

Natsu and Lucy’s denials carried on for another hour, the entire guild piling on mercilessly. For once, Leon and Mira weren’t the main target.

And as Mira watched Leon smirking smugly, satisfied to have passed the torch of humiliation, she couldn’t decide whether to be grateful… or furious.",1,1767777942.0,FanficNovel,0,1.0,False

(2 years off last week)","I’m going to keep this short.

So, since last week, I’m officially 2 years off caffeine. 

Benefits: No anxiety, falling asleep fast, better anger control, no jitters, more stable blood pressure, can retain information easier. 

Cons: Everything else. 

My worst symptoms that are still persistent today are: 
Anhedonia, Fatigue, having difficulties initialising tasks, finding basic tasks nonsensically difficult (cleaning my house, brushing my teeth, ironing clothes, feels like the end of the world. It’s like somebody asks you to randomly climb Mount Everest), work (any job) feels miserable. 

These symptoms were non existent prior to quitting caffeine.

I decided to try 1 teaspoon of caffeine yesterday, and god damnit, I was able to do things without much thought that I weren’t able to force myself to do for the last 2 years, and it felt easy. 

Today I haven’t had any coffee and I want to stay on my non caffeine journey, but I’m back to having my non caffeine side effects. 

At this point I’m stumped. I’ve done every possible blood test. Even the most niche ones most people haven’t heard. I’ve checked every B vitamin in my body, every mineral, every hormone, even omegas. I went as far as checking my gut micro biome, mold toxicity, food allergies, gene tests, etc
im basically probably healthier than most Olympic athletes, yet my baseline feels like shit. 

I refuse to believe that a solution to all of this after 2 years is just some shitty coffee. 

It leads to a conclusion that either my brain somehow formed with the caffeine in mind, since I’ve started drinking it when I was like 9-10, or I have some form of undiagnosed ADHD. 
Speaking of my gene results, I have a Slow COMT, which means I naturally should have higher dopamine and norepinephrine in my brain, but it doesn’t feel like it, which makes me think these gene tests are complete BS.

At this point I don’t know what to do. I’ve made it 2 years, and I don’t want to lose any more years off my life, since I’m about to turn 27, yet I feel like I’m turning 67 without caffeine.

1q6arnb,https://i.redd.it/uok6maao9wbg1.png,Mom Funded Her Golden Child—With My Gold. Link Please?,"Chapter 1  
  
  
Growing up, Mom had this tradition.  
  
  
Every year she'd give me and my sister a piece of gold jewelry.  
  
  
""For your hope chest,"" she'd say.  
  
  
I never questioned it.  
  
  
Why would I? We were her daughters—equal in every way that mattered.  
  
  
Until last week.  
  
  
I was at the jewelry counter in Macy's when I overheard two sales associates talking.  
  
  
""You know that woman who comes in every year? The one with two daughters?""  
  
  
""Oh, the matching jewelry lady?""  
  
  
""Yeah. Except—get this—one daughter gets solid gold, the other gets gold-plated silver. Same boxes, same wrapping, totally different pieces.""  
  
  
My stomach dropped.  
  
  
That night, I tested the bangle Mom gave me last Christmas.  
  
  
Solid gold.  
  
  
The relief hit hard, followed immediately by guilt.  
  
  
Then my phone rang. Mom.  
  
  
""I mixed up your bracelet with your sister's. Bring it back.""  
  
  
My throat tightened. ""Why? Aren't they the same?""  
  
  
...  
  
  
My first paycheck cleared on a Friday. By Saturday morning, I was at Kay Jewelers.  
  
  
Growing up, Mom had this tradition.  
  
  
Every year she'd give me and my sister a piece of gold jewelry.  
  
  
""Your insurance policy,"" she'd call it. ""When you get married, you'll have something that's yours. Something nobody can take away.""  
  
  
Money was tight at our family. But Mom never missed a year.  
  
  
""I'll do without before you girls do,"" she'd say.  
  
  
Thing is, she never bought herself anything.  
  
  
So when that paycheck hit, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.  
  
  
I was comparing two pendants when I caught part of a conversation behind me.  
  
  
Two sales associates restocking nearby.  
  
  
""You know the lady with the two daughters?""  
  
  
""Yeah. Watch—she's gonna pick one in 14K, then ask us to make a matching one in vermeil.""  
  
  
""Wait, so one daughter gets real gold—""  
  
  
""And the other gets plated. Same box, same everything. Does it every year.""  
  
  
I stopped breathing.  
  
  
Two daughters. Annual jewelry tradition.  
  
  
But that couldn't be us. This store was forty minutes from home. Mom wouldn't drive all the way out here.  
  
  
""Miss?""  
  
  
The sales associate in front of me was holding up a necklace, waiting.  
  
  
""Yeah. That one's fine."" I barely looked at it. Just paid and left.  
  
  
I gripped the steering wheel the whole drive back, my mind racing.  
  
  
I went straight to Mom's place.  
  
  
When she opened the door, her face stayed flat. ""You didn't call.""  
  
  
""Wanted to surprise you.""  
  
  
She stepped aside without a word. No warmth in it, just motion.  
  
  
""Well, there's not much here. I'll probably just make some pasta.""  
  
  
""Works for me.""  
  
  
She went to the kitchen and pulled out a box of spaghetti and some wilted vegetables from the back of the fridge.  
  
  
Twenty minutes later, keys jingled at the front door.  
  
  
""Mom, I'm home!""  
  
  
My sister Brooke's voice.  
  
  
Mom's whole face changed. She dropped the wooden spoon and rushed out, arms already spreading wide. ""Honey! I didn't know you were coming too!""  
  
  
She pulled Brooke into a full embrace.  
  
  
""Sit, sit. You look exhausted. What do you want for dinner? I'll make anything.""  
  
  
Brooke kicked off her shoes and collapsed on the couch. ""Don't go crazy. Whatever's easy.""  
  
  
""Stop. You've been working nonstop—you need a proper meal."" Mom was already opening the fridge.  
  
  
I stayed where I was, watching.  
  
  
Steaks. Fresh salmon. Heavy cream, farm eggs, the expensive Irish butter.  
  
  
The fridge was packed.  
  
  
I couldn't move.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
When Mom called us to the table, I stopped in my tracks.  
  
  
Full spread. Ribeye, salmon, roasted asparagus, mashed potatoes loaded with butter and sour cream.  
  
  
All Brooke's favorites.  
  
  
I forced a smile, trying to sound casual. ""I thought you said there wasn't anything in the house?""  
  
  
Mom's eyes cut to me. She dropped her fork. It clattered against her plate.  
  
  
""You know what? I'm so tired of this.""  
  
  
""I have ALWAYS treated you two the same. Every year, I buy you both gold jewelry. Same value, same effort. But somehow I'm still the bad guy.""  
  
  
She pointed at Brooke with her knife. ""Your sister brought groceries. You rolled in empty-handed after getting your first real paycheck.""  
  
  
Brooke threw her napkin down. ""Cassie, seriously? Can we just have one normal dinner?""  
  
  
Heat crawled up my neck. That's why Mom had been cold at the door.  
  
  
I grabbed the gift bag from my purse and set it on the table. ""I didn't come empty-handed.""  
  
  
I slid the jewelry box across to her. ""Gold necklace. Got it yesterday.""  
  
  
Mom opened it. Her expression softened a fraction. ""Oh. Well... that's thoughtful.""  
  
  
She gestured at my plate. ""Eat before it gets cold.""  
  
  
But I'd completely lost my appetite.  
  
  
All I could think about was what I'd heard at Kay's.  
  
  
After dinner, I forced myself to ask. ""Mom, can I have the bangle from this year? I'd like to start wearing it.""  
  
  
She went still. Then she let out a short, sharp laugh.  
  
  
""So that's what this is about. You bought me something cheap so you could ask for your bangle back.""  
  
  
""That's for your wedding, Cassie. Not for showing off at happy hour.""  
  
  
My voice came out quieter than I meant. ""Brooke wears hers all the time.""  
  
  
""Oh my GOD, Cassie!"" Brooke shoved her chair back. ""I am so sick of you dragging me into every fight you pick with Mom.""  
  
  
She stormed off. Her door slammed so hard a picture fell off the hallway wall.  
  
  
Mom closed her eyes and took a long breath. ""She came all this way and you couldn't even let her enjoy one meal.""  
  
  
She yanked open a drawer, fished out the bangle, and dropped it in my hand.  
  
  
""Here. Take it. Happy?""  
  
  
I left early the next morning.  
  
  
Back at my apartment, I opened my laptop and typed: \[how to tell if gold is fake\]  
  
  
The bangle sat on my coffee table.  
  
  
If it was real, I was paranoid. A bad daughter who didn't trust her own mother.  
  
  
But if it wasn't...  
  
  
I pulled up a YouTube video and followed the steps.  
  
  
Solid gold.  
  
  
I should've felt relieved. Instead, guilt hit me like a truck.  
  
  
What kind of person doubts their own mom?  
  
  
At that moment, my phone rang. Mom's name on the screen.  
  
  
I answered. ""Mom—""  
  
  
""You have the wrong bracelet. Bring it back.""  
  
  
My stomach dropped. ""Wrong one? What do you mean? Aren't they the same?""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
There was a long pause on the other end.  
  
  
Then Mom's voice came back, defensive and sharp.  
  
  
""Just bring it back. Why are you making this so complicated?""  
  
  
I already knew the answer. But I needed to hear her say it.  
  
  
""Because the one you gave me is plated, isn't it? Gold over silver. That's why you need it back.""  
  
  
The line went quiet.  
  
  
My voice shook. ""You always said you treated us exactly the same. So why does Brooke get solid gold and I get fake?!""  
  
  
And suddenly all those moments I'd ignored came rushing back.  
  
  
Growing up, I wore Brooke's hand-me-downs.  
  
  
Everything. Jeans with holes in the knees, stretched-out T-shirts, shoes.  
  
  
""See? Perfectly fair,"" Mom would say. ""Brooke wore them first, now you wear them. Equal.""  
  
  
When I made honor roll and Brooke barely passed, Mom signed her up for tutoring. Two hundred bucks a week.  
  
  
""She needs help catching up to you. Otherwise it wouldn't be equal, would it?""  
  
  
When my college acceptance letter came, Mom sat me down at the kitchen table.  
  
  
""Brooke didn't go to college. If I pay for yours, that's not fair to her. You're smart—you'll figure out the loans.""  
  
  
A hundred moments just like that. My whole life.  
  
  
Mom had never been fair.  
  
  
Before I could say anything else, the line went dead. She'd hung up.  
  
  
That night, I saw Brooke's Instagram story.  
  
  
The necklace I'd bought for Mom—the one I'd saved my first paycheck for—was around Brooke's neck.  
  
  
Caption: \[Little sis threw a fit over my bracelet but Mom came through with this necklace to make it right. Fair is fair ?\]  
  
  
I stared at my phone for a long time.  
  
  
Then I opened a contact I'd blocked months ago. One message was still sitting there:  
  
  
\[Can we please talk? I miss you.\]  
  
  
My dad had been trying to reach me for years.  
  
  
Different numbers, different apps, always the same message.  
  
  
I'd never responded. Talking to him felt like betraying Mom.  
  
  
But this time I typed back: \[Coffee tomorrow?\]  
  
  
I had questions only he could answer.  
  
  
We met at a Denny's off the highway. I hadn't seen him since I was twelve.  
  
  
He looked older. Grayer. He tried to smile when I walked in, started to ask how I'd been, but I cut him off.  
  
  
""Why did you and Mom really get divorced?""  
  
  
The smile faded. He set down his coffee mug. ""She said I couldn't treat you and Brooke the same. That I played favorites. So she wanted out.""  
  
  
That lined up with what Mom had always told me.  
  
  
She'd made it sound like she left to protect me—that Dad loved Brooke more and she couldn't watch me grow up feeling less-than.  
  
  
But then he kept talking.  
  
  
""I did favor one of you. I'll admit that."" He looked down at his hands. ""But it wasn't Brooke. It was you.""  
  
  
My chest tightened.  
  
  
""Because Brooke isn't mine.""  
  
  
I just sat there, trying to process what he'd said.  
  
  
I'd always thought we had different last names because Brooke took Mom's maiden name and I took Dad's. Some families do that.  
  
  
Turns out we had different last names because we had different fathers.  
  
  
""Your mom had Brooke before we met. Then we got married, had you, and I thought we'd be a real family."" His voice got quieter. ""But after you were born, she started saying I treated Brooke differently. That I didn't love her the same way.""  
  
  
He rubbed his face. ""Maybe I wasn't perfect. But I tried. I bought you the same toys, same clothes, took you to the same parks. I really did try.""  
  
  
He looked up at me. ""Then one night we had this huge fight, and I said something I shouldn't have. I told her that yeah, maybe I felt more connected to you because you were mine, but I swore I'd never treat Brooke like she didn't belong. That I never would.""  
  
  
""She filed for divorce the next week.""  
  
  
I didn't know if I could believe him.  
  
  
He could be rewriting the whole story to make himself look better.  
  
  
But one thing was clear: Mom hadn't left to protect me.  
  
  
And weirdly, I wasn't even surprised. Just tired. Like I'd always known, deep down.  
  
  
I grabbed my purse and stood up.  
  
  
""Cassie, wait. Please. We haven't seen each other in ten years. Can't we just talk a little longer?""  
  
  
I shook my head. ""You say you had your reasons for leaving. Fine. But you didn't visit, you didn't help with anything. Mom might've played favorites, but she raised me. You didn't even try.""  
  
  
His face went pale. ""I sent child support. Every single month.""  
  
  
I froze. ""What?""  
  
  
""Every month. For years. I have the bank statements.""

me and my fiancé are going to be in Hong Kong for 1 full day and a morning in March and I made a plan but wanted some help to see what every body thinks- especially food wise! 

when we arrive at 8pm we were just going to get some easy food and then sleep 

the next day we were going to wake up early and maybe go to Lin Heung Lau (ive heard mixed reviews about here but wanted to go somewhere authentic with the dim sum carts. Also will it be hard for someone to navigate if they don’t speak Chinese to know what they are ordering) 

Then Central escalator / Mao Man Temple and Tai Ping Shan Street on Hollywood street (mid way up escalator)

Victoria Peak using the bus? and then walk down and go through the free zoo

Then for dinner I was recommended to go to fat j char Sui. is this a good place for char siu or would anyone recommend anywhere else that does char sui. i would ideally love pork meat as we can’t get pork char sui much where I live back home) 

or I also saw a lot on YouTube Sun King Yeun Curry and that looks good too!!

If time- Star ferry to mainland for Temple Night Market and Goldfish street (but don’t think this is possible) 

then the next day i wanted to go to Cheung Hing Coffee Shop and also Bakehouse for an egg tart 

and then maybe go to the monster building area? 

we are staying in Causeway bay and our flight out of Hong Kong is at 15.45 so wondered if we could go to Sun King Yeun Curry the next day before we leave?

sorry this is so much writing and I know it’s too over planned but with only 24 hours i wanted to try to eat as much amazing food as possible!!

few days ago I asked for suggestions about hyundai dealerships in coimbatore.

I went with Chandra hyundai as per votes. man they are pain in the \*\*\*. The shittiest dealer I have dealt with so far. 

Took booking without even car availability. Talked like butter before booking. after that not even a single call made from their side. If i call, response were rude toned ‘oru update um illa bro vandha solren’. Didnt inform me about the production stoppage for the year which implied no cars. 

then I found out from my friends in the domain about shortage of units since dec month. I went to and fro to the showroom 5-6 times till that. 

Since utterly disappointed with their response, i cancelled the booking amount which I paid 50% more than what hyundai india’s required amount (which i came to know from another showroom 🤦🏻‍♂️) on dec22.

the max days to return the booking amount is 4-5 days. Now I’m sitting with the booking amount stuck with them for 1.5 months. still the update from their side is ‘it will take two more days’ for the past 2 weeks. visited 3 more times to the showroom to recover the refund amount. all they say is ‘its long leave sir so only’ ‘md went abroad sir without his sign cannot proceed’. 

they literally spoiled my plans on december delivery. created a fomo. bayam kaating like this model will stop in jan for sure and all🤦🏻‍♂️

man tf is with their attitude. never once asked me ‘tea or coffee’ even after booking. but if someone pretends to be like ‘periya manusan or family’ first thing they ask is ‘coffee or tea sir?’

1q6ann4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1q6ann4/how_is_poop_getting_there/,How is poop getting there?,"Hi all, 

I'm in the middle of moving my 96 year old Grandmother across the country to a new home around the corner from me. I'm doing basically everything alone (with a little hired help) so I'm picking my battles. 

My Grandma is suffering from relatively new fecal incontinence. She doesn't get any warning and just goes almost instantly. She has had bladder leaks for a number of years, but the fecal incontinence is new. I addressed it with her GP a few months back and we learned a few things. Firstly, she frequently gets compacted stools and I believe the 'explosions' as we call it in our house are the result of that, with the liquid stool passing suddenly around the impacted one. 

We're navigating fibre supplements. Due to her medications and kidney issues we can't use psyllium husk, so we're trialing 1/2 a packet of movicol daily. I've also trialled actilax and her sustagen, which she doesn't have daily but on occasion, has a fibre booster. She is a very slim woman (around 65kg) and lives on a diet of sausage rolls, shortbread biscuits and instant coffee. She wonders why she has bowel problems, lol. In the long term I'll be returning to her new GP interstate and ordering a bowel scan, doing experimentation with the fibre supplements, and then having a follow up scan. At the moment I am booked solid every single day until we move in two weeks, so in the mean time we're cleaning, showering and washing things with sanitiser. Luckily the amount isn't big.

I should also mention she wears pull up incontinence underwear which helps clean a lot of the mess. 

Now, here is my question: how is poop getting on the back of her pants, but not the inside of her pants?

Granny is 80% there mentally and has only recently started to show small signs of senility, but no signs of dementia or alzheimers. She will suddenly need the bathroom, often starting a bit in her continence underwear, and I see her walk to the bathroom with her walker. There is no leaking, no stains or anything showing. She sits on the toilet and usually, despite my urges to not, only pulls her pants down to just above her knee/being held up by her thighs. This is because it's difficult for her to pick her pants off the floor, I think, but now she is often changing her 'underwear' so she removes everything. 

But then the poop ends up on the back of her pants, near the top and no lower than the middle of her bottom. None inside. 

How is it getting there? I swear she enters a fugue state in the bathroom because the urgency and physicality is stressful for her. 

I've obviously asked and she has no idea what's happening, but also tells white lies to save her pride. My grandmother is very receptive to care but she is proud, independent and doesn't want to be embarrassed. If this continues I'll have to watch her use the bathroom, which she would hate, or temporarily move one of her ring cameras into her bathroom to see what she is doing or what is causing it. (I know this sounds bad, but you know how the elderly 'perform' for others but change behaviour when alone.)

It's affecting her confidence and she obviously doesn't want to be dirty, no one does. 

Her new home is in a colder climate so I shall be installing fancy heated bidets with warm water, lights, the works - this will help with cleaning her whole bottom before wiping, hopefully helping with the problem. Because, as I said, I don't think it's getting on her pants BEFORE the bathroom, its being transferred AFTER. 

I am appealing to internet strangers because I have wracked my brain trying to understand how one gets poop on the back of pants and not inside them. Is it something to do with the dirty underwear? I just have no clue and before I (lovingly and regrettably necessarily) invade my Grandma's privacy I thought I could appeal to others who are carers for those with continence issues who may be able to help me understand. 

I should also mention that we have waterproof care blankets on all her soft surfaces and I'm sanitising her area daily. She is also showering at least once every 12 hours and has constant access to clean pads and clothes in all of her bathrooms. She is safe and well, it's just a bit of an embarrassing situation.

Does IRL dating work anymore?","(F21) IRL dating = meeting people through friends, work, school, etc. It feels like I’ve exhausted all my options. I kind of dislike the apps, but if required I will use them.

Are dating apps the only way? The last time I used the apps was 2 years ago. Met one guy in person who wasn’t honest about what was on his profile (substance use was a red flag for me) and we had 2 short lunches that he made very clear “were not dates”. (?? confusing but whatever). Talked to 2-3 more guys on the apps after that for 4 months max but none ever led to anything substantial. 

Earlier in 2025 I had a barely situationship with a guy i knew through friends at my college. We texted a ton but had zero physical contact. This guy also made it clear that our coffee hangout “was not a date”.

I can only come to the conclusion that in each short relationship, along with a few other 3-4 week long situationships over my college years, the problem was on my end, so there must be something wrong with me that is preventing me from dating and meeting a guy who likes me back. I also am bad at being physically flirty or playful because ive dealt with several unwanted breaches of personal physical boundaries since middle school. I am really slow to be comfortable with physical contact, but am always comfortable talking and being comfortably close without contact. My personality type could be described as INFP and soft alpha (if the omegaverse test is actually meaningful). My friends would describe me as pretty quiet, but creative.

1q6akru,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1q6akru/the_barbaric_reality_of_mental_health_care_in_bc/,The Barbaric Reality of Mental Health Care In BC: A Student Therapist's Experience,"On January 4, 2026, I attempted suicide. The next 24 hours were a nightmarish blur of begging for help but being dehumanized and treated like a prisoner instead. I will bear the scars of this experience for the rest of my life, and I don't just mean the ones on my wrists. I am sharing my story in hopes of publicizing what goes on behind closed doors and inciting awareness and change. I came away from the hospital, from the place that was supposed to help me, with new trauma and feeling more alone and scared than ever.

My name is Demi, I am from Vancouver, BC, and I am 25 years old. I am a student counselling therapist who is supposed to graduate this month. The irony is not lost on me that I have just dedicated the last couple years of my life to learning to help others be mentally well, and yet I couldn't help myself through my own mental heath crisis. Or could I? Because the staff at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) surely didn't. I made it through this experience in one piece thanks to my own strength and resilience, not thanks to the “help” provided to me at the hospital.

I would like to preface my story by saying that I do not take issue with any individual doctor, nurse, police officer, or security guard mentioned here. They are all merely cogs spinning around in a deeply flawed system.

I will now make an effort to recount the events of my brief stay at VGH with honesty, candor, and as much detail as possible.

It all started in the early afternoon of Sunday, January 4, 2026. I thought my relationship was ending and I could see no way forward, so I hurt myself in an attempt to take my life. I realized as soon as I started bleeding that I couldn't keep myself safe on my own, so I texted the suicide hotline, 988. There was a brief wait time, but the operator I spoke with, Lisa, was as caring and helpful as they could have been over text. They recommended that I call 911 or take myself to the emergency room, and they stayed in touch with me, listening and trying to help, until I got there.

I ended up taking a Lyft to the Access and Assessment Centre (AAC) at VGH. I had intended to go to the emergency department, like I'd been instructed, but I entered a slightly wrong address on Lyft and was dropped off closer to the AAC, and I didn't know how to get to the emergency department from there. I rang the doorbell and someone brought me a form to fill out while sitting in the waiting area. I filled in my basic identifying information, an emergency contact, and answers to a few questions about why I was there. I gave the form back and continued to wait, crying quietly the entire time.

Something like 15 minutes passed, and I was then ushered into an interview room in the AAC by a social worker named Amanda. She asked if I needed water or anything, which I appreciated, but didn't need as I had arrived less than 30 minutes ago. She then interviewed me for quite some time - I believe it was around 45 minutes. I explained why I was there, what I had done, and what had triggered me. I was asked about my medications and my physical health issues. I divulged a lot of information in this interview and was completely honest, as I was at that moment afraid of myself and desperate for help. I believe at one point I asked, “Can't you just admit me?” No, they couldn't do that or give me any idea what was about to happen to me until I talked to a doctor.

I was transferred to the emergency department for medical clearance because I had neglected to take my medications for the past couple of days, and they were concerned about how that was affecting my body because of my physical health issues. I was taken there in a wheelchair through the tunnels that run under VGH. That was probably the high point of the day for me, as it was interesting to see what was down there (there are a lot of pipes). I was accompanied by Amanda and two security guards.

Once we got to the emergency department, Amanda waited with me until I was admitted and triaged. I was then told to wait in a row of chairs in a hallway. I was given an electrocardiogram, they took some of my blood for blood work, and someone came to double check my information and outfit me with a hospital arm band. We discussed my emergency contact again, as it is my ex. This all happened pretty quickly, but I was then left to wait... and wait, and wait. I spent about five hours sitting and waiting in those chairs. Nobody checked on me or offered me food or water. Other patients came and went, other patients were offered water, juice, and sandwiches, but not me.

Around 8:00pm, I was finally seen by an emergency doctor, Dr. Innes. She asked me some questions and I explained the situation the same way I had explained it to Amanda the social worker earlier. I was completely open and honest and wanted to be helped. I still trusted that I would be helped, at that point.

Dr. Innes left, came back, and then informed me that I had been certified under the Mental Health Act and now was not allowed to leave the hospital. She said that a psychiatrist was on their way to assess me, and after that happened the certification could be ended or extended depending on how it went and how I was doing. Then she left, and I was once again alone in those chairs.

Two more hours passed, with me getting hungrier, more tired, and more discouraged by the minute. Nobody had any idea how long it would take for Psychiatry to see me. Eventually, just after 10:00pm, I got hungry and frustrated enough that I got up and walked out. Nobody tried to stop me. I ordered a Lyft and went home to eat waffles. At this point my emotions were still heightened, but I was no longer actively suicidal. All I wanted was to eat something and go to bed. I booked a phone call with my family doctor for the following day to see if he could offer any help, or at least give me an update on the referral to psychiatry that he had said he'd put in for me over a year ago.

While I was in the Lyft going home, I got two phone calls from the hospital. I did not pick up because the Lyft driver was playing loud music, so I wouldn't have been able to hear. I have social anxiety and I was not in a strong enough state of mind to ask him to turn it down.

I got home, prepared my waffles, and started to engage in activities that usually calm me down and make me feel better. I did not harm myself or do anything reckless. I only had about 45 minutes to take care of myself, though, before two armed and uniformed female police officers knocked at my door. I had been expecting someone to come after me, so I answered the door and cooperated when they wanted to take me back to the hospital. I was still holding out hope that maybe, finally, someone would offer some actual, tangible help. I was sorely wrong.

The police took me downstairs to wait outside for a ride. There seemed to be some confusion, as we were waiting, standing outside in the cold, for around 40 minutes. They told me that an ambulance was coming from New Westminister to take me back to the hospital, and I couldn't just go back with them because their vehicle had no backseat. As it turned out, the ambulance had gotten called somewhere else, so a third police officer showed up to convey me to the hospital with a vehicle that did have a backseat. I had my belongings (my phone and my backpack containing my wallet, all my forms of ID, some extra clothing, and my steam deck gaming console) confiscated for the ride. Nobody told me why.

We got to the hospital at around 11:30pm, my backpack and phone were returned to me, and I was readmitted. This time there was less than 10 minutes of waiting before I was called in to be triaged again. I explained to the triage nurse that I had left because I was hungry after waiting for a total of 8+ hours with no food or water. She of course told me that I could have asked for some, but my social anxiety would not have allowed me to do this at the best of times, let alone on the worst day of my life. Besides, I had overheard only egg or cheese sandwiches being offered – I would not have accepted these anyway as I do not eat animal products. This nurse also said that she had called me three times, but I have the call logs to prove that I was only called twice. I informed her why I didn't pick up, and said that if I had been called a third time when I was away from the loud music, I would have answered.

The nurse wanted me to change into scratchy hospital pajamas and grippy socks, despite the fact that I was already wearing pajamas and they were even the same colour as the hospital ones. I obliged, however, and changed in a bathroom with the two police officers waiting outside the door.

After I changed, I was brought back to the exact same chairs in the hallway where I had waited for six hours or so earlier. This time, though, I had the police staring at me and I only had to wait a few minutes before a psychiatrist, Dr. Cheng, showed up. We went into an interview room and I had to explain yet again how I had gotten myself into this situation. Dr. Cheng was curious about my medications, my family history, my current diagnoses of anxiety and depression, and if I thought I might meet the criteria for any other mental health diagnoses. She ultimately came to the conclusion that I would be staying overnight and would be reassessed by a different psychiatrist the next day.

When I came out of the interview room, the police officers were gone, as was my backpack, which one of them had been holding. I waited for a few more minutes and then a nurse came to usher me into the Psychiatric Emergency Assessment and Triage (PEAT) unit. When I asked about my backpack, all he would say was that it was locked up somewhere. As the door to the PEAT unit was closing behind me, he said, “Oh, and by the way, this is a locked unit.” This was the first I had heard of the fact hat I would now be locked up.

The PEAT unit is a room with six convertible bed-chair things and no curtains for privacy. It also has a small interview room, where I waited for a few minutes until another nurse came to show me which bed-chair would be mine. As I sat down, she said “Oh, and we have to take your phone.” At this, I became very distressed. Nobody had warned me that this would happen, and I was not okay with it happening because my phone is my lifeline to my long-distance fiancee, who was also going through a crisis. The nurses tried to reassure me that I could use their phone to call a local number in the morning, but this was entirely useless to me as my fiancee lives on the other side of the continent. I could not reason with them. They would not let me leave, they would not consider making an exception, I could not sleep in the hallway instead. I simply had to comply. It felt like they were trying to break my spirit.

I refused to give up my phone to the nurses (there were somehow two of them now), so they called security. In desperation, I tried to hide my phone in a crack of the bed-chair, where I was lying down under a blanket. Two security guards appeared and assisted the nurses in pulling the blanket from my curled-up body and removing the phone. I did not physically resist, I only laid there crying and begging them not to. They didn't have much trouble taking it away. After the phone was gone and they were still standing around me, I sat up, made eye contact with each of them in turn, and asked them if they were really okay with what they were doing to their fellow human. They wouldn't answer me or meet my eyes.

After this, Dr. Cheng appeared at the foot of my bed-chair. She tried to talk to me, but I was crying and dysregulated and didn't want to hear it, so I said I was leaving and ran into the bathroom, where I locked the door and curled up helplessly on the floor. I banged my head against the floor a few times out of frustration, hard enough that it left a red mark and a bruise, but nobody noticed or tried to stop me. A locked unit, a team of nurses, and they couldn't even keep me safe from the physical manifestation of the distress that they caused.

I remained on the bathroom floor, curled into the fetal position, until one of the nurses knocked, calling me, and said that someone else needed to use it. I didn't want to cause difficulty for a fellow patient, so I exited the bathroom immediately and went into the interview room, where I curled up on a chair. I was still there trying to sleep when another nurse entered, asking me if she could turn on the light. I said no, please, but she did it anyways.

She was there with two Ativan (also known as lorazepam, a benzodiazepine) pills, which I did not want, and the more times I said “no thank you,” the more insistent she became that I should take them. I was not anxious, I was angry for a valid reason, and I wanted to feel it. I didn't want something to “take the edge off and have a good sleep,” as she kept saying. Eventually it came out that Psychiatry (Dr. Cheng) wanted me to take these, and if I did not take the pills, they would call security again to hold me down while they injected me with Ativan instead.

“That's barbaric,” I told the nurse.

“I know,” she replied.

I weighed my options and decided that my top priority was avoiding being medicated into submission, so I grabbed the pills and put them in my mouth, but didn't swallow them, tucking them under my top lip so they wouldn't dissolve in my saliva. As soon as the pills were in my mouth, the nurse left me alone. I was able to spit them out almost immediately and hide them in the crack of the chair where I was sitting. A trace amount of them may have dissolved in my mouth, but it wasn't enough for me to feel any of the effects, thankfully.

The rest of the night passed slowly and relatively uneventfully. I was the only female in the PACT with five much larger male strangers, and I felt unsafe to sleep in my bed-chair because of that, although none of my fellow patients gave me any indication that they would harm me. I spent most of the night lying on the floor in the interview room so I could at least be alone. They asked me to lie down in the bed-chair several times but I refused. I think I got a couple hours of sleep there on the floor, but I was mostly awake, crying and thinking and trying to figure out a way to go home as soon as possible.

At around 4:00am I asked for a pencil and paper to write a letter to my fiancee. They gave me paper and two orange pencil crayons, which were a displeasure to write with but did the job. I felt a lot better after I wrote out some of my feelings, even though I couldn't send the letter until I regained access to a phone.

Nothing much happened until 8:00am, when breakfast was delivered – a dry slab of toast, a single-serve box of Rice Krispies, a fruit cup, and a package of decaf instant coffee. I am thankful that they were able to give me vegan food, but it was terribly unappetizing and all I could stomach was the fruit cup.

I was allowed to try and use the phone to call my ex, who I live with and had been unable to inform that I had been taken back to the hospital. I figured they would be worried sick about me and I simply wanted to let them know I was alive. However, the phone didn't work because my ex doesn't have a Vancouver number.

The shifts had changed and there was a new nurse, who informed me that I would be getting moved soon to a different bed in the emergency department. Sure enough, this happened at around 8:30am. I was escorted from the locked PACT unit to a bed in a corner of the emergency department, just out of sight of the exit. I was introduced to my new nurse, Martha.

I continued to ask for access to a phone to at least contact my ex, if not my own phone to contact my fiancee, but was denied. They kept saying that a social worker would come and help me sort it out, but nobody came.

I requested to be allowed to change into my clean underwear, the underwear I had brought with me in my backpack, but I was denied. I was told that I would have to change into hospital underwear, which looked like a scratchy diaper, so I decided I could stay in my day-old pair a little longer. I also requested a pillow because my new bed didn't have one, and pen and paper to draw or write more letters. I eventually got the pillow, but no pen or paper.

I had nothing to do with no phone, no book to read, and nothing to write or draw with, so I stood at the edge of my curtain, looking at the unit around me. Martha took issue with this and chastised me, telling me to stay in my care area and that the other patients didn't like being stared at. I asked if I could go for a walk around the unit because I was bored – no. I tried to go to the bathroom – no, that is a staff one and I would have to wait for Martha to escort me to a different one, until then I had to stay in my care area.

Eventually, in desperation, I waited until Martha was busy with another patient and tiptoed to the nurses' station to see if I couldn't just sneakily use the phone I saw there. She saw me and started to chastise me again, not allowing me to explain, and I had had enough. I turned tail and walked out of the hospital.

I could hear Martha calling my name, but I didn't look back and nobody tried to physically stop me, so I got out. Once I felt the kiss of fresh air on my face I started running and continued for about a block, until my body forced me to stop and vomit due to my poor physical health. I was wearing hospital pajamas and grippy socks with no shoes, no wallet, no money, no phone. I realized that I would have to rely on strangers' kindness if I was going to get out of this one.

I walked until I reached a hair salon that looked open and not too busy. I took a deep breath, stifled my social anxiety, and then entered and asked the couple working there if they by chance had a phone I could use, because it was kind of an emergency. They were hesitant at first, but I must have looked desperate enough that they took pity on me and sent a text to my ex for me, asking them to pick me up at the Tim Hortons across the street. The kind couple gave me $5 so I could get a coffee and even offered me a pair of slippers, as I had no shoes.

I thanked the couple profusely (I will be back there one day to get a haircut and leave a generous tip), walked to Tim Hortons, got an Iced Capp, and waited 20 minutes for my ex to pick me up. And then I was free. Free and unbroken, despite their best efforts.

Because of this experience, I have lost all my remaining trust in the medical system, especially when it comes to mental health care. What I needed was compassion and someone to help me remember the coping skills I already know. What I got instead was forcible confinement, indignity, and subhuman treatment that almost pushed me further over the edge.

I have been thoroughly traumatized. I now am filled with fear to the point of trembling whenever I hear sirens passing, because I worry they are looking for me to drag me back. I cower every time I see a police car. I wonder if I will develop post-traumatic stress disorder from this, but it's too early to say. All because I needed some help to come back to myself and keep living.

Accessing mental health care should not intensify a person's desire to die. The system is broken and we need reform. I am sharing my story in hopes that it can, at best, be a step towards change. At worst, I hope it can at least raise awareness and help others make more informed decisions about whether they should seek mental health care.

**Scavenger hunts as low-cost marketing events**

Instead of expensive ads or giveaways, some businesses are creating simple scavenger hunts that drive foot traffic and social sharing. Here's what makes them effective:

**For Retail/Local Business:**
- Hide QR codes around your store that lead to discounts or product info
- Partner with neighboring businesses for a ""downtown hunt"" - drives traffic to multiple shops
- Cost: Nearly free, just printing codes
- Result: People spend more time in your space, take photos, tag your business

**For Service Businesses:**
- Create a ""before & after"" photo hunt showcasing your work around town
- Educational hunts that teach people about your industry (landscapers showing plant identification, accountants with tax tip hunts)
- Builds authority while being entertaining

**For Grand Openings:**
- Much cheaper than traditional advertising
- Creates buzz through participant social sharing
- People bring friends/family, expanding reach organically

**What Makes It Work:**
1. Keep it simple - 5-7 challenges max
2. Mix physical locations with online elements
3. Prizes don't need to be expensive (free service, 20% off, feature on your social)
4. User-generated content = free marketing
5. Collect emails at the end for your list

**Real Example:**
Local coffee shop ran a ""coffee origins"" hunt around their neighborhood. Each stop had a QR code with facts about different coffee regions. 100+ participants over a weekend, gained 80 email subscribers, and 30% of participants bought coffee during/after.

The beauty is it's scalable - can be as simple or elaborate as your budget allows. Even a basic version creates memorable experiences that people talk about.

But my question is, do we really get helpful support from vendors? We have tickets opened for Microsoft that haven't been closed for years. Windows experience basically sucks now. Every new update is aimed to fix some issues from previous versions, while introducing new ones. Adobe is charging you now cancellation fees too? You no longer ""own"" games you bought with your money? Buying is not owning?

The same can be said about open-source too although I have seen open-source is quite quick in fixing issues. If they don't, you can just fork it, fix it on your own and continue using it. You can even pay/donate developers a coffee amount, ask them to fix it on priority and they'll fix it for you in less amount of time.

I get it that there are other factors at play here like in my domain, open-source alternatives are mostly cli based which users find difficult to use rather than gui based programs that proprietary ones offer. If open-source offers something good, it mostly has unpleasant UI or worse onboarding experience. It often focuses on niche things only rather than full package that closed ones offer. If we set apart this issues for a while, is blame-game the only thing that makes proprietary always win over open-source?

Before, there were more independent cafés with their own vibe and community feel. Now it feels like most people default to Starbucks, especially tourists, since it’s familiar and convenient. Tho Starbucks existed in subic since 2009.

It started with Rory. Another password reset. I opened his laptop and found the first omen: a window for “How to compile Gentoo in under ten minutes.” I closed it. It shivered. Multiplied. Great.

By noon the contagion spread. Nyla’s spreadsheets were open across three browsers Chrome Edge Firefox—bleeding formula errors and mysterious decimals. I closed a few. More appeared. Fantastic. I tried to explain the Wayback Machine to Jen but her eyes were as vacant as her “Important” folder which contained nothing but corrupted PNGs and one mysterious file named DefinitelyImportant_FINAL2_FINAL3_final_final.

Jen’s browser was a forest. YouTube tutorials on coffee. Reddit threads about Python-learning cats. Half-finished documents with names I didn’t even recognize. I clicked to close a few. The forest grew thicker. One window asked to restore the last session. I clicked No. It restored anyway. Perfect.

Slack pinged. “Stabilize the office. This is not optional.” The office manager is a flog who thinks stabilizing means holding back the digital tide with a broom.

I tried to walk away. Reality lagged. Forgotten passwords. Calendar invites I never sent. Alerts stacking like a deck of cards. My two hours for side projects—the only reason I haven’t quit—evaporated. Dev environment froze. Code? Vanished. Nothing I touched behaved the same way twice. Even the printer sighed when I walked past.

At home, lights flickered in binary. My personal laptop opened itself. Old forums. Half-finished scripts. Memes I laughed at alone. Chrome crashed. For a second I felt hope. Then it reopened.

I am no longer maintaining computers. I am maintaining chaos.

By 3:00 PM I was answering emails before they existed. Debugging errors that hadn’t occurred yet. I looked in the mirror. My eyes were too precise. Smiling a tech-support smile I didn’t authorize.

I tried to work on my side projects. Two hours. Gone. Every file warped. Every script ran against itself. Every environment whispered complaints I hadn’t written. I stretched. My chair groaned. The lights flickered again. The office felt alive.

I typed Log off. Nothing happened. I tried to close a folder. A directory tree sprouted in its place. I clicked delete. It divided into ten.

I blinked. Something else blinked first. My reflection didn’t. My reflection clicked. Complained. I don’t know which of me is real anymore. I don’t know if I’m the user or the background process.

It’s been me and my wife with her two kids for 13 years now, the last 5 full time.  Kids are 19 and 21 now and in college.  I do most of the cooking, laundry, and general house care, and put most of my attention towards my wife, getting her coffee, emotional support, loving gestures, etc, because she’s my priority.  She does those things for her kids, cooking for them, loving gestures, engaging conversation, showing interest in what they’re doing, spending time with them, much more than she does with me.  

That’s all fine, because she’s loves her kids and I understand, but I find myself getting resentful at times because the balance is off.  She’s my priority, and the kids are her priority.  She goes out of her way to be kind to them, even when they’re not kind to her, to be forgiving, patient, engaging, and plan activities with them in ways that she doesn’t with me.  She only cooks if it’s for them or the family, never for me.  She drops her phone or turns off the tv as soon as they walk in the room and engages them enthusiastically, and proactively plans time and vacations with them, while most of the time I feel like a bit if a fixture, and I’m the only one who proactively plans time together or vacations for the two of us.  

Maybe this is common in most marriages, step or not, but while my first marriage had a lot of problems, I didn’t feel this raising our two kids with my then wife.  Our relationship came first (it was her alcoholism that broke us up).  

Do those of you who are married and in a stepparent role feel this?  Do you feel resentful or pull back on your spouse to try to obtain some sort of balance, or just accept that the kids will always be the priority?

My boyfriend(39) and I(29) always get into arguments and (literal) fights, always for the past 8 years (because im dumb). One time he almost broke my nose. That was because I accidentally kicked him in the nuts. He did it because ""I did it with anger"". All I remember is, it was an accident and as soon as I did it, I apologized. But he punched me in the face. Another time he broke my tablet outside in the backyard. That was because I bit him so hard that he bled. But that was because he was grabbing at me for my cigarettes while I kept telling him to hold on so I can grab them for him. I also remember another time we were walking downtown and he caused a scene because I wanted my $20 bill on me not him. Recently we got into an argument about how i sound ""snappy"" to the point he escalated it to the point he was yelling in my face, put a hole in the wall and threatened me by saying he wished that was my face he smashed into the wall. Another time recently he called me a ""cunt"" and a ""bitch"" and yelled it at me because I laughed and called him a ""dipshit"" about something (I dont remember what it was) I was trying to be funny and he said it was because I apparently sounded angry or something. Today, he started an argument because I said that he could've waited to make a coffee for a few more minutes so I can get up and actually sit down and have a hot coffee because he usually does that and I wasn't even out of bed yet. I tried telling him to be quiet for a few minutes so I can calm down and he didn't do that instead he has to get the last word in. So I kept repeating myself. He didn't stop and ended up making me cry a bit (im a crier, hate it). He also ignores the fact he did what he did while i sit there and try to apologize. He doesn't talk about it so I pretend it didn't happen. He will call me names and put me down in arguments and if he said he'd get me something the next day and we get into it, he'll threaten to take that away. I cry and he basically yells at me and says ""here we go again"". But most of the time I'm crying because of him. 

But when he's not like that, he's a gentleman to me. Kisses me goodnight or goodbye when he leaves, is just nice to me and says he loves me. Also talks to me politely. 

Ps. We don't have sex, haven't in 7 years. He says it's because of a problem he's been having but he won't go through help for. (Caught him jerking off once and he slept with my cousins gf(25) and my cousin(31) watched and told me he got hard, ended up with 2 videos, unfortunately 😑). 

Also, I have mental health issues and he plays on those and tells me yeah right about them... blah blah blah...

1q6a5t1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6a5t1,"GEO, LLMO, AIO oder doch noch SEO?","**In der dynamischen Welt des Online-Marketings scheint kein Stein auf dem anderen zu bleiben. Begriffe wie Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), Large Language Models (LLMO) und AI Overviews (**[**AIO**](https://www.paseo-marketing.de/glossary/aio/)**) schwirren durch die Branche und stellen die altehrwürdige Suchmaschinenoptimierung (SEO) vor eine scheinbare Zerreißprobe. Doch ist SEO wirklich tot, oder entwickelt es sich nur weiter? Dieser Artikel taucht tief in die aktuellen Entwicklungen ein, erklärt die neuen Begriffe und zeigt auf, wie Sie Ihr Unternehmen fit für die Zukunft der Suche machen können.**

  

# Was bedeuten GEO, LLMO und [**AIO**](https://www.paseo-marketing.de/glossary/aio/) eigentlich?

Es gibt verschiedene Ansätze, um die Conversion Rate einer Website zu verbessern. Ein positives Nutzererlebnis (UX) ist entscheidend, da Besucher länger auf einer benutzerfreundlichen und schnell ladenden Seite bleiben. Ebenso wichtig ist es, Vertrauen aufzubauen, zum Beispiel durch Kundenbewertungen und gut platzierte Call-to-Actions (CTAs) zu verwenden. Auch personalisierte Inhalte und interaktive Elemente wie Live-Chats oder Umfragen können die Nutzererfahrung und Conversions fördern.

# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

Generative Engine Optimization beschreibt die Optimierung von Inhalten speziell für generative KI-Systeme. Ziel ist es, dass diese Modelle Ihre Inhalte als vertrauenswürdige und relevante Quelle für ihre generierten Antworten heranziehen. Es geht nicht mehr nur darum, in den klassischen organischen Suchergebnissen zu ranken, sondern in der direkten Antwort, die ein Nutzer von einer KI erhält, zitiert zu werden. Das bedeutet, dass Ihre Inhalte so strukturiert sein müssen, dass die KI sie leicht verarbeiten, verstehen und als Faktenbasis nutzen kann. Dies erfordert eine neue Herangehensweise an die Content-Erstellung, bei der Klarheit, Expertise und Autorität im Vordergrund stehen.

# Large Language Models Optimization (LLMO)

Large Language Models, kurz LLMs, sind die eigentlichen Arbeitstiere hinter dieser Entwicklung. Sie sind riesige Sprachmodelle, die auf gigantischen Datenmengen trainiert wurden, um menschliche Sprache zu verstehen und zu generieren. \[cite\_start\]Die Optimierung für diese Modelle, Large Language Model Optimization (LLMO), wird oft als „Black Box“ bezeichnet, da ihre Funktionsweise nicht vollständig transparent ist\[cite: 1\]. Dennoch gibt es erprobte Methoden aus der klassischen SEO, die sich auch hier anwenden lassen, wie die Arbeit mit strukturierten Daten (Mark-ups) und eine durchdachte Content-Strategie. Die größte Herausforderung ist die Anfälligkeit dieser Modelle für Manipulationen durch sogenannte Prompt Injections oder Adversarial Attacks, was zu unerwarteten oder falschen Ausgaben führen kann.

# AI Overviews (AIO) – Der Game-Changer?

AI Overviews ([AIO](https://www.paseo-marketing.de/glossary/aio/)), auch bekannt als Google SGE (Search Generative Experience), sind die direkten, von KI generierten Zusammenfassungen, die Google in den Suchergebnissen anzeigt. Diese AIOs positionieren sich ganz oben, noch vor den klassischen organischen Ergebnissen. Das hat weitreichende Konsequenzen:

Verschiebung der Klicks: AIOs absorbieren einen Großteil der Klicks. Studien zeigen, dass es auf dem Desktop nur noch die Top-2-Positionen in den AIOs sind, die relevante Klicks erhalten. Die organische Sichtbarkeit nimmt dadurch drastisch ab. Neue Relevanz-Definition: Es reicht nicht mehr, nur auf Seite 1 zu stehen. Der Erfolg hängt nun davon ab, ob Ihre Inhalte in der generierten KI-Zusammenfassung zitiert werden. Dies verschärft den Wettbewerb um die Vorherrschaft als vertrauenswürdige Quelle.

Dieser Wandel macht deutlich, dass die Suchintention der Nutzer sich ändert. Sie suchen nicht mehr nur nach Links, sondern nach direkten, prägnanten Antworten. Das stellt die traditionelle SEO vor neue Herausforderungen und erfordert eine grundlegende strategische Neuausrichtung.

1q6a5er,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Brave-Tumbleweed3392/comments/1q6a5er/travel_tales_rappelling_at_konkankada_maharasthra/,"Travel Tales | Rappelling at Konkankada, Maharasthra","Getting to Kokankada involved more modes of transport than a Choose Your Own Adventure book. Bus. Train. Another train. Then a shared jeep driven by someone who treated potholes like personal enemies. By the time we started walking, my legs had filed a formal complaint, but somewhere between the wet earth and relentless green, exhaustion turned into attention.

The cliff appeared the way good plot twists do. One step, solid ground. Next step, the earth had ghosted me entirely. Just air and a half-dome of dark basalt dropping away like the world's most dramatic mic drop. I laughed out loud because what else do you do when geology punches you in the existential gut? Metallica's *Orion* started playing in my head uninvited, and I stood there thinking: when was the last time I felt this small and this alive all at once?

Kokankada doesn't show off. The basalt stacked in horizontal layers like the earth was taking meticulous notes in stone. Flood basalt from the Deccan Traps, someone explained. 66 million years ago, India had the world's worst case of volcanic indigestion, and this cliff is basically ancient lava heartburn that solidified with better posture.

Then came the gear talk, and things got beautifully nerdy.

""Kernmantle construction,"" our instructor announced, holding up the rope like a professor with a star student. ""Kern means core, mantle means sheath. German engineering applied to not dying."" The core carries 70% of the load...nylon fibers that stretch just enough to absorb shock but not enough to turn rappelling into bungee jumping. It's rated for 22kN, roughly 5,000 pounds. ""Enough to suspend a small car,"" he added, ""so you'll be fine.""

Someone asked about dynamic versus static rope. Cue a 15-minute tangent. Dynamic rope stretches 8-10% to catch falls, critical for rock climbing. Static rope (what we were using) stretches less than 5%, which is what you want for rappelling because bouncing down a cliff face isn't actually fun, despite what cartoons suggest. I made a mental note: dynamic for climbing, static for rappelling, don't mix them up unless you enjoy surprise physics lessons.

The harness came with more instructions than Lego set. ""Double-back your waist belt. If you don't, the webbing can slip, and then you're testing human flight capabilities. Spoiler: we can't."" Leg loops snug but not tourniquet-tight. ""You want blood flow. Gangrene is bad for our Trek reviews.""

Carabiners clicked into place; aluminium alloy, rated for 20-25kN, with screw gate locks because ""gravity doesn't take coffee breaks."" Someone joked about trusting our lives to fancy string and expensive keychains. Someone else launched into a sermon about carabiners being the Swiss Army knife of not dying.

The Figure 8 descender, shaped exactly like its name, creates friction by threading rope through its holes. ""Friction is your friend,"" our instructor said. ""Friction keeps you from experiencing terminal velocity first-hand."" ( I giggled so bad here.)  The device gets hot during long descents (metal conducting heat from rope friction) which is why you never grab it directly.

And the basalt itself. The real MVP. ""Igneous rock. Formed when lava cools quickly,"" our geology nerd explained with barely contained glee. ""Fast cooling means small crystals, dense rock. Basalt doesn't flake. It's been here 66 million years and it's not going anywhere."" Each horizontal band was a separate lava flow, stacked like pancakes made by a very patient volcano. ""The earth was basically printing basalt for thousands of years, one sheet at a time.""

My turn. I clipped in, checked knots twice (paranoia is underrated), and leaned back. Leaning over a cliff goes against every instinct evolution perfected. My lizard brain screamed. My prefrontal cortex explained physics. I chose physics.

The rope sang through the Figure 8. My feet found the rock. It was worn smooth by wind in places, rough with crystals in others. This rock had seen monsoons for millions of years and remained fundamentally unbothered.

The descent became some sort of a rhythm. Push away from the rock. Let rope slide through the descender. Feet find the wall. Weight shifts. Repeat. My right hand controlled the brake; pull rope toward my hip for friction, let it angle out to descend faster. My left hand stayed above the descender, guiding but never gripping too tight. ""Light hands, heavy feet,"" our instructor had said. ""Let the equipment do the work. You're just conducting the orchestra."" 

The cliff curved inward. For a moment I hung in open air, the valley spreading beneath me in endless green. The waterfall ran beside me, mist brushing my face.. I paused halfway down and just *existed*.  Just me, rope, rock, and a waterfall older than language. The harness held me completely. The rope stretched slightly, maybe 3-4%, just enough to feel alive in my hands.

A bird flew past at eye level, entirely unconcerned with my presence. I thought about how we're the only species that needs elaborate equipment to descend cliffs. Birds just… do it. Then again, birds never invented jazz or built the Hubble telescope, so maybe our neurotic relationship with gravity has its advantages.

My hands managed friction without conscious thought. My feet read the rock like Braille. My body and the cliff moved together in a rhythm I didn't have to invent, it was majorly muscle memory and physics collaborating in real time. At the bottom, I unclipped and looked up at Kokankada, still radiating the energy of something that will outlast everything I was ever worried about.

What stayed wasn't the adrenaline.. It was the simplicity of what I witnessed and experienced.  

Also, kernmantle construction is genuinely fascinating and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.

*Orion* still plays in my head sometimes when I remember that day. Understanding that some things are worth taking your time with. Like 66-million-year-old basalt. Like learning to trust rope and friction. Like standing at the edge and realizing the edge was never the point.

The point was always the descent.",1,1767775044.0,u_Brave-Tumbleweed3392,0,0.99,False

My boyfriend(39) and I(29) always get into arguments and (literal) fights, always for the past 8 years (because im dumb). One time he almost broke my nose. That was because I accidentally kicked him in the nuts. He did it because ""I did it with anger"". All I remember is, it was an accident and as soon as I did it, I apologized. But he punched me in the face. Another time he broke my tablet outside in the backyard. That was because I bit him so hard that he bled. But that was because he was grabbing at me for my cigarettes while I kept telling him to hold on so I can grab them for him. I also remember another time we were walking downtown and he caused a scene because I wanted my $20 bill on me not him. Recently we got into an argument about how i sound ""snappy"" to the point he escalated it to the point he was yelling in my face, put a hole in the wall and threatened me by saying he wished that was my face he smashed into the wall. Another time recently he called me a ""cunt"" and a ""bitch"" and yelled it at me because I laughed and called him a ""dipshit"" about something (I dont remember what it was) I was trying to be funny and he said it was because I apparently sounded angry or something. Today, he started an argument because I said that he could've waited to make a coffee for a few more minutes so I can get up and actually sit down and have a hot coffee because he usually does that and I wasn't even out of bed yet. I tried telling him to be quiet for a few minutes so I can calm down and he didn't do that instead he has to get the last word in. So I kept repeating myself. He didn't stop and ended up making me cry a bit (im a crier, hate it). He also ignores the fact he did what he did while i sit there and try to apologize. He doesn't talk about it so I pretend it didn't happen. He will call me names and put me down in arguments and if he said he'd get me something the next day and we get into it, he'll threaten to take that away. I cry and he basically yells at me and says ""here we go again"". But most of the time I'm crying because of him. 

But when he's not like that, he's a gentleman to me. Kisses me goodnight or goodbye when he leaves, is just nice to me and says he loves me. Also talks to me politely. 

Ps. We don't have sex, haven't in 7 years. He says it's because of a problem he's been having but he won't go through help for. (Caught him jerking off once and he slept with my cousins gf(25) and my cousin(31) watched and told me he got hard, ended up with 2 videos, unfortunately 😑). 

Also, I have mental health issues and he plays on those and tells me yeah right about them... blah blah blah...

1q6a07l,https://i.redd.it/br06cy341wbg1.png,Help me find - Silent Devotion: When My Cold Marriage Turns Burning Hot,"Chapter 1 I'm Dayna's Husband  
""Did you know Michael came back to town?"" asked the woman beside Dayna Clarke, her smile gleaming in the restaurant's private room.   
  
The evening had started light, just a bunch of college friends catching up. The room had felt full of laughter until the woman mentioned Michael Barnett. The energy drained at once. Suddenly, every gaze landed on Dayna, curious and expectant.   
  
Dayna sat among them, her presence almost glowing beneath the overhead lights.   
  
She raised her glass, voice calm. ""I didn't hear about it.""  
  
A different friend leaned forward. ""You two were joined at the hip. We all thought you'd be together for good. It's wild you ended up with someone else. Michael's running Apex Entertainment now. Ever wonder if you made the wrong choice?""  
  
Another woman laughed. ""Your husband's got money, but come on--Michael's on another level. Nobody forgets their first love.""  
  
Laughter spread around the table.   
  
With the w\*\*e settling in, Dayna felt a bit dizzy. The conversation was starting to wear her out. She grabbed her purse and stood. ""You all keep going. I need some air.""  
  
""Heading home already? Afraid your husband's going to call?""  
  
As two men stepped in, Dayna glanced up. She caught sight of Michael in the back.   
  
Three years had gone by. He wore a sharp black suit now, which made him look even more imposing. His eyes found hers right away.   
  
The first voice belonged to Louis Gilbert, Michael's old roommate.   
  
When Michael showed up, every woman in the room seemed to sit up a little straighter. He was the campus star years ago, and not much had changed.   
  
Louis tilted his head toward Dayna, a trace of ridicule flashing across his face as his mouth twisted. ""Why don't you call your husband over? He can sit with us.""  
  
""He's on a business trip. I should head out anyway,"" Dayna replied. She did not spare Michael a glance. After giving Louis a brief, courteous nod, she turned and walked away.   
  
Once she disappeared, Louis leaned closer to Michael and scoffed, ""Did you see that? She won't even look at you. She ditched you for a richer guy back then. Someone like her has no business showing up here.""  
  
Michael stayed silent. Without a word, he pivoted and followed the path Dayna had taken.   
  
Caught off guard, Louis stared after him. ""Hey. Where are you going?""  
  
Outside the elevator, Dayna moved toward the main entrance, heels clicking against the floor.   
  
""Dayna."" Michael suddenly stepped into her path and seized her arm. ""You're running the second you see me. What's wrong? Feeling ashamed?""  
  
The force of his grip made her sway. She regained her balance, lifted her eyes to his, and spoke flatly. ""Let go of me.""  
  
He ignored her. Instead, he yanked her closer and used his height to block her escape. ""You left me to marry him, yet he can't even afford decent jewelry for you. Is this really the life you wanted?""  
  
""My choices don't concern you,"" Dayna shot back. She twisted her arm hard, trying to wrench free.   
  
They were still locked in that tense struggle near the entrance when a black Lamborghini slid to a stop beside them.   
  
The license plate registered in Dayna's mind instantly, and a flash of recognition crossed her face.   
  
As he picked up on her reaction, Michael's gaze shifted in the same direction, his expression turning stormy.   
  
From the car, a tall man stepped into view. His arrival brought a chill to the warm evening, commanding everyone's attention.   
  
In one swift movement, Dayna freed herself from Michael's grip and hurried over. ""You told me you wouldn't be back until tomorrow night.""  
  
Vincent Clarke, her husband, closed the distance in a heartbeat, settling an arm around her waist as though it belonged there. ""Wrapped things up sooner than planned,"" he replied, his words carrying that familiar, steady confidence. ""I wanted to come home early.""  
  
The sight of Dayna so comfortable in Vincent's arms made something flicker behind Michael's eyes.   
  
Turning at last to Michael, Vincent took stock of the man before him, but he spoke to Dayna. ""Someone you went to school with?""  
  
A pause followed as Dayna processed the question. She managed a nod, feeling the tension in the air grow heavier. He already knew about her history with Michael, and that only added to the awkwardness.   
  
Vincent acknowledged Michael with a measured nod, then faced him directly. ""I'm Dayna's husband. Good to meet you.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 2 You Drank  
Vincent's introduction carried more weight than a simple greeting. There was no mistaking the underlying message.   
  
He had witnessed the exchange between Dayna and Michael, missing nothing.   
  
""We're leaving."" With quiet authority, Vincent drew Dayna close and steered her toward the waiting car.   
  
The drive back unfolded in silence, tension filling the space between them.   
  
Noticing the shift in Vincent's mood, Dayna wondered if Michael's sudden appearance had rattled him. Perhaps it left him uneasy--or maybe even irritated.   
  
She hesitated, unsure if Vincent was upset, but felt compelled to speak up.   
  
""We just planned a simple dinner with old friends from university. I had no idea Michael would be--""  
  
Before she could finish, Vincent reached for a small shopping bag and set it on her lap. ""I got you something.""  
  
Her eyes widened in surprise as she accepted the gift.   
  
Though their marriage had lasted three years, Vincent's work kept him away most of the time. Still, he never returned without bringing her a token from his trips.   
  
Now she questioned if he was truly upset.   
  
The package felt almost too warm in her hands. Unsure, she bit down on her lip and sneaked a glance at him.   
  
Vincent leaned back with his eyes closed, head resting on the seat, making it clear he had nothing more to say.   
  
Without pressing further, Dayna rolled the window down a little, letting the night air brush against her skin and clear her mind, still hazy from the evening's drinks.   
  
Recollections surfaced from three years ago, when Roberts Group stood on the brink of collapse.   
  
Glenn Roberts, her father, seized on the family's old agreement with the Clarkes, insisting she honor the childhood engagement and marry Vincent. Glenn believed this union was the only way to keep their company afloat.   
  
Roberts Group was her mother's legacy, the only thing she had left to remember her by. Letting it fall apart wasn't something she could accept.   
  
At the same time, her relationship with Michael had been rocky. He was unpredictable, overwhelmed by the pressure of building his company from the ground up, and their constant arguments eventually pushed her to walk away.   
  
Marriage to Vincent followed, though his manner stayed cool and reserved. Conversation between them was minimal, but he always treated her with respect.   
  
Their home in Crescent Bay had become her new world after the wedding.   
  
Once the car glided into the underground garage and settled in its spot, David Cooper glanced back at them. ""We're here, Mr. and Mrs. Clarke.""  
  
Dayna, nearly dozing, snapped awake at the announcement, just in time to hear Vincent say, ""Go on, David. Head home for the night.""  
  
""Of course, sir."" With that, David stepped out and disappeared into the evening.   
  
Dayna started to open her door, but Vincent's fingers circled her wrist, stopping her.   
  
A gentle tug brought her tumbling right into his lap.   
  
Surprise escaped her lips. Her knees bent, landing her as\*\*ide him without warning.   
  
Blush spread from her cheeks to her neck as she realized their positions. She tried to move, pushing herself up, but Vincent refused to let go.  
  
His hand pressed firmly at her back, bringing her even closer until their bodies met, heartbeat to heartbeat. The warmth radiating between them left no doubt about his intentions.   
  
""Vincent, let me go,"" she whispered, her voice trembling with embarrassment and anticipation. She understood the situation all too well and tried to slip away.   
  
Vincent didn't answer. Instead, he cupped her chin, lifted her face, and captured her lips in a deep, possessive k\*\*s.   
  
Flustered, Dayna braced her palm against his ch\*\*t and tried to create distance. Vincent had never been subtle about what he wanted, but he always knew where to stop. Tonight, restraint was nowhere to be found.   
  
Warm hands framed her face as his breathing turned uneven, the k\*\*s deepening until it stole her sense of place. An arm locked around her waist, anchoring her firmly against him.   
  
Minutes slipped by without shape or order. When he finally pulled away, her lips tingling from the intensity.   
  
Strong fingers caught her chin, guiding her gaze upward until she had no choice but to meet his eyes. His voice came out low and rough. ""So tell me. Did you have fun seeing everyone again tonight?""  
  
Even through the haze of al\*\*hol, Dayna could sense the shift in him.   
  
This wasn't like Vincent. He was controlled, composed. This edge was new.   
  
She started to speak, ready to explain, but his grip tightened around her waist before she could finish a single word, pressure biting just enough to make her g\*\*p.   
  
His gaze lingered on her mouth, dark and assessing. ""You drank,"" he said flatly.   
  
She nodded, unable to deny it.   
  
""And what did I say about that?"" he pressed on.   
  
Her teeth caught her lower lip as her hand fisted in his shirt.   
  
Al\*\*hol had never agreed with her. Once, she drank too much and wandered into traffic, ending up in the emergency room.   
  
The call went straight to Vincent, and he left an important meeting without hesitation to get to her. After that night, he made it clear. No more dr\*\*king.   
  
Still, she had crossed that line tonight. He wasn't sure if Michael's sudden return played a part, but the unease settled heavy in his ch\*\*t.   
  
Slowly, Vincent's hand traced along her side, the touch deliberate and unhurried.   
  
The tension beneath his calm surfaced in the way his fingers tightened, drifting lower until his palm sl\*\*ped beneath the edge of her dress, making his intent unmistakably clear.   
  
  
  
Chapter 3 I Promise It Won't Happen Again  
""Everybody kept passing drinks around. I didn't want to make a scene, so I just went along. I promise it won't happen again,"" Dayna said.   
  
Her words came out gentle and careful, but Vincent's icy silence didn't waver. She tried to offer more, but then his hand made his intentions clear, stealing the breath right out of her.   
  
Color rushed to her face, and she ducked her head, voice barely more than a whisper. ""Can we... wait until we're inside?""  
  
""No,"" he responded, the word brooking no argument, firm and commanding.   
  
Patience had never been Vincent's strong suit. In one swift move, he caught her dress and pu\*\*ed it free.   
  
The yellow dress she had chosen for the night proved no match for Vincent's determination. Her un\*\*rgarments soon followed.   
  
The stillness of the garage was broken only by the metallic snap of his belt buckle, the sound echoing in the empty space.   
  
The Lamborghini rocked gently as they moved together.   
  
Night air drifted in from outside, but the heat between them quickly outpaced the chill. Their gazes locked, both of them fierce and hungry for more.   
  
Her mind went blank, lost in the haze of sensation.   
  
When it was finally over, Vincent got dressed, wrapping her gently in his jacket before lifting her from the back seat.   
  
By the time they entered the house, Dayna had already fallen asleep. Her cheeks still glowed with color, and sweat dampened her lashes. Even in rest, she looked troubled, softly muttering in her dreams.   
  
Regret crept in--maybe he had let things get too intense.   
  
He carried her to the bathroom, drawing a warm bath to soothe her before settling her into bed. Only when she was tucked beneath the sheets did he slip away to shower.   
  
Soon after, dressed in a robe, Vincent stood in silence at the window. The city stretched out below him as he lit a ci\*\*rette, his face gh\*\*tly in the shifting shadows of sm\*\*e.   
  
A call broke the quiet. Zayne Adams, his assistant, spoke on the line. ""Mr. Clarke, someone from Apex Entertainment is asking questions about you.""  
  
Vincent's jaw tightened as Michael's name crossed his mind. He didn't respond, simply ended the call after a moment's pause.   
  
He had known the whole story--how Dayna had ended things with Michael and chosen to marry him instead. That had all happened three years ago, well before the wedding.   
  
Now Michael was back, stirring up what Vincent hoped would stay buried.   
  
The tip of his ci\*\*rette glowed as he exhaled, sm\*\*e curling around his brooding expression.   
  
He was supposed to be away for business, his trip scheduled to last a few more days. The second news of Michael's return reached him, he had cleared his agenda and caught the first flight home.   
  
He made it to the restaurant just as Michael cornered Dayna outside. Once, she had loved Michael fiercely. If that man came back, would those feelings come with him?   
  
Gazing out at the city, Vincent let his face slip into shadow, his thoughts hidden beneath the drifting sm\*\*e and the hush of midnight.   
  
...   
  
Morning crept in, painting the sky with soft gold before Dayna finally stirred from sleep.   
  
It was nearly nine when she slipped out of bed, stretching off the last traces of exhaustion.   
  
Crossing the hall, she stopped short. Vincent was still at home, seated at the dining table with his laptop open.   
  
Normally, he would have left for work hours ago. Today, he lingered.   
  
Gathering her courage, she made her way over, legs slightly unsteady, and saw that breakfast had already been set for two.   
  
Vincent shut his laptop and set it aside. ""Have some breakfast,"" he said, his voice as steady as ever.   
  
She slid into the chair beside him, and the housemaid appeared with two steaming cups of milk.   
  
Silence settled between them as Vincent began to eat, each motion calm and precise. He never spoke while he was eating--a habit she had come to expect.   
  
After a few minutes, the maid placed his favorite morning magazine at his elbow. He always read something during breakfast, another small ritual.   
  
Glancing down, Dayna caught a glimpse of the cover--and felt her stomach drop.   
  
A familiar image stared back at her.   
  
Noticing her sudden stillness, Vincent picked up the magazine and looked it over.   
  
Splashed across the front page in bold print: ""Apex Entertainment's New President Reunites With His First Love--Old Sparks Ignite.  
  
The photo featured last night's encounter outside the restaurant. Michael's face was shown clearly, and though only her profile appeared beside him, anyone who knew Dayna would recognize her instantly.   
  
  
  
Chapter 4 Make That Story Disappear  
A knot formed in Dayna's stomach as she caught sight of her own profile on the magazine cover. Without thinking, she glanced at Vincent, worried he would take it the wrong way. ""I was just heading home last night--""  
  
Her voice faltered when she saw Vincent open the magazine.   
  
He turned the pages until he reached a full spread that laid out every detail of her history with Michael.   
  
Irritation flared. Why would anyone waste time spinning this into a headline?   
  
She opened her mouth to set things straight, but the phone rang, breaking the tension.   
  
Vincent answered, and Zayne's voice filtered through. ""Mr. Clarke, Michael Barnett went public with a press conference this morning. He's telling everyone he and his first love are back together. Apex Entertainment is running with it. It won't take long before people realize he's talking about Mrs. Clarke.""  
  
A cold silence filled the room.   
  
Seated so close, Dayna heard every word. Panic shot through her. She leapt to her feet, voice ringing with urgency. ""That's a lie. Michael and I haven't spoken in years!""  
  
She reached out to grab the phone, nearly losing her balance in her haste. Vincent caught her around the waist, steadying her without breaking stride, his focus still on the call.   
  
His words were ice. ""You have one minute. Make that story disappear.""  
  
""Yes, sir."" Zayne's reply was crisp before the call ended.   
  
The magazine featured a photo of a pair of matching watches, claiming they were symbols of a love that had never faded.   
  
Vincent remembered seeing a woman's watch--identical to the one in the photo--tucked away in Dayna's vanity drawer, matching the one shown in the spread.   
  
Maybe if she hadn't kept the watch, he would believe her heart was truly free from the past.   
  
Vincent's silence pressed in around her, and worry twisted in Dayna's gut.   
  
Without another word, he rose from the table and strode toward his study. ""I have work to do. Eat your breakfast,"" he said, his tone flat and final.   
  
Once inside, he sat behind his desk, opened his laptop, and stared at the screen without seeing a thing.   
  
His mind wandered back to a call just two days ago. She had answered while visiting her family, and he had overheard the entire conversation.   
  
The pressure from the Roberts family had been relentless--pushing her to give him a child, as if a baby would tie their fates and fortunes together.   
  
For her family's sake, Dayna had stayed in this marriage, bound by responsibility instead of de\*\*re.   
  
Meanwhile, in the living room, Dayna found herself restless and uneasy.   
  
She paced the hallway outside his study, then finally tapped on the door.   
  
""Come in.""  
  
Vincent's voice, muffled but unmistakable, reached her from inside.   
  
Sunlight filled the room, pooling gold across polished floors.   
  
Behind his desk, Vincent looked every inch the composed businessman, surrounded by piles of documents and quiet command.   
  
He raised his eyes, steady and unreadable. ""Is something wrong?""  
  
Dayna stepped closer, her hands twisting nervously. ""I don't know if you let that story get to you, but I wanted you to hear my side.""  
  
A flicker of surprise crossed Vincent's face, his pen slipping from his grasp and clattering onto the desk.   
  
Dayna kept her voice low and steady. ""I had no idea Michael would be there last night. There's nothing between us, not anymore. And about that watch--people have it all wrong. It was a birthday gift from my mother when I turned eighteen. Michael only bought the same one because he liked the style. That's the whole story.""  
  
She finished, raising her eyes to see how he would take it.   
  
She finished, raising her eyes to see how he would take it.   
  
Vincent's face gave away nothing, unreadable as ever.   
  
He wondered, was she trying to convince him for his sake--or just afraid he would take his anger out on her family?   
  
Just then, her phone buzzed. She glanced down. It was Clara Gordon, her assistant.   
  
Uncertain, Dayna hesitated, but her thumb brushed the answer button by accident.   
  
Clara's voice rang out in the study, slicing through the quiet. ""Dayna, the chairman needs you at the office right now.""  
  
""Understood."" She hung up, turning to say more to Vincent, only to see him already standing, reaching for his jacket.   
  
""I'm heading out too. I'll drive you,"" he said, pausing only long enough to meet her eyes before moving for the door.   
  
Words still caught in her throat, Dayna hurried after him.   
  
Outside, the car idled by the curb. Vincent stood by the open door, waiting. When he realized she wasn't right behind him, he glanced over his shoulder.   
  
Moments later, she appeared, handbag in hand and dressed for the office--a soft pink silk blouse paired with a sleek pencil skirt, her hair falling in polished waves down her back. Even without makeup, there was an easy grace to her.   
  
Vincent gave her a quick look, then slipped into the car. ""Roberts Group,"" he instructed David.   
  
Vincent spent the entire drive fielding one business call after another, barely leaving a gap for conversation.   
  
Once they reached Roberts Group, Dayna slipped out of the car, her heels tapping softly as she made her way toward the front entrance.   
  
Vincent lingered for a moment, eyes following her silhouette until the glass doors closed behind her. Only then did he finally look away.   
  
From the driver's seat, David glanced back. ""Sir, Mrs. Clarke left her bag.""  
  
Vincent turned to find a delicate designer purse resting on the seat, forgotten in her haste.   
  
  
  
Chapter 5 Do You Want Me To Get Involved  
When Dayna arrived on the executive floor, Clara was waiting by the door, nerves showing in her posture.   
  
Clara's warning was quick and quiet. ""Tread lightly. Mr. Roberts's in a foul mood.""  
  
With a nod, Dayna straightened her shoulders and entered the office.   
  
""Dad--"" She didn't even get the word out before a magazine sailed across the room, the edge catching her cheek and leaving a thin sting behind.   
  
Glenn Roberts stood rigid behind his desk, eyes blazing. ""What is this, Dayna? Care to explain?""  
  
Vincent might have managed to scrub the story from the Internet overnight, but there was no calling back print. One of those magazines had landed right here, in Glenn's hands.   
  
A cold gleam passed through Dayna's gaze. ""If I told you Michael did this on purpose, that none of it was my fault, would you believe me?""  
  
""None of it was your fault?"" Glenn slammed a palm on the desk, pointing a finger straight at her. ""You're not just any employee. You're Roberts Group's director and head designer. You know exactly how Apex Entertainment's media works. If Michael stirs up trouble, the whole family suffers!""  
  
Her face stayed blank, voice steady. ""If you're worried about the Clarke family, don't be. Almost no one knows Vincent and I are married. His reputation is safe.""  
  
But Glenn refused to listen. ""You've kept Vincent at a distance for three years--just waiting for your old flame to show up so you could pick up where you left off? You have no idea how much you've let me down.""  
  
Dayna's hand tightened at her side, and her eyes--icy, silent--met his without wavering. There was no warmth in her expression, only a calm frost.   
  
For a moment, Glenn hesitated. In that look, she was the mirror image of her mother. His voice turned even sharper. ""You're going to apologize to Vincent. Remember, you don't just represent yourself--you carry the entire Roberts family.""  
  
A short, dry laugh slipped from Dayna's lips. All her life, that was all they saw--a bridge to the Clarke fortune, never a daughter.   
  
Glenn's tone grew heavier, words landing like weights. ""You're going to do what's needed. We have a massive branding campaign coming up, and Vincent's investment is crucial. Right now, your job is to keep him happy--whatever it takes.""  
  
Lifting her head, Dayna's voice cut through the tension. ""You're talking about the same campaign built on Mom's old sketches, right? The ones you trot out every time you need approval? Even after everything, you're still squeezing her for every last drop.""  
  
""Watch your mouth, Dayna!"" Glenn shouted, hand raised in sudden anger.   
  
Before his hand could fall, the door swung wide. The entire atmosphere shifted.   
  
Vincent appeared in the doorway, his expression impossible to read, but the air crackled with presence. He must have caught the tail end of their exchange.   
  
Glenn's fury vanished in an instant. His arm dropped, and a hasty smile flickered on his face. ""Vincent! I didn't expect you here today.""  
  
Dayna's gaze slid past her father, cold and unwavering.   
  
Vincent entered, flawless in his suit, one hand tucked in his pocket, the other holding her forgotten purse. His eyes passed over her with a brief, searching look.   
  
Glenn rushed to fill the silence. ""What a surprise. Please, have a seat. Dayna can bring you coffee.""  
  
""That's not necessary. I came to return her bag."" Vincent lifted it slightly, then added, ""I also wanted to take a look around while I'm here.""  
  
Despite the connection between the Roberts and the Clarke families, this was Vincent's first visit to Roberts Group.   
  
Glenn could barely contain his excitement, immediately shifting focus to business. ""About that proposal I mentioned--have you had a chance to review it?""  
  
Vincent loosened his tie, his voice composed and cool. ""I've had a packed schedule. I'll get to it when I'm able.""  
  
Glenn swallowed his eagerness and nodded, turning sharply to Dayna. ""Don't just stand there. Go on, give Vincent a tour.""  
  
Dayna turned away from her father without a second thought, walking straight out of the office.   
  
She made her way back to her workspace, hearing Vincent's footsteps behind her a moment later.   
  
Clara and Zayne stood nearby, lingering at the threshold.   
  
Fighting to keep her voice steady, Dayna accepted the purse from Vincent. ""I rushed out earlier and left it behind. Thanks for bringing it over.""  
  
Vincent's gaze lingered on the thin red mark marring her cheek--a silent acknowledgment of what had happened between her and her father.   
  
Slipping his hands into his pockets, he spoke up unexpectedly. ""Do you want me to get involved?""  
  
Dayna looked at him, thrown off by the question. ""What do you mean?""  
  
""Your father's branding project,"" he said, voice matter-of-fact. ""I haven't reviewed the details yet. But if you actually think it has merit, I'll take a look.""  
  
""Your father's branding project,"" he said, voice matter-of-fact. ""I haven't reviewed the details yet. But if you actually think it has merit, I'll take a look.""  
  
Her teeth pressed gently into her lower lip. ""Roberts Group only managed to stay relevant in luxury because of my mother's legacy. She was the creative force behind everything. For years, my father's cashed in on her name--selling her designs, pushing me to hand over my own work. I'm done letting him bleed her dry.""  
  
Meeting his eyes, she straightened her shoulders. ""I know Roberts Group made it this far with help from Clarke Group. But I'm sure I can turn things around myself. All I'm asking for is a little time.""  
  
The certainty in her voice made Vincent pause. A subtle nod, almost approving, passed over his face. ""Alright. I get it.""  
  
Relief washed over her features. She took a small step forward, meaning to thank him, but her foot snagged on the edge of the rug and she stumbled.   
  
Vincent reacted instantly, reaching out and steadying her with an arm around her waist.   
  
In an instant, the space between them vanished, and Dayna's pulse hammered so hard she felt dizzy.   
  
She realized she was flush against Vincent's ch\*\*t, the shape of her lips stamped in rose on his crisp white shirt.   
  
Heat crept up her neck as embarrassment swept over her. ""I... I didn't mean to. I just tripped.""  
  
Vincent looked down, eyes lingering on her blushing cheeks, then leaned in until his words tickled her ear. ""If you want to be close to me, you only have to ask. No need to stumble into me.""

The job hunt was rough, but I eventually landed a role I felt lucky to get. At first I was excited. I worked hard, learned fast, and got CPA. But over the last year, the environment has started to feel kind of toxic. It’s constant nitpicking and shifting expectations. I know I’ve improved since year one. My ability is stronger and I’m faster. Weirdly, I second-guess myself more now than I did when I was new. I think it was burnout. So I decided to change the environment. I’ve been mocking with chatgpt and beyz, and doing LinkedIn reach-outs and coffee chats. Then I had some interviews. The problem is the burnout hasn’t gone away during the search. I’m working all day, then prepping at night, then showing up to interviews already drained. My interview performance has been inconsistent, which makes me tired more.

they are not actually puerto rican,one of the partners(very small role in the company) is puerto rican,but the actual owner is american with mexican parents
they try to justify their price by saying it’s single origin and they pay extra to their farmers - LIES.the extra for farmers comes out of the tips for baristas,it’s a pooling system and there’s a reason they refuse to provide a breakdown of them to the baristas.its not single origin - they started selling coffee from colombia and other places but still don’t charge less.

have you ever been to a location and the barista is very annoying,trying to sell you more and sounding like a script?or maybe they asked you for a picture the 3rd time this week?
they’re all forced to do that and if they don’t get it consistently,they WILL be fired.all baristas are required 4 pictures of costumers,2 google reviews,1 coffee bag and to sell out of empanadas in every single shift.

the bags are not used because they’re biodegradable,it’s because they’re cheaper.also why they refuse to get cups for expresso,cortados or macchiatos.even though they charge $6 minimum for those,it’s still not enough to get the cup for it.

the “homemade” empanadas,cookies,banana bread? all bs,they buy it frozen and bake it.also,except for the empanadas,every single pastry is to be kept for days until they start getting moldy (i’m not kidding,cookies sometimes were kept for over a week and they were rock hard)

have you heard of the whiskey/rum infused roast? they are an extra $3 and baristas are told to not mention it to costumers (baristas are required a minimum $12 per sale) .theyre also not actually infused,they’re just covered in flavorings after being roasted (cinnamon,vanilla etc).

we have rats in every single location,cockroaches are a best friend at this point,and they only give you 15 minutes to clean up after closing before they stop paying you - they also don’t pay overtime ever (you’re expected to work for free,if you stop working they WILL dislike it and remember it ).and it’s usually one barista per shift,unless it’s at one of the huge stores (only 2 in the city).

the owner is also an awful person and doesn’t feel like you’re talking to a genuine human,he feels AI generated and is absolutely abusive to most of the staff (there’s a few that are protected and will never be fired for whatever reason,even if they’re basically useless)

you don’t get paid for training and you’re only trained for 1 day in the field before they leave you alone.the pina colada syrup is store bought and they mix it with coconut flakes.


there’s so much more but this is already a huge post.but seriously,the food is not safe to consume most of the time (no food thermometers in most locations either) and will cost you at least $6.the coffee is not cheap and also not good quality.they will not mention the upcharge for coffee beans,so just get regular if you do go.if you aren’t from NYC but you’ve seen the posts and want to visit,i’d recommend you go nearly anywhere else.",57,1767774201.0,nyc,12,0.9,False

1q69w9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Flashy-Simple-9099/comments/1q69w9q/sick_after_hot_yoga/,Sick after hot yoga,"Hello all!

I’m going to share a long story and I would love to hear from those with similar experiences or any suggestions. 

A week before Christmas, I did a hot yoga class (strength/conditioning). I’ve never done a heated class before, and haven’t been working out much due to busy finals season. Half way during the class, I started to feel faint so I went to the washroom and splashed myself with cold water and sat down for a bit. I then felt better and went back to continue the class. Looking back at it now, I should not have done that. I should also have prepared by drinking electrolytes, but all I had before class was a banana and coffee. A few hours go by, I’m extremely tired, I eat and have a shower. Then I start to feel really faint and rlly hot. I then threw up and my heart was racing. I also got rlly cold and shakey. (From what I’ve read, this can happen after hot yoga). This lasted a while, and my bp was high, so that night I went to the ER. The ER doc said my ecg, blood test, and urine was normal (though I checked my labs myself later and my potassium was slightly low). So I go home and the next two days I still don’t feel great. I would randomly get these faint episodes, where I would get really hot, feel faint, go run my hands under cold water, lay down, then feel really cold and shaky. My heart rate seemed not as high, but now I had chest pain (tightness and pressure), and threw up once more. I also rlly haven’t been eating these days, but was drinking electrolytes. I did not want to go back to the ER, so I called 811 and talked to a doctor on the phone. He could not pin point the issue, so told me to get Tums. The reason for this was because I did tell him that I constantly feel the need to burp and feel like there’s food stuck. I do have symptoms of reflux, like needing to take a deep breath, and pressure feeling in my chest, though these symptoms seemed to be much worse during this time. The tums did not help so I went to the ER the next morning, only to have, again, normal ecgs, chest X-ray, and blood tests. They also tested my bp while laying down and then standing. (Another little thing I had was my left middle finger tip would feel on and off numbness/tingling. Also really purple veins on my thumb muscles/hands after I’d shower. Also my gut was a mess this whole week). So ya, just went back home. Then I had one day where I felt completely normal. No faint episodes and my appetite was back. I thought I was better, until the next day. I was just getting ready to go out, then had the hot flash/faint episode again. After that I felt rlly intense reflux symptoms. I did not want to be alone and found that walking around the grocery store  with my mom helped. So bc of this  episode I made a doctors appointment for the next morning (Xmas eve). The first thing she said was… anxiety. Could I be anxious about not feeling well? Ya, but is that what’s causing this? I don’t think so. (I ended up getting l-theanine after this to help with stress).  She said I could be having vasovagal responses but she didn’t seem too impressed with that reasoning (bc I’m only 23, her words). I then told her about my possible gerd so she prescribed acid inhibitors to try out. On Christmas Day I was able to eat a small dinner and felt okay. Then the next day I got on a flight to see my bf for a week. I was completely fine  the entire week. Then now I’m back home, first day of class was yesterday. During the last few minutes of my last class, I felt a weird feeling. A bit nauseous and hot. I also tho felt hungry, so I went and sat down and ate the rest of my sandwich. Not feeling as bad as the week prior, but still worried. I drove home with the window down for cold air, then my gut was a mess again (diarrhea), and had chest pressure and feeling of food stuck (gerd symptoms). This has rlly thrown me off cause I thought I was better. 

This is an extremely long story but I didn’t want to leave anything out. Have I triggered some form of dysautomnia? Is it temporary autonomic dysfunction? Is this making my gerd worse? Do I even have gerd? Not really sure. I do have a halter monitor test in 2 weeks and will have a follow up appointment with my doctor. ",1,1767774079.0,u_Flashy-Simple-9099,0,1.0,False
