Adult coloring books might be exactly what you need. They're not just for kids anymore - these books are designed specifically for grown-ups who want to unwind without screens.

**Why Adult Coloring Books Work So Well**

When you sit down with colored pencils and a detailed page, something interesting happens. Your mind focuses on staying inside the lines and choosing colors. This simple activity helps push away worries about work, bills, or tomorrow's schedule. It's like meditation, but way more fun.

Coloring also keeps your hands busy. Instead of scrolling through your phone for the hundredth time, you're creating something. Many people find this helps them fall asleep easier too.

**What Makes a Good Coloring Book**

Not all coloring books are the same. Some have super tiny details that need sharp pencils and perfect lighting. Others have bigger spaces that work great when you're watching TV or listening to music.

Think about what sounds relaxing to you. Do you like flowers and nature scenes? Geometric patterns? Maybe animals or fantasy worlds? The subject matters less than picking something that makes you happy to look at.

Paper quality is important too. Thin pages mean markers will bleed through. Thicker paper lets you use whatever coloring tools you want without ruining the next page.

**Finding Your Perfect Match**

If you're new to this, start with books that have varied designs. That way you can try different styles without buying multiple books. Look for ones with perforated pages if you want to frame your favorites or give them as gifts.

You can check out a solid collection of options here: https://athomewave.com/adult-coloring-books. They've got different themes and difficulty levels all in one place.

**What You'll Actually Need**

The book is just the start. You'll want something to color with - colored pencils are the most popular because they're easy to control and don't bleed. Markers work too, but stick with fine-tip ones.

Good lighting helps a lot. Those tiny spaces are tough to see in dim light. Keep your supplies in one spot so everything's ready when you want a coloring session.

**Making It Part of Your Routine**

Set aside 20-30 minutes before bed. That's enough time to finish a section without staying up too late. Keep your coloring book on your nightstand or coffee table where you'll actually see it.

Some people color while listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Others prefer silence or calm music. There's no wrong way to do this - it's about what helps you relax.

**Where to Start Shopping**

Ready to give it a try? Browse through different styles and themes at https://athomewave.com/adult-coloring-books to find something that catches your eye. Most books are pretty affordable, so you can grab a couple different types without breaking the bank.

The best coloring book is the one you'll actually use. Pick designs that excite you, grab some pencils, and give yourself permission to just enjoy coloring again. Your quiet nights are about to get a whole lot more peaceful.",1,1764742842.0,UmmAmazon,0,1.0,False
1pcwrdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MutualFundSpendInvest/comments/1pcwrdb/i_spend_3_hours_finding_deals_to_save_500_then_i/,I spend 3 hours finding deals to save ₹500. Then I Swiggy ₹800 food without thinking. What's wrong with me?,"**Yesterday:**

**10 AM:** Spent 2 hours finding the best credit card for airport lounge access

* Compared 15 cards
* Read 47 reviews
* Built a spreadsheet
* Saved ₹3,000 annually

**2 PM:** Ordered lunch on Swiggy

* Saw ""₹150 off on ₹300"" offer
* Added ₹80 of food I didn't need to hit ₹300
* Spent ₹270 total (after discount)
* If I'd just eaten the ₹200 meal I wanted, I'd have saved ₹70

**6 PM:** Researched Amazon deals for 1 hour

* Found headphones for ₹2,400 (down from ₹3,200)
* Felt like a genius
* Saved ₹800!

**8 PM:** Too tired to cook

* Swiggy: ₹650
* Didn't even check for deals
* Just clicked ""Order""

**Net result for the day:**

* Saved: ₹800 (headphones) + ₹3,000/365 days = ₹808/day
* Wasted: ₹70 (fake Swiggy deal) + ₹400 (Swiggy vs cooking)
* **Actual savings: ₹338**

**But I spent 3+ hours ""optimizing.""**

That's ₹112/hour of ""savings."" I literally earn more than that at my job.

**The pattern I've noticed:**

**I'm OBSESSIVE about:**

* Credit card rewards (research for hours)
* Flight deal alerts (check daily)
* Cashback offers (never miss one)
* Amazon/Flipkart sales (set reminders)

**I'm CARELESS about:**

* Daily food delivery (just order)
* Impulse purchases (it's only ₹500)
* Subscriptions I don't use (₹3K/month gone)
* Uber vs Metro (₹200 difference, daily)

**The math is bonkers:**

My ""optimized"" big purchases save me: \~₹15K/year My ""careless"" small purchases cost me: \~₹60K/year

**Net: I'm LOSING ₹45K/year despite feeling like I'm ""good with money.""**

**Why do we do this?**

Is it because:

* Big purchases feel important (research is justified)
* Small purchases feel insignificant (₹200 doesn't matter)
* Deals feel like winning (dopamine hit)
* Routine spending is invisible (just life)

**Here's what I think the actual smart approach is:**

**DON'T optimize:**

* Big one-time purchases (they're rare, just buy what you need)
* Travel deals (time spent hunting < money saved)
* Credit card research (pick one good card, done)

**DO optimize:**

* Daily repeating expenses (food, transport, coffee)
* Subscriptions (audit monthly)
* Impulse purchases (48-hour rule)

**But this feels... backwards?**

Like, I ENJOY researching credit cards and finding travel deals. It's fun.

I DON'T enjoy tracking daily spending. It's boring.

But the boring thing would actually save me more money.

**Anyone else stuck in this trap?**

What daily expenses are silently draining you while you optimize things that don't matter?",1,1764742820.0,MutualFundSpendInvest,0,1.0,False
1pcwr61,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1pcwr61/unwanted_keepsake/,Unwanted Keepsake,"The summer heat beamed down on the asphalt as a 2015 Ford Mondeo Estate pulled into the driveway of a split-level style home with a sold sticker over the REMAX sign in the yard. Stevie got out of the car and stretched her stiff limbs. It had been a long drive, and she was ready to sit down and relax for the rest of the day.

Unfortunately, the boxes in the boot of the car beckoned to be taken inside and unpacked. Letting out a sigh, Stevie grabbed her keys and unlocked the front door before starting to bring in all the boxes.

Stevie moved out here to be closer to her aunt, Anica. After losing both of her parents, Stevie didn’t feel like being in her hometown anymore. There was nothing left for her in that small town. Moving out here would give her a fresh start. At least, Stevie hoped so. Placing down the last box in the living room, she shut the door and plopped down onto the couch.

The slight hum of the AC in the background began to lull her to sleep. It had been a long drive after all, and who knows when she would get another nap like this again? Stevie closed her eyes, falling asleep. Knocking on her front door made her jolt awake as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes. She stood up and walked over to the door, peeking through the peephole.

Standing in the automatic porch light was her aunt Anica, with a small box in her hands.

Why was she here so late? Usually, she would call to let her know she was coming over. Yet here she was, standing on her porch in the middle of the night. A bizarre smile on her face, Stevie slowly opened the door.

“Aunt Anica, what brings you here this late?” she asked, looking at the woman in front of her. Anica’s smile faltered for a bit before spreading back onto her lips. “I just couldn’t wait to give you this welcome gift.” She patted the box, shoving it into Stevie’s hands.

Fumbling with the box, she looked at her aunt, who had taken a step back. “Well…uh, thank you, but you didn’t have to,” Stevie mumbled. Anica let out a soft chuckle, continuing to back away. “Oh no, dear…thank you for taking it off my hands.” She watched the woman hurriedly walk down the driveway and into her waiting car. Stevie stood there dumbfounded as she glanced down at the box in her hands.

Why had Aunt Anica been so adamant about giving her this **gift**?

Whatever it was, Stevie guessed her aunt was afraid that she would misplace it. Not that Anica was the type to lose anything, considering how well-organized she was. What exactly had been pawned off on her? Shutting the door, Stevie walked over to the couch, sat on the arm of it, and carefully opened the box. Inside was your typical porcelain doll, except for a marking on its cheek that appeared to be a beauty mark or a tiny crack.

Sighing, she played with the curls before setting the doll and its box aside on the couch. Stevie would find a place for the doll the next day. After all, she had a lot of unpacking to do anyway, so it would not hurt to wait to display the gift. Glancing at the doll, Stevie closed the lid to its box. There was just something about this doll that made her uneasy, but she could not let it phase her.

The following day, as Stevie goes to make coffee, she lets out a surprised gasp, seeing the doll on the counter. She knew she had not left the doll there. Maybe she was so tired that she was seeing things. Right? At least, that is what she wanted to believe, anyway.

Picking up the doll, Stevie took it to the living room and placed it on the bookshelf.

She goes back to the kitchen and makes her coffee. Added her milk, sipping the divine liquid of the gods, and sighed happily. From her spot leaning against the counter, Stevie studied the doll with curiosity. Stevie knew that she had never sleptwalked before, so surely, she could not have moved the doll. Anica, her aunt, could not have come in during the night since she did not have a key.

The doll itself could not have moved on its own…

It was not one of those that could. The doll was made of porcelain, and its limbs were unbendable.

So, how was it able to move on its own? Finishing her coffee, she headed to her bedroom, took a well-deserved shower, and got dressed to go for a jog. It was an opportunity to get a look at the neighborhood she lived in. Hopefully, this would also help clear her head. Dolls did not move on their own.

It was around lunchtime when Stevie walked back in through the door. Her eyes went to the bookshelf where the doll was supposed to be. She was missing. Where was she now? Looking around the living room from top to bottom and even under the couch, she could not find her. Stevie stepped into the kitchen, hands placed on her hips. Raising her head, she looked up at the top of the fridge.

Had she placed the doll there? But she could have sworn she placed her on the bookshelf. Or maybe Stevie had not and put her on the fridge instead. After all, she did come in here to make her coffee. So, absent-mindedly, Stevie had placed her up there instead.

Shaking her head, she sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose with a thumb and index finger.

Stevie had never been forgetful before, but maybe the move was finally taking its toll on her.

Reaching up, she took the doll down from the fridge and placed it back on the bookshelf. Then, she began to unpack a few boxes. She put her book collection onto the shelf along with the doll, propping it up in place.

Stevie thought that if she put something around the doll and it moved on its own, she would be able to hear it. That was the plan anyway, and she hoped it would work. However, that night, when Stevie was sleeping, three loud thuds hitting the hardwood floor made her sit upright in bed, her heart thumping wildly, causing her ears to thrum.

The bed creaked as Stevie swung her legs over the edge and stood up, grabbing the baseball bat she kept by the bed. She slowly made her way out of the bedroom and down the stairs. Stevie squinted her eyes, peering into the living room. On the floor, her books were scattered around, with the doll nowhere to be seen. She perked up her ears and listened closely.

Stevie could hear the faint sound of something skittering around on the first floor. When something brushed past her legs and up the stairs, she screamed, losing her balance, and fell down the rest of the way, hitting her head at the bottom. Her vision went dark. When she woke up, Stevie had a sizable bump on her head and a swollen ankle. Had she been knocked out all night? She blearily looked around, squinting her eyes at the bright sunlight shining through the curtains.

Looking up at the stairs, she gasped, seeing the doll sitting there looking down at her. Stevie scooted backward, her back hitting the wall, wincing in pain at both her head and ankle. There was something up with this **doll** that her aunt Anica had given her. Pulling herself up, Stevie limped over to the doll, snatching it up, and carried it to a hall closet, where she placed it onto a top shelf, closing the door.

Stevie began her day by having a quick breakfast and tended to her injuries. As she sipped her coffee, she called a friend who was an expert in haunted and possessed objects. He may have answers to her questions. Picking up her phone, she called Eris, an expert in haunted objects. He had always warned her not to pick up anything old, or if it ever gave her a bad feeling.

She told him that her aunt, Anica, had given her this **doll** when she arrived in town. She seemed hesitant about accepting it. Eris said to her that without seeing it in person, there would be no one he would know for sure. She should still take precautions to protect herself. Stevie almost laughed at this until she remembered that the doll had tripped her, making her fall down the stairs.

Stevie could have died last night. She agreed and ended the call. Looking up from her phone, that doll was there sitting upright in the living room. Dropping her coffee cup, it shattered onto the hardwood floor. Stevie cursed as she moved around the mess to grab some paper towels to clean it up.

When she was done, Stevie placed the doll back into the closet, placing a chair under the knob.

To make sure the doll could not get out.

It wouldn’t be able to.

At the very least, it could help her sleep better tonight. Stevie went through the rest of her day. Trying to put the doll out of her mind and what happened last night.

Though her limping and throbbing head was an annoying reminder that it had happened, Stevie wished that she hadn’t accepted that doll from her aunt in the first place.

Later that night, she settled into bed. Her head had stopped hurting, but the throbbing in her ankle was still there. Stevie probably should have gone to the clinic near the house, but she was stubborn. Plus, she didn’t think that “*a doll tripped me last night”* would be a good reason to be seen. If it got worse, she would say she was moving furniture, as she had recently moved.

As Stevie drifted off to sleep, that was when the nightmares began. In this nightmare, she was being chased down a long corridor. Stevie was running and kept looking over her shoulder. Yet every time she tried to get a good look at what was behind her, the lights would go out. The figure would blend effortlessly into the darkness surrounding them, keeping its form a secret.

Stevie gasped awake, her heart hammering against her chest. As she shifted into a sitting position, she saw it. There, sitting on a footstool across from her, was the **doll**. Stevie slowly lay back down, pulling the covers up over her head. She squeezed her eyes tightly, pursing her lips together slowly as the lump in her throat. *“Please go away…”* she thought to herself.

In the morning, she found herself inside one of the many cafés that littered a downtown plaza, staring into her empty coffee cup. There were prominent dark circles under her eyes. Stevie honestly felt that her energy had been sapped from her. This had to do with the doll; there was no doubt about it. She needed to contact her aunt.

That woman had pawned the doll off on her, so she had to know something about it. There was no way Stevie was going to let Anica run away from this. She called her and set up a meeting location. When Anica saw her niece, she lowered her head in shame, the smile disappearing from her face. “I think you know what I’m here to talk to you about, Auntie.” Stevie gave a sideways smile, taking a seat across from her.

“M-my goodness Stevie…you look exhausted, are you no–“

“Cut the crap, Auntie…”

Ancia frowned and folded her hands in front of her. She began to tell her niece about where she found the doll. It was at an estate sale; the bank had bought an old house since it had gone unclaimed for years. A lot of the items they removed were still in good condition. When Anica’s eyes fell on that doll, she had to have it.

When she first brought it home, things were fine every day, but then they began to get misplaced, including the doll itself, which wasn’t always where Anica had left it. Then she began to have strange **accidents** happen in the house, like falling down the stairs, almost stepping on broken glass, and being electrocuted. Anica thought that she may have been hexed until the night she saw the doll scurry across the floor.

That was when she started losing sleep herself, and soon after, the nightmares. So, Anica packed up the doll and put it into the undercroft of the stairs. When she heard that Stevie was going to be moving into the same town, Anica knew what she had to do. Her aunt’s eyes teared up as she placed a hand on her niece’s hand, who pulled it away. “Who was running the estate sale where you got the doll?” Stevie cleared her throat, holding back a sob.

Anica dug through her purse and procured a card, placing it on the table. Stevie stood, took it, and went on her way. Her aunt Ancia had pawned the doll off on her to save her skin. That way, she wouldn’t have sleepless nights, nightmares, or accidents. Instead, she would rather it happen to someone else.

Even if it meant that it was someone close to her…

Stevie arrived at the address on the business card. An older man was setting out items for display at the estate sale for the day. Their eyes met, and he gave her a friendly smile and a wave. She took out her cell phone, showed him a picture of the doll, and asked if he had seen it before. His smile faltered into a frown. “Where did you get that doll?” he seemed uneasy, and he wiped his hands on his pants.

“My aunt bought it here,” Stevie motioned to the building.

The man shook his head. “It wasn’t supposed to be sold,”  he pointed at the picture.

“That **doll** is cursed…”

According to the owner of the estate sale, a medium was supposed to pick up the doll. He told his workers not to sell it, and somehow, it ended up on display with the rest of the dolls.

“If you have it…” he paused, clearing his throat.

“Give it to the medium and get yourself cleansed.”

She paled, putting her phone away, and wondered what kind of curse was inhabiting the doll, but that was a question she would have to ask the medium herself.

Stevie thanked him for the information and headed home to get the doll. She was glad to be getting rid of it. When she entered her home, however, the air felt stifling even with the AC on. The walls themselves creaked as she walked inside, seeming to pull in towards her.

“Where the hell are you…” Stevie whispered aloud to herself, looking around for the doll.

Her bedroom door creaked open from upstairs, and whispers flowed down into the living room. She knew it was trying to lure her up there and that her problem wouldn’t go away until she got this doll out of her house. Grabbing the baseball bat, Stevie left downstairs, heading upstairs a step at a time. Standing in the hallway, she had a full view of her bedroom. There, on the bed, sat the doll.

However, its appearance had changed…

Its clothing was darkened and stained with something that Stevie could only assume was old blood.

The once-pristine porcelain face was cracked, and from the cracks, a black, swirling mist spewed forth.

This thing was pure evil, and the bat she carried would not be enough to stop it.

Stevie leaned her bat against the wall and grabbed a pillowcase from the hall closet. Opening it up, she pulled it down over the doll, scooped it up, and closed the end. Going down the stairs with it, the doll thrashed about in the pillowcase in her hands. Just like her friend had told her, Stevie needed to get this doll to a medium. She was out the door and in her car with the doll in a tied-up pillow, sitting in the passenger seat.

Stevie found the medium closet and knocked on the door. The doll in her arms had gone still.

A woman opened the door, giving her a once-over before beckoning her inside. Stevie placed the doll where the medium told her to, and she began her work. The doll was sealed inside a special type of wooden box, and talismans were placed on the outside. When the medium approached Stevie again, it was to put her through a series of steps in a cleansing ritual. She was told to leave the doll in her care and that she would ensure it was disposed of.

Stevie’s mind was at ease, at least for now.

One night, Stevie came in from running an errand for a late-night snack. She was gathering up her bags to head inside. When she had spotted something on her front steps, it was a wooden box with talismans placed all over it. All the seams were filled in with black wax.

Now the box was open, the lid lying off to the side.

Stevie knew that the doll was free, and she knew that it was hiding.

1. Ang Panindahan 
🗓️: Dec 2024  📍: Balay Sueño
🗓️: Jun 2025  📍: Joe III garden
	•	First pop-up dates back to december of 2024 at Balay Sueño in Jaro (sunday bake night). 
	•	Where I first encountered Lilac & Peony, a now well/established flower cart present in almost every weekend market. 
	•	Had a reasonable amount of merchants. Bringing hiraya to iloilo was a great strategy to attract customers. 
	•	Had a good selection of food and cafe kiosks too. 
	•	My first time buying thrift from a weekend market here in ilo since the prices were actually reasonable and pang thrift gid.
	•	2nd market was at Joe III garden in Villa. The event was bigger and catered more  merchants. Beachside location was refreshing for summer and they added yoga classes. 
	•	Had a wide selection of food kiosks. You could do everything the whole afternoon and would not get hungry because every meal was available (snacks, lunch, coffee)
	•	This weekend market is an intentional and well-curated event. It’s something you will miss and definitely look forward to the next time. 

	2.	Summersault
🗓️: April 2025📍: Avida Towers
🗓️: Oct 2025 📍: Waterfront
	•	Location was able to cater the crowd. The venue made the event feel a bit more exclusive compared to other pop ups
	•	Had fewer merchants compared to other markets and some were exclusive to that event.
	•	Where I first tried studiobelle (photobooth). 
	•	Their most recent event at Waterfront was a great one too! Love how they chose a nice riverside venue. Ppl will never not fall for an instagrammable loc lol! 
	•	Parking was packed but the guards were abtik and they were super patient naman to guide newcomers on whr to park
	•	Love the merchants they curated; will name a few that i loved: Forkyeah, the crepe cart, si manong na ga sell taho, dirty ice cream cart 
	•	This is the only market that has entrance fee but they say it’s for charity. I think it would help for their brand if they showed the ppl their progress in these charities in order to build a stronger community since I’ve heard damo ga reklamo na they’re the only market that has entrance fee.

	3.	Trendtitas
🗓️: Too many dates to mention na, but their biggest and longest is the upcoming christmas bazaar this Dec 11-15, 2025
	•	They have the most in merchant lineup 
	•	Venue accommodates the amount of ppl visiting, however parking at the northgrove is such a hassle and the event causes terrible traffic in molo
	•	The wide selection and variety of merchants is good but a lot of my friends and ppl we know get tired of seeing “thrift” merchants that aren’t thrift at all. Prices are waaay too expensive to be thrift. And these shops become redundant in one wknd market event.
	•	This wknd market has the most bearing among the others mainly because their marketing is really good, they hold events more frequently, and the set up in each event has its own unique identity apart from it being one of the first few markets in ilo. Ilonggos love familiarity and trendtitas brought some merchants that are now staples in every market into light.

	4.	Jungle 5000
🗓️: Sept 2025 (Upcoming christmas market this weekend - Dec 5-7) 📍: Monkey grounds; Concrete bldg
	•	Honestly my recent fave because of the venue. It has great potential because the venue allows for a unique experience. It’s also quite accessible since ara lang sa diversion. I enjoy the venue so much because indoors sya but sometimes init lang gd and kulang ila fans. 
	•	I think their first event started off really well. The concept of a jungle bldg has built its own community aside sa monkey grounds enjoyers hahaha. I think Gen Z LOVED the renovation of the bldg and its whole mysterious,edgy feel. Plus ka fun na may 2nd floor! I was impressed with how much seating they were able to provide (something that a lot of markets lack). 
      •     They also brought a lot of new merchants. E.g: live photo/video booth, additional local coffee brands like bstrd, a couple more of photobooths, and a lot of food brands too 
      •     They provide good restrooms
      •     Love the designated area for buskers and live music
	•	The venue also holds other weekend market brands like the most recent: Momentum.

	5.	Sala wknd market
🗓️: Sept 2025 📍: Clearstory, Westwoods
	•	Love the venue of this market. The only con: it was too small to accommodate the crowd that wanted to visit.
	•	The way the owners advertise this market is so exclusive and classy.
	•	Love that they prepared for it and used their connections fr mnl to bring some kiosks there to ilo. 
	•	They also held a brand launching of a nice local perfume brand on the first day

As a house warming gift, I’m making a friend a coffee table book, with beautiful animals and scenic nature photos. It’ll have elegant and classy fonts. All the information you’d read though is a collection of random animal facts we’ve shared with each other over our college years. We’ve been roommates for years and would randomly drop random not well known animal facts with each other, and would like to continue that to some extent as we move on in life. 

Examples of things we’d share:
- although roosters have cloaca’s they can be castrated. Along with a simple step by step break down of how. 
- the Argentinian lake duck has the longest penis vs body size. Measuring up to 43cm, making it the same length as the ducks body plus head length. It is corkscrew shaped and a brushed tipped end to “brush” compatible sperm out of mates. It can also be used to “lasso” or hold down the female if she tries to escape during copulation. 
- a list of facts about horses vs mules vs donkeys vs hinnies and how to identify them. 

The thing is we only have so many of these written down since we only recently started doing that. So I need some help with page filling. Any obscure, absolutely unhinged, or fascinating animal facts you have would be much appreciated! 

Not just things like “swans mate for life,” more things that cause a reaction, aren’t well known, or you find utterly fascinating would be a huge help.

I was raised by my grandparents most of my life so have naturally have a closer relationship with my grandparents . 

I have one sister who's only a year older than me, she's very close with my mom. It constantly feels like they're in some club and I'm on the outside looking in. She bullied me extensively growing up - for how I looked, how I presented, everything. When I was 16 she outed me to my family after she found out about my first girlfriend by stealing my phone and going through it. I guess there's just part of me that feels like deep down feels like my mom loves my sister more because she's straight, is traditionally feminine, etc. It's just something I internalized growing up...if I wasn't this way, my mom would give me the same attention she does my sister and actually want that type of relationship. Like if I just performed femininity more and played the perfect daughter role, things would change. Luckily im an adult now and obviously realize that I can't change who I am. 

Today I was over at my mom's, my sister showed up with my aunt and invited my mom to coffee/lunch. I guess I assumed I was invited too, so I started putting on my coat and my sister says ""I didn't realize you were inviting yourself, we just wanted to go with mom"" and my aunt was with them so it's not like it was 1 on 1 time I was inserting myself in. Of course my feelings were visibly hurt, my mom was standing right there and said nothing.

I ended up just driving two hours home (planned on spending rhe night) while they were gone. My mom called me, surprised I left and I told her that my feelings were really hurt. She called me dramatic, self absorbed and that I make everything about me, and said I take everything too personal. 

At the end of the call, she straight up said that she's always been closer with my sister because ""she's just someone I can relate to, it's hard having a daughter that you have nothing in common with, and doesn't want to act like a daughter. Imagine having a teenager that you can't go shopping or get a manicure with, I've just never known how I can connect with you. Everyone told me you'd grow out of it, but you didn't, so I'm sorry. I tried but I just had an easier time connecting with your sister, who I got to do prom dress shopping with and give her boy advice."" 

It just fucking hurts. To be almost 30 and feeling like I will never be loved as much as my sister, or have a spot at the table. 

Any advice for coping with this stuff? I'm in therapy, but it's still hard. I live in Boston which is incredibly progressive (and gay), and feel like 99% of my queer friends have incredibly accepting family so it's hard talking about stuff like this with them.

1pcwb10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pcwb10/what_the_hell_is_wrong_with_my_parents/,What the hell is wrong with my parents???,"I’m honestly exhausted. I love my parents, sure, fine, whatever, but I’m done. I think I’ve been bottling things up for way too long, and now everything is spilling out at once. This whole week has been overwhelming, and I hadn’t prepared for my exam properly. I’ve never skipped an exam in my life, but last night I pulled an all nighter out of pure desperation. I don’t even like coffee, but I dry swallowed those damn sachets (3 sachets, 1 gram each) just to stay awake.  
I studied fine until around 4 to 5 a.m, when my brain basically short circuited and I crashed. Slept an hour, woke up half alive, still stressed out of my mind. Before even telling my parents I was skipping the exam, I spiraled for a whole hour trying to figure out HOW to say it (I had to roleplay this with my plushies and had my script ready). I already knew how they’d react, and honestly I was scared that they'll kill me, over something this small. That’s the kind of pressure I’ve grown up with.  
So yeah I skipped today’s exam. ONE exam. Not the end of the world. There’s another one later with the exact same syllabus, and it’s way more important. I knew forcing myself today would screw me up for days. So When I told my mom, she immediately lashed out.  
“Go give your exam. We don’t scold you anyway.” (not that I get bad grades)  
Which is hilarious because the silent treatment they give is so much worse than yelling, but okay.  
I tried explaining calmly that there are mock tests, that missing one won’t destroy my future. She didn’t listen. She just shut me down. Then she dropped the one thing that always sets me off,  
“Your father will be angry.”   
That whole “what will people think” mentality? I get triggered by it. I’ve told her so many times not to use it on me. I genuinely don’t care about random people’s opinions, especially when it’s used as a weapon.   
And my dad? He barely speaks to me. Our entire script is “good morning,” “bye,” and “good night,” + the hugs I initiate even though I’m pretty sure he tolerates them more than he enjoys them because I’m persistent and small. They raised me to be independent and manage everything alone, and somehow managed to emotionally neglect me at the same time.   
They think giving things = love. It doesn’t. I don’t feel appreciated or respected. My dad praises me to other people but never to my face. I’ve won medals and only found out he bragged about them because someone else told me. It stings in a weird way.  
They’re “free” with me in the sense that they let me do whatever I want and sometimes so free it feels like they don’t care at all. But then suddenly they want to control something tiny, like this one exam, and it just makes everything ten times worse.   
I’m 18. I’m trying to figure my life out. Instead I’m dealing with a silent dad and a mom whose favorite move is the emotional guilt-trip, “you don’t love me,” “you’re always angry”, bro, like please NOOOO. And the funny thing is, I’m not even hateful or angry by nature. If you saw me out with my friends or cousins, you’d think I’m a completely different person, lighter, louder, actually myself.  
And yeah, I get jealous watching my friends casually talk with their dads, laughing like it’s nothing. Mine talks normally with my mom and brother, but with me? Zero. It makes me feel invisible, and I am damn sure that I am not broken.   
I skipped one exam, and somehow it turned into drama about respect, disappointment, and imaginary consequences. This relationship with them is eating me alive. I’m tired. I need out. I need a life that doesn’t drain me every single day.  
I don’t need pity.  
I need ways to stay sane.  
I’m running on fumes.  
All I want is to get into the college of my dreams, which is still 6 to 7 months away. I just need to survive until then.

figured i'd share some parking tips for the dvorak new world symphony on 12/04. parking downtown for an 11:00 am weekday show is a whole different beast than evening concerts because you're fighting all the regular business and commuter traffic. you need a plan, honestly.  
  
my absolute best insider tip is to check out Prked. this is an app for renting private driveways or empty spots in apartment building garages, usually in the loring park area right next to orchestra hall . it is way cheaper than the major ramps, you skip all the main ramp traffic lines, and it's usually just a short walk. it’s the best way to dodge the headache.  
  
if you prefer a ramp, the official one everyone uses is the skyway-connected 11th and marquette ramp . it's the most convenient for sure. just remember to keep your parking ticket with you once you pull it, because you need to scan it to get back in from the street level door . expect to pay $15-$20 here for an event stay .  
  
to save a few bucks on a ramp spot, check apps like spothero \*before\* you leave. you can often pre-book a spot at the nearby convention center lot for around $5.99 (about a 4 minute walk) or the 11th street underground garage for around $9.99, which is a significant saving over the drive-up rates . getting a guaranteed, prepaid spot cuts down on stress big time.  
  
valet is an option on 11th street. for the morning ""coffee concert"" it's available from 9:30 am to 1:30 pm . if you pre-order it online, it's $23, but if you just drive up, it's $28, and they don't guarantee a spot if you just drive up . for a mid-day show, valet is definitely the fastest way in and out.  
  
street parking is available, but you need to be super careful. you absolutely must use the minneapolis parking app to check the rules and max time for any meter you find . since it's a weekday, all meters will be enforced. look for spots near loring park, but remember the strict rules like not parking within 20 feet of any intersection . a ticket is not a fun souvenir.  
  
since it’s an 11:00 am weekday show, you'll be hitting the downtown area right after peak morning rush hour, so the streets are still going to be busy . try to arrive and be parked by 10:30 am to give yourself a relaxed 30 minutes to get to your seat, grab a coffee, and beat the final rush of concert goers. hope this helps, and enjoy the show!",1,1764741204.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1pcw9ti,https://i.redd.it/dqv7eq8ghx4g1.jpeg,What is this exactly called and how can I maximize its use for skincare?,"Hi!

So recently I discovered while bathing my ferret with oatmeal, that it releases a creamy texture that leaves a soothing feeling on the skin, then I read that oatmeal water is good for people with skin conditions such as eczema. Counterproductive with people with nickel allergy, but so far I’ve read that to be the only warning.

So, I just made another batch putting a cup of oats in a sock and soaking it in lukewarm water for 20 minutes and im straining this “cream / butter” like substance with my hands. 

I wonder, what’s the best way to store this and what are the best complements to add for our skincare? 

I don’t know if the butter like texture will dry so I thought of maybe adding honey or coconut oil to keep it moist (?) and perhaps adding coffee grounds for a light exfoliation (?)

These cups were from a specific brand, I later saw them again at Loft in Shibuya, but unfortunately didn’t buy them right away. The price was round about 6000¥.
Now I’m back home and searching the entire internet, but I can’t find them because I don’t remember the brand name.

#  LinkedIn Group Members to Google Sheets (Premium/Verified)

Just finished building a workflow that's been a game-changer for my LinkedIn lead gen strategy, and wanted to share it with you all.

# 🎯 The Problem

I'm part of several LinkedIn groups with thousands of members, but manually finding the ""quality"" leads (Premium subscribers and Verified profiles) was eating up hours of my time. These are typically decision-makers, founders, and serious professionals - exactly who I want to connect with.

# 💡 The Solution

Built an n8n workflow that:

1. **Extracts all members** from any LinkedIn group via API
2. **Auto-filters** for Premium OR Verified members only
3. **Handles pagination** automatically (even for groups with 10k+ members)
4. **Exports everything** to Google Sheets with full profile data

So recently I discovered while bathing my ferret with oatmeal, that it releases a creamy texture that leaves a soothing feeling on the skin, then I read that oatmeal water is good for people with skin conditions such as eczema. Counterproductive with people with nickel allergy, but so far I’ve read that to be the only warning.

So, I just made another batch putting a cup of oats in a sock and soaking it in lukewarm water for 20 minutes and im straining this “cream / butter” like substance with my hands. 

I wonder, what’s the best way to store this and what are the best complements to add for our skincare? 

I don’t know if the butter like texture will dry so I thought of maybe adding honey or coconut oil to keep it moist (?) and perhaps adding coffee grounds for a light exfoliation (?)

1pcw5w9,https://i.redd.it/mrwt38ndgx4g1.jpeg,After Two years got my home R&D setup - Project வேர் (VeR - Root),"It all started a couple of years back when I attended my first specialty coffee seminar. Since then, I’ve always wanted a space of my own to work, experiment and learn more about coffee.
It took me two tough years to put this setup together—lots of mistakes, lots of learning, and no regrets.
What is Project VeR?
VeR (வேர் ) means “root” in Tamil. That idea of “root” is our philosophy: build a solid foundation, understand what you’re doing, and stay deeply connected to the process. For us, that’s everything from choosing equipment to dialing in extractions to how coffee connects with architecture and design.
This R&D space is where I’ll be testing, learning, and documenting the journey. I’ll share progress, experiments and mistakes with the community as things evolve.

I’d love to hear from you—what experiments or topics would you like to see? Any advice for someone just starting out on this kind of journey?

1pcw4dh,https://i.redd.it/bx02ou5zfx4g1.jpeg,How to fix echo in a 13ft-wide basement karaoke area? Do I need acoustic treatment?,"Hi everyone,

I’m setting up a small karaoke/vocal practice area in my basement and could use some advice on acoustic treatment.

The blueprint says 16 ft wide, but the stairs/closet take about 3 ft, so my usable width is only 13 ft (~4m).

Right now the room is mostly empty except for my home gym on one side, and even normal talking already has noticeable echo.

My planned setup:
	•	TV + JBL 308P on the front wall
	•	Singing area between sofa and coffee table (also with a carpet)
	•	Open home gym area on the right side

Questions:
	1.	With a narrow 13ft room, how much acoustic panel do I actually need?
	2.	Should I treat the front wall (behind speaker), or back wall (above sofa) or also the side walls?
	3.	Are diffusers worth it for a small karaoke room?
	4.	Do I need bass traps if my main issue is echo, not bass buildup?

I am attaching my layout above.

Not aiming for studio quality — just want less echo and a more comfortable space for singing.

Idk if it’s in my head but  in 99.9 % of friendships in my two decades of living their efforts didn’t contradict my belief much. It was hard to believe when sometimes being referred to as a friend or close friend  cause of not making plans or txting it all and always fell on me. Cause it would end up feeling like I didn’t have anyone at the end of the day because unless I went out of my way it was silent I felt like someone chasing something. 

like in person we be vibing .. why do I get in friendships where only I communicate, make plans it would always start out that way and end that way I’m not sure if it’s my personality cause ppl are okay to hangout but just never think of me or want me outside of that..? Like I don’t understand ik this wouldn’t bother someone else but for me  it isn’t my version of desired friendship or what I expect. Like why can everyone else manage to have a Bare minimum friendship mine would almost act like I didn’t exist  if I wasn’t there psychically I don’t wanna feel bogged down but it makes me feel like I am not enough that my personality needs to be stronger and I want to run an experiment and act different and see if it gets me friends but then I wouldn’t want that cause then I wouldn’t  have friends who like me I feel like I  get up and try again through my stages of life but fail I feel like I’m part of a small percentile 

friends I had  were nice but I just djdnt see any genuine care come out or like the movie type of friendship that I always longed for  like someone that Ik deeply cares about me  just randomly is like wanna go shopping or I saw this and thought h would like it  some of the friends I had were  not as loud but then others were so it’s hard to tell what I’m doing wrong or if I’m picking the wrong ppl over and over again and it has to do with thier personality but then idk if they just met someone they wanted dk what it is but I hate it and I just want to be able to live true friendship in my life just one time like a hey wanna grab coffee it’s been long I miss u it’s also like they were always ok to just live without me.

1pcw471,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1pcw471/his_cheating_with_his_therapist/,His cheating with his therapist..?,"I suspect he is a serial cheater. That he is opportunistic, validation seeking, and in it for the thrill. He enjoys lying and engaging in brazen acts without being caught, whilst putting himself into situations where he could be. The reason I think this is because I believe I both overheard him cheating on a trip, and also witnessed him going down an alleyway with someone near where he volunteers. Overall, however, I suspect him of cheating for many more reasons. Most of my reasons for fairly normal like him being glued to his phone, spending long periods of time in the bathroom on it, being mean to me and distant. 

He has argued with me seemingly to be able to leave the room. He has shown more/less interest in sex and did new things he didn't do before, or since. He's disappeared and/ditched me in public claiming to have lost me. He had scratches on his back in hard to reach areas, which he said he caused. He has stayed up all night on his phone or laptop, sleeping all day, not wanting to spend any time with me. He's become more gaurded with his phone at times, not wanting me on it. He has done a lot more than that, often at the same time, and every time he was acting shady he questioned and accused me of cheating. 

A year ago he started another counseling course having previously done one a few years back. A lot of questionable things have happened in regards to that, and the women in the class. He is diagnosed with BPD and went to DBT a few times before stopping, and denying for years that he has BPD. It wasn't until the start of this year, when I wanted to leave, that he acknowledged he likely has BPD and said he'd go to therapy. The promise of change that I'd heard many times. He tried to get into DBT but couldn't. He looked for a therapist who specializes in it. He seemed to find a few and liked one in particular. Then he found another and changed his mind. 

This was right about the time his class made personal therapy mandatory meaning he had to go. He said the other therapist was too far away and this one was better. Even though he said he needed to see if she was a good fit, he seemed to automatically know she would be. I tend to go with him to many of the places he goes to, including his class on Tuesdays, but he arranged to do therapy on the same day. He said it was for convenience sake as they're not too far away from each other, and he won't have to drive up twice a week. He said he'd probably switch it around sometimes, and go on a different day. He had three hours or so to kill before his class after his therapy. 

He said it would be weird for me to come because he has to park at her house. She does therapy in her garage. He did as I expected he would do, as he's done with others, and lied about things she said and also threatened me with her during arguments. This was after he went to a few therapy sessions. At the same time he did a few things I found a bit suspicious. He went to a park near her house for an hour or so, and said he called his grandmother. Another time, when he was supposed to come right back, he stopped in a town he passes through. He sat in a parking lot for a while. 

He gave contradictory reasons for why he did this. This is the town where I witnessed him go down the alley with someone. It's where they live. Also where he volunteers though he hasn't volunteered in a long time, not consistently. He stopped doing so after I was onto him, I think. One of the last times he went alone he was supposed to call me and he didn't, and said he forgot. He sat at the same park for over an hour. He had offered to video call me knowing I believed he might be with someone. He later slipped up and said something about the person hiding, and claimed I said they could do that when I never did. 

I asked if there was a coffee shop or somewhere near his therapy I could go to, and wait inside, and he said no. There was one only two minutes away from his therapists house. When I asked if I could go with him, and he could drop me there, he seemed reluctant. He said that he could park there and walk to her house, which he said he said was because he didn't think I'd want to sit in the coffee shop. I went with him and he decided to go to her house. He reversed in because I found the situation awkward. He took the car key but quickly ran it out to me, and said she told him to, because it was cold outside. 

After his session, he said she made recommendations for coffee shops in the town, aware that we were going to get coffee. And I didn't know that therapists did this sort of thing, engaging in what sounds like small talk. It's a running joke where I speak down to him. It's playful teasing, with a bit of flirtatious undetones, though I don't know if he's ever been aware of that since he doesn't flirt with me or seem interested. I made a joke asking if I asked for his opinion, and saying that I didn't, to something he said. He said he was sorry and he'd shut up. He then said his therapist also tells him to shut up. I found it weird that he involved her in this. 

He said it was meant to be funny that two women tell him that. It was this last time he went, yesterday, that was rather strange. He got money out and received all 5s and seemed bothered by this, overly so. He put it into a brown envelope to give her. He came out 10mins late. I asked why that was he said he was learning techniques but didn't elaborate. Later on he told me about a technique he learned. Something he said she created called the bubble (she didn't create it) You imagine a place inside of a bubble and put things into it. He said when he opened his eyes the colors in the room were different. He laughed as he told me about it, and almost seemed hesitant to, when he was the one who mentioned it. 

I asked a while later what other techniques he learned. He said that was it and  it was done during the last 15mins. I asked what else happened, or was discussed, during the session. He paused and gave a generic, vague response, like anxiety and his class. He acted like he couldn't remember. This is odd considering before this he was eager to share what they discussed with me, even when I didn't necessarily want to know about it. He told me the last time they talked about his dad, and the abuse he endured from him growing up. Perhaps he talked about something he doesn't want to share but he could tell me that. 

Instead, he had no real answer, and he seemed nervous like before. He also seemed nervous when he was going there, and said that he was. He kind of snapped at me over it actually. When I said he was acting different. The thing is he has to log his sessions for his class, and she has to sign it. I believe that he is with a therapist. But I have no idea if something is going on, though it seems to be the case. It could be a number of things. It could be transference which is pretty common. He has shown less interest in me sexually when he already shows little interest. He's started arguements with me recently. 

He told me the other day how much he appreciates me and was all sappy. This was unusual. I believe, even if nothing is going on with the therapist, that cheating and inappropriate behavior is occuring elsewhere. He hides behind his counseling training, and the absurdity of someone studying that cheating, especially with a fellow classmate. He has stopped doing things he knows raise alarm bells, but not because he cares about how I feel. He stopped staying up all night. He stopped leaving the room. And so now he does other things like sit at a park or in a parking lot. ",2,1764740628.0,Infidelity,2,1.0,False

It's going to be quite long as I needed to get all of these thoughts out of my head. If someone reads everything please can you give me your advice on this situation. 

So I met my girlfriend on an dating app at the beginning of the year and from the first date the connection was there. I broke it off yesterday after 10 months last weekend but I'm second guessing myself really hard right now and would like external opinions please.

I'm not sure if I've overacted or not by breaking things up but there's been some issues related to her lying a few times in the relationship and I'm not sure if it's something that is as bad as I imagine it to be in my mind. Right now I'm fuckim heartbroken like it just hurts like it's the first time ever again (and I'm in my early thirties, same as her) and I'm starting to doubt myself  and my decision. For context I was cheated on by my ex with her ex a couple of years ago and that left a bit of trust issues on my side. That's why I want an external opinion on this to know if I'm overacting or not as I don't fully trust my judgment. There's always 2 sides of the same story but I'll try to be as objective as possible.

The first lie was rather small and was when she went climbing with a long term male friend 2 months into the relationship. I asked some questions about him because I had seen all of her close friends except him at that time. They're all in the same friend group. She mentions in passing that him and another friend (a girl) offered her flowers for her last birthday so I asked if the guy was maybe into her because I never met him. She said no and went to see him and then came back. All good until a week later she tells me that actually he asked her out when she broke up with her ex and she refused. But she said that technically she told me the truth because he wasn't into her anymore when I asked the question and that she didn't want to worry me over nothing. I then saw him a few weeks later and everything is fine he's a cool guy but i felt uneasy about this situation. 

The second lie was when we were going back to my place about a month later and she ordered an Uber from her phone and I saw an address on it (she was next to me when ordering) so I asked her about it and she said it was her ex's place. For context, one month into the relationship, her ex proposed to give her work (they both work remotely on their laptop) as she was in between jobs and needed money for a family issue (not directly relevant but it's something serious and important). I was away during that time and was feeling super weird about it (especially considering my past relationship before her where my ex cheated with her ex..) but told her it's okay since I get it and you guys can just go to a cafe so he can explain the project and handover the  company laptop etc. She called me after and told me they worked from a cafe and reassures me and things were good. Well a month later when I pressured her about the Uber I saw trip i actually learned that she went to work at his place but no cheating happened (I know this for a fact now - more info on this later).

Fast forward 7 months later and everything was going great. I could easily picture a us in a growing old together kind of life. Things were getting more and more serious and i was planning for me to meet her family soon. Last weekend we came back at night. We had gone for some drinks and had an amazing time. When we come back she falls asleep and I saw her phone on the couch. She never hid it so I never thought or wanted to check it. I still feel terrible about this and don't have any excuses but I don't know I think being a bit drunk (it had been a while) made me a bit impulsive and I wanted to know for sure so I checked the convo with her ex and although he tried to pursued her after they had met, she told him that she was in a happy relationship now and that it was already over since they broke up for the first time etc. It was actually okay.

i was actually relieved but then I saw a photo of another guy and then checked her conversation with him. Turned out it was a guy she had a one night stand with while traveling just 3 days before we became exclusive (1.5 month into the dating phase just before we got together). She actually called me that night so I had no idea she did this after calling me so it hurt a bit as I thought she was taking things slow to be sure about me as she said she needed some time to be intimate again with someone after her past relationship. I had actually invited her to my place after we kissed for the first time in the dating phase but she said she'd rather wait. When we had sex and finally became exclusive she said that she was really happy we had waited... i was seeing someone too during the dating phase but broke things off a bit after when we had our first kiss 2 weeks prior when I could sense that it was leading to something. I guess we were not together so it's fine (?). 

Anyway, the main issue is that they kept talking on and off after we became official and she told him he should come visit the city where we live (huge touristic city that every one know of) and was planning to see him at a coffee placee. There's nothing too crazy in the conversion but it felt a bit flirty without being over the top flirty. Not sure how to describe it.

But I felt weird about her still talking to a one night stand 2 month in the relationship. The other guy actually thought she was still single until she started to say that they will meet as friends only a week before he was supposed to travel and then a few days before he was supposed to arrive she said that she can't meet him because her boyfriend ""doesn't want her to meet him"" because they've been intimate. This is true in theory but I never knew about his existence until a few days ago. I just said that when we were discussing boundaries that I would not feel comfortable with her meeting a past ons one on one but never said anything specific about her meeting this guy in particular since I didn't know about the whole story anyway.

What's a bit weird is that this guy was not even her friend and she was still talking to him and planning to see him at some point. I don't understand the risk being taken for someone she doesn't even know and didn't want to meet. And then why explaining herself to him?

So I told her that I knew about this guy but didn't mention seeing the texts. I asked if they only spent one night together and she said yes and that it was only one night and didn't mean anything as she wanted to just have a bit of fun before starting what she was feeling was going to be a serious relationship with me. But it turned out it was one night and the whole next day juding by the texts. Like they spent the whole day together and something he wrote make me believe they didn't just have sex once. So it was another lie and this one was only a few days ago.

I broke up with her. She said she didn't cheat since to her this was not  what she would considered cheating. I guess this is a grey area. But she said that she's really sorry she lied to me and that I don't deserve to be lied to. I think the main issue is this and I want to trust her again but I don't know if that's possible or even worth it after all this? She seemed to really understand what the problem was and doesn't really know why she lied like that. now I don't know what to do. Should I try to give her a new chance? Is there a way for me 
 to trust again? I would love to have some advice please.",4,1764740470.0,survivinginfidelity,8,1.0,False

At Dr. Phil DDS, every smile is treated like a masterpiece. With years of expertise and the latest in dental technology, Dr. Phil and his team provide customized whitening treatments that deliver safe, natural-looking results without damaging your enamel or causing sensitivity.

**Why Professional Whitening Outshines DIY Methods**

Sure, there are endless whitening strips, gels, and toothpaste options on the shelves—but not all smiles are created equal. Over-the-counter products often offer uneven results and can irritate your gums if used incorrectly.

That’s where professional care makes the difference. With a tailored [**Teeth Whitening Treatment in Nassau County**](https://www.drphildds.com/illuminate-your-smile-explore-the-art-of-teeth-whitening-treatment-in-nassau-county-at-philip-m-tornatore/), you’re not just whitening—you’re investing in precision and long-lasting brilliance. The benefits include:

* **Customized care:** Treatments are tailored to your tooth shade and sensitivity level.
* **Faster results:** Professional-grade whitening agents work efficiently, brightening your smile in as little as one visit.
* **Long-lasting effects:** With proper aftercare, your radiant smile can last months—or even years.
* **Safety and comfort:** Expert supervision ensures your gums and enamel are protected throughout the process.

**A Smile Worth Showing Off**

Your smile is one of the first things people notice about you. When you feel confident about it, everything changes—from the way you speak to how you carry yourself in a room. Teeth whitening isn’t about vanity; it’s about self-assurance.

Dr. Phil DDS understands that every patient’s journey to a brighter smile is unique. Whether your goal is to prepare for a big event, restore brightness after years of discoloration, or simply treat yourself to a confidence boost, his approach is gentle, professional, and completely personalized.

**What to Expect During Your Whitening Experience**

Stepping into a dental office for cosmetic treatment can feel intimidating, but at Dr. Phil DDS, comfort always comes first. The process is quick, simple, and surprisingly relaxing:

1. **Consultation:** The team evaluates your current shade and discusses your goals.
2. **Preparation:** A protective barrier is applied to safeguard your gums.
3. **Whitening session:** A professional-grade gel is carefully applied and activated under specialized light.
4. **Results:** You’ll walk out with a noticeably brighter, healthier-looking smile—often several shades lighter than before.

The entire experience typically takes under an hour, leaving you with instant results and renewed confidence.

**Keeping That Glow Alive**

After your whitening treatment, maintaining that brilliance is easy with a few mindful habits. Limit dark beverages like coffee, tea, and wine, rinse your mouth after meals, and stick to your dentist’s recommended touch-up routine. Regular cleanings and dental checkups will also help preserve that pearly shine.

And if you ever notice your smile starting to fade, Dr. Phil’s office offers touch-up sessions designed to keep your teeth radiant all year round.

**Let Your Smile Steal the Spotlight**

Life’s too short to hide your smile. Whether you’re walking into a meeting, laughing with friends, or posing for photos, you deserve to feel confident every time you flash those pearly whites.

If you’re ready to take the first step toward a brighter, more confident you, why not connect with a team that truly understands the art and science of a beautiful smile? **Visit** [**Dr. Phil DDS**](https://www.drphildds.com/) to explore how their expert whitening treatments can help your smile shine as brilliantly as your personality.",1,1764740293.0,dentalbonding,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend, who’s dad is a Pastor, says this is normal for people who work at the church (usually younger people associated with college campus ministry at least in my case) to invite people out to eat to talk about God and get to know them. I get it to a certain point, but like, they never reach out again if you tell them you have no time to go out. Like we can’t just text about these things? I’m extremely social don’t get me wrong, but I don’t want to go out to eat with someone who has to go out to eat with every new member to develop a relationship with them. I’m trying to get baptized and reached out to someone who organizes them at church and instead of just simply explaining to me the details and process I’d have to go through to make it happen, I get hit with, “I’d love to answer your questions over lunch sometime!” Like?

I am 25, male. I work as a chef and have had a pretty rough past. On top of work, I’m also studying part-time. And maybe because I live alone, that further exacerbates my lack of social life as I usually work > sleep > work > class > sleep. Also probably why I’ve grown accustomed to staying home and converted into a homebody.

Looking to expand my social circle. Looking mainly for gaming friends. I recently got back into League after many years, so looking for a duo. Aside from League, I play TFT, Valorant, Apex Legends.

Some of my other hobbies include anime and dramas, reading and writing (fiction/magic), coffee, cooking, mahjong, and model kit building (gunpla).

Just resigned and decided will take a month-long break to reset and hopefully fix a bit of my mental health + catch up on studies and just unwind, before I resume work again next year.

I host mahjong with a friend or two occasionally, maybe once or twice a month, so am always looking for friends for mahjong as well. (west/southwest)

Connections wise, I’ve previously opened a FnB stall, and looking to hear more advice/stories from others that have opened FnB businesses as I am hoping to open one again in the near future. 
Also looking for help/to teach me for my coding subject to code a html site. 

PS : If you’re a toxic gamer, please don’t even bother to text me. i absolutely despise people that BM or are toxic in general.

I have been playing for almost 2 years now and since they were adding such a huge expansion and activities I finally caved and bought a year of FO1st (after the free trial earlier had tempted me) and the fact that I was tired of inventory management and constant carry weight monitoring. 

That was on Monday past and I was also happy because there was also news via YouTube vids that the were heavily discounting previous catch up bundles and there was some stuff I really wanted.  I had also grinded the robot and took myself up 75 levels to reach player rank 500 and got all the Vulcan armour and mods and a good amount of 4 star mods Also hit level 219 on the season pass and had been investing tickets into atoms.  

I sat up until 1am refreshing in hope, then caved.  I’m at work now with a strong cup of coffee reading the various reports and updates on the outage. I hope the outage does not mess up our camps as I’ve seen reports from people saying stuff was invalid and the items scrapped.

Anyone else feeling like they're slowly turning into a rusty tin man these days? 😅 Seriously, getting out of bed in the morning has become a whole *thing*. I swear, I creak louder than my grandma's rocking chair!

So, I decided to do something about it. I’ve been hearing a lot about yoga and pilates, especially for us ""more seasoned"" folks, and thought, “What the heck? Might as well give it a shot!”

But which one? Yoga? Pilates? It felt like choosing between coffee and tea - both are great, but totally different vibes.

Well, after 3 weeks of diving headfirst (okay, maybe gently easing myself) into both, I have some surprising results to share!

Here's the lowdown:

*   **Stiffness Factor:** Honestly, both helped! BUT, yoga seemed to get me moving a *little* bit faster in the mornings. All those stretches… felt SO good on my tight hamstrings! I'm talking about being able to bend over to tie my shoes without making ""the noise"" (you know the one!)
*   **Core Strength:** Pilates definitely wins here. I can actually feel my abs now! Remember those? 😂Seriously though, all those controlled movements really engage your core. I feel like I'm standing taller and my back doesn't ache as much after gardening.
*   **Mental Zen:** Yoga takes the cake. The breathing exercises and the focus… it's like a mini-vacation for my brain. Plus, the shavasana at the end? Pure bliss. I could almost hear the ocean while I was doing it (might have just been the neighbor's leaf blower, but still!).
*   **Overall Feeling:** Okay, this is where it gets interesting. I thought Pilates would be too hard, but it was actually empowering! Yoga was calming and a great way to start the day. It felt like I could finally begin to feel like the strongest people, especially after checking out this amazing guide: [We believe in strongest people.](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb)
*   **The Unexpected:** I started sleeping better! I toss and turn less, and wake up feeling more rested. Who knew a little stretching and core work could do that?

So, what does this all mean? Well, I'm no expert, but for me, a little bit of both seems to be the magic formula. I’m trying to do yoga a few mornings a week and sneak in some Pilates exercises whenever I can.

What about you all? Have you tried yoga or Pilates? What are your experiences? Are you creaking as much as I was? 😉 Any tips or favorite routines you’d like to share? I’m all ears!

1pcvwqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce_trends/comments/1pcvwqh/how_to_run_amazon_ads_in_india/,How to Run Amazon Ads in India,"To be honest, my initial attempt to decipher **Amazon ads in India** felt like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics. Although the platform's options, such as Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, and Sponsored Display, are fantastic, they can also be a little overwhelming when you're looking at the dashboard at two in the morning with nothing but coffee and hope.



I began by learning to uphold the basics. Clear, keyword-optimised, and aesthetically pleasing product listings are essential. A listing that looks like it was uploaded hurriedly during a power outage cannot be compensated for with any amount of advertising funds. Then comes the beginning modestly. Start by running campaigns automatically. Real keyword data is provided without breaking the bank thanks to Amazon's algorithm, which handles the heavy lifting. This is the simplest way to comprehend the true behaviour of Amazon ads in India.

Then comes the fun-and-slightly-scary part: manual campaigns. Here's where you pick your own keywords, adjust your bids, and basically pretend to be a PPC pro. I realized quickly that you can't just ""set and forget."" Daily optimisation is key. And if you're terrible at numbers, this part may feel like doing Maths homework you didn't sign up for.

That's when I discovered Paxcom. They became the adult supervision I sorely needed, and I don't mean to sound promotional. Kinator, their digital shelf analytics tool, helped me figure out what my competitors were doing, which keywords were really important, and why my ads were occasionally acting like mischievous teenagers. Paxcom does not just throw data at you; it makes it usable.

If you want to scale, get the basics right, keep trying, and don't be scared to get help from a professional. Occasionally, a little guidance can save a significant amount of time and money.

I took the bottom to check the power cable and make sure it was secure.  My wife was telling me the cable had to be in a very specific orientation in order for the coffee maker to work.

Anyway, he wandered into my yard and came back carrying a dead squirrel. He tells me it’s “perfect for a mixed-media piece” he’s working on and asks if he can use it. I said no. Like, absolutely not. He goes on this whole spiel about “nature speaks through me” or whatever, and my uncle rolls his eyes and says I’m being uptight.

Carl then puts the squirrel on my kitchen counter while I’m trying to make coffee and starts fussing over it like it’s some fragile treasure. I lost it. Gloves on, double-bagged, and threw it in the outside trash.

When he came back and saw it gone, he flipped out. “You destroyed my vision!” he yelled, and my uncle just kinda sighed at me like I was the bad guy.

1pcvs1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakdancing/comments/1pcvs1c/25_years_later_i_think_i_finally_want_to_learn/,"25 years later, I think I finally want to learn how to get windmills down.","I'm 34 years old, and when I was younger, I used to mess around with breakdancing a bit. When I was from 12-18 I could comfortably do turtles, coffee grinders, and even a really nice opening kick for a flare. I never could do much more than that, and I definitely could never do windmills no matter how much I tried. 

Lately I've been watching more and more videos and I'm just thinking how awesome it would be if I could finally do it. On so many tutorials, I keep seeing people saying that it's important to stab to setup another revolution, but when I see people doing windmills in motion, they almost never stab? It's like they just somehow effortlessly roll off of their forearms while keeping their legs up high. I never understood how this was possible. When my belly is facing the ground, my feet always hit the ground as well. I can't seem to keep my feet up off the ground unless I stab and I shift my weight forward so that my head is touching the ground. 

I know it's probably going to be harder than ever to learn this since I'm nowhere near my teenage weight or nimbleness, but man I would still love to learn this. I've seen plenty of videos of guys even heavier than I am who make it look fairly easy. Any tips would be appreciated, and even more so, if there are tutorial vids that you think are better at explaining it more than others, I would really love to see them.

1pcvr20,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1pcvr20/will_a_lapsurgery_help_bowel_endo/,Will a lap/surgery help bowel endo?,"Hi! 

I'm finally getting to see a specialist/surgeon in January for a consult, but I wanted to asked some questions.

First, a little about my case: suspected, hasn't  shown on any scans, did have PCS though and got that sorted last year. Currently on dienogest so I haven't had a period in over a year. Also on Aventil for migraines but it helps a teensy bit for some pain too.

  
My biggest problems: 

\*disabled. I can only stand for an hour before I get bad back pain. Aventil helps with this but standing longer than an hour WILL also flare me and I'll have pain for days. 

\*painful BMS. It's not all of the time but most of the time. Getting worse with flares. I'll feel nauseous first then very sick then pain then gas then completely normal BM. Sometimes cramping after but not always. Also painful gas a lot.

\*I'm already celiac, but I've been losing foods I used to be able to eat. Garlic/onions, decaf coffee, yogurt, rice (regular not rice flour), salad (in fact most veggies except for Cucumber and peppers), meat if it's too fatty, chips etc all in the last 6-8 months. Wondering if I'm having MCAS symptoms but I've read a lot of people saying losing foods is normal for bowel endo until you get an excision. (Is this true)

So basically, do you think going for the lap/excision would make a difference for me? And is there anything I should ask/tell my specialist at my appointment? 

Thanks

I woke up to my obnoxious alarm disturbing my weed induced sleep from the night before. I peered over and grabbed my phone off my night stand to shut it up. I pulled myself up out of bed with a disgruntled and aching groan “I’m too young to feel like this” I thought to myself as I prepared for another Monday just like the countless Mondays before. I slid on the same ragged old Levi’s jeans that barely hung onto my waist with the help of a belt my mom got me so many Christmas’s ago. I loaded my pockets with everything necessary to complete my day. “Phone, keys, wallet and my dab pen” I said to myself as I patted my pockets like I was playing myself like an instrument. I walked outside to be met with a brisk morning, my car windows had a frost over them that I so badly did not want to scrape off.


I opened my car door and turned the key and the car reluctantly fired up almost cursing me for forcing it to run another day. My commute to work was about 30 minutes east of the small rural town I lived in. Surrounded my trees and dense forest. I didn’t mind the drive it gave me time to think about my day and sip my coffee in peace while listening to whatever music or podcast i decided I liked that day. 


today we went with rock music. I arrived at work being greeted by all the coworkers I’d known for the 3 months since I’d be hired at this landscape company some were young adults like me in their late or early 20s and a few were older mostly worked desk jobs but regardless they were tolerable


. I got the information for the day for a house in a more rural outskirt part of town not too far away but enough to let ya know we’d be out there all day because there’s no sense in doing it half way and coming back into the city. My coworker Dez and I loaded our leaf blowers, rakes and trash bags along with other items needed to complete this fall cleanup into an old work truck.


Dez is a marathon athlete who spends a lot of her time running or hiking or telling me about hiking she’s going to do. I listen intently as she goes on about how she wants to get a new tattoo to commemorate her latest hike. 


I stare blankly out the window while the radio spews information about the weather and deals at some mattress place in the city. We finally arrive at our destination, it’s a nice enough house out in the forest with a swooping drive way wide enough for our truck to ease right up in front of the garage. Usually when we arrive we let the customer know and talk to them for any questions and concerns they have before we clean their property.

Dez asked me to do it this time since she was fueling up our leaf blowers, so I nodded and then walked out to the large thick wooden door with decorative glass in the center. I rung the door bell, rehearsing the customer service voice and lines I’ve said time and time again. To my relief there was no answer I was glad not to have to awkwardly speak to any strangers.


 I walked back over and let Dez know, she nodded without taking her eyes off the blower she was trying to get fired up even though it was fighting the cold just as my car did. She finally got it to start and went marching off to the back of the property so I took that as “okay I’ll do the front” so I grabbed my own blower finally started it up and began making piles of debris and leaves, or whatever else I could Rangel up. About an hour and a half went by and it was time to bag up all the piles id made.


I took a roll of cheap giant black trash bags and a rake as I set off to clean up the loosely organized piles I’d made. About the two hour mark is when I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I clicked the button on my ear bud and Led Zeppelin came screeching to a halt in my ear. I looked around panning the woods and as I got to be able to see the windows of the old cabin I saw a woman through the window , a small half dead tree was slightly blocking my view. 


I waved awkwardly but instead of the same response back that I expected the woman cocked her head like a curious animal deciding “food, friend or foe” it made me uneasy I put my hand down and smiled awkwardly what she did next really off put me. She grinned, head still cocked but the grin was so forced like she was teaching herself by watching me, like she’d smiled for the first time and it was a failed attempt. “What the fuck” I muttered to myself and then as fast as she’d appeared she swooped out of view like a hand dodging the angry bite of an animal. I felt so sick and weirded out.


I wanna go be around someone else so I walked back to the truck took my coat off because it was beginning to warm up a little bit. I heard a shuffled footstep behind me and jumped as a sheepish man jumped back from me because my frightened demeanor had scared him back “I’m so sorry” I muttered half curious and anxious as I could be.


 “It’s fine” he replied almost whispering because he didn’t want to be heard. “Can I help you” I asked trying to pull myself together and go into business mode. “I don’t think so” he said and I laughed nervously because what the hell do I say to that “did she see you” he whispered. I froze knowing exactly what he was talking about but I said “what?” “Who?” Almost matching his concerned tone. My mind rapidly replaying the horrendous memory as I imagined back to seeing that grim large mouthed grin and as I started to remember more the ladies eyes were black more like a dolls eyes like black buttons loosely placed on the limp skin.



I reverted my gaze back to the man. His cautious expression still glooming on his face. “I..I saw her yea” “oh..did she see you?” He said softly like he was worried about me. “Yea we exchanged smiles and” he cut me off and came closer I was to frozen to step back, he placed a tired worn out shaky hand on my shoulder and looked my right in the eyes, his began to swell with tears that made his bright blue sunken eyes glisten like night stars.


. “You have to leave here and please don’t come back I’ll try to keep it here but I need you to get as far away as you can” “what are you talking about?” I said “no time” he replied “no time no time” he muttered to himself as he shuffled away back around the backside of the house and through a side door into the blackness of the cabin. “What..the..fuck” I whispered too dumbstruck to fathom a thought. Luckily it was lunch Time so Dez had come back and put her stuff back in the bed of the truck and be lumbered down the driveway with a trailer full of black bags full to the brim of leaves and whatever else we had found.



“Hungry?” She asked, “no i..I think im gonna go home my stomach hurts” I was pretty good about never calling out so she was okay with that and I was taken back to the office I grabbed my things in a hurry and drove off. I was on the highway home replaying the thoughts in my head over and over I couldn’t get that woman’s grin out of my fucking head “why? What..what was it?” I said to myself. I tried to shake it off and ignore it even though it was almost impossible. I live alone so when I came back to my house I was relieved to see my dog waiting for me.


Like She always does at the front door licking and jumping excited to see me and to eat. I played with her and marched up my stairs with more aching groans with each step “I need to find a desk job” I thought to myself. After a shower, a smoked bowl and some tv I went off to bed upstairs like any other night, my dog curled up next to me.



I drifted off into sleep, I awoke but not to my alarm. I awoke to hear tapping on the window behind my headboard. At first I was so groggy and half stoned still I felt like just brushing it off and going back to bed but the tapping persistence was so obnoxious that I sat up annoyed and then I froze remembering I’m on the second story and there’s no balcony outside my window.


 I sunk back down into my bed pulling the sheets up to my chin like a child scared of some monster in his closet. There was enough moonlight to see a shadow an outline of a person tap tap tap sounding like rocks on glass. I peered up over my head board only to catch a glimpse of the side profile of a sunken face with a long grin. I slunk back down so fast I whacked my head on the head board “shit” I muttered. “Oh shit oh shit” I said to my self slipping out of my bed trying not to be seen. I remembered I leave the doggy door open for my dog at night incase she needs to use the restroom. It doesn’t matter to me there’s no intruders out here and if there is my dog and a shotgun would do the trick to fend them off. But this wasn’t a regular intruder. I sprinted down my stairs the house was cold and all I had on were my briefs, the cold tile pierced my soft foot pads like nails into wet wood. My dog wasn’t in the house.. i immediately thought the worst and began to panic coming up with any idea to try and save my poor dog. “I’ve gotta go out there” I thought. “I’ve gotta save her” I threw on my old robe and some sneakers and grabbed my 12 gauge, loaded 5 shells and one in the tube and sprinted out the back door into the darkness peering up swiftly at the window where that thing had been. But it was gone. It had left, or maybe it was hiding and waiting for me to turn my back “Sadie!” I yelled for my dog and I whistled just like I would and she’d come running like she usually did but no instead I was greeted with a chilling silence like a heavy blanket laid over the night.

“No..no” as tears filled my eyes. Just as I was about to mourn the loss of my 4 legged friend I heard a creaking sound from above me on top of the house. I had made my way to the front porch while calling for Sadie and I was now on the front steps. I backed away trying to feel for the door knob as I heard the creaking coming to the edge of the porch roof. Then it all stopped and got incredibly silent. As I slowly turned the handle I heard a raspy voice almost like it was trying to sound like..me? “Sadie” it said my bones went cold with fear “Sadie?” It said again trying to whistle now but sounding more like a screech than anything. Too frightened to look away and run inside I kept my eyes focused on the noise and as I glared into the night two floppy ears and two paws grasped the underside of the porch clawing its way down just to where I could see the horror that presented itself to me. My beloved dog it’s loose skin pulled tight enough to form a big grin and a cocked head to me, eyes that were black and empty I screamed “get away” as I pushed the door open and fell on top of my gun shutting the door with my foot and scrambling to lock it.

RENT NEGOTIABLE W/ COPAY OPT (Jan-Aug 2026),"I am a graduate student at the U, Twin Cities campus and I’m hoping to move out of my studio apartment on the 5th floor of the 700 on Washington Apartments (https://www.700washington.com/) by the end of December. The unit is located facing the east side and gets a lot of sunlight. I am attaching the floor plan for your reference. 

I am looking for someone to take over my lease starting January until the end of July, 2026. You can renew it for the next term as well! 

Considering the price, here are some undeniable benefits of this apartment for me: 

1. It is walking distance from the east bank train station, bus stops, campus, Walgreens, CVS, and all the food places and grocery stores in stadium village and around. 
2. It is FULLY FURNISHED by the management. This includes; a bed, a couch, a TV, Desk, Chairs (one lounge and one study), kitchen appliances like the refrigerator and microwave, storage drawers for clothes and, ofc, closet space, a TV stand with shelves, side tables, etc! I didn’t have to buy any furniture when moving in except some lamps for different lighting. 
3. As I’m moving out, you can keep my lamps! (This includes two standing lamps and one standing bedside lamp with shelves!). I also have couch cushions, chair cushions, and reading pillows I’m willing to leave for you to use. I can also leave my faux plants and Amazon Fire Stick, if you like some decor and entertainment. 
4. The apartment is at the far end of the building facing east, so, you get a beautiful view of the sunrise, lots of sunlight, and can even the huntington bank stadium clearly . AND as it’s high enough and on the different end, there is barely any noise from Sally’s. My neighbours have been quiet and not disruptive at all these past few years.
5. I haven’t had many maintenance issues, thankfully, but I always have someone look over any requests I make the very next day. 
6. Laundry in-unit! Dishwasher works great! Shower works well! Central AC and heating! Two windows! 
7. You can keep pets but you will have to get permission as I don’t have them listed in the lease. 
8. They have a lounge on the 6th floor, study and meeting rooms in the first floor, and a fitness center (+ tanning bed!) in the basement. 
9. If you check the price on the website, you’ll see that I pay lesser than what’s listed. You get to take over the same price!! 

If you are interested and want to know more about the unit or need some pictures for reference, please feel free to DM me. ",1,1764739226.0,umnhousing,0,1.0,False

Need feedback on UI/UX,"Over the last little while, I’ve been experimenting with building small, focused iOS apps around habits I care about. One of those habits is gratitude journalling – taking a few minutes to note what went well or what I’m thankful for at the end of the day.

Out of that came Daily Journal: Diary with lock ([https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-journal-diary-with-lock/id6754467750?ppid=ebce632e-6bcb-41db-b949-53637b968690](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-journal-diary-with-lock/id6754467750?ppid=ebce632e-6bcb-41db-b949-53637b968690)), a simple and secure space for daily gratitude, personal reflections, and memories.

My aim with this app was to make opening your journal feel calm and inviting, not like using another productivity tool. A few of the core things I focused on:

🔒 Truly private and secure: Your entries are for your eyes only. You can lock your journal with your device Passcode or Face ID, and all data is stored securely on your device.

🎨 Customizable look and feel: You can change backgrounds, wallpapers, and fonts so your journal feels personal and matches your mood.

🧘 Small wellness touches: If you want a moment to settle before writing, you can start a short guided breathing session or reflect on a Quote of the Day and then write what you’re grateful for.

📱 Made for iOS: A clean, native experience built for both iPhone and iPad so you can write wherever you are.

Pricing: Free

I’m a solo developer, and this has been a fun little passion project alongside my other apps. I’d really appreciate any honest feedback you’re willing to share. How does it feel for daily gratitude journalling? What do you like, what’s missing, and what could be improved?

I could feel some persisting low pain in the stomach, I could feel occasional acid reflux, and had 2 or 3 bad nausea post-meals.

I stopped spicy food, coffee and alcohol for 2 months, while taking pantoprazole. The situation quickly improved after just a few weeks but stalled and wasn't fully recovered. I then restarted to drink alcohol on the weekends (enough to get drunk) to keep my sanity and social life.

This went on a few more months living with this very tolerable pain. But now the pain started to to radiate in the ribs (both sides, but mostly left) and in the back. As usual its not a severe pain, more like a dull pain, that come and go. The acid reflux increased too. A difference now is this nausea feeling that I get more often (Not sure I am confusing it with hunger as I've been eating much smaller meals tho). I get more constipated, but again, might be related to my new eating habit. #edit: Not to forget, work is causing me big stress/anxiety.

I visited a new doctor last week who simply told me that alcohol and eating/drink close to bed time are probably the causes. I raised concerns about pancreas and he told me the pain would be stronger and felt directly in the back. With my current symptoms he don't see a reason to do a scan or blood test yet.

I did insist and will get an ultrasound (is it really bad compared to MRI?) and a blood test tomorrow.

Title pretty much sums it up, but context below, I (25M) am going out with a friend’s (30F) friend (30F). 

About a year ago, I became a regular at a restaurant in my hometown. From there, I became very good friends with the waitstaff, bartenders, busboys and even owners. 

Enter Ally (30F). 

We clicked as soon as I met her. Every time I’d see her, we’d talk the entire night and have a great chat. It felt like really good chemistry, so I built up courage to ask her out. She said yes, so we set a date and I took her to a place in the outskirts of town where we had lunch. It was a horrible time. Both of us felt like deer against headlights. There was no chemistry, conversations were very dry, and at one point, she asked a question that just killed the entire vibe. We tried, but it just didn’t work. Water under the bridge. I saw her in the restaurant later that week and it was all good. We sort of came to an unspoken agreement that maybe it’s best if that was kept just where it was. To this day, we’ll talk like if nothing happened and, again, pretty good friends. 

Then I met Liz (30F). 

A few months ago, I started working temporarily in this new office at my company (I’m a sort of floater employee where they move me to an office where they need me until they don’t and they move me somewhere else. It’s weird, but just trust me on this one). There, I saw Liz. I’ve seen Liz with Ally a few times in town, and even at some events in the restaurant with their mutual friends. When Liz and I started working together, it was only casual and work-related conversations; “good-morning’s”, “do-you-know-what-this-is-about’s”, and “want-some-coffee-I’m-going-on-a-coffee-run’s”. However, the conversations started picking up at some point, and we got to talking a lot more. Eventually, as the floater employee, I got switched to another area where I was needed, but Liz and I kept in touch through text. In fact, we’ve been talking everyday for the last two months. However, I’ve been hesitant to ask her out due to my past with Ally. 

But, this last week, she mentioned a restaurant about 2 hours away and said she really wants to go. 

As a human from the male species, I’m very oblivious to signals and hints, but even I saw that one. 

I suggested we make a road trip, drive up, have lunch, spend the day in the area, and then grab dinner on the way back. She said yes in what was possibly the quickest text message she has replied with. 

I really like Liz, but I don’t know if I’m being an AH to Ally. I really feel like the 6-9 months of separation between a date with Ally and the date with Liz is, 1) a long time for things to have settled, and 2) nothing happened between Ally and I.

Am I overthinking? Or AITAH?",0,1764738024.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False
1pcva1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1pcva1z/parking_tips_for_dance_to_the_holidays_at/,parking tips for dance to the holidays at tropicana showroom (atlantic city 12/04),"  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the dance to the holidays show on sunday 12/04 at 3:30 pm. ac parking can honestly be a nightmare, especially when there’s a show, so getting the plan right is key to avoiding traffic and sticker shock.  
  
first up, the most chill option is usually to skip the casino drama entirely. check out an app like prked (always capitalize Prked). people in the area rent out their driveways or private garage spots right next to the tropicana, and it's almost always way cheaper than the casino rate. you pre-book, skip all the traffic lines to get into the trop's garages, and it’s a short walk.  
  
now for the standard options.  
  
the tropicana self-parking: the casino has two main garages, garage a and the quarter garage. since this is a sunday and a show, expect them to hit you with the weekend or a ""special event"" rate. the regular weekend self-park rate is often around $20 , but for a show it can jump up to $30 or even $50, so be prepared for that possibility . pro tip - if you have a caesars rewards card (even the gold one) and play a few dollars on the slot machines to earn 10 points, you can often get a free parking voucher at a kiosk when you exit . or, if you plan to eat at a restaurant in the quarter like carmine's or pf chang's, ask if they validate for a reduced rate, sometimes as low as $5-$10 . valet is way more, skip it unless you hate walking.  
  
off-site and cheaper: if you don't want to mess with the casino or prked, look at the other non-casino garages or lots nearby. the best deal in the area is often the wave parking garage near boardwalk hall. if you spend $50 or more at tanger outlets the walk on 12/04, you can get your parking validated for up to 8 hours for just $4 . that’s a huge saving if you were planning to shop or grab some coffee anyway. otherwise, you can find other non-casino lots a few blocks away for around $10 .  
  
street parking alert: this is a sunday, and while meters are technically enforced seven days a week, sometimes from 8 am to 11 pm , some ordinances actually state ""no fee shall be charged for parking at any meter on sundays"" . this is a mixed message, so you absolutely must read the sign on the exact block you park on, and check the meter itself. if you do find an available meter spot, you’re looking at $1-$2 an hour . this is a gamble, but if you get there super early it might pay off.  
  
timing advice: the show is at 3:30 pm. traffic into the tropicana's garages on a sunday afternoon can start backing up around 1:30-2:00 pm as the earlier day-trippers mix with show-goers. plan to be parked and walking by 2:30 pm at the absolute latest, earlier if you want to use a validation or find street parking.  
  
hope this helps everyone get in and out smoothly for the show! have a blast!",1,1764737970.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1pcv7ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1pcv7ed/parking_tips_for_dvorak_new_world_symphony_at/,parking tips for dvorak new world symphony at orchestra hall-mn (minneapolis 12/04),"  
  
figured i'd share some parking tips for the dvorak new world symphony on 12/04. parking downtown for an 11:00 am weekday show is a whole different beast than evening concerts because you're fighting all the regular business and commuter traffic. you need a plan, honestly.  
  
my absolute best insider tip is to check out Prked. this is an app for renting private driveways or empty spots in apartment building garages, usually in the loring park area right next to orchestra hall . it is way cheaper than the major ramps, you skip all the main ramp traffic lines, and it's usually just a short walk. it’s the best way to dodge the headache.  
  
if you prefer a ramp, the official one everyone uses is the skyway-connected 11th and marquette ramp . it's the most convenient for sure. just remember to keep your parking ticket with you once you pull it, because you need to scan it to get back in from the street level door . expect to pay $15-$20 here for an event stay .  
  
to save a few bucks on a ramp spot, check apps like spothero \*before\* you leave. you can often pre-book a spot at the nearby convention center lot for around $5.99 (about a 4 minute walk) or the 11th street underground garage for around $9.99, which is a significant saving over the drive-up rates . getting a guaranteed, prepaid spot cuts down on stress big time.  
  
valet is an option on 11th street. for the morning ""coffee concert"" it's available from 9:30 am to 1:30 pm . if you pre-order it online, it's $23, but if you just drive up, it's $28, and they don't guarantee a spot if you just drive up . for a mid-day show, valet is definitely the fastest way in and out.  
  
street parking is available, but you need to be super careful. you absolutely must use the minneapolis parking app to check the rules and max time for any meter you find . since it's a weekday, all meters will be enforced. look for spots near loring park, but remember the strict rules like not parking within 20 feet of any intersection . a ticket is not a fun souvenir.  
  
since it’s an 11:00 am weekday show, you'll be hitting the downtown area right after peak morning rush hour, so the streets are still going to be busy . try to arrive and be parked by 10:30 am to give yourself a relaxed 30 minutes to get to your seat, grab a coffee, and beat the final rush of concert goers. hope this helps, and enjoy the show!",1,1764737732.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I read through the comments on the recent post about homeschooling on this sub, and all the pro-homeschool points make a ton of sense. I agree with most of them (besides the alt-right, religious reasons). Mostly, I value less exposure to kids who aren’t being parented properly (ie allowed access to the internet, allowed to cuss, etc), less exposure to screens in early grades, and more one-on-one attention and catering to their interests so that they like to learn.

However, and this may get me judged here, I have a hard time with the commitment to being home with my kids all day every day. I am a mom who needs her morning coffee shop stop after school drop off, being able to clean the house in peace with a podcast or music on, and even reading a book maybe before I go and pick them up. That is something that fills my cup and refreshes me to parent for the rest of the day. I so WISH I was the homesteading mom that I see online who genuinely thrives on mothering 24/7, but I’ll admit I’m not like that! 

I guess I just want to make this post as reassurance for anyone who is feeling the same way. If you homeschool I think you are a super mom! If your kids are in a traditional school environment, you are also a good mom who knows what is best for your family, but I see you if you’re like me and think you could be doing better but can’t commit to it, whether that’s because of work or reasons like mine.",21,1764737537.0,moderatelygranolamoms,32,0.74,False

Hi, I’m 37M, 5'7, and I work from home for both EU and US companies, so weekdays are usually packed for me. Pag weekends naman, I like going out, exploring new spots, or grabbing coffee to decompress after a long week. I’m a foodie who enjoys simple but meaningful dates and trying out new places.

I’m Catholic if that matters to you, and I used to be a church keyboardist and guitarist. I can sing too, so music has always been part of my life. I enjoy trying new things, whether it’s a café, a hidden restaurant, or something spontaneous to make weekends more fun. I don’t have a car, but I do have a stable and good job. And syempre, kapag date, ako sasagot sa gastos.

When it comes to relationships, I appreciate someone who communicates well, updates naturally, and knows how to handle things with maturity. I value emotional intelligence and calm conversations because they keep things steady and healthy. I’m not into drama, and I prefer a relationship that’s simple, honest, and grounded.

About You:

I’m hoping to meet someone petite, chinita, at maputi, ideally between 27 to 35 years old, with a stable job and living within Metro Manila. Bonus points if you’re from QC near SM Fairview and Fairview Terraces. Mas okay if you’re also a foodie and someone who enjoys trying new things.

1pcv4dl,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smartbuyer-ai/id6754336025,5 rejections by Apple; but still managed to release my iOS app,"Alright y’all… I gotta share this because I’m still kinda shocked it even happened.

I’ve been grinding on this app called SmartBuyer AI. It helps people figure out home affordability, monthly payments, hidden costs, all the stuff nobody teaches you. It’s just me building this. No team. No budget. Just late nights, coffee, and way too many “should I even keep doing this” moments.

But Apple rejected me five times. And almost every single rejection was for subscription issues.

Not the UI. Not the value. Not the features. Just the subscription stuff.

One time it was the prices not being clear enough.
Another time they didn’t like the wording of my trial message.

Another was because I didn’t describe the subscription benefits exactly how they wanted.
Then they hit me with “Your subscription screen is not aligned to our guidelines.”
And one of the rejections literally felt like they just didn’t vibe with my layout that day.

Every time I’d submit, I’d get that “Your app has been rejected” email and I swear my soul left my body. By the fourth rejection I was ready to throw my phone in the ocean and start a gardening business.

But I just kept fixing it. Rewriting copy. Tweaking the paywall. Adjusting the onboarding. Re recording demos. Updating screenshots. Reading the App Store guidelines like it was a survival manual. Every time I hit submit it felt like sending a resume to an employer who already rejected me five times.

Then out of nowhere… they approved it.

No warning. No encouragement. Just “Your app is ready for sale.” And honestly that one line made all the frustration worth it.

So yeah… SmartBuyer AI is officially live on the App Store after five subscription related rejections. After questioning myself way too much. After thinking I wasn’t cut out for this.

I’m proud of it. Not because it’s perfect. It’s not. But because I didn’t quit. And if you’re building something, please don’t quit either.

If anyone wants to check it out and give me real feedback.

Tell me what you think. What needs work. What would make it better. What features I should add for buyers or real estate agents. I’m open to all of it.

#Part Two Summary 

**Izzy**

Things are not going well in the share house. Ziggy and Cedar are yelling at each other and Izzy is fed up with it. Phil thinks it could all be solved if the two of them just hooked up. Wynn tells them about Phoenix being Cedar's sister, and how Cedar was threatening to move out. Izzy was brought up by two lesbians, Mo and Darlene, whose hobby was discussing feelings.  She goes around there for a visit to talk about Cedar. Mo tells Izzy that she should have more empathy for Cedar who hadn't been as fortunate as Izzy.  Mo had looked after Izzy when Darlene studied and worked.  When Izzy returns to the house, she watches Native TikTok with Cedar.

**Paulina Traverse**

Paul is constantly worried about M, who is sick of her mother's overprotectiveness.  She knows why M has been in a bad mood.  Paul chats to her sister Lou, asking about her new man.  M talks about moving out, which Pete isn't unhappy about, as Paul hadn't given him much attention over the years.  Paul is coming to terms with knowing that M's attacker is out, after Jake, her nephew, had informed her.  When Lou comes over, she announces that Phoenix has gone missing.  Lou wonders if someone has done something to Phoenix.

**Lisa**

Lisa has had a stroke. She lives with her daughter Jesse, and great grandson Sparrow. They live near the school, and she likes to sit outside in the sun, hoping to spot Sparrow at play.  Detective Scott calls her about the report she made - she had spotted Phoenix outside the school watching her son.  A boy had then approached Phoenix, showed her something, then they walked off together.  The police aren't that interested and question her eyesight.

**Angie**

Angie arrives home and Ship,  who has been pacing around the kitchen, tells her about Phoenix.  Kyle has told him that  Phoenix was approached by a kid who works at the drop-in centre, and he suspects this person might have tried to do something to her.  Angie dismisses his fear, saying Phoenix can hold her own, but she knew that anything threatening his family made him angry.  Angie's family had often advised her to leave this man, who lived in her stylish house, but they didn't know him.  Uncle Toby calls to ask if they've seen Elsie, who Angie thinks is a waste of space.  Angie sees a present from Joey, Ship's long-lost brother, and thinks about Ship's family. His mother Margaret was a real piece of work who died of a heart attack, and Phoenix was crazy.  She feels grateful in the house he bought her, and safe, but is extremely scared for Ship.

**Cheryl Traverse**

Paulina calls her mother Cheryl to say that Jake is in jail, accused of hurting Phoenix.  Cheryl has moved out of the city and is back with her ex, Joe, with whom she fights. Joe is quite into breathing techniques. She calls Louisa who says a witness had identified Jake, who had a knife on him. Louisa tells Cheryl that she is not needed, so she goes for a walk, feeling helpless and lonely.  She remembers a conversation she once had with her mother, Flora, on the meaning of life.  For Flora, it was her family.  She told Cheryl she should include herself in the concept of family; you need to love yourself.  In the bush, it's the first time she has been rested. She tells Joe she doesn't need to go, and they drive to the lake.

**Shawn**

Shawn had searched for his father, Gus, and has been visiting him weekly, sharing coffee and donuts. He hadn't informed his wife Nikki yet about this. Just as he decides to tell Cedar first, she calls him with the news about Phoenix. He is with Gus at the time, and when he explains that he has to leave, Gus looks him in the eye and tells him he must go and take care of his girl.

**Waaban**
 
Waaban prefers to be out in the bush where Mother Earth can heal him; as people hurt him. He feels their pain.  Years ago, he went through Ceremony with a patient teacher called Ben. He has noticed that Elsie is calmer now. She tells him that Phoenix is missing but she's not too worried. She asks him about forgiveness and if it's possible to make someone forgive you.  He explains that you can't make anyone do anything, you are only responsible for yourself. Once he didn't know how to be a good man, one who took care of people.  Colonization had resulted in young people believing they were wrong, instead of leading. He still has much to learn and things to undo and redo.

Westwood Public Library has a porno section in the back! But we need more textbooks. I wish that library would have more textbooks instead to get us going there more.

Genre: Simulation/Story

Estimated year of release: Mid 2010s

Graphics/art style: Maybe Pixel, definitely not realistic or 3D

Notable characters:   
\- Definitely: Middle-aged man, female(?) landlord  
\- Maybe: Mother and daughter, elderly man

Notable gameplay mechanics:   
You chose 1 of 2 (maybe 3) protagonists that each have their own story.   
The protagonist I saw was a middle-aged man that needed to pay rent so he sets up a donut stand on the street in front of his apartment.  
You buy the ingredients yourself.  
You make the donuts yourself.  
You set the prices for your products.  
Maybe there was coffee and other products?  
Customers lined up and gave you cash that you had to give change for manually from your register.  
If you couldn't give change, the customers left.  
Once you ran out of stock or time, you had to close your stand and go home.  
You have to make enough money over several days to make your rent payment.

I think one of the other protagonists was a mother and her daughter at a lemonade stand? The third protagonist I think was an elderly man?

Other details: I saw gameplay of this on Youtube (I didn't actually play this myself)  
In the video, he plays with the prices of his donuts before the stand is running. One of the customers comes up and gives him a $100 bill but he doesn't have enough to make change for it so the customer leaves.",2,1764736944.0,tipofmyjoystick,4,1.0,False

We were fine this morning as I was trying to decide on whether or not I should confront her about it. We usually have a morning routine where she buys me coffee along with her own, but she only bought it for herself today. 

I was so upset over everything that I needed time to cool down. I went to the bedroom and she asked me if something is wrong, I was too upset and worried I’d make things worse because of it so I just ignored what she said and kept looking at my phone. She said she’ll try giving me space and that she’s waiting, but after a few hours I still felt upset. I left the house to go to work without saying a word. 

I got back home really late at night because I was talking to my best friend about it after work. She asked me to talk, but I was honestly still just too upset and it was already so late and she has work the next day. On top of it she just didn’t seem remorseful at all. When I said no, she told me to “get out. seriously.” Does this mean she wants to break up?",0,1764736921.0,relationship_advice,6,0.25,False

Hey everyone! I’m a 33 year old born and raised in Michigan, hoping to meet some new people to talk with, vibe with, and hopefully build some easy, real friendships.

A bit about me:
• I’m all about the outdoors during the spring, summer, and fall hiking, kayaking, camping, you name it.
• Winter turns me into a cozy homebody who loves reading, binging shows, drinking way too much coffee, and leaning into all the comfy vibes.
• Personality wise, I’m friendly, laid back, sarcastic, and definitely get sillier the more comfortable I am with someone.

I’m open to chatting with anyone as long as the conversation flows and the energy is right. If you want someone to talk to during odd hours, share hobbies with, swap random thoughts, or just laugh about life, feel free to send a message.",1,1764736734.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

Hi, I’m 37M, 5'7, and I work from home for both EU and US companies, so weekdays are usually packed for me. Pag weekends naman, I like going out, exploring new spots, or grabbing coffee to decompress after a long week. I’m a foodie who enjoys simple but meaningful dates and trying out new places.

I’m Catholic if that matters to you, and I used to be a church keyboardist and guitarist. I can sing too, so music has always been part of my life. I enjoy trying new things, whether it’s a café, a hidden restaurant, or something spontaneous to make weekends more fun. I don’t have a car, but I do have a stable and good job. And syempre, kapag date, ako sasagot sa gastos.

When it comes to relationships, I appreciate someone who communicates well, updates naturally, and knows how to handle things with maturity. I value emotional intelligence and calm conversations because they keep things steady and healthy. I’m not into drama, and I prefer a relationship that’s simple, honest, and grounded.  
  
About You:  
  
I’m hoping to meet someone petite, chinita, at maputi, ideally between 27 to 35 years old, with a stable job and living within Metro Manila. Bonus points if you’re from QC near SM Fairview and Fairview Terraces. Mas okay if you’re also a foodie and someone who enjoys trying new things.

My picture is already on my profile, so if okay sa’yo itsura ko, maybe we can get to know each other better.

I’m a pretty meticulous planner so I’d really appreciate specific suggestions rather than just “check out the beaches.”

If you’ve done short trips to Sydney, what exact places would you recommend for:

* A walk or hike with great views
* A beach that isn’t overly crowded
* A neighbourhood that’s fun to explore for food and coffee
* One or two must-see spots that aren’t the standard Opera House / Harbour Bridge
* Any hidden gems that are easy to reach without a car

I won’t have heaps of time to wander aimlessly so detailed locations or exact spots would help a lot.

1pcujuk,https://i.redd.it/w170mnpb1x4g1.jpeg,There are far sadder implications to Mike not moving an inch getting scooped (Kinda disorganized yap session & sensitive topics),"Now there’s a lot in the air about Micheal letting himself be scooped, he 100% could’ve walked like 10 inches and not get scooped but he didn’t. (Personally one funny theory of mine is that he approaches all situations by just standing still like a deer and it just so happened not to work in this scenario but that’s more just a joke)
Anyway there are theories that say he was tied up somehow in that little time or Ennard’s unseen arm is somehow long enough to keep him in place, but I believe the real reason as to why he let himself is 1. To help Elisabeth escape, and 2. Because he was suicidal.

Micheal is honestly one of my favorite characters in the franchise (as someone who likes the characters far more than the story itself), he’s just so interesting to me, we know that the reason he kept coming back to SL was to somehow find Elizabeth and help her, but looking at it from a story perspective I think the reason why he was so adamant is clear, he regrets what he did to CC and wants to make the effort to be a good brother now.

Now that he ALONE has the chance and is one of THE ONLY people who can find her, he’s on a quest now to finally prove to himself that he can be a good brother now.

After (likely) piecing together that she died during his time in the location I feel like that must’ve took a toll on his mind. If you were to look into his eyes, you’d have to know that you not only killed your own brother and never fully appreciated him while he was alive, but also had failed to protect your younger sister and now she’s stuck in a facility underground, getting tortured because of it.

Mike is a smart character, smart enough to listen to old audio tapes and use the suit his father is trapped in with cheap scares in a horror attraction to combat him. He was very likely aware of Baby’s trickery at this point (like she literally shoved him in a springlock suit the night before and talked about how she lied c’mon), it just doesn’t make much sense for him to be dumb enough to EVEN COME BACK unless you take into account his motivations, FIND HIS SISTER AND HELP HER. At this point he probably felt completely useless, since at the time he had failed everyone he’d loved and let them die, he went through all this trouble for her and risked literally everything for her but he STILL FAILED; at that point Baby was probably aware of that too, she didn’t even need to knock him out or anything, Ennard could’ve totally waited in the hall and caught him like Foxy in Night 3 but there was no point, he’d offer himself up in a heartbeat because this was really all he could offer to her at this point, all he could do to help her.

Now I know it kinda feels like it delves into fan fiction territory but Suicide isn’t exactly new, after all the ending of FNaF 6 is one. If we listen to Mike’s speech at the end of SL we can hear how melancholic he is, after all he failed at almost everything but letting this monster barely recognizable to his sister loose on the world. However it seemed like he found new purpose after dwelling on what his father did.

This especially makes sense on Henry’s whole speech where he says it’s “right where he wants to be” he was find just dying if it gave one final helping hand to his sister, but now, not only is his sister freed, but many other souls and the tragedy if the place along with it, along with taking his father out as well. This is EXACTLY where he wants to be, this is his ideal send off in his eyes, he finally redeemed himself in his eyes by being a good brother in the now.

Anyway yeah Micheal’s character is just so interesting to me because when you really just listen to what him and his peers say he becomes such a tragic character, I genuinely adore him and he’s an amazing hero for the series (and honestly kinda parallels a bit of Coffee from TDH in that regard which just really sells me on him)",11,1764735715.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,0.87,False
