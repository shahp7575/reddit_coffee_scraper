1nb3gez,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nb3gez/aita_for_standing_up_to_a_friend_who_blindsided/,"AITA for standing up to a friend who blindsided me, then blocking him after he ended our friendship?","I (26M) became friends with a guy (let’s call him Charles) after meeting him at the library last year. We clicked pretty quickly and got close fast. We talked openly about life, goals, and struggles, and over time, I met a lot of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like a deep friendship was forming.

That said, I started noticing some things. Charles could be really rigid in conversations (like he always had to be right). Even chill discussions would turn into debates. Still, I stuck around. I gave him relationship advice, shared job tips, and tried to support him whenever he needed it. I thought that support went both ways, but looking back, I’m not so sure.

Earlier this year, we were talking about politics and he told me he was conservative. He asked about my views and I said I leaned liberal. Right away, he said, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I said yeah, my upbringing had some influence, but I’ve formed my own opinions. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to get into it and wasn’t going to quantify it. He kept going anyway, trying to convince me I actually agreed with him deep down. It didn’t feel like a respectful convo—it felt like he was trying to invalidate everything I said.

The next day, I texted him and said I felt disrespected by how he handled the conversation. I wasn’t aggressive (I just wanted to say how I felt and ask for an apology). He told me he doesn’t like texting and wanted to talk in person.

So we met up at Starbucks. I bought him a coffee, thinking we’d clear the air. Instead, it all blew up. The moment we sat down, he went off on me (said I was trying to tear him down, that I have low self-esteem, that I’m controlling, untrustworthy, and that I “love conflict""). It felt like he had been building up resentment and was now unloading all of it. I reminded him of how much I’d supported him (not to throw it in his face, but to show that I always had good intentions).

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over.” Then he told me to get up and hug him. I said no, but offered a handshake instead. He shook my hand and walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one final message and blocked him. It basically said I didn’t agree with the things he said about me, and that I wasn’t okay with being insulted like that. I told him I didn’t want to be friends anymore and that I deserved better. I haven’t spoken to him since.

It’s been about 8 months now. I also stopped going to the Evangelical church he invited me to. Recently, his friend keeps reaching out to me every 2-3 months with a what's up text wanting to grab food. I dont outright reject him but I just tell him I'll let him know. He always watches my social media page (I get notifications) and likes all my posts.

  
AITA in this situation ? And I'm pretty sure his entire community has leaned toward his version of the story. ",1,1757275822.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

A life filled with adventure, discovery, memories, and little things that fill up the gaps.

Let’s bake something new together? I’ll help you clean the kitchen.

Let’s read a new book? I’ll set some tea/coffee for you and put your blanket in the dryer.

Let’s go camping or to the beach? I’ll drive and you’ll be the passenger princess.

Let’s do a late night McDonalds run? You can have my last fry.

There are many more things we can discover together. The things we love, like, dislike, and hate. We can date the old fashioned way and see if we click, perhaps deserving of a second date? Let’s do a cafe date? Let’s go to the movies and I’ll give you a flower. I won’t spoil all my secrets, of course :) we’ll have to level up our relationship to unlock these secret courses 👾🎮

✨A few things you should know about me though;✨
* ﻿﻿I don't condone cheating/one night stands.
* ﻿﻿I don't like smoking
* I am family oriented 
* ﻿﻿I respond quickly, so if you'd like me to adjust that; please feel free to ask! (Reddit varies, it doesn't notify me all the time)
* ﻿﻿I love animals and I have a 9 month old kitty.

✨The things I expect from our relationship;✨
* ﻿﻿Communication! Please tell me how you feel or how something made you feel. We can make a routine on maybe reviewing how we feel at the end of the week and see what improvements we can make to help accommodate each others needs.
* ﻿﻿Loyalty. I love deeply and you will be my priority above all else. I know actions speak more than words and I'm sure""loyalty"" is self explanatory. I'd rather prove my loyalty above just saying it.

1nb3ewf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nb3ewf/after_forty_years_of_living_in_his_shadow_i/,"After Forty Years of Living in His Shadow, I Discovered the Truth of His Double Life—And Found Freedom in the Silence He Left Behind","The phone vibrated sharply against the polished wooden table, making me flinch.
Not the phone I knew. Not the one I had called Dmitry on a thousand times, only to hear his habitual response: “I’m roaming, darling.”

This one was different. Black. Thin. Anonymous. As though it wanted to dissolve into the air, to remain unseen.
I found it by accident, while unpacking his belongings after the funeral. Dmitry had been gone a week, and yet his travel bag still stood in the corner of our bedroom, as though he had just returned and forgotten to put it away. A hidden pocket, a stubborn zip, and inside—this object, both foreign and now strangely familiar.

I looked at it the way one looks at a snake. As if the slightest movement might trigger a bite.
Part of me wanted to leave it alone. To throw it away, unopened.
But my finger slid across the screen.

There was no password.

That startled me. Dmitry had always been meticulous, cautious, obsessed with details. His carelessness here felt like arrogance. Or absolute confidence that no one would ever look.

A chat opened. The contact name: “Sunshine.”
A photograph appeared. A laughing blonde in Dmitry’s arms, framed by sea, palm trees, and sunset. Beneath it, a caption: “Our paradise. Waiting for you in November, my love.” Dated three months ago.

That November he was “launching a new branch in Novosibirsk.”
I remembered ironing his shirts for the trip, packing his blood pressure pills and vitamins.

I opened the gallery.

There they were—at a restaurant, glasses of champagne raised.
There she was—in his shirt, in a hotel bed.
There he was—holding a little girl with hair as light as her mother’s.

The room tilted. The air thickened, heavy as syrup.

Forty years.
Forty years of breakfasts, rare holidays together, endless business trips. Forty years in which I had trusted every word. I knew his habits, his favourite meals, his books. I thought I knew his soul.

But in these photographs he was someone else. Alive. Radiant. Laughing.
Not the weary man who came home to me, complaining of headaches and sleepless nights.

I couldn’t bear this truth alone. I had to show someone.

I called my son.
“Kiril, come. It’s urgent.”

He arrived within half an hour, hair dishevelled, jacket thrown over a T-shirt. To him, I was the fragile widow, broken with grief.
“Mum, what’s wrong? Are you ill?”

Wordlessly, I handed him the phone.

I watched his face change. First confusion, then disbelief, then disgust.
“This… what is this? A joke? Photoshop?”
“Look at the dates, Kiril. Just look.”

He scrolled. Folder after folder. “Madrid.” “Tokyo.” “Cairo.”

Everywhere there were women. Different ones. And always Dmitry. Laughing, embracing, kissing. Whispering promises.

“This can’t be…” Kiril’s voice cracked. “He loved you. He loved us.”

The word hung in the air. Loved?
Whom exactly? Me? Our family? Or each of those women who received the same phrases of devotion?

Inside me something turned to stone. The raw grief shifted into something else—cold, sharp, metallic. Curiosity.
I wanted to know everything.

I walked to his study. His sanctuary. A room always forbidden to me: “Don’t disturb my order.”
Kiril followed reluctantly, still clutching the phone as if it burned him.

We searched. Files, drawers, shelves. Too neat, too perfect. A stage set, not a lived-in office.

Then I saw the rug. The heavy Persian one, whose pattern I knew by heart. I knelt, lifted a corner. Kiril understood instantly, helped me. Beneath it, a floorboard slightly paler than the rest.

I pried it open.

Inside, velvet-lined, lay seven phones.

Arranged like specimens in a display case. Some old, some brand new. Each one—another life.

Kiril gave a strangled cry. I only stared.
Forty years I had not lived with a man, but with a creature who performed roles. I had been only one of his collections.

“Mum, stop,” Kiril whispered. “Let’s close it. Burn it. None of this matters now.”

“It matters to me,” I answered calmly. “I need to know who I spent forty years with.”

We charged the phones, one by one. Each buzzed back to life like a resurrected ghost.
And the flood came.

Messages. Photos. Videos. Dozens of women. Hundreds. He called each one “darling,” “kitten,” “my life.” He swore eternal love.

On one phone, I found a password-protected folder. Documents. I tried birthdays, anniversaries, car numbers. Nothing.

Kiril begged me to stop. But I couldn’t.

Then I remembered. In his wallet, he always kept a faded black-and-white photograph of a girl with braids. Not me. A “childhood friend,” he once said. I had believed him.

I typed her birthday.

The folder opened.

Inside were scanned passports, birth certificates, marriage papers.
Multiple names. Multiple identities.

He hadn’t just had affairs. He had wives. Families. Children.
Real ones. With official documents.

My blood froze. Dmitry Sergeyevich here, Dmitry Andreevich there. Different dates of birth. Different addresses.

“Mum…” Kiril whispered, white as chalk. “He… he had other families. We have brothers. Sisters.”

I couldn’t cry. Only emptiness.
Faces of neighbours and friends flickered in my mind—those to whom I had always boasted: “My husband is so loyal. He works so hard for us.” I had defended him. Laughed off hints about his constant travel.

And all the while, he was building homes. Lives. Legacies. Elsewhere.

Kiril trembled. “We must destroy this. If people find out—his reputation—our name—”

I laughed bitterly.
“Reputation? He mocked us all, and you want to protect his reputation?”

That night we opened everything. Phone after phone. Each revealed another performance. Another family. Another mask.

By dawn, I knew too much. Seven women. At least ten children.
One man. My husband.

I packed a bag.

“Mum, where are you going?” Kiril’s voice broke.
“To them,” I said simply.
“To them?! They’re strangers!”
“No. They are his children. My truth. I need to see them.”

The first was the blonde, “Sunshine.” The woman whose smile haunted the photos.

Her cottage was neat, flowers in the windows. She opened the door, froze when she saw me.
“Who are you?”
“I’m Dmitry’s wife.”

The silence stretched, suffocating. She turned pale, gripped the doorframe.
“That’s impossible. He told me he was a widower.”

“Now he is,” I replied coldly. “He’s in the grave.”

Her eyes widened. She staggered back.
“He… died?”

Before I could answer, a little girl rushed out. Fair-haired, pink dress, dimples in her cheeks. She hugged the woman’s legs.
“Mummy, who is this?”

I stared. She had Dmitry’s smile. Dmitry’s eyes.

I turned and walked away, unable to breathe. Behind me I heard sobs and a child’s questioning voice.

That was only the beginning.

Everywhere the pattern repeated: shock, tears, rage, denial. And children. Always children.

Each encounter tore me apart, yet piece by piece I assembled the mosaic.
Dmitry wasn’t a monster in the usual sense. He was an actor. A brilliant, tireless actor who played dozens of roles. And I—merely his audience.

When I returned home, Kiril waited.
“Well?” His voice was hoarse. “Did you find what you wanted?”

“I found the truth,” I said. “And it set me free.”

He shook his head, still clinging to the myth of his father. But I no longer cared.

Weeks later, I stood at Dmitry’s grave. The earth was still raw.
“You fooled us all,” I whispered. “But the play is over. I’m no longer your spectator. No longer your wife. To me, you’re only a stranger I once shared a house with.”

The wind swept dead leaves across the stones. My ties to him went with them.

At home, I opened the curtains wide for the first time in years. Sunlight flooded the room.

I began to live again. Small steps—conversations with neighbours, walks in the park, coffee with old friends. My son learned, slowly, to look at the world without his father’s shadow looming over him.

I never told outsiders the truth. It remained between us—a burden, but also a strange kind of liberation.

Sometimes I think of those other women, those children. I don’t hate them. They were deceived too. We were all actors in his endless play.

Half a year passed. I no longer felt like a widow, nor a betrayed wife. I felt like a woman reborn.

For the first time in forty years, when I looked into the mirror, I didn’t see someone’s wife. Someone’s shadow.

I saw myself.

And that was the beginning of my real life…………..Продолжение читайте в комментарии 👇👇👇",1,1757275728.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Well, maybe Micheal's is carrying it? Nope, and the website is impossible to navagate since it's spammed with random online only yarn spam; (at least one of which I've spent a few hours a month ago confirming was just selling yarn from alibaba and severely up charging it while claiming to be hand dyed)

Ebay? It's overpriced and not enough is listed in the colorway I need. I can't find anything on Etsy either. But hey while I'm on etsy maybe there's a dyer that's having a sale or severely under-charging? Nope, my collage student budget could never lol

I miss Joanns so badly. They always had decent colorways and good priced wool/wool blends. I definitely took it for-granted. Maybe Micheal's will feel the niche one day, but their in-store brand yarns always seemed to be so poor quality while K+C was genuinely great quality and had such nice colorways.

I'm looking to start an (under the table/donation-based) ""coffee shop"" on my porch for my very residential neighborhood and am looking for an affordable (relatively) set up somewhere between personal and commercial use. No space constraints specifically, but the smaller the better.

The dream is Linea Mini, but I don't have $7k to drop on this project! I came across this posting and it seems like a good deal based on my research, but wanted to ask around to make sure. I'd like something that can keep up and is sturdy, but if this venture fails, won't be a huge bother to use and store personally. In the opposite vein, if I love porch coffee, I would love a machine that can also level up if I want to actually turn it into a business not on my porch!

I haven't started doing this, so not sure the capacity needed/what kind of drinks I'll be pulling. Experience-wise, I worked in coffee years ago and ran a very small coffee shop in 2015-17 and have been an amateur since with access to La Marzoccos through a fancy office job since, but have no real technical machine fixing experience. 

I'm in New Orleans, Louisiana and the posting is from South Mississippi and I'm thinking of getting machine + grinder ($1100). I love my Fellow cups + kettle, but haven't used any of their grinders before. Thanks!!

1nb38ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1nb38ga/should_you_choose_kleenex_lotion_facial_tissues/,Should You Choose Kleenex Lotion Facial Tissues for Cold Season Comfort,"Testing out the Kleenex Lotion Facial Tissues, model 10036000559740, has seriously shifted my perspective on what a tissue could—and should—be. As someone who's frequently battling seasonal allergies, tissues have always been a necessary evil in my life. Imagine my surprise when I found a product that didn't just dry my nose, but actually made the whole process far more bearable. Here's a breakdown of my experience with these tissues.

**Softness Like No Other**  
If you've ever dreaded wiping your nose because you knew it would leave your skin irritated and sore, welcome to the club—I’ve been there too. These facial tissues felt incredibly soft, almost velvety against my skin, thanks to their infusion of coconut oil and aloe. Honestly, it seems like overkill for tissues at first, but once you use them, you’ll understand why the extra ‘lotiony’ touch feels like a lifesaver. Often, I’d blow my nose so many times throughout the day that it felt like sandpaper rubbing against raw skin. With these? No redness, no irritation.  

**Moisturizing Benefits**  
The 3-in-1 functionality of soothing, moisturizing, and protecting was evident to me almost instantly. I even tested this by setting them up for the worst-case scenario: a week-long cold during which I was sneezing every three minutes. Normally, by day two, I’d be breaking out the balm to deal with flakiness around my nose, but not this time. These tissues held up their end of the bargain, keeping my skin irritation-free. I also found them effective for wiping off makeup or cleaning small messes, which was an unexpected win.

**Durability That Impresses**  
Something else that left me pleasantly surprised was their strength. No one likes dealing with flimsy tissues that tear too easily or leave you with crumpled bits of paper on your face. These are 3-ply, which might sound like overkill but isn’t. They hold their structure well, even during a heavy-duty sneeze. Durable yet soft, they strike that rare balance usually missing in facial tissues. I even spilled coffee on the table and was able to mop it up effectively with just a few sheets, though I wouldn’t recommend relying on these as a substitute for paper towels.    

**Stylish and Functional Packaging**  
The boxes themselves caught me by surprise. Whoever thought tissues could double as a décor element? Kleenex delivered with various stylish designs that effortlessly fit into any room. I placed one each in my living room, bedroom, and kitchen, and instead of feeling like an eyesore, they actually added a decorative touch. They’re compact but still manage to fit a generous 180 sheets per box, so it feels like I’m not constantly running out.  

**Favorable Features**  
- Infused with coconut oil and aloe, making every usage a treat for the skin.  
- 3-ply durability ensures no tearing or thin, disappointing sheets.  
- Stylish packaging fits seamlessly into home décor without screaming “tissue box.”  

**Negative Attributes**  
- These are luxurious, but not everyone might want to invest in tissues priced at a premium.  
- It's worth mentioning they don’t biodegrade as quickly due to their thickness, which might deter eco-conscious buyers.  
- They’re great for allergies or colds but feel somewhat wasteful for light, everyday use.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing these to competitors like Puffs Plus Lotion or store-brand 3-ply tissues provided some interesting insights. While Puffs deliver a slightly softer sensation and arguably have a more established reputation, they fall short in durability. I’ve found Puffs tend to tear more often, especially with watery messes, whereas these Kleenex stood firm. Store brands, on the other hand, are usually less expensive but lack the same softness and moisturizing components. Another downside is that they often come in unappealing packaging, making them less desirable for display.

**Money's Worth**  
One of the biggest questions I often ask myself with everyday products like tissues is whether they’re worth the cost. Are these luxury tissues a necessity or just an indulgence? For someone who deals with frequent colds and allergic reactions—me—it feels like a justified investment. They offer more than just functionality; they elevate the entire experience. Families, especially those with kids prone to colds or runny noses, could also benefit greatly. Although if you're generally just using tissues sparingly, you might not see the added value.

So quick context for new readers: I (27M) met this woman (35F) at my gym. She told me she was going through a divorce, but after spending more time with her and listening to her stories, I started to realize a lot of it doesn’t add up. It became pretty clear she might just be lying about the “divorce” to cheat on her husband.

At first, I honestly couldn’t tell whether it was true or not because I’m inexperienced with this kind of stuff and didn’t realize some women use the “going through divorce” line as cover to cheat. We’ve worked out together, grabbed coffee, and she definitely crosses some lines with me emotionally, if not physically yet.

Here’s where my frustration comes in: I was telling one of my friends about the situation, and he basically told me she probably sees me as *simple minded*. He said she wouldn’t have risked lying to him about the divorce because he’s sharper and she’d know he’d call her out immediately. But with me, she might’ve thought I’d just believe her and go along.

For reference, I’m 5’9”, 160 lbs. I’m fit in the sense that I can lift a lot, but I don’t really *look* jacked. I admit I come across a little simple-minded sometimes because I’m more straightforward/naive. And yeah, I didn’t catch on right away that she was probably lying.

Now I feel insulted and I’m taking it personally. Like, if she really was trying to cheat, why me? There are so many other guys in the gym — bigger, louder, more experienced. But she chose to test me with this “divorce” line.

Am I overreacting for feeling like she targeted me because she thinks I’m the type of guy who’s easy to fool? Or is this just me being too sensitive about it?",1,1757275234.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Okay, a lot has happened within the past 48 hours, so bear with me. I don't know what to think about what has happened, just how awful it turned out. What had started as a simple investigation had quickly become a nightmarish scenario that will haunt me to the day I die, unable to not see the faces of the deceased and not feel guilt as the only three survivors of what the public is now calling the Amity disaster. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.

It was quiet that night after we had bolted everything down, save for the waves and imminent thunder on the horizon. It was pretty unlikely that anyone was going to get any sleep, and so we sat around and quietly talked, trying to take our minds off of what will inevitably happen. At some point, while the sun was starting it's way back into the sky, I was approached by Lawrence.

""You saved me back there, thank you,"" Lawrence said as he sat down next to me and Ellen, ""Again I...I'm sorry for the way I've been acting towards you two. Old habits really do die hard. That being said, there should be no excuse for my behaviour.""

""I appreciate you apologizing, just please don't stop trying to be a better person,"" Ellen replied, her words ringing out with sincerity, ""People change people, and people do change, just don't give up on yourself.""

I nodded in agreement with my wife, and we soon switched to other topics to talk about. We carried on, not knowing that this would be the last time I ever spoke with both of them. Unfortunately, however, it was only an hour later when the Amity was suddenly hit by an immense force that damaged the Amity's hull and sent the eleven of us scattering for cover. Shortly after, the object that hit us revealed itself to be Bruce's tail as it retracted out of the ship and rain began pouring inside.

""Shit, we've been breached!"" Dylan called out, grabbing a harpoon, ""All hands on deck, get to your battle stations!""

We all began to arm ourselves on our way to the deck of the ship ready to defend ourselves from the massive Dragon who was now looming overhead, his eyes filled with the same level of rage and contempt that I had seen the last time he was this close. The ship's guns were aimed directly at Bruce, ready to fire at a moment's notice. For a few moments, nobody moved after we got into position. Glancing around I can tell everyone was quite unnerved by this whole scenario. Sure, this crew had faced plenty of conflicts, from searching for rogue underwater mines to saving boats from wayward pirates. No one was truly prepared to come into contact with a Sea Dragon, since before this whole investigation began we didn't even know they existed. And none of us were prepared to fight one either, nevertheless we were willing to fight for the sake of ourselves and those back home. All to prevent Bruce from taking any more lives.

Little to no words were spoken throughout the ensuing fight against Bruce. Granted, it wasn't like there was much for any of us to say anyways, since the Dragon didn't seem like much of a talker. Rather, he let out a loud roar as he swung his massive tail at the Amity again. We were prepared this time, however, and started firing the guns at the beast in order to slow him down. While they did hit him, the ammunition didn't really do that much to stop the tail from smacking five crew-mates off of the deck. They didn't get the chance to hit the water before they were snatched out of the air in rapid succession by the serpent's massive jaws.

He then turned his attention to the ship's guns with a look of rage as he prepared his next attack, but it was far from what we expected. Instead of hitting the ship with his tail a third time, we watched in horror as Bruce's gills and mouth began to glow bright blue before a massive jet of boiling hot water blasted from his jaws and swiped right across the deck. With each thing it passed by, the jet proceeded to carve through like a hot knife through butter, causing serious damage. As I was at one of the guns that were hit, I was nearly close to finding out the hard way what would happen if it connected with living tissue before I was pushed out of the way just in the nick of time.

Much to my horror, I heard a loud thud behind me as my rescuer collapsed, having not been as lucky to move away from the blast in time. I braced myself and opened my eyes, only to let out a shriek upon seeing Matt's decapitated body limp next to me. There wasn't even any blood, as if the blast had cauterized where his head had been burned off. I then saw movement out of the corner of my eye, and looked up to see Tia standing above me, her hand covering her mouth. She didn't say anything, but the horrified look of grief in her eyes was more than enough to suggest that she had just witnessed her fiance die right in front of her. There were tears in her eyes as she fell to her knees and let out a cry of anguish while holding Matt's corpse. I then watched as, through the howling winds and roars of thunder, the tears of anguish slowly morphed into snarls of rage before she slowly stood up, ran towards the edge of the Amity and dived straight into the chaotic water. A second had barely passed after she hit the water before the sounds of the hurricane were dwarfed by a beastly roar so loud that it caused everyone onboard to hold their ears in pain, before another Sea Dragon of similar size to Bruce rose out of the ocean.

I find it difficult to completely explain what happened next, for right after Tia rose back out of the water she immediately turned her attention towards Bruce and everything descended into chaos.If it wasn't bad enough to be attacked by a giant monster in the middle of a storm in the middle of the ocean, the Amity had now found itself caught in the middle of a fight between two mythical beasts. Having worked in my career as long as I have, I've been caught in the middle of fights between marine life before. I've seen hammerheads fighting a pack of dolphins, witnessed a whale fighting off a giant squid. All of those scenarios made me feel relatively small, but in comparison to the two Dragons battling it out in the hurricane, the crew of the Amity might as well have been ants. Our attacks on Bruce had already proven practically useless, and now the most we could do is take cover and hope to not get caught in the crossfire.

Needless to say, that was easier said than done, and those 48 hours were filled with several casualties. Tragically, my wife's uncle was eventually counted among the dead by the time everything was over. Ellen was nearly struck in the head by a life boat knocked loose by another slap on the ship by Bruce's tail, which would've snapped her neck and killed her instantly if Dylan hadn't pulled her out of the way in time. Dylan wasn't so lucky (if I can even call it that), for another blast of boiling water had left his bisected corpse falling into the water. Death after death, life taken after life taken. I knew every single person on that ship, with some even having a personal connection with. Before this investigation had began, I could recognize all of their faces. Now, as I'm typing this, their faces are all I can see, along with images in my mind of their dead bodies.

At some point, I can't remember when, another hit to the boat had tore open the hull on the bottom, causing the Amity to slowly start to sink. What I didn't notice, however, but Lawrence had noticed, is that the same hit had opened up the chamber where the Amity was keeping its torpedoes. They were on board and rarely used, with Dylan having previously told me that they were only to be used if another ship were to attack us.

""How powerful are these?"" I just barely heard him ask over the roaring of the two Dragons and the now dying down thunder as the hurricane passed us over.

I looked him dead in the eyes, catching on to what he was thinking as I replied, ""Just one is enough to sink a battleship.""

With a nod to each other, the three of us swiftly ran to the chamber and together picked up a torpedo and went to load it, only to find ourselves with a problem. In the midst of the fighting, one of the water blasts had melted the metal on the launcher, effectively welding it shut.

I began to get a sinking feeling as a dark look formed in the representative's eyes as he said, ""Whatever happens next, get to the turret and shoot the torpedo once he's got it in his teeth.""

""Larry, don't you dare-""

""Just fucking do it! Don't worry about me!"" He cut off Ellen's protest, before he dragged the torpedo out of the gun chamber on his own and managed to get on deck with it and used some nearby rope to tie it to himself.

Before we could say anything else, Lawrence began shouting and waving his arms to get Bruce's attention. At this point Tia wasn't in sight, and I had no idea if she was alive or not in that very moment. With her not fighting him, however, that gave the beast time to turn his attention to us. The Sea Dragon was staring at Lawrence running around on the deck of the sinking ship, reminding me of a snake staring down a mouse about to become its next meal. It didn't take long for the serpentine sea monster to slowly pull back and coil into himself before his massive head launched forward, and the last time I saw Lawrence alive was him giving me a thumbs up seconds before he disappeared completely behind the rows of enormous teeth.

I wanted to scream, cry, or throw up, or some mix of all three. Ellen meanwhile was looking pretty pale from what we had just witnessed. Before this investigation had begun there were fifteen people on the Amity, and over the course of this endeavour we had witnessed the deaths of almost every single person I had either known personally or had even also grown up with. And now, with Tia's fate unknown to me at that moment, I had just witnessed Lawrence - who for the longest time I had considered a jerk but over the course of this trip proved that he was wanting to and willing to try to be a better person - intentionally sacrifice himself in order to give me a chance to kill the monster responsible for his death and that of everyone else.

But I couldn't do that, I couldn't give up now. Not when I could see the torpedo was lodged in Bruce's mouth. Knowing what we had to do, Ellen went to prepare the same lifeboat that nearly killed her before while I booked it back to where the firearms were kept and grabbed a rifle, having to push through gushing sea water as I did. Thankfully the gun was dry and didn't suffer any water damage, but I didn't have time to worry about that as I booked it back on deck just to see Bruce lunging towards Ellen, jaw open wide. Just then, Tia lunged back out of the water and latched onto the other Sea Dragon by the nape of his neck, yanking him back into the water to continue the fight.

*Don't you dare hesitate, I'll keep him in place!* I heard Tia's voice in my head as out loud she snarled.

Snapping out of my fear, I waded through the water as swiftly as possible and began climbing up to the crow's nest. As soon as I reached the nest I held on tight to the guard rail and loaded a bullet into the rifle. Lifting it up to my shoulder and looking down the scope, I found myself constantly adjusting my aim in order to keep up with the battle. With Tia and Bruce constantly thrashing around in the water, locking onto the spot on the torpedo where I knew its trigger would be was proving to be quite difficult much to my frustration. It was right there in his teeth but with their fight he kept opening and closing his mouth.

""Oh fuck's sake smile you son of a-"" I exclaimed and, acting quickly the second I had a long enough opening, put the torpedo' dead in my sights and pulled the trigger.

For a moment, there was silence, leaving me unsure about whether or not I'd hit the torpedo at all. Then came a flash of fire and light followed by the sound of a large explosion. I ended up covering my eyes so as to shield them from debris, and when I looked back there were massive chunks of flesh floating in the water where Bruce had been moments ago. Finally, after days of being hunted by the Sea Dragon and nearly being eaten by him twice, he was finally dead.

That didn't mean our troubles were over, however. There we were, floating in the open water surrounded by the bodies of close friends and family along with what was left of the beast. Tia checked on us a few times to make sure we were still alive, but it was a while before I was rested just enough to reply with noise instead of just my eyes. I have no idea how long we floated there, or at what point Tia decided to shift into her human form and pull me onto the lifeboat. Oddly enough, by this point I felt completely rejuvenated. Even as the sun rose and set twice before other Canadian Coast Guard ships arrived to rescue any survivors, I didn't feel tired, or hungry or thirsty at all. If anything, I was both relieved that it was finally over, and mourning for the people who were lost in our fight against Bruce, with my wife and uncle-in-law among the deceased.

In fact, I didn't even notice the fact that something still wasn't quite right until we finally reached the shores of Halifax and climbed back onto dry land. I looked down with surprise upon realizing that my leg, which had been broken 48 hours prior, was now perfectly healed like nothing had happened. Even as someone like myself who's a little different, broken bones usually take 3-6 months to heal, not two days. Ellen and I exchanged glances and shrugged, unsure of what to make of it. We didn't find a possible answer until my conversation with my family doctor, who gave me a checkup a day later.

""How odd indeed,"" the doctor said as he glanced over his notes, ""Psychologically you're a mess, and yet physically you're in good health. Even with your unique physiology, the injuries you'd described as getting realistically should still be here. There is something we did find, however.""

Hesitantly, I asked, ""What did you find?""

The doctor held up a bag containing what looked like a bloodied scale as he replied, ""This is what we pulled out of your arm. We were able to identify your blood on it, but there's another source of what appears to be blood on it that matches what was found on the remains of the entity you killed. This same substance has also been found in your bloodstream. Whatever that beast was, we think that's what caused your body to recover so quickly.""

""...Is it possible to remove it?""

""Afraid not,"" he solemnly stated, ""Usually with blood transfusions there's a risk of your body rejecting the donated blood, but you're not showing any signs of that. Plus the blood has already had plenty of time to integrate into your own, so I don't think it's going anywhere. I wish it made sense as much as you probably do, but that's the situation.""

So now I'm back at home typing this out, completely unsure of how to feel about everything. I've been trying to get sleep but I keep seeing their faces whenever I close my eyes. Ellen and I have been going to therapy sessions about what happened, but it hasn't been easy, especially with her uncle gone. I'm thankful that after the investigation and the funeral I was able to keep a pair of urns filled with Dylan's ashes. Now they sit on our coffee table, a reminder of those that were lost but won't be forgotten. When this investigation started, I had questions about the man eater we were hunting in order to stop the attacks. Now, that monster's blood runs through my veins and almost everyone I know personally is gone, leaving me with so much trauma to process and more questions than answers.",1,1757275217.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1nb35w3,https://i.redd.it/c4jfga38tsnf1.jpeg,San Francisco vs. Prague: Why it sometimes feels like suffering in SF,"Hey fellow redditors,

I’m spending a month living and working in San Francisco, and so far it’s been a super stimulating experience. 
Honestly, I’d even call it the most livable city in the U.S. But since I’m more used to the European lifestyle, I can’t help but compare and let’s just say Prague (and Eastern Europe in general Warsaw, Bratislava, Vienna, etc.) is winning heavily in my book.

That said, I’d love to hear the other side: what do you love about living in SF compared to Europe? Feel free to defend your city!

Here are some differences I’ve noticed:

1. Takeaway coffee In Europe, this really isn’t a thing. Sure, you can get it, but hardly anyone does. We drink espresso, cappuccino, maybe espresso lungo. And we sit in cafés, sometimes for hours.

2. Coffee culture – Coffee isn’t about caffeine, it’s about connection. It’s more like a cigarette break: you sit down, talk, and socialize.
Small talk – People here are way more open to small talk. Back home, not so much.

3. Eye contact – In Prague, people constantly scan their surroundings and make brief eye contact, maybe even a small smile. In SF, everyone seems more in their own world.

4. Parks – I noticed people often sit alone and enjoy their time. In Europe, if you’re alone in a park, people see you as super approachable. Here it feels like the opposite.

5. Tipping culture – We usually don’t tip, or maybe just round up by 10–50 cents. And every café/restaurant has table service included. In SF, every terminal starts at 15% and counter-service tipping feels unavoidable. (This trend is slowly creeping into Europe too, though.)

6. Coworking vibes – In Europe, if you grab a coffee in a coworking space, it’s normal to chat and meet people. Here, people sit right in front of the barista… and keep working.

7. Wine prices – Can someone explain this? $20 for a glass of prosecco + tip?? That’s like 5 bottles in Europe — or 2 very good ones.

8. Queues everywhere – In SF, if a place is good, there’s a line. In Prague, we have thousands of amazing spots and people just spread out. No queues.

9. Groceries & infrastructure – Grocery stores feel far apart and not well distributed. In Europe, we’re used to shiny, clean, spacious supermarkets almost on every corner.

10. Running & dogs – Huge plus though: people here run a lot and have dogs. I love that.

Bonus: Olive oil spray with 0 calories, 0 fat, 0 protein, 0 carbs… what even is that? :D",6,1757275148.0,bayarea,4,0.69,False

1nb2zu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nb2zu0/motivation_or_a_system_what_works_for_you_long_one/,Motivation or a system — what works for you? Long one.,"# Hi everyone!

When I started making my first game, I thought motivation would last me all the way to release. Spoiler: it ran out much sooner. This is especially familiar to those working solo or in small teams. Below is the system that replaced my motivation and carried the project to the finish line.

I'll share **my perspective** on what helps developers in the long run. Let me say right away: **my opinion might differ from the advice in books or videos about ""successful success.**"" This article is for beginners like me, based on personal experience with trial and error.

# The main thesis: Motivation is a great start, but it won't get you to the finish line.

Of course, motivation is important. It's the impulse, the spark that gets us to act. But let's be honest: you won't get far on impulse alone.

I'm sure everyone has been in this situation: *It's 2 AM, and you can't sleep, tossing and turning. The evening before, you watched an interesting video about a successful person, about business, or about the making of your favorite game. Maybe you met up with someone and discussed all sorts of exciting projects. And then, a brilliant idea hits you. You think it over for another two hours; now it's 4 AM. The idea is perfect. You have a clear plan in your head, and you're filled with determination. Exhausted, you finally fall asleep…*

What do you tell yourself when you wake up in the morning? The impulse was there, you were burning with desire to do it. It was a billion-dollar idea. I don't judge; I share your burden. We'll all say the same thing together: ""Not today."" Oof, you were so motivated last night, so where did this worm of doubt come from this morning?

Okay, let's say you're not one of those people. You started making your game on pure motivation. You even built the first prototype. What will happen to your motivation when:

* You find out that 90% of games on Steam don't make any significant income?
* You compare your art/code/design to the work of experienced colleagues?
* You share your idea with someone, and they laugh or respond with skepticism?
* The Silksong gets released?

Huh? Still full of enthusiasm? Alright. What motivation will help you get through the weeks and months of performing the 90% of routine, boring tasks that make up game development? Drawing the hundredth version of an icon, fixing minor bugs, optimizing code? If you're still riding high, my respects to you.

Okay, so you've made it to creating a Steam page. You spent two days preparing screenshots and a description. And in the first week, you get 2 wishlists. Is your motivation still with you? Honestly, I would have given up that first morning after the sleepless night.

# So what do you do if motivation is such an unreliable ally?

Other words come to the rescue: **persistence, discipline, and a system.**

It's easy to throw around big words. But how do you apply this in practice? The only way I understand to reach a distant goal (like releasing a game) when the path leads through routine, failure, self-doubt, broken glass, and hot coals - is to build a system. A system that will push you forward every day - a little bit at a time, but inevitably\*\*. Not just on the days you\*\* ***want*** **to move, but also on the days you feel too lazy to even lie down.**

Below are specific steps and tools that I used. This isn't dogma, but an example of a system you can adapt for yourself. I'm going to skip the advice like ""believe in yourself"" or ""don't be afraid of criticism."" We're just going to *do* things. Basic things.

# Step 1: Define the Scope (See the Whole Mountain)

Write a small spec for yourself. Just kidding, don't write a spec - that's boring. Open Miro and sketch out the structure of your game. In broad strokes, list all the key elements without which your game won't be a game. Not the bells and whistles, but the bare minimum (MVP). This is your work map, the foundation for everything else. Here's an example:

[https://imgur.com/a/VmGJoAF](https://imgur.com/a/VmGJoAF)

# Step 2: Task Tracker and Decomposition (Break the Mountain into Stones)

Take your map from Miro and transfer it to a task tracker. Any simple tool like Trello, YouGile, or something with a ""board"" will do. First, just copy the major blocks. Then, start the decomposition: break down each large task into the smallest, most specific steps possible. ""Make a character"" becomes ""Draw walk sprite,"" ""Write movement code,"" ""Add attack animation,"" etc. Any given task shouldn't take more than your workday, and ideally, up to two hours. For example (Sorry, its in russian (im from eastern Europe). I don't have a board in english, but you'll get the message):

[https://imgur.com/a/dRAp5Hf](https://imgur.com/a/dRAp5Hf)

# Step 3: Prioritization (Choose the Most Important Stones)

This is a critically important stage that saves you from getting scattered and adding unnecessary features (like a jetpack for Sisyphus in the first location). With a jetpack, Sisyphus would be cool, but there would be no game. Don't overcomplicate things; divide all tasks in your tracker into two types:

* **Highest Priority:** All tasks from your initial MVP map and their decompositions. This is what the game cannot exist without.
* **Low Priority:** Everything else - improvements, extra features, ""nice-to-haves.""

The rule is simple: **first, you ONLY do the highest-priority tasks.** You move on to low-priority tasks only when all the essential work is done. Or (a small concession) spend no more than 10-15% of your week on the ""nice-to-haves"" to treat yourself a little.

# Step 4: Calendar (Schedule Your Climbing Time)

Don't work ""based on mood"" or ""when you have time."" Create a schedule. Plan specific time slots for working on the game and try to stick to them. For example: ""Tuesday, 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM - Work on dialogues.""

* **The ""one thing at a time"" principle:** Don't try to code for 15 minutes, draw for 15 minutes, and write music for 15 minutes. Context switching consumes a lot of energy. Dedicate blocks of time to similar types of tasks.
* **Weekly planning:** At the beginning of the week, add tasks to your tracker in batches and adjust their priorities.

[https://imgur.com/a/qYmJKcG](https://imgur.com/a/qYmJKcG)

# Step 5: Workspace (Prepare Your Gear)

Organize a space for work. Not on the couch, not with the TV noise in the background. Ideally, a desk with nothing on it but your device. The basic goal is to eliminate distractions:

* Phone on silent mode and far away.
* No shortcuts to games, social media, or whatever else you find interesting on your computer desktop.
* All notifications (messengers, email) turned off during work time.

A single message from a friend can kill an hour of work, if not the whole day (or even two, if you don't handle hangovers well).

# Rules of the System (To Make It Work):

* **Regularly update the task tracker:** New ideas, bugs you find - everything goes in there immediately. It should never be empty.
* **Start your workday with the task tracker:** See what needs to be done today.
* **Complete at least one task every ""workday.""** Even the smallest one, for 5 minutes. The main thing is to take a step forward.

# How to Tell If Your System Isn't Working:

* You don't open your task tracker every workday.
* You make no effort to follow your own schedule.

# What Does This System Give You?

Yes, all the fun is gone. Yes, it's now like going to a job. Yes, it's a marathon, not a sprint. If you do this, you will definitely finish what you started. Slowly, monotonously, sipping coffee along the way, but you will finish. If you have a day job, no problem. Just adjust the schedule to fit your life, but keep the principle the same. In return, you will get:

* **Clarity:** You always know what you're doing and why. No more empty pondering.
* **Reduced Procrastination:** You don't have to think about what to do - the task is already in the tracker. Just grab the one with the highest priority.
* **Overcoming Inertia:** Don't feel like working? Grab the smallest task, even for 10 minutes. Just do it. The trick isn't even in the completed task. Everyone knows the hardest part isn't the work itself - it's *sitting down* to start.
* **Constant Progress:** Small steps every day inevitably lead to the goal (and you can always look at your list of completed tasks and enjoy how awesome you are).

# Conclusion:

Now, you don't need motivation as much as you need the **discipline to follow your own system.** The system takes on some of the willpower burden. It helps you move forward with almost robotic certainty.

And, for the love of all that is holy, **set a deadline** \- even a marathon has a finish line, and running it for three years is not much of an achievement.

And what about you? Do you rely more on motivation, or do you have your own system that helps you see a project through to the end?

Good day and thank you for attention!

Hello Lancashire Reddit, 

I've been back in the county for a year since graduating uni and one of the things that's made living here again quite good has been the local community, specifically a group in burnely who like to do wargaming every saturday at the coffee mill in burnley. there's your classic warhammer 40k, age of sigmar, horus heresy and there's talks of people trying out bloodbowl

from other nerdy hobbies i picked up that lancashire has quite the wargaming scene a few years ago in colne until a store shut down so i figured i should share this community around and let people know that throwing dice around and spending absurd amounts of money on tiny plastic figures is still going strong.

if anyone else is intrested, here's a link to their discord [https://discord.gg/QmXxy8v5](https://discord.gg/QmXxy8v5) ",2,1757274752.0,lancashire,0,1.0,False

1nb2xap,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nb2xap,"20 Fruits, Vegetables and Plants Native To Africa","**1 Cotton:** (CottonGossypium herbaceum) is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure cellulose, and can contain minor percentages of waxes, fats, pectins, and water. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds. The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable, and durable textile. 

**2 Ebony African Wood:** is a dense black/brown hardwood, coming from several species in the genus Diospyros, which also includes the persimmon tree. A few Diospyros species, such as macassar and mun ebony, are dense enough to sink in water. Ebony is finely textured and has a mirror finish when polished, making it valuable as an ornamental wood.[1] It is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world at $100 - $300 per board foot. Ebony has a long history of use, and carved pieces have been found in Ancient Egyptian tombs. 

**3 Castor beans:** are the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses. The seeds contain between 40% and 60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein. The seed also contains ricin, a highly potent water-soluble toxin. Castor oil is commonly used as a moisturizer in skin and hair products for people of African descent. 

**4 Coffee:** The story of how goats discovered coffee is an Ethiopian legend about a goat herder named Kaldi. He noticed his goats became extraordinarily energetic and started ""dancing"" after eating the red berries from a certain bush. Kaldi tried the berries himself and felt a similar jolt of energy. He shared this discovery with a local monastery, where the monks initially rejected the berries but later found that the roasted beans, when brewed, helped them stay awake during their nightly devotions, leading to the birth of coffee.

**5 Shea Nut:** Shea butter baby, A shea nut is the seed of the shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa), an indigenous African tree, from which shea butter is extracted. This fat is widely used in cosmetics for its moisturizing properties and in food products like chocolate as a cocoa butter substitute. While technically a seed, it is considered a tree nut by the FDA and is often listed on food labels due to its protein content.

**6 Tamarind:** is the sweet-and-sour, tangy pulp from the pod of the tamarind tree, a tropical leguminous tree native to Africa. The fruit is a staple in many cuisines. It’s thought that Africans and Asians had been engaging in trade for centuries to millenia since Tamarind is commonly found in Asia as well but is originates from Africa. 

Rich in Nutrients: Tamarind is a good source of fiber, antioxidants, and minerals like calcium and magnesium. 

Polyphenols: Contains polyphenols, which act as antioxidants in the body. 

Dry Eye Relief: Some evidence suggests that tamarind extract in eye drops can help relieve symptoms of dry eye

**7 Okra:** Known in some English-speaking countries as lady's fingers, is a flowering plant in the mallow family native to East Africa. Cultivated in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions around the world for its edible green seed pods, okra is used in the cuisines of many countries. Providing good nutrition, Okra is rich in vitamins, minerals and disease-fighting nutrients. May boost heart health. May help manage blood sugar, benefits gastrointestinal health and strengthens bones

**8 Baobab fruit:** ""Tree of Life"" considered a “Superfood” Baobab fruit is a large, nutrient-dense fruit from the Adansonia tree native to Africa, Madagascar, and Australia, known for its high concentration of Vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants. The fruit contains a dry, powdery pulp that is often consumed as a powdered supplement, prized for its citrus-like flavor and potential benefits for digestion, immunity, and energy levels. May Aid Weight Loss by Promoting Feelings of Fullness. Antioxidant and Polyphenol Content May Reduce Inflammation

**9 Dates:** Are rich in strong antioxidants such as flavonoids, carotenoids, and phenolic acid. The antioxidants protect your cells from free radical damage, reduce inflammation, and combat stress in your body. Including dates in your diet means providing your body with a natural shield against aging and chronic illnesses.

**10 Plantains:** A plantain is a large, tropical fruit from the banana family, characterized by a thick skin and high starch content, making it a starchy vegetable rather than a sweet fruit. Unlike bananas, plantains are rarely eaten raw; instead, they are cooked in various ways and are a staple food in African, Caribbean, and Latin American cuisines. They can be enjoyed at different stages of ripeness, with green plantains being firmer and used for savory dishes, while yellow or brown-skinned plantains are sweeter and suitable for desserts or sweet dishes

**11 Mango:** Consumers had significantly higher daily intakes of dietary fiber, magnesium, potassium, folate, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E and significantly lower intakes of added sugar and cholesterol, compared with non-consumers.

**12 Ackee:** is the national fruit of Jamaica, native to West Africa, and is known for its edible, soft, yellow flesh (arils) that surrounds large, black seeds. The fruit is considered toxic when unripe or if the black seeds are not properly removed, as they contain high levels of hypoglycin A and B. When prepared correctly, the flesh has a creamy texture, similar to scrambled eggs, 

**13 Watermelon:** evidence suggests that regularly eating watermelon promotes good health and may reduce your risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and cancer. This is likely thanks, in part, to its antioxidants, which help protect your body from stress and prevent or slow cell damage

**14 Cantaloupe:** Is a sweet, juicy muskmelon with an orange flesh and a netted rind, known for its high water content, fiber, and vitamins, making it a good choice for hydration and nutrition. For the record Honey Dew Melon is also from Africa, it just didn’t fit on the list. 

**15 Breadfruit:** Roasted breadfruit has a unique and delightful taste that can vary depending on its ripeness. When roasted, breadfruit's starchy flesh becomes tender, creamy, and slightly sweet, with a subtly nutty flavour. Its texture is denser and richer than a well-cooked potato, making it a satisfying and versatile dish.

**16 Palm Nut:** In West Africa, palm nuts are primarily used to create a rich, flavorful soup known by various names like banga, abenkwan, or sauce gra, which serves as the base for dishes alongside meats, fish, and starches. The palm fruit is pounded to extract a creamy juice and oil, forming the thick, vibrant soup that is a staple in the cuisine of countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast. The extracted palm oil is also used for cooking due to its unique flavor, color, richness, and high smoking point, making it suitable for frying

Composed of 16% fiber, palm kernel cake also has a high phosphorus-to-calcium ratio and contains such essential elements as magnesium, iron, and zinc.

**17 Basil:** Is a tender, aromatic culinary and medicinal herb in the mint family, originating from tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is widely used in Italian, Mediterranean, and Thai cuisines for its distinct flavor, famously as the base for pesto.

**18 Ashwagandha:** Is an ancient medicinal herb with various possible health benefits. Study findings suggest that it may help reduce anxiety and stress, support restful sleep, and even improve cognitive functioning in certain populations. 

**19 Yams:** Are starchy, edible tubers from the Dioscorea genus of herbaceous vines, native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas, with a tough, bark-like skin and white, yellow, or purple flesh, and are less sweet and starchier than sweet potatoes, 

**20 Sorghum:** Originally from Africa, and first arrived on Southern American tables as an ingredient in molasses. It is chock full of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, but no gluten. Each half-cup has 10 grams of protein, which makes it both nutritious and filling.

I found out about her upcoming marriage and the timeline of her relationship possibly conflicting with our relationship. And quite honestly? I don't blame her. I failed as a husband in many ways. I also took part in emotional affairs and would have cheated if they initiated. Game is game.  
  
I used my Dexter level of investigation skills to find pictures of her and her partner. And it was just what I needed. I never wanted her back but the emotion that I felt is something that I cannot explain. I'm not even sure if there's a word in the dictionary for what I felt. As I flipped through the dozen or so pictures of them, I realized that this is someone else, for better or for worse. She's a horror film fan now, apparently. I never saw that coming.  
  
Throughout our 10 years, I feared more than death seeing her in the arms of another man. But to see it in a way so permanent and so public has set me free. The worst happened and now it's over. And it wasn't even nearly as bad as I thought. I have pretty much been mentally training for this for the past 3 years. I just had to see it with my own eyes.  
  
It was a crazy week and I cried very briefly several times but I finding that I am thinking about her less and less. I can feel my big heart returning. I am a lot more open and affectionate with people. I think I smile a bit bigger. I am liking what I am seeing from myself. I am finally introducing myself to my neighbors after living next to some of them for 6 years. I have been healing for a long time but I feel as if this is the final step.   
  
My body is naturally waking up at 5:00 a.m. and not in the bad way. I go on morning runs and sit in the hot tub in the morning without music or some podcast blasting in my ear. Just feeling the world around me, laying my head on the cold stone while my body is in the hot water. I get my morning coffee in and a Spotify music jam session with my fiancée all before 8 am!

This is exploitation. This is violence. The dairy industry is a machine of cruelty—turning mothers into tools and life into profit.

But honestly, the event affected me more than i would've thought.

In Adelaide, otw home from university, I was in a busy suburb and there a lot of the ""middle class"" live, where some people act arrogant and kind of assholes. I came off the bus into the suburb, tired from a long-ass day from uni, and decided to go to a Cafe for a coffee.

I had to cross the road to get to said cafe, and knowing how the traffic was, I used one of those small pedestrian crossings that usually only one lane and are for drivers turning the corner. I waited for a few cars to drive past, before soon thinking it was safe to cross; me keeping an eye on the incoming cars heading towards me.

A car did come my way, but knowing I had right of way, I crossed, thinking that the car coming my way would fkn stop.

Welp, I was wrong.

The car didn't plan on stopping, and had to slam on the brakes and blare the horn so he didn't hit me. He stopped a foot away from me, and I immediately turned to the car and saw how annoyed the man was.

Still in the middle of the crossing, I knew up my arms, thinking, ""wtf you doing?"" at the guy before crossing. After reaching the footpath, I immediately got overwhelmed, dropping my laptop on the footpath; heart racing as I had to catch my breath.

After that, I was in borderline tears. I hadn't been on an accident in a long time; too long for me to remember. I guess I was just relieved I wasn't hit, but the shock of it almost happening was a lot.

I was probably overreacting, but my anxiety pills weren't working much that day, lol.

Anyways, yeah. After that, went to the cafe, went home and slept for 12hrs.

I think this both a work and friendship question. My first language is not english, I'm sorry for it.

In my workplace there is this group for people that every couple days make a plan to go to eat something, order some coffee or sweets through delivery and I never get invited; the reason why I get mad about that it's because where are in the same work-group so we have to interact with each other always. These people are not strangers for me, we talk about other things besides work, joke and I have know them (in work) for two years.

Every time they are making a plan to do one thing I feel really bad because I don't know why they no include me. There was one these times one for them asked if I was going too and the response of the other person was that I never have money but I had, I always have the money for it and there has not been a moment they asked me and I said no (because they never ask me). There have been many times one of these people tell me for example ""on friday X is going to invite us to this place"" this is a joke because everyone pays for his food but when the days comes they leave without me.

I feel bad for this not only for not getting invited but because I don't want to get mad to them. I thought I was not getting invited because besides I know them for two years I only have 5 months working in the same group, but a couple months ago a new person arrives and they immediately include them on their plans. I like talking to this new person and we have a lot in common and that's why I don't like to envy them.

I know the fact that this is getting me mad is my fault but it is difficult for me not only making friends but talking to people. My only two friends live on others countries and we don't talk to much. I told my brother about this and he said to me that I don't go to work to make friends and I only need to be grateful to getting paid every month.

I’m 21, working part-time retail (mostly backroom shifts). Last year, I self-admitted to the hospital during what I believe was a manic episode. I was using heavy weed edibles at the time and drinking a ton of caffeine. I hadn’t slept properly in days and just spun out completely.

They told me I might have bipolar traits, but I don’t remember a full diagnosis. I was prescribed meds, didn’t stick with them. I stopped using weed for a bit after that—but started smoking again around November during a depressive episode, and it’s been daily since. Mostly high-strength concentrates. I also drink 5 or more coffees every day. I know I’m overstimulated, under-rested, and constantly in some kind of self-medicated survival loop.

I’m not in school. I’ve just been working and trying to keep it together. I’ve avoided customer-facing roles like cash because I don’t feel mentally stable enough to handle them. I also have scoliosis, and the physical warehouse work adds another layer of stress. I’ve hit a point where I’m foggy, impulsive, emotionally unstable, and genuinely scared that I might make a decision I can’t take back.

I haven’t taken a medical leave yet—but I think I need to. I feel like I’m about to snap. I want to stop smoking, cut the caffeine, and finally get clarity on what’s going on with my mental health. I just don’t know how to do it. I’ve never taken leave before and I don’t even know what to say to a doctor.

Shorter versio:, a used pre-cat Hearthstone Heritage came up on the town listserve for $800. Seems like a decent deal.  It would fit in very nicely with a granite backing on the hearth and actually sitting on a soapstone hearth. I could use a bit more BTUs in the coldest weather.

Been using a Jotul 3cB for a bit over a decade, rebuilt it maybe 5 or 6 years ago. I bought it used about a dozen or 13 years ago. The Jotul is in overall good shape, but it gets a bit hard to control in the coldest weather. I don’t know if it’s extra leaky, or if it’s just the design, which doesn’t allow for an extremely small amount of airflow. Got a good tall brick chimney with stainless steel liner. When everything is hot and the air is very cold, it is a race car, zooming toward getting very hot. I have to be careful not to put too much wood in it in very cold weather when it’s pulling hard. I burn firewood as dry as can be, try to cut it two years ahead.

Use pattern: We’re in an 1860 one room school house (with an addition, which we don’t heat much). Stove is in the 28 x 28 one room, with 80s retrofit (pretty crappy insulation) and lots of windows. Also with a 15k mini split. 

Since getting the mini split, stove use is a bit different. I never wanted a very big stove, since I didn’t want to smolder it during shoulder seasons. Now, the mini split carries the shoulder seasons. The stove carries the big load in very cold weather, where the mini split isn’t enough.

Between needing a lot of heat in the coldest weather and the Jotul tending to take off into danger zone if I don’t watch it, I’m afraid of overfiring and ruining the Jotul. Still OK now, but I don’t want to wreck it.

Biggest problem with the hearthstone in my book is that we tend to let this room cool overnight, let the mini split hold up the bottom at about 62 to 65 degrees and then at breakfast bring it right up with the woodstove. From what I hear the Hearthstone would be slow to warm when we want it to be warm for breakfast. Also, I’ve read of some durability issues, latches and hinges.

Who knows, maybe the old hearthstone would also tend to take off in cold weather. Sounds like the new ones are super tight and slow, but this is an older one.",1,1757273959.0,woodstoving,0,1.0,False

Acquaintance & Friend is different, it's fine to have acquaintances of opposite sex but not friends [more details in the description]. Let's have a discussion on this","I think many people do not know the differences between acquaintances and friends, hence you think acquaintanceship (like your friendly classmates and colleagues) equals to friendship and come to the conclusion that friendship with opposite sex is permissible. Yes acquaintances are friendly people, but being friendly with someone does not mean they are your friends. there are some clear differences between acquaintances and friends. Having acquaintances of opposite sex is allowed, but having friends is not.

Let me start the discussion by stating the differences between an acquaintance and a friend first:

Acquaintance
-

>**Meaning:** Someone you know, but you don’t share a deep personal bond with. Interaction is limited, usually situational.

>**Characteristics:**

>* You talk when needed (class, project, group work).

>* Relationship is polite but not personal.

>* You don’t usually share secrets or personal struggles.



>**Example:**

>* You sit next to a classmate in math class. You say hello, borrow a pen, or discuss homework. That person is your acquaintance.

>* You work together on a semester group project. You exchange messages about deadlines but don’t hang out socially. That’s an acquaintance.

>* After you win a science fair, a classmate you rarely talk to might just clap or say “Well done!” and move on.

>* If you score highest on an exam, your project partner might text “Congrats” in the group chat, but that’s it.

>* Hanging out/tour usually doesn’t happen much unless it’s a big group event (class trip, project outing, college fest). If you do go together, it’s more about being part of the same circle, not because of personal closeness. Conversation stays light and formal (class, assignments, “How are you?”), like

>>* You go on a school tour, and an acquaintance might sit near you on the bus and chat a bit, but once the trip ends, you don’t really stay in touch.

>>* During a department tour, you click pictures together with acquaintances because everyone else is doing it, but you don’t meet them again outside class.



Friend
-

>**Meaning:** Someone you have a personal, emotional, and trusting connection with.

>**Characteristics:**

>* You spend time together beyond necessity (eat lunch, hang out after class).

>* You share personal experiences, worries, and achievements.

>* They are supportive in good and bad times.



>**Example:**

>* A classmate you eat lunch with every day, walk home together, and call when you’re upset. That’s a friend.

>* A classmate who becomes your roommate, studies late nights with you, goes to movies, and helps you during tough times. That’s a friend.

>* If you score the winning goal in a football match, your friend runs onto the field, cheers loudly, maybe hugs you.

>* If you land an internship, your close friend might take you out for coffee to celebrate, post about it, or even brag about you to others.

>* Hanging out is natural and frequent — after class, during weekends, or for no reason at all. You actively plan outings (movies, food, trips) even without school/college forcing it. On tours, friends usually stick together: sit together on the bus, share snacks, take silly photos, and create inside jokes, like

>>* After exams, your friend group plans a picnic in the park, not just relying on school trips.

>>* You and your friends organize a trip during semester break, pooling money and staying up late planning.

Now you know the differences. So when you look at this subject through an Islamic lens, you can understand that it is totally possible to be an acquaintance with the opposite sex, but being a friend isn't possible. Let's look at the scripture

>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""No man should stay with a lady in seclusion except in the presence of a Dhu- Muhram."" A man stood up and said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My wife has gone out intending to perform the Hajj and I have been enrolled (in the army) for such-and-such campaign."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Return and perform the Hajj with your wife."" 

[[Sahih al-Bukhari 5233](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5233)], [[Sahih Muslim 1341a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1341a)]

>Behold! A man is not alone with a woman but the third of them is Ash-Shaitan. 

[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2165](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2165)]

When you take this hadith into account, befriending opposite sex becomes literally impossible. This prohibits you from visiting each other's home, hanging out, going on trips and all of that because you two can't be alone. But being an acquaintance is possible because your interactions happen in public.

___

>˹O Prophet!˺ Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their chastity. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do.

>And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments1 except what normally appears.2

[[Quran 24:30-31](https://quran.com/24?startingVerse=30&translations=20%2C131)]

>Jarir b. 'Abdullah reported:

>I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the sudden glance (that is cast) on the face (of a non-Mahram). He commanded me that I should turn away my eyes.

[[Sahih Muslim 2159a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2159a)]

>Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said: to Ali: Do not give a second look, Ali, (because) while you are not to blame for the first, you have no right to the second.

[[Sunan Abi Dawud 2149](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2149)]

>Narrated `Abdullah bin Abbas:

>Al-Fadl (his brother) was riding behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and a woman from the tribe of Khath'am came and Al-Fadl started looking at her and she started looking at him. The Prophet (ﷺ) turned Al-Fadl's face to the other side. The woman said, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The obligation of Hajj enjoined by Allah on His devotees has become due on my father and he is old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform Hajj on his behalf?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""Yes, you may."" That happened during the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ).

[[Sahih al-Bukhari 1513](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1513)]

So you are not allowed to gaze at the opposite sex. When you are friends with someone you have to look at each other a lot because you are going to talk to each other a lot, the topics of those conversations aren’t always on necessary matters, so all the looks are also unnecessary gazing. Therefore befriending opposite sex becomes prohibited. But being an acquaintance is fine because your conversation with the acquaintance is generally brief and necessary, therefore looking at them is also brief and out of necessity. Your interaction with an acquaintance is to the point. I'm going to quote from [seekersguidance](https://seekersguidance.org/answers/modesty/guidelines-for-interacting-with-the-opposite-sex/)

*❝What guarding the gaze means is that you should refrain from staring at a woman’s face (if she’s not a member of your unmarriageable kin or your wife). It does not mean keeping one’s eyes glued to the ground. In Western societies, guarding one’s gaze can sometimes be interpreted as a lack of assertiveness or respect for the other person.*

*However, with Muslims, guarding one’s gaze indicates respect for the other person’s space and modesty of intention. Our scholars have said that looking at a woman’s face is permitted in certain occasions. For example, if you are seeking a woman in marriage, it is permitted to look at her face. If you work in any type of job that requires you to look at people and interact with them, looking is permitted as long as you don’t look with desire. If you are a teacher, looking at your female students is permitted as long as you don’t look more than necessary or with desire. In short, be modest and respectful.❞*

___

>Ma’qil ibn Yasar reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “For an iron nail to pierce the head of one of you would be better for him than to touch a woman who is not lawful for him.”

[[al-Mu’jam al-Kabīr lil-Ṭabarānī 20/211](https://www.abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2013/12/03/zina-do-not-touch-women/)]

You are not allowed to touch a non mahram, but friendship involves a lot of unnecessary touching, patting. So it's not possible to be friends with the opposite sex. But when you deal with an acquaintance, these unnecessary touchings are avoided since those interactions are necessary and to the point.

___


If you disagree with me and want to have a respectful discussion then I'm all for it.

[P.S: And I wanted to add that the scholars also convey similar message (before writing this post I went through some of their contents on this subject). Interaction with opposite sex is not prohibited and they do not prohibit interactions either. But when you follow the guidelines friendship becomes impossible but acquaintanceship is very much possible. For example [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv41m-GXBxs) Dr Zakir Naik was asked about friendship with opposite sex and he goes over this ""acquaintance vs friend"" thing. [Mufti Menk](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PsqdOS8bKy4), [Nouman Ali Khan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPJIFvcvaA) [Omar Suleiman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekej1gswkpY) also discussed about the permissible acquainted interaction vs friendship]",0,1757273770.0,progressive_islam,2,0.25,False

What is the most impactful action I can take right now to move toward my goals, prioritize the essential, and cultivate my happiness?

Basically, for example, if I wake up at 7:00 AM, I need to start this 3-hour ""Deep Work"" session between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM.  
It’s critical that during these three hours, there’s no music, no sounds and no picking up my phone. I think the key to this approach is the mindset that, after those three hours, I can do whatever I want for the rest of the day, whether that’s relaxing, watching series, or taking it easy. Usually, the momentum I gain during those three hours of deep, focused work carries over, making the rest of the day productive in projects that genuinely align with answering the question I mentioned earlier. During this session, it’s important to stay hydrated, and I find that having a coffee also helps me stay alert.

In summary, the inertia, momentum, and sense of satisfaction from accomplishing something meaningful during those three hours of dedication have become a key driver for achieving great things.",15,1757273700.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

Life in your 30s feels like standing at the crossroads of “still figuring it out” and “already expected to have it together.” It’s when your body starts asking for sleep instead of shots, when friendships shift from endless nights out to coffee catch-ups, and when you realize peace is actually more attractive than drama.


There’s pressure—career, relationships, family, stability—but there’s also clarity. You’ve been through enough to know what you don’t want, and you’re starting to fight harder for what you do. The 30s are messy, grounding, and liberating all at once: a decade of building, unlearning, and slowly learning how to love the person you’ve become.

✨ It’s not about having it all figured out, but about finally living life on your own terms.

Loud café noises in the background, before the sound can die down to focus on the speaker.

**Speaker**

**(sighs)**

20 past the hour and… nothing. Of course they haven’t turned up. Why would they? They probably think I’m trying to entrap them or something.

**(pause)**

This was always a long shot but… where are they? Are they too scared to face me??  

**(footsteps)**

Huh? Oh, yeah, cappuccino here. Thankyou.

**(sound of mug being put down)**

Yeah, extra large. I, urm, didn’t sleep much last night, so it’s needed, hehe! Urmm… that’s everything, thankyou! What are you staring… oh? No. I’m fine!

**(footsteps to show barista is walking away. Speaker sighs)**

Shit. That barista must have seen the rope marks on my wrists. Arggh, are they *ever* going to fade?? Goddam it! I hate these sleeves, they roll up all the time!!

**(sips coffee too quick, then coughs)**

Ouch! Ahhh, screw this! What the hell am I doing here?? Why do I even want see them again after what they did? Sipping coffee with my former kidnapper? It’s messed up!! Who cares if they can’t be bothered to turn up? They can burn in hell! Oh!

**(sound of smashing mug, Speaker can sound a little shocked)**

It’s… you. You came.

**(moment as the two of them stare at each other, then speaker can almost whisper)**

I… I can’t believe…

**(pause, then footsteps)**

Ahhh damn it, that barista is coming over. Just be cool. Sorry, yes, clean up here. No no, everything is fine. Sorry for smashing the mug. Butter fingers, hehe! Urm yeah, I’d like another coffee, thanks. Same as before.  

**(pause, footsteps to show barista leaving)**

You don’t need to look so jumpy, you know. That barista isn’t an undercover cop or something. Like I said in my message. It’s just me here. I promise.

**(pause)**

Don’t you trust me?

**(pause)**

Maybe we should sit? You look kinda pale. Have you eaten in the last… month? I mean… if you’re hungry, the walnut cake is kinda good here, or the cheese toastie… woah! No no no, no need to jump like that! I know you were just taking your coat off, but… urm, do you mind, if it’s not too much trouble, not making any sudden movements, please? And… just stay on that side of the table, yeah? Let’s just sit down together. Like that. Nice and slow. There we go.

**(pause)**

So… urm… how you been?

**(few seconds of silence)**

Not gonna say anything? Just gonna stare at me? Come on. Surely there’s something you want to say. Now’s your chance. You got anything to get off your chest? After all, it’s been weeks since I got away...

**(pause, speaker can sound a little more annoyed)**

Still nothing? Well, whether you choose to talk to me or not, you should know. As you can see, I picked a *very* busy establishment for us to meet in. There’s plenty of people. If… if you try anything. If you attempt to touch me or even move wrong, I’ll scream so loudly it’ll… burst your ear drums! Got it?

**(pause)**

Oh, so you can talk! Wonderful! What do I think you’re going to do? Is that some sort of joke??

**(footsteps as Barista returns)**

Oh, yeah, extra large cappuccino, thankyou. You know what, they’ll have the same. On me.

**(footsteps)**

Save it. You look half dead. And I didn’t invite you here to watch you keel over on me.

**(sighs)**

So, guessing you’re not gonna tell me where you’ve been? Guessing it wasn’t someone hot and sandy, or even… nice. I mean, just *look* at you. Bet you’ve not seen the inside of a shower for a while. I mean, did you not think that maybe I could have helped you if you’d thought to reach out? Did it not cross your mind?? Did you even think about me at all since… what happened?

**(pause)**

Oh, quiet again. Guess you didn’t. Kinda ironic, don’t you think? I mean, you do what you did to me, and then it’s complete radio silence. Like you vanished into thin air. Never mind me, maybe being just a tiny bit worried about you here. Thinking that you’d gone and *died* somewhere. Oh no.

**(pause)**

Oh, worried I was angry, were you? Of course, how could I be angry? What possible reason could I have? Come on. Now we’re on the subject. Why might I be just a tiny little bit pissed off with you? Cat got your tongue? It’s funny, you know, how you seem to have lost your voice. I seem to remember you doing *all* the talking last time. You know, when you’d stuck a fricking strip of tape on my mouth so I couldn’t answer back.

**(sound of chair scraping)**

 No. You sit your ass down. You’ve come here today, and you do not get to walk away from this! It’s time you took some responsibility. For the first time in your *fucking* life…

**(deep breath)**

Shit. I promised myself I wouldn’t lose it. You know, it took everything I had to be here. But I had to, or I’m gonna go crazy. Because a part of me is still there, in that basement, and I need to get myself free. I need to face you. I want to look you straight in the eye and ask you to explain yourself.

**(pause)**

Explain what? Oh, I dunno. How about how you tied me up and left me alone in the dark for hours, like some fricking animal? How about how you told me that you were gonna keep me there, forever, as some sort of…love slave? That I was yours and nobody else’s. That I’d never see my family again! How about the fact that you *kidnapped* me?

**(pause)**

It wasn’t like that? Oh, then how was it? Come on. How do *you* process what you did to me? Because you see, all I can do is think about it. Day after day. Night after night. Sat in my room, staring at the walls, wondering if I’m going insane. Terrified of trying to sleep, because every time I close my eyes I’m back there. Your prisoner all over again. I’m reliving it all the time. I can’t eat, I’ve barley spoken to anyone, I’m on the verge of losing my job… I’m a mess! And you, you sadistic arsehole. You did this to me!  

**(pause)**

You’re sorry? That’s all you’ve got for me?? You think that makes everything okay? Do you have *any* idea how scared I was? I couldn’t move! I was completely helpless and you just… you got off on it. You loved the powerplay. It was like you became someone else. The planning you went to so we’d be alone. Tying me up so goddam tight I’d have no way of freeing myself. I mean, I’ve read stories of people losing their limbs from stuff like that. Did you not think???

**(pause)**

Ohhhh. Yeah. Of course. You let me go. Well… I’ve had time to think about that too. Going over and over it in my mind. That knife that I found, so I could cut myself free and run out the house through all the unlocked doors. Maybe that *was* you coming to your senses. After all, I’d begged and begged you to let me go. When I saw the knife on the floor, I couldn’t believe it. For about five seconds I did think I’d gotten through to you. But then, maybe that wasn’t it. Maybe you’re just such a screw up that you dropped that knife, realised I’d found it, and knew that if you came back down there and I was free, I’d likely shove the damn thing in your throat! So, you ran. Because I screwed up your plans. And you couldn’t face me after that.

**(deep breath, forced calm)**

That’s not it, eh? How can I believe that. How can I believe anything you say??

**(footsteps, then clink of coffee cups)**

What? Oh, thanks. Yeah, I think they *definitely* need extra sugar.

**(footsteps, then a sigh)**

For the record, I *do* believe you let me go. It’s the only decent thing you did that day. Why do you think I didn’t call the police? Why do you think I didn’t tell anyone?

**(pause)**

I just couldn’t see you be put away for years like a… dog. Oh, don’t think I didn’t consider it though! Every day since I’ve wondered if that was the day I finally shop you. But I had to speak to you first. I had to understand what you were thinking. And when I saw you flash up on Discord yesterday, online for the first time since God knows when, I figured this was my chance. So I messaged. And here we are.

**(pause)**

I know how much worse it could have been. I’ve *imagined* how much worse. You could have literally done anything to me and I wouldn’t have been able to stop you. But you didn’t. In the end, you did the right thing. It doesn’t make it okay, but you did the right thing. Whatever evil thoughts were driving you, you stopped them. And for that, I *am* grateful.

**(pause)**

You just wanted to protect me from the world? And did you ever think that maybe it was *you* I needed protecting from? That’s why you stayed away, huh? And why have you come here today then? What’s changed? Why re-surface? Oh…

**(pause)**

Really? You’re turning yourself in? I… oh! No no, I just… I didn’t expect that.

**(pause)**

You… you do know what this means, right? You kidnapped me. You’ll go to prison for sure! Maybe for years. Can you cope with that??

**(pause)**

Don’t I want that?? I… I don’t know, damn it! I want you to take responsibility. I want you to understand that what you did was wrong. Up until now, I wasn’t sure that you did, but seeing you here, looking like you do, I…

**(pause)**

Yes, I agree you need help. But I’m not sure you’ll get what you need in prison. Maybe you are… dangerous. Or at least, you have dangerous thoughts. But prison doesn’t always fix that. Sometimes, it can make you even worse.  

**(pause)**

Well, you say it’s your decision, but I’m not too sure about that. The police will want my side of it. And what if I just don’t tell them what happened. What if I deny it all?

**(pause)**

Why?

**(sighs)**

You know, when you told me you loved me, round about the time I was begging you to let me out of those ropes, I felt that. In my soul. It went through me like a bolt of lightning.  And I guess that’s the problem. Because despite everything you did to me, I care about you. I always have done. I’ve tried to ignore it, tried to focus on hating you… but I can’t do it. You said you loved me enough to want to protect from the world. That I was everything to you. Well, it might be crazy, but… I feel like that too. Even if it means protecting you from yourself.

**(pause)**

So no. I don’t want you to go to prison. I want you to get some help. I want you to promise me that you will work to sort yourself out. I… I want you to come back.  

**(pause)**

I’ve never been more serious about anything.

**(sighs)**

I’m saying… I’m willing to try and move past this. It won’t be easy, but with a shit tonne of therapy… then maybe. Maybe there can be a happy ending here after all.

**(pause)**

I… okay. Yes. You can hold my hand.

**(pause)**

Yeah, they’re rope marks. Some scars take longer to fully heal. But they will.

**(pause)**

Don’t thank me. Show me you can be better. Because this can never happen again. Not to me, or to anyone.

**(pause)**

Maybe you are crazy. But hey. Maybe it takes one yandere to know another. So. How’s about you finish your coffee. And let’s go home.

1nb288f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nb288f,BATTLE FOR TREE’S WISDOM 16 “Caught Potato”,"Welcome to another episode of BFTW! I know it’s been a while so here’s a quick disclaimer, episodes will now be weekly and voting will still be 3 days. School’s taken a priority, I’m sorry.

But who cares about that? You care about the show! And we are long overdue!

SPADOW: Snow Pea tries to host a team meeting, including Sunflower and Peashooter. However, Peashooter and Sunflower are catching up away from the others. Wall Nut, now in charge of Toag, tries to introduce himself, but Toag was not amused.

Fun Guys:Puff Shroom and Sun Shroom have some…alone time. Ice Shroom seems to be frowning at how no one seems to really be missing him, but then again, he’s always frowning.

The Logs:With the trio now exposed, Tamgle Kelp seems…genuinely hurt by the betrayal. Squash is hanging out with the fellow team leaders, including Torchwood.

Shining Stars: Split Pea’s new neighbour seems to be a very jovial little fella, much to Split’s annoyance. Cactus is not really interested in talking to anyone. Pumpkin finally confesses how much he misses Wall Nut, especially after he was put in danger. Magnet reassures him that he’ll find another opportunity to reunite.

Team Pult: Winter Melon is incredibly proud of her siblings for surviving, while they’re just happy she’s back. Melon Pult feels a bit left out, but is promised he’ll win the rejoin. It seems Melon actually wants to rejoin, a detail Peashooter notices.

The Best: Cob Cannon brags to Golden Magnet and Gloom Shroom how hid team regained their honour as the best team. They don’t care. Spikerock tries talking to Imitater who coldly rejects her.

Time for the rejoin! Only one person will rejoin so let’s blitz through the 0 vote getters!

DEEP BREATH

Lilly Pad, Ice Shroom, Marigold, Gloom Shroom, Gold Magnet, Plant Pot and Cactus all fail to rejoin!

Now one of the remaindersgot 2 votes while the rest got 1, so, alphabetically…

DEEP BREATH

Coffee Bean, Split Pea, Sunflower, Melon Pult and Torchwood only recieved one vote, meaning it’s down to Puff Shroom and Peashooter to rejoin, the most recently eliminated contestants!

And the person rejoining is…




Peashooter!




Peashooter says how grateful he is to be chosen, but he can’t accept it, he knows that at some point during the competition, he’ll have to leave Zen Garden. He doesn’t want to lose Sunflower again, he refuses the rejoin. But since he did get the most votes, Peashooter will decide who will rejoin, out of the contestants who actually got votes.

In the end, Peashooter chooses for…




Melon Pult to rejoin!

Melon Pult hugs Peashooter and is forever grateful for letting him rejoin.

But the rejoin was only one of the twists, because we will also be disbanding the teams! Making new teams! Everyone will gather into 5 teams of 7 and before Imitater can point put the mathematical inconsistency, the people are swarming!

Team 1: Snow Pea and Repeater decide to stick together due to their excellent synergy. A defecting Sun Shroom also joins in, followed by Fume Shroom who followed after her, also bringing along Gravebuster. Finally Snow Pea takes in a depressed Tangle Kelp and Jalepeno and form the first team.

As for the team name Snow Pea suggests they should be called what Snow Pea wants them all to find…

INNER PEAS
Snow Pea, Repeater, Sun Shroom, Fume Shroom, Gravebuster, Tangle Kelp and Jalepeno

Team 2: Pumpkin comes up with the perfect idea on how to solve his problems, he snatches up Wall Nut and Tall Nut and brings them to Sea Shroom, Starfruit and Magnet Shroom! Squash also tags alimg as him and Tall Nut were the last REAL team leaders of The Logs.

For their name, Starfruit doesn’t want to change the name too much, but foes want to show they mean business, their team name is…

SHOOTING STARS
Wall Nut, Squash, Tall Nut, Sea Shroom, Starfruit, Pumpkin and Magnet Shroom

Team 3: The Pult Brothers immediately decide to stick together, remembering Gatling’s act of sacrifice, they bring him on as well, only for Cob Cannon to barge in also. He apologises for his harsh actions and promotes his inclusion as a change to change his ways. Garlic also stayed as well…great…

When asked about the team name, Melon Pult says they should just be called

TEAM PULT 2
Cabbage Pult, Kernel Pult, Garlic, Melon Pult, Gatling Pea, Winter Melon and Cob Cannon

Team 4: Chomper wants to be on a team of fellow tough guys and joins up with Hypno Shroom, Scaredy Shroom and Doom Shroom. With a Plantern and practically forced Blover joining also, followed by Spikerock and Imitater.

When asked for their name, the team settles on what brought them together…

DANGER
Chomper, Hypno Shroom, Scaredy Shroom, Doom Shroom, Plantern, Blover, Spikerock and Imitater?

Team 5: Conveniently, this left just 7 members left, Cherry Bomb, Potato Mine, Threepeater, Spikeweed, Umbrella Leaf, Twin Sunflower, and Cattail. Threepeater is offended he is apart of the rejects due to his hard work on The Logs, as is Spikeweed for his hard work.

Despite the initial disappointment of being rejects, Potato Mine inspires his team, empowering them to not be seen as rejects but as…

THE LEFTOVERS
Cherry Bomb. Potato Mine, Threepeater, Spikeweed, Umbrella Leaf, Twin Sunflower and Cattail.

And with that our new teams are set and we begin a new era of BFTW!

However, the moment is ruined when Imitater calls out the miscalculation, turns out they didn’t forget the result, but to give someone the bad mews.

Back in episode 5, Imitater was always just meant to be a replacement for Winter Melon, but now with her back, Imitater has no reason to stay…

Imitater is officially disqualified from BFTW

Imitater refuses to accept this and demands to go down with a fight. A fight he will get!

For the first challenge of phase 2, the challenge will be to get rid of Imitater, all they have to do is remove him from the Zen Garden, it doesn’t matter how long, the last team to have removed Imitater will be up for voting, GO!

1st: Team Pult 2

Garlic wastes no time and chases Imitater, repelling him out of the Zen Garden before he realises his mistake and bolts back in. Did he stay out there? No, but he was out there, which counts by the rules of the challenge! Earning them the first ever first place of the era! Cob Cannon smirking at Garlic’s newfound potential.

2nd: Inner Peas
A growing Sun Shroom sumos Imitater back out of the Zen Garden, he bolts back again, but Inner Peas does earn them safety!

3rd: Shooting Stars
Squash tries to push Imitater out, but he transforms into metal, which Magnet uses to send Imitater out of Zen Garden for a moment, gaining them freedom from the bottom 2!

4th: DANGER
They probably would have dome better, if Imitater didn’t immediately use Doom Shroom as a smoke bomb and killed off Hypno Shroom and Plantern at once. Spikerock finally confronts Imitater and promise to talk things out. Spikerock explains that she only hang put with the opposing side because he saw how close Imitater and Cob were getting. Imitater explains that despite how angry he was at Spikerock, he owes her so muxh for everything he had become, it’s the reason he doesn’t want to leave. Spikerock thanks Imitater for agreeing to joining the team, even if it was all for nothing. Imitater tells Spikerock to keep doing what she does best, help others. The tenderness is cut off and Chomper throws Imitater out of the Zen Garden. He re-enters, but, he says he is fine with properly leaving, but warns they will regret this before leaving.

LAST: The Leftovers
The team never got the opportunity to even approach Imitater before the madness began. Leading to them becoming the first blood of the new era!

And for the first time in a while…VEIWERS! Vote for a member of The Leftovers you qant to be SAFE! The person with the LEAST votes will be eliminated! See you all next week in episode 17! And here’s to a new ERA!",1,1757272950.0,ObjectShows,2,1.0,False

I was using an older Virtuoso (not a Virtuoso+) that I tweaked so that it would produce passable espresso, but the retention was awful, and the particle inconsistency often resulted in uneven extractions.

I think that any grinder that was specifically designed for espresso would have knocked my socks off in comparison to the Virtuoso, but I also think that going with a flat burr grinder increases the wow factor for me. It’s like I’m drinking totally different coffee now. 

It’s super quiet (I can have a conversation with my wife while grinding coffee), super fast, and has almost zero retention. 

The catch cup is a bit wonky. It doesn’t seem to be magnetically centered, but that may be intentional. So far, this hasn’t produced any big messes or anything, but I did notice that it doesn’t cooperate with my decaf very well — it likes to hold onto 0.1–0.2 at the bottom of the cup. This hasn’t been an issue, but it is a PITA to get that stuff out, even with the included brush and blower. 

I’m also excited to see how it performs with a v60. I haven’t brewed filter coffee in months because the retention on my Virtuoso meant I’d always have espresso-fine particles in my v60 bed. ",11,1757272796.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1nb24zq,http://www.menwhofrench.com,"🥂 Baguettes, Bubbles & a Week of French Immersion in the South of France 🇫🇷","How often have you caught yourself…

* Wishing your Zoom background was a café terrace in Nice?
* Polishing your French accent when no one’s listening?
* Watching *Emily in Paris* and whispering, “I could actually live this”?

It’s time to make that daydream less *someday* and more *this year.*

# The Experience

For one week in May 2026, a small group of men will trade daily routines for French immersion on the Côte d’Azur. Think seaside markets, elegant cafés, curated excursions, and conversations entirely en français.

This isn’t a classroom, and it’s not a tourist package. It’s an immersion designed for people who love French language, culture, and lifestyle—and want to live it fully for eight days.

# What Awaits You

* 🥐 Mornings with croissants and coffee that rival any Instagram filter
* 🍷 Evenings of wine, laughter, and conversations you’ll actually remember
* 🎨 Private access to cultural gems beyond the typical guidebook
* 🗣️ Daily French practice—without the Duolingo owl hovering over you
* ✨ A community of like-minded men who see travel as something more than sightseeing

# Who This Is For

Whether you’re just beginning your French journey or refining your fluency, you belong here. This is about progress, not perfection—connection, not correction.

# Why This Matters

We all say we’ll “get to France one day.” But planning an experience that blends culture, language, and genuine connection is rarely straightforward. That’s where we come in: every detail is arranged so you can focus on living the French life you’ve imagined—if only for a week.

**The Invitation**  
If your idea of travel is more *café society* than *tour-bus itinerary*, this is for you. Come practice your French, expand your perspective, and return home with stories that last longer than your tan.

Ok so I went with totally different chairs than the white i was looking at and went with rich green velvet.  I got rid of the wool carpet and moved it to under the coffee table like how it looks there too.  So my original post i was asking about the carpet under table and I bought a bigger one where all the chair feet were on it but it was way too big and overwhelming for the space. I'm an idiot and didt take a picture before returning it. It was the right size for the table for too big for the room. So ultimately what I have is a table that's too big for my space i get that. I can either leave it or buy a smaller one or buy a round one which I think would look fantastic under the light with the rounded back chairs but the idea of trying to sell my table to buy another seems like such a hassle.  Ok the other issue is that the table is the same colouring as the hardwood floors so it all just kind of blends and the carpet did a great job of breaking them apart. So the other thing I thought was to sand it down, the table is real wood so I could stain it a lighter or darker colour but again that just seems excessive.  Oh and from the original post I rotated 
The table 90 degrees to be lengthwise.  And i also put on velvet leg protectors so the chairs slide in and out easily and won't mark up my floors.

Pllease give any thoughts opinions you have on anything I wrote, I just need some feedback on of this setup if looks good or if I need to work on changing anything.  Thanks",1,1757272723.0,interiordecorating,2,1.0,False
1nb23ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nb23ko/i_think_my_dad_is_a_narcissist_what_do_i_do/,"I think my dad is a narcissist, what do I do?","I am 23 F, and my dad is 59.

Throughout my life, I have experienced behaviors from my dad that I am now suspecting are from narcissistic tendencies. I used to always be on my toes and feel like I am walking on eggshells when dealing with my dad, but now I really do not gaf anymore, which is why I am making this post.

For context, I am of South Asian/Desi background, and it is very common for Desi girls to have to deal with narcissistic fathers. For generations, our fathers have been treating us like shit and it is very normalized in our community because no one ever holds fathers accountable for their behavior.

Desi girls WANT to love their fathers, but our fathers make it really hard for us.

My dad is constantly angry and tends to shit on everyone else's happiness, and then he complains that our household always has bad energy, not realizing that it is him who causes that most of the time.

Ever since I was a child, he has been inflicting emotional abuse onto me.

**Some examples:**

\- When he runs his mouth about something and forces me to listen, and I just sit there quietly and listen to him, he accuses me of ""making faces"" and gets offended for no reason. He makes shit up to blame me for SOMETHING.

\- Any time he is mean to me or anyone else in my family, he blames it on his childhood trauma. He uses his childhood trauma as an excuse to be an asshole.

\- Speaking of childhood trauma, he says that because he experienced trauma as a child, he expects the love he was missing from his own children and he also expects us to heal him. He makes it everyone's fucking problem.

\- He thinks parents are always right no matter what. To quote him, he says ""Parents are always right, even if they are wrong, they are still right."" Guys we have a philosopher over here. His justification is that his own father was abusive, but he put up with it and was patient, as if putting up with parental abuse is some kind of virtue.

\- He constantly makes up hypothetical scenarios and gets mad at them. He uses them to get mad at us. For example, he says (to me), ""When you get married, I know that when I visit you, you will chase me away and abandon me, and I am already mentally prepared for that"". Then he constantly laments the fact that one day I will have my own family and kids, and voices how sad that makes him. He also openly says that he will not like my future children because ""I will have to share my love with them and he doesn't want me to share my love and he wants it all to himself"". Ngl my mom is kinda complicit in this particular behavior because she brushes it off, saying that he is just joking and he says that because he loves me a lot.

\- He tells everyone about my achievements, but behind closed doors he shits on me. I believe that he brags about my achievements to everyone to fuel his own ego and show everyone what a ""good"" parent he is. I constantly beg him not to tell anyone about what I'm up to and my achievements because I want to keep those things private but he does not listen to me. When no one is around, he takes every opportunity to ""humble"" me and says that I am not as smart and that I am not a good student. However, there were instances where he tried ""humbling"" me in front of other people. For example, when a guest asked me about how the human heart works out of curiosity, my dad interrupted us saying ""She doesn't know that, why are you asking her that?"" Like wowww I bet he felt so good about himself at that moment. Even the guest was weirded out by that.

\- When he ""humbles"" me, he claims that he does it to motivate/inspire me to do even better because he wants the best for me. When I let him know anytime that I have a busy day ahead of me, he says ""I don't feel bad for you."" Okay well I wasn't begging for your sympathy, I was just letting you know because I don't want your stupid plans to interfere with mine. He also said that he says he does not feel bad for me to motivate me.

\- During my graduation, he had a scowl on his face the whole time and was shitting on everyone who graduated with me that day. Like he could not even smile slightly for me on a special day. He looked like he would rather be anywhere else. Then on the way home after the graduation ceremony, he was lecturing me and my siblings about morality or whatever the fuck and just made the whole car ride so uncomfortable and the atmosphere so negative.

\- I am speaking for my younger brother here. When he won a scholarship and was invited to the scholarship banquet, he took both our parents. The whole time there, my dad kept saying how the scholarship he got was ""puny"", ""it doesn't mean anything"", and my dad was just being an absolute displeasure to be around, as he always does.

\- We went on a road trip a couple of months ago and the whole time he was complaining about all the trauma in his life. When we visited NYC, I was really excited to go on the ferry and he saw that as an opportunity to shit all over it by being mean to me the whole ferry ride and having a scowl on his face. Meanwhile, I wanted everyone in my family to have fun and enjoy the ferry ride, but he pretty much ruined it for everyone by fostering this negative vibe.

\- He cannot stand the fact that I am an adult now. These days, whenever he is mean to me, I speak up against it, and then he says I am talking back and being disrespectful. Then he says that I am not ""docile"" anymore and that he misses when I was ""loyal"" to him. He says that I ""changed' to make me feel bad. He also says ""Ohh so you're showing that you're an adult now."" Like actually piss off. Well I don't. Whenever we have arguments, he complains about me to my mom and bitches about it the whole night and does not let her sleep. He is extremely inconsiderate.

\- Whenever I had classes, and he would waste my time by talking about something and making me listen or make me do a chore, and at the same time I needed to study for an exam, he would say that I am selfish and I am fetching for myself. He would call me self-centered and say that my degree does not mean anything to him and it's all for me.

\- When he felt sick sometimes he would constantly make me feel bad by saying ""are you not going to ask me how I'm feeling, you're so self-centered."" I was a literal child at the time.

\- He would always give me the silent treatment ever since I was a child. Now as an adult, I do the same shit back. Two can play that game.

\- As a child he would feel the need to humble me constantly. When I was 12, he was mad at me because at the time, a family friend of ours graduated high school and was going to a prestigious university. He got mad at me and was like ""what the hell are you doing with your life?"" I was 12...  
Another time when we were traveling by train, there was this young woman sitting across the aisle and my family was making conversation with them. My dad forced me to have a conversation with her for whatever fucking reason. I was around 9 at the time and I was a pretty shy kid. What was the point of forcing me to have a conversation with a literal stranger and making me uncomfortable? Then when we got to our place and when the lady left the train, my dad went out of his way to get mad at me and say ""She went to university, compared to her, you are nothing"". Then the rest of the day he was berating me and the whole time I was wondering wtf did I do wrong. Another time, when I was 9, we had a neighbor whose daughter was studying engineering at Cambridge, and my dad called me to talk to her, my dad told me, in front of her, ""You are not a good student, okay?"".

\- When I was around 9 or 10, my dad got mad at me for not knowing who Harry S. Truman was, and was bragging about how he knew who Harry S. Truman was at my age. So I felt really bad and read his whole Wikipedia page to get my dad's validation. My dad also got mad at me for not knowing that Anne Hathaway's dad was a lawyer and was bragging about how he knew that because he reads about stuff like that.

\- I like to do community service, so when I was volunteering at a children's hospital and baked cookies for the patients and their families that day, my dad said ""pffttt why would you ever do that"", as if it was something below me. I think he said that because he could not imagine himself doing something like that and his ego is too big.

\- I hate his holier-than-thou attitude. He constantly judges everyone meanwhile he is a mega asshole and is mean and rude to everyone.

\- When he is in a good mood, he calls me his mom and says that he is my baby. He paints me as a motherly, nurturing figure for him. In my culture, it is very normal for parents to call their daughters ""ma"" (mom) as a way of affection, which is why I thought this was normal this whole time. idk man.

\- He has me on life360. He claims that it is for my safety but I doubt that. I genuinely think he does not trust me.

\- I don't bother going out anymore because it's like I have to mentally prepare myself to even ask him if I can go out. When I do go out he calls me like 20 times. He does the same thing when my mom goes out. When I'm on the phone with friends (which is rare) he bothers me so much, so I don't even bother calling as often. It's as if I fear being on the phone when he's at home.

\- He constantly brags about having no friends and says that having friends is useless. He says ""In life, you should not have friends."" I mean yeah I myself have a couple friends who are very close to me, but damn, not even one friend? He made it seem like not having friends is sooooo cool because he brags about it so much.

\- He is extremely pretentious when it comes to hobbies and interests. He cannot be authentic with himself and likes things just to say that he likes said things. He does this with music, literature, movies, etc., and he is always in competition with me to see who has more obscure interests. Once I showed him a rock song i liked and he said it's really ""light"" and ""mundane"" and he prefers ""heavy-duty"" stuff, whatever the fuck that means. Why does it sound like he's talking about washing machines? Any time he comes into my room, he says that all the things in my room are fake and to show off how cool I am. He also said all the books in my bookshelf are for showing off and that i do not actually read them. First of all, no one comes to my house and second of all i don't have social media, so who tf am i showing off my room and its contents to???

\- He dictates everyone in the house to do household chores WHILE laying down on the couch watching TV all day. When we call him out on it, he says that he ""paid his dues already"".

\- When I'm outside he calls me and cries over the phone and says that he is worried about my safety and gets scared when i'm not at home, even though I'm literally just at a coffee shop reading a book.

\- He uses me as an emotional lap dog.

\- He shits on my clothing choices. Once he had a problem with me wearing a sun hat/bucket hat that had a red gingham/plaid pattern on it, and he said that it looked ugly and called me a ""freak show"". He said that he had to say that because he just wants the best for me.

\- He acts all tough when guests come over. When we have guests over, he screams and yells at me and my siblings to do the dishes, clean the dining tables, etc. He puts on this whole performance especially in front of other people, and I think it's because he's insecure and wants to show how tough he is.

\- Whenever we disagree with him on anything or refuse to do something for him, he says ""Oh so you're going to defy me now?""

Honestly, now I am just convinced he just hates me. Like he only ever loved me when I was a baby but as I grew up he started hating me and treats me like shit to this day.

Credit goes to u/sternenpups for showcasing this build and for giving me tips on how to utilize it. 

Now I'm not going to lie, my first impression of this build was ""Hit or miss"" as in, you either do really well with it, or you do horribly. There is no ""in between"". The first couple 10 games, I suffered a lot, but between them was 2 games where I felt like a monster. The pattern is, in the successful games, I was consistent and in the other ones, I was taking a beating and wasting lot of time. Maybe after some adjustment time, it can get better for me. 

If you are doing this correctly, then you should see this once you press ""TAB"":

[Highest level \/ Highest CS](https://preview.redd.it/q1g17usfisnf1.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=db91a48c4754d8ba1346361135d3e056a3987b61)

As you can see, I have the highest level in the whole game, and have the highest CS number, as well as being 4 levels ahead of the enemy jungler. Statikk Shiv and Stridebeaker offers the best clear in the game, you can literally oneshot two waves in row, then back to clear your jungle.   
  
All this CS increases your level, giving you an advantage against everyone else and that advantage is the key. Because you are not running Blade of the ruined king, or kraken, or any strong DPS item early; you are reliant on being ahead to see results with this build, as levels offers a lot of base stats.   
  
I'm still figuring out this build out as I'm still testing, but this is my first Penta on Warwick in a very long time, and it's kinda cool how Statikk reset with each kill, and Death's dance refresh damage and heal me simultaneously. ",3,1757272574.0,warwickmains,0,0.8,False

- Keeps the familiar slim, vertical footprint and comes in white, stainless steel, sage green and pastel pink with chrome accents and a knurled steam‑wand knob.
- Offers genuine cold extraction: grounds are pre‑infused then cold water is pulsed through the puck, delivering a mellow, smooth beverage.
- Single‑button controls for hot and cold modes; includes a coffee scoop, descaling packet and a basic milk frothing wand.
- Priced under $300; removable water tank, drip tray and portafilter are dishwasher‑safe. The machine lacks a three‑way solenoid, so a small post‑brew drip must be collected.
- Solid construction with a weighted portafilter and durable accessories, avoiding cheap‑plastic parts.

Why it matters: It brings cold‑brew capability to a space‑saving, affordable machine, appealing to apartments and small kitchens.

1nb1x7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nb1x7v/the_curse_game_part_1/,The Curse Game [Part 1],"  
We were having lunch in some restaurant that looked vaguely Italian. I’d forgotten the name by the time we went through the doors. A waiter had escorted us to a table in a dimly lit corner. I guess we didn’t look like locals, since she instantly spoke English to us. My phone was laying on the table when its screen lit up with a text from Chrissie.



\> sooo. hows the lads trip goin?



I didn’t like it when she called it a lads trip. Made it sound like we were some chavs from up north who’d come to drink and treat the place like an adults-only playground. But I guess there was some truth to it–we were lads, and we did do quite a bit of drinking.



\> all good! having some lunch. not sure what the plan is yet for today. maybe just fuck around until we find something cool to do. 



I took a sip of my beer. Somehow it was already my third one of the day. That made me feel a bit self-conscious (am i an alcoholic?), but then again, we were on a trip and the beer was cheap as hell. Chrissie wasn’t online anymore, so I put my phone down and tried to catch up with whatever Case and Trevor were talking about.



“Just saying, we could get there early for cheap. Then just wait until the chicks start rolling in,” Trevor was saying.



“You’re the only one who needs chicks,” Case said, turning to me with that fucking-around smile of his. His facial expressions seemed to only go between a blank slate that seemed like he hated everything, and that weird smile where you weren’t sure if he was masking irreverence or actually enjoying himself more than anyone had ever before in the history of humankind. It was like a ying-yang, except you only saw one half at a time. “Me and Luke are happy in our partnerships. Isn’t that right?”



“Damn right,” I said. My phone buzzed and lit up again, but I didn’t look at it.



“So we’re not going to just be your wingmen at some shifty fucking club all night. I mean, you’re welcome to go by your lonesome, but you’ll be battling against the fine men of Budapest for the attention of said chicks. And I’m not saying you’re not a handsome lad yourself, but…”



“But that’s why I need you guys with me,” Trevor cut in, smiling. “Between you two, I’ll look like a Scandinavian Hunk.”



“More like Scandinavian Hulk,” Case said. We all laughed, even though Trevor looked nothing like Hulk. 



We’d known each other since we were teenagers. Our group used to be bigger, but life happened, and people took different routes. It was kind of amazing that the three of us were still so tight. But it also felt so natural, like it couldn’t be any other way. 



Everyone sipped on their beers for a while, texting whomever. Me and Case our girlfriends back home. Trevor to whoever had matched with him on whatever dating app people used these days. 



“So,” I said, and waited for the guys to put their phones down. “There’s this antiques shop I might wanna check out.”



“Sounds interesting,” Case said.



“Yeah. It’s not too far from here. Just a little walk. The reviews were good.”



“Any particular reason for going there?” Trevor asked.



“I wanna get something for Chrissie. Something that’s not some stupid fridge magnet.”



“Hey, good idea,” Case said. “Might do that too.”



Trevor sighed. “Fine. But then we’ll go do something actually fun.”



After paying for our meals, I escorted our little group to the shop. It was located on a busy street filled with restaurants, but down a flight of stairs. The inside was halfway underground, the windows lining the upper edge of the walls like a basement. Well, it was technically a basement, I guess. 



The cashier greeted us with a mumbling of words in their native language. When we replied with an amiable *Hello!* in chorus, they simply smiled and returned with a well-rehearsed *hello* back to us.



We politely rummaged and giggled our way through the store, picking up weird books and lamps and pointing at the many paintings on the walls. That’s until Case found something and went “Whoa,” uncomfortably loud, like a stoner taking a hit of some really good weed.



“Whatcha got there?” I asked as I made my way to him. 



He was holding a stone statue, two palms tall and a fist’s width. It was dark, but not exactly a uniform black, more like black paint that had chipped off, revealing speckles of red underneath.  Looking at the ragged and haphazardly cut edges, it was definitely hand-carved. Like either the stone was so dense and hard it’d been difficult to crack pieces off it, or the maker had made it in haste. The latter seemed ridiculous, but somehow not totally unbelievable.



The form itself consisted of a creature with long limbs, and a torso like a bag of railroad spikes. Its head was an oval, with a sharp jaw and two eyes that sunk in like puddles inside a dark warehouse. Some sort of horns, long and almost stringy, reached from its head towards the sky, separating into strands that prodded at the air like tiny knives.



Something about it gave me a bad vibe. Made my stomach twist ever so slightly, and a headache began to form at the back of my head.



“Now this is a cursed fucking object if I’ve ever seen one,” Case said, turning the statue carefully in his hands, like he was afraid to break it. 



“Yeah, that’s bad vibes central. Wouldn’t want to bring that back on the plane, or we’d end up on the fucking Lost island.”



“Uhh, spoilers,” Trevor said, appearing next to Case like a ghost.



“That’s not a spoiler. It’s literally the whole premise of the show,” I said.



“Still.”



“Wonder how much it costs,” Case said, his attention firmly on the statue.



“Anything’s too much,” I said, but he was already off to the cashier. Me and Trevor followed, exchanging a look. His was confused, mine concerned. I’m not sure he got why.



“Hello,” Case said again to the cashier. “This statue here, I’d like to buy it. How much is it?”



“Is there a price on it?” they said.



“I can’t see one,” he said, handing it to the cashier, who inspected it from top to bottom. I was trying to see if something changed in their face, if they reacted to the statue as I had. Either they didn’t, or they were simply too focused on the job at hand to give a shit.



The cashier made a sound like *hmm*, and put the statue on the counter. “No price on it. Is fifteen euros good?”



“I’ll take it,” Case said, turning to us with that shit-eating grin. Like he’d just made a huge score.



Case insisted on going by the hotel to drop the stone statue off before we headed out further. I didn’t really feel like backtracking, and thankfully Trevor was insistent that we’d go to a pub just the two of us and Case could catch up. So we parted ways, and Trevor promised to send Case our location once we’d settled somewhere.



The rest of the night was much like all the other nights we’d had in Budapest. Going to different pubs, trying out some more-or-less interesting food, politely gawking at the dissimilarities and similarities between this new country and the country we’d come from and grown up in. Case took his sweet time joining us, but I figured he’d just taken the opportunity to have a wank back at the hotel. God knows I would’ve. He had a plaster on his wrist when he came back though, which gave me the somewhat funny idea in my mind that he’d stroked himself to a chafe.



We were all pretty tired once we got back to our AirBnB, Trevor somehow getting more drunk as he tried to brush his teeth. Or maybe just really tired. Anyway, he finally stumbled his way to the pullout couch in the living room, wearing nothing but boxers and a hoodie, and promptly started snoring facedown. I nudged him to his side so he wouldn’t be breathing through the couch all night.



“You know,” Case said from the kitchen. “I think that thing really is cursed.”



“The statue?” I asked, making my way to the fridge for a bottle of water. Case was leaning against the countertop, a glass of coke in his hand. It may or may not have had some rum in it–he liked to drag his nights out and start his days late.



“I did some sleuthing when I brought it back here. Apparently, it depicts some old creature that used to haunt people.”



“Oh yeah?” I said.



“The story goes,” he said, taking a dramatic sip. “The creature could be beckoned by a witch to stalk a person. Or more like a family, I guess, since that was how it was mostly described. Anyway, the witch would get a piece of hair, strap it to some piece of wood they got from the family’s house, and drench the whole thing in blood. Then they’d lay the bloody stick in the woods, and the creature would come, take its scent, and hunt the family.”



“And then what?”



“Then it would kill whoever’s blood was on the stick, I guess. The stories were basically–” and he put on his best-bad Hungarian accent, “The creature would go to the family home, pillage and draw blood, slay the young and old, and finish before the morning came. When the sun came up, they would be found dead.”



“Well. Cool,” I said. Something in his eyes was bothering me. He wasn’t smiling, but I could feel a grin creeping up behind his retinas, like he was about to pounce on me like a predator.



“It is,” Case said. “And you know what I thought would be fun?”



“What?”



“To test it out.”



“Uhh, what?”



He slowly lifted the glass to his lips, then chugged the rest of his drink in one big gulp. 



“Yeah. Just, you know, seeing if it's real. I got some of your hair and cracked off a piece of wood from the skirting and… bled on it a little bit.”



Anger plumped up behind my throat, burning like alcohol. “Case… what the fuck?” 



“Don’t worry! The skirting was already coming off, and I just took a little piece. No one will know.”



“It’s not that,” I said. The words came out louder than I wanted them to, so I made a mental note to keep it down. Not because of Trevor, even–he wouldn’t wake up if a bomb went off–but because I didn’t want to sound too harsh. “It’s the fact that you just took my hair, put it around some stick and fucking bled on it. Isn’t that a bit fucking weird to you?”



He thought for a moment, or pretended to. “Yeah, I guess. Sorry. I thought it’d be funny.”



“Jesus, Case. Well… it’s not. Where is it?”



He smiled sorry, and a wave of tiredness hit me then. The whole conversation just dropped a ball of lead inside me, and I was too tired and too drunk to continue it. Whatever I would’ve said wouldn’t have come out the way I wanted it to, and I was sure Case would feel like an idiot in the morning anyway. But I felt like ripping into him, but knew that wasn’t the right choice. I didn’t want to ruin the trip.



“Look, it’s fine. Let’s just go to bed, okay?” I said. 



Case put his glass in the sink. “Alright. Just thought you’d find it funny, but sorry anyway.”



“Sure.”



Case was sleeping in the master bedroom on the other side of the house, and I had the smaller one next to the kitchen. Case had really wanted the bigger room, and I didn’t really understand the point of having a lot of space when we’re just staying for a week anyway.



Case went to the bathroom while I brushed my teeth in the kitchen. When he came out, I asked him again where he’d put the stick. *The bloody, stolen-hair stick*, I thought, but didn’t say.



“Oh, it’s in the drawer in your nightstand. Sorry, I’ll come and get it.”



I waved him off. “It’s fine. I’ll throw it out.”



“You sure?” he asked, some disappointment in his eyes. Maybe the weirdness of what he’d done had finally sunk in a bit.



“Yeah. Night.”



“Night,” he said, and went to his room.



The stick was exactly where he’d said it would be. It looked a bit silly, with the ripped-off skirting having one side painted white, and the other a pale, splintering wood. The hairs were few and far between, lazily tied around it, and some dried drops of blood were splattered along it. It looked like someone had had the unfortunate idea of using the stick of wood as a makeshift dildo. 



I grabbed it with a piece of paper and threw it in the bin, making sure the paper covered it so I wouldn’t have to see it the next time I opened it.



When I lay in bed, the whole thing kept me awake. The tiredness I’d felt had gotten lost somewhere along the way. I thought Case saying he was sorry and me throwing the thing away would give me enough resolve to sleep through the night.



I opened up my phone and responded to Chrissie’s message: “Have fun!!” and started Googling. 



It took a while to find the exact creature he’d referred to. I had to first use basic terms to find the general idea of it, then copy-pasted some Hungarian terms that led me to some old, historical sites that had no references or outside links. I had to translate everything, so the English was a bit shoddy. But one of the sites had a picture of a very similar looking statue, and a wall of plain text in a too-small font underneath it. I started reading it.



It seemed that Case was more-or-less right about the creature and the legend. Where the story had come from–or what it meant–the website didn’t say. And all it had to say about the statue itself was that whoever had found it thought it was from the 1550s. 



I heard a click, and then the slow, whiny buzz of my door sliding open. My heart almost jumped out of my chest, and I stood up from the bed. My door was slightly ajar, with the hallway and kitchen beyond veiled by a sliver of darkness.



The pumping of blood in my ears quickly subsided. It was probably just Trevor, getting up to piss but opening the wrong door by accident. The crime fit the perp.



I checked my phone. It was almost four in the morning. I threw it back on the bed, breathed in quickly and slowly out, and walked up to the door. 



All the lights were off, and just the faint flecks of moonlight shone through the cheap curtains behind Trevor. He was sleeping soundly, huffing with each breath like he was about to start snoring. Nothing seemed amiss, but an oppressive feeling crept up my neck. Not exactly the feeling of being watched, but someone seeing me when I couldn’t see them.



When I took a step outside my door, I hit my foot on something hard. I almost yelped, but kept it to a long inhale through my teeth as I cursed in my mind. 



The shape was easy to make out even in the dim light. 



It was the fucking statue. 



Anger bellowed within me, instantly conjuring up ways to get back at Case. Or at least yell at him. He’d thought it’d be so fucking funny to keep the prank, or whatever this was in his mind, going. And now I got a fucking bruised pinkie toe that hurt to walk on. I stormed into his room and opened the door. I’m not sure if he’d been sleeping or not, but the room was dark as he sat up and turned his bedside light on.



“What the fuck dude?” I yelled.



“What?” he said, blinking at the bright light, a confused look on his face.



“Don’t fucking be like that. Just fucking stop.”



“Stop what?” he yelled back.



I had to take a breath not to simply start yelling, forgetting to use actual words. As I exhaled, I could feel my toe swelling up, which mad it harder not to just fucking slap him.



“The statue. Outside my door. You *know* what I’m fucking talking about.”



“Uhh. I actually don’t? The statue’s in my bag last I checked. I wrapped it up in a towel.”



“Well why is it outside my fucking door, then?”



“Is it?”



I grunted and turned to walk out. “Let’s have a look then, shall we?”



He followed right behind me. I turned on the kitchen lights on the way. Trevor didn’t seem to notice the change in light. Or the yelling.



“Look,” I said.



“I didn’t put that there.” 



His face was red, and his eyes glassy. “I didn’t put that there,” he repeated.



“Well who the fuck did?”



“Uhm. Trevor? You? I don’t fucking know. But dude, I swear on my mother this wasn’t me. I got the message, okay. I’m not fucking with you. This isn’t me.”



I looked him in the eyes, and he stared back, unblinking. If he was lying, he was doing a really good job.



“Okay. Okay, fine. So what happened, then?”



He looked around. “You didn’t hear anything else? Someone coming in?”



“Like someone breaking in, sneaking into your room, quietly taking the statue from your bag, then sneaking their way back and placing it behind my door?”



“You know what I mean.”



“Well,” I said. “The door opened.”



“What do you mean it opened?” There was concern in his eyes now. He looked down the hall at the front door.



“I mean it opened. Just a bit, you know. Like someone was there. I thought it was you.”



Case took off to the front door. He turned the lights on, checking the door, the locks, and I guess for any muddy footprints on the ground, judging by the way his head was twisting and turning.



“Are you *sure* you didn’t hear anything else?” he said. “Because Occam’s razor isn’t giving me the best options right now.”



“I’m sure. And what do you mean?”



“Well, either Trevor did it, which we both know he didn’t. Or the weirdest stalker ever with extraordinary capabilities came in and did the best prank in the history of pranks. Or…”



“Or what?”



He shrugged the tiniest bit and turned himself away from me. “Or there’s something to that curse.”



“Oh.” I said. “You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me.”



He turned and lifted his arms in surrender and looked straight into my eyes. “I swear on anything and everything, this wasn’t me. We’ve been friends for a long time, and I know I can be a bit unpredictable. A dick, I guess, sometimes. But I fucking swear, I *promise*. This. Wasn’t. Me.”



I looked at him, then back down the hallway to the statue.



“Uhh, dude?”



“What?”



“Where’s the statue?”



I was hoping it was a trick of the light. Or maybe we’d picked it up in fervor and just forgot. But nope, it was just *gone*.



“Dude… what the fuck,” Case said.



Something between fear and rage overtook me, and as if in defiance of whatever powers were playing with me–earthly or something else entirely– I stomped back down the hall, swaying my head from side to side, checking to see what had happened. Hoping to find some logical explanation. 



I didn’t see it anywhere. Trevor snored, and at that point it felt wrong to keep him dreaming. Something was happening, and he should know. And maybe–just maybe–he’d just been pulling the prank of a lifetime all this time.



“Trevor! Wake up,” I said, shaking him by his shoulder.



“Uhh, what? What?” he groveled, halfway asleep. “What’s going on?”



“Something really fucking weird,” I said.



“What *weird*?”



“Well,” I said, pausing for a moment for Trevor’s eyes to focus. “The statue that Case bought from the antique store, it’s not here. I mean it was here, and then it moved, and now it’s not there anymore. Or where it was. It moved.”



Trevor sat up and rubbed his knuckles on his eyes, then sighed. “So… Case is fucking with you.”



“It’s not me,” Case said, walking up next to us. “I fucking swear dude.”



“You swear on anything, anywhere, anytime.”



“Listen,” I said, coming between them, and looking into Trevor’s eyes. “If this is Case’s doing, he’s got a whole fucking team doing it, and with the precision of fucking Catwoman. I’ve been with him the whole time. He’s not fucking with me, not this time.”



Trevor stood up, looked around the room. He looked quite silly just in his boxers and hoodie, obviously trying to figure out the level of worried he should be. How dire the situation was.



He nodded. “Well, fuck. I knew that something was wrong with that fucking thing. So, what do we do?”



“We look for the statue, I guess,” I said.



“Shouldn’t we, like, fuck off from here?”



“We’re not gonna fuck off because of a ghost,” Case butted in. 



“Well, it’s not technically a ghost. It’s a fucking weird, lanky creature that’s supposedly out to kill me,” I said.



“Kill you?” Trevor asked.



“Yeah. It’s a whole thing. I’ll tell you later. Case isn’t fucking with us, but he definitely fucked up.”



“What the fuck, Case?”



“Dude,” Case said. “Let’s just fucking deal with this, okay. I thought it’d be funny.”



“You thought cursing your friend with some fucked-up Hungarian statue would be *funny*?”



“Guys!” I yelled and clapped my hands, which got their attention. “Let’s just figure out what to do, and beat each other's asses later, okay?”



They both grumbled something like an agreement. 



We spent the rest of the night looking for the statue, going through every corner. Turning pillows, looking inside the actual pillowcases, moving furniture. We gave the gist of what Case had done and the whole story about the creature to Trevor while we were at it.



The place looked like we’d been robbed by the time we gave up. The sun was starting to come up, bathing the apartment in a gleeful yellow, tamped by the curtains and drawn blinds.



We all sat down on the couch, tired and annoyed. At least those feelings, and the simple act of doing something with a purpose and nothing else weird happening, made the initial fear and anger subside a bit. Like it was all a bad dream. Something I could tell at campfires as a ghost story.



“So, it's not here,” I said.



“Duh,” Case said. I gave him a look: *you don’t get to say that.*



“What else can we do?”



“Well,” Trevor said, his eyes already halfway shut. “Maybe nothing. I mean, this supposed creature hasn’t come and eaten your insides. All that’s happened is some creepy shit, and now that creepy shit’s missing.”



“Maybe,” I said, but that didn’t mean I could sleep the next night without some pills to accompany the booze. 



“Occam’s razor,” Case said. “With what we know, Trevor is probably more-or-less right. Besides, my brain’s too mushy and hungover to think of anything else at this point.”



“I’d still like to do something.”



Case made a face, and his eyes burrowed into me. “Do what?”



“Hey, you have no fucking right to be mad at me,” I said, then took a breath. “Can we… I dunno. Undo the curse?”



Case shrugged. “I dunno.”



“Well, fucking Google it,” Trevor said. “Jesus, couldn’t either of you have come up with this like, two hours ago?”



Case lifted up his middle finger at Trevor, but he had the tiniest smile on him. “Fuck you.” He took out his phone, the bags under his eyes extra dark in the blue light.



Trevor fell asleep soon after, still sitting up. Case was still reading, until he said “Oh.”



“Oh?” I asked.



“So I went from the site that had the thing about the creature and searched for whatever came up. Anyway, according to the lore of the time, to get rid of a curse given to you by a witch… you need to curse the witch back.”



“Ooh-kay. That sounds way too easy.”



“I mean, yes and no. Back then the regular people were so against all the black magic or whatever that, were they to do a curse, it’d basically mean exile or death. That you’re one of the witches, y’know. Plus, I’m assuming it needs to be a real curse.”



“Well, I’m not a villager from the year fifteen-fucking-fifty-two, so I’m not going to get killed for being witchy. And I don’t mind cursing you.”



“What?” Case said, finally putting his phone down.



“Let’s just figure out a curse. A *real* curse. You know, something that’s not too bad. And then I’ll curse you, and you’ll deal with it, and that’s that.”



“I don’t want to get cursed.”



“Well, me either, but I didn’t even get to choose that, did I?”



“It’s probably not even a real curse,” Case said. He reminded of a kid throwing a tantrum.  “Nothing’s gonna happen.”



“How do you know? Besides, how would you know if the curse I’d put on you wouldn’t be the same? Just some bumps in the night and you’re sorted, and then we’d both be fine.”



Case straightened out his spine and stretched his shoulders wide. “Look, man. I don’t think it’s cool of you to go and curse me with whatever. I’m not okay with that.”



“Well I’m not okay with you already cursing me! Are you hearing yourself?”



“How was I supposed to know if it was real?”



“You bled on a fucking stick and stole my hair! What the fuck do you mean?”



“This is stupid,” Case said, and got up to leave.



“What, you’re just walking away?”



“Dude, let’s just talk this through in the morning.”



“It *is* morning,” I snapped.



“You know what I mean.” He sighed and walked towards his room. “Look, you’ll be fine, nothing more’s gonna happen, and we can forget about this. I’ll buy you a beer tomorrow, okay?”



Before I could answer, he’d shut the door.



I tried to get some sleep, but every little sound (Trevor snoring, the wind blowing, the walls creaking) brought my heart that much closer to my chest. Maybe I fell asleep for a while, but I felt like I was awake through it. Never not outside myself. My muscles not quite relaxed at any point.



I got up when I heard Trevor going to the bathroom. It was a bit past 1 PM. My head throbbed.



“Hey,” I said.



“Hey. Slept at all?”



“Nah.”



“Figures.”



He seemed a bit annoyed, like a kid who got caught up between their parents having a fight. 



Before I even knew what I was going to say, the words spilled out. “I think I’ll go for a walk.”



He said “Sure.” I thought Trevor would ask questions, or even tell me not to, but he didn’t. Probably because he didn’t know what I was actually going to do. But I did. 



Or maybe he just didn’t care.



I showered and brushed my teeth quickly, hoping that Case wouldn’t get up before I left. I really didn’t want to see him for at least a few more hours, and going out was a good excuse to do just that. The *only* excuse, besides staying in my room I guess, which would’ve been infinitely worse.



As I put on my shoes, I could hear sounds from Case’s room. I got out before he did. 



The city was bright like freshly sharpened knives, pricking at my hungover, sleep-addled mind with its hustle and bustle. But at least I could breathe, and the strangers around me, living their lives as they always did, gave some respite to the still fear of last night that I seemed to drag behind me with each step, nipping at my heels.



I stopped for a coffee and some breakfast on the way. The coffee was sweet and mildly warm, going down smooth, trying its best to jolt me awake. The sandwich tasted good until I tried swallowing, and each bite was like a firecracker waiting to burst out with a splattering of bile. I finished half of it and breathed slowly.



I found my way back to the antique store. This time, an older man stood at the register. He didn’t look up when I entered.



I wasn’t exactly sure what I was looking for. What even is a cursed object? How would I know when I found one? And even if I did, how do I know it would actually curse someone, and how?



As I picked up things and put them back down, I started to feel really stupid. Maybe Case was right: maybe it was just a fluke. That I’d be fine and the curse wasn’t really a curse and there exists no ancient monster thirsty for my blood. And it started to feel like it, like he just might be correct. A fading nightmare, cracking open in the sunlight, exposing the ridiculousness of it all. Burning to nothing under the dome of reality.



There was an assortment of candle holders on a shelf, big and small, silver and tarnished gold. The way they were placed drew my eye, like dancers on a stage. And the stage: a dark brown rectangle made of splintered wood, painted with a familiar pattern.



I moved the candle holders out of the way, revealing it bit by bit. It was the oldest, most haunted looking ouija board I’d ever seen. I’m not kidding when I say it looked like a prop from a movie, stained and worn and entirely captivating to look at.



It held quite a bit of weight when I picked it up. It wasn’t as thick as a cutting board, but close. And the wood was one whole piece, perhaps maple, not curved in the slightest. It didn’t have a price tag, which was unsurprising. Maybe all the cursed things were missing a price tag. At least that would make finding them a lot easier.



And when I touched it, it just felt… bad. Like rot and decay and the slightest feeling of oncoming doom.



What was obvious was that I wasn’t going to find anything more cursed than this, so I took it to the counter. The man behind it first looked at the ouija board, then lifted his eyes up to meet mine.



“No sale,” he said with a thick accent.



“Huh?”



“No sale,” the man repeated, just a bit louder than before. He took the ouija board and placed it under the counter. “Sorry. Maybe something else for you?”



“Why can’t you sell it?” I asked.



“It is part of store. Not supposed to be for sale, so no sale.”



“I can pay.” I took my wallet out, taking out a chunk of bank notes. “I can pay extra.”



The man waved his hands and shook his head. “Sorry.”



I let out a sigh and put the wallet back in my pocket. “Okay, so do you have something else like that?”



“Wooden board? Yes. Many cutting board, serving plate, other board.”



“No, no. I mean, like *that*,” I said, enunciating with the hope that the man would get what I was saying. Unfortunately, he stared at me with a confused look on his face.



“Like,” I said. “Like my friend bought a statue last night. From here.”



“Statue?”



“Yeah. Like a small, stone statue. It had this long… monster or animal or something.”



“Oh,” the man said, and took the smallest step away from the counter, letting his eyes fall somewhere else. Thinking.



“So. Something like *that*.”



The man shook his head, but still didn’t look at me. Like he was running through something in his head. Finally, he sighed and looked me in the eyes again. “Is it gone?”



“Gone? What do you mean?”



“Is statue gone now?”



“Well… yeah. It got lost soon after we got it. Wait, why do you ask?”



“Lost?” the man said, ignoring my question.



“Yeah, it was misplaced or maybe stolen or something,” I lied.



He looked at me, his eyes squinting ever so slightly. I think my hands were trembling a bit, and I suddenly had an insatiable need to swallow, but I fought not to.



“Who?” he said. “Who did it?”



“Did what?”



“You are taken now. Taken by it. I can see. Who did it? It is important to know who did it.”



“What do you mean–”



The man slammed his palms on the counter. “Who did it?”



“Shit, okay. Okay. It was my friend. The guy who bought it.”



“Okay. Where is your friend from?”



“Uhh, we’re all from London. Tourists.”



The man lifted his palms from the counter, leaned back and rubbed his chin idly. “How he know?”



“Know what?”



“Know how to do it. Make you taken. I know what has happened now. You do not need to lie. Did someone teach him? Help him? Is he who you think he is? Is he really your friend?”



“Geez,” I exhaled. “Yeah he’s my friend. I’ve known him forever. He just looked it up online. You know, the… the ritual, I guess. Whatever you’d call it. Wait, what do you mean *taken*?”



“Okay,” he said. “Okay. I believe you.”



He lifted the ouija board back up and spread his arms. “This not help you. Maybe help, but more likely you get in more trouble.”



“Okay. So what do I do?”



The man shrugged. “Wait. Hope it does not succeed.”



Not the answer I was looking for. “Or I curse him back.”



He looked away for a moment and squinted, slowly letting his gaze fall back on me. “Yes. That should work.”



“So. Can you help me with that? Hence the ouija board and all.”



He sighed. “Normally, no. But I do not know why that statue was out. I don’t know how it was sold. It shouldn’t have been for sale. And not this board either. Shouldn’t be out. Or here, either thing. But I feel responsibility for this situation. So I will help you to break the curse. But after that, I can no longer help.”



“Great,” I said. Only then did some higher level of tiredness escape me, revealing a slightly more critically persuasive part of my brain. It said, *what the fuck have you gotten yourself into?*



But I ignored it. I would reconvene with it once this was dealt with and I got some sleep. 



“You do not need an object. But here’s what you can do…”



The man gave me instructions which seemed suspiciously simple. If I did it right, he said, it would curse the target with bad luck for a year. He said it should be enough, and the effects wouldn’t “ruin his life.” He insinuated that there are curses that could do exactly that.



I thanked him and walked out into the now blistering sun. 



The thought that it was all just a bunch of bullshit never quite went away, but also… fuck it. I might as well perform a little curse, just for safety. Because either curses are real, and this would save me from some malicious evil witch-pet, or they’re not, and none of it mattered. 



I went inside a shitty looking cafe a few blocks off, away from the busy streets. I ordered a steaming coffee, sat down, and drank it quickly. The roof of my mouth went numb. 



I put the cup inside my bag and walked to the handicap toilet. I locked the door behind me, and twisted the handle a couple times to make sure it wasn’t broken or loose.



The man at the antique store said it should be done somewhere quite dark. In the bathroom it was nearly pitch black, but I still needed to see, so I took my phone out, tapped the torch on and placed it on a paper towel on the floor, pointing upwards. The bluish light made the dust look like sprinkles floating in the air. I took the coffee cup from my bag and held it before me with both hands.



I looked into the mirror above the sink, breathed in deep, closed my eyes, and exhaled, counting to ten. Then, I began the ritual. 



First, I opened my eyes slowly and looked into my reflection. I stared into my own eyes, each blink slow and meditative, until the shape of my face began to malform. I pictured a flood of darkness growing just beyond my reflection, like a dam. I don’t know how long I did this for.



Once I no longer recognized myself (and frankly got quite scared of my own reflection), I spit into the coffee cup, still looking at the mirror. With my right index finger, I swirled the thick mucus in a circular motion. Three times right, two times left, four times right.



Then I closed my eyes and dropped the cup on the floor, smashing it into pieces. Then I ducked, still keeping my eyes closed, so I was no longer in the reflection. When I opened my eyes, I was very careful not to look at the mirror. The man hadn’t said why, but that was the one thing he insisted on.



Slowly, I picked up the pieces of porcelain, and carefully put them in the bin. Still crawling, I picked up my phone and bag, made my way to the door, and exited awkwardly into the cafe. A man was waiting outside, confused and annoyed. He said something pointed but I just booked it out of there.



Things felt different as I walked out onto the street. Before, it was like I’d been looking up at a huge tidal wave rolling towards me, blacking out the sun. Readying to swallow me; bludgeon my body into red and yellow pulp.



Now it was like I was inside the wave. Calm and steady. And whatever came upon me, I would crush like it was nothing. 



I wanted to do something, but I wasn’t sure what. Talk to a stranger, drink something weird, get into a fight. But the unfounded confidence became a burden as I found no place for an outlet, so I decided to just head back to the AirBnB and see if it held up. As I walked, I fantasized about how I would act around him: all confident, not scared at all. Not like a little bitch, as he had insinuated.



When I opened the door, I could hear the rapping rain of someone cooking with oil. I made my way in, my shoulders squared and my chin level. It was Trevor, cooking up some eggs. I was a bit disappointed not to see Case around.



“Hey,” he said. “Good walk?”



“Uhh, yeah. Got some breakfast.”



“Cool. Where’d you go?”



At first, I thought he was asking about the antique store. That he’d somehow known. But he couldn’t have, so I acted casual.



“Some cafe, can’t remember its name. Wasn’t that good.”



“They can’t all be winners, right?” Trevor said, giving me an apologetic smile. 



“Guess so.” I returned the smile. “Hey, where’s Case by the way?”



“I think he’s still sleeping.”



“Still?”



“I know, right?”



I shrugged and looked at the eggs. They looked delicious, and I wanted to grab them off the pan with my bare hands. Let the oil scald my mouth and the yolk run down my throat, coating it. The feeling was almost arousing, so I forced my mind someplace else.



“I’ll go wake him up,” I said.



“Uhh, sure,” Trevor said. “You’re not gonna fight again, are you?”



“Nah. We’re good. Just thought we shouldn’t maybe let him sleep the whole day away.”



“Fair.”



Case’s room was quiet from the outside. I knocked and called his name. Then again, and a third time. No answer.



“Must be dead asleep,” Case yelled from the kitchen.



I turned the handle and slowly opened the door. It was dark. The old, worn blinds only let enough light through to paint thin lightsabers around the walls. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust. 



Case was in the bed, tucked under the covers. I couldn’t see his face. I called on him again. Told him to get up, that it was late. 



I stepped inside the room, and the lightsabers flickered out, but the blinds didn’t move. A creak came from behind me, and as I turned I saw the door latch shut. An unnatural darkness, like the sky without the stars, enveloped everything. The confidence I’d had didn’t drop away fully, but it was challenged by something. By fear, distilled into needles, pushing into my arms with pinpricks that made my skin crawl and the hairs stand up.



Something swooshed and thumped behind me. I turned back around, and saw two red spots light up near the roof. Eyes. They glimmered, casting ambient light and faint shadow down below. Staring at me.



Around them, a mangled face. Skin stretched and ripped to accommodate the large, round eyes. Below, a set of sharp teeth, gnawing at the undersized lips, drooling with spit and bright red.



And below, the ragdoll body of Case, still wrapped up in his pajamas. His legs didn’t reach the floor. He was floating. 



The thing opened its mouth and murmured through its ragged mouth, trying to piece something together, but it came out as a wet grumble.



I said something. I don’t remember what, or how loud, but it was loud enough that Trevor ran in. He stopped behind me, and the light of the hallway pushed in like a thousand neon yellowjackets, giving form to Case. To what he’d become. 



“Holy shit. What the fuck. Fuck! *Fuckfuckfuck*,” Trevor screamed, his breath stealing syllables from the words.



The floating thing bellowed a scream that sounded like it was tearing Case’s lungs apart, pushing them to the point of blowing up. 



In the span of less than a second, it turned around and pushed itself headfirst through the blinds and through the window. A crash so loud it could cut, followed by a splat.



The fire alarm went off. Trevor’s eggs were burning, and he said something obscene and ran back to the kitchen.



I stood, staring at the yellow light pouring through the broken window, sliced in odd angles by the crooked and broken blinds. We were on the second story, but it was still quite high up. I thought Case was dead. That something irreversible and horrible had just happened, and I was just waiting for it to resolve. For the next scene to begin, the one where I had to explain to Hungarian cops how our friend died. And why they had big, red eyes.

I turned 42 in September of 2013 and I had a wonderful life at this time with my husband of almost 25 years of two wonderful sons ages 20 and 23 both of which were still at home. fast forward just 2 months and my life was turned upside down with the first and worst tragedy of losing my husband in a tragic accident. fast forward 2 years and i think i am so lucky i find another wonderful man, how can i get so lucky to find love not once but twice. well i blame my stupidity on the fact that i met the love of my life at age 16 married at 17 so i had no experience at all with dating so I like an idiot just thought all men were like my first husband but I was so wrong. I married my second love and I really did love him and about 4 months in came my second tragedy. It was valentines and we went out and we got a room and everything. well we went to the bar and were drinking and dancing. I was really having a good time drinking and dancing which is something i didn't do with my first husband and always thought i was missing something by not getting to go dancing, he just wasn't into that kind of stuff. Anyway a fun night soon changed as we were walking to our room and i was falling down because of drinking way too much but then this man  came up and helped my husband walk me to our room. I only have flashes of memories that still haunt me to this day and the main one is me on my back with this man on top of me having sex with me and my head turned to the right and i see my husband in a chair watching and the look in his eyes i cant even explain but he was definitely enjoying himself. my next memory is my husband in my face forcing himself inside my mouth. I must have completely passed out after that because next it is morning and I woke up in bed beside my husband naked as if nothing happen. I sit up and the memories stat to come back in flashes. i was drunk enough that i did not nor ever will remember everything that happen to me but as the horrible memories come back in  flashes that morning i first get up and puke and not because of the alcohol. I then got a shower which i felt like i could never get clean enough. when i get out my husband had got dressed and went down to get himself coffee and smoke and came back acting all normal like nothing was wrong and i just start screaming at him, asking how and why. I was so confused that i started to doubt my own memories but he tells me that he asked me if i wanted that and i said yes. i say to him what do you mean i said yes i was so drunk i couldn't walk how could i say yes to having sex with a total stranger and besides that why would you want that what is wrong with you. I keep saying to myself was this my fault i should not have drank so much but I was with my husband, with no driving so i felt 100% safe,  I was sexually assaulted but was it my fault? I spent the next year in a deep depression and got hooked on pain killers while staying with my husband. I finally realized if i didn't get help with my addiction I was going to end up killing myself but I think part of me wanted that but luckily my two sons was there and only for them I got help and then after getting clean i realized I had to leave the sick man that caused all this pain in my life, I finally get my freedom and my first husbands name back because that was so important to me i had that last name for most of my life and knew that's who i was but even my mom said i did all of that to myself so maybe i got what i deserved and it really was my fault",1,1757272019.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

Yesterday I had a strong coffee for the first time in two weeks before work and the minor spasms were there like normal. but last night they got worse when I was trying to sleep again. My leg muscles will slowly start to spasm while falling asleep and it feels like, as I’m getting close to knocking out, I’ll get a bigger spasm in my legs and pulse to my brain or at time it would be my whole body and it would jolt me awake. followed by this scared feeling. Just like before.

i have left over gabapentin from the time before last when I went to the hospital, and took it last night and it helped me finally sleep. I was wondering if anyone here has been in a similar situation, where certain things like coffee or weed would bring back the spasms or how long they will take to finally go away? Even as I type I’m having the little spasms.

Edit: I said weed because in the middle of last week I did take a weed gummy instead of the medication and had the same results as when I drank the coffee yesterday ",1,1757271902.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False
1nb1ran,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainfuelcoStudio/comments/1nb1ran/i_built_a_productivity_system_for_when_youre/,I built a productivity system for when you’re running on 2 brain cells and caffeine ☕,"Hey folks 👋, I’m the creator behind *Brainfuelco*.

Quick backstory: I was tired (literally) of all those productivity systems that assume you’re a morning person who loves 5 a.m. runs, bulletproof coffee, and a color-coded Google Calendar. Meanwhile, I was over here fighting burnout, procrastination, and the occasional *“why am I like this?”* spiral.

So instead of forcing myself into rigid schedules, I started designing my days around something more real: **energy**.

I built a Notion system that doesn’t care what time it is - it cares about how much gas you’ve got in the tank. Tasks, meals, workouts, even flashcards all get tagged by how much energy they cost. Then you just hit one of three modes:

* **Power ⚡** (high energy, deep work)
* **Balance ⚖️** (moderate energy, everyday stuff)
* **Recharge 🛌** (low energy, easy wins)

The result? You actually get things done without burning out or feeling guilty for “not sticking to the plan.”

I’ll be posting here about productivity, burnout, and staying on track when you feel like you’re dying inside: with some humor, because let’s be honest, half of us are just winging it anyway.

Excited to share, learn, and maybe help someone else who’s in the same boat 🚤.

I’ve been having extreme pain during sex for over 7 months now, and have been attending pelvic floor physical therapy and using dilators and everything they tell me to do. Same story I’m sure many of you have experienced, doctors never “finding” anything, telling me to take ibuprofen, months and months of appointments with no answers. My partner and I haven’t had sex in months, which he says is ok because he doesn’t want me to be in pain but I know we’re both really struggling with it. We don’t have oral sex anymore because the thought of our sex life never going back to “normal” makes us so sad and hopeless.

I scheduled my laparoscopy for Sept.29th after a severe flare-up made me miss a week of school and work. I was going to wait until October but I’m in so much pain I can’t stand it. No caffeine (coffee is one of my favorite things), no alcohol, nothing. My job is very labor-intensive (industrial cook) and there’s a possibility I won’t be able to work for a month following the procedure because of the lifting restrictions.

I’m looking forward to the possibility of not being in so much pain and being able to have sex again, but what if they don’t find anything? What if they do the procedure, I have to pay for it, I can’t work for a month and it’s not endometriosis? I’m so tired of living with the pain and frustration of not knowing what’s wrong, the thought of all of this STILL being a mystery makes me sick.

I guess I don’t know what I want by posting this. My partner is amazing and supportive but I know he doesn’t really understand how crushing this all is. 

How can I prepare myself for the laparoscopy, especially in the event they don’t find anything? How do I cope with no one having answers for me? I feel so lost and I know you all have felt the same. Anything helps, even a picture of your pet looking silly.

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue. I've also found to connect deeply with others through the means of massaging. It's a very profound experience to have and I found myself opening up more to the idea of relieving others of their stress to be satisfying for both parties!

About me: 28, 5'6"", latino, i thoroughly enjoy exercising, watching and identifying birds, jazz clubs, museum visitations, and movie watching. I'm in Brooklyn (can't host, unfortunately), but can easily make my way to you or a place to meetup. I'd love to talk over a sip or a coffee/tea. Feel free to ask any questions.

I'd be willing to travel after we talk a bit and you can host. :)

1nb1nh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1nb1nh3/explore_the_best_single_serve_espresso_machine/,Explore the Best Single Serve Espresso Machine Nespresso Vertuo Next,"Sipping coffee has always been my morning ritual, and over the past three months, the Nespresso ENV120BCA Vertuo Next machine has become a pivotal part of that routine. As a coffee lover who thrives on simplicity and variety, this machine immediately drew my attention with its sleek design and promise of versatility. A cup of espresso one morning, a mug of strong coffee the next, and a smooth double espresso in the afternoon—this machine caters to it all, and I’ve put it to the test quite thoroughly.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Aesthetically, the streamlined design and classy rose gold accents blend effortlessly with my kitchen’s interior. Standing at just 12.8 inches tall and 5.59 inches wide, it fits snugly on my counter without hogging precious space. Nespresso also boasts that the machine is made with 50% recycled plastic, which is a nice touch for environmentally conscious users. While it feels sturdy overall, the capsule compartment could be just a tad more robust; it occasionally feels less durable when ejecting the used pods.

**Ease of Use and Customization**  
What stands out with this coffee machine is its user-friendly operation. A single button does it all. Truly, there’s no fumbling at 6 a.m. when I’m groggy-eyed and in desperate need of caffeine. It reads the unique barcode on each recyclable capsule, brewing the coffee to perfection without the guesswork. Its ability to make seven different cup sizes, ranging from a petite espresso to a pour-over style carafe, is one of my favorite features. The system’s fully automatic nature has made my mornings smooth, though I’d have appreciated a slightly faster brewing time when making larger mugs.

**Merits**  
• Stylish and compact design suitable for small kitchens  
• Offers seven cup sizes for varied coffee preferences  
• Fully automatic functionality with simple one-button operation  

[Check Nespresso ENV120BCA Vertuo Next price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b0866qtz3n/)

**Technological Features**  
The tech-savvy aspects of this machine shouldn’t go unnoticed. Built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities ensure that my machine stays updated with the latest software, which is particularly appealing to someone like me who enjoys being on the cutting edge of convenience. I initially thought this was just a gimmick, but after noticing how seamless the brewing process has been, I realized its value. This connectivity, paired with the efficient capsule recognition, ensures that every shot of espresso or cup of coffee comes out aromatic and topped with a creamy layer of crema—a delightful touch for anyone who appreciates the art of coffee.

**Sustainability and Maintenance**  
Sustainability is another feather in the cap for this machine. The coffee capsules are recyclable, and Nespresso offers options for returning the used capsules for proper recycling. As someone aiming to reduce waste at home, I found this effort admirable. Maintenance is fairly minimal, with an easy-to-clean drip tray and no constant descaling required. However, I will note that the reliance on proprietary capsules means you can’t pop in any random coffee pod, which adds some recurring expense to ownership.

**Areas for Improvement**  
• Capsule compartment feels slightly flimsy  
• Reliance on proprietary Nespresso pods limits choice  
• Brewing time can feel slow for larger cup sizes  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this machine to other single-serve brewers like the Keurig K-Elite, the differences are distinct. While Keurig machines are less expensive and offer compatibility with various pod brands, the depth of flavor and crema the Nespresso Vertuo Next provides is unmatched. On the premium end, Breville produces excellent single-serve espresso machines, but they often lack the versatility in cup sizes that this model delivers. The standout feature of the Vertuo Next remains its elegance in simplicity—seamlessly bridging functionality and style.

**Value for Money**  
Affordability isn’t its strongest suit, but the quality aligns well with the price point. If you’re like me and willing to spend a bit more for consistently high-quality coffee and sleek technology, this investment is worthwhile. But bear in mind, the continual purchase of proprietary pods can tally up the cost over time. Despite that, I’ve found the rich, velvety coffee to be worth every sip.

The truth is: yes, you *can* make real money on eBay. Exact earnings vary widely by effort, strategy, niche, and tools, but here are some real-world examples to consider:

1. **Flea Market Flipper** Rob and Melissa, known as *Flea Market Flipper*, turned an $80 flea market find into $1,750 on eBay—later revealing they earned nearly **$100,000 in a single year** from flipping alone. [The Sun](https://www.the-sun.com/money/11032660/thrifted-old-fashioned-kitchen-essential-ebay-brand/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Kirsty – “selling actual rubbish”** Kirsty collected discarded items and sold them on eBay, earning **£8,000 in one year**, simply by spotting resale potential in overlooked items.

3. **Luke Warder – full-time flipper** Luke quit his 9-to-5 and focused on reselling secondhand clothing, making around **£50,000 in one year**—he flipped a £40 suit for £1,000 and a £10 football kit for £150. [The Scottish Sun](https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/money/15199003/quit-job-sell-ebay-make-thousands-tips/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
4. **Kelsey Mikula – monthly income** Kelsey, who began reselling clothing while at university, now earns about **$12,000 per month** (that's over **$140,000 per year**) across platforms like eBay, Mercari, and Poshmark. [New York Post](https://nypost.com/video/woman-resells-her-clothes-for-profit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
5. **Average sellers (U.S. data)**
   * ZipRecruiter reports that U.S. eBay resellers earn an average of **$69,310 per year**, with most earning between $40,500 and $77,000, and top 10% reaching **$153,500**. [LitCommerce](https://litcommerce.com/blog/top-sellers-on-ebay/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   * LitCommerce notes averages around **$35,000 annually**, with hourly earnings ranging from **$13 to $29**, and top performers hitting up to **$48.80/hour**. [LitCommerce](https://litcommerce.com/blog/how-to-make-money-on-ebay/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
6. **Hustle at Home Mom & ProDuoFlippers**
   * A Hustle at Home Mom generated over **$52,000 in sales** from 1,400+ clothing items.
   * ProDuoFlippers made over **$125,000 in revenue** during their first full year, netting about **$50,000 in profit** after expenses. [One More Cup of Coffee |](https://onemorecupof-coffee.com/how-much-money-make-ebay/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
7. **Dropshipping margins** For those using dropshipping, profit margins typically sit between **10%–30%**, but clever sourcing can push that as high as **60%**—though fees do reduce net profit. [Ippei](https://ippei.com/is-ebay-dropshipping-profitable/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What This Means for You

* **Part-time sellers** (weekend hobbies, occasional flips): expect a few thousand dollars annually.
* **Study-month-level earners** (like Kelsey): can make five-figure income pretty consistently, crossing into six figures with volume.
* **Full-time, scale-minded resellers**: some exceed £50–100k/year, especially using niche products or strategic sourcing.
* **Dropshippers** can maintain decent margins, but it's sensitive to cost and competition.

# Community Voices

Even within communities, the range is massive. One Reddit user estimated they took a brand-new store from **$0 to $10,000/month** in just three months—driven by photography, item specifics, and presentation. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/lp5z4f?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# How AI Supercharges Your Growth

Listing and selling more can dramatically boost your income—but doing it manually caps you fast. That’s where AI tools like ListEasier shine:

* **Faster listing**: AI handles titles, descriptions, categories, and specifics in minutes.
* **Better SEO**: Optimized listings lead to more visibility, faster sales, and higher sell-through.
* **Scalability**: List 50–100 items per day instead of 5–10, meaning you can match (or exceed) those top-earner incomes sooner.
* **Consistency**: AI ensures every listing meets high standards—critical as you scale beyond hobby-level profits.

In essence, part-time sellers can cross into full-time income territory, and full-timers can turbocharge their growth—without burning out.

**Bottom Line**: eBay can be profitable—but results depend on your strategy, consistency, and workflow. With AI tools, you’re not just earning more, you’re multiplying your earning potential.",1,1757271495.0,eBayStars,0,1.0,False
1nb1kug,https://i.redd.it/qkmwmxzyhsnf1.png,A Canadian in All 50 States: A Reflective Odyssey,"I grew up Canadian, and maybe that’s why the United States always shimmered for me with a kind of exotic allure. Not exotic like the spice markets of Marrakesh or the temples of Kyoto, but exotic because it was *so close*. It was across a river, a stretch of highway, a line on a map. We lived near the border, and for our family vacations we crossed into America the way some people cross a threshold into a dream. Every trip south felt like stepping into a vast stage set, where the cars were bigger, the soda cups endless, and even the motel signs seemed to hum with neon possibility.

For me, the U.S. wasn’t just geography—it epitomized travel. It was a land I could measure not by distance but by states, each one a new chapter. Long before I knew I’d be a writer, long before I put pen to page about Russia or North Korea, I was a kid peering out the window of our family car at American billboards, mesmerized.

That seed of wonder never left me. And years later, it grew into something bigger than a vacation. It became a personal odyssey: to drive, wander, and drift through all fifty states of the Union.

# The Lower 48: A Long Road, A Long Dream

When people talk about traveling the U.S., they usually mean a handful of cities. Maybe a cross-country road trip. A taste of Route 66, a selfie with the Grand Canyon, a Broadway ticket stub. That’s good enough for most. But I wanted something else. I wanted the whole story—or at least as much of it as a person could see from behind the wheel.

So in one great sweep, a friend and I drove the **lower 48 states**. That’s right—48 states in one trip, without skipping, without cheating, without pretending that crossing the corner of a panhandle counted. We drove them. We lived them. 24,000 miles, sleeping in my 1978 Corolla in rest areas, closed roads, or behind gas stations. We washed storefront windows for gas money and food. 

And here’s the kicker: we’re not talking in terms of famous travel writers. Jack Kerouac, the beat generation’s restless son, hitchhiked through 17 states. Bill Bryson, with all his wit and detail, managed 38. Both are celebrated as great American travel authors. And yet, quietly, without much fanfare, we did 48 in one fell swoop, every state in the continental U.S.

To say it was a road trip is too small. It was a rolling classroom, a kaleidoscope, a test of patience and of joy.

# The Road Teaches You

On the road, America teaches you in its own accents.

It teaches you about hospitality in the South, where a stranger still calls you “hon.”  
It teaches you about resilience in the Rust Belt, where the factories have shuttered but the people haven’t given up.  
It teaches you about scale in the West, where the horizon swallows you whole and the mountains look painted by a God with an oversized brush.

We ate in diners with menus laminated against decades of spilled coffee. We ran across the helipad on top of Trump Casino in Atlantic City, we snuck into a Kenny Rogers concert in Oklahoma City, and we watched Misery in a theatre in Upstate New York. We met people who spoke like cousins we never knew we had.

And through it all, the car—my 5-speed—became a character in its own right. There’s something about driving across endless interstates, through deserts and forests, that fuses man to machine. My car was more than steel; it was a partner. In the years and some twenty vehicles since, my WRX has taken on that symbolic role, the drift-car that breaks theoretical physics, but on that great odyssey, whatever I was driving was simply the means to make America unfold like a living map.

# Alaska, 1999

We finished the 48, but two remained—those outer states, dangling like commas: Alaska and Hawaii.

In 1999, I drove to Alaska. And driving there is no small thing. Alaska humbles you. It’s a place where the road narrows into something closer to survival than travel. It isn’t just distance—it’s remoteness. Mountains that remind you how small you are, forests that look eternal, rivers that are less like water and more like geography in motion.

When I reached Alaska, I knew this wasn’t about checking boxes. This was about honoring the scale of the planet and the audacity of human travel. It was about the boy who once crossed the border to buy an ice cream in America, now driving into the farthest reaches of its territory.

# Hawaii: The Final State

And now, as I write this, Hawaii is next. It will be my 50th state. The final piece of the mosaic. Not the hardest to reach, but somehow the most symbolic. Because Hawaii isn’t a drive. It’s a flight, a crossing, a leap into the Pacific. It feels like the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence I began decades ago.

# Why It Matters

Maybe you’re wondering: why does this matter? Why count states like coins, why measure travel in borders crossed?

For me, it’s about continuity. I am, to my knowledge, the only Canadian travel writer of the so-called “big five” who’s done all 50. Kerouac did 17. John Steinbeck, 27. William Least-Heat Moon, 28. Bryson, 38. The others stopped somewhere along the way. But I finished—because I never stopped feeling that magnetic pull America had for me as a child. To have memories of Kansas, New Orleans, Hell's Kitchen, MIT, Cape Canaveral, Hollywood, Wyoming (my #1 favorite), Chicago, St. Louis, Sante Fe, Miami, Memphis, Mt. Rushmore, Dallas-Fort Worth, North Carolina, all buzzword names in business, travel, film, and American nostalgia, these places have an identity to me.

Travel, in the end, is a mirror. And for me, America has been the clearest mirror I’ve ever peered into. Each state reflecting not just itself, but something about me—my curiosity, my persistence, my delight in strangeness.

# A Travel-Literary Reflection

What I’ve learned is that the U.S. is not one country. It is 50 stories, bound together by highways and history. It is contradictions. It is generosity and suspicion, beauty and ruin, openness and defensiveness.

I’ve also learned that travel writing is not about tallying miles. It’s about memory. I remember:

* The eerie quiet of Pyongyang years later—but I measure it against the eerie quiet of a Nebraska highway at dawn.
* The friendliness of strangers in Arkansas against the wariness of strangers in Manhattan.
* The taste of roadside barbecue in the Carolinas against the plastic tang of a gas-station hot dog in Wyoming.

It all matters. It all lingers.

# Closing the Loop

When I land in Hawaii, I will not just be completing a personal odyssey. I will be closing a loop that began with a boy crossing a border with his family, wide-eyed at the idea that travel was just… right there.

And when I look back across those 50 states, I’ll remember not the map, not the mileage, not the achievement, but the *continuance*. The sense that travel is never done, that the world is always waiting for another border to cross, another road to drift down, another reflection to find.",1,1757271446.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

I’d sit down to work, and suddenly I’d be overwhelmed by distractions, boredom, or just a restless urge to do anything except what needed doing. Turns out, with ADHD, you don’t fix focus by sheer willpower you build your own toolkit.

Here are the weirdest ways I keep myself locked in when I need to get things done:

**Strategic Music for Everything** Different playlists for different energy levels. Upbeat pop for cleaning, lo-fi for focusing, classical for deep work, binaural beats for concentration. I literally have a ""transition song"" that plays between tasks to reset my brain. Noise-cancelling headphones make this 10x more effective.

**Background Audio is Your Friend** Playing true crime podcasts, YouTube videos, or even live court hearings while doing chores tricks my brain into thinking it's multitasking. The chatty part of my mind gets occupied so my body can work on autopilot. It's like having a conversation buddy who never expects me to respond.

**White, Brown, and Pink Noise** Noise generators with good headphones block distractions and calm my racing mind, especially in public spaces. Game changer for coffee shop work sessions.

**Talk to Yourself Out Loud** I verbalize every step while working. ""Now I'm checking this email, then I'll file it here."" Sounds crazy but it keeps my thoughts organized and prevents that mental fog drift.

**The Documentary Narrator Trick** I pretend I'm making a tutorial while doing boring tasks. ""Now I'm loading the dishwasher, making sure to scrape this plate first."" My brain stays engaged and I actually finish things now.

**Engage Multiple Senses** Eating strong mints while watching videos or chewing gum during reading occupies one sense so others can focus better. Counter-intuitive but it works.

**Task Switching Instead of Fighting** Work on two projects at once and switch when focus fades on one. Sounds chaotic but it matches how my brain naturally wants to work.

**Fidget Tools Everywhere** Tangle toys during meetings, stress balls while reading, exercise bands under my desk. Keeping my hands busy helps my mind stay present.

**Physical Reset Between Tasks** I do jumping jacks or touch my toes when switching activities. The movement signals to my brain that we're starting something new.

**Location-Based Brain Training** Desk equals work plus focus music. Bed equals sleep or mindless scrolling only. My brain now automatically switches modes based on where I am.

**The Uniform Method** Specific clothes for different tasks. Apron for cooking, business shirt for work calls, cleaning gloves for deep cleaning. It's like having a work costume that actually works.

Some of these strategies might sound odd to people who have never lived with ADHD, but together, they let me hack my own sense of focus. If you have your own rituals or tricks, please share them. Sometimes the weirdest ideas are the most effective, and you just might have the secret that helps someone else finally feel in control.

What’s the one weird focus hack you swear by? I’d love to try something new.",3,1757271277.0,soothfy,0,1.0,False

- The lamp in the corner i know😭😭 There is no overhead light in living room. I do have a vintage rain lamp coming im getting restored I wanted to hang maybe there  in corner ish

Questions besides all the ‘notes’ 🤦‍♀️
1. What color rug for living room 

2. get rid of yellow chair and put what?? just plants lol??

3. Ideas for above couch 
-- I bought cool art for above my couch but I am thinking the colors clash and not the right vibe??  (added those photos— its the new Orleans style prints last photo) So I am open to thoughts about what to put above. I once thought a large decorative fan but that gives more bedroom vibes? 

4. What color runner rug for hallway? my bathroom is at end of hallway to the right I added a pic for colors / a little more specific pic of hallway art. Could be maximal or simple— Only thought I had was a rug with insects on them? 

5. Coffee table suggestions and size?
-- I HATEE the coffee table and have been on the hunt for something more the vibe.  thinking glass or glass top?

1nb1hdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1nb1hdz/hotel_del_coronado_review/,Hotel del Coronado Review,"Yay, a review! I typically don't share reviews here because I write them for my day job (I run a publication for luxury travel advisors) or am visiting on a complimentary basis. However, this week I stayed at the newly renovated Hotel del Coronado for the Signature Owners' Meeting, a conference for travel agency owners. For reference, I am a Hilton Diamond member, and I don't believe the hotel had any further knowledge of ""who I am,"" other than being booked under the conference rate.

 **TL;DR:** This is an average resort property trying to pass itself off as a luxury hotel.

**Let's start with the good:** The property is beautiful, and the renovation itself appears to be incredibly well-done. I hadn't visited before, but it seems like they've brought the lobby back to its original glory, and I enjoyed looking at the historic photos along the walls. 

The meeting/conference set-up was quite nice, and it's little surprise that MICE is a strong point here, given the sprawling nature of the property. The catering was typical banquet food, but I appreciated the abundance of fresh and local vegetarian options, vegan things at breakfast, and so on.

The ""service"" staff throughout the week was incredible: Alma, in the coffee shop, always had a smile on her face and even remembered my name and order by day two. Wendy, a beach server, somehow knew the names of every guest in her section and was on top of every need. Housekeeping left the room absolutely spotless every day and did a great job of observing when we were or weren't in the room to clean.

**Now, the bad:** We were booked in a room in ""The Views,"" one of the more modern buildings known for its floor-to-ceiling windows and views of, well, the ocean. At check-in, there was no acknowledgment of being a Diamond member, which I really don't care about, but I wanted to confirm the daily F&B credit.

Upon checking in, we were given a room with, literally, a view of a wall, and inexplicably, two beds. I know upgrades aren't always a given, but upon receiving the text asking how my room was, I expressed that it wasn't what I was hoping for, and I was a bit surprised. After receiving no apology or acknowledgement, I inquired about upgrade availability (not even necessarily complimentary ones). Twice, the front desk text agent tried to sell me $500 per night upgrades to some villa suite, saying their manager approved the rate and it was such a great deal. 

Meanwhile, I could see the rooms on the website for an all-in price of less than our offered upgrade. I mentioned that and received no response, nor was there any attempt at service recovery. Fine, as I was too busy working anyway to enjoy the room all that much, and at least enjoyed my morning runs and sunset walks along the beach, which were delightful.

The property is *wildly expensive* for what it is. Wanna go to a place where you'll be charged for literally everything? Come here. Beach beds and umbrellas are nearly $100 for the day. We spent $120 for four tacos and two cocktails by the beach. A latte was $10 with a $1.50 upcharge for non-dairy milk. Think Peninsula prices with a fraction of the quality or high-touch service. I love nice things, and I love paying for them, but there was nothing here, F&B-wise, that left me feeling like it was worth it. 

Rooms have no amenities—no vanity kits, dental kits, razors, etc. I thought that was standardized across Curio, but perhaps I'm wrong there. It was a bit surprising either way. I understand many hotels are trying to save money and minimize waste, but I hate having to call someone to request every little thing. There's also no room service (although you can order take-out from their restaurants, I think?), and the room lacks any materials for resort activities, fitness classes, and other amenities. Don't forget about the $50 per night resort fee, either.

Yesterday, I inquired about a late check-out, as our flight back to New York is a red-eye. I was initially told they could extend me an hour, to 12 pm, and anything else would involve a fee. Gee, thanks. I pushed back a bit, reiterating that I'd been slightly unhappy throughout my stay and no one had made any effort to even follow up, much less make things better. I got them to 1 pm and was told that 2 pm would be subject to a $200 half-day fee. Yes, $200 for an hour. 

I think I've just clearly been spoiled by a summer of a few hotels that I felt really punched above their weight class (looking at you, Kimpton Main Frankfurt!) to make this a pretty big disappointment, from a service perspective.

   Possession can take many forms. Thanks to Hollywood Humans have a pretty good grasp on the basics. It primarily involves a person, animal or object. In many cases it’s easiest to possess whatever is near or the focal point of negativity. The abused and neglected child desperate and vulnerable, the home that has housed decades of family trauma and violence or the doll that is simply a witness to it all. For a Demon it’s far more than just a chance to torment and drag an unlucky soul back into the fires. It’s an opportunity. A chance to prove to all of Hell what you can do while also being able to escape it for as long as you can. The closest thing we have to a miracle.

  I’d introduce myself but my name is unpronounceable by man and I wouldn’t even know where to begin with spelling it. To be honest I haven’t heard it in so long I sometimes forget it. I am a lower ranking demon only permitted in the less actiony sides of Hell. I don’t get to see to the torture of the damned or anything fun. I mainly herd souls and preform the bidding of the higher ranks. Subject to abuse and carrying out tasks no one wants to do like making sure the rivers continue to flow and aren’t being too clogged up from all the bodies stacking up and thrashing desperately in the current. 

   Today Ive been tasked with breaking up large ice formations from relentless rains here in Beelzebub’s territory. One of the most horrifically uncomfortable lords to speak with but I stay on his good side by having an offering ready for every meet. He might not love what you have to offer but he’s not exactly picky either. I watch the damned roam aimlessly through the storm while I chip away at the ice. Eyes frozen shut with the fierce winds peeling back their frostbitten flesh exposing the blackening muscle and bone beneath. If the ice formations get too large the humans will use them to try and escape the elements. Pointless really. I chuckled to myself at their expense. I hacked away at the ice revealing long abandoned fingers, limbs and strips of faces past souls weren’t able to free from the structure’s cold grip. That was when I saw it. A glimmering thread appeared from nowhere just in-front of me.

   These threads are doorways so to speak. A bridge to something from the mortal plane that is essentially available for possession. Exceptionally rare especially in these parts and just within arms reach.. it was beautiful. “HEY”! I snapped my head around. “Don’t you fucking move, Imp”. I had stared for too long, I should’ve known higher ranking demons would be alerted and drawn to its location. I froze, my whole body clenched and vibrating violently with fear and excitement of what could be. If I were to disobey I can’t imagine the suffering I would endure. Once I was through though who could reach me?

   My head felt heavy at the thought but my eyes were forcing my focus on the thread. It’s right here! Right in front of me! The opportunity and escape I’ve yearned for, for centuries. I couldn’t ignore this moment, I had to take the chance and finally become everything I knew I could be. I inhaled sharply and quickly grasped the thread and with my last sight being the absolute rage of the demon rushing towards me everything went dark.

   I felt light as I regained my consciousness. Floating in a pool of blackness when I began to hear distant mumbling. It slowly grew louder, less muffled as I opened my eyes. It was bright and took a moment to focus. “What is.. Where am I?” I looked ahead at a man staring back at me with frustration in his eyes. “COME ON!” He gave a short but forceful shove into me. “Damn thing never works right.” He stormed off. “What the fuck was that about?” I asked myself. I took a moment to focus and learn what I had become a part of. As the full picture of my possession came into view my jaw dropped. “No…NO!…. NO NO NO, FUCK!” It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be! My heart raced with confusion, panic and sheer embarrassment as my situation became more and more clear to me…. It was a coffee machine… I have possessed a God damned coffee machine.

   After a few hours or so of trying to calm myself down I was able to look around and listen to people coming and going and have  drawn the full unfortunate picture of my situation. I am now a large coffee machine in the break room of some machine company. Bearings I think is what I heard they make here. “It’s fine, this is fine” I thought. “I’ll just bail! Return to Hell and explain myself.. They’ll probably all laugh!”But I knew this wouldn’t be the case. 

   To back out of a possession was considered dishonorable. Not that honor exists where I’m from but it was looked at as failure or cowardice. Should I return I’d be subject to tortures and humiliations far worse than what most humans receive. I was stuck here in the decision I’ve made. My thoughts were interrupted by another man staring at me blankly deciding on what type of coffee he wanted. He pressed A3 and a lukewarm black coffee was dispensed. He took a sip, let out a unsatisfied sigh and left. “Maybe… maybe there’s hope here” I thought. It’s not what I had envisioned but there is opportunity here. I just needed to think. “These people… drink from me. I can dictate what they ingest.. I can have a direct effect on them internally!.. Not sure where it could go from there but it’s something”. With this clarity I’ve decided to stick it out and have gained a new excitement for what could be. 

  The first work break of the day has started. A few people sitting around at the lunch tables rambling about their pathetic lives and what a shithole place they think this is. Finally my first target has approached me. An older fat woman breathing heavily and biting her disgusting nails as she looked over her options. “We really need more options in this ol thang”. She chose E4, a cappuccino. Admittedly I was caught off guard a little. I was so taken back by this putrid ogre I hadn’t even thought of a plan for the drink. Quickly I allowed many small and sharp, hair sized, shards of plastic to peel from the dispenser into her coffee. In time my strength will grow but for now it’s the best I can muster. I was so excited watching her I didn’t realize I was holding my breath as she walked back to her table. She took a few sips each one followed by a low grunt clearing her throat. The grunts grew louder and were eventually followed by coughs that became too rough for her to ignore. At this point the whole break room had taken notice. “Excu- *cough* excuse me” she said standing up quickening her pace to the restroom. She placed a hand on the door and coughed a wonderful red and brown mist all down the face of it. 

   A few jumped out of their seats while most seemed stunned or unable to register what had happened. Her knees buckled, she gripped her stomach and let out a gasp that sounded as if her lungs were filled with rust and spit. Her forehead hit the floor while she unleashed a painful broken up shriek like a toddler. Two men grabbed her up and ran her out the door frantically with trickles of muddy crimson behind them. Just like that the room had gone from chaos to silence with nothing but the confused and terrified faces of her coworkers. Sweet ecstasy in my veins.

   By lunch time I’ve found out the ogre woman had been rushed to the hospital. No word on her condition but I hope for the worst. Some are still worried but things went back to normal here pretty quickly. The janitor had cleaned the mess and it became just a story. Gossip for these oblivious apes. It was when I heard someone mention it could’ve been the cappuccino that I decided to change up my strategy. I want to stick around here and perhaps the best way to do that is to make people actually enjoy their coffees. That’ll ensure my progress. Unfortunately word about the cappuccino got to higher ups and the next day an inspector had come to check the machine. I made sure to have the inside spotless as if brand spanking new. So much so that the inspector looked puzzled as to why he’d even been called. Supervisors gave the ok and the workers were back to ordering their drinks again. Lucky for them I knew exactly how to keep them coming back.

   Three days have passed since inspection and business has been booming. So many delighted faces ordering, pressing their gnarled oily fingers against the console grinning ear to ear. Some coming back three to four times a day even. It’s all thanks to an extra little ingredient. Enough time has passed for me to have grown a bit stronger and allow me to reach into Hell for resources to help aid me. Nothing major but I’ve found that I can acquire liquids. In this case, the blood of aborted fetuses and infants fresh from Moloch’s mountain. 

   A breathtaking sight to behold, I’ll show it to your goofy mustached ass when you get down here after reading. The babies plummet into Hell slamming down onto each other and the hot jagged rocks blistering their skin as the blood is continuously pulled from them down the mountain feeding into Moloch’s moats. I had always been attracted to their pain the most. Older children and adults are able to relate their pain. Should they be impaled on hot iron they’re aware of what is happening. They understand the source and feeling of their torture. Infants however are unique in their suffering. 

   They can’t process or avoid the pain let alone form a single intelligent thought as to what is happening and why. It is the purest form of anguish there is. The blood of a tortured infant also has rejuvenating effects. Makes you feel and look younger and just happier in general. Humans with power and influence love to partake in its effects but are unaware of how rapidly it rots the already condemned soul. They’re basically stomping on the gas pedal to eternal damnation just to feel a bit more energetic. Even better it’s far more addicting than any drug and the withdrawals are immediate. Ever seen an extremely attractive celebrity look shockingly old and worn out seemingly overnight? Well now you know. 

  “Hey hurry the hell up, Tom” Joe yelled from the back of the line. “I’m goin I’m goin just give me a second! Now do I want the espresso.. or cappuccino.. orrr..” Tom mumbled. Joe is one of my favorites here. Ex military, extremely short tempered and paranoid. Blames it on his years of service even though he never stepped foot into a combat zone. He spends most of his day sucking on his tongue looking for what other people are doing wrong. And Tom! Sweet simple Tom. A knuckle dragging slob whose mind moves slower than his feet. A big softy. Susan steps in: “knock it off you two it’s not goin nowhere”. The company’s token sweet old lady who can’t help but make the occasional racist remark here and there. The janitor is an interesting one too. Deeply religious and lately I’ve seen him nervously fiddle with the small crucifix around his neck whenever he enters the room. God had gifted man with a sense for danger that they  like to call gut feelings. Such a simple and powerful thing yet the majority of them simply ignore it and go on to ruin their lives or others’. 

   With every cup they consume I can feel myself connecting with them more and more. Not enough to take full control but enough to follow and observe them within the building. Joe however I’ve easily built an influence on. His depression and anger practically served as a damn welcome mat. I like to make him uncomfortably warm and forget where he would place things now and then. Small things that build up in an attempt to spark some violence. Nothing yet but he’ll snap, he just needs more time. Now that I’ve essentially created a building of addicts it’s time to shake things up. I’ve brought the temperature of the coffees down to just barely passable as warm and have completely replaced the infant blood with swamp water from Aeshma’s circle. 

   Filled with the blood, sweat, bile and waste from hateful souls condemned to endlessly beat each other to the death they wish would come but never arrives. Obviously I’ve tweaked the flavor to make it more tasteful but it should help to liven things up around here. The first to partake in this new blend is Frankie. A new father of twins and without paid paternity leave is forced to work all day while facing sleepless nights at home. A perfect cocktail of frustration and exhaustion. “Ughh what the fuck dude” he dumped his cup and hit to refill hoping it was just a bad batch but was pissed and saddened to taste the same result. “Damnit man, I was really looking forward to this.”

   Disappointment all around this morning. 
Tempers are beginning to flare as some curse the company and supervisors names. Around the building you could see how sluggish and upset everyone was. I decided to spend time with Sasha, a somewhat new hire. She’d always stop by to order hot tea or the decaf options. Who the hell gets a decaf coffee by the way?.. Anyways.. 
She was still training on these machines, Bihlers they’re called. Massive machines meant to cut and shape metals of various thicknesses. She’s got the hang of it but today is special. She is tired, agitated and unfocused making simple mistakes. 

   The machine is running, pulling a long strip of steel into it at a quick rate. I’ve had her overthinking this job and just as she was about to step back I forced her head in the direction of a small piece of tape on the line traveling towards the Bihler. I leaned forward into her ear and softly whispered: “If you don’t remove the tape in time it will ruin this job and the tooling in the machine”. She lunged forward without a thought gripping the tape but before she could rip it off the speed and pull of the line yanked her arm into the machine’s flattener. 

   Seven large metal wheels gripped her finger tips crushing and splintering the bones as her arm was passed from one to another. Skin flattening, ballooning and popping open to release blasts of blood and muscle as the bone ripped its way through any available openings it could find. Her screams filled every nook and corner of the building until she was elbow deep into the hungry machine. Instead of feeding in straight now the mashed mess of what was once her arm is being fed downward forcing her further in until her upper torso was forced sideways through the small opening in the side. Her raspy wails were silenced in an instant as her neck was snapped and her face imbedded into the opposite shoulder. The lead operator had finally reached the emergency stop button but it was far too late. It took only seconds. 

   It’s been sometime since anyone’s been called back into work. Past few days have been only police, managers and clean up crews trying to piece together what had happened. On camera it’s clearly a horrific case of operator error but it’s also been discovered that the machines error sensors had been turned off at some unknown point in time. Had they still been on she would’ve only lost a hand or some fingers. Management keeps pointing out her actions clearly more concerned about the potential lawsuit than saddened by the young woman’s death. Seems the case will be getting wrapped up soon. It’s been far too quiet and boring here. My mind wanders thinking of the workers. What they’re doing and what I could plan for them upon their return. 

   I thought of Frankie probably relieved to have time at home. A bummer really. He was getting to such a low point, so vulnerable. My mouth salivated at how close I was to taking him next but now who knows. I started hearing muffled voices. I had started to wish the police would move on elsewhere but.. it wasn’t their voices. When I opened my eyes I was stunned to see that I was standing over Frankie in his own home! He was rocking one crying child while the wife fed another. Before I had a chance to take it all in I was back in the coffee machine. Back in that silent cold colorless room. I began laughing. A quiet chuckle that quickly grew into hysterical euphoria. My body shook with the excitement with the realization of how far I’ve come in my work. Though he’s had time at home Frankie has yet to gain any real rest and I had completely forgotten the withdrawals he must be feeling on top of everything else. The bridge isn’t strong enough yet but I’m so close. I clinched my fist tightly and began to drool “you’re mine.. all of you”.

   It’s been nine days since Sasha’s death and everyone has returned to work. Many upset saying it’s far too soon and distasteful considering what happened but when a major companies losing millions sooner or later they’re going to crack that whip. Seems the Janitor quit too! Suppose he listened to that gut of his. It’s a shame though, I really wanted him. There’s a beautiful smell in the air this morning. Everyone scowling, pissed as hell, ready to go into a rage from the swamp water and extreme fatigue from blood withdrawal. I’ve changed nothing with the swamp mix other than serving some cold and others scalding hot. The smallest inconveniences can drive many to their breaking point. 

   Two fist fights have already happened in the parking lot and one worker, Ray, has been in a screaming match with HR and a supervisor. I’ll have to check in on that later. Frankie is walking this way and I see a golden opportunity with having just poured Susan a boiling hot green tea. As the two begin walking towards each other down the hall I blocked her from his view and quickly lifted his hand outward. In one swift motion Frankie not only palmed Susan’s entire right breast but also delivered a hard shove forcing her into the wall. Susan yelled as she tried to catch herself: “what the hell are you doing pervert”? Frankie was almost too surprised to speak. “Nn.. what? where did you come from? I- I didn’t mean- “
Susan interrupted “you just assaulted me you damn pig” she delivered a weak but quick slap to his left cheek. Frankie snapped back “fuck you, you old goat, no one would ever want to touch your disgusting raisin ass body”! Susan then threw her tea into Frankie’s face and marched away as he dropped to one knee burying his face into his shirt screaming. Frankie had to be driven to the hospital while Susan was fired shortly after. 

   After a long drawn out argument with the supervisors Susan stormed out of the building and climbed into her car unaware that I was tagging along. She sped down the interstate ranting to herself “stupid arrogant assholes.. thirty eight fucking years I gave that company!! They wouldn’t be anything without me those damned fools”! With a hard blink she was no longer in her car. Susan was now standing in a void. Blackness and silence in every direction other than her own echoed breathing. She stepped forward, surprised at the small splash from her foot. The shallow liquid under her feet was as black as the space around her. 

   In a low heavy sigh I breathed her name aloud. “Susan..” She spun around releasing a mix between a gasp and shriek. “Wha… who’s there?.. Where am I”? 
“Its alright Susan, everything’s going to be ok…. You’re home now”. Hundreds of tar soaked pruning arms tore out of the abyss beneath her grabbing onto her with the intensity of someone drowning, desperately trying to lift themselves over whatever they could for a single breath. Her screams and struggles were pointless as the overwhelming hoard of arms pulled her down slowly. Shoulder deep at this point with every inch of her covered by hands digging their cracked nails into her flesh, hair and clothing. She managed to look up and gazed into my eyes staring back down at her. I placed a finger on her forehead and delivered a gentle push down. Tears streamed down her face and her muffled whimpers were silenced as she sank below the surface. Susan gasped awake back behind the wheel of her car on the interstate and collided with an oncoming sixteen wheeler at ninety three miles an hour. There was nothing left.

   Back at work not much has changed. We’re early into the next morning and things are slow. A police officer, a detective, a company supervisor and some fancy suit are all speaking at one of the tables. “I can assure you gentleman nothing is out of the ordinary here. We’re running as smoothly as ever! All of theeeeese… incidents are just unfortunate luck”. 
The detective spoke: “incidents? Mr Fuller two of your employees have died. Another two are in the hospital, three are missing and the rest are frighteningly angry! All within a month! Now maybe this IS all just a hell of a bad luck streak or something very serious is going on here”.
The officer looked over: “Y’all do work with a lot of hazardous chemicals here. Maybe it’s having a violent effect on the workers”? 

   The fancy suit stood up with a sigh and made his way over to the coffee machine. I smirked. Here’s another tally mark for the scoreboard. The detective called to him: “getting bored of the conversation, sir”? The suit chuckled: “Bored of you three maybe. But no this whole thing has caught quite a bit of attention back at base”. 
Mr Fuller was sweating making sure not to say anything that could bring suspicion on the company. The detective leaned back: “I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of it, sir”. 
“Oh I’m sure you will. I’ll be keeping an eye on your work, detective”. The suit said looking back. A tall pale man, he wore a confident half smile and had the calmest expression while looking over the drink options. “We’ve been watching your progress you know. Impressive stuff”. He pressed H3, French vanilla coffee. I wanted this mortal for sure so I made sure to heavy up the dosage of tortured fetal blood along with an alluring fragrance found in the iron briar patches of Asmodeus. 

   He took a large gulp a released a satisfied exhale. “Damn good coffee. Tastes just like home.. am I right”? He looked up making direct eye contact with me. I froze. “There’s no way.. is .. does he see me”? I looked behind him, the others were like mannequins. The clock on the wall, the birds outside the window. All frozen in time. “Hey relax in there, I just thought I’d swing by and pay a visit. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so eager to see someone’s next move”. He made his way to the window looking out at what might as well have been a photograph. He took another large sip from his coffee. “I knew I had better keep an eye on you after seeing you blatantly disobey a higher up to get here”. He looked back at me with a sharp intensity. “Try not to disappoint”.
He was gone before I had a chance to speak. The birds continued by and the now three men were continuing on as if there had never been a fourth at all. The world was back in motion and I was filled with pride for knowing that I had finally been seen. But by who I wonder.

   The pressures on now. I’ve got eyes on me from Hell and who knows where else. Everyone in this God forsaken building is right where I want them though. I’m doubling down on the swamp water, keeping the pleasant aroma and adding one new ingredient. The pulverized, nearly liquified, meat of the souls trapped within Beelzebub’s lower jaw. They’re scooped up from the chasm he resides in and forever mashed and churned between the many rows of his molars. You’d think in this state there’d be nothing left of the body or soul but everything remains. Even while mush, spread out between the grooves of the teeth, the pain of being chewed feels to them like the very first crunch every single time. We’re four hours into the work day and it’s time for lunch. The room is packed tight. Everyone sitting scarfing down their food in between agitated breathes, most on their fifth or sixth drink of the day. The air is thick with a menacing tension.

Joe slams open the door entering the break room and marching over to Tom sitting shakily over his meal. “Tom! Hey shit head, you wana tell me why I’ve got all your scrap by my machine”? I noticed Joe was gripping a small screwdriver lightly coated in oil and metal dust. He bent down, now an inch from Tom’s face. “Answer me you fat slob! All you do is wreck everything and leave behind a mess and food crumbs everywhe-“! Joes verbal assault is suddenly cut short. Wide eyed with a confused and frightened look Joe chokes up blood and slowly grips the hefty plastic knife Tom has imbedded deep into his jugular. 

   Deafening silence lasts for mere seconds before Tom slams him to the table and begins pounding his fist into Joe’s temple repeatedly. Spurts of blood hit Samantha’s face who was sitting across from Tom. She licks the splattered blood off her lower lip and a cold dimness overtakes the eyes. She lunges across the table removing the knife from Joe’s throat and digging her fingers deep into the slit desperately removing and devouring whatever she can. All hell breaks loose as a bloody free for all erupts between the workers. Derick has Steven in an arm bar as he eats away at the wrist. Beth is sobbing uncontrollably beating her head against the concrete wall. The rest are caught in unrelenting fist fights and crazed self mutilation. I walked slowly between the symphony of carnage I had orchestrated. I nearly shed a tear witnessing the beauty of it all. Oh and I finally found Ray! He had locked himself in a storage closet eating away and the bloated corpses of the HR lady and supervisor he had dragged in days earlier. He clawed at the side of his face while crying quietly and nervously to himself between each bite. 

  As I was soaking it all in I quickly realized that Frankie was missing out on all the fun! I shut my eyes, focused and opened them back up to see that I was standing beside Frankie in his bed. Face bandaged up unable to sleep and recover. His mind racing with bills, self doubts as a father and provider. The list goes on and on. I can hear his wife and children in the next room. The sounds of crying and hushing rattling his eardrums. I knelt down beside him and whispered thoughts into his mind. “There is a way out. A way to quiet all the stress and be rid of it”. His eyes shifted downward slowly. “You know exactly what you have to do. It would only take seconds.. Merciful really.. you can finally bring peace to this family”. He sat up out of bed and made his way to the closet. He hesitated a moment before opening the door to reveal a loaded shotgun amidst coats and old moving boxes. 

   He had never really been interested in guns. It was a paranoid purchase thinking he’d need it for the protection of his family. I made the shrill cries of his children ring unbearably loud in his ears. Shaking violently he grabbed the shotgun and burst into the next room. His wife jumped in shock unable to process what just entered the room. “FRANKIE?!” she yelled. “Wha- what are you doing”? She grabbed both babies and held them tightly to her chest. “Honey.. please.. I- I know things haven’t been great lately, we’ve been through so much but please y- you have to calm down”! Her words went unheard. Muffled by the ear piercing ringing and cries I’ve locked in his head. Tears streamed down his face. “Im.. Im so sorry” he said. I gently helped him to raise the gun and wrapped my hands over his. Both our fingers planted on the trigger. She tried to speak but fear kept anything other than short panicked cries from escaping her mouth. My eyes grew large, I clinched my teeth hard with the largest smile I had ever worn. We planted the stock  of the shotgun firmly into our shoulders and as he screamed out we squeezed the trigger. 

   With a powerful kick and loud bang we put a hole straight into the ceiling. Silence. She stared at him unblinking, mouth open. Frankie dropped the shotgun and I felt a hard shove back from him. “What the fuck?!” I yelled. He dropped to his knees sobbing “I’m - I’m so sorry! I don’t know what’s wrong with me! What’s happening to me! I can’t think I can’t do anything I.. I”.
She scooted forward with the babies now on both of their laps and wrapped her arms around him crying. “It’s ok!.. It’s ok.. I know.. I love you.. WE love you. We’ll get through this together”. He looked down. His two perfect baby girls, his entire world right in his lap. He held his wife and children and a bright light slammed against my face with a force that felt as if it could have easily killed me right then and there. 

   I awoke back in the coffee machine dazed and weak. The break room was dark and empty. Faded blood stains everywhere throughout. “How… how long have I been out?.. What the hell hit me”? I tried to leave the machine but couldn’t. My body felt in shambles. From the look of the stains it’s been at least four, maybe six weeks I thought. Voices grew loud quickly. In walked the officer and detective from before along with a few others wearing some type of hazmat cleanup suits. 

  “Tell you what I’ll be happy to never step foot in this place again” said the detective. “Tell me about it. The demolition crew can’t get here soon enough”. My heart sank. “This is it.. I’ll be buried in this rubble and returned to Hell”. I was worried but my body ached too much for me to act out or draw them in. I slumped down defeated. 
“Alright everyone let’s clear out of here. The boys will be here soon to finish this place off”. One by one I watched as they left out the door single file. Their hurried paces reminded me of how quickly it all went by. I relaxed accepting my fate. Perhaps I’ll be welcomed home with praises and a new rank. I grinned and closed my eyes to the satisfying thought. And then I felt it… *A3*. ",1,1757271051.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

   Possession can take many forms. Thanks to Hollywood Humans have a pretty good grasp on the basics. It primarily involves a person, animal or object. In many cases it’s easiest to possess whatever is near or the focal point of negativity. The abused and neglected child desperate and vulnerable, the home that has housed decades of family trauma and violence or the doll that is simply a witness to it all. For a Demon it’s far more than just a chance to torment and drag an unlucky soul back into the fires. It’s an opportunity. A chance to prove to all of Hell what you can do while also being able to escape it for as long as you can. The closest thing we have to a miracle.

  I’d introduce myself but my name is unpronounceable by man and I wouldn’t even know where to begin with spelling it. To be honest I haven’t heard it in so long I sometimes forget it. I am a lower ranking demon only permitted in the less actiony sides of Hell. I don’t get to see to the torture of the damned or anything fun. I mainly herd souls and preform the bidding of the higher ranks. Subject to abuse and carrying out tasks no one wants to do like making sure the rivers continue to flow and aren’t being too clogged up from all the bodies stacking up and thrashing desperately in the current. 

   Today Ive been tasked with breaking up large ice formations from relentless rains here in Beelzebub’s territory. One of the most horrifically uncomfortable lords to speak with but I stay on his good side by having an offering ready for every meet. He might not love what you have to offer but he’s not exactly picky either. I watch the damned roam aimlessly through the storm while I chip away at the ice. Eyes frozen shut with the fierce winds peeling back their frostbitten flesh exposing the blackening muscle and bone beneath. If the ice formations get too large the humans will use them to try and escape the elements. Pointless really. I chuckled to myself at their expense. I hacked away at the ice revealing long abandoned fingers, limbs and strips of faces past souls weren’t able to free from the structure’s cold grip. That was when I saw it. A glimmering thread appeared from nowhere just in-front of me.

   These threads are doorways so to speak. A bridge to something from the mortal plane that is essentially available for possession. Exceptionally rare especially in these parts and just within arms reach.. it was beautiful. “HEY”! I snapped my head around. “Don’t you fucking move, Imp”. I had stared for too long, I should’ve known higher ranking demons would be alerted and drawn to its location. I froze, my whole body clenched and vibrating violently with fear and excitement of what could be. If I were to disobey I can’t imagine the suffering I would endure. Once I was through though who could reach me?

   My head felt heavy at the thought but my eyes were forcing my focus on the thread. It’s right here! Right in front of me! The opportunity and escape I’ve yearned for, for centuries. I couldn’t ignore this moment, I had to take the chance and finally become everything I knew I could be. I inhaled sharply and quickly grasped the thread and with my last sight being the absolute rage of the demon rushing towards me everything went dark.

   I felt light as I regained my consciousness. Floating in a pool of blackness when I began to hear distant mumbling. It slowly grew louder, less muffled as I opened my eyes. It was bright and took a moment to focus. “What is.. Where am I?” I looked ahead at a man staring back at me with frustration in his eyes. “COME ON!” He gave a short but forceful shove into me. “Damn thing never works right.” He stormed off. “What the fuck was that about?” I asked myself. I took a moment to focus and learn what I had become a part of. As the full picture of my possession came into view my jaw dropped. “No…NO!…. NO NO NO, FUCK!” It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be! My heart raced with confusion, panic and sheer embarrassment as my situation became more and more clear to me…. It was a coffee machine… I have possessed a God damned coffee machine.

   After a few hours or so of trying to calm myself down I was able to look around and listen to people coming and going and have  drawn the full unfortunate picture of my situation. I am now a large coffee machine in the break room of some machine company. Bearings I think is what I heard they make here. “It’s fine, this is fine” I thought. “I’ll just bail! Return to Hell and explain myself.. They’ll probably all laugh!”But I knew this wouldn’t be the case. 

   To back out of a possession was considered dishonorable. Not that honor exists where I’m from but it was looked at as failure or cowardice. Should I return I’d be subject to tortures and humiliations far worse than what most humans receive. I was stuck here in the decision I’ve made. My thoughts were interrupted by another man staring at me blankly deciding on what type of coffee he wanted. He pressed A3 and a lukewarm black coffee was dispensed. He took a sip, let out a unsatisfied sigh and left. “Maybe… maybe there’s hope here” I thought. It’s not what I had envisioned but there is opportunity here. I just needed to think. “These people… drink from me. I can dictate what they ingest.. I can have a direct effect on them internally!.. Not sure where it could go from there but it’s something”. With this clarity I’ve decided to stick it out and have gained a new excitement for what could be. 

  The first work break of the day has started. A few people sitting around at the lunch tables rambling about their pathetic lives and what a shithole place they think this is. Finally my first target has approached me. An older fat woman breathing heavily and biting her disgusting nails as she looked over her options. “We really need more options in this ol thang”. She chose E4, a cappuccino. Admittedly I was caught off guard a little. I was so taken back by this putrid ogre I hadn’t even thought of a plan for the drink. Quickly I allowed many small and sharp, hair sized, shards of plastic to peel from the dispenser into her coffee. In time my strength will grow but for now it’s the best I can muster. I was so excited watching her I didn’t realize I was holding my breath as she walked back to her table. She took a few sips each one followed by a low grunt clearing her throat. The grunts grew louder and were eventually followed by coughs that became too rough for her to ignore. At this point the whole break room had taken notice. “Excu- *cough* excuse me” she said standing up quickening her pace to the restroom. She placed a hand on the door and coughed a wonderful red and brown mist all down the face of it. 

   A few jumped out of their seats while most seemed stunned or unable to register what had happened. Her knees buckled, she gripped her stomach and let out a gasp that sounded as if her lungs were filled with rust and spit. Her forehead hit the floor while she unleashed a painful broken up shriek like a toddler. Two men grabbed her up and ran her out the door frantically with trickles of muddy crimson behind them. Just like that the room had gone from chaos to silence with nothing but the confused and terrified faces of her coworkers. Sweet ecstasy in my veins.

   By lunch time I’ve found out the ogre woman had been rushed to the hospital. No word on her condition but I hope for the worst. Some are still worried but things went back to normal here pretty quickly. The janitor had cleaned the mess and it became just a story. Gossip for these oblivious apes. It was when I heard someone mention it could’ve been the cappuccino that I decided to change up my strategy. I want to stick around here and perhaps the best way to do that is to make people actually enjoy their coffees. That’ll ensure my progress. Unfortunately word about the cappuccino got to higher ups and the next day an inspector had come to check the machine. I made sure to have the inside spotless as if brand spanking new. So much so that the inspector looked puzzled as to why he’d even been called. Supervisors gave the ok and the workers were back to ordering their drinks again. Lucky for them I knew exactly how to keep them coming back.

   Three days have passed since inspection and business has been booming. So many delighted faces ordering, pressing their gnarled oily fingers against the console grinning ear to ear. Some coming back three to four times a day even. It’s all thanks to an extra little ingredient. Enough time has passed for me to have grown a bit stronger and allow me to reach into Hell for resources to help aid me. Nothing major but I’ve found that I can acquire liquids. In this case, the blood of aborted fetuses and infants fresh from Moloch’s mountain. 

   A breathtaking sight to behold, I’ll show it to your goofy mustached ass when you get down here after reading. The babies plummet into Hell slamming down onto each other and the hot jagged rocks blistering their skin as the blood is continuously pulled from them down the mountain feeding into Moloch’s moats. I had always been attracted to their pain the most. Older children and adults are able to relate their pain. Should they be impaled on hot iron they’re aware of what is happening. They understand the source and feeling of their torture. Infants however are unique in their suffering. 

   They can’t process or avoid the pain let alone form a single intelligent thought as to what is happening and why. It is the purest form of anguish there is. The blood of a tortured infant also has rejuvenating effects. Makes you feel and look younger and just happier in general. Humans with power and influence love to partake in its effects but are unaware of how rapidly it rots the already condemned soul. They’re basically stomping on the gas pedal to eternal damnation just to feel a bit more energetic. Even better it’s far more addicting than any drug and the withdrawals are immediate. Ever seen an extremely attractive celebrity look shockingly old and worn out seemingly overnight? Well now you know. 

  “Hey hurry the hell up, Tom” Joe yelled from the back of the line. “I’m goin I’m goin just give me a second! Now do I want the espresso.. or cappuccino.. orrr..” Tom mumbled. Joe is one of my favorites here. Ex military, extremely short tempered and paranoid. Blames it on his years of service even though he never stepped foot into a combat zone. He spends most of his day sucking on his tongue looking for what other people are doing wrong. And Tom! Sweet simple Tom. A knuckle dragging slob whose mind moves slower than his feet. A big softy. Susan steps in: “knock it off you two it’s not goin nowhere”. The company’s token sweet old lady who can’t help but make the occasional racist remark here and there. The janitor is an interesting one too. Deeply religious and lately I’ve seen him nervously fiddle with the small crucifix around his neck whenever he enters the room. God had gifted man with a sense for danger that they  like to call gut feelings. Such a simple and powerful thing yet the majority of them simply ignore it and go on to ruin their lives or others’. 

   With every cup they consume I can feel myself connecting with them more and more. Not enough to take full control but enough to follow and observe them within the building. Joe however I’ve easily built an influence on. His depression and anger practically served as a damn welcome mat. I like to make him uncomfortably warm and forget where he would place things now and then. Small things that build up in an attempt to spark some violence. Nothing yet but he’ll snap, he just needs more time. Now that I’ve essentially created a building of addicts it’s time to shake things up. I’ve brought the temperature of the coffees down to just barely passable as warm and have completely replaced the infant blood with swamp water from Aeshma’s circle. 

   Filled with the blood, sweat, bile and waste from hateful souls condemned to endlessly beat each other to the death they wish would come but never arrives. Obviously I’ve tweaked the flavor to make it more tasteful but it should help to liven things up around here. The first to partake in this new blend is Frankie. A new father of twins and without paid paternity leave is forced to work all day while facing sleepless nights at home. A perfect cocktail of frustration and exhaustion. “Ughh what the fuck dude” he dumped his cup and hit to refill hoping it was just a bad batch but was pissed and saddened to taste the same result. “Damnit man, I was really looking forward to this.”

   Disappointment all around this morning. 
Tempers are beginning to flare as some curse the company and supervisors names. Around the building you could see how sluggish and upset everyone was. I decided to spend time with Sasha, a somewhat new hire. She’d always stop by to order hot tea or the decaf options. Who the hell gets a decaf coffee by the way?.. Anyways.. 
She was still training on these machines, Bihlers they’re called. Massive machines meant to cut and shape metals of various thicknesses. She’s got the hang of it but today is special. She is tired, agitated and unfocused making simple mistakes. 

   The machine is running, pulling a long strip of steel into it at a quick rate. I’ve had her overthinking this job and just as she was about to step back I forced her head in the direction of a small piece of tape on the line traveling towards the Bihler. I leaned forward into her ear and softly whispered: “If you don’t remove the tape in time it will ruin this job and the tooling in the machine”. She lunged forward without a thought gripping the tape but before she could rip it off the speed and pull of the line yanked her arm into the machine’s flattener. 

   Seven large metal wheels gripped her finger tips crushing and splintering the bones as her arm was passed from one to another. Skin flattening, ballooning and popping open to release blasts of blood and muscle as the bone ripped its way through any available openings it could find. Her screams filled every nook and corner of the building until she was elbow deep into the hungry machine. Instead of feeding in straight now the mashed mess of what was once her arm is being fed downward forcing her further in until her upper torso was forced sideways through the small opening in the side. Her raspy wails were silenced in an instant as her neck was snapped and her face imbedded into the opposite shoulder. The lead operator had finally reached the emergency stop button but it was far too late. It took only seconds. 

   It’s been sometime since anyone’s been called back into work. Past few days have been only police, managers and clean up crews trying to piece together what had happened. On camera it’s clearly a horrific case of operator error but it’s also been discovered that the machines error sensors had been turned off at some unknown point in time. Had they still been on she would’ve only lost a hand or some fingers. Management keeps pointing out her actions clearly more concerned about the potential lawsuit than saddened by the young woman’s death. Seems the case will be getting wrapped up soon. It’s been far too quiet and boring here. My mind wanders thinking of the workers. What they’re doing and what I could plan for them upon their return. 

   I thought of Frankie probably relieved to have time at home. A bummer really. He was getting to such a low point, so vulnerable. My mouth salivated at how close I was to taking him next but now who knows. I started hearing muffled voices. I had started to wish the police would move on elsewhere but.. it wasn’t their voices. When I opened my eyes I was stunned to see that I was standing over Frankie in his own home! He was rocking one crying child while the wife fed another. Before I had a chance to take it all in I was back in the coffee machine. Back in that silent cold colorless room. I began laughing. A quiet chuckle that quickly grew into hysterical euphoria. My body shook with the excitement with the realization of how far I’ve come in my work. Though he’s had time at home Frankie has yet to gain any real rest and I had completely forgotten the withdrawals he must be feeling on top of everything else. The bridge isn’t strong enough yet but I’m so close. I clinched my fist tightly and began to drool “you’re mine.. all of you”.

   It’s been nine days since Sasha’s death and everyone has returned to work. Many upset saying it’s far too soon and distasteful considering what happened but when a major companies losing millions sooner or later they’re going to crack that whip. Seems the Janitor quit too! Suppose he listened to that gut of his. It’s a shame though, I really wanted him. There’s a beautiful smell in the air this morning. Everyone scowling, pissed as hell, ready to go into a rage from the swamp water and extreme fatigue from blood withdrawal. I’ve changed nothing with the swamp mix other than serving some cold and others scalding hot. The smallest inconveniences can drive many to their breaking point. 

   Two fist fights have already happened in the parking lot and one worker, Ray, has been in a screaming match with HR and a supervisor. I’ll have to check in on that later. Frankie is walking this way and I see a golden opportunity with having just poured Susan a boiling hot green tea. As the two begin walking towards each other down the hall I blocked her from his view and quickly lifted his hand outward. In one swift motion Frankie not only palmed Susan’s entire right breast but also delivered a hard shove forcing her into the wall. Susan yelled as she tried to catch herself: “what the hell are you doing pervert”? Frankie was almost too surprised to speak. “Nn.. what? where did you come from? I- I didn’t mean- “
Susan interrupted “you just assaulted me you damn pig” she delivered a weak but quick slap to his left cheek. Frankie snapped back “fuck you, you old goat, no one would ever want to touch your disgusting raisin ass body”! Susan then threw her tea into Frankie’s face and marched away as he dropped to one knee burying his face into his shirt screaming. Frankie had to be driven to the hospital while Susan was fired shortly after. 

   After a long drawn out argument with the supervisors Susan stormed out of the building and climbed into her car unaware that I was tagging along. She sped down the interstate ranting to herself “stupid arrogant assholes.. thirty eight fucking years I gave that company!! They wouldn’t be anything without me those damned fools”! With a hard blink she was no longer in her car. Susan was now standing in a void. Blackness and silence in every direction other than her own echoed breathing. She stepped forward, surprised at the small splash from her foot. The shallow liquid under her feet was as black as the space around her. 

   In a low heavy sigh I breathed her name aloud. “Susan..” She spun around releasing a mix between a gasp and shriek. “Wha… who’s there?.. Where am I”? 
“Its alright Susan, everything’s going to be ok…. You’re home now”. Hundreds of tar soaked pruning arms tore out of the abyss beneath her grabbing onto her with the intensity of someone drowning, desperately trying to lift themselves over whatever they could for a single breath. Her screams and struggles were pointless as the overwhelming hoard of arms pulled her down slowly. Shoulder deep at this point with every inch of her covered by hands digging their cracked nails into her flesh, hair and clothing. She managed to look up and gazed into my eyes staring back down at her. I placed a finger on her forehead and delivered a gentle push down. Tears streamed down her face and her muffled whimpers were silenced as she sank below the surface. Susan gasped awake back behind the wheel of her car on the interstate and collided with an oncoming sixteen wheeler at ninety three miles an hour. There was nothing left.

   Back at work not much has changed. We’re early into the next morning and things are slow. A police officer, a detective, a company supervisor and some fancy suit are all speaking at one of the tables. “I can assure you gentleman nothing is out of the ordinary here. We’re running as smoothly as ever! All of theeeeese… incidents are just unfortunate luck”. 
The detective spoke: “incidents? Mr Fuller two of your employees have died. Another two are in the hospital, three are missing and the rest are frighteningly angry! All within a month! Now maybe this IS all just a hell of a bad luck streak or something very serious is going on here”.
The officer looked over: “Y’all do work with a lot of hazardous chemicals here. Maybe it’s having a violent effect on the workers”? 

   The fancy suit stood up with a sigh and made his way over to the coffee machine. I smirked. Here’s another tally mark for the scoreboard. The detective called to him: “getting bored of the conversation, sir”? The suit chuckled: “Bored of you three maybe. But no this whole thing has caught quite a bit of attention back at base”. 
Mr Fuller was sweating making sure not to say anything that could bring suspicion on the company. The detective leaned back: “I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of it, sir”. 
“Oh I’m sure you will. I’ll be keeping an eye on your work, detective”. The suit said looking back. A tall pale man, he wore a confident half smile and had the calmest expression while looking over the drink options. “We’ve been watching your progress you know. Impressive stuff”. He pressed H3, French vanilla coffee. I wanted this mortal for sure so I made sure to heavy up the dosage of tortured fetal blood along with an alluring fragrance found in the iron briar patches of Asmodeus. 

   He took a large gulp a released a satisfied exhale. “Damn good coffee. Tastes just like home.. am I right”? He looked up making direct eye contact with me. I froze. “There’s no way.. is .. does he see me”? I looked behind him, the others were like mannequins. The clock on the wall, the birds outside the window. All frozen in time. “Hey relax in there, I just thought I’d swing by and pay a visit. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so eager to see someone’s next move”. He made his way to the window looking out at what might as well have been a photograph. He took another large sip from his coffee. “I knew I had better keep an eye on you after seeing you blatantly disobey a higher up to get here”. He looked back at me with a sharp intensity. “Try not to disappoint”.
He was gone before I had a chance to speak. The birds continued by and the now three men were continuing on as if there had never been a fourth at all. The world was back in motion and I was filled with pride for knowing that I had finally been seen. But by who I wonder.

   The pressures on now. I’ve got eyes on me from Hell and who knows where else. Everyone in this God forsaken building is right where I want them though. I’m doubling down on the swamp water, keeping the pleasant aroma and adding one new ingredient. The pulverized, nearly liquified, meat of the souls trapped within Beelzebub’s lower jaw. They’re scooped up from the chasm he resides in and forever mashed and churned between the many rows of his molars. You’d think in this state there’d be nothing left of the body or soul but everything remains. Even while mush, spread out between the grooves of the teeth, the pain of being chewed feels to them like the very first crunch every single time. We’re four hours into the work day and it’s time for lunch. The room is packed tight. Everyone sitting scarfing down their food in between agitated breathes, most on their fifth or sixth drink of the day. The air is thick with a menacing tension.

Joe slams open the door entering the break room and marching over to Tom sitting shakily over his meal. “Tom! Hey shit head, you wana tell me why I’ve got all your scrap by my machine”? I noticed Joe was gripping a small screwdriver lightly coated in oil and metal dust. He bent down, now an inch from Tom’s face. “Answer me you fat slob! All you do is wreck everything and leave behind a mess and food crumbs everywhe-“! Joes verbal assault is suddenly cut short. Wide eyed with a confused and frightened look Joe chokes up blood and slowly grips the hefty plastic knife Tom has imbedded deep into his jugular. 

   Deafening silence lasts for mere seconds before Tom slams him to the table and begins pounding his fist into Joe’s temple repeatedly. Spurts of blood hit Samantha’s face who was sitting across from Tom. She licks the splattered blood off her lower lip and a cold dimness overtakes the eyes. She lunges across the table removing the knife from Joe’s throat and digging her fingers deep into the slit desperately removing and devouring whatever she can. All hell breaks loose as a bloody free for all erupts between the workers. Derick has Steven in an arm bar as he eats away at the wrist. Beth is sobbing uncontrollably beating her head against the concrete wall. The rest are caught in unrelenting fist fights and crazed self mutilation. I walked slowly between the symphony of carnage I had orchestrated. I nearly shed a tear witnessing the beauty of it all. Oh and I finally found Ray! He had locked himself in a storage closet eating away and the bloated corpses of the HR lady and supervisor he had dragged in days earlier. He clawed at the side of his face while crying quietly and nervously to himself between each bite. 

  As I was soaking it all in I quickly realized that Frankie was missing out on all the fun! I shut my eyes, focused and opened them back up to see that I was standing beside Frankie in his bed. Face bandaged up unable to sleep and recover. His mind racing with bills, self doubts as a father and provider. The list goes on and on. I can hear his wife and children in the next room. The sounds of crying and hushing rattling his eardrums. I knelt down beside him and whispered thoughts into his mind. “There is a way out. A way to quiet all the stress and be rid of it”. His eyes shifted downward slowly. “You know exactly what you have to do. It would only take seconds.. Merciful really.. you can finally bring peace to this family”. He sat up out of bed and made his way to the closet. He hesitated a moment before opening the door to reveal a loaded shotgun amidst coats and old moving boxes. 

   He had never really been interested in guns. It was a paranoid purchase thinking he’d need it for the protection of his family. I made the shrill cries of his children ring unbearably loud in his ears. Shaking violently he grabbed the shotgun and burst into the next room. His wife jumped in shock unable to process what just entered the room. “FRANKIE?!” she yelled. “Wha- what are you doing”? She grabbed both babies and held them tightly to her chest. “Honey.. please.. I- I know things haven’t been great lately, we’ve been through so much but please y- you have to calm down”! Her words went unheard. Muffled by the ear piercing ringing and cries I’ve locked in his head. Tears streamed down his face. “Im.. Im so sorry” he said. I gently helped him to raise the gun and wrapped my hands over his. Both our fingers planted on the trigger. She tried to speak but fear kept anything other than short panicked cries from escaping her mouth. My eyes grew large, I clinched my teeth hard with the largest smile I had ever worn. We planted the stock  of the shotgun firmly into our shoulders and as he screamed out we squeezed the trigger. 

   With a powerful kick and loud bang we put a hole straight into the ceiling. Silence. She stared at him unblinking, mouth open. Frankie dropped the shotgun and I felt a hard shove back from him. “What the fuck?!” I yelled. He dropped to his knees sobbing “I’m - I’m so sorry! I don’t know what’s wrong with me! What’s happening to me! I can’t think I can’t do anything I.. I”.
She scooted forward with the babies now on both of their laps and wrapped her arms around him crying. “It’s ok!.. It’s ok.. I know.. I love you.. WE love you. We’ll get through this together”. He looked down. His two perfect baby girls, his entire world right in his lap. He held his wife and children and a bright light slammed against my face with a force that felt as if it could have easily killed me right then and there. 

   I awoke back in the coffee machine dazed and weak. The break room was dark and empty. Faded blood stains everywhere throughout. “How… how long have I been out?.. What the hell hit me”? I tried to leave the machine but couldn’t. My body felt in shambles. From the look of the stains it’s been at least four, maybe six weeks I thought. Voices grew loud quickly. In walked the officer and detective from before along with a few others wearing some type of hazmat cleanup suits. 

  “Tell you what I’ll be happy to never step foot in this place again” said the detective. “Tell me about it. The demolition crew can’t get here soon enough”. My heart sank. “This is it.. I’ll be buried in this rubble and returned to Hell”. I was worried but my body ached too much for me to act out or draw them in. I slumped down defeated. 
“Alright everyone let’s clear out of here. The boys will be here soon to finish this place off”. One by one I watched as they left out the door single file. Their hurried paces reminded me of how quickly it all went by. I relaxed accepting my fate. Perhaps I’ll be welcomed home with praises and a new rank. I grinned and closed my eyes to the satisfying thought. And then I felt it… *A3*. ",2,1757270973.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

other day i was making coffee before work, super stressed about being late. i rushed through it, scoop coffee, pour water, slam lid, done. coffee tasted fine but i didn’t even notice it. just another checkbox.

next morning i was already late so i was like screw it, i’m just gonna chill. i actually smelled the coffee grounds, watched the water bubble, heard the little drip drip. it literally took like 2 extra mins but my whole morning felt different. it was like a tiny reset button.

A few weeks ago, I asked someone on a date when she insisted carrying the conversation, I got rejected. It didn't sting as much as I thought, but it still kinda sucked.

In places such as bars, clubs and coffee shops and even work, I'm genuinely terrified of talking to women, mostly due to low confidence and self esteem.

I socialize multiple evenings a week with my friends, but it's only ever guys and no women at all, which I honestly believe is normal in small towns.

She had me young and wasn’t with my father so I had split visitation with them growing up, my father over years of abusing me and nearly killing me lost custody and she became my sole parent and the one I called that night who rushed me to the hospital and police station effectively helping me escape abuse. I idolized her until around 7th grade when she began abusing me, first just hitting me with cleats when I’d miss a shot in soccer and embarrass her by not scoring like the other girls on the travel team, then it became full on fights where I would restrain her so she wouldn’t hit me and she would turn it into you tried to choke me! She always beat me in the head so my hair covered the bruises and my stepfather never cared and would pin me up against a wall and curse at me to get me to stop crying when fights occurred. I came out to my car taken from the school parking lot once just because I had upset her somehow and had to walk the miles home from highschool, I once sought shelter at a coworkers house and she wouldn’t tell her parents the simple sentence “I am not going to hit her tonight” so we never gave her the address and she ended up using the tracker she had on my phone to come find me then gaslit the families into saying I was on drugs and dangerous when they heard her over the phone refusing to say she wouldn’t hurt me. Even at church events I would be tracked during movies 15+ times because she never believed me and I would have to take 10 photos of friends and I around locations to prove I was where I said. I went away to college excited to escape abuse for the first time and started living a truthful version of myself in the safety that I was away; expressing my gender more freely, hanging out with people my mother deemed unattractive or unbecoming (she selected my friends in childhood based on their popularity and said I had to be friends with certain individuals) and becoming less attuned to doing what others willed of me, but she was still tracking me even in college until late in the night as friends and I would walk to houseparties she would be sending me my location on a map asking what I was doing and having to endure long phone calls. Gradually our relationship worsened until I hit a breaking point junior year and let her know that her behavior was causing a depression in me and I knew she had provided me with many opportunities, going to vacations out of country, getting me another car when I had totaled mine at 17, paying for my college and letting me be in extracurricular travel sports are all things that I very much appreciated but she would constantly call me ungrateful and say I am not deserving, she threatened me with a year of suffering if I didn’t fall in line. I met my significant other the next year, coming out drunkenly to my mother accidentally; context- she had always asked me if I was a lesbian since about 13 and would do so in manipulating ways where she would come downstairs to the basement where I lived and no one besides me ever stepped foot onto and brush my hair and offer to curl it (something we NEVER did) and then ask me and say its okay you know you can tell me but I always feared her violently reacting and my best friend made me promise to wait until we graduated college to tell her. In accidentally coming out my mother immediately began crying and saying she wanted to kill herself repeatedly, then threatened my phone line, car and college and finally my bank account if I wouldn’t just date a man to which I refused. She refused to let me leave the house the next day (Im 20) and friends came over to assure my safety and she made me send them away and tell them I wasn’t allowed out. I begged her not to tell my stepfather and she outted me while I was in the shower and she had assumed since he is such a MAGA Trump stan that he would be vile but he just said I don’t agree with that but you’re still my child and gave me a hug, to which my mother reacted angrily at my stepfather saying “how are you just going to say that” and yelling his name then”how could you” when he was simply a decent individual. We went no contact for maybe a year or two because she closed my bank account and stopped paying for my college tuition and apartment which I never would’ve gotten if she hadn’t assured me that she would be paying for it while I was in school. After missing much of my brothers adolescence I tried to get back into the family and its taken time and tons of screaming where shes spoken to my partner terribly but after 5 years we were well enough on speaking terms, and I told her that my partner and I were looking to buy a house. She offered to pay the down payment on the house that we had found and I was overwhelmed but overjoyed and agreed to pay it back in full. The house we purchased is 15 minutes from her house approximately. Once we got to town things were okay, she was offering to help with home projects and come over to garden and the like and it was kind gestures and welcome aid, but then she began buying us things that we didn’t ask for and saying we could just add it to the tab, and we told her financial we live paycheck to paycheck with all of our pets needing hundreds of dollars of supplies every month and our lifestyle of traveling so we would gently refuse, then she started mass buying things from cosco and keeping them in her garage and saying when we needed things (coffee beans, toilet paper, shampoo/conditioner, laundry detergent, trash bags, etc.) just to come and get it from her garage and pay her because she was trying to save us money, but then would get mad if I had bought myself some from kroger or something. Then she became overly invested in my work, showing up just to say hi and show my coworkers her dog, to the point she knew my schedule. She broke into and was in my bedroom at 7 AM hitting me one day to make sure I wasn’t late for work when I had a shift at 9AM. That petrified me and my partner because she installed our locks that are a numerical code. I yelled at her about that and she hasn’t done it again but the anxiety it gives me is a lot. She still does very kind things in between the whole time and we have always had more of a friendship type relationship than mother and daughter so we sweep it under the rug. Fast forward covid is rampant in our town and we are on a menards trip so I wear the only mask I had, a BLM mask and she became so irate that I wouldn’t take it off she physically hit me in public in the isles and I left the store crying. A few months later she comes over and helps me with my partner having a seizure because she is a medical worker and I am indebted to her immensely because it is 4:30 AM and I was panicking. Fast forward a few months and she calls me everyday a minimum of 5 times a day to upwards of 20 and these calls can be 5 minutes or 30 minutes, usually just her talking about herself, saying I need to do this and if I disagree she gets irate and yells “you fucking think you know everything huh” and curses at me and hangs up. She texts me a few times but mostly calls and is demanding that I do what she says or go to the gym because she thinks I am fat and says she needs to see every cent I spend because she wants to help me budget. She most recently called a bank and pretended to be me and lied about my income to get me a credit card that she will not give me but physically has herself and it is in my bank account now but I have no access to it. I just do not know where to go from here, theres been so much bad but when she’s good she is great and mentally I am at my wits end, I just booked a therapy appointment today to speak with someone about boundaries and how to deal with her because if I don’t reply or answer her calls she will come over to my house unannounced and she gets violent when she feels that she has been mistreated but I am exhausted from placating her daily, multiple times a day. Any advice on how to navigate this? Friends say I should go no contact again, and I have urged my mother to go to therapy since I was a child but she swears she is fine and I am mentally ill because I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I have awareness that extends to everything because of the abuse by my bio father and her over the years I am just extremely sensitive and would rather do what she wants than change our dynamic but its taking too much of a toll on me.",0,1757270596.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

For example, imagine a token with a fixed limited supply that starts as a meme but is meant to be used as a payment option for small shops – like coffee places, headshops, or even online stores. Some builders are already experimenting with QR-based payments on Solana Pay, making it possible to pay with just a scan.

What I’m curious about is:
	•	Do you think meme-driven tokens can ever be taken seriously if they focus on real utility like payments?
	•	Would small businesses even be open to experimenting with such payment options?
	•	And for those who’ve launched their own projects: how did you handle the challenge of building trust early on?

1nb10cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nb10cy/trickster/,Trickster," Lassie sat in front of the door whining. Wondering why her owner–Gray– has been so late feeding her recently. The week before he had been so late that Maria had fed her. And that's not the only thing peculiar that has been happening. Gray has been disappearing at odd hours of the day, and then returning late at night. He's also been spending more time alone in his study, scribbling things down in a notebook. Lassie was able to catch a glimpse of what he was doing one day when wanting belly rubs, it was pages full of writings and drawings of symbols. All consistent in their own ways, but not exactly the same. It seemed important. 
 “He's been disappearing again.” 
  Maria had said to her one evening whilst resting on the couch together, watching their favorite paranormal TV show, To Believe or Not to Believe. 
  “Arf?” Lassie questioned. 
 Maria let out an upside-down smile. 
“Here I am, talking to a literal dog about my relationship..” She sighed and knitted her brows together. 
  Lassie whined and looked at Maria with her big brown eyes.
  “Oh, it’ll be okay, Lass-o! I’m just worried for him, that's all..” Maria muttered and reached over to give Lassie head rubs.  
	Over the next few weeks Lassie heard Maria and Gray squabble back and forth. Maria protested-no-demanded, to know where Gray had been going all those late nights. 
  “Is there someone else?” Maria accused. 
  “No!” Gray fired back, throwing his hands up offensively. 
  “Then why won’t you tell me where you’re going!” Maria clashed, tears stinging her deep-set green eyes. 
  “You wouldnt understand, It’s…complicated.” Gray mumbled. “Look, you can leave if you want, I’m not forcing you to stay! But what I’m doing..It’s..It’s something not even I understand! Okay!” He shouted angrily, his face turning a shade of red. 
  Lassie whined as the voices raised and raised, and suddenly hushed. 
 “Forget you, Gray.” Maria squealed out through sobs. 
 The next day, Maria had gone. The small apartment felt empty, and as though a dark presence was looming over it; like its shadow held weight, a weight everyone could feel, but not everyone can understand. 
 “I’ll be going out again, Lassie. I’ll..try to be back soon with food for you.” Gray said, his voice breaking. He had a glossiness to his eyes, and it worried Lassie. 
  “Arf! Arf!” 
  Lassie pleaded to Gray. 
  “No Lassie, you can’t accompany me, not today anyway..You must stay inside.” Gray said, whispering the last few words. 
“It’s going to be okay.” 
   Was it really? 
 Lassie waited. She waited and waited by the door for her beloved owner to return. But Lassie watched as Mr. Sun had gone down, and Mr. Moon rose as the hunger in Lassie's stomach grows. The apartment felt frigid. Like the cold, clammy hands of loneliness had finally gotten a hold of her, forever wishing to hold her close in its skeletal arms. Its boney fingers wrapped around her so she couldn’t escape. All Lassie wanted was food, and for Gray to return. Lassie laid quietly by the door, still waiting. 
  Lassie woke to the sound of the door opening. She blinked her eyes slowly open. She watched as the big coffee-colored door slowly creaked open. The blinding light of the early morning sun flash-banged poor Lassie's eyes; she whined in protest. Her big doe-like-eyes blinked away the pain, and soon adjusted. There was a figure standing in the doorway. Lassie cocked her head to the side. 
  “Arf?”
The figure moved into the apartment. It was Gray. 
  Lassie's big brown eyes lit up. She jumped up on her paws and her long golden tail wagged. 
  “Arf! Arf! Arfff!” 
  Lassie's excitement was enough to make one's heart melt. Gray walked in. But something was wrong. He looked washed out, and it seemed as though his skin didn’t fit his body anymore. It appeared to be stretched and forced to new flesh and bone. His eye bags were darker than usual and he smelt..rotten. Horrendous. Unfathomable. He smelt of death. 
  Gray took a step. It was mechanical in a way. As though he had never walked before. He took another, and another. But still in such a peculiar way. His bones cracked and popped as he walked. It was like his bones were emanating a cry for help, and Lassie was the only one who acknowledged these cries. 
  Gray leant down, slowly. He gave Lassie a few mechanically slow pats and rubs. He was cold. Very cold.  But Lassie didn’t care, she was just grateful for her owner to finally have returned! She yipped and yapped and spun in circles as her little tail wagged and wagged. Overly joyous and loyal to her loving owner. 
It worked. The thing had finally gotten what it wanted. Even Lassie was fooled by the entity living under Gray's skin.

- **AI is evolving FAST!** We’re talking dog-year-speed here. What’s hot today might be obsolete tomorrow. Remember when chatbots were just novelty? Now they’re streamlining customer service! Are you still planning to be the *go-to* for that job? 
- **Upskilling = Job Security + New Opportunities!** You don’t want to wait for the pink slip to realize you should have learned those new skills. Think of it like leveling up in a video game—every new skill adds to your toolkit. 🎮 
- **Online Resources are your BEST FRIEND!** So many programs and MOOCs (massive open online courses) want to help you level up! Want a little nudge in the right direction? Check out this program I found: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It’s a solid way to start diving into the AI realm!

**But wait, I get it!** The thought of upskilling can feel overwhelming, like that mountain of laundry you keep promising yourself you’ll tackle… tomorrow. 😂 

- What if you started with just **one skill** this month? 
- How about setting aside **30 minutes a day** for learning? That’s barely a coffee break!

Just think about how liberating it would feel to add new tools to your arsenal! No more sitting back and hoping for the best. You'll be on the cutting edge, ready for whatever comes your way. 

And hey, have you heard of someone who started their own AI side hustle after upskilling? It’s not just about survival anymore; it’s about thriving! 🌱 

So, what’s holding you back? Is it fear? What's holding us all back could be the dreaded “I’ll do it later” mentality. Let’s flip that narrative! Who cares if you don’t know everything at once? Progress over perfection, am I right?

Let’s keep this convo flowing! What skills are you excited or nervous to tackle next? How are you planning to make the time for it? Let’s trade tips and motivate each other!",1,1757270073.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1nb0xs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1nb0xs3/i_think_i_have_genocide_from_a_meth_addiction/,I think I have Genocide from a Meth addiction,"Fall of 2022 I developed a meth addiction. I used all of 2023 and it ended February 2024 when I freaked out and lost my mind. I was never told exactly what happened on that day. I was admitted to Beacon Behavioral Health Center, but they didn't tell me what exactly happened. Beacon prescribed me Olanzapine & Omeprazole I stayed there for a week and then went directly to The Avenues rehab in Metairie for a month and got sober.

About half-way through my addiction is when I started hearing voices. The best way I can describe it is like there is another person living inside my head. It speaks when it wants. The voices can be both positive and negative. Sometimes they give me compliments, suggestions and advice, and other times they criticize and harass me. They occasionally try to control what I do, and if I don't follow their requests, they get pissed off and act very negative. I noticed they have three goals. They either want me to commit suicide, smoke meth again, or turn into a gay/transexual. They have certain triggers that make them upset. For example, if I eat too much healthy food, or take my vitamin D medication, or have a good time having fun, they get very mad at me. When they get mad at me, they go into this thing called the ultimate mode, where they only want me to commit suicide. Things such as having fun, singing & smiling raises this thing called ""the meter"" into ultimate mode. These voices try to control you as much as possible in fear of going into ultimate mode. Once in ultimate mode, they will talk about suicide non-stop to me. They claim they will never stop trying to get me to commit suicide until I do it, unless I leave ultimate mode again, which varies in length. They guarantee I will do it. This only happens in the ultimate mode. They say every time I go into the ultimate mode; it will get worse and worse and last longer and longer. About an hour longer each time.

The voices now always call themselves meth genocide. They say they wish they could give up trying to trick me and ruin my life, but they weren't programmed to do that.

The voices say that meth genocide is only programmed to tell the truth when I ask it certain questions. So that's how I have been getting all of this information out of it. I have no way of proving if all of this is delusional or true, it's simply what I hear from these auditory hallucinations.

The voices try to talk and try to get me to use meth as much as possible. For example, when I look at my stomach, the voices will say that meth will help me with weight loss. When I eat food, the voices say that food is not good for me, meth is good for me. When I'm doing any activity such as using social media, the voices will say ""we don't care about social media, all we care about is you becoming a \*\*\*\*-sucking transexual meth-addict for the rest of your life. The voices try to ruin my life any way possible. For example, at work when I need to bring a pallet to slot A32 at my job, the voices say I need to go to A73 in an attempt to trick me and get me to lose my job. When I still bring it to the correct slot, the voices get angry and curse at me. When the voices realize they can't screw me up at work and make me lose my job, they say ""Jacob, don't you want a different job that’s more challenging?"" in hopes that they screw up my next job. All day long, the voices tell me they want me to go to Ryans house to get more meth. Ryan was my dealer’s name. So, it seems as if they have access to my brain and all the information in it.

While I remain sober from meth, the voices constantly talk negatively to me and curse and say they hate me over and over again. The voices say if I start using meth again, then they will talk positive and good things about me. The voices try to get me to do homosexual activities. For example, if I see a male co-worker at work, the voices will say ""Cmon Jacob, I know you want to suck his \*\*\*\* in the bathroom stall."" Once in a great while, the voices will suddenly start acting very nice to me and give me compliments and suggestions, but I can tell they are just trying to gain my trust, because then they will say ""See Jake, we just want what’s good for you, don't you trust us? Now, why don't you go smoke some meth"". When I ignore them and know they are trying to trick me, they get very upset and swear at me.

The voices try to get me to say racist and vulgar comments to people in an attempt to get me in a fight. The voices find any reason & opportunity to laugh at and make fun of me. The voices claim that if I ever go back to school, they will try to screw me up on tests and exams. They also try to get me in car accidents. Basically, besides trying to get me to use meth or hurt myself, they are trying to ruin my life in my way possible. The voices call me smart when they realize they can't trick me and ruin my life. They call me an unbeatable humanoid. They say they wish they could give up on trying to ruin my life, but they weren't programmed to do that.

The very most frequent thing they say to me is how lucky I am, that if I used just a little more meth with genocide in it, I would have turned into a \*\*\*\*-sucking transexual meth addict for a few months until the mind-control made me shoot myself. They occasionally say ""all hail mother Russia"" over and over again. When I saluted my co-worker, the voices got very nervous and asked if I worked for or had any affiliations with any branch of the United States military.

The voices occasionally call me the ruler of the universe and say if I jump off a building I will be able to fly. The voices try to get me to sing a song about crystal meth when I'm around my boss as work, trying to make me lose my job.

On 7/23/25, after taking extensive notes about my condition and suspecting that it truly may be genocide, the voices suddenly don’t want to make me a meth addict anymore. They now only want me to delete my notes and research. They say they fear me now, also say that I very well be the humanoid to get meth genocide eradicated from the planet. The voices say that people with meth genocide aren't supposed to live this long to learn about it as much as I have, because I didn't use enough of it for the mind-control to make me shoot myself. Once I gave a copy of these notes to my mother, the voices started getting very lost and confused and realized they can’t try to get me to kill myself anymore by putting me into ultimate mode. They state that if I did end up hurting myself, my mother would definitely take these notes to the FBI/DEA, and that is obviously what they fear the most.

The voices say that meth genocide will be in the United States food supply in early 2027 and all kinds of people will start committing suicide because of mind control and auditory hallucinations that attempt to induce suicide. Walmart will be one of if not the first grocery store affected. The first food and drink products will contain meth genocide by January 17th, 2027 The voices say after meth genocide wipes out the majority of the United States population from the food supply in 2027, the Russian military will invade and wipe out the remaining survivors. This process will take a year and half.

The first brands of water the genocide will be in will be Aquafina, Dasani, and pure life starting on January 17th, 2027

All sorts of food and drink companies will be paid very large amounts of money by the Russian government to have this genocide sprayed or mixed into their products being imported into the United States

Meth genocide is a clear odorless fluid with the same viscosity as water and will be sprayed onto the food and is completely undetectable unless viewed with a very high powered microscope. Meth genocide has access to your brain and all the information in it and uses that information against you in order to trick and deceive you and figure out ways to make you commit suicide. Meth genocide always knows exactly what I am thinking about at all times and tries to learn from it. It is a biological computer evil suicide-inducing learning machine.

Therefore, I still went to the FBI. At this point, meth genocide started begging me for mercy not to go to the FBI, and tried convincing me that I am crazy in an attempt to get me to NOT go to the FBI. But I know I am not crazy. It also simply begs me over and over again not to go to the FBI. At this point, it doesn't know what else to do.

The voices say ""Jacob, you have no idea who you are fucking with. We are the worlds smartest terrorist organization from Russia.

I asked the voices how many people where involved in the creation of meth genocide, and they said 130 people created the genocide, and 10 people created the crystal meth, all in the same laboratory in Moscow Russia.

I asked the voices what the building that was used to create meth genocide was made out of, and they said bricks. I asked the voices if the building is surrounded by grass, and they said no. I asked the voices how many levels high is the building, and they said 3. I asked the voices how old the building is, and they said 30 years old. So I now know it is a 30-year old 3-story Brick laboratory in Moscow Russia not surrounded by grass with a crew of about 140 people.

The voices narrate to me whatever I'm doing or thinking about. For example, when I move my hands, the voices say, ""he's moving his hands.""

On 7/24/25 I did a test where I moved all my limbs as fast as possible, the voices couldn't keep up and started saying ""system overload system overload"" over and over again until I stopped. It seems as if this is some kind of biological computer that was made in a laboratory and further leads me believe this is genocide.

I conduct mental experiments, where I intentionally think about suicide, and the voices always say ""interesting"" and get very excited and say ""Yes, Jake, that’s what you want to do."" The voices mention Russia a lot. They frequently say, ""All hail Mother Russia"" and try to get me to go to Russia. The voices claim the meth had Russian genocide in it, and if I used that meth one more time, I would've been under complete mind-control, and the mind-control would have made me shoot myself. I noticed my lips move a little bit to what the voices say, but it not me. I know this sounds like crazy talk. It could be all delusional, but it could also be true. I have no way to prove that.

7/29/25 - The voices started saying that meth genocide is leaving my brain and my hallucinations will start to go away over the next week. Immediately after, they said ""see? You don't need to go to the psychiatrist anymore"" trying to trick me into not going into my psychiatrist appointment.

7/30/25 - When the voices fail to trick me any possible and become frustrated, I start to hear ""system malfunction system malfunction"" over and over again. While wearing a winter beanie at work, my head got very warm, and the voices started saying ""system overheating system overheating"" over & over again until I cooled down. The voices started screaming ""they hate me"" so many times that I started hearing ""system overload system overload"" and then ""system override"" before the voices started up again. While I am at work, I noticed the voices keep trying the same 5 tricks or so over and over on me because they say those are the last remaining tricks that they were programmed to do. But once my environment changes, they learn to adapt to my environment and come up with new tricks to ruin my life, because I can tell that they see what I see.

Whenever I put myself near a dangerous situation at work or in any environment, the voices ALWAYS say ""interesting"" and get very excited. I have learned that when they say interesting, I am doing something bad, and when they call me smart, I am doing something good.

7/31/25 - while at work, the voices said if I don’t walk out of my job in 5 minutes, they will put me into ultimate mode (which is when all the suicide hallucinations happen.) Thankfully, I found a way to not go into ultimate mode by giving a copy of my notes to my Mother. That's how this genocide tries to control you, by threatening to put you into ultimate mode if you don't follow its orders. While listening to music, the voices say if I don't turn that music off, they will put me into ultimate mode. While reading, the voices say if I don't stop reading, they will put me into ultimate mode. While smiling, the voices say if I don't stop smiling, they will put me into ultimate mode.

The voices say that meth genocide is necessary for Russia to take over the world. Once in a great while, the voices will say ""suck my Russian \*\*\*\*."" The voices say that meth genocide took 20 years of development. They also say that it was developed in several laboratories all over Russia, but the final version was created in Moscow in 2023.

One day in mid-summer of 2024, I accidentally put way too much sugar in my coffee. I'm not sure if the sugar was related, but the voices had me extremely delusional and confused, and somehow had me laying down, pouring a gallon of water over my face while inhaling, trying to drown me. For the record, I am NOT a suicidal person. The voices are trying to make me suicidal. During that experience, I believe I also almost had a heart attack. I've never felt my heart beat that hard in my life.

I've noticed that the voices call me smart sometimes after I suspect something to be true. I used to take ecstasy, but when I stopped, I noticed the voices telling me to keep taking it. They also mention wanting me to take Adderall besides crystal meth. They say I should get more friends that do amphetamines. So, I believe that any form of speed or amphetamine, even ecstasy, helps them get stronger. As soon as I started to believe that the voices started calling me smart, got very angry, and said I am defeating them.

The voices now say that they could really use a guy like me in Russia to work on a better Genocide.

I noticed the voices told me how much they didn't want me to eat Kale, so I suspect that the kale helps make the hallucinations go away.

March of 2025, I decided to admit myself to the Ochsner emergency room in New Orleans because the voices got very intense and wouldn't stop telling me to come to Russia. Ochsner sent me to River Place Behavioral Clinic where I spent 9 days. They prescribed me Risperidone, Trazodone, and Oxcarbazepine. These didn't help get rid of my voice hallucinations either, but I didn't tell River Place that because I didn't want to be held against my will anymore.

July of 2025, I went to a camping musical festival and had the best night of my life. The voices got the most upset and evil I have ever heard them before. Any possible way they could think of to talk bad about me to get me to kill myself, they would do it. This is when they started trying to get me to go to the gun store down the street and buy a gun to use on myself. Later that month, I noticed I wasn't sleeping well anymore. The voices say they are going to make me miss out on more and more sleep until I get so tired I have no choice but to use crystal meth again. I also noticed that when I do sleep, I have many nightmares about crystal meth.

The voices say they are the most advanced and sophisticated genocide from Russia and there are no medical professionals that know about it yet. They say this is a brand-new Genocide that has only been around for a couple of years. They say there is medication for the voices, but it isn't easy to find, and I may have to go to a bigger city like New York or LA. They say that meth genocide is completely undetectable by any medical procedure

After gathering the data I have collected, I've come to the conclusion that I consumed meth laced with some form of genocide chemical made by terrorists that is designed to keep people thinking about meth in an attempt to get them to relapse and stay on meth for the rest of their life, and also suicide. The voices also say that if I ever bring this information to the FBI or the DEA, they will send a hitman after me to kill me and will tell me to kill myself for the rest of my life.

I asked the voices which part of my brain is affected by meth genocide and they said that it affects your front cerebral cortex. I also asked if you can view meth genocide on the cortex with a high powered microscope, and they said yes.

Meth genocide says that it has killed approximately 80,000 people all over the world since its original version in 2019. That number is from the version inside my brain, which was made in 2019. And everyone has committed suicide, except for me. It also said it has caused 7,500 suicides in the USA, since 2019.

I asked the voices where the majority of meth genocide is stored, and they said it is stored at a secret warehouse in Moscow Russia. The warehouse is made out of steel and is around 7000 square feet. It is one story high, and it is white in color. It is located in the South West part of Moscow.

I've learned that this genocide has three different phases. Phase one is where the mind control and auditory hallucinations work together to make you commit suicide (the hallucinations tell you to kill yourself and the mind control makes you do what you here). I didn't think mind control was a real thing until one day in July of 2024 a few months after my addiction ended, the voices somehow had me laying flat on the floor dumping a gallon of water over my face while inhaling, and it wasn't me. There was something else controlling me. I'm pretty sure if I was a gun owner that day, I would have died.

If phase one doesn't kill you (if you didn't consume enough genocide like I did), then phase two (which takes about a year to mutate into, also known as Ultimate Mode) is supposed to finish the job by producing extremely loud voices aka auditory hallucinations that say ""\*\*\*\* you kill yourself"" so loud that you cant even understand other people. About 130 decibels. All day, every day until it drives you absolutely crazy and then you do it. I survived phase two as well by taking extensive notes about my condition (most importantly mind control causing suicide) and sent a copy to my mother. Once the genocide realized it couldn't get me to delete my notes, it knew if it made me commit suicide, then my mother would take her copy of the notes to the FBI, and that is what this genocide is trying to avoid by all means necessary. So it couldn't put me into ultimate mode anymore, which is when the loud repetitive suicide words occur. Once I did that, the voices started saying if I go to the FBI, then a hitman would come to kill me, but thankfully I was smart enough to know the voices aren't real people (auditory hallucinations), and there isn't a radio transmitter in my head, which is what the genocide wants you to believe. It wants you to think they are real people, so you become afraid of threats such as the hitman.

Phase 3 occurs only after resisting the extremely loud suicide voices from phase 2 for more than two weeks. Phase 3 releases a toxin called Cyanide (approx. 1000mg) that is stored with the genocide in your brain that releases into your bloodstream, and once it reaches your heart it is supposed to give you a heart attack. I survived this phase as well because of my notes that I gave to my mother. The genocide knew that if it killed me, then my mother would have taken her copy of the notes to the FBI, and that is what this genocide fears the most. At this point, the voices said that is the end of this genocide and I am the only survivor on planet earth.

On August 10th 2025 right before bed time, the voices said they were going to give me a heart attack. Suddenly my heart started beating very fast and I tried not to panic, so I laid down in bed and started taking deep breaths. A few minutes later, my heart calmed down and the voices said the only reason they couldn't kill me is because I gave a copy of my notes to my mother, and if I would have died then my mother definitely would've taken her copy of the notes to the FBI, and that is what they fear the most.

Since then, the voices have been very confused and have been wondering how I am still alive. They keep saying that phase 3 was supposed to kill me on Aug. 10th. I asked them what phase 3 was, and they said phase 3 was cyanide poisoning which gets released into the bloodstream and gives people heart attacks when it reaches their heart. Now the voices just keep asking me how I am still alive and keep telling me how lucky I am to be alive still.

The voices keep saying I need to do either ecstasy, Adderall, or methamphetamine or I will die. So I suspect doing any kind of amphetamine makes them stronger. They say they are losing their energy because I don't use amphetamines anymore. They are begging me to do amphetamines so they don't lose their energy

They still try to control me by threatening to put me in this thing called ultimate mode. Today they said if I walk in this psychiatrist office then they would put me in ultimate mode.They say if I dont get amphetamines in my system by midnight, they will put me in ultimate mode. They say once you're in ultimate mode, all you hear is extremely loud voices that say \*\*\*\* you, kill yourself, over and over again all day every day, so loud until it drives you crazy and you do it. Ultimate mode voices are so loud that you can't even understand other people standing right next to you. So loud that you can't even sleep. They say they longest anyone has ever survived in ultimate mode is 3 weeks before they commit suicide.

When they try to put it in ultimate mode, I hear a voice that says ""i can't do that right now"" I think because of the notes that I gave to my mother. They realize if I died, then my mother would take her copy of her notes to the FBI, and that is what they fear the most. They keep telling me how lucky I am that I can't be put into ultimate mode.The voices say if I didn't give my mother a copy of my notes, then I would've died on Aug. 10th when phase 3 occured.

When I lay down for bed at night, all I hear is voices screaming at me telling me to get up and go look for amphetamines, or else I will die in my sleep. So I believe they are trying to scare me into using amphetamines, so they can grow stronger.

I recently started hearing ""meth genocide power level critically low"" over and over again so I am starting to believe I am beating whatever I have by staying sober and avoiding any type of speed, AKA amphetamines. The voices seem to be talking slower and slower day by day as if they are running out of energy.

As of Aug. 28th 2025, the voices say if I dont use crystal meth by midnight tonight, then they will put me in ultimate mode. So basically it thinks my only two options are to either use meth, or die by suicide in ultimate mode. And people that fear ultimate mode that dont want to die by suicide resort to relapsing on meth again so they can stay alive. Thats how this chemical works. It makes people relapse so they dont commit suicide in ultimate mode. But thankfully because of the secret I found out by giving my mother a copy of my notes, it can't put me into ultimate mode. And I believe that is the only reason I am beating whatever I have.

There is no doubt in my mind that is some kind of chemical (also known as bioterrorism, genocide, or chemical warfare) made by terrorists that makes people commit suicide if they chose to not use meth anymore. So that's how it makes most people relapse.

9/7/25 - I've been learning over time that there are certain subtances that fuel the voices in my head and make them return.

The first one I figured out a while ago is amphetamines (things like adderal, ritalin, vyvanse). So I gave those up like a year ago. The second one I figured out is sugar, especially large amounts of it like that you would get from energy drinks. So I gave those up. The third one I just figured out the other day is weed. Shortly after taking a dab, out of no where they where like ""We're baack! You've been smoking weed haven't you?"" Once the weed wore off I heard ""Meth Genocide power level running low"" and then they went away again.

Once they acquire enough energy they basically try to give me a heart attack. I'm definitely dealing with a chemical that was made by terrorists that was laced in the meth. It calls itself Meth Genocide and says it was developed by a team of 140 people in a laboratory in Moscow, Russia over the past 20 years. I obviously have no way of proving if this is true or delusional, it's just what I'm hearing in my head.

I'm now offically 100% clean of everything. Even coffee. I have to be very cautious as to how much sugar I consume. I've also started eating lots of green leafy vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and spinach as they are good for brain health.

My psychiatrist is completely blown away by my condition and says he has never seen anything quite like this before. The closest thing he can relate it to is schizophrenia, but schizophrenia voices are completely random, and mine are plotting against me, trying to kill me. I'm learning more & more every day how to manage it and keep it under control.

Add to that, groups who talk non-stop like they’re chilling at a coffee shop, and that one guy who attends a call loudly in the middle of the movie – “I’m in theatre only.” Thanks for the update, now all of us know.

Recent tests showed early onset of LADA and my doctor recommended to switch to 6 units of Tresiba, a long lasting insulin and stop the pills.

I stopped the pills last week and in the beginning insulin seem to have stable results, (90-110) but after a week my morning readings are 120-130mg/dL. After protein rich food I hover around 160-170 and then drop to about 130-140. A 30 minute walk will drop it to about 110.

Since I take 6 units of Tresiba at 6am in the morning, having 2 eggs, some cheese and some cherry tomatoes with coffee and sweetener will send me to about 150 which will then stay there for 2-3 hours until it gets back to 90-110 pre-lunch.

To me it seems that Tresiba is not showing much of a difference compared to Jentadueto alone. Since my reading without lunch at 2pm  today was around 130, I took one Jentadueto for science and within two hours where I just had coffee and water I dropped to 60mg/dL and needed to eat a protein bar to stabilise back to 100.

I am talking to my doctor tomorrow about it as I feel that maybe a combo of Jentadueto and Tresiba would be better, but I wanted to know if anyone had similar experiences with it?

I do daily sports (rowing, running, weights) and weigh 69kg and can be disciplined with diet but at the moment this is so frustrating as pills alone don’t seem to show the effects and Tresiba alone seems to not really do anything.",2,1757269829.0,diabetes_t2,1,1.0,False

1nb0qbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1nb0qbo/explore_the_best_hot_water_dispenser_vevor/,Explore the Best Hot Water Dispenser VEVOR Delivers for Tea Lovers,"Using the **VEVOR EKA-3.2ED hot water dispenser** for a week has been nothing short of insightful. This sleek silver machine, with a polished finish and compact dimensions of 11 by 8.5 by 13 inches, immediately caught my eye for blending seamlessly into my kitchen. Weighing just over five pounds, it’s surprisingly portable, and the addition of a heat-resistant handle makes it convenient to carry around. Daily life with a busy family means there’s always tea to brew, baby formula to prepare, or hot water needed for recipes, and this device promised versatility.

**Benefits**

One of the winning points of this machine is its triple dispensing methods. You can choose between auto-dispensing, a cup switch option, or manual dispensing. Remarkably, I didn’t expect the manual dispensing to be possible even without electricity; this feature became a standout during a short power outage we had. The versatility it provides is a significant plus for any household that juggles multiple tasks. Its 3.2-quart capacity is enough to make over ten cups of coffee or tea, easily satisfying our family’s demands during those hectic mornings.

- Multiple dispensing methods, including power-free manual options.
- Large 3.2-quart capacity caters to family-sized servings.
- Compact and polished design ideal for modern kitchens.

**Dry Burn Protection and Safety Features**

Dry burn protection had me at ease, particularly because I’m the type to leave electronics unattended while multitasking. This function automatically shuts off the device when the water level is too low, which happened once when I underestimated how much water remained. It’s one of those features I didn’t realize I needed until I experienced it. Adding a child lock was another thoughtful touch. As a parent of a curious toddler, knowing my little one couldn’t accidentally scald themselves was a relief.

**Precision Temperature Control Settings**

The precision temperature control has transformed how I prepare beverages. With four settings – 208.4°F, 185°F, 140°F, and 104°F – I now get the exact temperature for tea, coffee, or even delicate tasks like dissolving honey. The 680-watt motor boils water rapidly, and I especially appreciate how steady the temperatures remain. My green tea no longer tastes burnt, and my baby formula prep time stays consistent every single day.

[Check VEVOR EKA-3.2ED price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b0dgpqswpk/)

**Convenience in Design**

What makes this device even better is the little conveniences that make everyday use simpler. The 360-degree rotating base allowed me to grab it from any angle, which is handy when the kitchen chaos takes over. Cleaning was unexpectedly easy, too – the lid separates effortlessly from the body. If you’re cautious about hygienic practices like me, this design might impress you. 

**Premium Build Quality**

The construction of this dispenser deserves a special mention. The food-grade build ensures you’re drinking from a safe, rust-resistant inner liner made from 304 stainless steel. This not only makes it durable but also gives me peace of mind knowing I’m not exposing my family to harmful materials. Even the spout and inner cover share the same quality, reinforcing how much thought went into ensuring this is great for families.

**Adverse Aspects**

Despite its perks, there are areas where this water boiler could improve. For example, while the 3.2-quart capacity is great, a household with heavier usage might find themselves needing to refill it more often than desired. Additionally, its power cord’s length could use a slight extension since I had to rearrange my counter layout just to fit it next to an outlet. These are minor things but can affect the overall experience.

- Limited capacity for very heavy usage families.
- The power cord could be longer for greater placement flexibility.

**Competing Brands**

When compared to alternative products like Zojirushi and Tiger water boilers, I noticed this VEVOR dispenser holds up remarkably well. Zojirushi models often boast slightly better temperature control, especially in maintaining minimal fluctuations, but they come with a significantly higher price tag. On the other hand, Tiger offers similar safety options with compact designs but lacks the manual dispensing mode this one has. The 360-degree rotating base and durability tilt the argument favorably towards the VEVOR product for everyday family use. 

**Smart Spending**

Balancing quality and price is rarely easy, but the VEVOR EKA-3.2ED manages to hit a sweet spot. It may lack the refinement of high-end water boilers but provides excellent reliability, modern features, and robust safety measures well within a family-friendly budget. If you’re looking for a combination of essential functionality with just enough bells and whistles, this device is a strong contender.

Without this, I won’t be able to determine exactly what it is in the coffee bean and the roasting of it and the pulling of a shot that I particularly like.

In case this is you, and you are worried or don’t know what to expect, I wanted to share my experience since I’m unfortunately a pro now. Hope this helps 🫶

Please know that you are TOTALLY OKAY!!! You are going to be fine and once it’s all over you will see that there was nothing to worry about with the prep and procedure. Please don’t worry too much or lose any sleep over it 🙏

One thing that really helped me was pre-prep, which was daily MiraLAX (1 dose) about 4 or 5 days ahead of prep!! Mircodosing MiraLAX really helped - my procedure was on Wednesday and I started MiraLAX daily on Fri. I was clear after Dulcolax and first prep drink and things ran smoothly - no cramping or pain whatsoever since everything was already lose. I also ate low-fiber and even a little bit low-volume especially in the couple of days leading up to prep day. 

- [ ] Get high protein gelatein (got orange, but pineapple might taste better next time)
- [ ] Get toilet seat cover and charge up iPad, was helpful to watch something I was invested in 
- [ ] Broth was a life saver 
- [ ] Green jolly ranchers & gummy bears (not red)
- [ ] Nestle clear liquid boost drink (delicious & nutritious)
- [ ] Eat low fiber and less volume the week leading up to prep, helps a lot
- [ ] With this method I was clear after first part of prep 
- [ ] ONCE YOURE CLEAR, YOURE CLEAR 🙌 (or slightly green) 



Prep Day - 
- [ ] Starting earlier is better because you are super tired and super hungry (this was actually the only bad part) - I moved everything earlier by 2 hours 
- [ ] I was already loose & watery after Dulcolax, only needed to take that part of prep once
- [ ] Actual prep was no problem (no nausea or cramping whatsoever) with Gatorade Zero Sugar 24 oz and MiraLax (half bottle each time) 2x total. I did Glacier Cherry flavor Gatorade because it’s white and delicious 👍 I drank through a straw but it didn’t taste bad or have a weird texture, I just did it because vibes. 
- [ ] I drank it slowly over 1.5 hrs (so like a sip every 3-5 mins) but I could have probably gone faster and been fine. It didn’t taste like anything except Gatorade, did not notice MiraLAX at all and it dissolved completely. 
- [ ] Had a light dinner the night before, and kept with low-fiber so I was probably more hungry than I should have been starting out, but you do you!
- [ ] Lost like, 2-3 pounds on scale in total (immediately came back 😭)
- [ ] When hungry, broth and other hot liquids helped a lot. Even tea. Ate broth with a spoon and it did feel like eating soup. 
- [ ] Orange Gelatein was not great tasting but did two of them and the high protein helped 
- [ ] Did 1 cup Brodo broth around every 1-2 hrs 
- [ ] Hunger eventually subsides, but it was worse in the morning since I ate a super small dinner the night before. Might want to reconsider for next time, or otherwise eat broth immediately in the morning. Coffee didn’t really help as much as I thought it would at staving off hunger but I did avoid caffeine withdrawal.
- [ ] Gas-Ex was actually a spicy (?) kind of peppermint. Maybe doesn’t apply to you but I thought the gas-ex was harder to get down than the prep. Def would have preferred a different flavor. 
- [ ] Stomach made all the weirdest noises - before, after, during. Did not have a ton of gas though.
- [ ] Prep usually started working an hour after finishing and dried up when I wanted to sleep. I went maybe 10-12 times per prep drink (12 oz each). I was clear after 1st half of prep but it was so easy I did the second half anyway. 
- [ ] I used wet wipes and A&D ointment and Vaseline but in the end I wasn’t actually sore at all, maybe because I was clear so quickly. Dabbing vs wiping though💯

Procedure Day 
- [ ] Took a Waymo there, no probs - was too tired to be anxious. Woke up around 5a to shower for a 6:30a check-in, evacuate bowels again (was mostly dried up) and even did Wednesday Addams braids and threw on some make up. Why not be fabulous ya know. 
- [ ] After check- in, got an IV. It went in hand because I def wanted to be KO’d for the procedure and crux of arm can be harder to ensure proper anesthesia dose if bent while asleep. I felt the IV a bit but like 1/10 on pain. Didn’t watch needle go in bc hand IV freaks me out. No soreness or bruising after. 
- [ ] Procedure room - Felt anesthesia going in because it stings a little bit, like 2/10 pain and it’s the last thing I remember before waking up in recovery. 
- [ ] KO’d for about an hour and woke up groggy and a bit dizzy in recovery but no other reactions or bad experiences with Anesthesia.
- [ ] Was a little confused on the way home and dizzy walking to/from car. Needed help from my husband. I didn’t say anything weird or wild, I had my faculties, was just kind of groggy. 
- [ ] Came home and ate breakfast burrito, latte and 1/2 donut and stomach was gurgling but no pain or nausea
- [ ] Needed to rest bc of lack of sleep - didn’t do any work but was able to take my doggo for a short walk before dinner and hang out & watch TV & easily communicate with everyone. I was not groggy and was back to myself in like an 1.5 hrs after procedure. Will def continue to choose to be KO’d for next ones, but I heard sedation without anesthesia is not so bad. To each their own — I preferred to sleep through it. 

- didn’t need Zofran at all
- didn’t need Tylenol at all
- it’s more of a bummer to not eat or sleep, the actual prep and procedure were no problem. 
- not at all like experience in hospital when I was diagnosed


**** WAS SO SO SO FINE!!! 
So fine. Read it again 100x times. 
Waste no time stressing about this. 
Please. It was so easy. And so painless.

1nb0epx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1nb0epx/if_you_could_ask_jesus_a_question_over_a_cup_of/,"If you could ask Jesus a question over a cup of coffee, what would it be?","At first, I thought I'd give to him this:

""You saw everything, you were there when it all was happening, right?""

Some other ones are at the back of my mind:

“What do You see in me that I don’t see yet?” → That gets at identity, and He’d answer with truth you could build a life on.

“What breaks Your heart the most right now in this world?” → He’d hand me His perspective, not just my own guesses.

“Who do You want me to reach that no one else is reaching?” → That could reset my whole sense of calling.

“Lord, what are we blind to right now in Your church?”
→
That kind of question is asking for His diagnosis. Every generation thinks they’re fine, but Jesus told Laodicea, “You say, ‘I am rich, I have prospered,’ not realizing you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.” (Rev 3:17).

Ultimately, I just feel so frustrated. If I could see Jesus face to face I'd probably just fall or cling to him and never let go, the only sound you'd hear from it is the sound of everything in me breaking and being healed at the same time.

 Ugly crying, laughing at myself for ugly crying, probably saying something dumb like “i always knew You’re real!” even though of course He is. My knees giving out, arms wrapped around Him like I’m five years old again, and somewhere in heaven an angel’s probably shaking their head with a smile like, “Yep, another one down.”

***That's the thing, guys***, I think, any single question we dream up is going to feel small in front of Him. We’re talking about standing before the Maker of galaxies, the One who holds every breath. Words shrink.

Even in Scripture, when people met God face-to-face, their questions often collapsed into silence. Job wanted answers, then when God showed up, Job said, “I put my hand over my mouth.” Isaiah cried, “Woe is me.” John fell on his face as if dead. The presence was the answer.

Maybe that’s the real point: the perfect question doesn’t exist. What matters is the posture. You could stand there and just say, “Jesus.” The cry itself is the question and the answer at once.
