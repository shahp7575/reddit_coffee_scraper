I need some guidance from the amazing **Emapta HR/Managers** out there.

I was one foot out the door, midway through my **Emapta onboarding**, genuinely excited to start. But then, my current VA employer pulled the *ultimate* move and hit me with a counter-offer that was, frankly, something I couldn't walk away from. We're talking ""stay home and buy better coffee"" money.

So, I had to do the hard thing: I informed my hiring manager and my offer was **rescinded**. I feel genuinely bad for the time I took up, but a guy's gotta eat (not saying Emapta's offer wasn't good. They offered a six-digit salary for the position).

Now for my two urgent questions:

# 1. The ""Can I Ever Come Back?"" Question

Look, I genuinely love what I heard about Emapta, and I might be looking again in the future. **Did I just get permanently banned from Emapta?** Am I on the dreaded ""Do Not Hire"" list for life, or is the door still cracked open if I want to re-apply someday?

# 2. Security Bank Account

During the onboarding, you guys set up a **Security Bank payroll account** for me. Since I never actually started and my offer was pulled, what happens to it?

**Does Emapta/Security Bank automatically cancel it, or do I need to actually drag myself to a branch and close it manually?** I'm trying to avoid an unexpected bank maintenance fee situation down the road.

Seriously, any insight from current Emapta employees, HR, or even someone who's been in this exact spot would be a massive help. Thanks!",1,1760472674.0,buhaydigital,1,1.0,False

1o6q5u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1o6q5u7/does_scotchgard_fabric_protector_4106104_truly/,Does Scotchgard Fabric Protector 4106-10-4 Truly Repel Stains Effectively Review,"**Daily Use and Practical Experience**

The Scotchgard Fabric & Upholstery Protector 3M 4106-10-4 is one of those products I didn’t think I needed until I started using it. Within hours of application, I realized how much of a difference it made in my day-to-day life. From cozying up on the couch with a coffee mug to seeing my toddler’s sticky hands wander across our dining chairs, I quickly appreciated the extra layer of defense this protector provides. Applied on couches, rugs, and even some of my wardrobe staples, it never altered the textures or colors. It’s clear this product is not just practical—it’s reliable.  

**Effective Stain and Liquid Repellence**

As someone who frequently entertains guests, accidental spills are almost a guarantee. Testing this spray on my linen couch and upholstered dining chairs was an absolute revelation. Any liquid—even red wine—seemed to bead up instantly, giving me enough time to wipe it off easily before it could sink in. The fact that it doesn’t leave a greasy residue or change the fabric’s texture is a huge plus. It’s particularly handy for furniture in heavy-traffic areas, where stains are all too common.  

**Versatility and Range of Use**

What impressed me was how adaptable this fabric protector is. I tried it on not just indoor upholstery but also on items of clothing like ties and jackets, and the results were stellar. Even my vintage silk scarf benefitted from the spray’s gentle yet effective formula, as it didn’t harm the delicate material. It stands out for being safe on delicate fabrics like silk and wool, something not many similar products can claim.  

[Check Scotchgard Fabric & Upholstery Protector 3M 4106-10-4 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b079x2k39z/)

**Positives**

- Strong repellence against liquids and stains ensures extended life of most fabrics.  
- Suitable for diverse materials including silk, wool, upholstery, and clothing.  
- Easy to apply with a clear and odorless finish that doesn’t alter fabric aesthetics.

**Weaknesses**

- The spray nozzle is a bit inconsistent, occasionally leading to uneven sprays.  
- One bottle may not adequately cover larger furnishings like sectionals or large drapes.  

**Ease of Application**

The one-step application process truly couldn’t be simpler. I found it almost therapeutic, spraying an even mist over various surfaces and watching it dry clear with no odd smell lingering behind. Its fast-drying quality is great for impromptu applications when guests are about to arrive, and I need to quickly armor up against inevitable messes. 

**Market Rivals**

When compared to other similar fabric protectors like Vectra and Guardsman Fabric Defense, this one outshines them in both protection and user-friendliness. While Vectra offers excellent repellency as well, the ease of use and lack of odor make the Scotchgard Protector a better choice for less hassle. Guardsman, on the other hand, doesn’t perform as well on delicate materials. However, both competitors do offer better spray mechanisms, which is one area where the Scotchgard Protector could improve.  

**Quality for Price**

For the level of protection and versatility offered, the price stands justified when compared to alternatives on the market. I think of it as an investment into the longevity of my belongings, especially high-maintenance items like silk clothing and upholstered furniture. While it’s not the cheapest product out there, its performance makes it well worth the cost for what it saves me in fabric replacement or professional cleaning services.

I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

Towards the end of the semester, we had to give a presentation for that class, and Johnny did his presentation on caffeine and nicotine.

Let's start by addressing what most of you are probably thinking. Coffee and cigarettes, the easiest fucking topics. He picked the two most well-known, over-researched drugs in Neuropharmacology. He's not exactly opening up a new frontier or anything.

I was not expecting much, but during presentation day, Johnny did even worse than anything I could have imagined. Our professor simply graded your presentation, and did not require for people to submit anything and simply asked questions at the end to verify you did your presentation.

After his presentation started, Johnny turned around and read the title of his slide with a monotone voice, and it only got worse by the minute. It looked like he was discovering his ""Mechanism of Action"" slide for the first time along with the audience, and me and my other friend both texted each other and agreed the bullet points on Johnny's slides were most likely all copy-and-pasted straight from an abstract he didn't even read.

Then we get to Johnny's ""Critical Analysis"" slide. It had two bullet points. Both were copy-and-pasted from an abstract. Neither were relevant. For those who don't know, ""Critical Analysis"" is typically the section where you criticize methodology, challenge assumptions, and compare findings with other research. Johnny, instead, said: ""Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, makes you more alert. Nicotine activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and .............is addictive"". Two basic facts that most people who didn't even take this class are already aware of. This was the part where me and my friend had to put our heads down to avoid laughing in class.

I was wondering what would happen once Johnny ended his presentation and our professor delivered his academic death blows, but Johnny prolonged his presentation and there was someone else who needed to present so our professors had to switch to the next person without asking questions to finish in time.

The worst part, he tried to tell us he got 29/30 on that presentation right after I said I got 28/30. On a presentation we had all seen him bomb, and he actually insisted on this and he even brought it up himself 3 months later.",1,1760471894.0,story,0,1.0,False

""You just have to take a statement from the wronged party, come on, I'll drive you pal."" Other mike flapped his lips like birds a wings, the type of bird that's trying to get out of the water. A duck maybe. 

  
""I'll grab my coat."" I responded and got up to head to the car. I didn't have a coat, but I thought I would make conversation. Another detective trick. 

  
The ride to the place we were going was uneventful. Other Mike described to me some unimportant things like the means and potential motivation for the robbery. I tried to nod along politely whilst remembering the plot of a somewhat uninteresting episode of The Twilight Zone. 

  
In the episode there's this guy in a library and he hates his wife. Next thing you know his wife magically get's raptured and he gets to read books forever, but he has bad eyesight and didn't plan ahead very well. What an idiot. ""I'll stay in the car"" Other Mike says as the car pulls up to a halt. 

  
""Stay in the car."" I say getting out fluidly after several momentum gathering rocks. The vehicle is, what I can only describe as, a car that is far too low to the ground. ""Someone needs to watch my coat."" I wink, so he knows that it's a joke between us now. He's either with me or against me.

I stride into the front door of the PlaceHolder Diner where Cindy meets me. How did I know her name was Cindy? I taught you the name tag trick didn't I? Which is a joke between us now. 

  
Cindy was a dime piece broad, wide as a barn, holding cut up coins. ""Detective"" She said seductively. I knew she was trying to seduce me because of some books I had read. I had no time for women. I was a cop, and I had cop things to do. 

  
""Listen Hussy"" I grabbed her wide shoulders, bigger than an NFL lineman, and calmly shook her. ""I need to speak to your boss.""

  
""Micro-agressions"" She said, angrily, but still probably seductively. The books were less clear on this. 

  
""I prefer the big type of aggressions honey."" I said rationally ""Now let me see your boss or you'll have the whole precinct lubed up and so far up your...... business you'll have to shit standing up."" I cleverly remembered that you couldn't tell a gal things would be up their ass so I changed it to business. I was, more or less, a modern gentlemen. 

  
""Mike! Get out here!"" She hollered with potential lust. I was Mike after all.



Mike showed up and brought me to his office. Another Mike, but how did it all fit together? I was onto something. 

  
His desk plaque read Mike RoAgressions, an odd name, probably Hungarian. He was a large man, but not as big as Cindy. Just large in the belly. He was fat, but in a polite way because he was *supposedly* the victim. ""Diamonds"" I said.

  
""Yes"" Said mike, wearing a fedora on top of his head like a baseball cap, but with a different type of brim. 

""What's the PlaceHolder Diner doing with diamonds, plural."" I said, seeing the obvious plot whole, as if for the first time. 

  
""That's none of your business."" He looked at my name tag, but I didn't wear one, only a badge that said ""Cop"" that I got at a German bachelorette party. 

  
""Mike"" I said, controlling the conversation in a way lesser men like Lesser Mike could only imagine. I didn't know what else to say, so I lit a cigarette and  gestured him to continue. 

  
""Look someone came in and stole some diamonds from our safe, they're kind of a family heirloom."" It was plausible, I had heard that some families owned things. Some of them even owned safes in which to keep valuables, but safes also held guns. 

  
""Guns?"" I said checking my hunch. 

  
""What?"" he responded slack jawed and goofy looking in a dumb hat, but his surprise checked out. I was a good cop. 

""Nevermind."" I said and lit another cigarette. 

  
""Chain smoker?"" He asked.

  
""Never touch the stuff, but you can if you want."" I cleverly lied, I didn't know what smoking a chain was, but I'm pretty sure I could arrest him for it. It took an honest man like me to know when to lie, and I was going to do it a lot. 

  
""Shouldn't you be writing some of this down?"" The man drawled at me, with what I can only assume was bad breath. My breath was bad, I had nothing but soup and cigarettes all day. I sipped from my mug, still French onion. ""Would you like some cream for that?"" He asked nodding at my mug. 

  
""Are you insane?"" I asked calmly. 

  
""You like it black?"" He responded.

  
""I don't really see the world like that."" With the racism out on the table I decided to make a quick exit, perhaps this strange racist man could tell that I wasn't a racist. Who know's what he would do then, we were too different to ever get a long. ""You have insurance I'll call you. I have to feed the meter."" I cleverly lied again, there were no meters in the diners parking lot, but he didn't know that.

  
When I got to the car Other Mike looked sweaty and out of breath. As if he had just run a small distance as a fat man. ""How'd it go?"" He asked through disguised deep breaths, the pervert was probably gooning in here. We had all thought about it, but good god man. 

  
""I think he's guilty."" I said. 

  
""The victim?"" Other Mike asked stupidly. 

  
I raised an eyebrow and said ""Sure"". Other Mike and lesser Mike shared a lot of similarities, their stature, perspiration, their odd potentially Hungarian last name. I knew Other Mike though, he didn't wear a fedora, but I think he might be too close to this case given all the other similarities. I pat the big fat dummy on the shoulder and say ""Hey, some cases aren't meant to be solved. How's my coat?"" I wink again, so that he knows that it's a really good joke. 

  
The ride back is pretty calm and nothing important happens. Mike is going on about how much some money will mean to his family, and some insurance thing. It sounds like boring dumb adult stuff that I have very little interest in. 

  
I'm just happy to get back to my desk, I have a pot of Chicken Noodle calling my name and honestly it's the only thing I can think about right now, I ran out of soup 15 minutes ago and I really just need a little bit more right now. I distract myself by thinking about another Twilight Zone episode. This one is about a guy on an airplane and he keeps seeing some sort of googah out on the wing. In the end I think the plane probably should've gone down. It's a better story. 

  
You can kill people in stories and it doesn't mean anything. It's just a ""Fuck You"" to the audience. Mikes still rambling on, something about not wanting to take the guilt anymore. He's in the wrong lane a bit and we're heading towards a semi-truck.

During your shift as a Barista you met this dorky, cat-obsessed guy. The two of you have been dating for a while and now he has invited you to his apartment. You finally get to meet the cat that he has been gushing over in every single one of your conversations.

During your visit you find out his cat is rather *clingy*.

So, here’s the thing. I was scrolling through a bunch of content strategies (classic late-night Reddit deep dive, am I right?) and stumbled upon this **faceless growth strategy** that’s actually, like, working wonders in Q2. Seriously, I couldn’t believe my eyes! 😅 

You know how we’re always looking for that magical formula to scale our content without putting ourselves out there too much? Well, I think I might’ve found a gem. Here’s the gist of it:

- **Automation is King:** First off, let’s talk about automation. There are tools out there that can generate stunning content for you without you lifting a finger. Who doesn’t want to sip coffee while their content gets churned out? ☕✨ Check out this handy guide I found [here](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/)—it’s helped me a ton. You get to maximize your productivity like a total boss!

- **Visual Appeal Matters:** Ever notice how faceless accounts grow like weeds? 🤔 It's not just because they’re mysterious. It’s because their visuals hit differently. Interactive infographics, memes, and sleek videos can draw people in without revealing every detail about yourself. Just be relatable!

- **Content Repurposing Royale:** Here’s a little pro tip—**repurpose, repurpose, repurpose!** Take that blog post and turn it into a thread, a podcast, or even a TikTok! The more you spread it around, the more visibility you gain. It’s like shouting in a room full of people until someone notices you.

- **Engage Without Showing Face:** If you’re camera-shy (same!), you can still engage with your audience effectively. Think polls, Q&As, or just good old-fashioned memes that resonate with their struggles. It’s like a friendship without the awkward small talk. 

Let’s be real for a second—**it feels good to see your efforts pay off** without doing every little thing yourself. Have you guys tried any of these strategies yourselves? Or maybe you have some hidden gems that have worked for you? 

I’m curious if any of you have found success with faceless strategies or if you think they’re just a passing trend. What do you think? Let’s dive into this rabbit hole together! 🐇💬

P.S. If you’ve got any cool tools or hacks that help with this kind of content creation, drop them below! You never know who might need a little inspiration. 😊",1,1760471627.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1o6ptsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1o6ptsi/mom_and_snacksfood/,Mom and Snacks/Food,"Mom tells me that she only eats the ""institutional food"" in the AL dining room at lunch and dinner and also says that she doesn't want any snacks in her room because they'll make her fat.  During a text chat with my sister and niece last night, we figured out at least some of the reality.

\-My sister buys her chips, pudding and fruit cups, and chili and clam chowder in cans.  They're always gone when she brings more.  I know Mom hasn't figured out how to use her microwave so either she's eating the stuff in cans cold, an aide is heating them up for her, or they're being stolen.  She says she hasn't eaten them. 

\-Mom also says she's cut down on her coffee consumption because she doesn't have a coffee maker even though she does.  

\-My Sis and niece visited Mom last week and an aide said Mom needs new pants and shirts, now size large. She reported that Mom doesn't miss the daily coffee klatch and drinks coffee at meals. 

Here's where we're conflicted.  Food makes Mom happy so I'm all for providing the snacks, in moderation, because it seems that her off-switch is broken.  My niece, who is in health care, suggested that we eliminate the snacks altogether.  Mom has limited mobility and osteoporosis so she's a fall risk.  My niece says that the extra weight will only compound that.  So it's happy versus healthy and safe I suppose.

Any opinions, advice, and solutions are welcome. TYA

Psychiatrist thinks I sound euphoric and hypomanic. I just really don’t resonate with that. I feel happy, and I feel like I see where she’s coming from with euphoric, but I’m just happy to finally be happy. 

I guess I am talking a lot more than usual. And I am having trouble sleeping. But is this not normal on adderall? I don’t know. Of course i’m open to what she thinks but I feel like i’m being misunderstood.

I haven’t been very irresponsible, impulsive, or had an inflated ego. 
Despite adderall, 2 cups of coffee and zoloft, most days I feel good, happy, and energetic, but still mentally and physically tired.

1o6pqny,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1o6pqny/the_black_hills_part_5_of_5_epilogue/,[The Black Hills] - Part 5 of 5 + Epilogue,"Jonas reached the doorway to the research annex. It was open. The darkness inside stretched toward him. 

He edged himself toward the door, feeling the interior wall blindly with his hand, looking for a light switch. He half expected a hand from the dark to reach out and clutch at his own. To pull him into the maw and claim him like the others. But nothing came. He found the switch and flipped it on. As the room’s overhead LED lights came to life, the true space of the structure became apparent.

The room was large; nearly 20 feet high, quite deep and around 100 feet wide. It was ringed with workstations. In the center, a large raised platform provided the site team an interior location to finalize extraction of specimens and fossils in a controlled environment. On the opposite wall, a large, double-wide garage door sat closed. To Jonas, it looked like the door was designed to allow for trucks to transport material or large chunks of rock containing potential specimens into the annex when needed.

Jonas saw two more bodies to his right, both on the floor. A pool of blood under both of their heads had begun to congeal on the gray concrete floor. Their blotchy, bloated faces were turned toward him. Their dead eyes stared blindly, crusted with dry blood. His stomach lurched as he saw a group of rats gnawing at the dead. 

Past the bodies he saw the source of the noise he’d heard. A cluster of brooms on the floor, likely knocked over by the rats. He shouted at the rats and they scurried away, past the fallen brooms and out of sight. 

Jonas approached the platform. It was large and circular, rising three feet off the ground. A massive chunk of sedimentary rock sat atop the dais, having been cut from somewhere onsite and transported into the annex through the oversized door at the far end of the hangar. 

Jonas took a few tentative steps toward the platform and peered at the massive mound of stone. His eyes drifted toward the center, where he saw the archaeologists had cleared away sections with their hammers and brushes, revealing fossils in the rock. 

The bones were remarkably well preserved. Though some were still locked firmly within the stone, Jonas could make out the human form of each body. He could tell immediately they were grouped together in a way that looked as if they’d been huddled together when buried. He couldn’t imagine how old the skeletons were. 

He scanned some nearby papers, scribbled with notes. He picked up a folder jammed with loose leaf paper and flipped through the pages. He saw a lot of words he couldn’t define, so he tossed the folder back onto a desk.

As Jonas got closer he noticed something unusual. The bones were smooth in some places, but in others, they were dark and rough. Almost as if they’d been burned. He found that odd. 

An archeologist had once told him while filling out some delivery paperwork that the entire site could be compromised with the mere oil from his skin. But that seemed a little ridiculous now. So he stretched forward, reaching out and feeling the body nearest his reach. Sure enough, the darker places were rougher and the bones felt pitted and asperous. They’d definitely been burned. 

He ran a hand along the exposed bone, realizing it was broken in some places as well. Subtle fractures ran in grooves along some of the longer bones. He put a hand on an exposed skull and realized, sadly, how both these ancient bones and the dead archeologists throughout the site were no longer very different at all.

Finally, he’d seen enough. He had shared far too much time with the dead of the Castle Peak site. He picked up the nearby folders and papers to bring to the authorities and using his phone, took a photo of the bodies in the hangar. He figured the material and photographs might help shed light on what happened to the people here. He decided to take more photographs in the crew quarters on his way back to the truck. Then he hustled toward the door. 

As he rounded the edge of the platform he took one last look at the large rock at the center of the annex. Not watching where he was going, his thigh caught the edge of one of the workstations. 

Cursing, he dropped the folders, papers scattering everywhere. He rubbed his thigh and looked down. Hundreds of sheets of paper had drifted all around him. He dropped to a knee, grunting, and began gathering what he could. Papers that had drifted beyond his reach he left, not willing to spend more than a minute longer than needed here. Clearly nothing was disturbing anything at this site. Except the rats. It was a temple of the dead now. Let the authorities do their own jobs. 

As he got back to his feet something on some stray papers caught his eye. Some sheets of paper were stamped with the word “Biohazard.” He’d transported hazardous chemicals his whole life, he knew his way around the label. Why anything at an archeology site would be marked biohazard was beyond him, though. Guyer had transported chemicals here, sure, but nothing overly serious.

He bent and picked up a few of the papers. He scanned them quickly. He could make sense of very little. There were graphics and charts, and he saw a heading noting they represented a DNA analysis. Other papers had all sorts of calculations. Everything was over his head. But he shuddered when he saw the word virus more than once and on many of the pages. 

He saw handwritten notes in the margins of the pages, talking about activation and cellular synthesis. He glanced back toward the platform, his mind rapidly putting pieces of the puzzle together. 

The bones had been burned. Partially. He’d found that odd. He found it odd no longer. Whoever had burned those bodies so long ago had done so with purpose, realizing then what he was realizing now. And what the Castle Peak team had realized far too late. These bodies had been infected with something. Something sinister and something horrible. And the Castle Peak team had re-activated it somehow.

Jonas ran through the doors and through the hallway, sprinting toward the exit. None of the dead had stirred. None blocked his path. 

He bolted through the lobby and into the cool night air. Once again, the only sounds around him were the crickets, the cicadas and the stir of the wind through the ponderosa pines. 

He bent to catch his breath and walked quickly to his truck. Only once he was safely behind the wheel and the cabin doors were locked did his breathing steady. He took out a bottle of hand sanitizer from his dashboard and rubbed his hands vigorously. Then he cranked the engine to life, rolled down his window and lit a cigarette. He kept a pack in his glove box for long days and today he’d be finishing the pack. 

Once his nerves settled he engaged the transmission and climbed out toward the main entrance, through the gate and onto the road, leaving the Castle Peak site behind forever.  

**EPILOGUE**

It was close to midnight and Kimberly Sutton was exhausted. She’d been on her feet for hours and the Hermosa Diner had been slammed for most of her shift. But closing time was in sight. The majority of the night’s customers, truckers passing through heading east mostly, had left. Cecil was finally shutting down the kitchen. 

Kimberly surveyed her section. She dropped a final bill on two of her tables, smiling pleasantly as she went. She also was mindful to lean over just so to show a hint of her chest to the men. Then she went to check in on her last customer. 

The gentleman had sat fairly still for the better part of an hour, just sipping coffee. He’d refused food and Kimberly thought he looked under the weather. His eyes red, his skin pale. He had an awful cough too. She’d been worried about him when he arrived, but he said he’d just been battling a cold for a few days and was finally coming back around. 

Most people would avoid anyone showing signs of illness, but for Kimberly a tip was a tip. So she’d lingered momentarily and told him what a sharp uniform he had on. He’d said he was a security guard of some sort for an archeology site over in the Hills. Was just passing through Hermosa, he’d said, but hadn’t mentioned any final destination. But that was common for customers. Years ago Kimberly had stopped asking questions.

She now found him hunched over his coffee cup. 

“More coffee love?” she asked.

The man looked up at her, slowly. He looked worse now than before. Kimberly instinctively took a step backward. His face was blotchy. His nose was bleeding. He dabbed at it with a napkin. Kimberly saw the napkin was bright red, too. Others like it were scattered on the table.

“Good lord honey, you look like you may need to go see a doctor. There’s an urgent care up in Rapid City that’s open 24 hours a day. You should head there straight away.”

“Maybe I’ll do that,” the man croaked, clearing phlegm from his throat. He lurched to his feet and Kimberly took a step back, giving him a wide berth. He looked unsteady on his feet. He dug his hand in his pocket and fished out a $10. As she reached to take the bill, the man sneezed violently. Kimberly tried to turn as she felt the spray hit her face. 

“Goddammi--” she shouted, but before she could finish the words the man collapsed onto the floor. She shouted for Cecil to call 9-1-1 and dropped to a knee. 

As the man began to shake, Kimberly screamed. The diner succumbed to chaos. She put her hand to her face to wipe the man’s spit from her eyes and mouth. The breath left her when she saw her hand came away moist and she saw the man had sprayed her with blood. 

“Jesus!” she sputtered as other customers hustled over to help the man convulsing on the floor of the Hermosa Diner. 

All the while, outside, the night air whispered through the ponderosa pines, bur oaks and spruce trees, stretching itself at will and laying claim to the wide open spaces shaded in browns and greens. ",1,1760471392.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

Diagnosed with Bi Polar 1 with Psychotic Features and Generalized anxiety disorder. I also have Ulcerative Colitis.

So, here's my situation! I was on 15mgs for a month. I quit cold turkey due to blood tests showing insanely high triglycerides, very high cholesterol and my liver ALT in the fatty liver range. I even formed a pregnant like fat abdomen. It’s gone now since I quit and lost weight.

So, I quit around 2 months ago. My sleep has been horrible as in 0-3 hours a night if I’m lucky. Some nights I just lay with my eyes closed all night. I find if I do this I occasionally get little micro sleep dreams and it leaves me more refreshed compared to me staying up all night with my eyes open watching the wall.

I don't have any other symptoms. Just poor sleep.  I do notice that I now need to drink coffee now to have a BM. Without it I’m constipated. I wonder if this is due to how badly the Zyprexa down-regulated my serotonin in my gut?

Do you know if this is normal? At first I had a hard time with eating, nausea, light headed when standing up. Sweating and anxiety. Now I just can't sleep?

The odd thing is this!!! The Zyprexa was causing me to have nighttime panic attacks and horrible inner restlessness like akathisia that resulted in me not being able to sleep. So I had poor sleep while on it. Now I have poor sleep while off it?

I found Doxepin 100mg with seroquel to help. l've tried Valium, Klonopin and Ativan for help. Valium and Ativan works best. Took a 1mg Klonopin and had to lag there for hours before I took a 2mg Ativan and it finally worked.

It feels like my brain forgot how to naturally fall asleep without Zyprexa? It's like I have no normal sleep drive?

She's not my first, I've been in practice for about 6 years. I have of course bonded with other clients but this one and I have a really good rapport and bond, sometimes I will extend the session by 10 mins just so we can shoot the shit and have a bit of a chat about books/games that we have a shared interest in. Our professions are also similar enough that we have a lot of overlap. We're both ND and struggle with friends, in particular they've mentioned not having any real friends and how this weighs them down. 

I have never once in my professional career had the inclination to have unhealthy boundaries before, but honestly sometimes I feel like saying to this client that I'd like to finish therapy together so we can be friends instead and maybe just go for a coffee. 
 I'm honestly NOT going to because my own inner sense of belief that breaking boundaries can be a slippery slope and it would trigger me into an anxiety spiral,  but I'm interested to hear the reasons/personal experiences of this being a big no and why?
 
Like I understand the relationship would always have a strange power dynamic as a result, but it's not exactly breaking a client's trust like sleeping with them would be? 
Or I guess if there's any stories the other way, of people who HAVE became friends with a client I'd be interested to hear about that too.

The city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) has filed a lawsuit accusing Starbucks of wrongfully firing barista Karmen Rich without “just cause,” violating the city’s Fair Workweek Law. This marks the third such case against the coffee chain—proof that NYC won’t tolerate corporate abuse of power.

Officials made it clear that even massive corporations aren’t above the law. The Fair Workweek Law gives workers the right to fair treatment and job security, and when companies cross that line, the city strikes back hard. Like a pitbull tearing through a sock puppet, New York’s enforcement agencies can dismantle even the biggest brands if they exploit their employees.

1o6pms3,https://v.redd.it/gurafuhjs4vf1,Harpo Stuffy Lore: Poop Emoji Pillow,"Pasted from my [KoFi blog](https://ko-fi.com/post/Stuffy-Lore-Poop-Emoji-X8X81MTLPK), where you can buy me a rhetorical coffee if you are so inclined, or rather rhetorical cans of cat food for Groucho and Gummitch, since I do not drink coffee.

Most of Harpo’s stuffies have a story behind them, as I only bought a few of them to make videos about specific subjects. Doing a series of these stories was one of the many great ideas I didn't follow through on while he was alive. 

When TikTok served up a poop emoji video as a memory, the caption turned into this, the first entry in a book of stuffy lore. I suppose it’s appropriate that it begins with the darkest one, which speaks to the darkness that has always kept me from sharing more than a fraction of the joy that was Harpo with you. I promise the rest will be both shorter and sweeter. 

Feel free to just skip to the **POOP EMOJI** in this one. 

After Portland passed a rent control law, we got evicted, along with thousands of other long-term tenants. We hid with my friend and neighbor, Leanne. I wasn't supposed to be on the property, so for seven months, I didn’t leave her apartment except very late at night.

Harpo would have died of cancer during this time if she had not stepped up, trusting me to pay her back even though she had no reason to think I'd ever be able to. Just 15 minutes after we got the call that he'd survived the surgery, management slid a note under the door. We were caught. 

They gave me 30 days to get out, and gave her 30 days to give notice, or she would get evicted too. She had wanted to give notice for years, but couldn't save enough to do so without a roommate, and couldn't get a roommate, because she was a hoarder. But after 7 months of my paying half, she was almost ready to go.

But I was not, as I'd only just finished paying off the eviction. Less than 48 hours before I would have had to take the cats back to the shelter and look for one myself, I got a lead from a Reed alum who saw my post on the school switchboard, who told me about a post she'd seen on NextDoor.

An abusive alcoholic widow, whose abusive alcoholic husband had stepped drunkenly into traffic, whose teenage daughter had moved in with a middle-aged man, was offering the daughter's room to anyone who would enable her to drink unimpeded by domestic responsibilities. Eight months later, she picked up her son from school so drunk that she was swaying. I said the word alcoholic out loud for the first time. She told me to GTFO.

It was the first week of January 2020. I was already worried about Covid. A week later, I replaced the little birthday treat that had been sitting in my Amazon cart with a box of masks. The first patient in the US was recorded the day after my birthday. When I warned her about what was coming, she thought I was just trying to scare her into letting me stay, right up until the schools closed. 

By the time the eviction moratorium began, she hated me so much she'd threatened to take my cats and dump them for the coyotes if I didn't move out. But I had nowhere to go. I didn't dare leave the house unless I knew she was going to be gone for a while. I slept with wedges under the doors. 

After her teenage daughter came back, she decided to return to the pretty house in a nice neighborhood where she'd been when I first arrived, which was now occupied by her adult daughter and her friends, all of whom were servers who had just lost their jobs. I got to take over the lease on the leaky, moldy, structurally dangerous, illegally wired, vermin-infested, hazardous debris-strewn dump we'd moved to. I couldn't believe my luck.

Her son left the **POOP EMOJI** pillow behind, and I started encouraging Harpo to bring it to me. He would pick it up, only to conclude that it was too awkward, and abandon the enterprise. But I kept including it in the stuffy piles, and periodically spent a few minutes actively working on it with him. I was determined to wring some small amount of joy out of the trauma of that terrible time. 

Harpo’s stuffy skills grew steadily over the next few months. I started finding the poop pillow a few inches from where I’d left it, then a few feet. Alas, I did not actually get to see him carry it [the first time he actually brought it.](https://youtu.be/ygUWutwgj7k?si=TnKnZzplTGDwnCEy) But after a year of periodically including it in piles to see if he’d do it on his own, working with him for a little while when he didn’t, and then putting it away again before he got annoyed and frustrated, [I finally did.](https://youtu.be/-4nFDta7leQ?si=wfVslIE3ejrNfvTf)

**price & location** The apartment (28e green st) is on the edge of the campustown, so you need to walk >15min to the campus or wait for the every 15–30min bus. As a luxury apartment the cheapest 2bd/2br is 11xx+105utilities and the cheapest 1bd/1br is 19xx+utilities (nearly as high as Dean/Hub/... but with a much worse location). Personally speaking that is CRAZY, completely overpriced

**management** There are also a lot of management/maintenance issues

* They claim that there's a ""luxury coffee bar"" but the coffee machine always runs out of coffee/chocolate powder/milk powder so it's always unusable, and no refill. Many other amenities are similar
* There're frequently loud noises during quiet hours and overnight guests, which violate the lease contract. But the office just told me that they're not responsible for that
* When I moved in, I was initially assigned two wrong units before given the correct one. Also, there're still some vacant units but they refused me to transfer (the lease contract allows internal transfer)
* I joined a resident group chat and many residents reported that their food deliveries were stolen. Some former residents reported that the office told them their deposit hadn't been sent out in early Oct

tbh **I don't recommend any of those so-called ""luxury apartments"" like POG/Here/Seven07/Dean/Hub etc.** I've noticed many cheaper and better options in the university ave/green st/railway/wright st rectangle and at the south of green st, including some <1000/mon 1bd rooms.

I even told my colleague to go grab coffee while I guided everyone and walked them through what to do, just to make up for my mistake.

Partner and parents,"This isn’t so much about *me* being the asshole, as I need to understand WHO is the asshole in this scenario - apologies if this isn’t allowed! 

My (37f) partner (41m) and toddler recently went to visit my parents with our 16 year old dog. Full disclaimer, I know our dog is a little bit annoying - she’s in probably the last year of her life, so she doesn’t settle down easily and is often pacing / panting heavily. She isn’t destructive or incontinent or anything like that though. 

My parents were not very subtle about the fact that our dog was irritating them - my mom said a few things along the lines of “I don’t know how you live like this” “I would have put her down already” etc. Basically as soon as we got there, my dad grabbed her and put her outside, and slammed the door in a pretty passive aggressive way. Within a few minutes she was whining to be let in - she’s not an outside dog, it was hot out, and she’s like senile and gets anxious if she can’t see us. My partner let her in, again kind of passive aggressively. This pattern continued for like the entire 4 days we were there, escalating in passive aggressiveness each time. At one point my parents dumped out her water dish because it was “making a mess on the floor” leaving her with no water (???) 

By day 2, my partner started being pretty visibly annoyed / grumpy and kind of shut down. He was admittedly very rude to my parents. He basically stayed in our bedroom for the rest of the trip and didn’t come on any of the little outings. In the mornings, instead of having coffee with everyone, he would walk to the coffee shop and buy one for just himself. My dad tried confronting him at one point like “hey you seem pissed off, what’s up” and he just dismissed him and was like “nope I’m fine” when he *clearly* wasn’t. I feel like I probably should have jumped in here but I’m super conflict adverse and have a pretty terrible relationship with my dad, so I generally go into freeze mode whenever things get awkward. 

Now we’re back, and my brother is telling me that my parents were “completely weirded out and disgusted by how disrespectful my partner was being. They said he was “walking around like he owned the place” and had no consideration for their home. My dad even said my partner was being a “giant baby” (lol) 

NO ONE is talking to me about this, I’m just hearing it through my brother. I feel like everyone is kind of an asshole and I’m annoyed at all of them, but I want to know who was the worst so I can figure out a plan moving forward because we’re supposed to spend Christmas there and I’m already dreading it.

I am pretty organized with this and have the ability to put a sticky tab with your user name on paid for items for a few hours or days.  Sales occur only with a PayPal request from me to you.  That is for your safety and my sanity.  So, please have your PayPal info at the ready and make sure your PayPal address is updated.  

I DO NOT HOLD PENS UNTIL THEY ARE PAID FOR.  Once a PayPal request has been sent by me, it will be cancelled in 10 minutes if the transaction hasn't been completed.

I am willing to negotiate reasonable deals, but no pen is reserved until it is paid for.  For example, if you want to buy 23 pens for a bit of a discount but someone pays for one of those pens before you do then that pen just can't be part of the deal.

📝 OVERVIEW
	•	Program Length: 12 weeks
	•	Schedule: 5 days/week (Mon–Fri, 1 hour)
	•	Primary Goals:
	•	Grow & shape glutes
	•	Tone upper body & core
	•	Lose body fat while maintaining/gaining lean muscle
	•	Training Style: Progressive overload on machines (gradually increasing weight, reps, or intensity every 1–2 weeks)
	•	Diet: High protein, slight calorie deficit at first, then slight surplus in glute-building phases.

🍽️ NUTRITION PLAN

🎯 Macros & Calories (Starting Point)
	•	Estimated TDEE: ~2,000–2,100 kcal/day (sedentary job + daily gym)
	•	Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Slight deficit → 1,800 kcal/day
	•	Phase 2–3 (Weeks 5–12): Maintenance to slight surplus → 2,000–2,100 kcal/day
Macro	Target
Protein	110–130 g/day (0.8–1g/lb)
Carbs	170–200 g/day
Fats	55–65 g/day

➡️ Protein is non-negotiable for glute growth and muscle tone.
➡️ Carbs support early-morning energy.

⸻

🥗 Sample Day of Eating (~1,900 kcal)

Pre-Workout (4:30 a.m.)
	•	1 banana + 1 scoop whey protein (≈ 200 kcal)
Breakfast (Post-Workout)
	•	3 egg whites + 1 whole egg
	•	1 slice whole grain toast
	•	1 cup berries
	•	Black coffee or green tea
(≈ 350 kcal)

Lunch
	•	4 oz grilled chicken or tofu
	•	1 cup rice or quinoa
	•	1 cup mixed veggies
(≈ 400–450 kcal)

Snack
	•	Greek yogurt + cinnamon + ½ scoop protein
(≈ 200 kcal)

Dinner
	•	4–5 oz salmon or lean ground turkey
	•	1 medium sweet potato
	•	Roasted veggies in olive oil
(≈ 450–500 kcal)

Optional Snack (if needed)
	•	Protein shake or cottage cheese
(≈ 150 kcal)

📝 EXTRA TIPS
	•	Warm up 5 min each session (treadmill incline walk or glute activation band work).
	•	Cool down 2–3 min stretching.
	•	Sleep: 7–8 hrs minimum—crucial for recovery & glute growth.
	•	Track progress: Take weekly photos, not just weight.
	•	Prioritize glutes: Always do hip thrusts first on lower days.

1o6p5cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o6p5cs/the_paragraph_that_shouldnt_exist/,The Paragraph That Shouldn’t Exist,"I’ve always believed that words have power. Every sentence, every comma, every carefully chosen adjective is a tiny spell. That’s what I tell myself to feel important while staring at a blinking cursor in my apartment at 2 a.m. But I didn’t know how literal that phrase could get… until last Tuesday.

I was stuck on my latest horror story — one about a creature that fed on fear, hiding in the corners of a room until you blinked. I wrote its description obsessively: “Skin like spilled ink, eyes like hollow lanterns, claws that could scrape memories from your skull.” I laughed at how ridiculous it sounded, sipping cold coffee, telling myself it was just fiction.

But then… I wrote the line that changed everything:

“And when it moved, the shadows obeyed.”

I paused, rereading it. A chill ran down my spine, like a draft had snuck in from nowhere. The lamp flickered. I shrugged it off. Writers get superstitious — it’s part of the job.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak, every whisper of wind against my window sounded alive. I told myself it was paranoia. Until I heard the scraping.

Not outside. Not in the hallway. But in the corner of my room. Slow, deliberate, like claws on wood.

I froze. My heart hammered, but curiosity — that damn curiosity — made me glance toward the corner.

Nothing.

I laughed. “It’s fine. You wrote it. It doesn’t exist.”

And then it stepped forward.

I swear, it was exactly like I wrote it. Skin like spilled ink, eyes like lanterns hollowed of light, claws scraping the hardwood. Its movements were unnatural, jerky in a way that made reality feel loose at the edges. The shadows in my apartment — the ones I had ignored — shifted and leaned toward it. They obeyed.

It tilted its head, like it was inspecting me. My own fear felt like a leash around my chest. I tried to speak. Words failed me.

I remembered the stories — folklore, old warnings about summoning things you don’t understand. But I wasn’t practicing rituals. I was writing. I had written it into existence.

Every instinct screamed to destroy the notebook, tear up the pages, burn the words. I did. Fire licked the edges of the last page. Smoke filled the room. But the thing… it didn’t flinch.

It hissed my own sentences back at me, voice like paper tearing.

“Shadows obey. Fear is food. I am hungry.”

I ran to the door. It followed. Faster than it should have been able to move. Faster than any natural law should allow. And the shadows… the shadows stretched toward me, forming dark, jagged hands that clawed at the walls, the floor, my ankles.

I barricaded myself in my bathroom, dripping sweat onto the tile, shaking, whispering apologies to my notebook. I couldn’t stop thinking about the sentence I had written: the one that had given it life.

Then I realized… it was still watching me. I could see it reflected in the bathroom mirror, grinning without moving its lips. The reflection was wrong. Its claws were longer, sharper, and the shadows behind it were writhing like snakes made of black smoke.

I understand now. Writing isn’t just imagination. Words are bridges. And some bridges are too dangerous to cross.

I’m still alive — for now. But every time I write a single sentence, I feel it in the room. Watching. Waiting. Hungry.

And I know… one day, it will step fully into my reality.",1,1760470075.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

i go gym heavy 5 days a week but ive always done this.

suna, steam rooms, cold plunges and for some reason when i went on holiday to Africa for 2 weeks, i had significant improvement, probs from the sun and air.

i go on walks daily in the fresh air 10k steps and i fixed my sleeping pattern.

all these things defiantly helped my improvement of the condition.

As the DM, I really wanna make the dinner event with Strahd feel super important, but also give my players a chance to dress up (maybe cosplay their characters) and just chill and chat, almost like a hangout session where they can relax and talk about the adventure and all that.
But, gameplay and lore aside, I need some help putting together a Strahd cosplay. It's my first time putting together something this elaborate and I have no clue where to start... I wanna buy/make just the basics for this first event, with some formal clothes and makeup that gives off Strahd vibes. And by the final battle, I plan to complete the cosplay with the rest of the props like a sword, the wolf fur, the bracers, shoulder pads, and all that...
I'm already getting things together to buy a white Victorian shirt with a ruffled front, some coffee-colored tailored pants, and a red vest with gold details. Maybe the cape would be cool too, and that ""belt"" he wears, which is more like a red fabric wrapped around his waist...
I found an old post here on the subreddit with a 100% Amazon cosplay, but it's kinda tight for my budget (I'm not buying in dollars, and the conversion is like 5x). I'd love some suggestions or tips, especially for the final cosplay. I have no idea how to make the shoulder pads, the cape, the wolf fur...

I arrive at the shop and there was a few people standing outside in the rain and a closed sign was being placed on the door. A girl whom was obviously the manager asked if I had a mobile order, I said yes and she said she would grab it for me when it was ready. She mentions that someone hit the fire hydrant just outside the store and they don’t have running water, she points and I see a hydrant flooding water into the bushes. I’ve worked as a manager in food service, so I know that by law they are required to close the store immediately, I tell her no problem and stand in the rain while waiting for my order. Poor girl was clearly panicking cause she was closing the store on her own, likely hasn’t had this situation dropped on her before.

Cue boomer, who walks past the 4-5 of us waiting outside and tried to open the door. When it wouldn’t open because it was locked, he begins violently shaking the door. Manager comes back and cracks the door open and asks boomer if he has a mobile order. Boomer says yes and demands to be let inside. Manager tells him no one is allowed inside cause there is no running water but she’ll happy to get his order for him. Boomer immediately starts shouting how it’s ridiculous he can’t come inside when it’s “pouring rain”. While it was raining it was by no definition pouring, just a light shower equivalent to you get sprayed with a squirt bottle.

Manager tries to calm him down and explains they cannot legally allow him to enter, boomer doesn’t care and starts yelling louder demanding to be let in. Eventually another coworker brings the manager his order and she hands it to him, he starts going off on how the order “better be right” and how it’s ridiculous that no running water means “the world comes to a stop”. 

Boomer eventually trots off to whatever hole he came from, manager is still panicking a bit but is just glad boomer is gone. She comes out to give me my order and I give a very sympathetic look to her which she appreciated. I should have told her not to let old bastards like boomer get to her or something but I didn’t want to keep her any longer than necessary.

It just really pisses me off that boomers cant accept that things happen outside of anyone’s control and that exceptions can’t be made for them. It was the same when I was in food service. Everyone else is usually understanding, but not boomers who think the world revolves around them. 

If that manager happens to be reading this, I hope your day gets better. And thanks for giving me a size up for free!",19,1760469693.0,BoomersBeingFools,10,1.0,False

1o6oywh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conures/comments/1o6oywh/considering_getting_a_conure/,Considering getting a conure,"Hello. I'd really like a conure because I think they look fun. However, I want to make sure I'm a good match and that I get one from the right source. 

About me

I have never owned a bird.

I've done some research. Probably not enough.

I work from home.

I have a 2 bedroom apartment. Carpet in the bedrooms, hardwood elsewhere. Wood burning fireplace in the living room. Not sure if I will end up needing it or not.

I live alone, hopefully not forever.

My washer, dryer, coffee pot, and microwave make noise with no silent option when they finish. 

Fake leather furniture.

I would like for it to be with me at my desk when I work. However, my office is in one of the bedrooms and I don't want it to nibble on all the wires I have for it's own sake. I also don't want it to poop all over the carpet or tear it up. Carpet can be cleaned, but I don't think I have a good solution for all the wires. This is currently my biggest concern. DP cables, ethernet cables, hdmi cables, mouse and keyboard, electronic desk, power cables, etc. I would also be okay with letting it roam but I would be concerned about lamp power cables. 

I have ceiling fans, but don't usually use them. Pretty much only when I try to sleep (one in bedroom). I figure I can cage it long enough to cool the place down if it gets really hot.

I would place the cage in the living room to give it the most sunlight possible. 

I visit family on the weekend. 35 minute drive. They would not keep it but probably would be fine if it visited with me.

There is a nearby vet, but they only treat parrots on Tuesdays for some reason.

I have a self cleaning oven, but does it matter as long as I don't use that feature?

I cook with stainless steel, cast iron, and glass. I have one non-stick baking sheet that I think is some kind of treated aluminum.

I love garlic, onions, and spice. Should I be concerned about it being out of the cage when I eat?

I like to go for drives around town in the afternoon or on weekends. I would be fine taking it with me as long as I can keep it in a travel pack or something. My seats are fabric and I don't want poop stains. Maybe if it could be trained to request a poop break, but I'm aware that is not likely. Otherwise I'm home the majority of the time.

My options, both GCC

2 year old male
Nearest place to adopt is 4 hours away. The price is 350 (USD). It's a single handler (I think). They are licensed, but they do not cage the birds. Therefore, I don't know how it will handle being separated from a flock, and put into a small cage for 4 hours to get it into my apartment's larger cage. They do not allow visits so I can't take the time get to know one other than about 30 minutes when I go to pick it up and decide which one. I'm worried my apartment would be a downgrade.

Juvenile (I think male, can't remember)
Petsmart is 15 minutes away. The price is 900. It is cute and lives in a small enclosure, so it could probably handle the transport better. I think my apartment would be an upgrade if I can keep it safe. Feathers are kind of dull in color so I worry about health.

*October 14, 2025, Ülker Sports and Event Hall*

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in basketball, chaos follows a formula. The most coherent odds come from Bovada, where **Dubai Basketbol** is a -167 favorite (implied probability: 67.1%) and **Fenerbahçe Beko** is a +155 underdog (39.2%). Other books like DraftKings and BetRivers list point spreads (-4.5 to -18.0) and totals (160.5–161.5), suggesting Dubai’s defense is tighter than a drumhead while Fenerbahçe’s offense is… well, let’s just say they’re not firing on all cylinders.

But here’s the kicker: **FanDuel** and **Fanatics** list Dubai at decimal odds of 1.0 (even money) and Fenerbahçe at 21.0 and 26.0. If that’s not a typo, it’s either a cruel joke or a warning that the universe itself is against Fenerbahçe. Let’s assume sanity prevails and stick with Bovada’s numbers.

**Team News: Injuries, Signings, and Circuses**  
Fenerbahçe started the season 1-2, losing heartbreakers to Zalgiris Kaunas and Kızılyıldız by a combined 4 points. Their offense? A broken thermostat—hovering near “hot” but never quite breaking through. Their defense? A sieve that leaks more than Istanbul’s overpriced coffee.

Dubai, meanwhile, is a new team in the league but carries the ghost of last season’s Fenerbahçe-Dubai championship dynasty. They’ve added **Sertaç Şanlı** (national hero, human highlight reel) and **Dzanan Musa** (a point guard with the court vision of a chess grandmaster). Think of it as upgrad

Anyone else would have blamed the restaurant and written a negative review but I also deliver and know what appears on that screen as annoying as it may be with what you are picking up. 

My hunger, my sick wife, my overworked self and all the stress over the weeks after an accident that is putting us on edge made me call you out on your excuse. I let you know to check the order and you kept doubling on it’s the restaurants fault, and how they only have you two pastries and a coffee.  I got heated but while I did not saw anything I would not want to hear I did cut you off mid-excuse. 

As a result of this mistake I ended up getting refunded only a portion and left paying several times more than a coffee and two pastries are worth and my sick wife had to go out because I had to be late to my zoom work meeting where I needed to be for trying to resolve this issue. 

The restaurant clarified that it seems you grabbed the coffee and pastries and left without checking since pastries are ready first.  I mean a $90 order with 5 whole meals is not nothing. And they are as great as I know them to be and gave her the order and some pastries for the trouble of taking an hour round trip. 

I think I made your day worse. I hope to apologize for that but I also hope you check your order because this is why we see other people deal with refund issues when they do not get their full order.  

I always stress about making sure I have everything.  And mistakes do happen, I’ve made mistakes where I did not get part of the order.  Usually a soda or something random like a straw.  

But I admit to it. And if I remember I did not get a straw for the drink they gave me midway I at least stop at a fast food restaurant and make sure to get sealed straw from them.  But I don’t blame the restaurant for not checking. I know I can’t check orders from restaurants that seal the bags but drinks are easier and all the meals left behind would have been easy. It was 8 items and you only got 3 visible items since the pasties are in a see-through box. 

I do hope your day gets better, you made a statement about how ruined it was and it left me thinking that is now how I want to feel, but keep going.  Stuff happens sometimes hope your day gets better and you do get better tips but just see if what you got makes sense.  So many times I do legitimately have to check a restaurant for forgetting something before I leave.  ",0,1760469401.0,UberEATS,3,0.5,False

Most of my subscribers all have scammer like emails with weird profile photos such as advertisements or stock photos with the watermark openly visible, just a quickly downloaded photo thrown onto it which looks extremely suspicious and are from different countries, mainly India and I'm based in the USA. Almost every person who joins uses the same exact Letter at the beginning of their ""fake name"" they choose and they're all one gender specific name too with the same letters. Without fail, someone would join and have a variant of a previous member all starting in, let's say ""T"", Trisha, Teresa, Tabitha, Tammy, Tally etc.

I'm getting money but in weird waves and at incorrect times than what people had joined on and weird amounts.

I feel like they're trying to hack into me and take my info or are bots or something, but I wasn't sure if bots can access buy me a coffee. Anyway, all the behaviors don't add up and I've caught subscribers using multiple accounts with different addresses and emails that look made up on the spot, auto generated and then have them flat out lie that it isn't them.

Is it possible for bots or people up to no good to get into your stuff and hack into your account? I'm just seriously weirded out and don't know what's going on or if anyone else has had this issue and knew the best way to resolve or figure out what's going on! It's all extremely sketchy and I don't know if this site let's scammers into your memberships or if there's a way to keep them out? Or at least a way to filter members from Buy me a coffees end, making sure these people are legitimate?

Thank you guys, I really hope I can get some answers that will be of a help. I'm trying the best I can with everything and have googled numerous things to no avail and am at my wits end of where to ask this question. Hope everyone is having a nice day! 😊 ",2,1760469366.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

My boss (non-technical, but thinks he’s the second coming of Steve Jobs with ChatGPT) decided to write a Python script to migrate data from one production DB to another.

He didn’t ask Dev or DevOps. 
He didn’t test. 
He just… vibe-coded it, using AI suggestions and some “it looked good to me” logic.

It gets worse:
- The migration didn’t fully complete.
- He noticed the data wasn’t there and asked, “Why didn’t it move?”
- Then he ran the script again with some edits.

Turns out the AI-generated code had a logic flaw and dropped the source DB!
Our golden source, I repeat, GONE.

Now we’re screwed.
Production is down HTTP 500 everywhere

Tomorrow morning there’s a meeting. 
He’s already blaming Dev and DevOps for “not having done the migration earlier”, and for “not preventing” this.

His words: 
“I tried to fix your ignorance.”

But even worse: “If we can’t get this back, I’ll fire half the team.” (and my project is blocked, basically)

We have no backups of the full DB, I believe. 
Just fragments and logs.
I pray that maybe someone cloned the database in secret

What the hell do we do now?

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

How do we approach this meeting without losing our jobs, and ideally, flipping this back on him without burning ourselves?

Any advice welcome.

A couple of weeks later, I went back as I found a small pea sized lump on my neck. 
The doctor I had was different, and very rude. I asked if we could run a full TSH panel to rule it out, as theres a family history. She told me it was “unnecessary” as my tsh was 1.8 and my thyroid was not enlarged. I then asked if we could still run it anyways as Im still exhausted, and it would make me feel better to rule it out. She then said, that it takes 4 weeks for the VD to work anyways, and that she wouldn’t run a test just because I asked as it would send people down rabbit holes if they did this.

Let's talk about that gut-wrenching pivot point every indie hacker knows too well. Picture this: It's late 2024, and I'm knee-deep in my first real SaaS side hustle - a simple tool for remote teams to track async feedback loops. I'd bootstrapped it with Figma mocks and a weekend of Next.js coding, fueled by those endless Notion notes on ""lean MVP magic."" Users trickled in from Product Hunt (shoutout to the upvote gods), and for a hot minute, it felt like I'd cracked the code. Churn was low, MRR hit a shaky $200, and I was daydreaming about quitting my day job to go full-time.

But then... reality logged in. Expenses started stacking up like unread emails: AWS bills creeping from $50 to $150, that one-off designer hire for the landing page ($300, worth it, but oof), and don't get me started on the coffee-fueled all-nighters that somehow translated to zero marketing budget. I remember staring at my Google Sheet ""projections"" one rainy Tuesday evening, heart sinking as the numbers laughed back at me. Revenue forecasts? Optimistic guesses based on ""if I post on Twitter enough."" Cash burn? A vague red flag waving ""you're toast in 4 months."" The anxiety hit hard, not just the math, but that nagging fear of letting down my own big talk. What if this was it? The classic bootstrapper's trap: so focused on building features that I ignored the financial skeleton underneath. Friends in the indie scene shared war stories over Discord (""Dude, I almost folded at month 3""), and it dawned on me - I wasn't alone, but that didn't make the spreadsheet staredown any less brutal.

Frustrated, I spent a weekend doomscrolling forums like this one (guilty as charged), hunting for anything that screamed ""financial clarity without an MBA."" That's when I stumbled on [eFinancial Models](https://www.efinancialmodels.com/): imho a goldmine of ready to tweak Excel templates that basically hand you the cheat codes for startup forecasting. No fluff, just plug&play sheets for SaaS specifics, like revenue projections tied to MRR growth, churn assumptions, and even CAC/LTV breakdowns that make investor decks look pro without the sweat.

Fast-forward a few tweaks later, and suddenly my ""wild guess"" sheet evolved into a beast: 3-statement forecasts showing break-even in 8 months (not 18, hallelujah), scenario sliders for ""what if users double but servers don't?"" and a cash flow dashboard that finally let me sleep without nightmares of overdraft fees. It wasn't some magic wand. I still had to grind on leads, but man, that emotional lift? Priceless. Went from ""am I even viable?"" and ""wtf am I even doing??"" dread to ""okay, this could actually scale"" quiet confidence. Retention ticked up because I could afford to iterate smarter, and yeah, MRR crossed $500 without selling my soul.

If you're in that same foggy spot, building like a champ but winging the numbers, give those templates a spin. They've got free starters too, perfect for testing the waters before committing.

This felt great getting off my chest. What's your biggest financial headache been lately? Spill in the comments, I'm sure we've all got hacks to swap. Also, if anyone knows of similar reliable templates and where to find them, please let me know!",1,1760468656.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

Foi o pior e melhor momento da minha vida.,"E aí, rapaziada. Tava fuçando aqui no Reddit e lembrei de uma fase da minha vida que foi tão intensa que as vezes parece que foi um sonho. Resolvi desabafar e compartilhar, porque acho que muita gente tem uma visão meio ""anime"" de se relacionar com alguém do Japão, e a realidade...bem, é bem mais complexa.

Tudo começou aqui mesmo, no Brasil. Eu trabalhava com TI em uma multinacional, e a empresa fez uma parceria com uma firma de Tóquio. Eles mandaram uma equipe para um projeto de alguns meses, e uma das engenheiras era a Yuki (nome fictício, por respeito).

A Yuki era diferente. Quieta, mas não tímida. Observadora. Quando ela falava, era sempre com uma precisão que cortava direto ao ponto. No início, foi estranho. Meus colegas e eu tentávamos puxar papo no coffee break, fazer aquelas piadas bestas, e ela só sorria educadamente, aquele sorriso fechado típico. Eu, teimoso, não desisti. Comecei a perguntar sobre o trabalho, e daí fui migrando para coisas mais pessoais, sempre com cuidado.

Descobri q ela amava jazz, coisa raríssima no círculo dela no Japão, e que tinha um senso de humor seco e sarcástico que eu nunca imaginei que uma japonesa teria (sim, eu cai no estereótipo). A gente começou a sair para ouvir jazz em uns bares underground, e foi ali que a conexão realmente aconteceu. Longe do ambiente corporativo, ela se soltava. Ficamos juntos pelos 6 meses que ela ficou no Brasil, e quando a data de volta dela se aproximou, a conversa era inevitável: ""E agora?"".

Decidimos tentar. Eu consegui um acordo para trabalhar remotamente e, depois de uma papelada infernal, comprei uma passagem só de ida para Tóquio.

Aterrissei em Narita num diazin abafado de julho. A Yuki me recebeu com a mesma serenidade de sempre, mas dava pra ver uma pontinha de ansiedade nos olhos dela. E eu? Eu estava em pânico.

A primeira semana foi uma overdose sensorial. Tudo era limpo, organizado, silencioso... mas ao mesmo tempo intensíssimo. As estações de metrô eram labirintos cheios de gente caminhando em filas perfeitas e em silêncio absoluto. Eu, um cara de 1,85m, me sentia um gigante desengonçado no meio daquelas multidões. O idioma era uma barreira física. Eu estudava japonês há alguns meses, mas era como checar no Duolingo e tentar decifrar o jornal no dia seguinte. A Yuki era minha salvação, mas também minha única tábua de salvação. A dependência começou ali.

Encontramos um apartamento minúsculo (cozinha americana que era basicamente um corredor) em um bairro residencial. Nos primeiros meses, foi uma lua de mel. Explorar Tóquio com ela era mágico. Ela me levava a izakayas (botecos japoneses) escondidos em becos, a templos no meio da cidade, me ensinava a etiqueta dos onsens (banhos termais). Eu me sentia o protagonista de um filme.

Mas a convivência diária começou a trazer à tona as diferenças que a gente ignorava na fase da paixão.

1. A Comunicação (ou a falta dela): A Yuki era a mestre do ""tatemae"" (a face pública, o que se espera que você diga) e eu, o brasileiro do ""honne"" (o que você realmente sente). Se algo a incomodava, ela não falava. Ela ficava quieta. Um silêncio que podia durar horas, ou um dia inteiro. Eu ficava locão, querendo ""resolver"" o problema, discutir, gritar se preciso fosse. Para ela, levantar a voz era a ultimate demonstração de falta de educação. Muitas das nossas ""brigas"" eram, na verdade, longos períodos de silêncio enlouquecedor, terminados com um ""está tudo bem"" que claramente não estava.
2. A Pressão Social: A família dela. Conheci os pais dela depois de 3 meses. Foi a reunião mais formal da minha vida. Fui treinado por dias pela Yuki sobre como me curvar, que presente dar, o que falar (ou não falar). Eles foram educadíssimos, mas dava pra sentir a desconfiança. A filha deles, uma engenheira de sucesso, trazendo um gaijin (estrangeiro) barulhento e emocional para a família. A Yuki, que era tão independente no Brasil, parecia uma pessoa diferente perto deles, mais contida, mais... ""japonesa"". A pressão para nos casarmos era sutil, mas constante.
3. A Solidão do Gaijin: Por mais que eu amasse a Yuki, ela tinha a vida dela: trabalho, amigas de infância, obrigações familiares. Nos fins de semana que ela passava com a família, eu ficava sozinho. Fazer amigos japoneses é difícil pra caramba. Eles são educados, mas raramente te deixam entrar no círculo íntimo. Eu frequentava um bar de um cara que falava um pouco de inglês, e era meu maior contato social fora da Yuki. A dependência emocional que eu tinha nela se tornou um peso para os dois.

Enfim, o relacionamento durou 2 anos no total. Terminou não com um estrondo, mas com um suspiro. Era visível que estávamos exaustos. Eu, de tentar me encaixar em uma caixa que era pequena demais para mim. Ela, de servir de ponte 24/7 entre eu e o mundo dela, e de lidar com as expectativas da família.

A conversa final foi a mais tranquila que já tivemos. Falamos sobre amor, sobre respeito, e sobre a realidade nua e crua de que às vezes o amor não é suficiente para preencher um abismo cultural tão grande. Não era sobre certo ou errado, era sobre ser diferente demais.

Voltei para o Brasil com o coração partido, mas com uma maturidade que não tinha antes. O Japão me ensinou resiliência, respeito (de verdade, não só da boca pra fora) e a valorizar a espontaneidade brasileira que a gente tanto critica.

Então, é isso. Foi incrível? Foi. Foi romântico? Em muitos momentos, sim, de um jeito que só um filme conseguiria capturar. Foi difícil? Para um caralho. Foi a experiência que mais me fez crescer como pessoa.

Se alguém aí está pensando em mergulhar de cabeça em um relacionamento assim, meu conselho é: vá. Mas vá com os olhos abertos. Aprenda o idioma. Entenda que você não está namorando apenas a pessoa, está namorando uma cultura inteira. E prepare o coração, pq pode doer.

Agora, fiquem à vontade para perguntar qualquer coisa. Desde as coisas mais íntimas até a burocracia para conseguir a visa.",156,1760468555.0,RelatosDoReddit,32,0.99,False

Dear ______,

It’s been a few weeks now but I still think about you every day. And maybe my feelings are disproportionately deep for the amount of time we had together, but I’m coming to terms with how my feelings grow and learning to embrace it. 

I had my first psychedelic experience a couple weeks ago and it felt like every bit of pain and grief that had ever lived in my body was laid bare, all rushing to the surface. I was alone and felt so scared. I’m sorry for texting you. I honestly thought I was going to die. 

I feel like I’ve had some more clarity recently. Maybe it’s a residual effect from the psychedelics or maybe it’s just time passing, but I’ve realized how much of my life I’ve been in survival mode. I spend so much time just trying to escape my mind that I am not really living. I have been moving through the world as if at some point a better life will land in my lap, when really this is the only one I have and it’s up to me to make it one I want to live. I’ve desperately wanted to sit with you over coffee and talk about this. 

As the weather cools down, my ache to be with you feels like it’s intensifying. I was so hopeful for the experiences we could have together. I was so looking forward to developing things with you. I wanted to make art together. I wanted to wake up next to you. I wanted to listen to you talk about your creative process. I wanted to share fall with you. 

I have this delusional hope that you’ll change your mind and come back. I keep hoping to get a text from you asking to talk. I keep recording voice notes that I know I won’t send. I keep thinking of kissing you and running my hands through your hair. I’m fine when I’m at work or when I’m with the kids. But when I’m alone it’s like you take up every spare inch of space in my mind. I wish knew how to let go. I didn’t know whether to tag this post as “lovers” or as “strangers”. Nothing seems to fit anymore. I just miss you.

I need to know if I'm insane or if everyone else has lost their minds.

So my husband owns a successful tech company. When we got married six years ago, we agreed I'd stay home. No kids yet, but the plan was eventually. I handled the house, did charity work, kept myself in shape. He worked constantly. That was our deal.

Three months ago he came home and said the company had a rough quarter. Nothing catastrophic but he wanted to cut back on expenses. He said my monthly allowance was going from eight thousand to four thousand until things stabilized.

I laughed. I actually thought he was joking.

He wasn't joking.

I told him four thousand was insulting. My gym membership alone is three hundred a month. My hair appointments, my facials, my trainer. I asked him if he expected me to look like his wife on a Walmart budget.

He said, ""Maybe you could get a part-time job. Just temporarily.""

I lost it. I told him I didn't sign up to be a working wife. That wasn't our arrangement. He knew who he married.

He got quiet. That should have been my first warning.

But I was so angry. I started going out more. Lunches with my friends. Longer gym sessions. And yeah, my trainer started paying me extra attention. He's twenty-six, gorgeous, always complimenting me.

Two weeks ago my husband asked me to sit down. He had spreadsheets. He showed me our actual finances. The company wasn't dying but it wasn't printing money like before. He said he needed me to be a partner, not a dependent.

I said, ""Maybe I don't want to be your partner anymore.""

He looked at me. Just stared.

I kept going. I said, ""You know what? I've met someone who actually appreciates me. Someone who doesn't make me feel like a burden.""

Total bluff. My trainer had flirted, sure, but nothing had happened.

My husband nodded slowly. He said, ""Okay.""

Just okay.

He slept in the guest room that night. The next morning he was gone before I woke up.

I figured he needed time to cool off. I went to the gym, got coffee with my friends, told them I'd finally stood up for myself. They were horrified but I felt powerful.

I came home that afternoon and his assistant was in my kitchen.

She's twenty-eight. Plain. Always wore boring blazers to company events.

She was unpacking groceries.

I said, ""What are you doing in my house?""

She turned around and smiled. Actually smiled at me.

She said, ""Your husband asked me to move in. We're getting married as soon as your divorce is finalized.""

I called him immediately. He answered on the first ring.

I said, ""What is she talking about?""

He said, ""You wanted out. I'm giving you out. My lawyer will contact you tomorrow. You can keep your car and your jewelry. Everything else stays.""

I started crying. I said it was just a fight. I didn't mean it.

He said, ""You meant it. I've known about your trainer for weeks. I had someone follow you.""

Nothing happened with my trainer. I swear. But the texts probably looked bad.

I said, ""Please. We can fix this.""

He said, ""I'm done fixing things for you.""

Then he hung up.

That was twelve days ago.

His assistant, his fiancée I guess, is living in my house. Sleeping in my bed. Using my kitchen.

I'm staying with my mom. She keeps asking what I expected. My dad won't even talk to me.

My friends have gone silent. Turns out most of them were friends with us as a couple, not with me specifically.

My trainer stopped responding to my texts the day after my husband called his gym and canceled my membership along with the personal training package. Apparently my husband had been paying for everything under a corporate account.

I got the divorce papers yesterday. I don't get alimony because I'm the one who said I wanted out. I have no job history. No references. I'm thirty-two years old and I have nothing.

My lawyer says I might get a small settlement but nothing like what I had.

I drove past our house two days ago. She was outside planting flowers in my garden. Wearing one of those cheap cotton dresses from Target. And my husband pulled up, got out of his car, and kissed her like he used to kiss me.

I wanted to make him panic. I wanted him to realize what he'd lose.

Instead he called my bluff in under twenty-four hours and replaced me with someone who probably thinks four thousand a month is generous.

My mom keeps saying I burned down my own life for pride.

**But was I really supposed to just accept being downgraded?**

It’s been a few weeks now but I still think about you every day. And maybe my feelings are disproportionately deep for the amount of time we had together, but I’m coming to terms with how my feelings grow and learning to embrace it. 

I had my first psychedelic experience a couple weeks ago and it felt like every bit of pain and grief that had ever lived in my body was laid bare, all rushing to the surface. I was alone and felt so scared. I’m sorry for texting you. I honestly thought I was going to die. 

I feel like I’ve had some more clarity recently. Maybe it’s a residual effect from the psychedelics or maybe it’s just time passing, but I’ve realized how much of my life I’ve been in survival mode. I spend so much time just trying to escape my mind that I am not really living. I have been moving through the world as if at some point a better life will land in my lap, when really this is the only one I have and it’s up to me to make it one I want to live. I’ve desperately wanted to sit with you over coffee and talk about this. 

As the weather cools down, my ache to be with you feels like it’s intensifying. I was so hopeful for the experiences we could have together. I was so looking forward to developing things with you. I wanted to make art together. I wanted to wake up next to you. I wanted to listen to you talk about your creative process. I wanted to share fall with you. 

I have this delusional hope that you’ll change your mind and come back. I keep hoping to get a text from you asking to talk. I keep recording voice notes that I know I won’t send. I keep thinking of kissing you and running my hands through your hair. I’m fine when I’m at work or when I’m with the kids. But when I’m alone it’s like you take up every spare inch of space in my mind. I wish knew how to let go. I didn’t know whether to tag this post as “lovers” or as “strangers”.

1o6odsy,https://i.redd.it/f8no4ee9k4vf1.jpeg,Sensitive Teeth but No Cavities — Why? | Dentist in Viman Nagar Explains,"You wake up, sip your morning coffee, and feel that sharp zing in your teeth — yet when you visit your **dentist near me**, they say there are **no cavities**. So, what’s going on? According to the experts at   [Team Dental](https://theteamdental.in/dentist-in-viman-nagar/), tooth sensitivity without visible decay is a common issue and often linked to enamel wear, gum recession, or even lifestyle habits.

# 1. Understanding Tooth Sensitivity

Tooth sensitivity occurs when the protective enamel layer on your teeth thins or when gums recede, exposing the dentin underneath. Dentin contains tiny tubules that connect to the tooth’s nerve. When hot, cold, sweet, or acidic foods reach these tubules, you feel discomfort or pain — even in the absence of cavities.

# 2. Common Causes of Sensitivity (Without Cavities)

1. **Enamel Erosion**
   * Caused by acidic foods, carbonated drinks, or frequent snacking.
   * Gradually wears down enamel, exposing the sensitive inner layers.
2. **Gum Recession**
   * Poor brushing habits or gum disease can pull gums away from the teeth, revealing root surfaces that are highly sensitive.
3. **Cracked or Worn Teeth**
   * Even tiny, invisible cracks can cause nerve irritation.
   * Often due to teeth grinding or chewing on hard objects.
4. **Overuse of Whitening Products**
   * Some whitening toothpastes or strips can weaken enamel and cause temporary sensitivity.
5. **Aggressive Brushing**
   * Brushing too hard or using a stiff-bristled toothbrush can damage enamel and gum tissue.
6. **Recent Dental Procedures**
   * Cleanings, fillings, or whitening treatments can temporarily increase sensitivity.

# 3. What You Can Do About It

1. **Switch to a Desensitizing Toothpaste** – These toothpastes block pain signals and strengthen enamel.
2. **Use a Soft-Bristled Brush** – Gentle brushing protects gums and enamel.
3. **Avoid Acidic and Sugary Foods** – Limit citrus fruits, sodas, and vinegar-based snacks.
4. **Stay Consistent with Dental Check-Ups** – A **dentist in Viman Nagar or Pune** can identify subtle causes before they worsen.
5. **Treat Underlying Gum Issues** – Early gum therapy can prevent root exposure.
6. **Consider Fluoride Treatments** – In-office fluoride varnishes or gels can strengthen weak enamel.

# 4. When to See a Dentist

If your sensitivity persists for more than two weeks, increases in intensity, or occurs even without temperature triggers, it’s time for a professional evaluation. In rare cases, nerve inflammation or small cracks in teeth can cause hidden issues that need immediate attention.

# 5. Final Thoughts

Having sensitive teeth doesn’t always mean you have cavities — but it’s a signal your teeth are asking for care. Simple changes in oral hygiene, diet, and brushing technique can make a big difference. The team at **Team Dental** emphasizes prevention: routine checkups, gentle care, and timely treatment can help you enjoy your favorite foods without that sudden jolt of pain.",1,1760468358.0,SmileBetterCommunity,0,1.0,False

1o6ocn2,https://i.redd.it/x0mypiomh4vf1.png,Mindful Eating: How Balanced Meals Can Soothe Stress,"# Introduction

What if the anxiety you’ve been battling isn’t just in your head — it’s also on your plate?

We often separate physical and mental health, but the truth is, your mind and body are in constant conversation. The food you eat sends messages to your brain that influence your mood, energy, and emotional balance. Avoiding processed foods and sugars helps prevent those blood sugar “highs and lows” that trigger anxiety and irritability — and this is more than theory. Research from **Harvard Health** and the **National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)** confirms that nutrition directly affects mental well-being.

While diet alone isn’t a substitute for therapy or medication — especially for severe depression or suicidal thoughts — it’s one of the most powerful tools you have to support your recovery and emotional balance.

At[ **NVelUp**](https://nvelup.care/), we’ve seen firsthand how addressing nutrition alongside[ therapy](https://nvelup.care/services/therapy/), psychiatry, and naturopathy transforms outcomes. Whether you’re managing **anxiety, panic attacks, ADHD, depression, or mood disorders**, every food choice you make either nourishes your brain or strains it.

This isn’t about restriction or guilt — it’s about fueling your mind with what it needs to thrive. Let’s explore the fascinating connection between food and mood, and how mindful eating can help you find calm, clarity, and control.





# The Science Behind Food and Mood: What Research Really Shows

# The Blood Sugar–Anxiety Connection

Your brain is an energy powerhouse — it uses about 20% of your body’s glucose supply even though it’s only 2% of your weight. When you eat foods high in sugar or refined carbs, your blood sugar spikes, giving you a short-lived energy rush. Soon after, your body releases insulin to lower that sugar — often overshooting the mark, causing a sudden crash.

That crash can lead to symptoms that mirror anxiety:

* Rapid heartbeat
* Shakiness or dizziness
* Irritability or brain fog
* Sudden mood swings

For people already prone to anxiety, these blood sugar dips can **trigger panic-like responses**, activating your body’s stress hormones (cortisol and adrenaline) and worsening anxious sensations.

# Sugar and Depression: The Hidden Connection

A 2023 analysis from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey** found that every **100 g/day increase in sugar** was linked to a **28% higher prevalence of depression**. Similarly, consuming sugary drinks was associated with **31% higher odds of depression**, according to CDC research.

Why? Because sugar isn’t just empty calories — it alters your brain chemistry.

* **Inflammation:** High sugar diets keep your body’s immune system “on alert,” releasing inflammatory chemicals linked to depression.
* **Neurotransmitter disruption:** Sugar temporarily boosts dopamine but depletes your brain’s ability to regulate mood long-term.
* **Gut-brain imbalance:** About 90% of serotonin — your “feel good” chemical — is made in the gut. A diet high in sugar harms healthy gut bacteria that influence serotonin production.





# The Mediterranean Diet Advantage

One of the most well-researched diets for mental health is the **Mediterranean diet** — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fish. Studies show it reduces the risk of developing depressive symptoms by up to **33%**.

What makes it effective:

* Steady blood sugar from complex carbs
* Omega-3 fats from fish and nuts
* Antioxidants that reduce brain inflammation
* Nutrients that support neurotransmitter balance

You don’t need to strictly follow any single plan — just **move away from processed foods** and toward real, whole ingredients. Each small change you make adds up to a calmer, clearer mind.





# Understanding Mindful Eating: More Than Just What You Eat

Mindful eating combines two ideas: *what* you eat and *how* you eat.  
It’s about slowing down, savoring your food, and reconnecting with your body’s natural hunger and satisfaction cues.

# What Mindful Eating Means

* Eat when you’re hungry, stop when you’re satisfied.
* Notice how food makes you feel — not just in your body but emotionally.
* Avoid multitasking — no scrolling, emails, or TV while eating.
* Appreciate flavors, colors, and textures.
* Recognize emotional vs. physical hunger.

For anxiety, this approach is grounding — it brings you into the present moment and out of racing thoughts. For depression, it helps reconnect you to the sensory experience of nourishment.





# The “What” of Mindful Eating: Foods That Soothe Stress

# Brain-Supporting Food Categories

1. **Vegetables and Fruits** Eat the rainbow — each color offers unique antioxidants that fight inflammation and protect your brain. Dark leafy greens like spinach and kale are rich in **folate**, vital for serotonin production.
2. **Whole Grains** Choose oats, quinoa, brown rice, or barley. Complex carbs release glucose slowly, keeping energy and mood stable while promoting serotonin synthesis.
3. **Lean Proteins** Include eggs, fish, poultry, beans, and tofu. Protein provides amino acids that your brain uses to build neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin.
4. **Healthy Fats** Your brain is nearly 60% fat. Focus on **omega-3s** from salmon, walnuts, chia, and flaxseeds. Use olive oil for cooking.
5. **Fermented Foods** Yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut feed healthy gut bacteria, improving digestion and mood regulation.
6. **Hydration** Even mild dehydration can cause fatigue and anxiety. Drink **half your body weight in ounces of water daily**. Add herbal teas for relaxation.





# The “How” of Mindful Eating: Practical Strategies

Mindful eating isn’t complicated — it’s about slowing down and being intentional.

* **Eat slowly:** Give your brain time (about 20 minutes) to sense fullness.
* **Eliminate distractions:** Focus on the act of eating — your brain digests better when relaxed.
* **Engage your senses:** Smell, taste, texture, and even the sound of chewing can ground you.
* **Check in with your body:** Ask, “How hungry am I? How do I feel after eating this?”
* **Express gratitude:** Take a brief pause before eating to thank your body and the source of your food.

This process shifts eating from automatic to intentional — calming your nervous system and restoring balance.





# Foods to Reduce: The Anxiety-Stress Connection

# Refined Sugars & Carbs

Skip the “blood sugar rollercoaster.” Replace sweets, pastries, and soda with fruit, yogurt, and whole grains.

# Caffeine

Caffeine can increase jitters and heart rate. If you notice restlessness or panic after coffee, try switching to herbal tea or decaf gradually.

# Alcohol

While it may seem relaxing, alcohol disrupts sleep, mood, and medication effectiveness. Long-term, it worsens anxiety and depression.

# Ultra-Processed Foods

Fast food, packaged snacks, and frozen meals are linked to higher rates of depression due to their inflammatory effects. Choose whole, home-cooked meals whenever possible.





# Building Your Stress-Soothing Meal Plan

Here’s how to build meals that steady your energy and mood:

# Breakfast: Ground Your Morning

* **Oatmeal with berries and walnuts** — steady energy and omega-3s
* **Eggs with spinach and avocado toast** — protein, folate, and healthy fats
* **Greek yogurt with banana and flaxseed** — probiotics and mood-boosting nutrients

# Lunch: Maintain Balance

* **Quinoa bowl with chickpeas, veggies, and tahini**
* **Salmon salad with greens and olive oil**
* **Turkey wrap with hummus and veggies**

# Dinner: Calm and Restore

* **Grilled fish, sweet potatoes, and broccoli**
* **Tofu or chicken stir-fry with brown rice**
* **Whole grain pasta with tomato sauce and grilled chicken**

# Snacks: Nourish, Don’t Numb

* Nuts and seeds
* Veggies with hummus
* Fruit with almond butter
* Dark chocolate (70% cacao or higher) in moderation





# Special Considerations: Nutrition for Specific Conditions

# Anxiety & Panic Disorders

* **Eat every 4–5 hours** to prevent blood sugar drops.
* Include magnesium-rich foods (greens, nuts, seeds).
* Reduce caffeine and sugar.

# Depression & Mood Disorders

* Prioritize **omega-3s**, **folate**, and **vitamin D**.
* Eat protein at each meal to support neurotransmitter production.
* Address appetite loss with small, nutrient-dense meals or smoothies.

# ADHD

* Eat regular meals to stabilize focus and prevent crashes.
* Include **protein + complex carbs** in every meal.
* Limit sugar and processed foods that worsen impulsivity.

# PTSD & Trauma

* Trauma can affect digestion and appetite.
* Practice gentle, mindful eating and avoid strict food rules.
* Focus on nourishment, not restriction.

# Bipolar Disorder

* Maintain consistent meal times to support circadian rhythm.
* Limit caffeine and alcohol.
* Omega-3s can help mood stabilization.





# Overcoming Barriers to Healthy Eating

# “I Don’t Have Time to Cook”

* Batch cook or prep once a week.
* Use pre-cut veggies or frozen fruits.
* Keep simple staples: eggs, canned beans, oats.

# “Healthy Food Is Too Expensive”

* Buy frozen or bulk items.
* Use inexpensive proteins like beans, eggs, or lentils.
* Compare costs — fast food adds up more than you think.

# “I Eat When I’m Stressed”

* Identify triggers (boredom, anxiety, loneliness).
* Use alternative coping tools: breathing, calling a friend, walking.
* Keep nourishing snacks accessible.

# “I Have No Appetite”

* Eat small, frequent meals.
* Try smoothies or soups.
* Eat with others for stimulation.





# The Holistic Approach: Integrating Nutrition with Mental Health Care

At[ **NVelUp**](https://nvelup.care/), we treat nutrition as one piece of the mental health puzzle — working hand-in-hand with[ therapy](https://nvelup.care/services/therapy/), psychiatry, and holistic care.

* **Nutrition +**[ **Therapy**](https://nvelup.care/services/therapy/)**:** Identify emotional triggers for eating and build healthy habits.
* **Nutrition + Medication:** Support brain chemistry and offset medication side effects.
* **Nutrition +**[ **Naturopathy**](https://nvelup.care/services/naturopathy-2/)**:** Correct deficiencies and improve gut health naturally.
* **Nutrition + Fitness:** Align energy levels, exercise, and meal timing for mental resilience.





# Your Mindful Eating Action Plan

**Week 1 – Awareness**  
Track your meals and how they make you feel. Practice mindful eating once daily.

**Weeks 2–3 – Additions**  
Add vegetables, protein with breakfast, and extra hydration.

**Weeks 4–6 – Reductions**  
Reduce sugar, caffeine, and processed foods. Replace with real, whole ingredients.

**Ongoing – Refinement**  
Celebrate progress, not perfection. Adjust based on your body’s feedback.





# When to Seek Professional Support

While nutrition is powerful, it’s not a cure-all. Reach out to a mental health professional if:

* Anxiety or depression interferes with daily life.
* You have thoughts of self-harm or suicide.
* You use food, alcohol, or substances to cope.
* Emotional eating or restriction feels uncontrollable.

At[ **NVelUp**](https://nvelup.care/), our integrated team provides:

* Psychiatry &[ medication management](https://nvelup.care/services/medication-management/)
* [Therapy](https://nvelup.care/services/therapy/) and CBT
* Nutrition and lifestyle coaching
* [Naturopathy](https://nvelup.care/services/naturopathy-2/) & fitness-based wellness programs





# Conclusion: Feeding Your Mental Health, One Meal at a Time

You can’t control every stressor — but you can control how you nourish your body.  
Every mindful meal you eat helps balance your brain chemistry, reduce anxiety, and build emotional resilience.

The goal isn’t perfection — it’s awareness, compassion, and progress. Some days you’ll make choices that lift your mood; other days, you’ll comfort yourself with ice cream — and that’s okay.

Food is one of your most accessible tools for self-care.  
When you combine mindful eating with[ therapy](https://nvelup.care/services/therapy/), medication, and holistic care, you create a foundation for lasting mental wellness.

I’m a mom to a 6-year-old boy on the spectrum who was in a mild-to-moderate social cognition class. We recently moved from a large SoCal district to a smaller NorCal one, and the difference in communication has been huge.

In our old district, staff reached out before school started, shared updates, and helped us understand routines. Here, I’ve had to initiate every bit of communication, even for basic things like who my child’s providers are or what the daily schedule looks like. Even program terms like “mild/moderate” or “social cognition” are unclear, and there’s almost no parent info online.

Everyone is polite when I reach out, but the system feels passive instead of proactive. I’ve gone to the district’s “coffee and chat” events and board meetings, but everything is still “a work in progress.”

Has anyone else felt this kind of drop after moving districts? How do you advocate or get clarity without burning out? The goal is to get an idea of how my son is transitioning (it's a big move) as his friday folder barely has any classwork in it, and there's no proactive updates from his teacher. He's coming from the total opposite, classwork almost every other day in a daily folder (that provided a sticker snapshot of how the day went which paras helped fill). I'm pretty bummed as I feel like I'm navigating in the dark and have no clue how my son is doing. He's not fully verbal (nor a reliable source of the day's event) at 6 w/ a speech delay and as a GLP.

1o6o9y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnderReportedNews/comments/1o6o9y7/starbuckss_uk_retail_business_paid_no_corporation/,Starbucks’s UK retail business paid no corporation tax last year,"Starbucks’s UK retail business paid no corporation tax for last year as it dived to a £35m loss after paying £40m in royalty and licence fees to its parent company.

The US-owned coffee chain said it made the payments despite sales declining 4% to £525.6m in the year to 29 September 2024, amid what it called a “challenging economic climate” and a consumer boycott linked to the Gaza conflict.

Sales fell even though it opened 100 new British stores during the period. The previous year it had made a £16.9m pre-tax profit.

The company’s trading was hit after it was named on a list of companies to boycott for its perceived support for, investment in, or links to, Israel. It has denied having any political agenda, saying: “We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere.”

In spite of sliding sales, Starbucks’s UK retail arm paid out just over £40m in royalty and licence fees to its parent company – a similar figure to the prior year – tipping it into loss so that it paid no corporation tax.

It did hand HM Revenue and Customs almost £1m in deferred payments and adjustments related to prior years – including £455,000 of corporation tax. That came after it was previously criticised by fair tax campaigners for paying a “derisorily low” £7.2m in UK corporation tax for 2023.

Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, described the catch-up payments as “paltry”, adding that the latest Starbucks UK accounts reflected a long history of paying little or no corporate income tax with “surpluses invariably wiped out by substantial royalty payments to other parts of the business”.

Starbucks paid just £8.6m in the first 14 years after its 1998 debut in the UK, with none paid in several consecutive years, despite £3bn worth of sales during that time.

A Starbucks spokesperson said:“Starbucks is in full compliance with tax laws around the world, with an effective global tax rate of over 24% in 2024, which is in excess of the 15% minimum corporation tax discussed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.”

The number of transactions at Starbucks’s 1,240 UK outlets, which include 378 run directly by the company as well as hundreds operated by franchisees, fell back as it raised prices by up to 4% on its drinks, amid inflation on coffee beans, cocoa and milk. The price of a latte or cappuccino hit £4.25 in March last year, with more elaborate drinks, such as a white chocolate mocha, reaching £5.40.

This month prices have risen again, with a cappuccino now costing £4.70 and a caramel macchiato priced at £6.10.

As the company fell into the red, Starbucks’s parent company pumped £50m into its UK division last year – via a revolving credit facility and a capital injection. Late last year the parent group committed to support its UK arm further financially if necessary and extended the payback period for a £20m loan, on which it is charging its UK business more than 5% interest, until December this year.
“Persistent inflation and higher interest rates left consumers with less disposable income, resulting in many adjusting usual spending habits; leading to a reduction in year-on-year transactions,” Starbucks said in accounts filed at Companies House this week.

This was coupled with an increasingly competitive environment in key cities as new entrants to the market invested in new stores. Misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East also affected footfall in some locations in the first half of the year.”

The company, which was founded in Seattle in 1971 and is now the world’s biggest coffee shop operator, said there was also increasing competition for the best sites in city centres and drive-thrus, despite coffee shops coming under pressure from cost inflation and tightened consumer spending.

While Starbucks’s UK business has struggled, its cheaper rival Greggs has been rapidly expanding, while the British chain Caffè Nero increased sales globally by 15% in the year to May 2024 to almost £520m, including 10% growth in the UK. However, Caffè Nero also fell into the red, recording a £34.4m annual loss.

Starbucks has said it wants to open 80 more stores this year.

1o6o4tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/1o6o4tf/room_available_in_bushwick/,Room Available in Bushwick,"Hello! My roommate and I are **looking for a third roommate** to take over our current third roommate's room starting on November 1 for a **nine-month lease**. We live on Jefferson Street off of Myrtle-Broadway, between Broadway and Bushwick Avenue. Pictures and video at bottom of post!

About Us:

Our current third roommate is moving out of the country, so we need a replacement! You would be living with two males, both of us 26 years old. We really value cleanliness, and in general like to keep a pretty peaceful vibe in the apartment. You would be sharing a bathroom with just me—roommate #2 has a bathroom attached to his bedroom (he pays the most in rent). I work in film and education whereas roommate #2 works in software and does some film stuff on the side. I am sober and while it doesn't matter to me if you are, I'd prefer not to live with someone who is in active addiction. I am more of an introvert and keep to myself whereas roommate #2 is a bit more outgoing, though he is a night owl and travels a fair bit so he is probably less of a consistent presence around the apartment during the day.

About The Apartment:

Three bedroom, two bath apartment located on Jefferson Street off the Myrtle-Broadway subway stop.

Your room will be $1375/month, and is large enough to fit a full or queen bed, a desk and a dresser. As far as room sizes go it is decent or even on the larger side. I think it is about 14' by 11'. There is a TV mount in the wall if you'd like to utilize that, and roommate #3 is selling all of her furniture to whoever moves in. You would live in the back of the apartment so there's no need to worry about street noise.

Pros:

* Washer/dryer in unit!
* Lots of natural sunlight on both sides of the apartment.
* Steps away from the JMZ, 12 minute walk to the L, 18 minute walk to the G. It takes 15 minutes to get from Myrtle-Broadway into downtown Manhattan on the J. Easy subway or bike access to Ridgewood, Bed-Stuy, and Williamsburg.
* Terrific landlords! This is a 3 family home. We live on the second floor, and the landlords are a nice family that live in the 1st floor and basement. They are super kind and extremely responsive if there's ever an issue, though there rarely is an issue. Sometimes they even give us food if they've cooked too much. The apartment was fully renovated 3.5 years ago before I moved in, and all of the infrastructure and amenities work nicely.
* There is an AC in your room already.
* Great food and nightlife nearby.
* Food Bazaar grocery store one block away.
* CitiBike station one block away.
* Coffee shop (Concrete Jungle), Mexican restaurant (La Lupe), and small bar (Rebecca's) all on our block! Hank's Bar is also at the end of the block and Birdy's is not far away either.

Cons:

* We live right off of the Myrtle-Broadway intersection, which means there are a decent amount of homeless people nearby. In my 3.5 years at this apartment, I've never seen them bother anyone (aside from occasionally asking for spare change), but if walking by destitute, strung out people on a daily basis is too depressing, scary, or triggering for you, this isn't the spot for you. Our current third roommate is a girl and has mentioned being catcalled down by Broadway fairly consistently but it hasn't gone further than that.
* In general, the street has a fair amount of trash and rats. It's not aesthetically pleasing but otherwise hasn't been much of an issue—though I do have to do specific things to protect my car from rats nesting in the engine bay.

Utilities include Wi-Fi, Gas, and Electric and total about $90-$150 each per month.

If you're interested, please send me a message and we can set up a video call between you, roommate #2, and myself to see if our living styles would make for a good fit!

# 1. Strong Wi-Fi and Seamless Connectivity

Ask any digital nomad their top priority, and they’ll say it without hesitation — **Wi-Fi that doesn’t drop during a video call.**  
 A remote-friendly vacation rental begins with fast, reliable internet. Mentioning your **Mbps speed** in your listing instantly builds trust.

Smart hosts take it further — adding Wi-Fi boosters or even backup connections to ensure guests can stay online, whether they’re working from the patio or the living room.  
 On Llivo, hosts can label their homes as *Work-Ready Stays*, helping travelers find the spaces that keep them connected — not frustrated.



# 2. A Workspace That Inspires, Not Tires

Remote work isn’t just about having a desk — it’s about having the *right energy.*  
 Think natural light, ergonomic chairs, soft textures, and views that spark creativity. Many **Llivo hosts** add thoughtful touches — a corner plant, soft lamp lighting, or a dedicated “focus zone” where guests can unwind into work mode.

“I love when a home feels like it was made for me,” says a Llivo guest from Austin. “Good Wi-Fi is great, but a space that inspires me to work — that’s luxury.”  
 For design inspiration and hosting stories, explore the[ Story of Llivo](https://www.llivo.com/p/about).



# 3. Comfort That Encourages Focus and Rest

When you work remotely, *comfort equals productivity.* A high-end stay should help guests shift easily between Zoom calls and downtime.  
 From cozy reading chairs to blackout curtains and good lighting, little details matter.

That’s what makes **Llivo’s transport-inclusive model** so special — it adds convenience from the moment a guest lands. Airport pickups aren’t just a ride; they’re the first act of hospitality. Guests arrive relaxed, ready to work — not weary from travel.

Find more inspiration on creating balanced, work-friendly listings in Llivo’s Travel Wellness and Hosting Excellence.



# 4. Lifestyle, Community, and Local Connection

Even the most independent digital nomad needs a sense of belonging.  
 Remote work can get lonely, and the best hosts understand this. A quick message, a guide to local cafés, or a tip on where to find strong coffee and good Wi-Fi — those gestures turn a guest into a friend.

**Llivo** encourages hosts to share *authentic local insights* — nearby coworking hubs, yoga studios, or weekend markets. These details transform a short-term rental into a genuine home for travelers who work on the move.

# 5. FAQs for Remote Work Travelers and Hosts

**Q1: What makes a vacation rental ideal for remote workers?**  
 A: The best rentals combine reliable Wi-Fi, quiet surroundings, ergonomic furniture, and a friendly, responsive host. Add-ons like **airport pickup services** or local coworking tips give your listing a professional edge.

1o6o0ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/Imperial/comments/1o6o0ho/negative_imperial_experience/,Negative Imperial Experience,"I am not actively trying to dissuade, but Imperial is creating a brand and marketing it very well, nigh on coercively, and I see many people here applying, so I am going to share my personal negative experience of Imperial and why if I could go back 4 years I personally would not choose an Imperial MEng degree again. 



First and foremost, the location in London. There is a lot to do in London, if you have the time and money, which you almost certainly will not. Rent alone will cost your both your kidneys, and the countless homeless people and beggars will serve as a gentle glimpse into your future or maybe a reminder of your own financial instability. But that's not too bad, because the economic inequality is even more apparent within the grounds of campus. International students, oh boy where do I start. You'll spend the weekend working out if you can afford to eat next week and developing an eating disorder, while they're jetting off to Vienna for a lovely time at the coffee house. While you're both supposed to be working on some nonsensically complicated coursework.



Most internationals are great, but this is more than made up for by the few that aren't. A melting pot society only works if people choose to be malleable, and let me tell you, these rich, narcissistic, egoistic assholes could not care less about society as long as they stay on the pedestals built by their parents. They paid their way into this degree, with worse results, and sometimes can't even speak English very well. But where those few internationals really shine, is sexual harassment. There was at least one incident every year, ranging from creepy comments, to groping and even rape. It was, and I'm sure still is, a horrible environment. Racism was also rife to my understanding, mainly between internationals and their naturalised counterparts.



The academic work is itself quite interesting, and highly challenging, which I actually enjoyed, becoming a kind of escape from the awful environment. However, it is extremely draining, and many of my groupmates were inept and or lazy, leading to a massive workload disparity that further drained my already crumbling mental health. It felt incredibly exploitative, carrying other students to do well, being manipulated and having my kindness abused by other students, all the while the university offered no useful support and ghosted most pleas. The lectures were pretty useless, because the content is simply too difficult to understand in a big theatre, surrounded by other puzzled faces, being ranted at in a heavy accent at the speed of light. You will have to study and understand the content on your own and it will take a lot of time, I would only recommend going to lectures to complain about them with your course mates.



After all the hand-holding in first year, there is very little help within the university even though the workload gets significantly harder, and a great level of independence is required. The main form of pastoral support is supposed to be a tutor, but while I was there their only job seemed to be to tell us our grades in front of the other classmates in our tutor group, to further remind us our academic success is our sole responsibility and reinforce the stupidly high standards at Imperial. There was some degree of irresponsibility or even corruption, where some students are close enough to lecturers to have their number, and even be told how they did in exams in advance of everybody else. I was also exposed to another form of pastoral support in the form of a counsellor for the course, but they were untrained and told me things about other students that I shouldn't know, and they only served to make things significantly worse.



The careers service in my experience was quite bad, but who can blame them in the current economic climate. Everything was mostly focused around finance, which was useless for a wannabe engineer. The worst part is that the workload was too heavy and stressful to put decent applications together, particularly when having to carry other students, so most fell short, and in engineering most companies seem to want years in industry, but I just wanted to get university over with so badly that I didn't even consider it.



And after graduating, the degree itself seems to be worthless (Even with a high 1st class), it holds little clout or recognition and people think I breezed through, just drinking with my mates and solving everything with ChatGPT. Believe me, I did not, university changed me; I stopped drinking, deleted social media, probably picked up a few mental disorders, and further deepened my sense of nihilism for the future to an extent I would have never previously imagined. I pray graduation was the last time I have to interact with this hellhole of a university, and I cannot express enough how much I could never recommend it to anyone.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **New Mexico State Aggies vs. Liberty Flames: A Clash of Cactus and Circus**

The New Mexico State Aggies (3-2) and Liberty Flames (2-4) are set to collide in a Conference USA slugfest that promises more drama than a reality TV show about a football team. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game is basically a math problem with a sideline of chaos.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

Liberty is a **10.5-point favorite**, per the latest lines, with the over/under set at **46.5 points**. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates games 10,000 times while sipping coffee and muttering about “randomness,” predicts **58 combined points** and backs one side with a **60% hit rate**. That’s not just a hunch—it’s the sports equivalent of a mathematician betting your lunch money.

**Key stats to chew on:**

* **New Mexico State’s offense**: A walking (or rather, *limping*) joke. The Aggies rank **last nationally in rushing** (50.6 yards per game, 1.86 YPA) and their QB, **Logan Fife**, is the worst-graded passer under pressure (29.5 PFF). Their offensive line? A sieve that would make a leaky colander blush.
* **Liberty’s defense**: Fresh off a game where they sacked UTEP’s QB more than they had in their previous **four games combined**. Transfer **Joe Strickland** and nose tackle **Bryce Dixon** are the wrecking crew, and their pass rush should make Fife feel like he’s being grilled by the NCAA compliance office.
* **Liberty’s offense**: QB **Ethan Vasko** isn’t lighting the world on fire (0 TDs in his last game), but he’s a solid 1,006-yard passer with 6 TDs. The Flames also have **Jamari Person**, a Colorado State transfer who’s caught 16 passes for 187 yards—think of him as the team’s emotional support receiver.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Strategy, and Metaphors

* **New Mexico State**: Their defense is decent (10 takeaways, 22.8 PPG allowed), but their offense? It’s like a toaster that only pops half the bread. QB Logan Fife’s struggles under pressure are the Aggies’ version of a ticking time bomb. Coach Tony Sanchez has improved the team from last year, but road games? They’re 0-2, which is about as reliable as a weather forecast in the deser

“We’re in New York City! First time ever!” bellows Crazy Alan. “I’m here to sell, you’re here to buy!”

It’s 10:14 a.m. on Saturday morning, and the inaugural [Empire State Pen Show](https://espenshow.com/) is just getting started. Dozens of people who lined up early have filed into the Rhinelander ballroom on the New York Hilton Midtown’s second floor and are hunched over tables of fountain pens, ink bottles, notebooks and other stationery items.

Alan Cohen—or Crazy Alan, as his business cards and the hand-drawn sign on his table call him—is already haggling with shoppers. Prominently advertised: the Pilot Emperor, an [urushi-lacquered](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-30/how-nakaya-pens-anticipated-the-writing-tool-renaissance) fountain pen that retails for some $2,500.

Annual pen shows, where aficionados can buy, sell and trade such luxury writing instruments, can be found in every big city in the US, along with many [smaller ones](https://www.arpenshow.com/). Except New York—until this past weekend. The Empire State Pen Show replaces a more modest event once held at Hofstra University, out on Long Island.

The new show isn’t merely a welcome addition for pen collectors in New York, 1,200 of whom paid $20 to $25 in advance to attend the little-advertised event for a day, with more tickets sold at the door. It also marks a handover to a new generation at a time when the hobby is seeing dramatic changes. Worldwide, fountain pen sales are forecast to total $1.2 billion this year, a decline of 1% from 2024 and down 17% from a decade ago, according to market-research company Euromonitor International.

Older collectors, who have different tastes and aren’t as driven by internet trends, are a shrinking market. With this new customer base coming in—one that’s very, very online—the hope among sellers is to replenish the ranks.

Pen shows used to be dominated by retirees whose hobby is restoring vintage writing instruments made by Parker, Sheaffer, Waterman and other American brands that were household names in the 1920s, ’30s and ’40s—before the invention of the ballpoint pen threatened the fountain pen with obsolescence. Attendees would joke about the old men in fishing vests, which have plentiful pockets for easy access to pens, tools and jeweler’s loupes.

A member of that generation of enthusiasts—Michael Bloom, 78, a retired schoolteacher—ran the Hofstra show with his wife, but health issues eventually sidelined her. Managing the show solo was too arduous, he says. “Then I gave it to Frank.”

Frank is 26-year-old Frank Zhang, a wunderkind in the pen world. (Asked at the show where Zhang is, one worker suggests looking for the man in the black suit with “that Frank energy.”) Zhang started his first [pen company](https://nahvalur.com/) at 19 and is in his third year running the [California Pen Show](https://www.capenshow.com/), held near Los Angeles each February. The Shanghai native is closer in age and interests to younger hobbyists, and sells attention-getting pens in materials such as ebonite and [bright-colored resins](https://nahvalur.com/collections/nahvalur-schuylkill/products/schuylkill-breast-cancer-awareness-2024-fountain-pen) ($89) and some with piston fillers.

“New people are getting into this,” he says, noting a couple of twentysomethings bent over a nearby table.

While the Manhattan show still features plenty of vintage pens, even more tables are filled with planners and journals, Japanese washi tape used to decorate notebooks, custom pens made of multihued resins that sparkle under the light, and stickers of cartoon cats, cupcakes and coffee cups. And the standard Parker, Sheaffer and Waterman blue, black and blue-black inks have given way to newcomers such as [Ferris Wheel Press](https://ferriswheelpress.com/), which makes colors (from $22 for 20 milliliters) including Currant Crumble Pie, Gossiping Grapevine and Lost in the Leaves.

“This show’s entirely different—I don’t know half these people here,” says Paul Erano, 76, a vendor for decades who attends about a dozen pen shows annually. Sixteen years ago, he founded the [Black Pen Society](http://www.paulspens.com/the-black-pen-society.html), a not-so-secret club with one qualification for membership: an affection for simple, old-fashioned black pens, the type used by bankers, lawyers and pretty much everyone else before tastes shifted toward the more colorful.

Erano welcomes the changes the Empire State Pen Show and similarly dynamic events in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas are bringing to the hobby. The LA show sold about 3,500 tickets this year, according to Zhang.

“We’ll call it a new generation. They’re into inks, paper, journaling, stationery. There’s just a few vintage dealers,” he says, gesturing to tables similar to his nearby. Yet even the Black Pen Society’s Grand Poobah—Erano’s official title—can’t help but give his blessing to the wild multicolored resins created by the modern [Carolina Pen Co.](https://www.carolinapencompany.com/about)’s Jonathon Brooks, piled on the penmaker’s table nearby. “He’s good.”

Brooks, 43, makes resin rods, used for pen barrels and caps, for big brands such as Esterbrook, Delta, Visconti and Stipula, as well as for one-man shops and his own custom pens, which sell for upwards of $200. He’s witnessed the significant shift in the hobby since joining the pen-show circuit 11 years ago.

“Back then, it was very difficult to describe what a custom pen was,” Brooks says. “Now it’s a gravitational pull for a lot of people.”

While the newer stationery items remain analog products, their popularity is driven by tech. On Instagram and other social media sites, collectors show off their [Bullet Journals](https://bulletjournal.com/) and Hobonichi planners, with pages covered in a rainbow of ink colors, stickers and washi tape, alongside eye-catching—and often pricey—fountain pens.

It was on Reddit that Nneka Edwards’ sister, Naomi, learned about the Empire State Pen Show, but she lives in Pittsburgh and couldn’t attend herself, so she sent the 20-year-old down from the Bronx to look for ink samples. While at the show, Edwards attended a “Fountain Pen Basics” seminar, walking away with two inexpensive starter pens. Even though she used fountain pens in middle school while growing up in Trinidad, Edwards fears her writing style might be too aggressive for their nibs.

“I’m very heavy-handed,” she says. “I don’t think I should make a poor pen suffer again.”",42,1760467028.0,fountainpens,5,1.0,False

1o6nqcb,https://i.redd.it/7ja4tsetf4vf1.jpeg,Starbucks tells corporate staff in US and Canada to work in office at least four days a week,"
Starbucks has ordered its corporate staff to work from the office at least four days a week from late September and is offering cash payments to those who choose to quit instead.

Brian Niccol, the chief executive of the Seattle-headquartered coffee chain, said many of its employees would be required to work in the office for a minimum of four days a week, up from three, from Monday to Thursday.

The edict will apply to its Seattle and Toronto support centres and its regional offices in North America. The change does not apply to the UK, where Starbucks has its head office in Chiswick, west London.

“We do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said in a message to employees, referred to as “partners”, on the company’s website about “re-establishing an in-office culture”. “We want leaders and people managers to be physically present with their teams.”

He added: “Being in-person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, including coffee roasters and warehouse staff. It employs about 360,000 people worldwide, including 5,600 in the UK, most of whom work in its cafes.

The four-day office policy will come into effect on 29 September. Niccol, who has been in the job for almost a year, has said he wants to take Starbucks back to its coffeehouse roots by improving customers’ experience in its cafes and reducing reliance on mobile and takeaway orders.

He said: “We know we’re asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone.

“To support those who decide to ‘opt out’, we’re offering a one-time voluntary exit programme with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.” The company did not state the size of the sum.

A string of businesses in the US and the UK – such as Amazon and HSBC – have ordered their staff back to the office for the majority of the working week. On Tuesday, a survey showed that a fear of having to return to their office desks is having an impact on workers’ wellbeing.

In February, Starbucks asked its vice-presidents who were working remotely to move to Seattle or Toronto. It is now extending this requirement to all support centre “people leaders”, who are expected to relocate within 12 months.

In its previous announcement, Starbucks set out plans to lay off 1,100 corporate employees and close several hundred open or vacant job positions, the biggest job cuts in its history, in order to reduce costs as it struggled with rising inflation and economic uncertainty.

Niccol faced environmental criticism last year for his 1,000-mile commute to work in the office three days a week. The company allowed him to travel in from his home in Newport Beach, California, to its head office in Seattle via a private jet instead of relocating. Since then, he has bought a home in Seattle and is frequently seen at the company’s headquarters, a spokesperson told Associated Press.",0,1760466856.0,UnderReportedNews,0,0.5,False

I am definitely a creature of habit and once I've found my little routine/ritual I stick with it for ages. It's comforting. 

My current routine is to wake up, feed the cats, take my meds, make coffee. And at night, it's feed the cats, take my meds and make dinner. Over time the cats (and I) have become very used to this little ritual. 

Tonight, I went to a late evening workout class and completely missed my reminder for my meds, got home did my thing, got ready for bed totally forgetting to take my meds. 

My cat then proceeds to scream at me like a wounded animal because I haven't fed him, and like Pavlov's dog, I remembered to take my medicine. 

TLDR; if you never want to forget a dose again, get a cat. ",2,1760466827.0,bipolar2,1,1.0,False

My partner and I are looking for future retirement plot/home to move to and then retire in the next few years. I come from the hot and dry area of the country and really want to swap the catbox view to a lush green mountainous area that you currently enjoy. We have visited the area a bit and I've spent countless hours on Google maps and real estate websites. We are thinking of a quiet suburban neighborhood, but not so remote that it takes 30+ mins just to get to a basic market.

I want to come and spend a few weeks in the area possibly bribing locals with coffee or drinks to get their opinions of the area. Before I do that, maybe I can get the Reddit POV of the area?

Is the broadband access good? Any fiber companies in the area worth recommending? Any areas I should avoid?

1o6nj19,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1o6nj19/sf_cincy/,Sf > Cincy ??,"Hi friends

I’m potentially facing a big life decision and need a sanity check. I recently lost my job in SF and was very close to landing a new job with a company I really want to work for before they pulled the req last minute and transferred it to the Midwest. Sounds like they would still hire me if I’m open to relocation. 

There’s two roles open: MI/WI or OH/IN. The leading contender is Cincinnati but also want to learn more about Detroit, Madison, Ann Arbor, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Columbus. My gf is from Cincy and has family/friends there. I went to school in Ohio, been to Cincy/Cleveland a few times, so have some familiarity/friends. 

I’m originally from the DC area but moved to Austin Tx for a few years and loved it but then a job promotion took me to San Francisco. I’ve been here for a couple years now and have fallen in love again. Of course, it’s extremely expensive and I don’t ever see myself owning a home here and always figured I wouldn’t be here forever, but I don’t feel ready to leave just yet. 

The thought of leaving SF for a Midwest city is making me sad but I know there’s a ton of positive tradeoffs especially financially. Which of these cities gets closest to the nature, the weather, the history, the food, the soul, the charm, the events, the overall beauty and vibrancy of Sf? 

I enjoy nature/spending time outdoors, live music, pro sports, dive bars, good food (especially Mexican and Italian), record shops, coffee shops, bookstores, city parks…you get it. An overall walkable neighborhood and city. 

Pros of moving are basically landing a well paying job with a company I want to work for, significantly lowering my COL, and getting closer to family/friends. 

Cons are leaving a great location in one of the greatest cities in the country. With the other option just being waiting/finding another job in Sf. This seems like a classic head vs heart decision. 

Idk what I’m asking really. I guess tell me how great Cincy or those other Midwest cities are. Tell me the lower COL is worth the trade off. Or don’t, if you left a major VHCOL vibrant/cultural hub with close proximity to jaw dropping nature for a smaller Midwest city and regretted it, tell me that too. 

Thanks

As we moved down the street, it was calm, it felt like we walked for miles, just chatting and enjoying the sights and sounds of life, we moved back through the park, the sun was starting to come down, settling itself in for the evening. 

She had a calm demeanor about her, I don’t think I had ever seen that happy or content. It was good to see, When she was around him, she seemed stressed, I never approached her while they were together out of respect, but I could feel the energy and it felt like she didn’t really want to be with him. I guess maybe I was over thinking a bit, sprinkled with a bit of wishful thinking. 

But she was calm, like she could take on the world again, knowing someone was there right behind her. Maybe that was peace of mind enough. I couldn’t say. I didn’t want to pry, I wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and push her worries off to the side, if even it was only briefly. 

“So I know you want to do this dinner thing, and I’m still down for it, but I was gonna run home, shower quick, and take care of laundry at my place, week is about to start and I wanna have my Ts crossed and I’s dotted.” 

“Wow, are you in my head? I was thinking the same thing. How about that ☺️” 

“Possibly, but not really, did you have any pressing issues before tonight?” 

“Nope, my laundry is done and I’m ready for the week.” 

“Okay awesome, then will you do a favor for me quick? Do you mind? If it’s too much, no worries I’ll take care of it.” 

“What’s up?” 

“Here take my debit card, do you want to run to the store and pick up some groceries? Stuff for tonight?”

She gave me a look of confusion..

“Are you sure? That’s a lot.”

“Yea I trust ya, figured we could kill two birds with one stone type deal, if you’re not comfortable with it, that’s fine, I’m fairly quick, so I can make the trip while laundry is going.” 

“No it’s okay I got it, but wow.” 

“Hehe” I couldn’t help but giggle, but I trusted her at this point. However I wasn’t trying to just barge my way into her life, or make any expectations of her, given everything else going on, it might have been a little much. 

“What’s the pin?” She said as she reached her hand out to me.

“0000, I know creative right?” 

“I wasn’t going to say anything but that feels like a you thing to do 😂” 

“Yea I like to keep it simple.” 

“Same” she gave a smile and a wink. “So what time were you thinking?” 

“Well it’s 5:30 now, how about 8? Gives us both some time apart, but not for long.” 

“I like that idea, don’t get me wrong, I enjoy your company, but space is always good too”

“Exactly!” I said in a relieved manner. 

“Get what you want, it’s on me.” 

“Are you sure? I’m not gonna owe you anything after am I?” 

“Well maybe a kiss, but you got kids, I wouldn’t want to just expect you to shell out of your pocket, especially when little ones are involved.” 

“Well what about you?” She asked? 

“My kids are fine, they got lots to choose from, if I was worried I wouldn’t have offered.” 

At this point I’m not sure if she wanted to hug me, break down and cry or what, but her energy shifted, I felt it. 

“You’re nuts you know that right?” 

“I wouldn’t say nuts, just empathetic and understanding, As I said always at your pace” 

“You keep saying that, I know what you mean, but why?” 

“Because I would never put you in a position to make you uncomfortable, and if I do, let me know so I can change it, I am terrible at hint’s plus I’m kinda traditional in some ways when it comes to.. what ever this is. I pay for food, etc. yea a little old school but it has its place I think.” 

“Do you want anything specific while I’m out? 

“Not that I can think of, get what ya want, I gotta run and take care of some stuff, see ya in a while?” 

“Yea.. a while😘” 

I made sure to get her back to her place, giving her a kiss as I left, she had a look of longing and wonder in her eyes as I walked back home. 

I hurried back as quick as I could, plans were set and I got to work, I stripped, got into the shower and cleaned up quick, making sure to trim myself up in the process. Scratchy face isn’t much fun, especially for the opposite sex, no matter where you’re kissing. 

Once I hopped out of the shower, I got a text from her, “hey I’m at the store do you want any kind of coffee for the morning?”

“Ohh yea, will you grab some hazelnut coffee and creamer, I have a thing for it. Lol”

“Sure thing, anything else?” 

“Naa, can’t think of anything, thank you!” 

“You’re welcome. See you soon.” 

I quickly got my laundry in the washer, did a few chores around the house and basically waited for a little while, there was little more I could do, I’ll have to admit I felt bad thinking about it, she was out shopping and I was sitting down doing the “hurry up and wait” game. 

I had about another hour and a half to go. Things were running smooth. The only thing I could do was be patient. 

With that I put on the TV, waiting on laundry and for 8 to get here sooner rather than later.. ",1,1760466359.0,u_Sad-Information3848,0,1.0,False

Not because I’m anti-social, but because capturing ideas in real time is actually possible with voice apps like Wispr Flow. So, is that really a win?

I started using Wispr Flow after seeing people brag about hitting up to 180 words per minute and syncing instantly with Notion or Slack. It is definitely fast. No more losing ideas mid-walk or while making coffee. For anyone creating content or juggling lots of thoughts, that feels like a game changer.​

Here’s where it gets messy though:

* Privacy feels questionable. Wispr promises not to store what you say with “privacy mode,” but honestly, how do you prove that?​
* Battery drains way faster than just typing out notes.
* Transcription isn’t always accurate. Sometimes my best ideas turn garbled or get autocorrected into something completely random.
* Managing voice files is a job by itself. Notes pile up and searching through them later is tedious.

I still use it because it’s hands down easier than typing on the go, and it helps me catch ideas before they disappear. But these issues are pretty annoying. Makes me wonder if anyone has found smarter, more secure workflows or apps out there.

For those using voice-to-text:

* Has using voice notes made staying creative or productive easier for you?",2,1760466211.0,CreatorsAI,1,1.0,False

...and it's because I'm an idiot. I make flavored cold brew making kits, and playing with flavors was such a fun hobby. I figured it'd be fun to see if anyone else liked them.

* I didn't calculate how much my supplies cost (I don't know why I just thought ""it's coffee, that's so cheap!"" Well, not using the only beans that make the flavor profile I want.)
* I didn't realize Shopify had its own way to buy postage...so I went to the post office, picked what I thought was the cheapest box, but ended up paying $28 for shipping total. (I was too tired and demoralized to try to correct my mistake once I was at the window.)
* I priced at what I thought people who spend -- NOT a profitable amount.
* It was 2 good friends who purchased it, and I love them so I gave them a discount on top of my low pricing.

  
And not to mention it took me SOOOOOO long to just package the number of coffee servings I offered. And that's after it took me WAY longer to set up the store and Meta ads in a way that seemed pretty/reasonable.

1o6neah,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6neah,"CEO-to-worker pay gap surges to 632 to 1 at US’s lowest-paying large firms, study shows","Some of the US’s lowest-paying large firms increased their CEOs’ compensation by an average of almost 35% over five years, according to new research. Their workers’ salaries did not keep up.

As executive remuneration ballooned, the average CEO-to-worker pay gap across the 100 companies in the S&P 500 with lowest median worker pay – dubbed the Low-Wage 100 by the Institute for Policy Studies – widened by 12.9% between 2019 and 2024, from 560 to 1 to 632 to 1.

Median pay increased only modestly, whereas CEO pay really skyrocketed,” said Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, and author of the report.

Between 2019 to 2024, CEO pay at these companies increased by 34.7%, unadjusted for inflation, compared with a 16.3% increase in these firms’ average median worker pay during the same period – short of inflation, which came to 22.6% over the same period.

By last year, average CEO compensation in the Low-Wage 100 stood at $17.2m. Average median worker pay was $35,570.

Of the 100 firms, median worker pay fell at 22 between 2019 and 2024. Ulta Beauty reported a 46% drop in median worker pay to $11,078 as the company significantly expanded its part-time workforce.

Starbucks’ CEO pay was the largest gap in 2024, with its CEO, Brian Niccol, receiving total compensation worth $95.8m, 6,666 times as much as the company’s $14,674 median pay.

It’s a stunning message for Starbucks management to send to their workers who’ve organized unions at 570 stores in recent years, and they’re still waiting for the company to negotiate a contract. It says a lot about who they really value at that company and who they don’t,” said Anderson.

Starbucks did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the report.

The IPS report cites a June roundtable hosted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US markets regulator, on executive compensation disclosure requirements, where Drew Hambly, investment director at CalPers, the largest public pension fund in the US, described the negative impacts overcompensation of executives has on low-wage workforces.

I do want our boards to think more about the bottom 50% of people who work for them,” Hambly said. “Because when I go into a business, I’m probably interacting with a lower-wage worker. And if you’re going to drive value over time, that’s the face of your company.”

In recent years US families have struggled with high costs for groceries and housing, and layoffs have been on the rise. “In the midst of all of this, CEOs are focused on making themselves even richer, instead of thinking about the welfare of their employees or even the long-term growth of their company,” said Anderson. “I think if they continue on this path, it’s going to be a trend that is bad, not just for workers, but for these companies and our economy as a whole.”

Between 2019 to 2024, Low-Wage 100 firms spent $644bn on stock buybacks. More than half spent more on buybacks than on capital improvements at their firms.

Lowe’s spent $46.6bn on stock buybacks: $28,456 per each of the retailer’s 273,000 employees, according to the report. Home Depot ranked second in stock buybacks during this period, spending $37.9bn.

The report also noted 32 billionaires owe their wealth to Low-Wage 100 corporations, including eight billionaires from Walmart, four from Estee Lauder and three from DoorDash.

As policy solutions, the report highlighted support for a tax hike on corporations that pay their CEO at least 50 times more what they pay employees. It also urged policymakers to increase taxes on stock buybacks.

Ulta Beauty, Lowe’s and Home Depot did not respond to requests for comment.

A bit of background: I worked a little over a year in a big coffee chain that was honestly hell. Nothing surprising - heavy workload, constant staff turnover, minimum wage, and zero respect for employees. Basically everything you’d expect from a large corporate café.

Now I’m finally leaving that place and moving to another “chain,” but this one is much smaller — only three locations in a big city.

During my trial shift, I noticed that the atmosphere there was much calmer, the approach to coffee more thoughtful, and overall the service level noticeably higher compared to my previous job. Plus, the café isn’t located right in the city center, which already makes it feel less chaotic.

Still, I’m a bit anxious about how honest and decent the management really is, and I’m afraid of ending up in another toxic environment.

So my question is: what should I pay attention to when starting at a new coffee shop?
What are the positive signs that a place is worth staying at, and what are the red flags that scream “run”?

This is only my second barista job, so I don’t have much experience yet. I’d really appreciate any advice or stories from those who’ve been through similar situations.

Thanks in advance! ",2,1760466088.0,barista,4,1.0,False
1o6ndgm,https://i.redd.it/ssk1yhmfd4vf1.jpeg,I finally figured out my “jellyfish in the back of throat/nose” mucus feeling after 1.5 years of going insane and almost $3k in ent expenses,"For the last year and a half, I’ve had this horrible glob of mucus stuck in the back of my throat, like a jellyfish sitting right below my sinuses. It would pool there and barely drain. I had to do somersaults and weird head positions just to get a little relief. 

I saw 3 ENTs, had a CT scan, allergy testing, tried steroids, humidifiers, every nasal rinse/spray under the sun including a strange baby shampoo rinse recommendation, allergy meds, antibiotics, the list goes on. Nothing fixed it.

The actual diagnosis: Chronic Nonallergic Rhinitis with Hypersecretion

In my case, it started because I had a scab high up in my nose from a dry winter that never healed. Over time, it basically developed a biofilm (like the slime on your teeth when you first wake up, bacteria trapped in a mucous layer). That constant irritation caused my mucus-producing nerves to “reset wrong,” and the faucet just never shuts off. Thick, gelatinous mucus was draining nonstop and pooling in my throat. Seemed to be worse if I took any stimulant like coffee, adhd meds, or was a little less hydrated. Lots of bloody noses too. 

My doctor recently tried a different approach and prescribed Atrovent nasal spray (generic: ipratropium bromide). It blocks muscarinic receptors so the glands stop overproducing mucus. It worked instantly. First relief I’ve had in 18 months.  A $21 miracle in a bottle.

the doctor told me the glands are controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system (the same system that handles blinking, heartbeat, breathing, etc., without you thinking about it). A flare-up like this can be triggered by:
	•	Hormonal shifts
	•	Aging
	•	Past viral infections (ex: covid)
	•	Physical irritation (like my scab/biofilm situation)
	•	environmental changes like dry air, chemicals, etc.

In some chronic cases, there are even procedures to “disconnect” the nerve signal if meds don’t help but I’m hoping my nerves reset eventually so I don’t need Atrovent forever.

Posting this in case someone else is losing their mind and symptoms sound similar, you might want to ask about nonallergic rhinitis with hypersecretion and ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) and see if it gets you on the right path to solving your situation. 

Obviously do your own research and talk to a doctor, I’m just sharing my experience because this made me feel insane and no one could figure it out. If this helps even one person, worth it. Hang in there!",13,1760466055.0,Sinusitis,5,1.0,False
1o6nd5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1o6nd5f/26m_italyeurope_a_quiet_hello/,26M| Italy/Europe – a quiet hello 👋,"
It’s one of those evenings where everything feels a bit too quiet. I’m not sad exactly, just aware of how empty the room feels when there’s no one to share it with. 

I'm 26, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life’s not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won’t just get me, but who’s also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren’t a priority for you, we’re not meant for each other.

But this post isn’t just about politics. It’s about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go “so I was just thinking...”

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there’s beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn’t found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night “what even is happiness?” kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who’ll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other’s chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one’s watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi :)",1,1760466037.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I was working late, chugging lukewarm coffee and feeling like a real coder, you know? My task was simple: clear out the staging database to run some fresh tests. I had my command line interface open, the cursor blinking patiently. I felt that little rush of power you get when you're about to do something big.

So I typed out the command to drop the database, feeling pretty pleased with my efficiency. I hit Enter, and for a glorious second, everything was perfect. Then, my phone buzzed. And again. And again. It was the on-call senior dev. Slack notifications started screaming across my screen—critical alerts, site down, API unresponsive. My stomach didn't just drop; it plummeted. I looked back at my terminal window, and the horror washed over me. I wasn't connected to staging. I was on the live, production server.

That feeling is something I'll never forget. It was like ice water flooding my veins. I had just, with a single line of code, nuked the entire company's live data. I thought my career was over right then and there. I pictured myself being escorted out of the building, my keyboard confiscated as evidence. The senior dev called, and I answered with a shaky voice, 'I... I think I did something really, really bad.'

Thankfully, the senior dev on call was a legend. He didn't yell. He just said, 'Okay, don't touch anything. We have backups.' He spent the next hour walking me through the restore process. It was the most stressful hour of my life, watching the logs scroll by, praying the backup wasn't corrupted. In the end, everything was restored, and only about 15 minutes of data was lost. My boss just looked at me the next day and said, 'Congratulations, you've just had your trial by fire. You'll never make that mistake again.' He was right.
