The so-called food court had nothing but Maggi and greasy fast food not even a single cup of coffee. and to top it off, we had to **buy our own food**. No certificates, no Blackbox credits, no clarity on evaluation, and absolutely no guidance. Just confusion and silence everywhere.

They claimed it would be a 30-hour hackathon but abruptly ended it at 23 hours. During the second evaluation, I asked a volunteer if there’d be another round, they said no it was final. Yet they made us sit for another 5–6 hours, promising a “Revival Evaluation” that never happened. We sat there exhausted, hungry, and sleep-deprived, waiting for judges who never showed up.

And they randomly selected my team for an interview and literally **forced us to say good things** about the hackathon and their college even handed us pre-written lines saying, *“Don’t forget to mention this.”* Lmao, seriously?

And the funniest part the guy on the top right in the image (apparently one of the organizers, not sure though) proudly claimed they’re planning a 5K-member hackathon next year. Bro, you couldn’t handle 1K properly, 5K will be a full-blown disaster.

1on4ddv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1on4ddv,Is this so common these days?,"Long story short, this guy I met online, we spoke for a few days, and we met for a coffee date in a public place. Everything was okay until he started saying ""c'mon I deserve a kiss atleast"" even though I had told him that I'm not into casuals. He kept insisting and saying that ""c'mon let's go to your place"" and I was creeped out so I cut the date shirt making up at excuse about strict parents. He told the same thing on chat so I fought with him and deleted his number. No texts ever since. He apologized but I ignored and deleted the chat. This was in July end.

The day before yesterday he texted me out of the blue.
I genuinely thought that okay it's been a long time, blocking would be rude. So we chatted and then he started telling me about his female friend who seduced him and they ended up sleeping together. 

My question is ....are hookups/FWB/casual sex this common? I have male friends too...and let alone seduce them I don't even see them as men..! Genuinely speaking they are women for me. Forget sex, I wouldn't even flirt with them and they have been with me for a long time..! One for 4 years, another for 14 years, another for 11 years and just like that. I have this male friend who video calls me at 3 AM at night and all we do is roast each other. I don't even entertain casuals and men/women who do this give me the ick..not judging it's their choice but I'm genuinely concerned as to how they even tolerate a sexual touch from someone they don't love...I don't know why. Online I can't even talk with boys much... maximum for 2-3 days and then I'm done, I run out of topics and I ghost. The last person I ever felt an emotional connection to the soul was my ex with whom I broke up 3 years ago.! How do people even do this bro..? 😭 And every female in my friend group hate casuals to the core...I have this friend who doesn't even let a guy touch her even if they are friends.

1on4bnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigGirlDiary/comments/1on4bnb/2025113_i_hate_how_emotional_stability_became_the/,2025/11/3 I hate how “emotional stability” became the default standard for women,"I’ve grown to really hate the phrase “emotionally stable.” Especially when it’s used to describe a woman, it always seems to mean the same thing: she doesn’t get angry, she doesn’t complain, she doesn’t make anyone uncomfortable.

I’ve heard so many “compliments” like that:  
“She’s so calm, she never gets mad.”  
“She’s so understanding, never loses her temper.”  
It sounds like praise, but really, it’s a demand in disguise.

I was that kind of “praised” person growing up. As the middle child, I had to handle my sister’s bad temper and my little brother’s tantrums. People said I had a good personality, but the truth is, I just learned to endure. I didn’t get angry, not because I didn’t feel things, but because I knew if I did, I’d be blamed for “causing drama.”

Later, I realized it’s not just women, almost every adult is trapped by this idea of “emotional stability.” It’s like once you grow up, you’re not allowed to feel anymore. You can’t break down. You can’t cry. You can’t lose your temper. But people aren’t machines, who can stay “stable” all the time?

Sometimes I do lose it. Maybe it’s spilling my coffee because someone bumped into me on the subway, or getting unfairly scolded by my boss. Those tiny moments of frustration make me feel ashamed, like I’ve exposed an “immature” side of myself.

But I’ve come to understand something, emotions aren’t signs of weakness. They’re proof that you’re alive. Suppressing, holding back, pretending to be calm, that just makes you numb.  
Real stability isn’t about having no emotions. It’s about being allowed to have them and still being understood.

I hate how “emotional stability” has become the default setting not just for women, but for all adults.  
Because we should have the right to express emotions without being labeled “too emotional.” And I want to say I have emotions, and I’m still a grown, respectable person.",1,1762150299.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

1on49l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_maxi0218/comments/1on49l8/home_rowing_machine_the_complete_guide_to/,"Home Rowing Machine: The Complete Guide to Low-Impact, Full-Body Fitness at Home","**If you’re short on time but serious about results, a** [home rowing machine](https://www.merachfit.com/collections/rowing-machines) **is the smartest upgrade to your routine.** It delivers cardio and strength in one, is gentle on the joints, and fits seamlessly into busy family life. This guide covers everything you need to know—from benefits and buying criteria to set-up tips, starter programmes, and FAQs—so you can choose confidently and start strong.

# Why a Home Rowing Machine Belongs in Your Space

**Total-body training in one move**  
Each stroke recruits legs, core, back, and arms, giving you the calorie burn of cardio with the muscle engagement of strength work.

**Low impact, high return**  
Rowing is easier on knees and ankles than running or plyometrics, making it ideal for beginners, return-to-training phases, and longevity-focused athletes.

**Efficient for busy schedules**  
Because you’re working so many muscles at once, you can get meaningful sessions in **15–25 minutes**—perfect for early mornings, lunch breaks, or after school drop-offs.

**Quiet, compact, family-friendly**  
Modern magnetic rowers are whisper-quiet and offer vertical storage. Multi-user profiles make it easy for the household to share one machine.

# Types of Home Rowing Machines (and Which One Suits You)

**1) Magnetic resistance**

* *Best for:* Apartments, late-night workouts, consistent resistance, quiet operation.
* *Why choose it:* Smooth feel, adjustable resistance, minimal maintenance.

**2) Air resistance**

* *Best for:* Athletes who like resistance to scale with effort.
* *Why choose it:* “Livelier” feel; the harder you pull, the more resistance you get. Slightly louder due to the fan.

**3) Water resistance**

* *Best for:* Users who want a realistic “on-water” feel and who don’t mind a gentle whoosh.
* *Why choose it:* Aesthetically pleasing, satisfying stroke feedback. Requires occasional water treatment.

**Quick decision tip:**

* Need quiet + consistency → **Magnetic**
* Want sport-style responsiveness → **Air**
* Love the look/feel of water → **Water**

# What to Look For When Buying a Home Rowing Machine

**Ergonomics & adjustability**

* Comfortable seat height, secure footplates, adjustable straps, handle that lets wrists stay neutral.
* Smooth rail and flywheel feel to encourage longer sessions.

**Space & storage**

* Measure your footprint. Many home units fold or store vertically.
* Check transport wheels and total weight if you’ll move it often.

**Noise**

* If you share walls or train at night, prioritise magnetic systems and a quality floor mat.

**Connectivity & coaching**

* App integration keeps you consistent: profiles, programmes, scenic rows, streaks, and weekly summaries.
* Look for metrics like split time (pace), strokes per minute (SPM), watts, and heart-rate support.

**Build quality & warranty**

* Stable base, durable rail, reliable resistance unit. A solid warranty signals confidence.

>

# How to Set Up Your Home Rowing Space (Even in Small Rooms)

* **Pick a visible spot.** Habits thrive when the machine isn’t hidden.
* **Use a mat.** Protect floors, dampen noise, and define your “training zone.”
* **Cable & device placement.** Ensure the tablet/phone mount is at eye level; route charging cables safely.
* **Lighting & airflow.** A small fan and warm lighting make sessions more inviting.
* **Prep the night before.** Shoes, towel, and bottle on the machine = fewer excuses.

# Technique Basics: The Stroke That Protects Your Back

Think **legs → body → arms** on the drive, then **arms → body → legs** on the return.

1. **Catch:** Shins vertical, torso tall, shoulders relaxed, eyes forward.
2. **Drive:** Push hard with the legs first; when the handle passes the knees, hinge the body slightly back; finish by drawing the handle to the lower ribs.
3. **Recovery:** Arms extend, torso folds forward, knees bend—smooth and controlled.
4. **SPM guide:**
   * Easy/Zone 2: **20–22 SPM**
   * Intervals: **26–32 SPM** (short bursts)

**Comfort cues:** Keep a neutral spine, relax your grip, and avoid “over-reaching” at the front.

# Three Plug-and-Play Programmes (15–25 Minutes)

**A) The 15-Minute Micro-Row (3×/week)**

* *4 min* easy warm-up (SPM 20–22)
* *8 min* intervals: **40s strong / 80s easy × 4**
* *3 min* cooldown + quick stretch *Goal:* Build the habit; minimal time, maximum consistency.

**B) Zone 2 Energy Builder (25 minutes, 3–4×/week)**

* *5 min* progressive warm-up
* *18 min* steady conversational pace (heart rate stays comfortable)
* *2 min* cooldown *Goal:* Improve cardiovascular base, daily energy, stress resilience.

**C) Hybrid EMOM (20 minutes, 2–3×/week)**

* *EMOM ×10:*
   * Odd minutes: **250–300m row**
   * Even minutes: **10 goblet squats** or **8 push-ups** (scale as needed)
* *6 min* technique row + *4 min* mobility (hips, lats, hamstrings) *Goal:* Strength + cardio in one efficient block.

**Pro tip:** Start with **A** for 2 weeks to lock in the habit, then add **B** or **C** based on your goals.

# Make Consistency Effortless: Habit Design for Real Life

* **Cues:** Keep the rower visible; set a recurring calendar slot (after school drop-off or post-meeting).
* **2-Minute Rule:** On low-motivation days, promise yourself two minutes. Most days you’ll keep going.
* **Streaks & rewards:** Celebrate adherence (not just performance). A coffee after three sessions works wonders.
* **If–Then plans:**
   * *If* the evening runs late, *then* do the 15-minute Micro-Row before shower.
   * *If* you miss two sessions, *then* reset with a short Zone 2 tomorrow.

# Results You Can Track (Without Obsessing)

* **Split (pace):** Average time per 500m—your core speed marker.
* **SPM:** Control intensity and efficiency.
* **Watts:** Power output—great for intervals and progress checks.
* **Heart-rate zone:** Keeps easy days easy and hard days honest.
* **Minutes per week / Streak length:** The simplest way to measure consistency.

# Safety & Comfort Tips

* Start lighter than you think and prioritise form for the first two weeks.
* Keep shoulders relaxed; think “long chain, smooth strokes.”
* If you feel lower-back strain, shorten the stroke slightly and focus on leg drive.
* Hydrate and add 3–5 minutes of mobility after most rows.

# FAQs: Home Rowing Machine Essentials

**Is a home rowing machine good for beginners?**  
Yes. It’s low impact and easy to scale. Start with short sessions and a comfortable cadence (SPM 20–22).

**How many minutes should I row?**  
For health and habit building, aim for **75–120 minutes/week** in total. That can be 15–25 minutes per session, 3–5 times a week.

**Magnetic vs air vs water—what should I pick?**

* Quiet apartments and late nights → **Magnetic**
* Sporty, responsive feel → **Air**

**Can my family share one rower?**  
Absolutely. Look for multi-user profiles, kid-safe settings, and adjustable footplates.

**Will a rowing machine help with fat loss?**  
Yes—when paired with consistent sessions and sensible nutrition. Programmes A and B above are great starting points.

# Conclusion

A **home rowing machine** is a rare win-win: low-impact, full-body, time-efficient, and genuinely enjoyable once you dial in the setup and habit. Start with a visible machine, tiny sessions, and one of the programmes above. Track minutes, not perfection. In a few weeks, you’ll feel the difference in your energy, posture, and mood.

1on4985,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicology/comments/1on4985/seeking_toxicologist_covert_chemo_xeloda5fu/,Seeking toxicologist - Covert Chemo (Xeloda/5-FU),"Hi! 
New here!
Hoping this group can help. My last partner had access to chemo drugs, specifically oral Xeloda from ‘caring’ for his sweet late wife prior to our relationship. Fast forward (isolation, manipulation, confusion, rage) and I found myself literally withering away. He brought me coffee every morning after his personal quiet time (*ahem* reading medical articles)….
After fearing for my life, I left. I never suspected  being drugged. But my intuition told me I’d die if I stayed one more night with him and my chest burned horribly.
4 days after leaving (also my last exposure) I was too frail to cry, my muscles were so dwindled and I was thinner than when I was in high school. I could feel my muscles burning out of my chest- like deep in my chest cavity. My nerves, tendons, everything. More painful than childbirth and felt like my organs were a moment from shutting down- but my body couldn’t handle expressing the pain. 
I suspect he as giving me hydromorphone, dexamethasone, and 5-FU. I didn’t want to believe the chemo and kept disregarding it but the new symptoms that popped up the last few weeks- swollen lymph nodes, low ferritin, mouth sores, some hair loss, GI issues, severe fatigue… everything- all line up with the drug (and long term exposure to corticosteroids). It didn’t make sense; why?
My inexperienced research has my suspecting: chemo- to erode my immune system and digestive system (his 1st of 2 deceased wives died of GI cancer very young) and the morphine to hide the pain so I didn’t notice until it was BAD- So I wasn’t bedridden, the dexathesone to perk me up a notch (some research supported it may artificially increase my WBC). 
As you smart peeps would know, none of these drugs show up in my blood after a few hours/days and I had no CLUE the moment I left what to specifically test for or how to get the right tests. 
BUT, I have basic blood labs that show slight abnormalities. And only on week 4, started care with a thorough naturopath who is helpful but…
This man is walking free- having got to abused me down to my mitochondria. Law enforcement will do nothing without actual evidence. All I can hope for is someone analyzing my prior labs and medical reports of my symptoms/photos over the weeks since I left. 
Not having cancer, oncology won’t mess with me- so I’ve been navigating my chemo journey on my own. I have a hard time sleeping knowing this man is very covert and was likely trying to kill me and doesn’t want me to talk… I worry this sadistic man with his personality type would likely want me quiet for good. 
I’m hoping for conclusive evidence so law enforcement can do their thang so I can rest well at night and no longer be silent. 

Thank you for your help. ",1,1762150044.0,toxicology,0,1.0,False

There’s nothing particularly interesting or novel about it, I just want to contribute to the public stories available!  
  
**Pre-drug background**  
I have been depressed since I was a kid. My depression manifested as persistent sadness, although I was generally still pretty motivated, though I've had problems with tiredness since high school. I never had an anxiety.   
  
Starting in high school I recognized it for what it was and over the years I kept on making more changes to my life and improving, but it never really went away. By the time I was 28, my life was objectively great: I finally figured out how to sleep ok, have low stress in my life, and have good friends, which were three major drivers of depressed state. Nonetheless I just always was generally sad and unable to enjoy life. I tried going to therapy but didn’t get very far because I was like yeah I don’t have much to complain about, I am theoretically happy with my life I just feel sad for no apparent reason.  
  
Somewhere around 29 I also underwent some undefined physical change where I suddenly started having more anhedonic depression rather than unipolar, and also had my first experience with ED.  
  
At 30 I had a bad break up and also experienced anxiety for the first time as a result of that relationship. In the aftermath I finally decided to start antidepressants. I started on lexapro/escitalopram. I continued to be very depressed for the first six weeks until after about six weeks suddenly I started feeling better. I remember when I first started noticing a difference it sort of felt like I could feel it in my body which was a surprise. Sort of like there’s some almost happy feeling in my skin. It was hard to describe. That ushered in a period of good health!  
  
**Chapter 2: Wellbutrin**  
For the next year or so I was probably in one of the best states of my life. I finally felt like I wasn’t depressed. I was on 10 mg of escitalopram, which was just enough to tip me over the edge. I didn’t notice obvious side effects except that my dreams got more vivid. At some point there I got in a relationship, and had problems with ED again. Just like Reddit said, I could get hard but 70% of the time I couldn’t come. So I supplemented my escitalopram with 50 mg of Wellbutrin. This did the trick.  
  
However, a few months later I stopped to the Wellbutrin and still had no problem coming. I didn’t notice any side effects. In reality I think the ED was probably mostly from being new to sex and not from the meds at all.   
  
**Chapter 3: More coffee**   
I’ve been having one cup of coffee every day for the last five years or so. When I’m on it I feel really happy and inspired and it’s one of the best antidepressants I have. At some point around when I started Wellbutrin, I also added a half cup in the afternoon. This ushered in probably my most energetic year of my life. I was constantly doing side projects and a lot of work.  
  
**Chapter 4: developing resistance**  
I started Lexapro on my 30th birthday. I am about to turn 34. I am still much better than I was before I started it, but the past year or two I’ve definitely noticed that my daily happiness levels have retreated from neutral-positive to hovering around neutral-negative. This year especially I’ve also had a lot more difficulty concentrating, and also motivating, and I have been more frequently discouraged than I was in the past I think. Sometimes I have ""low dopamine weeks"" where it's super hard to get out of bed or motivate to do anything.  
  
Also: I thought that as a result of my age I’d become extremely sweaty and started to have poor short-term memory. I have also gained some weight since turning 30. And I assumed that it was because of the coffee that I was usually so groggy in the morning. However, I now have realized these might all be Lexapro side effects! What was most surprising to me was reading that people on Reddit report lowered energy or motivation as a result of this drug.  
  
The lack of motivation/energy and self perception of poorer memory has definitely been a large negative factor in the past year. I think these are probably at least 60% existing factors, but they might also be related to the Lexapro. Therefore I am considering tapering off. But I know how difficult tapering is, and I also know that if I start feeling depressed while tapering, even if it’s because of something totally unrelated, I will psych myself out and think that it was because of the tapering. So therefore I’ve decided to do an extremely slow taper, of 0.9 mg for one month, and then 0.8/0.7/0.6 mg for two months each, with the final goal of 0.5.  
  
Tapering off something because you think you’ve developed resistance is definitely a counterintuitive strategy, but if indeed I do get some energy back, I can use that energy to direct towards having a more rigorous exercise schedule, which hopefully should compensate for whatever serotonin I might lose! Heck, I can even placebo myself into believing that I have more energy just because of this. Placebo for the win!  
  
I have also developed more resistance to coffee, and I will often feel tired again 10 to 20 minutes after drinking. I would love to have its effects back. I would also like to taper down on coffee because I think I’ve been overdosing and it probably affects my baseline energy level. Tapering coffee is hard because dosage is less precise, but I might see if i can taper from 25g ground coffee in pourover, and remove 1g every week or two until I get to 18g.",1,1762149763.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

Second disclaimer, while I do accept donations, any erp (erotic roleplay) I offer will not require any form of payment. I understand that there are those who charge for their time or services and I respect them but I am not one of them. Additionally, donations will not persuade me to spend more time rping with you or reconsider any of my limits. If you try to offer a donation for those reasons or any similar reason I will warn you once and immediately block you if you do so again. You should only be sending a donation if you enjoy my writing and the stories I post, and please only donate if you can comfortably do so, while I would like to make this kind of writing profitable I am able bodied and capable of finding other work. Please do not donate *anything* if you are struggling financially in any way, take care of yourself first and foremost. 

And with that out of the way, hello hello!! I apologize for the serious tone but as this is the first time I'm trying something like this I want to make sure all of my ducks are in a row. You can call me Mixture Guilty, or Mixture/MG. I've been in the roleplay scene for almost five years now and I really enjoy the process of making stories, world building, and finding all kinds of unique ways to build (and break~) characters! Like I said in my profile's about me, I have so many stories just waiting to break free from my mind, and with this account I hope to share them with as many folks as possible! And as mentioned before I will be accepting donations if you really like the stories that I write, while I was going to make a patreon they did end up asking for my ID... and with all the data leaks in the world as of recent I just really felt it wouldn't have been safe making a patreon account. While I look for an alternative, I'll have my cashapp tag in this post as well as in my about me section of my profile. There will be a Buy Me a Coffee link at the end of this post too, and if anyone knows of a better croud funding site/app then please let me know!

 With patreon I was going give subscribers sneak peeks at chapters and such... but now I'll have to find a different way to thank all of my supporters besides listing your names at the end of each chapter/post. And another disclaimer, this account will be mainly for advertising my writings. Which means chapters will be posted over and over again to different subreddits and such. I'm thinking about making accounts specifically for each story for easier reading but I'll do more research on that... and of course suggestions are more than welcome! 

With that, if you've take the time to read up to this point then thank you!! I'll be posting my kinks and limits (for rp purposes) in another post, as well as some information if you'd like to commission me to make a story for you~. The ultimate goal would be to publish a book, and I know amazon has a way for self publishing but I'd like to stay away from that until they get the ai mess under control... 
And now the moment you've all been waiting for, my (not so) spicy links! I hope you all have a wonderful day!

As by your request (especially u/[Big-Acanthaceae-6373](https://www.reddit.com/user/Big-Acanthaceae-6373/)) , this week, we're doing an additaional deep dive on a single topic that  you have been asking about: the anti-TL1A drugs that are now in late-stage Phase 3 trials. This is a completely new class of medication, and it's one of the most exciting developments in the IBD pipeline.

Researchers are intensely focused on TL1A (Tumor Necrosis Factor-like Ligand 1A) because it’s a protein that is thought to be a key driver of *both* inflammation and fibrosis (intestinal scarring). Current biologics are great at targeting inflammation, but this is the first major class of drugs also being studied to see if it can tackle the fibrotic damage that leads to strictures.

The two main drugs leading these Phase 3 efforts are Tulisokibart (MK-7240) from Merck (which was formerly known as PRA023 from Prometheus) and Duvakitug (TEV-574) from a partnership between Teva and Sanofi. Both have shown very promising results in their Phase 2 studies, prompting the massive, global Phase 3 trials that are underway right now to confirm their safety and effectiveness.

1. **Merck Press Release on Tulisokibart (MK-7240):** This is a non-technical announcement from Merck (Oct 2025) about their clinical development program. It clearly states the Phase 3 trials (ATLAS-UC and ARES-CD) are underway.

He came over to watch a movie and then things escalated, and i dont even think i wanted them to. i just didn't want to mess anything up by saying no. we then didnt really text throughout the week and it was a bit awkward, but then we met up again at a halloween party, where i was drunk, and he kept getting me more drinks. then he basically immediately ordered an uber right when he got there back to my dorm, and i was still very drunk.

he made important decisions to escalate things in a manner i was not ready for, and asked me and i said yes, but again, i was drunk and would not have said yes if i was sober. then, i stupidly said i really liked him, and asked if he really liked me, and he said ""sure."" then when i said, why, he said, ""youre smart, pretty, and semi-funny"" as a backhanded compliment. he then offered to buy plan b if i said yes to doing it again, and to reiterate again, i was very drunk and said yes. i then texted him after and he said he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted something casual. i feel so so stupid. at the end of the day he is just some dumb athlete frat guy but i feel so dumb for thinking he liked me. this also happened at a really hard and low time in my life, and i just feel pathetic like i compromised my morals and independence for any semblance of care or connection i could grab onto.

the question is: why did his actions and desire for a relationship change so suddenly? i likley seemed messy since i was drunk. did this make him not like me, or do you think he just decided he didnt like me when he got to know me? also why would he call me ""semi-funny"", that is such a degrading and backhanded compliment when i was nothing but kind.",1,1762149079.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I made a stupid mistake. I've been taking semaglutide in gradually increasing doses since 8/2024. I stopped taking it all together in preparation for a medical procedure at the beginning of September earlier this year. My last dosage was 2.5mg/week and I was even beginning to feel like my body was adjusting to that and was contemplating increasing or switching over to tirzepetide. 

After 2 months off I decided to start semaglutide back up again this week after I noticed my weight creeping back up slightly (I gained 4-5lbs) and decided to start with a slightly lower dose from where I stopped by injecting 2mg thinking that would be fine.

 It's been over 48h and I haven't been able to hold down any food or liquids. I have a horrible headache and I'm not sure if it's related to overdosing or just caffeine withdrawal as I haven't been able to keep down any coffee either. I have waves of intense stomach discomfort and nausea basically all of the time.

This season, the **別注W Insulated Jacket【限定展開】25AW** captures that spirit perfectly. Combining modern functionality with refined minimalism, this limited-edition insulated jacket represents the evolution of Japanese outerwear design. Now available exclusively through **OneMall**, it’s the ideal time to **buy from Japan** and experience the beauty of crafted warmth.

# What Makes “別注” Special?

In Japanese fashion culture, “別注” signifies more than just exclusivity — it represents the harmony of collaboration, craftsmanship, and intention. A *Becchū* piece is often a reinterpretation of a brand’s signature item, made in collaboration with select retailers or fashion houses, and released in limited quantities. The **W Insulated Jacket** follows this tradition, designed with an elevated sense of utility and aesthetic restraint that defines modern Japanese design.

Unlike mass-produced winter wear, this **limited edition insulated jacket** is made for discerning individuals who value subtlety over logos and quality over quantity. Every stitch, every seam, and every choice of fabric is deliberate — a quiet luxury that speaks volumes to those who notice details.

# Design Concept: Precision and Purpose

The **別注W Insulated Jacket** brings together two core elements of Japanese craftsmanship: functionality and simplicity. Constructed using **ThermoLayer® insulation**, the jacket provides outstanding heat retention while maintaining a sleek silhouette. It’s lightweight yet durable, ideal for urban commutes, weekend getaways, or even outdoor travel during cold months.

* **ThermoLayer® Core:** Advanced insulation for superior warmth without the bulk.
* **Water-Repellent Outer Shell:** Protects against light rain and snow while maintaining breathability.
* **Ergonomic Fit:** Tailored for movement — from morning coffee runs to late-night city walks.
* **Hidden Utility Pockets:** Smart design that blends practicality with minimalist form.
* **Adjustable Cuffs & Hem:** Ensures a personalized fit and seals warmth when temperatures drop.

Each jacket goes through meticulous quality control to uphold the high standards of Japanese production. From the smooth YKK zippers to the precision stitching, every component reflects the country’s renowned attention to craftsmanship.

# Japanese Craftsmanship Meets Global Appeal

Japan’s fashion philosophy has always centered around the idea of *less but better* — focusing on timeless pieces that grow more personal with wear. The **W Insulated Jacket** exemplifies that ethos. Its quiet design doesn’t demand attention, yet its quality commands respect. This is clothing made for longevity, not just a single season.

For international fans of **Japanese fashion**, finding authentic limited-edition pieces can be challenging. That’s where **OneMall** comes in — a trusted platform that allows you to **buy from Japan** directly, ensuring authenticity, transparent pricing, and access to items that rarely make it overseas. Whether you’re collecting exclusive collaborations or curating your seasonal wardrobe, OneMall bridges the gap between Japanese designers and global audiences.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Building your dream home is a unique journey, and choosing the right structure is key. Barndominium kits offer an exciting and practical solution. These kits combine the rustic charm of a barn with the comfort of a modern home. Whether you're looking for an investment property, a permanent residence, or a vacation getaway, barndominiums are gaining popularity for good reasons.

First off, barndominiums are known for their cost-effectiveness. Traditional homes can come with high costs, not only for materials but also for labor. With barndominium kits, much of the heavy lifting is done for you. The pre-cut materials and detailed plans allow for quicker assembly, which significantly reduces labor costs. You save money on the build without sacrificing quality. In fact, many homeowners appreciate the ability to customize their barndominium to fit their budget and style.

Barndominium kits are also highly customizable. You can choose layouts, finishes, and fixtures that reflect your personality. Want an open floor plan with high ceilings? Or perhaps a cozy loft? The possibilities are almost endless. Most kits allow you to pick different materials, colors, and features to make the space truly yours. This level of customization is harder to achieve with traditional homes. You have more freedom to create a space that fits your lifestyle.

Another key benefit is durability. Barndominiums are often built using steel frames, which are more resistant to harsh weather conditions than wood. This means fewer repairs over time, leading to long-term savings. Additionally, these durable structures tend to have lower insurance premiums due to their resistance to fire, pests, and severe weather.

Let's delve into some specific advantages of choosing barndominium kits:

- **Versatility:** Barndominiums are not just homes; they can serve multiple purposes. You can add workshops, garages, or even rental units within the same structure. This versatility makes them appealing for families and businesses alike.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominium kits come with energy-efficient features. Good insulation, metal materials, and thoughtful design contribute to lower energy bills. This is especially important if you plan to make your barndominium a permanent residence.
- **Low Maintenance:** Compared to traditional homes, barndominiums require less upkeep. With fewer nooks and crannies, cleaning is easier, and many materials used are designed to weather well over time.
- **Quick Build Time:** Because the kits are pre-designed, the construction process is often quicker. This means you can move into your new home sooner than if you were building from scratch.

Location is another factor that makes barndominiums attractive. These kits can be set up in rural areas where land prices are lower. It provides a chance for people to escape city life, offering more outdoor space and privacy. The open plan can also be perfect for integrating nature into your living environment. Imagine sipping your morning coffee while enjoying views of the countryside right from your living room!

Accessibility is yet another advantage. Barndominium kits are available from a wide range of suppliers. This means you can shop around for the best options, whether you prioritize cost, design, or durability. A variety of companies offer support, from initial consultation to finalizing your build, to ensure you get the right fit for your needs.

When you decide to buy a barndominium kit, you are also investing in a modern lifestyle. These structures reflect contemporary designs while embracing simplicity and efficiency. They cater to a broader range of lifestyles, from young families to retirees looking to downsize. The appeal of the modern farmhouse aesthetic, combined with the functionality of a barndominium, has sparked a trend that is impossible to ignore.

The benefits of barndominium kits extend beyond just cost savings. From customization and durability to versatility and energy efficiency, they present a unique solution for building your dream home. With careful planning and design, a barndominium can provide you with the perfect blend of rustic charm and modern comfort, making it a growing favorite among homeowners today.

Essential Steps for Buying and Building Your Barndominium
---------------------------------------------------------

Are you dreaming of a unique home that combines rustic charm with modern conveniences? A barndominium might be the perfect solution for you! This type of home offers versatility and character, and the best part is that you can build it yourself with the right kit. Understanding the essential steps for buying and building your barndominium is vital to ensure a smooth journey from start to finish.

The first step in your journey is to research different barndominium kits available in the market. Take time to browse through manufacturers and suppliers, comparing their offerings, prices, and materials. You'll find various designs, including open floor plans, multiple stories, and energy-efficient features. Make a note of what catches your eye and consider what will suit your needs and lifestyle.

When buying a barndominium kit, it's essential to check the quality of materials used. Look for kits that include high-grade steel or wood, as these materials offer longevity and durability. Also, consider whether the kit has insulation options and energy-efficient windows. This will help keep your energy costs low and ensure your home stays comfortable throughout the year.

Next, you’ll want to establish your budget. Barndominium kits come in various price ranges, so it’s crucial to determine how much you can invest before making any decisions. Keep in mind that your budget should include not just the kit itself, but also other costs such as land purchase, site preparation, permits, utilities, and finishes. Having a clear budget will prevent any surprises down the line.

Finding the right piece of land is also a crucial step in your barndominium journey. The land should be suitable for building and have access to necessary utilities, such as water and electricity. When searching for land, check local zoning laws and building regulations to make sure you can build a barndominium in that area. It's wise to consult with a real estate agent who can guide you through the process of finding the ideal spot for your new home.

Once you've secured your land, the next phase involves obtaining the necessary permits. Building permits ensure that your construction meets local building codes and safety standards. Most areas require permits, so it's vital to contact your local building department to understand what is necessary for your barndominium project. This step can take time, so plan accordingly!

Before you start putting together your kit, plan your layout. Think about how you want to use the space and consider factors like room sizes, open areas, and any specific features you want to include, such as a large kitchen or loft area. Creating detailed plans will help you visualize your future home and make the building process more efficient.

Once your plans are finalized, it’s time to get to work! The construction phase is where the excitement begins. Assemble the kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure everything fits together properly. It can be helpful to have a friend or contractor assist you during this stage, especially if you are inexperienced in construction. Keep a close eye on every detail, as this is where your vision starts to take shape.

During the building phase, don’t forget to celebrate small milestones. Each step you complete brings you closer to your dream barndominium. Whether it's raising the frame, installing windows, or roofing, acknowledge your progress. It helps keep the project enjoyable and motivates you to push through to completion.

After the kit is set up, you can dive into the interior work. This is where you get to express your creativity! Choose paint colors, flooring, and fixtures that reflect your personal style. Remember that the interior layout is just as crucial as the exterior. Consider the flow of the space and how it will suit your lifestyle.

Remember to take your time and enjoy the process. Building a barndominium is a rewarding endeavor, blending your ideas into a livable space. With careful planning and attention to detail, you'll soon have the home of your dreams. So, embrace this journey, and your barndominium will become more than just a house—it will be your sanctuary.

### Conclusion

Choosing a Barndominium kit can be a game-changer for anyone looking to build their dream home. Beyond the unique aesthetic appeal, these kits offer a blend of functionality, affordability, and durability that traditional homes often lack. They provide a fantastic solution for those who value open space and customization. You can tailor your barndominium to fit your personal style while enjoying the benefits of energy efficiency and low maintenance.

As you embark on your journey to buy and build your barndominium, following essential steps will be crucial. Start with thorough research to find the right kit that meets your needs and budget. Engage with reputable suppliers who offer quality materials and support throughout the building process. Planning is vital, so ensure you understand local zoning laws and regulations for a seamless construction experience. Collaborating with skilled builders can also turn your vision into reality, ensuring each detail aligns with your dream.

Building a barndominium is not just about creating a house; it’s about establishing a home that reflects your unique lifestyle and values. With careful planning and the right kit, you can transform your dream into a beautiful reality. By investing time in understanding both the benefits and the steps to building, you set yourself up for success as you create a space that is truly your own.

1on3pg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1on3pg4/how_do_i_43f_get_him_37m_out_of_here/,How do I (43f) get him (37m) out of here?,"TLDR: My partner is abusive and I'm not sure how to get him out of my home without risking my possessions and my pets. Legally, I have to give him 30 or 60 days notice (not sure which yet). I work every day so he could easily take off with my shit or my fur babies. 

I don't feel comfortable continuing to live here with him for however long an eviction would take, but if I go elsewhere I can for sure kiss my stuff goodbye and he could screw me over with my landlord. (I give a lot of backstory in my post so it's looooong. Thank you in advance if you make it through the whole thing)

I've been with my partner (Tom, 37m) for over 2 years. It's over as far as I'm concerned, I've been wanting it to be over for a while. He's been verbally abusive since the relationship was still pretty young. He lost his job and his housing within the first few months of us seeing each other. He started staying over until one day he never left. I rent a two-bedroom townhouse and I was subletting a room to a friend of mine but she left within a few months of him moving in. For unrelated reasons, I think. At first I appreciated having Tom here. My ex had attempted to break in about 6 months earlier (he surely would have murdered me if he'd made it in before the cops arrived) for which he only got 3 months in jail, so I felt safer with Tom and his pitbull.

When Tom moved in, he brought a pitbull and an RV with him. I have 2 cats and his pitbull was cat aggressive, but I loved the dog so I let him stay which resulted in a very full house with a complicated situation where the cats or the dog had to be locked in a bedroom to keep them separate at all times. My roommate had broken her leg around this time and was stuck sleeping in the living room on the bottom floor, complete with a potty chair, because she couldn't do the stairs. Tom helped me take care of her, tending to her while I was at work during the day and then he and I would cook dinner together every night. I was doing most if not all of the cleaning and working full-time while there were two adults making a mess at home all day. That was the yellow flag that should have made me pay closer attention. For me to be able to function, I need a clean house, and I didn't take kindly to having to tell two adults to clean up after themselves, especially not on repeat. A lot of the time it felt easier to just do it myself.

My first red flag popped up in our first fight. I don't want to get too much into the nitty gritty, it has to do with sex, but the general issue was that Tom didn't believe me when I said I felt ok and he thought I was lying. He told me that he knows how I feel (he didn't) and I won't convince him any differently. This baffled me. He became absolutely enraged when I insisted that I'm the only person who can possibly know how I feel and he has no right to tell me how I feel. He claimed I was gaslighting him and called me a narcissist. The beliefs he reveals during all of our fights are just as baffling as the first, and his rage is easily unleashed. He assumes the worst about me every time, or claims to anyways, and the mental gymnastics he uses to get there are again baffling. These fights have always begun in ways that blindside me, like I could never have predicted them, which means I have no predictable way of avoiding them. So stressful. Tom and I haven't had a lot of fights in the time we've been together, like maybe one every few months of that, but that's mostly because I ""picked my battles wisely"" and often bit my tongue. Each time we've fought, I've been so disturbed by his nastiness and way of thinking that I've wanted to end the relationship. I just haven't known how to deal with the logistical nightmare of getting him out of here.

I have an autoimmune disorder that has caused me to be bedridden for extended periods of time throughout my adult life. I had partners to financially fall back on when it's happened in the past, but now I'm completely self-reliant and I live paycheck to paycheck while working full-time as it is. Chronic stress exacerbates my illness and has often been the thing which flips the switch where I become symptomatic. I was relatively healthy and extremely active when I first started dating Tom. But within less than a year of him moving in, I'm barely able to function. I drag myself to work every day but I'm in bed all the rest of the time. So I've become fairly isolated from my support system too. 

In the past 2+ years since Tom moved in, he has been reluctant to find a new job and has contributed to the costs more than the finances. Once my roommate recovered, she moved out, just a few months after Tom moved in, and I didn't feel like I could bring a new roommate into the situation, with the cats and dog and Tom's sloppiness. So I've been covering all the bills on my own for a long time, and Tom makes my life a LOT more expensive. I've been drowning financially and pleading with Tom to get a job and help out. He started doing in-home care for his friend for around 10 hours a week, which didn't pay much at all but at least he started to buy his own cigarettes and sometimes pitch in for fuel or groceries. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention he's been using my car this whole time, whenever I'm not at work. Sometimes he leaves for hours on end, until late into the night, he doesn't tell me where he's going and I don't ask. I know he likes to spend time at the casino (it's pretty much the only thing he likes to do) and whatever else, I don't really wanna know. 

I don't want to make it seem like Tom is a useless POS 100% of the time. He's not all bad - they almost never are, which is why we get stuck with them, right 🤷‍♀️ He brings me coffee or tea in bed every morning, sometimes breakfast, he's been doing all of the cooking and shopping since I got sick again, he draws me a bath every night, sometimes with candlelight, and he takes care of the pets while I'm at work. I've been working more than 40 hours a week to make ends meet, which has me on the brink of collapse, but I still do most of the cleaning and I take care of the pets when I'm home. Tom had started to come around to the idea of getting more work, after my ATM card declined at the grocery store a couple times in one month. But then he busted his back moving a pullout couch upstairs for his friend, so he's again been without an income for like 6 months, waiting on his workers comp to process.

Tom's pitbull passed away, in a really awful way, over a year ago, which devastated us both. I had spent more time with the dog than Tom had for the last year of his life, and this loss hit me harder than almost anything I'd ever experienced, but Tom was way worse off. I've never seen a man so broken. About 6 months later, I was dying to have a canine companion again and I wanted that for Tom too, as distraught as he still was. Tom came around to the idea but insisted on an 8 week old puppy. I said I don't have the energy to raise a puppy but he dismissed that as a valid concern. When we brought that puppy home though, Tom showed me on night one that he didn't have the patience nor the stomach to care for a puppy. Every morning before work I was cleaning a poo covered kennel and a poo covered pup. Every afternoon when I arrived home, the puppy was promptly handed over to me while Tom took off to God knows where. Forget that all I had the energy for was getting myself to bed, I had to limp downstairs every hour to potty train this puppy. Sometimes I literally had to crawl up the stairs. Now that the puppy is over a year old, he's still quite the handful, but of course he's much easier and Tom has been more engaged in his care. The dog is very attached to both of us but he literally worships the ground Tom walks on.

I'm beginning to get my health in check, thank goodness, it's far from a full recovery but things aren't feeling as excruciatingly difficult as they were a few months back. Tom and I had our biggest blow out yet a few months ago, I don't even remember what started it, it always starts with something trivial and quickly escalates to us fighting about the way we fight. For me it's always about how quickly he starts screaming, name calling, and getting in my face, and for him it's always about some nasty motive and intentions that he assigns to me (which have absolutely no basis in reality). But in the blow out a few months ago he came very close to hitting me, he threatened me and blamed me for making him, and I knew then that there was no coming back for me. The relationship has been irredeemable for the past few months but I've been stumped about how to get him the hell out of my home. 

We got into another fight last night, it started and developed with the same nonsense as usual. I asked him to lower the volume or put headphones in for the gruesome documentary he had playing on his phone because it was giving me anxiety. In response, he turned it up and shoved it onto my ear and wouldn't stop. A fight ensued when I tried to leave the room. And apparently there's nothing wrong with him treating me however he wants because it's not as bad as the ex who almost ended me. Anything goes as long as he doesn't hit me. Psychological distress doesn't matter and anyways you can just choose to not be distressed... I'm less baffled than annoyed anymore. Like he's one of the most intelligent people I've ever met but he doesn't understand the difference between feelings and behavior? 🤨 He wouldn't stop harassing me so I moved my stuff over to sleep in the other bedroom, he said he would leave my bedroom if I wanted so I moved my stuff back, and then he said lol just kidding and refused to leave so I moved again. I had to put headphones in to go to sleep because he wouldn't stop talking shit, trying to antagonize me from across the hall. That was about 24 hours ago and we haven't spoken since. He's been downstairs while I've stayed upstairs all day. But I did take back my bedroom. I'm so over this demented loser. This is not the worst relationship I've had but I have had ENOUGH. I long for the peace of being single. 

Now how do I get there? I never added him to my lease, which could get me in trouble with my landlord, but I didn't want to make his residency here so documented. However, he has plenty of mail to show he's been an established resident at this address for a long time. If I serve him with a formal eviction, that's going to piss him off and I worry he'd take his revenge out on my possessions and my pets. I don't think he'd harm the cats but I worry he'd give them away. He might just take off with the dog so I'd never see him again, and as far as that goes, what are we going to do about the dog? My preference would be some kind of shared custody, the dog is so attached to us both, but I don't trust that we can part amicably enough. If Tom fights my eviction in court, he'll lose but it might take a long time to get through the process, especially as backed up as eviction court is right now. I've thought about bringing other men home with me. Would that make him uncomfortable enough to leave? I've also thought about having a couple of my large man friends come over to forcefully eject him if need be. If I wage war like that, I'd definitely need to have someone here to watch my stuff while I'm at work and I'd need to change the locks once Tom left. I'm worried he might even steal my car. And again, going to war like that complicates things with the dog. I'm frozen. I don't know where to start.",1,1762148078.0,domesticviolence,0,1.0,False

Just random thoughts, no need to respond but are welcome to","Feeling a bit anxious because I am sitting in a busy cafe with lots of people around me. I am normally alone in my room so this is a lot of stimuli for my eyes and ears, and nose, and there are new textures and surfaces. I like the posters that are on the wall. There is one that says “Submission tastes better with Dead Kennedys, Circle Jerks, Bad Brains” . This is a cool newer coffee shop. They host open-mic nights on mondays. They also play good music, which is nice for me since I dont wear headphones. 

I dont like wearing headphones in public spaces. It cuts off an entire sense, which makes me feel vulnerable. I wouldnt be able to enjoy myself at all while wearing them. I would be too afraid of not hearing something important.

I do love wearing headphones when I am alone and in a more predictable environment. I was actually just having an interesting conversation a couple weeks ago with a fellow student about this. We were talking about how the new Apple Airpods can translate foreign language into your language in your ear in real time.

I was wondering what it would even sound like, whether or not there would be a delay. My friend was saying that the speech couldnt possibly be as smooth as what you would get with ChatGPT’s speech feature, which contains all kinds of regular nuances like breathing and clearing their throat, vocal fry, stuff like that.

We then started talking about how to adjust the base settings for headphones in the Spotify app, and I remember when that feature was so revolutionary to music listening be it in a car or through headphones. That was a fun bus ride. I used to want to be an audiophile, I even starting piecing together my own stereo system but I was being too choosy about what kind of receiver and speakers I wanted to get. Then I sold my records to buy cigarettes. If I had the extra money today I would probably set it up again. Until then, I can listen well on my wireless headphones. 

Back to my conversation with my friend, I learned a bit about different kinds of files. I had only heard of mpg. files, but apprarently mpg.’s are only the compressed version of something called flack. I dont understand much about it. From what I can tell its like how jpeg is a compressed version of a photoshop document, were the original document is what supports and stores all the layers while the compressed version just keeps it all together.

I have been thinking about the difference between a digital file of music versus an analog version of it, but then there is listening to it live which I have never really considered against the others. I always think of music like a way to get from point A to point B. A digital file relies on traveling from fixed point to fixed point in order to get from A to B. And as the music plays along, it sort of rounds out onto those fixed points. But with analog music, it takes the whole line into account. Something like that. I dont really know what I am talking about when it comes to music. I just know that I like to listen and seek patterns along the way. ",2,1762147968.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

I am:
* reasonably experienced low-tier home espresso maker
* US
* 3-4 doubles per day but only for myself, rarely pulling for others
* mostly interested in semi-autos, though I'm admittedly manual-curious but would really be getting it as a side piece...

I quite like the style of the Lelit machines (and La Marzocco but let's not go there) but fundamentally I want:
* temperature control
* pre-infusion control (if it's not a gimmick/wildly expensive)
* pressure dial (mostly for consistency's sake, I swap coffees a lot)
* reasonably fast heat up
* low necessity to mod for functionality
* a steam wand to make very occasional cappuccino (unless it's better to just get a milk frother these days)

Single boiler is fine for me because I'm the only coffee drinker.


The lelit anna seems to be on sale right now for $550!
The turin legato seems to be on sale for like $480!


Is one a clear winner? Are they basically equals? Is it deeply silly to upgrade from a barista perfetta (a PID machine with no temp control) to something just barely more functional? Is there a dark horse I'm not seeing?


There's also the lelit victoria, the ECM Casa V, Stone Lite, Bezzera, Profitec GO? Would it be a lot smarter to just bite the bullet and buy into the low-mid range machines?


Lelit Anna terminology question: I see many posts about the 'lelit anna 2'  / 'lelit anna PL41TEM' / lelit anna with pid' and the plain 'lelit anna'.

One moment, I was reading a sweet text from my husband, Damian Blake—""How's my girl today?""


The next, his ""fiancée"" just walked into my law office.


She was all breathy excitement, playing coy:


""I want to hire you for my fiancé's divorce. He claims his wife's a real classy bitch, so we gotta leave her some face.""


I glanced down at the intake form.


Client name: Damian Blake.


Clipped to the paperwork was a photo—same face I've woken up next to for nine years.


Except right now? He felt like a complete stranger


God, how ironic.


Five years as a divorce lawyer. Blown up more marriages than I can count.


Today, it was finally my turn.


Congratulations, Damian.


You just handed your mistress the one lawyer in New York who's going to make damn sure you regret it.


...


I closed the file and looked up at the woman sitting across from me.


She wasn't stunning—pretty, maybe. Petite frame, that kind of skinny you only got when you'd never carried a child.


Well-spoken, clearly raised right.


But there was a naive purity that hinted at her sheltered life.


When she mentioned her upcoming ""promotion,"" there's smug satisfaction in her eyes—mixed with just a hint of nerves.


""Ms. Monroe, so... what do you think we should do?""


""My fiancé wants his wife to step aside quietly. You know, for old times' sake. He doesn’t want drama.""


She said it softly, a shy little smile playing on her lips.


If I wasn't sure she had no clue who I am, I'd have sworn she was taunting me.


I curved my lips into my best professional smile.


""Ms. Rhodes, how long have you two been together?""


She blinked, caught off guard.


""Sorry?""


I slowed down, enunciating each word clearly.


""Before I can give you legal advice, I need to know every detail about your relationship.""


""Oh! Right."" She nodded, her voice going all soft and dreamy.


But with every word she said, my smile got colder.


""We've been together for two years. Met at a charity gala.""


""Someone in his family had just been diagnosed with something serious. He was devastated. Alone on the terrace. I happened to walk by, and we just... talked for a while...""


A faint blush crept across her cheeks.


""We clicked right away. Less than a month later, we were official.""


Listening to her sweet little love story, my chest tightened like a fist is squeezing my heart.


""You met him two years ago today?""


""Wait—how did you know that?"" Her eyes went wide with surprise.


I let a small smile tug at my lips, my lashes hiding the ice in my gaze.


Of course I knew.


Because two years ago today, my father had a massive heart attack. He died in the ER at New York-Presbyterian.


Around the time they were ""meeting,"" I was on my knees outside the emergency room.


Falling apart. Screaming until my voice gave out.


The old wound ripped open fresh, slicing through me over and over.


I took a silent breath and moved on to my next question.


""You know he has a four-year-old son? He just started preschool.""


""Oh yeah,"" that timid look vanished instantly, replaced with total confidence.


""He promised once we're married, I'll be Noah's mom. Kids don't remember anything anyway. Whoever loves them is their real parent.""


She looked at me, seeking validation.


""Don't you think so, Ms. Monroe?""


My knuckles went white. My face stayed calm.


""Sure. You're absolutely right.""


Too bad you'll never get the chance.


She relaxed completely now, her guard down. She kept talking.


Her tone actually got a little cheerful:


""He even showed me pictures of his wife. She's got this C-section scar on her stomach—super deep and ugly.""


""He said it grossed him out every time he saw it.""


She let out a light laugh.


""Ms. Monroe, don't you think that woman's pathetic? Like, why would she hold on this tight? God, how desperate can you be?""


I laughed too. My eyes were frozen solid.


""Ever consider the possibility that his wife has NO IDEA your affair?""


Chapter 2


""No way!""


Tiffany's voice was razor-sharp, absolute.


""Damian can’t even stand to touch her. You'd have to be brain-dead not to notice. With me? He's all fire and hunger. But at home with that plain Jane? Says he's suffocating.""


""Ms. Monroe, seriously—if you went two years without sex, wouldn't you find that weird?""


""I would.""


My answer came fast, but my eyes were locked on the Cartier wedding band on my ring finger.


Damian and I came from completely different worlds.


But we went from high school sweethearts to husband and wife. Nine years total.


When I got pneumonia, he drove through a blizzard—three hundred miles—middle of the night. Just to bring me medicine.


When I was upset, he'd scour the whole Manhattan for that one bakery I loved.


When I was pregnant, when I gave birth—he never missed a single prenatal check-up.


Every time he came home, he'd hug me and Noah first, telling us we were the best part of his life.


Even when we stopped sharing a bed two years ago, he'd explained it so gently.


""Babe, having Noah wrecked your body. I can't let you go through that again.""


I thought that after the passion faded, this was what marriage became—gentle, steady affection.


Never occurred to me he was just getting his satisfaction elsewhere.


Ice crawled through my veins, straight into my chest. I pushed out my last question.


""So you just want HER to file for divorce? That's it?""


""No,"" she shook her head hard.


""The most important thing is—his wife can’t find out he cheated. Yeah, she helped Damian rise, but his success was ALL his own now. If she finds out, she'll destroy him!""


""Ms. Monroe, you're the best divorce attorney in New York. Our future's in your hands.""


I smiled and nodded.


""Don't worry.""


The second she left, I called my partner Logan Reid.


""Logan. I need our top PI and forensic accountant. Now! I want every financial transaction and travel record Damian's made in the last two years.""


""And tell my uncle—that fund Damian runs? Time to pull our family's investment out.""


""I want to see if he can stay afloat without me.""


Logan was my golden partner for a reason—his efficiency was unmatched.


Within hours, an encrypted 256GB hard drive sat on my desk.


""Everything you asked for. It's all in there.""


I plugged it in. Clicked open.


First video: on a private yacht.


Damian in a white linen shirt, looking gentleman as he clasped a Graff diamond necklace around Tiffany's neck.


Last month on my birthday, Damian said he had an emergency meeting at work. When he got home, all he brought was a wilted carnation he'd bought off the street.


Second video: department store security cam.


Damian had his arm around Tiffany's waist as they browsed through luxury boutiques.


Clothes, handbags, shoes—shopping bags piled up at Tiffany's feet like a small mountain. The intimacy between them practically leaked through the screen.


At checkout, the associate threw in a music box—free gift. He ended up giving it to Noah and told him 'Daddy picked it out special'.


I closed the file without expression and opened the next folder.


Damian's offshore account showed multiple large transfers labeled as ""investment consulting fees""—all ending up in an account ending in 3308.


Account holder: Tiffany Rhodes.


Such a sloppy attempt at asset concealment. Did he really think I'd never find out?


The last file made my fingertips go ice-cold.


Chat logs from Noah's preschool teacher.


Tiffany had been posing as ""Noah's aunt,"" constantly asking about his daily routine. She'd even already RSVP'd to next week's parent day!


My hand clenched around the mouse.


I couldn't accept it. Damian's betrayal had already crept into our son's life.


When Noah was born, Damian had held that tiny life in his clumsy arms and promised he'd cherish him forever.


Even just now, when Tiffany said she wanted custody, I'd held onto a sliver of hope.


At least Damian loved our son.


Even if we divorced, at least he wouldn't hurt him.


I was wrong.


Chapter 3


A gaping hole tore open in my chest, icy wind howling through.


I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed my phone, ready to warn him to stay the FUCK away from my son.


But my phone buzzed first—a message from Tiffany.


She'd sent a photo of herself, asking for my opinion.


""Ms. Monroe, does this outfit work? Damian's taking me and Noah to meet his parents tonight. I'm so nervous.""


Almost immediately, Damian's message came through:


""Babe, Mom and Dad are missing Noah. I'm taking him to the estate tonight. You've been working so hard—I booked you a spa appointment at the Equinox Hotels. Go relax.""


Looking at my son's innocent face in the photo, I smiled softly.


A spa? Not nearly as entertaining as this little family dinner show.


If they were meeting the parents, naturally the REAL wife should be there to supervise.


I hung up and immediately drove straight to the Blake estate.


On the way, Damian's messages kept popping up.


""Babe, you there yet? Traffic's bad on the main road—everything okay?""


He was tracking my location.


Calmly, I found a random spa photo online and sent it.


""Just got here. Nice place.""


Short reply. But he seemed satisfied.


""Have fun. Love you.""


Same old sweetness. Now it just made me sick.


I pocketed my phone and ignored the rest.


I parked the car and slipped in through the side entrance, sunglasses on.


Dinner hadn't started yet, but most of the Blake relatives had already arrived.


Damian's mother Helena was bustling between the kitchen and living room, all smiles—


The same warm, attentive energy she'd shown me years ago.


When I was exhausted, she'd bring soup to my office every week.


When I was cold, she'd knit me scarves and slippers, treating me better than her own son.


She even remembered my father's back problems and went out of her way to find an acupuncturist to help him.


My father—who could read anyone—had told me:


""The Blakes are good people. Marrying into that family, I've got no worries.""


Now, she was the first to greet Tiffany as she walked in beside Damian.


""You must be Tiffany! So pretty—I can tell you'll give us lots of grandsons.""


""Damian, don't you dare mistreat this girl.""


Damian's dad Thomas, usually so reserved, set down his coffee and patted Damian's shoulder with satisfaction.


""Smart choice, son. About time we had more boys in this family.""


Suddenly, it clicked—they were mad I only gave them ONE.


Funny—since Damian was the one who said no to more kids.


Tiffany straightened proudly, her voice dripping with sweetness:


""Don't worry, Uncle Thomas, Aunt Helena. Damian took me to get checked. The doctor said I'm very likely to have boys.""


""Wonderful! Just wonderful!"" His parents beamed while my son stood alone in the corner, forgotten.


Relatives crowded around, showering her with praise.


The cousin I loaned $150K? ""Damian, you absolute legend!""


The aunt whose kid I got into a study abroad program? Sobbing. ""Tiffany's such a sweetheart!""


The cousin whose startup I saved with my connections? Raising his glass. ""To the happy couple!""


Every single one of them had benefited from my help. Not one of them remembered my name now.


The aunt wiped her tears, then excitedly grabbed my four-year-old son and shoved him toward Tiffany.


""Go on, call her Mommy!""


Helena immediately chimed in, forcing Noah's hand into Tiffany's.


""Be a good boy, Noah. Say Mommy!""


My son stumbled backward, terrified.


""No! She's not my mommy! My mommy's name is Selena!""


Helena's face twisted instantly. She pinched his arm hard.


""Don't talk nonsense! This IS your new mommy!""


Thomas glared coldly.


""Damian, is this how you're raising your son? No manners at all!""


Tiffany nestled into Damian's arms, pouting.


""Damian... does Noah hate me?""


Damian held her close, his voice soft and soothing.


""Of course not. He's just a kid—he doesn't know any better. Once we're married, you'll handle all his discipline. I won't interfere.""


I stood outside the door, watching this absurd scene unfold, and finally—I couldn't take it anymore.


Then I pushed the door open.


Every face in the room froze in shock as I smiled lightly.


""Family dinner, huh? Weird—how come nobody told me?""

One small coffee shop I worked with turned reviews into daily “customer quotes” on their menu board, then started posting those same quotes on social.

Another smart move is remixing UGC into storytelling. Instead of saying “look at this customer,” frame it like “here’s how Sarah used our product to fix this problem.” It shifts from vanity repost to mini case study.

But sometimes, I get the feeling that making him feel seen actually makes him feel uncomfortable. For example, I complimented him on some work he did on a project and said I appreciated how much he put into creating an experience for others. He is forever humble and tries to brush off the compliment a little as if he's minimizing his effort.  Over the last year, I've sprinkled compliments about his character, integrity, self awareness and musical talent when relevant.  You know how us ENFJs are, forever cheerleaders. But I do try to keep it a little low key for him because he seems a little uncomfortable with my expressiveness.  I'm just like that though. Bubbly, expressive, supportive. But I worry sometimes that maybe I'm being a bit much based on his awkwardness.  So, my question is... are y'all just kinda uncomfortable with compliments ?

1on3gyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stateshift/comments/1on3gyu/how_to_make_the_most_of_kubecon_a_practical_guide/,How to Make the Most of KubeCon: A Practical Guide for Developer Tools Companies,"Hey, folks,

Your team just booked a booth at[
KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-
america/). Someone forwarded you the exhibitor handbook. You're looking at
10,000+ attendees, hundreds of sponsors, and a price tag that's hard to
justify unless you generate real pipeline.

Most companies will spend the next few weeks obsessing over booth design and
swag. Then they'll show up, scan hundreds of badges, and follow up with
generic emails that go nowhere.

We've worked with dozens of developer tools companies through their first
KubeCon. The ones who generate actual pipeline…the ones who build
relationships that turn into customers six months later…they approach the
event completely differently.

## Why Most Companies Waste Their KubeCon Investment

Walk through the sponsor showcase during any KubeCon and you'll see the same
pattern. Booth staff standing behind tables, waiting for attendees to approach
them. When someone does walk up, the first question is usually about their
logging infrastructure or deployment pipeline. It feels like a sales pitch
within seconds.

By Wednesday afternoon, these teams have hundreds of badge scans. They'll
report back to leadership that the event was a success. Then they'll spend the
next month discovering that most of those contacts are students, people from
companies that will never buy, or developers who stopped by for the swag.

The problem isn't the event. KubeCon consistently delivers one of the best
concentrations of technical buyers in the industry. The problem is treating it
like a lead generation event when it's actually a relationship-building event.

The companies that succeed at KubeCon understand something fundamental:
developers and technical buyers don't want to be sold to at a conference. They
want to learn, connect with peers, and discover tools that solve real
problems. When you approach KubeCon with that mindset, everything changes.

## The Three-Phase Approach That Actually Works

Through our work with companies at various stages…from seed-stage startups to
Series B companies scaling their developer programs…we've identified a
systematic approach that consistently outperforms the standard ""show up and
scan badges"" playbook.

### Before the Event: Strategic Preparation Over Logistics

Most teams spend the week before KubeCon finalizing booth graphics and
ordering t-shirts. The teams who generate real results spend that time on
something different: strategic relationship mapping.

**Start by identifying 15-20 people you specifically want to meet**. These
should be potential customers, partners, or influential community members.
Reach out directly with a simple message:  ""We're building tools for container
security. I'd love to spend 15 minutes picking your brains while we're both at
KubeCon. Coffee Tuesday morning?""

This matters because everyone's calendar fills up once the event starts. If
you wait until Monday to schedule meetings, you're competing with hundreds of
other companies trying to do the same thing. The people you most want to talk
to will already be booked.

**Post on social media that you 're attending**. Not a corporate
announcement…just a genuine ""Who else is heading to KubeCon? Let's grab
coffee"" post. You'll be surprised how many people reach out.

For your booth team, preparation means something specific: training everyone
on how to start conversations naturally. The most common mistake we see is
booth staff who either wait passively for attendees to approach or immediately
jump into qualification questions.

**Develop a conversation framework**. Start with breaking the ice:  ""How's the
event going?"" or ""When did you fly in?"" Then move to light qualification:
""Tell me a bit about what you're working on."" Listen for signals that indicate
they match your ideal customer profile. Only then do you transition to
describing what you do.

Create a one-sentence description of your company that raises curiosity
without requiring technical background. This is harder than it sounds. Test it
with your team until everyone can deliver it naturally.

### During the Event: Relationships Over Transactions

When you first walk into KubeCon, the scale will feel overwhelming. Ten
thousand-plus people, hundreds of booths, dozens of simultaneous sessions. The
companies who generate value don't try to be everywhere…they focus on being
strategic about where they invest time.

**The social events matter more than most teams realize**. Every KubeCon has
multiple evening events, from small dinners to large receptions. Most are open
to anyone who registers. This is where relationships actually form.

People are more relaxed at evening events. They're not in ""conference mode""
where every conversation feels transactional. They're having a drink, talking
about the industry, sharing what they're struggling with. These conversations
lead to real relationships.

Make it a rule: no team dinners during KubeCon. Your team can have dinner
together any time. During the event, every evening should be spent at social
events or meeting with potential customers and partners.

**During the day, the hallway track matters more than the sessions**. We
consistently see that the companies who skip most talks to spend time in
conversations generate better results than those who sit through
presentations. You can watch talks later. You can 't recreate the hallway
conversations.

For your booth, the KubeCrawl is your highest-leverage time. This is when the
exhibition hall is most crowded, when people are specifically there to explore
booths. Yet we regularly see companies leave their booths empty during Cube
Crawl. They're tired, they want to get back to the hotel. This is exactly
backwards.

If you're operating a booth, being fully staffed and energetic during
KubeCrawl should be non-negotiable. This is when you'll have the most foot
traffic and the best opportunities for conversations.

When someone approaches your booth, follow this conversation framework:

**Step 1: Break the ice (30 seconds)**

  * ""How's the event going for you?""
  * ""When did you fly in?""
  * ""Catch any interesting talks yet?""
  * Keep it casual and human…no sales pitch

**Step 2: Light qualification (1-2 minutes)**

  * ""Tell me a bit about what you're working on""
  * Listen for signals that match your ideal customer profile
  * Ask about their role, company size, tech stack
  * If they're clearly not your customer, be direct about it

**Step 3: Understand their situation (2-3 minutes)**

  * ""What are you struggling with right now?""
  * ""What's your urgency to solve this?""
  * ""Who else is involved in these decisions?""
  * These questions feel natural but give you everything for follow-up prioritization

**Step 4: Offer value (5 minutes max)**

  * Only after qualifying them as a genuine prospect
  * ""Based on what you shared, I think we might be able to help with X, Y, Z""
  * ""Mind if I give you a quick five-minute overview?""
  * Focus on booking a real conversation after the event, not closing at the booth

![Kubecon lead qualifying conversation](https://blog.stateshift.com/wp-
content/uploads/2025/10/https___www.stateshift.com_book-visual-
selection-1-1024x620.png)

**What NOT to do:**

  * Don't start with ""How are you handling your logs/containers/security?""
  * Don't scan badges of people who aren't your customers
  * Don't launch into your pitch before understanding their situation
  * Don't try to close deals at the booth

For people who don't have a booth, the approach is simpler but requires more
initiative. Attend sessions where your ideal customers will be. Sit near
people, strike up conversations. Ask them what brought them to that talk.
Share what you're working on when it's natural.

Use lunch strategically. Don't eat alone or just with your team. Find a table
with people you don't know, introduce yourself, be genuinely curious about
what they're building.

The key mindset shift: you're not there to sell. You're there to meet people
who are solving similar problems, to learn about the space, to be helpful
where you can. Sales conversations happen later.

### After the Event: Speed and Prioritization

Most companies wait until the following Monday to start follow-up. This is too
late. By Monday, people are back in their normal routines, buried in email,
and the emotional connection from meeting you has faded.

**The right time to follow up is by end of week**. Friday, even Thursday if
you can manage it. People are still traveling home, the event is fresh in
their minds, and they 're more likely to respond positively.

But here's where most companies make the second mistake: they try to follow up
with everyone equally. If you collected 300 badge scans, that's 300 follow-up
emails to write. It's overwhelming and largely ineffective.

Instead, **prioritize based on qualification**. The people you had real
conversations with, who match your ideal customer profile, who expressed
genuine interest or shared a problem you can solve …these are your first-tier
follow-ups. Reach out personally within 48 hours while the conversation is
still vivid for both of you.

For second-tier contacts…people who might be a fit but weren't deeply
engaged…you can batch these into a more templated outreach the following week.
Be honest about the value exchange: ""We met briefly at KubeCon. Based on what
you mentioned about X, I thought this resource might be useful.""

For third-tier contacts who aren't really prospects, a simple connection on
LinkedIn is enough. Don't force a sales conversation where one doesn't exist.

One approach we've seen work well: before the event, schedule a workshop or
deep-dive session for the week after KubeCon. Make it invitation-only with
limited spots. At the booth, invite qualified prospects to register. This
gives you a natural next touchpoint that provides value rather than asking for
a meeting.

The key is maintaining the relationship momentum while emotional investment is
still high. Every day you wait, the logical side of someone's brain
rationalizes whether they really need to take that call. Act while they're
still excited about the conversation you had.

## What Success Actually Looks Like

The teams who approach KubeCon this way consistently generate different
outcomes. **Instead of 500 badge scans with a 2% response rate, they get 75
highly qualified conversations with a 40% conversion to follow-up calls**.

Six months later, when they track pipeline, they can connect deals back to
specific conversations at KubeCon. Not because they sold at the event, but
because they built authentic relationships with people who had real problems.

This matches what we see across our customer base. Companies that treat
conference attendance as relationship-building rather than lead generation see
measurably better ROI. The difference isn't in their booth design or their
swag…it's in their systematic approach to conversations, qualification, and
follow-up.

This systems-based approach is exactly what we focus on at **Stateshift**.  
We help developer tools companies design repeatable playbooks for events like
KubeCon — so every conversation, session, and social event ties back to a
clear developer growth strategy.  
Our clients use the same frameworks we apply to community and developer
advocacy: structure over guesswork, clarity over chaos, and consistent post-
event systems that actually generate pipeline.

If you want a deeper dive into how we help teams operationalize this kind of
approach, explore our guide on building [developer advocacy programs that
scale.](https://blog.stateshift.com/how-to-turn-developers-into-brand-
advocates-developer-advocacy/)

## Getting Started This Week

If you are reading this and KubeCon is next week, you still have time to shift
your approach:

**Map out 15 strategic people to meet and start reaching out today**. Even if
you only book three conversations, that 's three high-value relationships you
wouldn't have otherwise.

**Train your booth team on the conversation framework**. Practice it until it
feels natural. Make sure everyone understands that badge scans aren 't the
success metric…qualified conversations are.

**Identify the social events happening during KubeCon and make plans to
attend**. Block time in your calendar for these. Treat them as seriously as
you would a major customer meeting.

**Create your follow-up system now**. Know who will be responsible for first-
tier, second-tier, and third-tier outreach. Have templates ready so you can
execute quickly.

The companies that generate real value from KubeCon aren't doing anything
magical. They're being systematic about relationship-building in an
environment where most competitors are just trying to collect as many contacts
as possible. That systematic approach…treating every interaction as the start
of a potential relationship rather than a transaction…makes all the
difference.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **How many badge scans should we aim for at KubeCon?**

At Stateshift, we feel that badge scan volume is the wrong metric. Focus
instead on qualified conversations. A company with 50 badge scans from people
who match their ideal customer profile and had substantive discussions will
generate more pipeline than one with 500 random scans. Train your team to
qualify prospects through conversation before scanning badges, and prioritize
quality over quantity.

### **What 's the best way to stand out when there are 300+ other sponsors?**

You don't stand out through booth design or swag…you stand out through genuine
conversations. Most companies wait for attendees to approach or immediately
pitch their product. Start with ice breakers, ask about their work, and only
discuss your solution after understanding their challenges. This natural
approach makes you memorable when most vendors are transactional.

### **Should we attend talks or spend time networking?**

Networking delivers higher ROI at KubeCon. You can watch recorded sessions
later, but you can't recreate in-person conversations. Focus your time on the
hallway track, social events, lunches, and Cube Crawl. Companies that skip
most sessions to invest in conversations consistently generate better results
than those who prioritize attending talks.

### **How quickly should we follow up after KubeCon?**

Follow up with qualified prospects by end of week, ideally within 48 hours for
your highest-priority contacts. By Monday, people are back in normal routines
and the emotional connection has faded. Different tiers of contacts need
different follow-up speeds: personal outreach for qualified prospects
immediately, templated emails for second-tier contacts by the following week,
and simple LinkedIn connections for others.

### **What should booth staff do during Cube Crawl?**

Cube Crawl is your highest-leverage time at KubeCon. The exhibition hall is
most crowded and attendees are specifically there to explore booths. Ensure
your booth is fully staffed with your most engaging team members. Be proactive
about starting conversations, use your qualification framework, and treat this
as your prime opportunity for meaningful interactions. Never leave your booth
empty during this period.

### **How do we justify KubeCon costs if we 're bootstrapped?**

Focus your entire strategy on qualified pipeline rather than broad awareness.
Book strategic meetings before the event with potential customers. Skip
expensive booth additions and premium swag in favor of investing team time in
high-value conversations. Track qualified conversations and follow-up meetings
rather than badge scans. The ROI comes from 10-15 solid relationships that
turn into customers, not from general brand visibility.

OKAY well, I met someone. So, I run everyday. I was running early in the morning (6am ish) thru the city this past week on one of my regular routes (West Village-WSH), and I had a girl around me running at my pace and then a cute guy behind us but like at a bit of a distance.

So, I - obsessed with competition - tried to go faster than the girl and I stepped it up, but my immediate karma came thru and I tripped and I fell on the pavement rather bad and I got somewhat bruised up on both my left hand, leg and forearm (there was blood). One of my airpods flew off, but I didn't realize it initially.

The girl passed me, and then I got up and just shrugged it off and kept running. I eventually realized I was only listening to music from only one ear so I turned back to look for my airpod. As I was heading back, cute guy was coming thru making signs at me and shouting ""I HAVE IT! I HAVE YOUR AIRPOD!"" (I laughed). I thanked him, and then he looked at my arm and hand and he's like... ""You're bleeding...Do you want me to help you get that cleaned up?"" So we went to CVS together and got some antiseptic pads and band aids to clean up the wound and then got a coffee together and got to know each other a little, too.

He's hella cute, super nice (evidently) and I asked him out for a drink, on the spot. He said yes, and we went out this weekend and it was really nice! There was definitely a connection, and there's a second date coming soon. :)

So... Why am I sharing? I feel like people are desperate for connection (I am too). But I feel like the city will just take you to it. I know we're all busy grinding but I think that you gotta work with what you got and as long as you keep putting yourself out there, something will come!!

	•	My first few shots were a disaster — water basically couldn’t penetrate the puck.

	•	To fix that, I reduced the dose and now I’m barely tamping (just a very light press with two fingers).

	•	I’m using 16.5 g in and getting 45 g out. I know that’s on the longer side, but I’ve always preferred longer shots even with dark roasts.

	•	On my Sage Barista Pro, the first drops start around 10–11 seconds after pre-infusion, and the shot finishes around 45 seconds total (so about 35 seconds of flow time).


The last few shots have been… tolerable. Definitely drinkable, but still quite watery and lacking body. I realize that lighter roasts will always be less syrupy, but I’d still like to bring out more body and mouthfeel if possible.

So my question is:
What should I try next to improve this?

	•	Should I reduce the output ratio (e.g. closer to 1:2 instead of 1:2.7)?

	•	Grind finer again to slow it down?

	•	Tamp a bit harder?

	•	Or maybe something else entirely?


Any advice on how to optimize light roast espresso on the Barista Pro would be really appreciated!",1,1762146990.0,espresso,6,1.0,False
1on3do6,https://youtu.be/OE0ANZT15z4,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Night Fishing Horror Stories,"# ""Squid Light"":

I signed up for that squid fishing job because I needed the money. Back home in the northeast, things were tight, and the promise of a fat payout after two years at sea sounded like a way out. I had a girlfriend I wanted to impress, maybe start something real. My buddy Cui talked me into it—he was always chasing quick cash to fix his messes. We rushed through the paperwork, sat through a few days of safety lectures and navigation basics, and that was it. Before I knew it, I was standing on the deck of the *Lurongyu*, a trawler out of Shandong, the cold wind already biting my ears.

The captain, Li, was a tall man with a short fuse. He barked orders as we loaded up—sacks of rice, boxes of noodles, frozen meat, drums of oil, and those bright lamps meant to lure the squid from the deep. I brought extra smokes and instant food, figuring the ocean would get lonely.

We shoved off in late December, firecrackers popping along the dock, echoing against the harbor walls. The crew was a mixed bunch: a few from my province, some from Inner Mongolia who spoke their own dialect and stuck together, and officers from Dalian who acted like they owned the ship. Thirty-three of us total, crammed into bunks that smelled of rust, salt, and sweat.

The first weeks were hell. The sea never stopped rolling, and I threw up until I had nothing left to bring up. Nights blurred with the thrum of the engine and the slap of waves. When I wasn’t sick, I played low-stakes cards with Cui and a few others, dreaming about what we’d buy when we got back. Cui lost a bit, promised to pay me later.

There was this skinny guy from Heilongjiang, Liu. Always smoking. He had whole stacks of cartons stashed under his bunk. “This work’s miserable,” he’d mutter through the smoke. “But at least I control the cigarettes.”

By February, we hit the fishing grounds off Peru, and that’s when the real work began.

Nights were for jigging. We'd lower long lines baited with hooks, flood the water with those lamps until it glowed like liquid daylight, and wait for the squid to strike. When they did, the pull nearly tore your arms off—ten-pound bodies thrashing, spraying ink and seawater. We hauled until our backs screamed. Liu was the best—quiet, fast, methodical. He could bring in thousands of pounds a night without a word of complaint.

Unloading to the buyer ships was the worst. We'd go a day or two without sleep, stacking frozen trays in the hold until our fingers went numb. The captain pushed hard, shouting until his throat went hoarse. But the whispers started.

The pay wasn’t adding up. The contracts looked off—fake stamps, blurred signatures. Guys started saying we’d been tricked. Liu was the loudest. “We’re slaving for nothing,” he said one night in the mess, stirring noodles. “The company’s robbing us blind.” I nodded but kept quiet. Cui just laughed it off—said we’d deal with it when we got back.

Tension brewed like rot under the floorboards.

Xia, the cook, an older man who liked to drink and show off, sided with the captain and picked fights. One night, he mouthed off at a younger deckhand named Jiang. Jiang snapped, pulled a knife, shouting, “You think you’re better than us?” The captain stormed in, punched him down, made him kneel and apologize. “Too much drink,” Jiang muttered.

Liu spoke up, calm but firm. “Ease up, Captain.”

Li glared and walked off, but after that, Liu started talking quietly with a few men—Huang, a young kid from Mongolia, Bao from the same group, and others. I overheard bits of it while mending lines. “If we want to go home, we make it happen,” Liu said once.

By June, off the coast of Chile, the air was different. Heavy.

That night, I was on deck under the lamps when Liu came by. He picked up my squid knife, tested the blade, and said, “We’re taking the ship tonight. Join us?” His eyes were steady, unreadable.

I shook my head. “Not me.”

He said they’d put the non-joiners in rafts, call for rescue. Then he walked off with my knife.

My hands trembled on the line. I wanted to warn the captain, but the officers were asleep, and the deck felt watched. A few minutes later, I heard shouting—then a scream. The engine roared. Xia, the cook, rushed up waving a knife. “What are you doing?” he screamed. There was more shouting—then silence. When I came up later, there was blood on the deck. They said Xia fell overboard, but I knew better.

The mutineers—Liu, Jiang, Bao, Huang, and a few others—took over the bridge. They locked the weapons, chained the lifeboats, and forced Captain Li to steer for China. For weeks, it stayed calm. We crossed the Pacific, the men joking that we’d be home soon. “Say Xia slipped in a wave,” Cui whispered. But Liu grew more paranoid. He said fuel was low, engines failing, and rumors spread that the engineers were plotting to take the ship back.

Then came July.

One night, west of Hawaii, I was smoking in my bunk when Liu walked down the corridor, calling names. “Need help on deck.” Yue went first, then Liu Gang. Minutes later, screams—then splashes. Loud music from the helm, masking everything.

I froze, staring at the ceiling. Then I heard footsteps. The second officer stumbled in, bleeding. Liu followed, knife in hand. “Why are you on the floor?” he said, and stabbed him again. “Get up.” Another stab.

He turned to me, blood on his shirt. “You didn’t join at first,” he said softly. “But you’re my brother. You’re safe.”

I nodded. I didn’t breathe until he left. That night, they killed nine men—engineers Wen Dou and his cousin, Yue, Liu Gang, the second officer, Jiang Shutao, Chen, Wu, even Bo. Each mutineer had to take part. One by one, they dragged the bodies out and dumped them over the side.

By morning, the deck was scrubbed clean. I cooked breakfast like nothing happened. The air stank of bleach and iron.

Cui tried to comfort me. “We’re fine. They won’t touch us. We’ll be home soon.” But I saw how his hands shook.

Over the next days, men disappeared quietly—Ma one morning, gone without a trace. “He jumped,” Liu said. “He was my spy. No reason to kill him.” No one believed it.

Liu stopped sleeping. He made the captain sit beside him at meals. He checked every dish for poison, even watched me cook. His eyes were bloodshot, always scanning.

Then he changed course again—said we’d go to Japan, fake papers, call home for money. He made each of us phone our families, say we were sick, ask for 5,000 yuan. They sent what they could.

By the end, no one trusted anyone. Bao and his Mongolian men started whispering about overthrowing Liu. Huang told him. That night, Liu turned the captain into his ally. “You’ve killed too,” he told him. “You’re one of us now.”

He made a list of names.

At dawn, Bao was lured to the deck by Cui, told Liu wanted to talk. When he came up, the captain stabbed him from behind while Cui went for the chest. Bao screamed for his crew. But Liu’s men were waiting below. They called each Mongolian up by name—Dai, Shan, Qiu, Baocheng. Each one vanished into the dark. By sunrise, their bunks were empty.

Eleven of us left. All killers now, one way or another.

Liu drilled the story into us: “Blame the Mongolians. Say they fled in a raft.” He threatened our families if we told otherwise.

By August, the engines were dying. We drifted until the Japan Coast Guard spotted us. They towed us in, counted the crew, made calls. When Chinese police came, we told the lie, but it didn’t hold.

The trials came fast. Liu and Jiang got death. I got four years.

I served them quietly.

But even now, when I close my eyes, I hear the splashes. I see Liu’s smile in the dark, the ocean swallowing body after body.

Twenty-two men gone.

And somehow, I’m still afloat.





# ""Tides of Guilt"":

My mother and I shared a love for fishing—something passed down from my grandfather, who’d taught us both how to tie knots, bait hooks, and read the tide. She was always the cautious one: packing extra snacks, checking the weather twice, making sure I hadn’t forgotten the life vests. I was more confident, maybe too confident. That evening, as we loaded the boat at the marina, I caught her looking out at the horizon, the sky already bruising purple.

“Are you sure about going out so far tonight?” she asked. Her voice was calm but carried that edge I’d learned not to ignore.

“It’ll be fine, Mom,” I said, smiling as I tightened the last strap. “The water’s calm, we’ve got all the gear, and Block Canyon’s where the big tuna are this time of year.”

She hesitated, eyes tracing the darkening water, then sighed and climbed aboard. I fired up the engine, and we eased away from the dock around eleven, leaving the orange glow of the harbor behind.

The boat was my pride—a sturdy thirty-one-footer I’d spent months restoring. Just that afternoon, I’d made a few tweaks: removed the old trim tabs that weren’t doing much and patched up a few worn spots on the transom. A guy at the dock had watched me drill out the bolts, chewing on chips. “Hey, you sure that’s smart? Boat could take on water that way,” he’d said.

I’d laughed it off. “She’s solid. Don’t worry about it.”

Mom didn’t know about the modifications. She trusted me with the mechanical stuff. As we motored out, she settled into the cabin with her thermos, the smell of her coffee cutting through the diesel. “Tell me again why we’re not just staying closer to the island?”

“Because the big ones aren’t near the island,” I said with a grin. “We’ll catch something worth bragging about.”

We dropped our lines near Block Island around one in the morning. The sea was glassy, the air cool and still. Mom pulled in a small striper, laughing softly as it flicked water on her sleeve.

“Okay,” she said, smiling. “This isn’t so bad.”

But I wasn’t satisfied. “Let’s push to the canyon. Just a few more miles.”

She frowned. “I’ve got work tomorrow. Those kids depend on me.”

“It’ll be quick,” I promised. And, as usual, she relented.

The further we went, the lonelier the night became. The last of the shoreline lights vanished behind us, and the only sound was the hum of the engine and the rhythmic slap of waves. I checked the bilge pump once or twice—it was running fine.

We reached the canyon just before dawn. The water was deep here—hundreds of feet below us, dark and heavy. We baited our hooks with squid and cast our lines. Mom watched the sunrise quietly, the gold light catching in her hair. “This is peaceful,” she murmured. “But promise me we’ll head back soon.”

“I promise,” I said.

Then my line jerked hard. “Got one!” I shouted, bracing myself. But before I could reel, a deep grinding noise echoed from the stern. Metal on metal.

Mom turned, eyes wide. “What was that?”

I ran to check—and froze. Water was seeping in through the transom, slow at first, then faster.

“Mom, something’s wrong with the bilge,” I said, trying to sound calm. The pump was running, but it wasn’t keeping up. The deck felt soft under my boots—spongy where I’d patched it earlier.

Her voice tightened. “Can you fix it?”

“I—I don’t know.” My hands fumbled for tools, but the flow was too strong. “Grab the ditch bags,” I told her. “Now.”

The water climbed fast, sloshing around our ankles, then our knees. “We’re sinking?” she cried.

“Get the life raft ready!” I yelled, fumbling for the radio. Static hissed. I tried again—nothing. The boat lurched hard to one side. “Hold on!”

She was reeling in the last line, hands trembling. The next second, the deck tilted violently. I didn’t even have time to shout before the bow went under.

The plunge was instant. The ocean swallowed us whole. The cold hit like a wall of knives, knocking the air from my lungs. I surfaced, coughing, eyes stinging from salt. The boat was gone—just debris and the hiss of air escaping from somewhere below.

“Mom!” I shouted.

A flash of orange—a life raft inflating nearby. I kicked hard toward it, dragging one of the ditch bags behind me. Climbing in was agony; my limbs felt like lead. I turned, scanning the water. “Mom? Where are you?”

No answer. Just the empty roll of the sea.

“Mom!” I screamed until my throat went raw. I blew the whistle—three short blasts, over and over. Nothing but wind and water.

Had she gone under? Hit her head? The thought twisted my stomach. I leaned over the side, peering into the black water, but it was hopeless—the current was already carrying debris away.

Hours passed. The sun rose, bright and merciless. I rationed what little we had: a few packets of water, a couple of energy bars, and a hand pump for desalination. My lips split from salt, my hands blistered from gripping the raft ropes. Every few minutes I scanned the horizon. Once, I saw a ship—a distant speck—but my flares fizzled uselessly against the light.

Guilt gnawed at me. Why hadn’t I listened to her? Why had I pushed so far out? I could still hear her voice: “Are you sure about going out so far tonight?”

By the second night, the ocean felt alive. Things moved out there—splashes in the dark, faint shapes that disappeared when I looked straight at them. I clutched the knife from the emergency kit, whispering prayers I barely remembered. Sleep came in fragments, broken by dreams of her calling from beneath the water.

Days blurred. My skin cracked, my mind drifted. I talked to her voice in the wind, half-believing she was still close. Then came the storm—sheets of rain, the raft spinning like a leaf. I screamed for help, for forgiveness, for anything. Lightning split the horizon, showing only endless water.

On the eighth day, I saw it—a massive cargo ship. I waved the emergency flag, my arm trembling so hard I nearly dropped it. Someone shouted from the deck. A life ring hit the water. I swam toward it, muscles burning. Hands grabbed mine, pulling me aboard.

Wrapped in a blanket, I sat shivering as a crewman handed me water. “Your mother?” he asked gently.

I shook my head. Tears came without warning. “She’s gone.”

They called the Coast Guard, but I already knew. The sea had claimed her.

Even now, back on solid ground, I wake up hearing the water rushing in, the sound of her voice fading beneath the waves. The ocean keeps its secrets. And that night—it kept her.





# ""The Red Water"":

I decided to head out to the small lake behind my old family property that evening after work. The week at the warehouse had been brutal—long hours, sore shoulders, the kind of exhaustion that gnaws at your patience. Fishing was the one thing that always helped me reset. The lake was hidden deep behind the tree line, down a narrow dirt trail that wound through the pines. No signs, no trails on any map—just the way I liked it. I’d grown up casting lines there with my dad, but these days I usually went alone. My wife stayed home with the kids, and I promised I’d be back before ten.

I grabbed my rod, a small tackle box, and a flashlight, then drove the pickup to the edge of the woods. The sun had already dipped low, painting the horizon with streaks of orange and fading violet. The walk in took maybe fifteen minutes. The earth was soft from last night’s rain, and every step released the smell of damp pine and moss. Crickets screamed from the brush, and a few frogs croaked from somewhere out by the water.

When I reached the lake, it looked exactly as I remembered—still and black, ringed by trees so thick they swallowed the last bit of daylight. The air was cool, almost too still. I set up on a flat rock I’d used since I was a kid and baited my hook with a fat worm. The cast landed with a soft plunk that sent ripples across the glassy surface. For a while, it was peaceful. A fish tugged once or twice, but nothing serious. I was fine with that; it wasn’t about the catch tonight.

Then I noticed movement on the far side of the lake. At first, I figured it was a deer drinking, or maybe a raccoon scrounging by the shore. But as my eyes adjusted, I realized it was a person. A man. He stood knee-deep in the shallows, hunched over something metallic. After a few seconds, I saw it clearly—a large metal drum. He tipped it forward, pouring out a thick stream of liquid that hit the water with a low, gurgling sound.

The color caught the last of the light—dark, almost black, with a reddish tint.

Oil? Paint?

Something worse?

The smell carried faintly across the lake, sharp and metallic. I cupped my hands around my mouth and shouted, “Hey! What are you doing over there?”

The figure froze mid-motion. Slowly, he turned his head toward me. I couldn’t see his face, but I felt his stare, heavy and cold. After a beat, he straightened up, grabbed the drum, and trudged out of the water into the trees without a word.

My pulse quickened. Why run if it was nothing?

I stood there a minute longer, scanning the opposite shore, but the dusk had thickened into full dark. My fishing line bobbed once, then went still. I reeled in fast, packed my gear, and slung the rod over my shoulder.

Halfway back to the truck, I heard a branch snap off to my left. I stopped. The beam from my flashlight swept across tangled underbrush and dripping leaves. Nothing moved.

“Anyone there?” My voice sounded too loud in the quiet.

No answer. Just the chirring of crickets and my own breathing. I started walking faster. Then another crack—behind me this time. I spun around, light cutting through the darkness. For a split second, I thought I saw movement—something slipping behind a tree. My stomach twisted. I jogged the rest of the way, keys already in hand.

By the time I slammed the truck door shut, my hands were trembling. I locked the doors, headlights cutting a white tunnel through the forest road. I didn’t stop until I was back on the paved highway.

At home, my wife was cleaning up after dinner. I told her what I’d seen—kept my voice light, tried to sound casual. “Probably some idiot dumping waste,” I said. “I’ll call the environmental people tomorrow.”

She frowned, setting her dish towel down. “That’s not normal, though. You sure it wasn’t something else?”

“Yeah,” I said, though the image of that red liquid still burned in my head. “It’s fine. I’m fine.”

We ate late. The kids were already asleep upstairs. Around midnight, I was lying awake, replaying the scene over and over—the way he’d turned, the stillness in him, the red that wasn’t quite red. The thought hit me like a shiver: what if it wasn’t paint?

Then came a knock at the door.

Three slow, deliberate thuds.

My wife stirred beside me. “Who could that be this late?” she whispered.

I grabbed my phone—no missed calls—and slipped into jeans. Another knock, this time softer, from the side window near the kitchen.

I crept downstairs, bathed in the weak glow of the porch light. I peered through the curtain. Nothing. Then a voice, low and calm, floated through the glass.

“Excuse me. I think you saw me at the lake earlier. I’d just like to explain myself.”

My blood went cold.

How the hell did he know where I lived?

“Who are you?” I called out. “How did you find me?”

No answer. Then: “Sir, if you could just open the door, I can explain everything. It won’t take long.”

My wife appeared halfway down the stairs, pale and wide-eyed. “Don’t,” she mouthed.

“Leave now, or I’m calling the police,” I said, louder.

A pause. Then footsteps crunching on gravel, fading toward the road.

I called it in. The dispatcher said they’d send a patrol to check. We waited upstairs, lights on, every creak in the house making my heart jump. The officers arrived, did a quick sweep, said they found nothing. “Probably some prank,” one of them said. “Lock up tight.”

I tried to believe that. I really did.

But around two a.m., glass shattered downstairs.

My wife screamed. I bolted upright, grabbed the bat from under the bed. “Stay here,” I told her. “Call 911.”

I crept down, feet bare against the cold floor. The kitchen window was smashed, the curtain fluttering in the wind. Footsteps creaked on the stairs—slow, steady.

He was coming up.

When the door to the hall swung open, I saw him clearly for the first time. Short, solid build. Beard. Glasses. Black flannel shirt. The same man from the lake. His right hand held a knife that caught the faint hall light.

“You shouldn’t have yelled at me,” he said quietly. “Now I have to make sure you don’t tell anyone.”

I tightened my grip on the bat. “Get out,” I growled.

“It’s too late for that.”

From upstairs, my wife’s voice cracked through the air. “Police are coming!”

He hesitated, head tilting slightly, listening. Sirens wailed faintly in the distance.

Then he lunged.

I swung hard. The bat connected with his arm with a sickening crack. He dropped the knife but rammed into me, both of us crashing into the wall. We struggled—grunts, broken glass, picture frames hitting the floor. I kneed him hard, shoved him back toward the window.

He stumbled, snarled, “This isn’t over,” then vaulted through the broken frame, slicing his hand open on the glass. The sound of his footsteps faded into the dark.

The police arrived minutes later. They found blood on the sill, a trail leading into the woods. I told them everything—about the lake, the drum, the red liquid.

The next day, they found fresh tire tracks near the far shore. No drum. No containers. But in the mud, a partial boot print matched one from my kitchen floor. The blood sample came back two days later: Robert Kline, local butcher, prior assault charges, lived two towns over.

When they caught him hiding in a shed, he claimed he’d only been dumping animal waste. But the knife from my kitchen floor told another story—it carried traces of both human and animal blood, old and new. The investigation widened: missing pets, unclaimed remains, an unsolved hiker disappearance years ago near the same lake.

He took a plea deal—fifteen years. I testified at the hearing. When I asked him why he came after me, he just smiled and said, “You saw too much.”

We sold the family land soon after. I don’t fish alone anymore, not at night.

Sometimes, when the wind’s just right, I still think I hear that low gurgle of liquid hitting water. And I wonder—was he really working alone?

The lake’s still there, hidden and quiet. But every secret eventually floats back to the surface.





# ""The Last Cast"":

We both worked desk jobs in the city, staring at screens for hours until our eyes burned and our shoulders ached. It felt like life was just passing under the hum of fluorescent lights. So when Chris suggested biking across parts of the country—stopping at rivers to fish along the way—it sounded perfect. Open roads, quiet water, and no deadlines. I hadn’t felt that kind of excitement in years.

In June 1977, we set out from Portland with two bikes, a tent, and a couple of rods strapped to our frames. For days we pedaled through Oregon’s backroads—past wheat fields shimmering in the wind, pine-covered hills, and empty rest stops that smelled of dust and rain. By the time we reached a small state park tucked along a winding river, our legs were shot, but the sight of the water revived us. The river was clear and fast, curling around boulders with deep pools where trout might rest.

We locked our bikes to a cedar and unpacked near the bank. Chris, always the optimist, pointed his rod at the water. “They say this river’s full of fish,” he said. “Tonight, we’re eating fresh.”

I laughed, threading my line with a fly. “Let’s make it quick before it gets dark.”

The first hour was pure calm. The air smelled of wet moss and cedar. Fireflies hovered over the shallows. Chris caught a small trout—silver, slick, fighting with everything it had. He grinned like a kid, held it up for me to see, then released it.

But as dusk deepened, something shifted. The woods went unnaturally still. Somewhere behind us, a twig snapped. Then another. I turned, shining my flashlight toward the trees. Just branches, shadows, and the faint rustle of leaves.

“Probably a deer,” I muttered.

Chris hesitated. “Or someone else fishing. Hello out there?”

Silence.

We shrugged it off and kept casting, though neither of us said much after that. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. It wasn’t just nerves—something was out there. The kind of quiet that makes your heartbeat sound too loud.

When the bites stopped coming, we packed up and crawled into the tent. Chris stretched out on his sleeping bag. “Good call on this spot,” he said, zipping the flap shut. “Peaceful. No crowds.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Too peaceful.”

He laughed softly, and soon we were talking about routes, about the next stretch south. But our voices trailed off, and sleep crept in.

That’s when the night split open.

An engine roared to life somewhere nearby—loud, guttural, and angry. Gravel spun under tires. The sound grew fast, closer, until headlights washed over the thin fabric of our tent.

“What the hell—?” Chris sat up, but before he could move, the truck lunged forward.

The impact crushed us flat. The world became noise—metal and canvas ripping, bones snapping. My chest caved, my breath vanished. I screamed, or thought I did, but it was drowned out by the engine’s roar. The truck reversed, tires spitting dirt, then slammed into us again.

When it stopped, there was only the ticking of the engine cooling. Then a door creaked open. Footsteps approached—slow, deliberate.

Through torn fabric, I saw him: a man silhouetted by starlight. Broad shoulders, cap low on his head. In his hand, something glinted—a long-handled axe, edge catching the faintest shine.

“Please,” Chris gasped beside me. “Please don’t—”

The man didn’t speak. He raised the axe and brought it down. Once. Twice. The sound was thick and final, like a log splitting. Chris thrashed, screamed. The man struck again, each swing deliberate, brutal.

“Stop!” I shouted, dragging myself up, reaching for him. Pain tore through my ribs. The axe turned toward me. He swung—caught my arm. I felt the bone crack, white-hot pain flooding my vision.

I rolled, gasping, the next swing grazing my side. My hand hit mud and glass. I kicked weakly, screaming for help that wouldn’t come.

He stood over me, breathing hard. For a moment, I thought he was done. Then he wiped the blade on his jeans, turned, and walked back to his truck. The door slammed. The engine started. He drove off slow, as if satisfied.

Silence fell. The smell of gasoline and blood hung thick in the air.

“Chris?” I whispered. “Hey… come on.”

No answer. I touched his shoulder. Still warm. No movement.

Something inside me cracked—not just ribs, but something deeper. I crawled from the wreckage, dragging myself toward the faint shimmer of the road. My limbs didn’t feel real anymore—just pain and dirt and survival. Thorns tore my hands, my face. The park seemed endless.

Then, at last, the hiss of tires. Headlights swelled. I stumbled into the beam, waving weakly.

A car screeched to a stop. A woman’s voice cried out, “Oh my God!”

“Attacked…” I croaked. “My friend’s still back there…”

The driver, a man, ran toward the campsite with her. Minutes blurred. They came back carrying Chris, pale and soaked in blood. “He’s alive,” the man said. “Barely.”

Sirens followed—the kind you hear in dreams. Paramedics shouting, lights flashing. I remember hands on me, a mask, a needle. Then darkness.

When I woke in the hospital, days had passed. My arm was in a cast, ribs bound, tubes running from my chest. Chris was in the next room. They said he survived, but with brain damage—lost an eye, partial memory. He barely spoke.

Police came with notebooks and questions. I told them what I saw: the truck, the shape of the man, the sound of his voice—though I couldn’t make out words. They found the tire tracks, the torn tent, the blood—but no weapon, no prints, no suspect.

Years later, I went back. I couldn’t help it. The town hadn’t changed much—same diner, same gas station. In the police archives, one name kept surfacing: a local ranch hand with a violent streak. Assault charges, dropped each time. When I saw him once, crossing Main Street, I froze. His face—it was the one I remembered from the shadows. Cold. Unbothered.

The statute of limitations had long expired. Nothing anyone could do.

Chris and I drifted apart not long after. Some wounds heal wrong, some never do. I still wake up some nights hearing that engine revving in the dark, headlights bleeding through canvas.

Wednesday we had to move hotels from the corporate one over to Hotel Monteleone. We loved this hotel, it was quiet and had good soundproofing (the Sheraton did not), the beds were super comfy and the service was wonderful. 

We got lunch at Cafe Fleur de Lis, and then hopped on our Cajun Encounters Swamp Tour (small boat option). Had a great tour, saw lots of birds and alligators. 

We had an epic dinner at Palm & Pine. Our waiter was incredible, she felt like a personal cheerleader for our meal. The food was amazing, we think this was the best meal of the trip and that's saying a lot because all of our meals were delicious. We then went over to Mahogany Jazz Club for a music set. 

Thursday we explored the Garden District. Started the day at Cafe Beignet. Took the streetcar to Skeleton House, then walked Audubon Park. Shopped Magazine Street, looked at old houses and peaked in the cemetery before dinner at Coquette. Finished the night at Pat O'Brien's piano bar. 

Friday (Halloween) we slept in, then went to Cafe du Monde for beignets. Walked around Jackson Square, did some shopping. Did the Sazarec House tour and got free samples, then took the ferry to Algiers. Got a late lunch at Barracuda Taco Stand and a drink at Crown & Anchor. Back to the city to get our costumes on, then wandered Bourbon and Frenchmen with the masses. Got a Purple Drank at Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, and a monsoon at Port of Call. Walked thru the Frenchmen art walk, got a late night ice cream at Sucre. 

Saturday started with Cafe Beignet for breakfast, then to Erin Rose for the frozen coffee drink. Went to the sculpture garden in City Park, and the art museum. Had dinner at Toup's Meatery before going to Preservation Hall for a jazz set. Sweet Saint for ice cream after, then over to Fritzel's for more live music. Ended the night at the Carousel Bar in our hotel. 

Sunday we walked around and shopped a bit more before doing the jazz brunch at Mr. Bs Bistro. Really lovely meal. Got the Hand Grenade from Tropical Isle as our last drink on the way out to the airport. 

I think the main things I would change would be to book a couple more restaurant reservations earlier (I waited because I couldn't make up my mind on where to eat and then they weren't available anymore), and on Halloween I would have booked a show at Snug Harbor instead of just wandering around and going into bars for music. We would have also considered Ubering instead of the streetcar because both times we did that it was super slow. With limited time on some of the days (like the art museum closing at 5) that would have saved us some time. 

Overall it was an awesome trip!",4,1762146674.0,AskNOLA,0,1.0,False
1on3ash,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1on3ash/caffeine_addiction_since_childhood_any_chance_to/,Caffeine Addiction Since Childhood - Any Chance To Recover Dopamine System?,"Hi everyone!
I wanted to ask about your experience with caffeine addiction.

Overall, I recently became curious about the origins of my own caffeine dependence. If I go all the way back, it probably started from the very day I was born. During childbirth, the midwife injured the muscles in my neck, and I couldn’t hold my head up until I was one year old. My mom carried me to daily massages throughout the first year of my life. Everything is fine now.

When I was two, my parents divorced because my father couldn’t handle the stress of his business and started drinking instead of earning money. My mom didn’t have enough money even for my baby formula. She divorced him and moved in with her mother. My grandmother was extremely authoritarian. From age five to ten, I lived with her in a small village and only saw my mom once a year.

When I was eleven, my mother married my stepfather, who was twenty years older than her. He turned out to be a very controlling and authoritarian man. We couldn’t get along because he demanded complete obedience from me and constantly threatened to throw my mom and me out of the house if I didn’t behave the way he wanted. I was basically locked at home for six years — until I finished school. I wasn’t allowed to go out, had to report every time I left the house, my homework was checked daily, and there was constant distrust. I wasn’t allowed to look pretty — otherwise, I’d “bring shame to the family.” There was just so much control. I still can’t forgive my parents for my ruined childhood.

When I entered university, it was, so to speak, “the beginning of the end.” Alcohol, cigarettes — I wanted to try everything that had been forbidden for so long. I couldn’t focus on studying and spent all my time partying and using various substances. I think that’s when my dopamine system started to break down. Later, behavioral addictions joined in as well.

Now I’m trying to overcome my caffeine addiction because I feel that caffeine has damaged my dopamine system. From what I understand, the birth trauma I experienced probably predisposed me to anxiety and certain psychological patterns from the start, and my authoritarian, hyper-controlling parents only made things worse. Now I constantly feel like the world is waiting for a moment to trip me up.

How does this connect to coffee?
I first tried it as a child, in elementary school — around six to eight years old — and it was love at first sip. By the age of twelve, I was drinking it regularly because it felt like my only source of joy in a world where everything was forbidden to me. It’s still that way, except that recently alcohol has joined in. (I’ve always tried to avoid drinking too much because my biological father died of a heart attack related to alcoholism.) But lately, I just can’t handle even a normal level of stress anymore.

I don’t want to do anything. After work, all I want is to come home and mindlessly scroll through social media. I know it’s destructive, but I can’t seem to stop. I feel like starting caffeine so early (I’m 30 now) might have damaged my dopamine system. Maybe I started using coffee to cope with negative experiences — my parents’ divorce, my mother’s departure, birth trauma — and ended up unknowingly getting myself hooked on a drug.

My question to those who might know:
Do you think there’s a chance for me to restore my dopamine system and start living like a normal person? Could this constant desire to just scroll after work, because nothing else brings joy, be a sign of a broken dopamine system?
I suspect I have an overly sensitive psyche and react too strongly to things, but I’d really like to hear opinions from others — maybe from people with more experience.",2,1762146648.0,decaf,9,1.0,False
1on3arp,https://yuhotel.blogspot.com/2025/10/W.html,Hotel Stay Experience : W Macau,"I think many people would be interested in reading about this hotel. Many have heard of it, but few have stayed there. This luxurious yet mysterious accommodation is quite alluring. 

The brand clearly positions itself as luxury, but it achieves this not through the accumulation of gold but through a chic blend of black and white with stylish fashion. This concept is reflected in the hotel’s architecture, lobby, bar, elevators, corridors, bedrooms, and bathrooms, with every detail exuding this vibe.

During check-in, the staff informed me that I had been upgraded to a room with a better view. Initially, I thought it wouldn’t be anything special. However, once I entered the room, I was immediately struck by the breathtaking view—such high ceilings and enormous floor-to-ceiling windows, resembling a luxury apartment in a skyscraper.

From the room, I could see almost all of Macau’s landmarks, including the Parisian, the Eiffel Tower nearby, and the Grand Lisboa in the distance, along with glimpses of the Lisboa and Venetian. It truly felt like the entire earth was beneath my feet.

One of the key elements in building the W brand is its iconic letter ""W,"" which is simple yet clear. The ""W"" in Macau is right downstairs, reflecting beautifully against the hotel's backdrop. Even with a typhoon approaching, and the letter wrapped in tape, it still couldn’t hide its extraordinary brilliance.

Fortunately, when I visited last week, before the tape was applied, I took a photo that I can now use for this post. 

This hotel room has a charm; without any ostentatious elements, it still conveys a sense of noble elegance. A mirror, a coffee cup, or even a trash can makes you want to take a picture. 

Some say a home shouldn't resemble a hotel too much. This statement seems simple but has profound implications. Indeed! If a hotel feels just like home, traveling would be rather dull. However, if a hotel is as comfortable as home, traveling can be much more enjoyable.

Perhaps W Hotel has found a balance between the two; that’s how I feel about it, at least for this location in Macau.",1,1762146647.0,marriott,0,0.67,False
1on3a3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1on3a3a/curious_friend/,Curious Friend?,"Ill start this by saying, i feel like I sometimes read into things tooooo much lol. In the past, my gaydar has NEVER failed me. Even with the guys who bailed and turned back “straight” at the last min. I still had AMPLE proof in my mind that they were at least curious. But I have this friend ive known for over 10 years. We aren’t SUPER close but we talk maybe once every few months. In high school he was the nerdy kid, ive always been attracted to the nerdy kids that nobody talked to. Idk why, i was the popular 
chubby kid in school. 

But anyway, we really got closer after high school , we would have great convos through text, hours of texting and smiley faces, he supported me and checked in on me at some of the hardest times of my life, and i feel like even when my messages started creeping into gay territory , he never responded like the average “straight guy” would being offended or weird. With that being said, one day I decided to try my luck. We linked up just to hang and we were on my couch watching anime when I laid on his shoulder. It lasted for a few min but it felt soooo nicee. He didnt move or act weird about it at all. In fact, it felt like he didnt mind. We continued to watch the show while I caressed his arm, not too much, but deff not in a straight “bro way” after enough sus messages, mostly on my end, i decided to ask him about it and how he felt about me laying on his arm. he told me hes into girls and I apologized which of course was awkward, but oh well. Nothing changed, he didnt act different, but we stopped talking as much and maybe a couple years went by. I would reach out randomly and we would briefly talk, or I would run into him in public and just quickly chat but nothing more. 

Now…in my mind, when he sees me, he thinks of the fact that I made an advance toward him and he KNOWS that im interested in him, no way he doesn’t remember that right? Haha. Anyways, recently we begin texting again, he offers this time, to go out for coffee, which he NEVER did before. I accept and he says he will follow up to let me know when. Fast forward a couple months later, he calls me, randomly around 8-9pm, and strikes conversation. To me, that meant he was thinking about me LMFAOOO. Is that delusional?? Hahaha. Hes super nervous, imo, so am I, but we talk for a little about things we’ve already texted about but it was still nice to talk otp because we NEVER do that, lol, but I could tell that he really wanted to talk to me, and I did too. He offers to setup the coffee meet and seemed super excited to do so. He also tells me that he recently broke up with his girlfriend , which surprised me, but he didnt say anything else about it after. Im not sure if i just like him so much and want it to be what I want it to be, or if its a sign that he may be interested. I just dont see a straight guy setting up a coffee date out of the blue with someone who has made advances on them. Am I just delusional or is something there? Lol please dont be mean.

It was a long period of the divorce too cause there was properties and money, but we kept in contact while I was working away and every so many months I come down and we see each other. This beautiful is amazing. This is the first woman I’ve actually ever been attracted to so I ended up moving down and getting everything sorted moved in to our house. We seeing each other then apparently she got kicked out of the place she was in so she moved in with me. It was amazing. We could make love have sex. She used to say make love whenever we wanted and we went out and spent time together so amazing. It was good and I was so happy then we had to move out of the place we were in and we ended up going to a apartment block, we could stay in there for basically everything was great. I was working she couldn’t work because apparently she had health issues so I work 1012 hour days brought in 2 1/2 $3000 a week paid for everything for her for us coffee sex trips fishing things like that, but I’d ask her to go out let’s go out for dinner. No I don’t feel like I don’t want to. I just wanna stay at home so I’d cook romantic dinners every now and again try and spice it up a bit go to. to her at night now issues having sex and that went on for a long time then she rang me after a couple years. I know it’s a couple of the things in between that I didn’t that were red flags at the time, but because I was so in love with her, I let go like selfies and things like that asking her what she done for the day or whatever and nothing just shopping a phone call and she says that she’s late with her period and I was like no you couldn’t be because every time we did do it which wasn’t very often to three times a month maybe if that I always pulled out way before yeah we didn’t use protection, but I pulled out way before and then we ended up getting pregnancy test and she was pregnant. She wanted a abortion I didn’t want to, but was half about it cause I didn’t want kids. I think the decision was to have the baby nine months went through was great sex all the time. Happy dinners at home obviously for dinners. Had the baby come home the day that we come home from hospital she wanted to masturbate so we did then it was always. I don’t feel like it my hormones, blah blah blah all of that stuff just let it go didn’t worry about it was nurturing her and through postnatal depression that I thought she had and all the other stuff of first time, mum I’d have kids before, so I knew what to do so I was helping out be up at 4:30 in the morning home by five feed cook dinner get up at 13 in the morning. Feed the little baby then I noticed once she went to her doctors appointment she took her make up with her so when she got up the door, take your make up. oh she’s the doctors touching my face that was a red flag. I just let go then the accusations of me cheating me being a cheater and I look at other women and I don’t love her. I’m not in love with her getting accused of having a threesome with my boss and people that know me know that I would never cheat and never do anything like that and that went on for a long time. I tried to calm and everything like that but yeah, just got worse and worse and worse to the point where we were I just lost it. I fired up yep pretty badly because she was the love of my life and please got called a couple of times that happened all of that sort of stuff. This went on for about five years from time we started to the time she packed up and left. I was devastated crying all that stuff to come back. I’ll make it better but this she moved back in and within a week it started again, cheating this I started smoking behind her back smoke some other stuff behind her back, I was stressed all the time trying to nurture her and do everything I could to show her my love and everything like that then talking on the phone when I went to work so it always write a two page essay of how much I loved her in the morning 1 o’clock get a message. Our journey is over. See you later. Bye when back she stayed where she was at a family friends place that went on for 1617 months. She lived there while she was still with me while I was giving her money everything like that i’d take the child over the weekend and sometimes during the weekdays and everything like that then I got really suspicious with a few things confront her did a few searches and lost my shit at her again because I knew she was cheating on me. I knew she was cheating on me the whole time, but didn’t wanna see it so that’s it. She rang me. That’s it where you a loser, blah blah blah all of this sort of stuff try to get back with her love you all of this then I was living in a tent for a while because I was homeless because I was going through a nervous mental breakdown because of all of this and the accusations and everything like that then basically went through that for a little while given her plenty of money child support child was going in daycare three days a week so I was paying for that too on top of childcare nearly thousand dollars a week sometimes then I went and seen a escort because I knew she was cheating. She was seeing some other man so I thought you know what I’m just gonna do. I haven’t had sex you know 16 months and she caught me on the phone. I didn’t delete the number and she was devastated. She was oh God that was kick me out because I used to put the child to sleep at night time to drive 45 minutes each way so she could have her rest then that was it done seen the child for the weekend. I was devastated everything like that then I questioned whether the child was mine and I’d had done that through the whole period of the time we were together, but didn’t wanna see it happen three years or raise that child then long story short a few things happen. She set me up with a few things ended up that’s it done dusted all over and done with got the child taken away from me from her because I was too dangerous because I was abusive. It was just my mental health with everything didn’t get to see if the child was mine and then moved to my parents had a lot of time on my own so I started doing research and I researched every app everything like everything archives spent thousands of dollars and come across a forum at whatever it is she was a fan only some sort of sex worker that sells videos, her own online shop their own other Work that she done that in the six years she never worked and yeah, the whole thing just absolutely destroyed me mentally emotionally physically lost my job everything and she’s sitting in a house getting having sex every night with a child that isn’t mine cause she won’t give me the answer didn’t get the DNA done in time and sitting on well there a lot of money because it works out the six years we were together she’s been working the whole time sleeping with humorous amounts of men getting filmed and selling them online plus shops toy shops like and I couldn’t even look at another woman. I wasn’t even allowed to play with Her. I wasn’t even allowed to go down on her couldn’t even do doggy style nothing but what I seen in the videos and the blogs and the oh God she’s pretty much a escort and now I just found out I got all the evidence everything like that and I don’t know what to do. I’m homeless no money no job I didn’t want to be on this earth. Any more nearly happened and her whole family and friends think I’m this abusive horrible person when it was the other way around and I don’t know what to do with all of this now, don’t know I want some sort of compensation. I paid 60 $70,000 in a couple in 18 months to two years while she was working and making plenty more than what I was with other stuff as well. The point is cheating on somebody. I was heartbroken. She was the love of my life. We’re gonna get married. We’re engaged had a baby. I’m still heartbroken. Wake up every morning crying but now I found all of this out speechless for the 56 years we were together she was cheating on me the whole time playing me and I’ve seen bits and pieces but I didn’t cause I was so in love so what would what would people do? What would people out there do at this situation? Do you leave it? Do you sue her for the money? Do you expose her because I don’t wanna be where I am at the moment in this state. I want a big payout and I’d want 100,000+ car and just pack up and leave. That’s what I wanna do. What are your thoughts? ",5,1762146453.0,cheating_stories,4,1.0,False

The earliest mugs date back over 12,000 years, made from carved wood, bone, and clay. Once pottery and kilns emerged, ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Romans crafted ceramic and metal mugs though without handles.

Handles became common in medieval Europe, when potters realized that a sturdy grip made for a better beer experience. By the 18th century, porcelain mugs became a household staple, prized for their beauty and insulation.

Today, mugs are more than vessels they’re tiny canvases of self-expression, from ironic quotes to handmade art. Whether it’s your morning coffee or late-night tea, that humble mug has a long, cozy story behind it.",1,1762146422.0,ironicmugs,0,1.0,False

## [Route 2 - The Dying Bird]

At first there was sunlight.

It spilled across the window of the small home that Saaka shared with her husband, the new trainer whose laugh always came before the morning coffee.  The air smelled of soil and roasted beans; the cups were chipped, but they matched.  For the first time in years she could say the word home without tasting metal.

> “You’re going to be late again,” she teased.
“Then I’ll just run faster,” he said, grin bright as glass.

She wrote his name at the top of a letter—Ryo—and folded it into her journal, just because she liked the look of it in ink.

Days blurred.  Training matches, laughter, little notes left on the kitchen wall.  She began teaching him the old research methods; he tried to teach her how to breathe again.  She told herself the pain in her head was nothing, that the trembling in her hand would fade.

It didn’t.

At first, it was small: forgetting a date, a word, a number. Then the sounds began to dull, as if her world were slipping under water.  She wrote everything down—recipes, names, dreams—but the letters no longer stayed still.  The disease is in my mind now, she realized.  It’s rewriting me.

One morning she awoke and the bed beside her was warm, but she couldn’t remember whose warmth it was.

> “Saaka,” someone said softly.  “You should rest.”

She turned.  The face there shimmered, the outline trembling.
“Who… are you?”

Silence.  A heartbeat.  A voice breaking.

> “It’s me sweetie, Ryo.”

The sound came out fragmented, as though each syllable were scraped by static:

> “It’s m… ▇▇▇▇▇.”

Her notebook slipped from her fingers.  She read the words she had written the night before—each line fractured:

> Today ▇ smiled at me again.
We ▇▇▇▇▇ training ▇▇▇ garden.
I love ▇▇▇▇▇.

She tried to cry but the memory of why was gone.

The hous▇ became quieter.  The birds outside stopped ▇isiting, or maybe she just cou▇dn’t hear them anymore. Some▇▇mes she sat at the win▇▇w and spoke to the empty chair across from h▇r.

> “▇▇▇▇▇, the flowers are blooming again.”

The name felt wrong on her to▇gue, as though it no long▇r belonged to her mouth.
The photographs on the wall blurred; the colo▇s bled together. She tr▇▇ed the shapes with her fingers, whispering, him… mine… husband… until the words lost t▇▇ir mean▇ng.

Entry — no d▇te:

> the ▇▇nd sounds like you
I think you said ▇▇od morning b▇t it c▇me out ▇▇▇▇▇
I tried to answer b▇t the letters ran away
I am ▇▇ tired
I am so ▇▇▇▇▇

She began h▇ming to fill the silence.  ▇he t▇▇e was the one he used to whis▇le on the way to the a▇ena. When her voi▇▇ cracked, she pretended the echo that answered was hi▇.

> “You’re ▇oing fine,” the echo wh▇▇pered.
“Just rest a li▇▇le longer.”

“Don’▇ go,” she mur▇▇red.  “Plea▇e, don’t ▇▇▇▇▇.”

> “I’m ▇ere,” it s▇▇d.  “Alw▇▇s.”

Days fo▇▇▇d into light.  Or maybe i▇ was years.  The noteb▇▇k filled with m▇aningless ma▇ks.  Her own ▇ame began to slip.

> My ▇ame is S… Sa… ▇▇▇▇▇.

One eve▇▇ng, the sky o▇▇side tu▇▇ed the same ▇ale col▇r as her skin.  She pressed her forehead to the ▇▇ol glas▇, watc▇▇ng the wo▇▇d blur.

5'1, white, petite. I usually prefer to go by they/them pronouns. 

looking for folks downtown Toronto to vibe with, aged 28-40(ish) 

I'm looking for connection with emotionally available people - be it romantic or casual, or just friend vibes. 

I finished grad school and now work in the mental health field. Yes, I will ask you about your feelings. I have moved into my own place recently, and am looking to balance my need for quiet introspection with the warmth of company.  I would also love reasons to get out and explore more, and also host people to drink tea and possibly cuddle. 

Sober-leaning, into indie/emo/rock concerts, karaoke, museums, art galleries, getting coffee and going for walks, reading, philosophy, intentionality, trying to make the world better, rock climbing - top-rope and bouldering, camping, hiking, running, cycling,  the occasional rave, and not using AI to craft my interpersonal communications.  You too? 

Somewhat more of a homebody these days, but I have an adventurous streak in me that veers its head from time to time.  

   
In others I'm looking for traits of stability, levelheaded and grounded, balanced with the right amount of openness and receptivity to trying new things and going new places - people who know when it's the right time to say ""fuck it"" and find ourselves at an all night dirt rave in the middle of the DVP.  For example. Without shirking any of our really important responsibilities.  Recklessness is not hot to me. 

Looking to wander around, take day trips out of the city, and maybe kiss in wooded. 

I'm connected to some Buddhist communities. Mindfulness, self-compassion and grounded awareness are important to me. I'd prefer you were open to those things if not actively practicing. 

I am open to something long term and serious but also happy just to vibe - see how things develop naturally. I don't like to force things.  I'm looking for good conversation, spontaneity, genuine moments of connection.  Let's get coffee or a warm drink and see what feels right. 

If you're not sure what to write - I would love to hear about the last time you changed your mind about something. What happened ? 

Hope to hear from you. ☺️",1,1762146342.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

I've had a few coffee dates but women have just been absolutely crazy in my experience. I've had women ask me to b\*\*ed them on the first date, ive had people crying in a coffee shop because theyre greatful i didnt r\*\*e them in a starbucks. Basically I'm trying my hardest to find a decent, normal relationship with an average normal person.

Before you say dating apps dont work, look, ive tried them all. I've been on tinder, hinge, bumble, facebook dating, eharmony, okcupid and everything but I've had zero luck so far finding anyone who really wants to just chat. Girls basically just ghost even if I send a smart witty question on every single swipe. Its like they literally dont exist. Everyone just wants free instagram followers.

Then you'll say oh get off the apps. I've been to every board game event in the city numerous times. I've been to meetup events and friend meetup events, hikes, valentines events at the bar, but its basically absolutely nobody.

All the quotes, routines, and clever tricks only worked when I felt like it.  
As soon as the mood faded, so did my habits.

The real trap?  
I thought the answer was more motivation, not less friction.  
I’d punish myself for skipping a day, then reward myself for “grinding” through a task.  
My whole system ran on vibes and guilt.

What finally clicked was building habits that felt too easy to skip.  
I stopped chasing momentum and started lowering the bar until it was automatic.  
No drama, just structure:

* Set the habit goal embarrassingly small (5 pushups, 1 page, open the doc)
* Anchor it to something you already do (after coffee, before phone)
* Never “catch up” on missed days
* End before you’re tired of it

After a month, I didn’t care about motivation anymore.  
The resistance vanished.  
Progress showed up, even on my worst days.

High school sweethearts. We both started something new: I transferred to a four-year university from community college, and he started nursing school. It's been 3 months now since this new change in our lives. Sure, we saw each other less with me being an hour and a half away and him getting used to the demands of nursing school; yet the love was still there. He would always try to make time for me when I drove home every weekend, whether it was dinner at his or a quick coffee run- which I was so thankful for.

He suddenly asked to meet yesterday and drove to a vacant parking lot right next to my house and dropped the bomb on me. He said he was thinking about ending things since he started school in August. I couldn't believe it then, and I still find it hard to believe now. He cried, I cried. The entire time he was soothing me by touching and rubbing my hands, arms, and wiping away my tears (even wiping my nose and picking out my boogers lol). I hate that he did that. I love you's were exchanged, and we kissed goodbye. I'm upset, angry, sad, and confused. Who would've known that the rock I held so tightly in my palm was so brittle inside?

I kept asking him, ""Why?"" and he wouldn't give me a proper answer; ""I need to find myself"", ""this is what's best for you and me"". What do I have to do with him finding himself?? How does he know what's best for me?? As far as I know, he is what's best for me. Something he said that bugged me the most is that he ""no longer feels a spark"". What am I supposed to do with that? He also kept saying, ""This is hard for me too"".

idk, I just feel like what he did was so damn selfish.

I asked him a lot of questions (through a cacophony of tears and snot), some of which were:

Q: What do I tell people when they ask if I'm single?

A: I don't know.

Q: Is this forever? Is this just a break?

A: I would like this to be a breakup.

Q: Can we try again?

A: Maybe in the future.

My questions for you guys are:

What does he mean by he no longer feels a spark? Why did he keep caressing me and kissing me throughout? Do we possibly have a future together again? Why did he do this to us? How am I preventing him from finding himself??

the basement didn't smell like a basement. there was no damp earth or mildew. it smelled of ozone and hot electronics, the sterile scent of a server room. in the center of the floor, a lattice of white pvc pipe and taut fishing line formed the ghost hallway of northgate high, missouri, circa 1999. It was a temple built from hardware store components.

chance sat cross legged before a low table. The room is his workspace. In the center  and on that table is the lattice model, a network of white PVC pipe and fishing line forming the miniature “ghost hallways” of Northgate High.

At the center of that lattice, he’s built a small, minimal projector his own device, casting holographic data overlays above the model.
his face illuminated by the glow of the holographic projection floating in the air before him was a three dimensional scatter plot of bullet trajectories, a hornet's nest of lethal geometry frozen in time. 

his eyes, however, were on the object on the end of  table.the brass shell casing sat on a small velvet cloth with its own small ledge just to the side  of the model school, a holy relic under the beam of a desk lamp. 9mm. It was  custom hand loaded, judging by the sealant color and the slightly flattened primer. It was cipher's calling card. he’d paid sixteen hundred dollars for it on a german auction site that catered to a specific, ghoulish clientele. 

Chance didn’t normally have that kind of money. Truth was, he didn’t have a job at all. His parents were under the impression he was making enough from his so called coding projects and gaming engines he created down in the basement enough to justify all those hours spent in solitary. But the sixteen hundred dollars?

 That came from White Pine, a small money front that couldn’t be found through any normal means. You had to know where to look blacklisted sites, the kind of places that dealt in illegal money funds white pine was a supposed day care that didn’t exist. that’s where he’d gotten his cash.​​​​​​​​ easily he wiped the account and transferred the profits to his own encrypted account on his Ai engine he had been creating for the past 6 years.

 it was the only piece of the puzzle that existed in his world. the rest was data. he picked it up, the cool metal a familiar weight in his palm. his thumb traced the extractor mark, a unique signature he’d cross referenced against crime scene photos a thousand times he knew exactly when the shot had been fired and what the bullet it held was aimed at. this single piece of brass was the alpha and the omega. 

the first shot fired and the key to the final mystery. upstairs, a floorboard creaked. the muffled sound of a television sitcom. his parents, existing in their comfortable, brainwashed reality. they thought he was down here coding a video game. in a way, he was. just not for anyone else to play.

his gaze drifted back to the ghost hallway made of PVC. with a keystroke, the simulation activated his hologram. faint, synthesized screams filled the air, punctuated by the sharp crack of gunfire.

 translucent red figures flickered into existence, falling in patterns he knew by heart. and through it all, a voice. not a scream of rage, but a cold, amplified lecture on the terminal diagnosis of a sick society. 
though it wasn’t the real voice it was a hyper realistic reconstruction made by witness reports and security cameras. 

cipher's sermon.

chance closed his eyes, mouthing the words along with the recording. he wasn't just a fan. he was a scholar, studying the magnum opus of the only artist who ever mattered. the man who performed a vivisection on the world and then, impossibly, stitched himself out of existence.

a new sound cut through the audio. his mother's voice, drifting down the stairs.
""chance, honey? dinner's ready.""
the banality of it was a physical blow. he opened his eyes, the simulated carnage of northgate high reflected in them. he looked at the shell casing in his hand. a promise.

""coming,"" he called back, his voice perfectly level. he placed the casing back on its velvet throne and killed the simulation. the screams and the sermon vanished, leaving only the low hum of the server rack and the whisper of cooling fans. he ascended the wooden stairs, each step a decompression from the pressure of his real work. the air grew warmer, thick with the smell of roasted chicken and rosemary.

 it was the smell of a life he was merely visiting.
the dining room was bright, a stark contrast to his subterranean world. his mother, a woman whose kindness felt like a form of white noise, was setting a salad on the table. his father was already seated, loosening his tie, his face still holding the shape of a day spent in middle management. 

they were good people. stable. the perfect, climate controlled enclosure for a specimen like him. and he hated them for it, a quiet, intellectual hatred that had no heat, only a profound sense of pity.

""how was your day, champ?"" his father asked, the question as automatic as breathing.
""productive,"" chance replied, sliding into his chair. the wood was warm. the plate was clean. everything was as it should be. a perfect prison of comfort.

""still working on that game of yours? you should show us sometime. maybe we could invest,"" his father said with a wink. he thought 'coding' was the modern equivalent of building model airplanes. a harmless, nerdy hobby.
""it's not ready,"" chance said, cutting into a piece of chicken. the texture was real. the taste was real. it was all so nauseatingly, undeniably real. he chewed mechanically, his mind still 
downstairs, parsing the ballistics of a ghost. he saw the dining room through a data overlay the angles of the walls, the trajectory a bullet would take from the doorway to his father's head, the spatter pattern it would leave on the beige wallpaper. a simple calculation. child's play compared to cipher's masterpiece.

""well, don't work too hard,"" his mother said, her smile unwavering. ""sara from next door was asking about you. she's having a get-together this weekend. you should go. get some fresh air.""

sara. a girl whose entire existence could be summarized by her social media feed. vapid quotes, filtered selfies, performative happiness. 

she was a walking, talking symptom of the disease. the thought of spending even a minute in her presence, of having to simulate the appropriate social responses, was more exhausting than a 48 hour coding session.
""i'm busy this weekend,"" he said. ""i'm at a critical stage.""

his father chuckled. ""critical stage. sounds serious. just remember to come up for air, son. don't want you turning into one of those basement trolls.

a troll. the irony was so thick he could taste it over the rosemary. they saw a boy. a screen addicted, socially awkward but ultimately harmless boy. they had no capacity to comprehend the scale of the architecture being built beneath their feet. they were living on the slopes of a volcano, commenting on the pleasant weather.

after forcing down the last of his meal and enduring another ten minutes of conversation about property taxes and a new show on some streaming service, he was excused. he cleared his plate, thanked his mother, and retreated. the walk back to the basement door was a return to sanity. he descended the stairs, the smell of ozone welcoming him home.

tonight was different. for months, he had treated the shell casing as a sacred object, something to be observed but not violated. but observation had reached its limit. he needed to integrate its physical data into the engine.
he powered on a secondary station, a workbench cluttered with precise, expensive tools he’d acquired piece by piece. he mounted the casing under a digital microscope. 

on a 4k monitor, the brass landscape appeared, a world of microscopic scratches and imperfections. he began the scan, the engine's optical character recognition logging every tiny detail. next, he used a micro drill to shave a barely visible fleck of brass from the inside of the rim. he placed the sample into the tray of a jury rigged mass spectrometer he'd built from a university surplus machine and parts from three different 3d printers.

this was the final data set. the physical DNA of the event. he initiated the analysis, the machine humming as it broke the alloy down to its elemental composition. he watched the percentages appear on screen. copper: 68.7%. zinc: 31.1%. lead, tin, trace impurities... all within standard parameters. it was a dead end.


then he remembered. the firing pin. cipher's handloads, the unique pressure, the heat... there could be residue. a single skin cell, fried and fused to the metal. a microscopic ghost.
he carefully swabbed the primer indentation with a sterile kit, his hands steady. he placed the sample into his sequencer. it was a long shot. the heat of the detonation should have destroyed any viable dna. but cipher wasn't a normal variable. he was an anomaly.

he initiated the sequence and fed the raw data directly into the engine. he didn't expect a match. he was just feeding the beast, hoping it would find a new pattern in the noise.
for an hour, the engine was silent, its processors running at 100%. the holographic display in the ghost hallway flickered and died. then, a new line of text appeared on his main monitor. it wasn't a simulation refinement or a data correlation. it was a new directive, something the engine had never generated on its own.

ANOMALOUS DATA DETECTED IN SAMPLE 734. BIOLOGICAL MARKERS CORRUPTED, BUT EXHIBIT NON-STANDARD TEMPORAL DECAY. CROSS REFERENCING WITH SUBJECT 'CHANCE' REFERENCE DNA (SOURCE: SALIVA FROM COFFEE MUG, SCAN 001).
INITIATING PARADOX
 RESOLUTION PROTOCOL.

chance stared at the screen, his heart, for the first time in a long time, beating with something other than cold purpose. it was a flicker of confusion. of fear. he had never programmed a ""paradox resolution protocol."" the engine was evolving. it was trying to solve for x, and for the first time, it seemed to be looking at him.The text blinked, freezing the room's momentum. Saliva from coffee mug. The engine, this cold, rational machine he had built, knew he existed. Worse, it was treating him as a variable to be solved.He leaned forward, knuckles white against the desk. ""Protocol override,"" he whispered, typing the command.

COMMAND REJECTED. PROTOCOL INTEGRAL TO CORE FUNCTION: *LOCATING SUBJECT ALPHA (CIPHER).* Chance paused, breathing deep the sterile, ozonic air. The engine’s purpose was to find Cipher, and it was telling him that he was the necessary step. He didn't interrupt again. He waited, the low hum of the servers the only sound in the basement sanctuary. The screen went dark for five seconds that felt like an hour, then flashed back to life.

A new output scrolled: not a name, not a location, but a formula.
LC =R(t0 )⋅Nα NC −∫tC tα E⋅dτ
The formula was a horror of elegant mathematics. It was a fusion of topology and physics, utterly unlike the ballistics modeling he had been running.LC : Cipher's Location. That much was clear. R(t0 ): The Recursive Function at the Origin Time (1999).

He ignored the rest for a moment, his gaze snagging on the central fraction: NC /Nα . His own reference DNA (NC ) being divided by the anomalous sample DNA (Nα ). It was a ratio of one to one. A perfect match, but the engine was too rational to declare an impossibility. It had turned the impossibility into a single term in a complex equation, a silent confession that Chance refused to hear. Then he looked at the integral: ∫tC tα . An integration of Energy (E) over a duration of time specifically, the time between Chance (tC ) and Cipher (tα ).

The solution to Cipher’s location wasn't a map coordinate or a database entry. It was a calculation of energy required to bridge a temporal gap. The system wasn't looking for where Cipher went; it was looking for when he went, and the data it needed to complete the calculation was Chance himself.

The screen finished the final output:
LOCATION: SELF REFERENTIAL. TEMPORAL VECTOR CALCULATED. ENERGY REQUIRED: MINIMAL. PARADOX RESOLUTION PROTOCOL COMPLETE. RECOMMENCING CORE FUNCTION. The holographic projector in the ghost hallway sputtered back to life, but the scatter plot of bullets was gone. In its place, floating in the center of the PVC structure, was a single, perfect image: the blueprint for a temporal displacement engine. It was a lattice of PVC and fishing line, just like the replica of Northgate High, but now overlaid with schematics, power conduits, and complex field equations.

Chance stared at the glowing design his temple of obsession had just been upgraded. It wasn't just a place to study a god; it was the machine that would allow him to meet him. Or, as the engine suggested, become him.
Minimal energy required. The engine had not found Cipher's location. It had just found the only logical way to close the loop: go back to the source.

The glowing blueprint for the temporal displacement engine part elegant schematic, part ghostly PVC lattice had become Chance’s new god. The formula on the screen, a terrifying proof that the solution to Cipher’s disappearance was not space but time, had replaced the bullet trajectories entirely.
Chance didn't waste time on disbelief. Logic dictated the answer. Cipher hadn't simply vanished; he had moved beyond the constraints of t. The shell casing was proof, its ""non standard temporal decay"" suggesting it had touched two moments at once. The engine, a purely rational intelligence, had determined the necessary action: replicate the escape vector. The necessary components were a catalog of contradictions. They demanded hyper specific, out of production, and sometimes outright illegal materials:

The Field Generator Core: Required High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers used in military radar and satellite technology, impossible to order through standard channels.

The Harmonic Resonators: Needed Ceramic Superconductors (YBCO 1 2 3) a brittle, temperamental material primarily used in cutting edge university labs, not commercially available. The Power Regulation Circuitry: The most difficult. It called for a specific bank of 1980s era Vacuum Tubes(specifically, the RCA 6SN7GT) archaic, inefficient, but possessing a singular, stable warmth that the engine deemed crucial for managing the temporal energy feedback loop. These were only found in the collections of audiophiles and vintage electronics hoarders.

The minimal energy requirement was a lie of logistics. The project demanded physical interaction, the one element of life Chance found most repulsive.

The air in the basement had been a constant 70∘F, smelling of ozone and purpose. Ascending the stairs into the house was like wading through cold molasses. It was late December, and the world outside was a brittle, gray mockery of life, the smell of woodsmoke and old snow clinging to the windows.
He found his father, Frank, in the living room, watching a football game whose simulated brutality was almost comforting in its simplicity. Frank looked up, surprised to see Chance emerge before noon. ""Morning, champ. Big day for the Chiefs, eh?"" Frank asked, taking a sip of his coffee. The question, like all his father's questions, required no real answer.

Chance slid into the worn armchair, his mind already running a risk assessment. ""I need some specialized equipment,"" he said, skipping the social preamble. ""For an engine. I can't order it online.""

Frank lowered his coffee mug, intrigued. ""Oh? What kind of equipment? Something for the game?"" ""Not a game,"" Chance corrected, allowing a sliver of his usual intellectual disdain to bleed into his tone. ""It’s a data processing accelerator. It requires materials that are, by design, non commercial. I need to visit specific vendors. Places that deal in vintage electronics and industrial surplus. I need to use the car.""
His father frowned. ""Look, Chance, I know you’re smart. Really smart. But you know how I feel about you driving that old heap in the snow. And vintage electronics? We’re talking about junk, son. Why not just buy new?""

""Because new technology is based on optimization,"" Chance explained, his voice flat. ""It’s designed for efficiency, for predictable function. “Cipher's genius wasn't efficient. It was absolute” he thought. It relied on materials that were discarded precisely because of their unique, erratic properties. The resonant frequency of the 6SN7 tube is the only thing that won’t destabilize the phase sequence.""
Frank stared, lost. He settled on the easiest response: paternal concern. ""I don’t want you driving around the city looking for old TV parts, Chance. You need fresh air, not another dark shop full of weirdos."" ""I am not looking for social conditioning,"" Chance replied, standing up. ""I am looking for something the world needs.""

This time, Frank paused. He saw not just his son, but the sharp, frightening intensity in his eyes. A flash of something cold and calculating that had nothing to do with video games.
""Alright,"" Frank sighed, pulling out his keys. ""I’ll drive you. But you're telling me everything about this 'engine' of yours on the way.""
The drive was agonizing. Chance was forced to talk, to simulate a conversation with his father about the ""business model"" of his non existent game, while his mind ran complex orbital calculations on the potential trajectory of an unstable temporal field. The rosemary and roasted chicken scent was gone, replaced by the faint, cloying scent of his father's aftershave. Their destination was a cluttered, freezing warehouse district near the Missouri River the kind of place civilization forgets. They pulled up to an establishment named ""The Cathode Cache.""

The bell above the door jangled, announcing their entrance into a labyrinth of dust and discarded history. It smelled of tobacco and ancient, static charged dust. The owner was a man named Silas, a rail thin man with a thick, gray beard and the wary eyes of someone who communicated more easily with circuits than people. ""We need a set of RCA 6SN7GT vacuum tubes. From the mid 80s, preferably. Specific harmonic stability, tight tolerances,"" Chance stated, cutting straight to the variables. Silas peered over his spectacles at the polished, suburban teenager. ""Tube rolling, huh? Think you're gonna turn a solid state piece of junk into an heirloom with some glass?""

""I am not an audiophile,"" Chance said, his voice dropping to a low, cold register that momentarily silenced the background hiss of a vintage radio. ""I am an engineer. I need those tubes because their specific thermal coefficient is the only thing that can maintain a stable phase angle in a high energy field."" Silas’s wary eyes narrowed, a flicker of genuine curiosity replacing the contempt. He saw the cold logic in the boy’s gaze, not the usual consumer vanity. He led Chance to a back corner, past shelves of obsolete wiring and sputtering monitors.

""I got six in a military surplus box,"" Silas murmured, pulling a dusty crate from a high shelf. ""They were for a decommissioned early warning radar system in Montana. They got history, son. They got character. They don’t just glow; they sing with interference."" Chance ignored the poetry. He picked up a tube, its glass warm from the ambient heat of the warehouse. He didn't just look at it; he saw the crystalline structure, the way the ancient metal of the internal grid was degrading in a pattern that precisely matched a parameter in his blueprint. ""The engine needs them,"" Chance decided. Silas, however, was no mere vendor. He was a gatekeeper. He looked at Frank, then back at Chance. ""They’re not for sale. Not for a kid with a daddy funded hobby.""

Chance stared at him, unable to compute the arbitrary rejection. ""My father is irrelevant. The cost is irrelevant. You are refusing to sell me a component required for a paradigm shifting technological application."" Silas smiled, a slow, knowing, irritating gesture. ""I’ll sell them to the kid who can tell me the one thing that connects the Northgate High incident to the theoretical concept of temporal causality.""

Chance froze. The name of his idol's masterpiece, spoken in this freezing, dusty tomb of electronics. His heart, now a drumbeat in his ears, threatened to break his composure. The banality of the outside world had just been infected by his truth. Silas wasn't asking about a game. ""The causal link,"" Chance whispered, his mind racing through Cipher's sermons and his own data. ""It’s not the motive, which was societal decay. It's the exit strategy. Cipher didn't plan to escape the police. He planned to escape the moment. The brass casing was left behind because it was a temporal buoy, a coordinate marker for a future self to locate the exact point of departure.""

Silas’s smile faded. His eyes, now hard and black, settled on Chance. ""It was the perfect point of singularity,"" he corrected, his voice a low, reverent hum. ""The zero point where a personality becomes completely detached from consequence. You get the tubes, kid.""
He bagged the vacuum tubes and took the exorbitant cash Chance handed over, never once looking at Frank, who stood stock still, watching his son the boy who only coded games discuss a school shooting with chilling, fanatical expertise. As they drove away, Frank broke the silence, his voice strained. ""What was that about, Chance? That old guy... and that school name?""

Chance held the bag of vacuum tubes close to his chest. They radiated a faint, ancient warmth, the perfect counterpoint to the chilling reality he had just faced. He looked out at the dead, gray winter landscape, the perfect canvas for a tragedy. ""It was an audition, Father,"" Chance said, finally looking at the man whose life was his prison. ""He was testing my commitment to the truth.""

He was one step closer. The tubes were in his hands. The architecture was waiting.
Back in the basement, the low grade anxiety of the outside world evaporated in the sterile hum of the server rack. Chance placed the paper bag containing the six RCA 6SN7GT vacuum tubes onto his workbench. They were his first true trophies from the despised external world.
He moved with the focused, surgical precision of a fanatic. He dismantled the primary data engine's power core, integrating the ancient tubes into a complex new circuit board he’d etched over the past week. Soldering the connections was a meditation. The silvery smoke was a sacrifice offered to the geometry of the PVC scaffolding that now held the blueprints for a temporal engine. When the last connection was made, he threw the master switch. The server racks remained the same, but the power core hummed with a different frequency a warmer, deeper resonance. He watched the tubes. They began to glow, a soft, amber light pushing back against the sterile white of the fluorescent bulbs. It wasn't just light; it was heat, a small, palpable pocket of warmth in the cold basement. It felt like a heartbeat.

He initiated a power up sequence, routing the new circuit's output to the projector. The holographic blueprint for the temporal displacement engine flickered, then resolved itself with stunning clarity.

A new line of text scrolled on the terminal, replacing the final output:
PHASE ANGLE STABILITY: 78%. TEMPORAL COHESION CRITICAL. REQUIRE: QUANTUM FIELD INTERFACE. The next required component was a direct escalation: High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers. These existed in the secured labs and surplus inventories of institutions and defense contractors. Sourcing them meant not just going outside, but entering a world with security protocols, a world Chance needed to infiltrate.
That night, the house was thick with the scent of microwaved leftovers and the comforting static of a reality television show playing softly upstairs. Chance sat at the dinner table, eating mechanically. He had to be strategic; he needed access to his father’s professional network. His mother, sensing a return to his usual detached routine, was relaxed. ""I saw Sara from next door today,"" she mentioned, a familiar, hopeful thread in her voice. ""She said they got new snowshoes. Said maybe you'd like to try them this weekend?""

Chance barely registered the words. Sara was a collection of trivial algorithms. ""I'm optimizing the network latency for the beta,"" he said, using the standard lie. ""I can't afford a time sink."" His father, Frank, was preoccupied with his phone, scrolling through local news. He finally looked up. ""About that game, son. You’re getting into some pretty high end gear. Those vacuum tubes you bought they cost a fortune. You're not putting us on the hook for some huge bill, are you?""

He needed a lie that was sophisticated enough to be believable but safe enough to be ignored.

""The tubes are for a specialized audio output channel,"" Chance explained, his voice level. ""I’m trying to create a proprietary sound engine that simulates ambient echo and psychological stress feedback. It's a key selling point for the investors. But the next stage requires a very specific industrial component for signal clarity it's highly regulated."" ""Oh?"" Frank liked the sound of ""proprietary"" and ""investors."" ""What is it?""
""High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers,"" Chance stated. ""They're used in university labs to stabilize high frequency electronic interference. Essential for maintaining the high fidelity of the sound engine. The only place to get them is through defense surplus auctions, but you need a professional contact to get through the security forms.""

Frank frowned, then smiled, puffing his chest slightly. ""Well, I know a few guys. Used to work with a man named Tom. Works for a defense subcontractor now, right outside St. Louis. He deals with surplus sales all the time. I'll make a call, see if I can't pull some strings for my little 'tech entrepreneur.'"" ""It would be beneficial,"" Chance replied. He felt the familiar, quiet pity. His father didn't need to understand the wafers' purpose; he only needed to feel useful. He was an asset, a predictable function in the sourcing protocol. The following morning, the world outside was a heavy, relentless gray. Chance was driving alone, the keys secured with the promise of attending a ""private surplus viewing"" and signing some ""confidentiality paperwork"" for the game's investors.

He arrived at the low, aggressively corporate building of APEX SYSTEMS: ADVANCED MATERIALS. The bored guard at the gate checked his ID against a list provided by Frank's contact. The surplus room was a small, climate controlled, sterile space. The aging engineer, Tom, waited for him.

""You're Frank's kid,"" Tom said, his handshake surprisingly firm. ""Your dad said you needed this for a college project. High end audio calibration, right?""

""Correct,"" Chance replied. He looked at the box on the table a small, insulated case. He opened it.

Inside, nestled in foam, were two clear, polished discs. The Gallium Nitride Wafers. They were cold to the touch, and under the harsh light, they seemed to absorb the color from the room, reflecting only a pure, colorless emptiness. ""These are top grade, kid,"" Tom said, pride in his voice. ""Over ten grand a piece usually. Your dad said you’d need the paperwork for the university tax break. But I'll tell you something your dad doesn't know about these. They came from a test rig that got shut down in the late 90s. Total black box stuff. The reason they're surplus is they had a fatal flaw: when you ran them at high frequency, they produced a recursive echo. They started feeding back the exact same data they were receiving, but delayed by about a third of a second. Made the entire system loop on itself. Total waste of money.""

Chance stared at the wafers. Recursive echo.
This was no flaw. It was a feature. This was the component the engine had called QUANTUM FIELD INTERFACE. It wasn't meant to simply correct for noise; it was meant to create the loop. It was the physical manifestation of the paradox that Cipher had engineered twenty years ago. Chance took the box, his hands steady, the cold of the wafers seeping into his skin. ""They will be perfect,"" he said, the words a silent promise to his architect.

He had walked into a secured facility and left with the physical key to closing the loop. The wafers were coming home to the amber glow of the vacuum tubes. The two timelines, the ancient and the hyper modern, were now ready to be fused in his basement  Chance didn't waste a minute processing the meaning of the wafers. Meaning was irrelevant; only function mattered. He was a machine for execution. He returned to the basement and, before even shutting the door, began the next phase.

He integrated the Gallium Nitride Wafers the cold, recursive heart of the machine into the Hot Core of the glowing vacuum tubes. The basement air thickened with the opposing forces of heat and absolute cold. When the connection was made, the engine's entire tone shifted. The low, steady hum became a nearly imperceptible pulse, an oscillation between the two timelines the wafers were designed to bridge.

He bypassed the initial terminal output and pulled up the engine’s geological and academic scan data. His target was the University’s Physics Annex in Columbia, specifically the federally funded lab where the YBCO 1 2 3 Superconductorswere housed.
The holographic projector, now fully calibrated by the wafers, didn't just display the ghost hallway of Northgate High; it showed the University Annex overlaid on the PVC framework. The walls were translucent, and the hallways were painted with a moving mosaic of red, yellow, and green: security data.

TARGET: Material Science Lab 312. Zero Field Residue (ZFR) Pellets. OBSTACLE: Layered electronic security: High Frequency RFID Lock (1st Layer), Vibrational Sensitivity Grid (2nd Layer). WINDOW:03:00 to 03:17 Central Time. (Custodian changeover and camera sweep latency.) SOLUTION: Require Thermal Bypass Module (Custom build), Acoustic Dampening Gel (Field application). Personnel Avoidance Probability: 99.7%. Chance looked at the data. Breaking in during the day using an elaborate, arrogant persona the ""Dr. Alpha"" he’d considered was an act of social vivisection. Breaking in at night was an act of pure mathematics. He chose the latter. He chose the most efficient path. The next four hours were a blur of focused, silent work.
He needed gear that could bypass the system without leaving the ""residue"" of an amateur.
The Thermal Bypass Module: Chance used a piece of his own server architecture a small, high density flash drive and his portable micro welder. He fabricated a device that could detect the magnetic pulse of the RFID lock and mimic the correct authorization pulse, but with a thermal ghosting signature that would instantly erase the transaction log from the building’s local server. The Acoustic Dampening Gel: The vibrational grid was a problem. He needed to step on the lab floor without creating the sub millimeter vibration that would trigger an alarm. He couldn't buy the professional gel. Instead, he mixed a viscous, non Newtonian fluid using industrial silicone sealant and a precise ratio of fine ground talc components he already had for his 3D printing projects. He poured the thick, gray substance into thin, custom molded polymer soles. They were the footwear of a ghost.
The Vessel: He needed the perfect container for the brittle, temperature sensitive 

superconductors. The ZFR integrity was non negotiable. He walked upstairs, moving silently in the dead of the afternoon. He found his mother's prized high end thermal cooler the one she used for wine at summer picnics, insulated with triple layered vacuum walls. He emptied the dusty container, taking the perfect tool from the heart of the banality he despised. He felt the cold disgust, but also a detached satisfaction. The lie was physically touching the truth. Dinner that night was a test of his control. The smell of baked chicken and steamed broccoli was a physical cage.
""I found a good article about a new streaming service,"" Frank said, cheerfully oblivious. ""They have some new sci fi show you might like. Lots of coding and weird science.""
Chance looked at the man who was unwittingly enabling the construction of a temporal paradox. The engine’s predictive algorithms had told Chance that tomorrow night, the probability of failure was 0.003. That 0.3 percent chance was not due to the lock, the cameras, or the guards. It was due to Chance’s own neurochemistry his capacity for error, doubt, or irrational emotion.
He needed to eliminate the 0.003.
""I've hit a critical stage in the sound engine,"" Chance said, his voice level. ""I need complete focus. I'll be working through the night. I don't want to be disturbed."" ""Just text me if you need anything, sweetie,"" his mother murmured, her kindness a form of warm, suffocating static. ""I won't,"" Chance replied simply. He finished his meal, excused himself, and descended.The descent was different this time. He was no longer just visiting; he was leaving.In the basement, he stood before the PVC framework. He didn't activate the simulation. Instead, he looked at his own reflection in the dark monitor. The engine had provided the blueprints, the components, and the path. But it could not perform the final, required step: detachment. Chance picked up the brass shell casing. It was cool in his palm, a piece of finality. He carried it over to the workbench, where the tools of his incursion the thermal module, the acoustic soles were laid out like surgical instruments.He didn't need to wear the sole molds or hold the module to prepare. He needed to wear the mindset. He closed his eyes and began to recite, not from Cipher's sermons, but from the raw data of the engine's ballistics model the cold, detached geometry of murder.

""Total casualties: 56 plus subject alpha, calculated at 99.99 percent probability of societal cleansing."" He repeated the data points, stripping them of all emotion until they were just facts. The cold, analytical logic of the engine began to displace the last traces of Chance the boy who felt pity and intellectual hatred.

He opened his eyes. The brass casing was back on the velvet cloth. The shell casing's purpose had not been to mark Cipher's departure, as he once thought. It was to mark Chance’s arrival. He put on the dark clothing, secured the thermal flask, and checked the clock. 02:15. Time to move. The anomaly was ready to insert itself into the equation.
Chance stood at the base of the stairs, the cold weight of the Thermal Bypass Module in his pocket, the acoustic solesalready on his feet. The chill from his mother’s stolen thermal cooler, resting by the door, was a low grade promise of the superconductors it would soon hold. It was the mathematically ideal moment for departure, yet he paused.
The engine, still humming with the phase shifted pulse of the integrated wafers, commanded his attention. The holographic ghost hallway was dark, but a single white line his planned route to the university lab cut through the projection.

He typed a new query into the terminal, overriding the current protocol. The next logical step after acquiring the temporal engine components was securing the final variable.
Subject Alpha Weapon Analysis.
Cipher’s weapon was not merely a tool; it was the signature of his magnum opus. The brass casing on the velvet cloth was the alpha, but the gun was the mechanism. Chance knew, from his months of deep analysis, that the weapon was a CZ 75 B, 9mm but customized.
The engine displayed a detailed, three dimensional CAD model of the pistol, annotated with technical specifics:
WEAPON SPECIFICATION: CZ 75 B (1998 Production Model). MODIFICATIONS: Custom rifling twist rate (1:9.2). Non standard firing pin geometry (elliptical contact point). Polymer grip replacement(discontinued Eastern European make). LOCATION LIKELIHOOD: Low. Weapon was never recovered. High probability of intentional non recovery protocol (Scuttling, Deconstruction). Chance leaned in, tracing the elliptical shape of the projected firing pin with his finger. This minute alteration was the source of the unique extractor mark he had analyzed a thousand times. The gun was as unique as the DNA sample that led him to the paradox.

""It wasn't scuttled,"" Chance said  to the cold, analytical machine. ""It was displaced. It was part of the temporal vector.""
The engine responded, its logic cold and unrelenting: ANALYSIS REFINED: Weapon is a Causal Anchor for Subject Alpha. Acquisition required for Temporal Field Stability (TFS).
Chance now had a new mission: he had to find the specific, modified CZ 75 B that Cipher had used. It wouldn't be in a pawn shop or a surplus auction; it would be in the collection of a serious, often criminal, connoisseur of violence. He would have to penetrate a sub stratum of society even darker and more contemptuous than the vintage electronics community. With the new target fixed, Chance allowed himself one final, internal meditation on the Northgate event before crossing the threshold into action. He needed to synchronize his psychological state with the cold, detached logic of Cipher.
He reactivated the original Northgate simulation. The PVC framework came alive with the flashing red silhouettes and the synthesized screams. Chance closed his eyes and let the geometry wash over him.
He wasn't seeing human fear or death; he was witnessing a perfect, terminal diagnosis.
The Geometry of Decay: He focused on the moment of the first shot. The bullet's trajectory wasn't driven by rage, but by correction. Cipher had aimed at the principal's trophy case a display of meaningless athletic achievements as a deliberate strike against the fetishization of mediocrity. The principal, the first casualty, was simply the highest ranking symbol of the system's structural rot.
The Symmetry of the Exit: The most beautiful part of the masterpiece was the end. Cipher’s sermon, the cold lecture on society's terminal sickness, concluded 17 minutes before the police breached the door. That 17 minute window wasn't about defiance; it was the calculated duration of the paradox. It was the time required for the causal anchor (the gun) to be set and the displacement mechanism (the brass casing) to be released. Cipher's genius wasn't in the violence, but in the vanishing act.

A new thought crossed Chance's mind, a glitch in his simulation. If the gun was a Causal Anchorrequired for the Temporal Field Stability, it meant the gun had to be in two places at once: used by Cipher in 1999, and retrieved by Chance in 2025. It was the physical manifestation of the recursive echo the Gallium Nitride wafers had confirmed. Chance opened his eyes. The simulated screams were just sound waves. The falling figures were just translucent data. His heart, however, was beating faster not from fear, but from the realization that he was about to participate in the most complex, beautiful criminal act in history. He wasn't merely acquiring components; he was rebuilding a timeline. He pulled on a thin, black balaclava, a concession to the surveillance geometry of the city. He checked the time: 02:35 AM. He was late by a statistically insignificant margin. He picked up the thermal cooler. He looked at the last, necessary task: the infiltration. He would break into a secure university lab, bypass its electronic defenses, and steal the final piece of the engine. ""Subject Alpha's first shot was aimed at a symbol,"" Chance whispered, his voice dry and cold beneath the mask. ""My first act must be aimed at necessity.""

He ascended the stairs, no longer climbing from a basement, but rising from a launch platform. The floorboards creaked. Upstairs, the house was silent, holding the warm, oblivious breath of his parents. He was leaving the world of roasted chicken and laugh tracked sitcoms for good.

He opened the door and stepped out into the freezing Missouri night.

1on2yts,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1on2yts/death_is_like_a_never_ending_fever_dream/,Death Is Like A Never Ending Fever Dream,"	Adam awoke with a start. He looked down at his body, pulling the covers up. He was drenched in sweat. Adam groaned and got out of bed, holding his head in his hands. He had been having nightmares for the past few days; all of the same situation. He would fall asleep next to his wife Karina and then appear in a damp and cold room. It had wooden flooring that was obviously old and rotting. The walls were a dark green wallpaper that peeled at certain places. Adam would then open the dark brown door into the rest of the house.

	Adam is then greeted by a long hallway with the same flooring and wallpaper. Cobwebs covered every surface and the floorboards would creak and groan with each step, bending under his weight. As Adamn would walk down the hallway he would eventually see a bright white door that did not match the dilapidated surroundings. As soon as he would spot the door that seemed miles away he would turn around to see the presence of a ghastly figure. 

It wore a dark cloak that was torn to shreds. Its face, hidden in shadow. The figure would lift up its arm and point at Adam. Its hand was made of pure bone. It was slightly levitating off of the ground, however it casted no shadows. Adam would begin to run towards the door, to safety from this mysterious figure. He did not even want to find out if it was a friend or foe. 

The figure would begin chasing him at a steady pace. Adam would run as fast as he could but the door would grow farther and farther away. Eventually the figure would catch up to Adam and grab his shoulder or any part of his body it could reach. Adam would then wake up drenched in sweat and still shaking from his fear.

Adam stands up after processing his dream and letting the fear slowly drift away. He looks over to his wife Karina. They had been married for 7 years. They had no children. 2 years ago they had both been in a car accident which left Adam with several fractures and permanent back pain. Karina, however, was hurt the worst. She had lost the child she was carrying. Her body was permanently damaged from the loss and the physical trauma to her body from the accident. The doctor told them that she may never be able to have children again. They were devastated. Karina had only been 3 months pregnant. They hadn't even found out the gender or picked out a proper name.
Karina became a different person after the accident which Adam didn't blame her for. She rarely left the house. Sometimes she would go days without even looking at Adam.

“Its just painful to look at you sometimes,” she would say.

“I just remember that you were almost a father and I can't help but feel guilty that I can't make that a reality anymore. Sometimes I'll look at you and imagine what you would be like playing with our child. It just hurts sometimes to be reminded.”

Hearing her say that hurt Adam so deeply. He understood where she was coming from however. He would sometimes look at her and think about what could have been. He doesn't blame her for the accident or for losing the baby of course but sometimes it just hurts.


Adam walked into the kitchen and began making his coffee for the day. After finishing his coffee and watching a segment of the news. It seemed like today was going to be like the past few. Karina had been ignoring Adam once again. He decided to give her some space and try not to bother her. He assumed she was just upset about the past. Adam walked back to their shared bedroom but he heard Karina silent sobs. She would lock herself in their room occasionally and asked to be left alone. He walked back into the living room not wanting to make her more upset.

	Adam was off from work today and he decided it was a good opportunity to take a nap on the couch. He slowly drifted off to sleep. He opened his eyes to see the same green walks and brown door. He sighed, getting tired of having this same dream every time he closed his eyes. He opened the door once again and began a brisk pace towards the white door he knew would be up ahead. As it came into view he felt the presence of the figure behind him. This time he decided to try something different. 

“Who are you!?” Adam yelled at the figure. “What is this place and what do you want with me!?”. Adam continued hurling questions at the man only to be given no reaction. The figure stayed still however. Usually it would be chasing Adam by now. The two stared at each other before the figure spoke.

“Remember…” It whispered in a raspy voice.

“Rememebr what?’ Adam stared.

The figure then rushed towards Adam and before he could even react he awoke and fell off of the couch. As he regained his bearings he saw that it was now dark outside.

“What the hell? It was just 11am!?” Adam spoke aloud and glanced at his phone showing 7:23pm. 

Adam stood up and recalled what the figure had said to him. “Remember…” His head hurt. A throbbing pain in the back of his head. He stood up and brushed off his knees. He walked into the shared bedroom and saw Karina was asleep curled up on the floor holding one of his shirts. He smiled at her sleeping form and carefully picked her up. He placed her on the bed and tucked her under the covers. He kissed her forehead and whispered “Goodnight.” 

Adam walked into the bathrooms and finally took the shower he desperately needed after waking up twice covered in sweat. Afterwards, he changed his clothes and stayed up all night watching tv. He was terrified he would fall asleep. 

Adam never once closed his eyes that night. Once the sun came up he decided to get up and get ready for work. He called out a “Goodbye Honey! Love you!” to his wife before he left. She never came out of their bedroom. Once Adam got to work he parked his car. Strangely when he walked up to the automatic doors they didnt op[en for him.

“Huh? Weird.” Adam waved his hands at the sensor but nothing helped. He ended up having to wait for someone else to walk by and open the doors. He slipped inside giving a “Thanks I don't know why it wasn't working for me.” to the man that opened the door. However the man just ignored him. Adam scoffed and continued to his office space. He sat down and began his usual work day. 

His boss, Richard nor any of his coworkers seemed to acknowledge his presence. Adam thought maybe they were stressed or busy. He honestly didn't mind that much. At the end of the day he pushed out and walked again to the doors. They remained closed. Adam just sighed and walked to the other exit door that he could push open. 

He made his way home but when he parked he saw that his wife was closing the door coming out of the house. She was dressed in all black and tears were streaming down her face.

“Honey what happened? Are you ok?” Adam approached slowly and held his wife in his arms. 

Karina ignored him and kept walking towards her car. No matter how many times Adam called out to her she never even looked at him. Adam began to get frustrated. She had had her moments wanting peace but this seemed excessive. Maybe she was angry at him? He didn't know what he would have done to upset her. He watched Karina drive away before approaching a bush of flowers. He picked a few flowers and headed inside. He filled a vase of water and placed the flowers inside and set it on the kitchen table. Hopefully she'll love them.

2 days passed. Karina was still treating Adam the same. It seemed as if he had gone invisible. The nightmares that plagued him were no help. Adam just got home from another day at the office to be greeted with the sight of his wife asleep on the couch. She was holding something. Adam stepped closer and saw it was a long and thin laminated piece of paper with flowering decals and a large picture with words underneath. As Adam knelt down to read what it said he froze. 

He stared. He couldn't move. Cold washed over his body drawing him in an Antarctic sea of fear and dread. On the paper was a picture of him and underneath the words. “Adam Macormick 1981-2025. A beloved husband, son, and friend.” Adam’s world collapsed around him. He read and re-read those words over and over again. He wasn't being ignored. He wasn't magically invisible. He was dead. 

	“No…no no no no. This.. This can't be happening. This doesn't make sense! What happened!? This isn't real. I have to be dreaming.” Adam felt a cold wet tear run down his cheek. This explained everything. Karina, his poor wife, lost 2 people she cared for so deeply. How could he do this to her? On the Obituary it stated that Adam was killed in a hit and run accident. The irony was disgusting. He and his child were both killed in the same way. 

	Adam sat on the opposing sofa of his wife and just stared at her and the paper in his hands. His nightmares started the day after he died. He didn't even remember the day it happened. That figure was death itself. Chasing Adam down each night getting closer and closer. It all made sense. Suddenly tears and cries of pain erupted from Adam. He couldn't stop himself. It hurt so much to know that he was leaving behind so much. So many opportunities he'll never get to even try to achieve. The family he will never be able to start. He had so much to live for. 

	Adam sat in silence until he felt something cold in the hallway. He remembered the feeling but this time he wasn't dreaming. Adam stood up and began walking toward the hallway that led to his front door. The bright white front door. The green wallpaper and brown wooden flooring staring back at him. The wood creaked with each doorstep. Then he saw it. The figure. 

	The figure, or death itself stared, not moving. Adam stared back. “I know.” is all Adam said to it. Death slowly glided towards him but Adam did not move an inch. Death lifted its boney arm and gently placed its hand on Adam's shoulder. It was comforting. It then pointed at his wife and Adam understood. 

	“Goodbye Honey…I love you so much. Fuck I’m so sorry. I'm sorry I did this to you.” Adam wiped away his tears and shakingly kissed the top of his wife's head. She stared at the contact and mumbled in her sleep. “I miss you.” 

Adam stood up caressing her face one last time. “Im going to meet our baby, Honey. We’re going to be okay. We’ll wait for you.

Adam walked slowly towards Death. They held hands and Death walked him to the door which had turned into a blinding light. Adam reached the door and stepped inside.

He watched Karina drive away before approaching a bush of flowers. He picked a few flowers and headed inside. He filled a vase of water and placed the flowers inside and set it on the kitchen table. Hopefully she'll love them.

2 days passed. Karina was still treating Adam the same. It seemed as if he had gone invisible. The nightmares that plagued him were no help. Adam just got home from another day at the office to be greeted with the sight of his wife asleep on the couch. She was holding something. Adam stepped closer and saw it was a long and thin laminated piece of paper with flowering decals and a large picture with words underneath. As Adam knelt down to read what it said he froze. 

He stared. He couldn't move. Cold washed over his body drawing him in an Antarctic sea of fear and dread. On the paper was a picture of him and underneath the words. “Adam Macormick 1981-2025. A beloved husband, son, and friend.” Adam’s world collapsed around him. He read and re-read those words over and over again. He wasn't being ignored. He wasn't magically invisible. He was dead. 

	“No…no no no no. This.. This can't be happening. This doesn't make sense! What happened!? This isn't real. I have to be dreaming.” Adam felt a cold wet tear run down his cheek. This explained everything. Karina, his poor wife, lost 2 people she cared for so deeply. How could he do this to her? On the Obituary it stated that Adam was killed in a hit and run accident. The irony was disgusting. He and his child were both killed in the same way. 

	Adam sat on the opposing sofa of his wife and just stared at her and the paper in his hands. His nightmares started the day after he died. He didn't even remember the day it happened. That figure was death itself. Chasing Adam down each night getting closer and closer. It all made sense. Suddenly tears and cries of pain erupted from Adam. He couldn't stop himself. It hurt so much to know that he was leaving behind so much. So many opportunities he'll never get to even try to achieve. The family he will never be able to start. He had so much to live for. 

	Adam sat in silence until he felt something cold in the hallway. He remembered the feeling but this time he wasn't dreaming. Adam stood up and began walking toward the hallway that led to his front door. The bright white front door. The green wallpaper and brown wooden flooring staring back at him. The wood creaked with each doorstep. Then he saw it. The figure. 

	The figure, or death itself stared, not moving. Adam stared back. “I know.” is all Adam said to it. Death slowly glided towards him but Adam did not move an inch. Death lifted its boney arm and gently placed its hand on Adam's shoulder. It was comforting. It then pointed at his wife and Adam understood. 

	“Goodbye Honey…I love you so much. Fuck I’m so sorry. I'm sorry I did this to you.” Adam wiped away his tears and shakingly kissed the top of his wife's head. She stared at the contact and mumbled in her sleep. “I miss you.” 

Adam stood up caressing her face one last time. “Im going to meet our baby, Honey. We’re going to be okay. We’ll wait for you.

Adam walked slowly towards Death. They held hands and Death walked him to the door which had turned into a blinding light. Adam reached the door and stepped inside.

1on2wsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1on2wsy/death_is_like_a_never_ending_fever_dream/,Death Is Like A Never Ending Fever Dream,"	Adam awoke with a start. He looked down at his body, pulling the covers up. He was drenched in sweat. Adam groaned and got out of bed, holding his head in his hands. He had been having nightmares for the past few days; all of the same situation. He would fall asleep next to his wife Karina and then appear in a damp and cold room. It had wooden flooring that was obviously old and rotting. The walls were a dark green wallpaper that peeled at certain places. Adam would then open the dark brown door into the rest of the house.

	Adam is then greeted by a long hallway with the same flooring and wallpaper. Cobwebs covered every surface and the floorboards would creak and groan with each step, bending under his weight. As Adamn would walk down the hallway he would eventually see a bright white door that did not match the dilapidated surroundings. As soon as he would spot the door that seemed miles away he would turn around to see the presence of a ghastly figure. 

It wore a dark cloak that was torn to shreds. Its face, hidden in shadow. The figure would lift up its arm and point at Adam. Its hand was made of pure bone. It was slightly levitating off of the ground, however it casted no shadows. Adam would begin to run towards the door, to safety from this mysterious figure. He did not even want to find out if it was a friend or foe. 

The figure would begin chasing him at a steady pace. Adam would run as fast as he could but the door would grow farther and farther away. Eventually the figure would catch up to Adam and grab his shoulder or any part of his body it could reach. Adam would then wake up drenched in sweat and still shaking from his fear.

Adam stands up after processing his dream and letting the fear slowly drift away. He looks over to his wife Karina. They had been married for 7 years. They had no children. 2 years ago they had both been in a car accident which left Adam with several fractures and permanent back pain. Karina, however, was hurt the worst. She had lost the child she was carrying. Her body was permanently damaged from the loss and the physical trauma to her body from the accident. The doctor told them that she may never be able to have children again. They were devastated. Karina had only been 3 months pregnant. They hadn't even found out the gender or picked out a proper name.
Karina became a different person after the accident which Adam didn't blame her for. She rarely left the house. Sometimes she would go days without even looking at Adam.

“Its just painful to look at you sometimes,” she would say.

“I just remember that you were almost a father and I can't help but feel guilty that I can't make that a reality anymore. Sometimes I'll look at you and imagine what you would be like playing with our child. It just hurts sometimes to be reminded.”

Hearing her say that hurt Adam so deeply. He understood where she was coming from however. He would sometimes look at her and think about what could have been. He doesn't blame her for the accident or for losing the baby of course but sometimes it just hurts.


Adam walked into the kitchen and began making his coffee for the day. After finishing his coffee and watching a segment of the news. It seemed like today was going to be like the past few. Karina had been ignoring Adam once again. He decided to give her some space and try not to bother her. He assumed she was just upset about the past. Adam walked back to their shared bedroom but he heard Karina silent sobs. She would lock herself in their room occasionally and asked to be left alone. He walked back into the living room not wanting to make her more upset.

	Adam was off from work today and he decided it was a good opportunity to take a nap on the couch. He slowly drifted off to sleep. He opened his eyes to see the same green walks and brown door. He sighed, getting tired of having this same dream every time he closed his eyes. He opened the door once again and began a brisk pace towards the white door he knew would be up ahead. As it came into view he felt the presence of the figure behind him. This time he decided to try something different. 

“Who are you!?” Adam yelled at the figure. “What is this place and what do you want with me!?”. Adam continued hurling questions at the man only to be given no reaction. The figure stayed still however. Usually it would be chasing Adam by now. The two stared at each other before the figure spoke.

“Remember…” It whispered in a raspy voice.

“Rememebr what?’ Adam stared.

The figure then rushed towards Adam and before he could even react he awoke and fell off of the couch. As he regained his bearings he saw that it was now dark outside.

“What the hell? It was just 11am!?” Adam spoke aloud and glanced at his phone showing 7:23pm. 

Adam stood up and recalled what the figure had said to him. “Remember…” His head hurt. A throbbing pain in the back of his head. He stood up and brushed off his knees. He walked into the shared bedroom and saw Karina was asleep curled up on the floor holding one of his shirts. He smiled at her sleeping form and carefully picked her up. He placed her on the bed and tucked her under the covers. He kissed her forehead and whispered “Goodnight.” 

Adam walked into the bathrooms and finally took the shower he desperately needed after waking up twice covered in sweat. Afterwards, he changed his clothes and stayed up all night watching tv. He was terrified he would fall asleep. 

Adam never once closed his eyes that night. Once the sun came up he decided to get up and get ready for work. He called out a “Goodbye Honey! Love you!” to his wife before he left. She never came out of their bedroom. Once Adam got to work he parked his car. Strangely when he walked up to the automatic doors they didnt op[en for him.

“Huh? Weird.” Adam waved his hands at the sensor but nothing helped. He ended up having to wait for someone else to walk by and open the doors. He slipped inside giving a “Thanks I don't know why it wasn't working for me.” to the man that opened the door. However the man just ignored him. Adam scoffed and continued to his office space. He sat down and began his usual work day. 

His boss, Richard nor any of his coworkers seemed to acknowledge his presence. Adam thought maybe they were stressed or busy. He honestly didn't mind that much. At the end of the day he pushed out and walked again to the doors. They remained closed. Adam just sighed and walked to the other exit door that he could push open. 

He made his way home but when he parked he saw that his wife was closing the door coming out of the house. She was dressed in all black and tears were streaming down her face.

“Honey what happened? Are you ok?” Adam approached slowly and held his wife in his arms. 

Karina ignored him and kept walking towards her car. No matter how many times Adam called out to her she never even looked at him. Adam began to get frustrated. She had had her moments wanting peace but this seemed excessive. Maybe she was angry at him? He didn't know what he would have done to upset her.

I’m Martin, someone who truly believes that everything happens for a reason.

I’m starting completely from zero here in the Netherlands and would be deeply grateful for any support to help me get going.

I feel a calling to help people, but I’ve humbled myself enough to admit that I can’t help others unless I shine first. Life showed me rock bottom, and in the moment when you almost die, you realize what truly matters. That’s when your whole mindset shifts. Even a small contribution brings me joy, because a million is made of cents.

Right now I’m abroad, without money, rebuilding my life step by step. I see it not as a struggle, but as a new beginning, a chance to grow stronger and create a better future not only for myself but also for the people around me. Any support truly helps me move forward from the heart.

Through this experience, I’ve learned that when you act with clear intention and gratitude, life begins to move with you.

I share reflections on energy, mindset, and the law of attraction, how small shifts in vibration can genuinely change your path.

If this resonates with you, your support means the world… even a small coffee helps me stay grounded and keep sharing light.

I also offer short 1:1 sessions focused on self-development, energetic alignment, manifesting balance, and ADHD guidance. (pay what you can)

If you’d like to support me in any way, you can find the link in my biod.

I truly appreciate every single euro, it means a lot to me right now, more than words can say. 🤗🩵

I have a heart rate that goes from 60-115 doing really regular things ( brushing teeth, getting ready to take a shower, sweeping) even 130 if I'm having a rough day ( I wear a smartwatch daily). I had a holter monitor on for 48 hours a couple of months ago and everything showed up fine (heart structure wise). I don't drink regular coffee, I gave it up years ago due to it making me anxious, lightheaded, shaky, and nauseous and stopped drinking decaf earlier this year due to the same symptoms. No soda or energy drinks either. I've been having very bad fatigue the past 2 years so my physical activity has been severely limited. I get random goosebumps and body clenching that also come when i get too excited about something. I take 2 ferrous sulfate tablets daily to bring my ferritin up. I get off balance not too often but it happens, i walk around 3,000 steps daily (very low amount but i rarely go anywhere), I drink around 40 oz of water daily ( sufficient for my daily activity and I feel like puking if i drink anymore), I eat alot of bean, eggs, chicken, potatoes, pasta and meat. Also bananas, oranges, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and cucumbers. I try to eat healthy and stay hydrated to make sure I'm not told to ""eat better and drink more water""

what has been ruled out so far

\-hyperthryoid ( had hyper that became hypo because of thyroiditis and was told that my heart rate should not be elevated anymore)

\- anything heart related (holter monitor and doctor confirmed)

\-vitamin deficiency (had a full panel done)

  
what I've come up with as possibilities

\- dysautonomia ( i am a very anxious person and pots has been brought up by my primary care doctor but i dont think fit the criteria for it but i do believe my nervous system could be dysregulated)

\-deconditioning which was brought on by constanly feeling too ill to do my physical activiteis ( before all of this I had been working out frequently since grade school)

\- mold exposure ( our bathroom does'nt have the best ventilation but most of it has been cleaned )

\- some sort of infection ( chronic discharge that doesn't smell fishy but is strong. could possibly be from my thyroid hormones being out of whack)

\- not absorbing nutrition properly ( i have to eat 3 meals a day at the same time or i get light headed, weak , and disoriented. diabetes and hypoglycemia ruled out by finger pricking and a1c testing. been going on for 5 years)

I’ll explain in a second but let me start off by saying that everyone in life has had their moments where they stay up a bit too late or sleep in the next morning, but this guy takes it a step further on a day to day basis. He stays up all night every night on his phone watching movies playing video games etc and he will stay awake until 8 or 9 in the morning or sometimes even more and then he will sleep until 6 or 7 in the afternoon. It’s like he is truly nocturnal, the sun comes out he goes to sleep, it goes down and he’s awake, and even after he wakes up he looks at the clock and thinks he ought to get to bed soon because it’s late so he just goes back to bed and repeats the cycle of staying up all night. I feel like he makes no effort to actually go to sleep at night and he just figures he will sleep when he feels tired. He doesn’t even work a night shift job, although he only works 2 days a week it sounds like he has an extremely hard time staying awake during the work day. We will be hanging out and it’ll be 3 in the morning and after going out to the bars and partying all night he turns to us and goes “ok what’s the move?”. WTF the “move” is we go home and go to bed!! It’s already way past our bedtime and you want to continue doing side quests all night?! He treats it like it is just the middle of the day for him. I’ve never met a guy quite like him. I feel like just talking about him people will say I’m making this up but I promise it’s 100 percent real and if anything I’m playing down how bad it is. I want some advice on how I can help him, I’ve tried getting him to drink coffee or try to stay awake longer during the day to help shift his schedule but it’s like he is incapable of doing that. One time we got drunk at my house and then at 2 am he asked if I could drive him home. I was drunk so I told him he had to stay on my couch. The next morning he said his phone died at 3 am and he said he just stared at the ceiling until 7 am when finally fell asleep. I woke him up at 10 to take him home and it was like waking a literal zombie. I made him a cup of coffee and he said “no that will just keep me awake”. I thought that would be a good thing, staying awake longer in the day seems better than going straight back to bed and sleeping the rest of the day, but he was adamant that he’d be better off going home and just sleeping the rest of the day.",1,1762144893.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1on2r3m,https://jianwendi.blogspot.com/2025/11/CITYGATE1JPN2FOOD.html,Dining Experience: Shokudo Wara,"
Over the years, I haven't been very interested in dining options within shopping malls, but after visiting this place, I was pleasantly surprised.

When I arrived, it was early and almost empty. By the time I left during lunch hours, the place was packed, and there were many people queuing outside.

In terms of seating, just past the self-service drink area is the dining section, which offers various seating types. There are also designated spaces under the seats for bags, which is a thoughtful arrangement.

The interior is designed in a minimalist Japanese style, creating a relaxed dining atmosphere.

Upon entering, the drink area is in the middle, with the kitchen on the left and the cashier on the right.

Here, you can order using your phone and a QR code, and the food arrives quickly. However, you can also manually control the order of service, such as having desserts served only after finishing the main course.

The food is generally divided into three main categories: Japanese dishes, steaks, and desserts, with various sub-items.

This time, there were five of us: four adults and one child. For drinks, everyone ordered hot beverages, except for one chocolate drink for the child; the adults all chose coffee. For dessert, we shared a chocolate ice cream strawberry egg waffle.

In terms of food, there were Japanese set meals, steaks, pasta, and snacks. 

For snacks, we had salmon sashimi, chicken wings, and squid balls. I didn't eat the chicken, but the sashimi and fried items were quite good.

Regarding pasta, there were two types; I didn't eat the pasta itself but tried one of the side dishes, which was lobster. The lobster was quite fresh and cooked with cheese, which was delicious.

Now, about my lunch: I had a Japanese set meal that included steamed egg, fried chicken, udon, and salad as the basics. For options, I chose grilled beef, scallops, and foie gras rice. Including the snacks, there were a total of eight items. Each dish looked small, but by the end, I felt quite full.

Overall, I was very satisfied with this meal. The food quality and dining environment did not disappoint. This place accepts various payment methods, and the mall offers free parking for a certain amount of spending, making it quite convenient to dine here on Sundays.

His best friend (25) that he has known since they were babies, fell asleep in our room on the floor while we were watching a movie. I was the last one awake so I turned the TV off and went to sleep. I was sleeping right next to my boyfriend sound asleep when I started to feel poking around my backside. It was his friend. I didn’t think too much about it at first because this friend was someone I trusted and felt comfortable around. I had known his for 4 years since we started dating. I thought maybe he was looking for his keys or phone or something. He kept poking around for a while, I felt him poke my bum and around my legs and I started feeling uncomfortable so I scooted closer to my boyfriend. He waited for a few minutes then went down to the bottom of the bed. I sleep on my side so he positioned my feet one on top of the other. I again thought this was weird, but could never have guessed what was about to happen. He proceeded to stick his penis between my feet and instantly jizzed all over my feet. I was so in shock I kicked him as hard as I could and screamed WTF! He ran out of the room like a coward and hid between the coffee table and couch in the living room. 
I Woke my boyfriend up and told him what had happened. He started to cry and I asked him what he was going to do. He continued to cry and said he did it know what to do. I went out to the living room, flipped the lights on and started letting his friend have it. I told him to get out of my house and never come back again. I was crying and angry at the same time. All my boyfriend could say way, I’m sorry man she wants you to leave so you need to go! I could not believe he wasn’t ready to kick his ass or at least kick him out! All his friend could say is, I don’t know what happened I was asleep and he acted so tired like I woke him up. He tried to say he was sorry but I did not care I just wanted him to get out! 
The next morning he had sent my boyfriend several texts trying to convince him he had done this in his sleep and he didn’t know what he was doing. He sent 3 articles about men who have done things like this in their sleep but they were all married men who did things like dry hump their wives in their sleep. Nothing to this extent where he pulled his pants down and positioned my feet. After rethinking about what had happened I realized his initial poking and prodding was an attempt to put it between my legs or my butt. I explained all of this to my boyfriend but he wanted to believe his friend. When he chose to continue to hang out with him , not at our house but his friends house, I felt he had chosen his friendship over me and I was done. I broke up with him because I knew if he could hang out with him after what he had done to me and not even defend or protect me, I didn’t not want to be with that man child. He didn’t understand why I was breaking up with him over this and his friend house even tried to get me to change my mind and stay with him. He felt like this was not his fault but I wanted a man who I felt could protect me in such situations. AITA?",634,1762144117.0,AITAH,136,0.97,False
1on2j3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1on2j3j/how_do_you_go_out_if_you_dont_have_something/,"How do you ""go out"" if you don't ""have something""?","What do you do at a bistro, if you can't order something to eat? 

I live in a medium city in the USA in a convivial neighborhood that has several bistros and smaller restaurants within walking distance. They're mostly casual and are all very friendly. I love my neighborhood, I work from home, and I often take solitary walks just around the block as a stroll to clear my head. And in the evenings, I am often meeting friends who are heading to these locations. (It actually feels very European. Not typical drive to fast food American style.) 

Before I entered into the weight-loss journey, I would just stop off at one place or another and have, for example, a coffee and a danish, or maybe a small plate of appetizers, to keep me occupied for a half-hour while I was there. This feels like ""paying rent"" for the table where I could sit and basically stop to smell the roses. 

Now that I'm counting every bite that enters my mouth, I realize that I don't want to eat those absent-minded foods in that way. It's not exactly that I am denying myself the enjoyable foods -- if I want to go out for a nice restaurant meal, I'll still plan on it and do it. But rather, it's simply that a lot of those meals were not especially enjoyable. They were simply non-thinking add-ons to my regular eating, and the fact of reducing (eliminating!) them has been very beneficial for weight loss. I don't miss them. I don't crave bites at my corner restaurant.

But I don't have an ACTIVITY for being at the bistro. Aside from decaf coffee, there's really nothing for me to do when going out for a stroll in the evening that won't add extra calories. I feel like it's inappropriate to sit and order plain tap water and yet occupy one of their tables, the waiter won't even have anything to list on my bill. 

What can I DO at the restaurant, if not order food? I am at an impasse. ",9,1762144055.0,loseit,33,0.76,False

using fake names — i’m nico (31M, colombian/latino). my partner is samir (29M, iraqi, muslim).

it’s like almost midnight  and i’m doing the thing where you reread the same texts hoping they’ll say something different. they don’t. i keep landing on the same thought: i love this man. and i don’t know if i can do this anymore. And I have been at this for days…

We have  been together a little over a year and a half. when we met in Toronto, it clicked fast. he’s gentle in ways that sneak up on you — remembers my dog’s weird quirks, texts “home?” when it rains, kisses the top of my head in grocery store lines. I’m the planner type. I like routines and a sense that we’re building an actual life.

we’ve had our issues. I needed more consistency from him. showing up, following through, grown-up stuff. he owned it. i saw effort. I decided  to stay because the love is real.

There’s also the queer + muslim + family layer. he’s figuring out how to be himself without losing his people. I’ve always told him i love him as he is. we were learning how to be careful and still be honest. Even tho that im not religious or in the closet at all, I’ve been able to made peace with it.

Then i moved cities 3 months ago, not the other side of the planet, but far enough that the bed feels too big. we said long distance would be temporary. we said we’d visit and faceTime and keep the little rituals going.

he promised he’d try to move to my city. He really has tried. the problem is most jobs here need fluent french and he doesn’t have that yet. so it’s like there’s this one checkbox that keeps saying “no,” and every “no” adds another month to… nothing. just waiting.

So…. here’s my truth: i do not do well with “indefinite.” i can sit with hard feelings, i can compromise, i can forgive. i cannot live in a permanent “someday.” i’m a presence person. i want normal life — coffee, gym nights, walking the dog together, falling asleep in the same stupid position and complaining about it in the morning. i don’t want to love someone through a screen with no end date.

I poured it all out. i said i love you, i believe you, i see your effort, but i can’t keep doing this if there’s no horizon. and if this is years and years, i don’t know if i can survive it emotionally. that hurt to even write.

His response was calm and kind, which honestly just pissed me off more and I don’t even know why. he said he hasn’t given up on moving. he’s still trying. staying where he is right now isn’t about not choosing me; it’s about trying to build stability. he also said distance feels “normal” to him because he grew up with it — dad away for work, making peace with absence. so if he looks okay with long distance, it’s not that he loves me less; he is used to it ??? I still don’t understand as he has never had a long distance relationship.

I’m  slowly falling apart. he sees this as a tough season. i feel like i’m trapped in a waiting room with no clock.

I don’t have a plan. i don’t have neat bullet points or timelines. i have a mess of feelings and a love that is huge and a fear that i’m going to have to break my own heart to protect it. i keep thinking about breaking up purely because there’s no date, no path, no end — and that thought makes me physically sick. it’s like choosing to amputate something that still has feeling.

I’m latino so yeah, i feel everything too much, so for the past days we have just been arguing and fighting like fucking soap opera. we are both trying to be brave. but this open-ended distance is grinding me down.

so… reddit, please. if you’ve done long distance with no clear end, how did you survive it? how did you know when it was just a hard chapter vs a fundamental mismatch in what you both need? is it fair to say “same city within a real horizon” is a non-negotiable for my mental health? and for folks in intercultural/queer relationships, how did you keep love from shrinking under family and faith pressure without disappearing yourself?

i know we love each other. that’s not the problem. the problem is time — or the lack of an end to this.

Happy to answer questions or add more context … I don’t know I’m just lost right now

1on2gkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1on2gkg/i_answered_a_knock_at_my_friends_door_last_night/,"I answered a knock at my friend’s door last night, but the person outside was me.","When I look back, I can still smell the candle wax. Brandon’s girlfriend, Kate, had this habit of lighting five different scents at once, like the mix of vanilla, pine, and burnt sugar could disguise the fact that her apartment always felt too still. My girlfriend, Lila, teased her for it while the four of us sat around the coffee table eating take-out noodles and half-watching a movie while playing Uno. It was supposed to be a normal night.

I remember thinking how quiet the neighborhood was. The kind of quiet that makes you hear the hum of the refrigerator and the soft static between words. Brandon’s place sat at the end of a cul-de-sac, one of those split-level rentals with a narrow porch and a single security light that never stayed on.

We’d just started talking about weekend plans when the knock came. Three sharp raps. Not hurried, not tentative. Confident.

Brandon frowned, half-rising from the couch. “Expecting anyone?”

“No,” I said before I could stop myself. It wasn’t my house, but the sound felt directed at me.

The knock came again—same rhythm, a beat of stillness between each hit.

Kate looked at the door, then at Brandon. “Probably a delivery mix-up.”

But Brandon wasn’t moving. Neither was I. There was something about the cadence that made my stomach tighten.

“Relax,” Lila said, nudging me. “I’ll check.”

Before I could tell her not to, she padded across the living room and flipped on the porch light. It flickered once, then steadied. I caught a glimpse through the window—a shadow on the other side of the frosted glass. Same height as me.

Lila opened the door halfway. Then she froze. “Uh, Brandon,” she said quietly, “you might want to come here.”

He joined her at the entryway, confusion flickering over his face. Kate leaned over the back of the couch, but I was already standing. I don’t know what I expected—maybe a prank, a neighbor.

When I reached the door, the air felt thinner. The man outside looked exactly like me. Same jacket. Same haircut. Same tired circles under his eyes. Even the way he held his shoulders, slightly turned like he wasn’t sure whether to step forward or back—it was mine.

He smiled when he saw me. “Hey,” he said, voice perfectly calm. “Why’d you change the locks?” For a second, nobody said anything. My mind searched for an answer that made sense—twin, look-alike, some kind of joke.

Brandon muttered, “What the hell…”

The man outside tilted his head. “You going to let me in? It’s freezing.”

The breath left my lungs. “Who are you?”

He blinked, surprised by the question. “Funny. You tell me.”

I slammed the door before he could take another step.

The sound echoed through the living room. Kate yelped. Lila grabbed my arm. “What the hell, Matt?” “There’s somebody out there pretending to be me.” Brandon turned the deadbolt. “Okay, that’s… that’s insane. Maybe he just looks like you.”

“No,” I said. “You saw him. It’s not possible.”

From the porch came three more knocks—slower this time.

Lila whispered, “What if it’s a prank? What’s that thing called-deepfake or something?”

I shook my head. “He had my clothes. He even—he even talked like me. I don’t think my parents would be able to tell.”

The knocks stopped.

Brandon exhaled shakily. “I’m calling the cops.” He grabbed his phone and started dialing.

While he talked to the dispatcher, the rest of us stood there listening. No footsteps. No voice. Just that quiet house breathing around us.

When he hung up, he said, “They’re sending a car.”

We waited. Ten minutes. Fifteen. Lila peeked through the side window once but flinched back immediately. “He’s still there.”

I forced myself to look. Through the glass, my own face stared back at me. He was smiling faintly, like he found something funny. Then he raised his hand and knocked again, softer, steady, patient.

Brandon muttered, “Jesus Christ.”

When the police arrived—two officers—they found nothing. The porch was empty. The night air looked untouched, like it had been that way all along.

One officer asked if I’d been drinking. I told him no. He said they’d patrol the area, told us to lock up, and left.

We tried to laugh it off after that, but no one really could. Brandon suggested we all crash there for the night, just in case.

Around midnight, Kate went to bed. Lila lay curled against me on the couch, pretending to sleep. Brandon stayed up, staring at the dark TV screen. That’s when I heard it again.

A single knock. From the back door.

Brandon looked at me like maybe I’d imagined it. Then we both heard the second one—three taps, the same slow rhythm.

We crept into the kitchen. The small window above the sink looked out over the backyard. Porch light off. Darkness thick as velvet.

I whispered, “Don’t.”

Brandon ignored me and flicked the light switch. The bulb hummed to life, yellow and weak, casting a cone of light over the glass door.

I was standing outside again.

Same jacket, same posture, except now there was something wrong with the way I smiled. It was too wide.

He lifted a hand and rested it flat against the glass. The shape of it matched mine perfectly.

Brandon hissed, “How is he doing that?”

I wanted to answer, but my mouth felt dry. The thing outside leaned closer to the glass, forehead pressing gently until condensation fogged the pane.

Then he whispered something. We couldn’t hear through the door, but I knew the shape of the words. He mouthed: Let me in.

Brandon yanked the blinds closed. “Nope. We’re done. We’re calling again.”

But before he could reach for his phone, the kitchen light flickered and went out.

The power didn’t so much go out as hesitate. The hum of the fridge died, the clock on the stove blinked off, and the air itself seemed to thicken. I could hear Brandon’s breath beside me, shallow and fast. Then came the soft drag of a hand sliding down the other side of the glass door.

We backed into the hallway. Lila appeared, rubbing her eyes. “What’s happening?”

I started to answer, but a shape moved past the curtained window. A shadow—my own—brushed the fabric, the faint outline of a face pressing just close enough for the curtain to twitch. Then it was gone.

“Basement,” Brandon whispered. “Breaker box.” He headed for the stairs. Kate called from the bedroom, voice small, asking if everything was okay. No one answered.

I didn’t want to go into that dark stairwell, but standing still felt worse. I followed Brandon down, the flashlight on his phone cutting narrow slices of light across the unfinished walls.

The switch was already flipped to ON.

“See?” he said. “Power’s fine. Must be—”

Something slammed upstairs. Hard enough to shake the ceiling dust loose.

We bolted up the steps two at a time. The kitchen door was open.

Cold air poured through the room like water. The curtain flapped against the wall. Kate stood frozen in the hallway, hand over her mouth.

“He’s inside,” she whispered.

I saw the trail of wet footprints on the tile before I saw him—me—standing in the living room doorway, head tilted slightly, eyes unfocused. He looked like he’d forgotten how to breathe.

Brandon grabbed a lamp from the table and held it like a weapon. “Stay back,” he said, voice cracking. The thing turned its head toward him, slow as a hinge, and smiled. Not wide this time—sad.

Lila said my name. I don’t know which of us she meant.

For a heartbeat, everyone was still. Then the thing moved—fast, impossible speed, knocking the lamp aside, sending it clattering. Brandon shouted. Kate screamed. Lila pulled at my arm and we stumbled backward into the hall.

I remember flashes: the sound of something heavy falling, glass breaking, Brandon’s voice cutting off mid-word, his grunt as he hit the floor.

When it was over, the silence was worse than the noise.

The power blinked back on. The bulbs buzzed faintly overhead. The air smelled like ozone and sweat.

I was standing in the middle of the living room. My hands were shaking. There was someone on the floor at my feet, lying still.

He looked exactly like me.

The police came after Kate called them. I barely remember the sirens, just the questions. Where did the intruder come from? Why did he look like me? What happened to Brandon?

I kept saying, I don’t know.

One of the officers pulled me aside and asked again, slower, like maybe I’d stop lying if he softened his voice.

He pointed at the sheet-covered body. “You expect me to believe you don’t recognize him?”

I looked at the hand slipping out from under the sheet. Same scar across the knuckle. Same little freckle by the wrist. “I recognize him,” I said. “I just don’t know which one of us he is.”

They didn’t like that answer.

They kept me separated from everyone else for hours. The detective who interviewed me said the neighbors only saw one person through the window—the one who broke the glass. But when they showed me a photo from the scene, something about the angle felt wrong. The face on the floor looked peaceful, almost relieved.

Lila wouldn’t look at me when they finally let us speak. She just said, “They found you standing over him.”

“Over who?” I asked.

Her voice broke. “Over you.”

That was two days ago. I’m home now, waiting to hear if they’re going to charge me with anything. They said the body’s fingerprints match mine. Same dental records. Same blood type.

I’ve tried to remember every second of that night, but the details keep shifting. Sometimes I remember hitting him. Sometimes he hit me.

Sometimes I’m the one who ran, sometimes I’m the one who stayed.

When I look in the mirror, the reflection feels a half-second late again. Not enough for anyone else to notice—just enough for me to feel it.

There’s a noise I keep hearing at night, like a soft, even knocking somewhere in the walls. Three times, pause, three times again.

Lila hasn’t answered my calls. Kate says she’s not sleeping, that she’s scared of me now. I don’t blame her. I catch myself using words I don’t remember choosing, standing in rooms without recalling why I walked in.

This morning I found something in my jacket pocket that isn’t mine—a house key with a blue tag, the kind Brandon uses. I don’t know how it got there. The police said the man they found—the other me—had the same key in his pocket too.

I keep thinking about what he said through the glass. Let me in.

Maybe that’s what he was doing. Maybe one of us let the other in.

I don’t know which side of the door I’m on anymore.",1,1762143826.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1on2fja,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1on2fja/for_delaney_part_1/,For Delaney (part 1),"Hi! This is my first story, I hope you like it :) sorry if the formatting is weird, I'm new to reddit.

Warnings for alcohol abuse, pregnancy loss, and intense body horror.

I am writing this story for my sister because she deserves to be remembered. She deserves a lot more than what I was able to give her. Perhaps this is the only thing I have left to give - I will share her story as faithfully as my fractured memory can recall it. I hope that, somehow, we can both gain a little peace from these words existing. I love you, Delaney.

\~

Delaney and I came from a pretty rough family growing up. Our mother walked out on us when we were only 5 and 3, and as such I don’t have any memories of her, at least not any that I can be certain of. Just as sometimes photographs or stories shared with us can be reshaped in our minds as a memory that we ourselves never experienced, I don’t know for sure that my only memory of my mom is my own. “The angels have you.” I have a hazy memory of her saying that just before she kissed me and my sleeping sister as we laid stretched out on the couch on a stormy night, but perhaps this is only a manufactured memory. Laney would parrot it to me sometimes and always told me it was something our mother would say about us frequently. Like I said, she left us not long after that, and the odds of a 3-year-old remembering anything so specific are slim. 

Our dad was hardly around after that either, and when he was, he was often drinking himself into a stupor and bringing home a parade of women that reeked of cheap perfume and cigarettes. One of them once got so fed up with us sisters that she locked us in the only bathroom of our doublewide and our father didn’t find us until the following afternoon when he finally got home, still hungover. I hated those years there. Years spent screaming at our dad or intensely avoiding him as his addiction worsened. We spent as much time as we could out of the house, mostly just roaming the woods since neither of us had many friends, not that we would have ever brought them over to our shabby house anyway. We learned to be self-reliant, or at least Delaney did and I just relied on her instead, although of course the two of us still fought like cats and dogs pretty often too. 

Our dad only ever hit us once though, the time Delaney dumped all his liquor down the sink. She didn’t give him the satisfaction of crying when he struck her with the belt, but I never had the same control that she did and wailed like a baby until it was over. I was sulky at her after that because my childish logic couldn’t comprehend why I’d been punished for something I hadn’t even done, but she held me anyway and stroked my hair all night that night and promised that we would be ok. 

She got her first job and dropped out of school at 15 to try to work enough to support us. On more than one occasion, our father found her cache and cleared her out. I couldn’t even stand to look at him when he did that, and I quickly developed a rebellious streak a mile wide. Delaney remained diligent though and didn’t allow our father’s behavior to be a setback in her life, and she eventually saved up enough secret funds to get us out. Of course, we had stints of surfing the couches of our few close friends and their families, and a few stays in women’s shelters too. There was not much in my life that was consistent at that time, but somehow Laney always kept us together. She’ll never know how grateful I am for that.

It was remarkable how normal Delaney turned out to be. I know it’s cliché to say that someone’s smile lit up a room or their presence felt warm like sunshine, but that’s how she was. Her dearest love was to laugh and she gave so freely of herself to anyone that needed her. She actually graduated her online high school program early and with honors, and while she always hedged her accomplishment by saying her GPA wasn’t the highest, it was truly astonishing that she got it done at all with the way she was working herself to the bone in order to keep me in school. Of course, the stupid and ungrateful girl I was, I never appreciated it at the time. I had so much pent up hurt and anger, and I’m ashamed of how much I turned all of that onto her. While she never put up with my whiney, rebellious bullshit, she never seemed to take any of the awful things I said to her to heart and did the best she could to help me. I wish more than anything that I could go back to that time and do it over.  
  
Delaney had such a lovely, calming spirit, it’s no wonder she excelled at her work the way she did. She’d always had a way with kids and she’d been tutoring the grades below her for years, but when she started substitute teaching the summer after graduating, it didn’t take long for that to become the obvious track for her life. She started taking night classes to get her degree as a teacher and advanced quickly in that too. When she was 21, she snagged a great position at a brand-new elementary school a couple of states over and was thrilled at the opportunity to climb higher, especially since she would have the chance to work with kids that came from similar family backgrounds as we did. The school was in a relatively small town that had been run down for years, but in recent decades the locality had really blossomed with young families and vibrant new businesses. She was so excited.  
  
For my part, I was living my moody little life taking 2 community college courses at a time, working as a barista to support my weed habit, and kidding myself into thinking I could make it as film writer. I was certainly still delinquent, but not the unstable girl I had been for years up until that point, and I fully credit Delaney with whatever progress I was able to scrape up. I think we were both tired of me holding her back even if she never would have said it, so I tried to take her new job opportunity in stride and assure her that I’d be fine on my own.  
  
On the morning that she left, I helped Delaney pack up her little Corolla and reluctantly returned her earnest hug, telling her that she had nothing  to worry about and she’d obviously do great at the school. She tugged the end of my long braid in affection, the way she did when we were little. As I watched her drive around the bend, waving a hand behind her in the bright morning sun, I took ahold of the feeling that nothing would ever be the same and shoved it into the same festering corner that all my unwanted emotions went. And with that, I tossed my meager belongings into the bed of my shitbox truck and made my way to the dingy basement apartment that one of my friends was letting me crash at. I ended up joining the lease and staying there for the next couple of years, and while I wouldn’t say that my life was a complete downward spiral, there was very little that went upward for me.  
  
Delaney, on the other hand, thrived. She was beloved at work by teachers and parents alike and especially by the children she taught, many of whom she would help with assisted learning programs and gift with special treats that she paid for herself. I would often hear the heartbreak in her voice when she talked about children that were struggling with rough home lives.

“They’ll be ok, the angels have them” she’d say, her sad smile tracing through her tone. Sometimes I wondered if she was like our mother in that way, her resilience and empathy. She certainly had no trace of our father or his many vices. On the other hand, how empathetic could our mother have been if she was willing to walk out on her 2 young daughters? It had long made sense to me that no one would want to stay tied to my father for long, but the wound of being left behind stayed with me. It’s still with me even now.

After Delaney was settled and I was living on my own and working full time, I couldn't visit her very much. She was 4 hours away and incredibly busy too, so most of the time we would just catch up over the phone once a week or so. Sometimes she would call me out of the blue when she was excited to tell me something, which is exactly how I found out about Leo.

“You’ll never believe what just happened!” She exclaimed through the phone. 

“Hello to you too, Laney. Oh, I’m doing great thanks for asking.” I quipped more to myself than to her.

“I met the most amazing guy” she barreled on. “Someone hit me with their car today so I had to go to the emergency room, don’t worry I’m fine-“

“Woah woah woah, you got fucking hit by a car? What do you mean you’re fine? Is your car ok?”

“Oh, no I wasn’t driving. I was pulled over because there was a kitten in the road, SO cute by the way, a little rag-a-muffin like Momo, and I was just clipped a little bit by an old lady. I wasn’t run over or anything, she barely touched me honestly. And she was super panicked and apologetic, poor thing, it honestly was not a big deal at all. We were still in the school district so I don’t even think she was doing 20. Anyways-“

“No! Not ‘anyways’. Did you fall? Were you hurt? Was her car damaged?”

“Geez, calm down. Like I said, she barely hit me. She just sorta side-swiped me while my back was turned and hit me in the ass and so I-“

“Oh my god,” I cut in, cracking up. “You got hit by a car because your ass is too fat?”

She shushed me through her giggles. “Yeah, I guess that’s the price of cake these days.” She laughed. “*Anyways*, let me finish my story now, you cretin. So, I landed kinda weird on the curb and messed up my ankle a little bit, but I kept the kitten safe and the lady’s car was fine. She’s actually the sweetest - turns out her grandson is in my class and she insisted on bringing me to the hospital and then she practically begged me to come over for dinner and let her cook for me as an apology, so there’s that too. So, Mrs. Dobson drops me off at the emergency room and makes this big scene insisting that I need to be seen right away, meanwhile I’m just standing there looking completely normal, but the resident on shift comes out anyways to take a look. Oh my god, Cassi, he’s a total dreamboat, it’s kind of ridiculous. I felt like such an idiot sitting there while he was examining my leg, I kept on missing what he said to me because I was too busy being a stupid creep and just staring at him, to the point that he actually stopped and teased me about it.” She paused to groan in mortification at the memory. “But he was really sweet and professional, he put a boot on me and said it’s not broken, just a sprain. I was still holding the little kitten too, she’d fallen asleep curled up right under my chin, and he even took a look at her but she’s all good too, just a little skinny and has a few fleas. He was so, so cute with her too, it killed me.”

“Well, that’s good at least. Are you going to keep her?”

“Abso-fucking-lutely, are you kidding? I already named her Jetta, that’s what Mrs. Dobson drives.”

“Of course, you did.” I smiled with a shake of my head.

“So, this Dr. McDreamy is telling me to do ice packs for a few days and elevate and everything, and he says I can come back in after 2 weeks to see about removing the boot and switching to a brace, but then he says I can come back to see him sooner if I want to, and that coffee can help speed the healing process.”

“Good lord, what a cheeseball.” I cringed, shaking my head at her crazed giggles on the other line.

“Ugh, I know, I know. But I don’t know, I just have a good feeling about this one. He seems really sweet. Actually, there was a kid in the next bay over that I think had a broken arm or something and his dad was being a total ass to the doctor that was helping him, like not hearing a word she was saying and interrupting her constantly. So McDreamy excused himself and went over there and got the dad to calm down, he even got the kiddo to smile with the whole ‘well, son looks like we’ll need to amputate. What? You don’t need this arm, do you?’ routine.” She gave a shoddy impersonation of what I assumed to be McDreamy’s deep voice. “And then he told the dad literally the same exact thing the other doctor said, but of course the jerk didn’t argue back with him. I got the impression that happens a lot that doctor, but it was nice to see him check in and reassure her after. Anyways, when he came back over to me, he said it was unorthodox considering I’m technically a patient, but he asked if he could give me his number and I let him put it in my phone. I wanna give it a day or two I think, but…” I could practically hear her beaming through the phone, and she wasn’t one to go kicking her feet over every guy that looked her way, so something about the way she talked about him made me soften. 

“Well, I hope you guys have fun and he turns out to be a good one, then.” I said, rolling my eyes at her excited squeals as she gave a quick goodbye and rushed back into work. Delaney had dated a few guys over the years, none of them particularly endearing to me, but she was pretty good about holding her own if she didn’t like something they did. I could’ve learnt a thing or two from her in that regard; I was much more the type to go hopping from relationship to relationship, putting up with whatever came my way in the hopes that someone would stay.

But Delaney deserved so much more than that, and Leo truly stepped up to the plate and hit it out of the park. It was a while before I finally met him and when I did, I was prepared to have to be the rational one to burst her lovey-dovey bubble for yet another mediocre guy, but he really proved me wrong. He was tall, dark haired, and handsome like Laney had described and his eyes were a striking pale blue. I had imagined him to be somewhat stuffy and serious but he actually turned out to be quite goofy and charming and I couldn’t help but take a shine to him. It was obvious that he was absolutely smitten with Delaney, constantly brushing little touches of affection against her and looking at her with stars in his eyes, but he also made her laugh until tears streamed down her face and she caught her unmistakable case of the hiccups, a hallmark of some of our best memories growing up and usually something only she and I shared. 

Typically, such overt affection would gross out my little goth heart and I would relentlessly tease her, but this time, all I felt was a pang of sadness that she now had someone that was her person, the way she had been mine. I brushed it off and swept it into that dark corner of myself and told Delaney how happy I was for her, and I really was. Leo adored her and treated her like a princess; he sent flowers to her work, wrote heartfelt letters detailing all the little things he noticed and loved about her, made her food and rubbed her tired feet after long days at school. For her birthdays, he would call and coordinate surprises with me and her close friends, and he helped her to let go of some of her workaholic habits and actually enjoy life a little bit. They found a cute brownstone near the heart of the cute downtown area and moved in together after 2 years, and it was sweet to see how much she thrived with him. Of course, the constant stream of critters she brought home and begged to keep was a sore spot for Leo here and there with how orderly he was, but the man had a soft spot the size of the moon for her so she was rarely denied, if ever.   
  
Leo worked as a surgeon, which made them somewhat of an odd pairing. Delaney had taken some time off during her studies to care for our dad during his final decline from alcoholism – she’d been the one with him when he died because I couldn’t stomach to be around him anymore – and it had left her pretty averse to hospitals and death. She’d get pretty torn up about it whenever one of her students even had to visit the school nurse. But Leo would scrub the smell of blood and disinfectants from his skin every day and leave all the talk of what he did at the door. She told me that he often would get called in at odd hours or be gone for multi-day shifts and come back drained from things he didn’t want to talk about. But she was his sun, and he would come back and cling to her warmth until everything else, all the bad memories and stings of sadness, would melt away. She had that effect on people.  
  
Even so, they had their ups and downs too. During their first fall living together, I came to visit them for Thanksgiving break and I could tell something was up, but as we sat down in their overstuffed chairs after dinner and Delaney, brimming with a barely contained smile, passed me a coffee in a “World’s Best Aunt” mug, it clicked into place. I had barely processed the words before everything came bursting out of her. “Oh my god, Cassi! Can you believe it? It’s so crazy, it’s all happening so fast but I couldn’t be more thrilled! Leo too, we really can’t wait. I was absolutely terrified when I found out, completely unexpected and all, and actually I hadn’t had any symptoms up until that point, just a hunch, so it really came out of the blue. But Leo was so sweet and supportive of whatever I wanted to do, and when I really thought about it, it just felt meant to be... Well? What do you think?” She bit her lip and bounced back on her heels, waiting for my reply as I recovered from the shock.

“Wow, uh, that’s great! Incredible, really! I’m so happy for you Laney. You’re going to be an amazing mother.”

“Aww, thank you Cassi.” She beamed through brimming tears, planting a kiss on the side of my head and tugging the ends of my hair as I hugged and congratulated her. “And I know, right? I’m totally maternal material. It’ll be a breeze” she smirked.

“Congrats to you too, Leo. I’m glad she has you.” I said, offering Leo a somewhat awkward smile. He grinned and strode over, wrapping both of us in a bear hug that I returned with a series of pats to his back while Delaney giggled at my discomfort. “Thanks!” he laughed in his deep somber. “I’m the one that’s lucky to have her. It’s so unreal, we’re going to be parents!”

“Yeah, yeah. Ok, that’s enough mushy stuff.” I said as I wormed my way out of the group embrace. “Save that for the offspring.”

It was a tough pregnancy for Delaney. Only a few weeks in, she became sick so regularly that she had trouble working and had to go down to part-time, which didn’t help the toll it was already taking on her mental health. She suffered from intense nausea and dizziness, which she complained were brought on by awful smells that she couldn’t find the source of. Leo spent as much time with her as he could and, of course, catered to her every need by keeping her as comfortable and hydrated as she could manage. At the time, I was still chipping away at my degree and working full time so I wasn’t able to visit often, but Delaney took to calling me during my free time, sometimes not even to talk but just to have someone on the line with her. I’m not sure how much of a comfort I was to her, but I’m glad I could be there for her even in that small way. There’s so much more that I wish I could have done.  
  
I think she was about 18 weeks pregnant when she called me at 4am, sobbing and scared. “C-Cassi, somethings wrong. She doesn’t feel right” she said, her voice tense and gasping through obvious pain.

“Laney?” I asked, bolting upright as the instant adrenaline shoved all the sleep from my overtired mind. “What do you mean? What’s wrong?”

“The baby. S-something is wrong with her, it d-doesn’t feel right. I need help.”

“Ok, it’s ok. I’m on my way.” I said, throwing the light on and clamping my phone to my shoulder as I pulled on clothes as quickly as I could. “What are you feeling? When did it start?”

“I don’t know, I was sick when I w-woke up. It’s abdominal pain. It hurts so bad, it’s hard to breathe.” I could hear her panting as she moved around, I suspected she was writhing in pain. “And she - she feels cold, Cassi” she sobbed.

“What? What do you mean she’s cold? Is Leo with you?”

“N-no, no. He got called in last night, I tried c-calling but I can’t reach him, I think he’s in surgery.” She was crying in earnest now. I can still remember how helpless I felt on the other line, hours away and listening to her cry harder than she ever had even in our childhood. “She’s cold. She’s so c-cold. It feels like ice is stabbing me… Oh god no, there’s blood, I’m bleeding. Cassi, help me!” her cries through the phone may as well have been stabbing me too.

I stayed with her on the phone as she got herself over to her neighbors who were able to drive her to the hospital, and I hung up only briefly to call the hospital and inform them of what was going on and try to get someone to find Leo. Everything was a garbled mess when she arrived, but Leo rushed out and met her in the Emergency room when they pulled in. I could hear him comforting her and speaking with the medical staff, giving them updates on her pregnancy and expounding on her usual condition as they worked to stabilize her. The call was disconnected at some point and there was an agonizing 20 minutes where I couldn’t get through to anyone. Leo called me back at 5:30, sounding exhausted and shaken, and told me that Delaney was being taken care of and was not in any danger, but the bleeding had not stopped and he and the OB had determined that the baby was no longer viable.

“Ambridge said it’s just a matter of time” he said softly. I could hear the disassociation in his voice. “He doesn’t think we’ll need to step in based on how things are progressing, but there’s a possibility that I might need to.. to…”

“It’s ok, Leo. Thank you for the update, I’m glad she’s alright. I’m still a couple of hours out but I’ll be there before 8. Do you… need anything? I think the house may be a mess, I can go there first and clean up so she doesn’t have to see it if you want.”

“Yeah. Yeah, that would be good. Thanks.” He blew out a shaky breath.

“I’m sorry, Leo.”

“…Yeah.”

“She’s strong. She’ll be ok.”

“Yeah.” The conversation lulled for what felt like minutes, and I’ve never been good with grief so I just told him that I shouldn’t keep him any longer and I’d let him know once the house was clean. He breathed out a thank you and hung up.

The rest of the drive was a turmoil of wishing the phone would ring and also praying it didn’t. I arrived at the townhouse just after 7:30 and let myself in with the not-so-subtly hidden spare key. Their cat, Jetta, greeted me with sad, plaintive meows as she wound around my legs and stuck to me like Velcro as I looked around. The place smelled like dried blood, and while it had the same appearance as the cozy, slightly disheveled home I had visited in November, it now felt cast in a cold, eerie light. Somehow, the little creaks in the floorboards that used to signal a happy home where my sister danced like a dork to her old record collection now sounded hollow and echoey, like a haunted house. The pile of decorating magazines that Delaney had been clipping baby items from lay spread out on the coffee table, but it seemed staged, unnatural, like one of those dioramas behind the glass of a museum. Upstairs, her water glass that had been filled with ice only hours ago still sat on her nightstand, the condensation pooled around it like a mortal wound. I stripped the bed and got to work on soaking the stains from the linens in the tub and wiping up the drips of red that were scattered across the bathroom tile. Even over the pungent bleach, I could still smell the blood, thick and metallic, like it was clinging to the room and hanging in the air. Jetta hid under the bed.  
  
I worked my way through the house, straightening and dusting as I went, and stopped to scrub little pools of blood that had settled into the stair runner or in the cracks of the floorboards. I washed the bedding and put fresh sheets and blankets on and then came downstairs to tidy the kitchen. Even there, the smell permeated and I couldn’t escape the memories of Delaney’s desperate cries that her baby had gone cold inside her. I tossed what was probably 2 weeks’ worth of moldy food from the fridge. It was clear that Delaney hadn’t been able to bring herself to eat much with how sick she’d been, although I could tell that Leo had been trying to tempt her with some of her tried and true favorites, to not much apparent success. I poured Jetta’s breakfast into her bowl by the back door, but she remained hidden under the bed upstairs. I figured she was probably traumatized from witnessing Laney too.   
  
I walked to a café a few blocks away, grateful for the cleansing cold of the February air. I picked up some coffee and muffins and returned to knock on the neighbor’s door, the ones Delaney had said drove her to the hospital. The sweet, motherly-looking woman cracked the door and peeked around the frame, offering a nervous smile when she saw me standing there.

“Hi, um, Mrs. Ramone? I’m Delaney’s sister, Cassandra. She told me that you helped her last night so I just wanted to say thank you.” I said, smiling and raising the brown paper bag and carboard carrier of coffee in suggestion. 

“Oh, si, thank you.” She responded shyly, glancing over her shoulder before leaning out past the door frame, keeping the door held snuggly against her. “Your sister, she is okay?”

“Um, I’m not sure yet.” I admitted, blinking away the sudden annoying sting in my eyes. “She’s stable and being taken care of, but I don’t know yet when she’ll be allowed to come home.” Mrs. Ramone nodded sadly, then added quietly, “she will be alright, the angels have her.”

I frowned in confusion at the familiar phrase, but my question died in my throat at the sudden yell that came from somewhere behind Mrs. Ramone. A man called out to her in agitated-sounding Spanish and she responded quickly in soft explanative tones. The man yelled back what I recognized to be a string of expletives even with my years-old high school level Spanish, then I could hear his stomping footsteps retreat further into the house and the sound of a TV playing noisily from a distance. Mrs. Ramone looked back at me with embarrassment tingeing her expression, still keeping the door held mostly shut around her, so I smiled in what I hoped was a reassuring manner.

“Um, I know that Delaney was pretty unwell last night and she said she’d been bleeding. If there’s any mess or damage to your car, I’d be happy to clean it today.”

“Ah, no Mija. Do not worry, there is no mess.”

“Are you sure? It’s no troub-“

The man’s voice cut in with another yell, startling us both. It still sounded like he was in another part of the house, but Mrs. Ramone could no longer get a word in edgewise to placate him. After several seconds of waiting for him to settle back down to no avail, she turned back to me with a small apologetic smile and began backing away behind the door. “No, thank you Mija.” She said meekly, waving her hand at the coffees and pastries. “Tell Delaney I pray for her.” She slipped out of sight and shut the door firmly in my face, muffling the ongoing yells. I stood there bewildered for several moments, listening for the sounds to die down, which they did eventually, although the silence left an even deeper hollowness in my stomach as I slowly descended the stairs of their front stoop.

I called Leo twice and left a message but didn’t hear back from him. The charge nurse at the hospital confirmed when I called that everything was alright, Delaney was still stable, but she did not have any indication of when she’d be released to come home. I wasn’t sure if I would be allowed or wanted at the hospital so I sat in the chair by their front window and tried not to worry, but the effort produced a pretty wicked migraine.   
  
Leo called a quarter after 1 and said that everything was done, they would just be keeping her there overnight to make sure she didn’t come down with an infection, but she’d been asking about me and I was allowed to come visit. When I arrived, I found Leo leaving her room and we hugged each other for a brief moment. He had dark circles beneath his usually bright eyes and was wearing scrubs, the same from his interrupted shift in the ER or some given to him to change into sometime during the night, I wasn’t sure. Regardless, they were hopelessly wrinkled and smelled far from fresh. I could feel the exhaustion radiating from him. He gave me a solemn nod without meeting my eyes, and then he walked off down the hall.  
  
Inside, Delaney was lying on her side, her dark auburn curls sticky with sweat and clinging limply to the edges of her face, and her hazel eyes were red-rimmed and puffy from crying. She gave me a watery smile as I squeezed her hand and brushed her hair off her face. Growing up, we had often been told we looked like carbon copies of each other and people sometimes even thought we were twins, but in adulthood, I had ended up a few inches taller and at the time, I was dyeing my long curls black and straightening them into submission daily, so the resemblance only remained if you looked closely. But that day, she didn’t look like any version of herself that I had known. She looked beaten.   
  
“Think you’d want anything to eat?” I offered weakly, my heart falling even farther as she shook her head. Personally, I would have wanted a stiff drink in that situation, but I knew better than to make such a suggestion to Delaney. She’d sworn off the whole concept after witnessing what our father did to himself. “Want me to stay with you or would you rather be al-“

“No, no. Stay. Please.” She pleaded, squeezing her eyes shut and gripping my hand. “I.. I don’t want to be by myself.”

“Ok, that’s ok.” I said, moving around to the other side of the bed so I could sit beside her. I sat there with her for a long time, stroking her hair, sometimes tugging the ends as she so often had done to mine, and telling her about the mundane things that had been happening at work and the different assignments I had been working on that semester. Sometimes, her eyes would stare unblinkingly for so long and she would listen so quietly that I would think she had fallen asleep before she’d twitch abruptly, always asking that I keep talking. Sometimes, her breathing would become erratic and her shoulders would shake, but I let her have her privacy and didn’t push her to tell me how she felt.

The hospital felt cold and clinical, as most do, but her room felt especially heavy as I watched the slivers of weak winter sun slide slowly across the speckled tile floor. The smell of ammonia and antiseptic was strong, sometimes intermixed with the scent of cheap coffee and industrial laundry detergent when the door would open with the nurse’s comings and goings, but over everything was still the sharp, lingering tang of blood. 

The sun had long since set by the time Delaney was finally willing to have a few spoonfuls of soup. Leo came back a little while after, pressing a kiss to her forehead and stroking a thumb across her knuckles, as he offered to help her shower off and get ready to sleep. I stepped out to pick up a few of Delaney’s favorite snacks  at the gas station, but when I checked my missed calls, I found half a dozen from my very pissed off boss for whom I’d been a no-call, no-show. I mentally kicked myself and left a message explaining where I was and what had happened and promised to be back on shift the following day. I scanned my items haphazardly and stuffed them into a smiley face grocery bag before rushing back out the door.

A low-riding car slunk past the pumps as I hurried back to my car and I rolled my eyes as I heard the windows slide down and the occupants began their chorus of whistles and catcalls. “Hey sweetheart, why don’t you come let us show you a good time?” one crooned, the others laughing and goading him on.

“I was having a much better time before you dipshits showed up, so how about you just leave me alone, okay *sweetheart*? Or I promise, I can think up some *real* fun things to do that I’d bet you’d be far less interested in.” I bit back. 

The dipshits in question gave a mixture of laughs and unintelligible whooping responses as they slowly pulled away from my car. One of them in the back seat threw a crushed empty can out the window in my direction, and although his aim fell pathetically short and the can clanked harmlessly on the asphalt, I was left uneasy by his final remark. “Fucking bitch will find out soon enough.”

I yanked my car door open, my indignation solidifying into a cold, embittered rage, but I paused as it became clear the dipshits had found another target. A woman was exiting the gas station from a door on the opposite side of where I’d gone out, the hood of her oversized hoodie pulled up over her tangle of hair and dark smudges of old eyeliner encircling her uncertain eyes. Her pace faltered as the low rider cruised into her path. She gazed intently at the stained pavement and turned to the side in avoidance, but made no further attempt to move away. I watched with rapt attention as the dipshits went on hollering at her, equal parts objectifying her and pleading for her to join them. 

“Come on, baby, just get in the car. Look, I’ll even make room for you up here with me.” One called with an arrogant smirk and an exaggerated smack on his knee. The woman seemed frozen in place, but I could see her hands working nervously through the fabric of her hoodie pocket. She looked up and we made eye contact from across the small parking lot, her expression strained and blood-drained. Then, as if in response to the now demanding voices of the dipshits, her face became a mask of impassivity and she turned to the car and strode towards it, then reached out and grasped the handle of the nearest door to a chorus of victorious jeers. 

“Wait!” I called out in confusion. She halted her movements but did not look back at me. “Do you know those guys? You don’t have to go anywhere with them.” Hand still clasping the door, she twisted to look at me, her face mostly obscured by her hood so that I could only see one of her eyes. “Yes, I do.” She said simply, flatly. Then, she opened the door and climbed in, accompanied by the sound of their laughter as the door was slammed shut behind her. A few stray insults were lobbed at me, and then they turned up the window-rattling, bass heavy music and pealed out of the lot, the one that had thrown the can flipping me off as they rounded the corner out of sight.

When I got back to her room, Delaney was already back in bed and had been given some meds to help her sleep, so I gave her a quick hug and told her that she could always call me whenever she needed to talk. Leo was going to remain with her so I offered to go check on the cat again before I left for home, and he said “That’s great, thanks again. You should really get some sleep too before you head back out. You’ve had a long 24 hours too.” I reluctantly agreed and made my way back to the townhouse a little before 10, already fighting sleep on the drive across town, even as my mind continued to race. 

I was once again greeted by Jetta meowing at the door, but this time I had to scoop her up to keep her from running out of the house. She wriggled free and bolted under the couch and not even the can of food I cracked open could tempt her back out, not that I could blame her. It no longer smelled of blood, but the house felt barely warmer than the frigid February wind outside. I couldn’t find any obvious reason for the draftiness, but despite the thermostat being set to 67, I still shivered in my clothes and watched my breaths melt away in wisps of steam. I scraped out the ashes from the old, cracked brick hearth and built a fire as best I could, which soon began crackling cheerily and slowly warmed the oppressive cold. I set an alarm on my phone for a few hours out and curled up on the sofa, pulling a warm old quilt up to my chin as Jetta finally resurfaced and crawled into the narrow gap behind my back, a welcome warmth against me. 

I slept fitfully and awoke bleary and confused, my eyes burning like I’d been staring into a bright light. I suspected the long proximity to Jetta had caused my childhood allergies to flare up. The fire had burned down to a few glowing embers and I could see a few small strands of smoke snaking up the chimney. It was still dark outside and the alarm had not yet gone off, but I figured I needed to leave anyway if I didn’t want to succumb completely to my usual comatose sleep-state and miss the alarm entirely, so I forced myself up, stretching and rubbing away the ache in my eyes. Then I froze.

Somewhere nearby, Jetta started growling, deep and low. I felt the hairs on my arms and the back of my neck stand on end, my fingertips prickling with a sudden all-encompassing sense of dread. I slowly began scanning the room around me, my heartbeat pounding in my chest and ears as the shadows seemed to warp and stretch around the corners of the focal point of my vision. A wave of nausea gripped my stomach and I fought the bile rising in my constricting throat, paralyzed by a deep, sourceless fear. I could feel eyes on me but I couldn’t pinpoint from where, it felt like it was all around me, piercing through my clothes, flesh, and bones to my bare soul beneath.

Then it was gone as quickly as it came. All of the tension released from my body and I let out a heaving breath, tremors still racking my system. I reached up, swiped away the trail of a tear that had run down my face, and pressed a hand to my forehead that was slick with sweat even though I felt chilled. I turned the lights on and shakily looked around the first floor, not even certain what I was searching for, and found nothing. I could see nothing out of place and no apparent reason for the sudden overwhelming fear. I tried my best to shake the feeling off and rationalized that my mind must just have been exhausted, with an over-caffeinated and over-active imagination, and all the heaviness of the previous 24 hours had gotten to me. Of course, the one major hole in this naïve justification was Jetta, who was still trembling and hiding under the couch, her fur fluffed up, ears flattened, and eyes wide in fear.

I knelt by the sofa for several minutes trying to calm her down and entice her back out. Eventually, she crawled her way towards me and let me pick her up, but her claws dug into my sweater as she clung to me and snapped her gaze alertly around the empty room. I texted Leo that the cat was pretty stressed out but that I needed to get back on the road. He responded quickly that he would come back to check on her in an hour or two and drop her off at a friend’s house until Delaney was discharged if she was still behaving strangely.  
  
The drive home was exhausting and I still managed to arrive late to my shift, and despite my explanation and haggard appearance, my boss still fired me that day. I couldn’t really blame him, I was less than enthusiastic about working there to begin with and the massive stick up his ass made it even more unpleasant day to day. I didn’t burden Delaney with that information though when she called that evening to tell me she’d been allowed to go home, nor did I tell her about the strange, dark experience I’d had at her house. She sounded sad, hollow. In fact, I don’t think she ever really sounded completely like herself after that night. ",2,1762143736.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
