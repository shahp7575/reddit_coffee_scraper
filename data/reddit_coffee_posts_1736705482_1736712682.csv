Having said that I am still at 0 Stars for the Bath Kiosk, Deep Fryer, Fondue Pot, Donut Maker

and 1 Star for the Oils lab, 2 Stars for the Coffee Kiosk, 2 Stars Smoothie Mixer

Most of my machine like Smoothie Mixer, Taco Kitchen, Omelet Station, Sandwich Bar, Hot Dog Stand, Pasta Kitchen, Sushi Bar run 24 hours a day.

Is it just me but I don't see the end to get 3 Stars on Bath Kiosk, Deep Fryer, Fondue Pot, Donut Maker, Oils Lab?

Since I'm still working on these machines: Smoothie Mixer, Taco Kitchen, Omelet Station, Sandwich Bar, Hot Dog Stand, Pasta Kitchen, Sushi Bar, I use a lot of products to keep them running 24 hours a day.

If I have extra chocolate bars and StrawberriesI will make couple Chocolate Fondue a week. I have 6 Cheese Fondue and 6 Bacon Fondue so I will make some when I get low.

For the Deep Fryer I made 7 Hand Pies, in case I need them for trucks, boats or Town and when I have extra potatoes and bacon I make Bacon Fries, but again that's 10 a week.

For the Oils Lab I run it if I have extra Chamomile, Ginger or Mint. But again since it takes 10 to 20 minutes to make I can't run it 24 hours a day like other machines

Bath Kiosk is the same, I made 5 of Honey Soap and 5 Lemon Lotion until I use them and will make them again. But I use this machine maybe once a week.

This week I'm trying to use more the Donut Maker but, again, it only takes 30 minutes to make a Crunchy Donut so I make couple a days and that's it.

I just unlocked the Preservation Station and this one is already running 24 hours a day since it takes 4 hours to make Pickles. I love it.

So if you are in same boat as me and still working on mastering a lot of machines, do you just give up on the Bath Kiosk, Deep Fryer, Fondue Pot, Donut Maker etc?

Or you make a bit here and there and in 2 years you will Master your machine?",1,1736712534.0,HayDay,0,1.0,False

I get up every few hours because of pain. This morning at around 5:30 I was in horrible pain and didn't even think I could fall back asleep, so I went to the living room and got my heating pad going and  got all positioned with cushions and throw blankets. I fell back asleep üò¥ and it was lovely. 

My husband has in the past complained that this interrupts his sleep, especially if I make pain noise. So I have on occasion, when I am in a lot of pain went and slept on the sofa.

My thought process is that this fixes his problem. 

At around 8:30 this morning I woke up for the day (yay I got to sleep in for once), I made a coffee and was scrolling when my husband got up.

Instead of saying good morning and starting our Sunday like normal he proceeded to get mad at me for him having to sleep by himself. I told him I was up super early from pain and didn't want to disturb him so I went and slept on the sofa. He didn't acknowledge that and acted like I was just abandoning him to sleep by himself. 

I am very confused. I reminded him that he said it disturbs his sleep. He got mad at me saying that.

1hzvheo,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1hzvheo/f4f_would_love_to_explore_these_prompts_with_a/,[F4F] Would love to explore these prompts with a detailed partner ,"Reddit chat only

I came up with a few of these prompts that I'd love to play with someone, so if you're interested, don't be afraid to send me a chat. The roles can always be reversed. You could be the monster, and I could be the human, etc. Also, if you're wondering about being detailed enough, I usually send paragraphs a response, but of course, it depends on the flow of the roleplay. Then again, I like quality over quantity ^^

Plot 1: It was safe to say that I was raised in a pretty wealthy family, large house and I got most of the things that I wanted growing up from my father. But as I got older the truth of our wealth was much clearer especially since our father wanted us in the business: the mafia business. I was horrified when I first got the offer, angry at the thought that I believed my father hot all his wealth from some company he ran yet he'd never even tell the details. I can't say the same for my 2 brothers who agreed almost immediately, suck ups. I agreed eventually but I didn't like what I was or what I was doing, ever since 16 I've felt very..out of place. For right now, I was heading to my nearby caf√© with the bodyguards that have to watch my even movement whenver I'm not home; overbearing I know, my father's idea. When I entered however I noticed a girl behind the counter laughing with another employer, now many girls have caught my eye but this one was different, felt different. Im never nervous but just walking up to the counter made my heart race, after I ordered my coffee and had a horrible attempt of getting to know her, I was outside holding my cup in defeat until I had an idea. I told one of my  bodyguards to follow her, discreetly of course just to try get an idea of what she liked or where she went after work. I had to see her again

Plot 2: I was a monster. For some context, it's been around a decade since the outbreak, a deadly parasite swiping the world either bringing blood thirsty hybrids to roam or infection living humans and essentially turn them into hosts for the parasites. House and shops were raided with greenery, most being inhabited by the bugs that have grown larger due to the environment as the cars once owned by people abandoned to forever sit in place. Of course, there were still pathways that Earth couldn't grow through, but they were very run down and covered in potholes and cracks. There were of course survivors, alliances being made and places some couldn't cross, afraid of being killed for trespassing; leave it to the human species to betray and kill each other when the world is run by flesh eating parasites huh? Then there was me, I started out normal, obviously, but it's just my luck to get infected. I looked human but I wasn't..it was a few years ago when I was looking for food when I was bitten by an infected dog, or what looked like a dog, now that I think about it I don't even think it was a dog. My veins grew darker and I assumed that I was going to die but I lived,however the cost being that my body mutated with the parasite, my dna almost binding with it as my hands, feet and parts of my face were marked with black. I was a freak, the host of a curse, made to live in the shadows. It wasn't until I bumped into an actual person, and she was beautiful..

Plot 3: You were the princess of a distant yet wealthy land, doing everything that was asked and expected from you ever since youth but that wasn't what you truly wanted. You craved knowledge of the rest of the world and what everything looked like. Your sense of direction and ability of direction not being unnoticed as your ladies of honours would even mention how well you can navigate yourself even if you dont know where you were. Constant newsletters of people finding new land or seeing new things you wished that it was you and yet you knew that you couldn't go, you couldn't go and let down your country as the only daughter of the monarchy. Your coronation was to be soon, which also happened to be your 18th birthday, your crowning in front of almost every citizen in town as they embraced you as their queen, but of course, things took a turn. You were wandering the city, surrounded by knights that have to follow you every time you left the palace; overbearing, but you got used to it eventually. You were standing by a market when you noticed an unfamiliar ship docking by the pier and three people walking off; two larger men and a woman. Her face just seemed so familiar, and yet you couldn't think of it. However, time eventually moved fast and it was the night of your coronation wheresinging and dancing was every turn, the only peace and quiet being on the balcony but even then you were disrupted by the voice of a woman

Lately, I've been reflecting on how far we‚Äôve come, and I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder: **What‚Äôs a goal you‚Äôre proud to have achieved recently?** üéØ Whether it‚Äôs that little victory or a monumental life change, let‚Äôs celebrate those wins together!

I'll start with mine. üí™ So, I always struggled with sticking to a morning routine. *Anyone else not a natural-born early bird?* üê¶ Hitting snooze felt like a reflex more than a choice. But, I decided to tackle this one step at a time, and lo and behold, I‚Äôve finally managed to **ditch the snooze button habit** and keep to a consistent 6 AM wake-up time!

**Here‚Äôs what helped me stick with it:**

- **Finding my ""why"":** I realized I needed a compelling reason to get up earlier (besides, you know, just feeling like an adult). For me, it was having some quiet ""me time"" before the world starts buzzing.
  
- **Tiny adjustments:** I didn‚Äôt overhaul my entire schedule overnight. I just set my alarm 15 minutes earlier each week. *Small steps, folks!*

- **Accountability buddy:** I teamed up with a friend who was also on a mission to crack the code of the morning people. We checked in on each other, mostly with memes but hey, it worked! üòÇ

Any surprises? I discovered I actually love mornings! Or at least they‚Äôre tolerable when the coffee‚Äôs strong and the music‚Äôs upbeat. üé∂‚òïÔ∏è

But enough about me. I‚Äôm wondering, **what goals have you guys crushed lately?**

- Did you finally read that book you‚Äôve been ‚Äúabout to start‚Äù for months?
- Maybe you tried a new hobby that doesn‚Äôt involve Netflix or snacks. üòÇ
- Or perhaps you took time to focus on self-care in this hectic world.

Our journeys may look different, and that‚Äôs what makes them interesting. Celebrate those milestones, no matter how big or small, because they all matter!

Looking forward to hearing your stories and, who knows, maybe getting inspired for my next big endeavor. üöÄ Let‚Äôs keep maximizing our potentials together! üôå",1,1736711468.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

The rest of the new recruits sat around a fire, eating beans just like all good cowboys should. Problem was they weren‚Äôt cowboys and this was stunt man school. Of course women could join and the percentage cut was around 60/40 to the men. Not enough to satisfy the most hardened woke leftie yet it was progress on ten years ago.

¬†

‚ÄúHey Sid‚Äù asked Ryobi Makitura who had flown out all the way from Japan to fulfill his dream like they all had. Sure it had upset his banker heritage family yet Ryobi never played by the rules. No one in stunt school did.

¬†

‚ÄúYou heard the story about Wild Bill‚Äù? Ryobi ate more of his beans and ate with his mouth open which pissed off every Westerner in the group.

¬†

Sid brushed off more of the sand.

¬†

‚ÄúNo‚Äù.

¬†

Ryobi leaned forward. His face illuminated in the fire.

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs dry and crusty old Stuntman. He kidnaps new recruits off movie sets and they are never seen again. He‚Äôs pissed off with Hollywood. Something about not enough credit. He does bad things.‚Äù

¬†

Sid took a long sip of his coffee.

¬†

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard that one before.‚Äù

¬†

Stacey put down her plate. She went and kicked out the fire. The stars were bright and an astronomers and astrologers dream. The team said goodnight as the cool desert winds blew more dust into their eyes as they rested them after a very long hard day.

¬†

¬†

Sid woke up. He couldn‚Äôt see anything and realized he was blind folded. He hands were tied behind his back in what felt like a harsh abrasive rope. He felt he was on solid ground yet the ground was flexible and bendy.

¬†

*What the!!*

¬†

‚ÄúWalk the plank‚Äù came the voice over the loud speaker.

¬†

Sid didn‚Äôt recognize the voice.

¬†

‚ÄúStop playing pranks on the plank you bunch of smartasses‚Äù yelled Sid.

¬†

‚ÄúThe prank is on you, you have 20 seconds to walk that plank. Otherwise that pirate ship you are currently standing on goes up in thirty seconds. You signed up to be a stuntman. Now be a stuntman.‚Äù

¬†

Sid took one small step. He kept walking until he fell off and smashed into the water. His blindfold came off. He wiggled out of the binds and ripped the rope off his ankles. He noticed a shadow in the water. A long big dark shadow. ¬†A giant great white shark was heading towards him.

¬†

Sid turned around yet was blocked by the hull of a boat. He could see one of the panels was loose and ripped off a wooden plank. The Shark bore closer. Sid shoved the plank in the creatures mouth as he swiveled out of the way.

¬†

Sparks flew out of the shark‚Äôs mouth and it smashed headfirst into the hull of the ship. Then descended into the depths of the water. Bolts of energy flew out of it‚Äôs mouth and eyes. Sid swam to the top. He broke the surface and gasped for air.

¬†

‚ÄúWell done, you have passed the first test. To get out go to the door marked 18 and dry ¬†yourself off.‚Äù

¬†

Sid looked around. He was in a giant tank. With the pirate ship being it‚Äôs main feature. He swam to the ladder and noticed a Japanese style bamboo folder to give him some privacy. He changed clothes into a fire suit and helmet. He left his wet clothes behind and noticed an ankle bracelet on this leg.

¬†

‚ÄúYou mess with that and your leg blows off‚Äù came the audio warning.

¬†

Sid opened the hanger door.

¬†

In the next room he saw a giant piece of scaffolding and a large rubber of inflated mats.

¬†

‚ÄúGet to the top and Jump, the height is set to equal the world record. I sure hope you aren‚Äôt scared of heights.‚Äù

¬†

Sid went to the edge of the large white ladder. He looked up. He had never seen a jump so high in his life. He started up the stairs. Thinking of way he could get that bracelet off his leg. What if the guy was bluffing?

¬†

Sid looked down, he couldn‚Äôt believe he had climbed this high. He kept ascending the ladder. He reached the top and climbed on top of the platform. He saw small table with a note.

¬†

*Light yourself on fire*

¬†

He noticed a dummy right next to him behind a Perspex shield. It had a note on its chest.

¬†

‚ÄúIn case you were wondering‚Äù?

¬†

A small explosion went off, the leg exploded below the knee.

¬†

‚ÄúStarting to get my drift‚Äù echoed the voice.

¬†

‚ÄúJokes over, Ha Ha. Can I go back to camp or even go home now? I didn‚Äôt pay for this‚Äù cried Sid.

¬†

Sid Cole hugged himself.

‚ÄúWelcome to showbiz‚Äù the voice crackled over the loudspeaker.

¬†

Sid shook his head and doused himself with the lighter fluid. He picked up the lighter and lit himself on fire and jumped.

¬†

Sid tumbled and screamed. He hit the giant inflatable pads. The fire started to touch his skin. He bounced off the mat and saw a fire extinguisher with a giant hand written sign on it saying *USE ME.*

¬†

Sid grabbed the extinguisher and put out the fire on his body. White foam went all over the floor.

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right use meHollywoodand spit me out‚Äù cackled the voice.

¬†

Sid pulled off his helmet.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done nothing to you‚Äù screamed Sid.

¬†

‚ÄúNOTHING‚Äù!

¬†

There was silence on the vast soundstage.

¬†

Another door thrust open as light poured in.

¬†

Sid grabbed his helmet and walked outside.

¬†

He was outside in the desert, the gleaming sun hitting him right in the eyes. He noticed another table. He walked over to his and picked up the small ear pieces. He took off his helmet and put them in both ears.

¬†

The audio picked up and it was the same voice as before.

¬†

‚ÄúOn the road there are two cars. A Green Mustang and a Black Dodge Challenger. You drive the Mustang and I will drive the Challenger. If you know your film history they are exactly the same cars used in the Steve Mcqueen action epic Bullit. Your car is rigged to explode if you can‚Äôt get to town in five minutes. I will be doing everything in my power to stop you. If you make it back to town you get to live and I wish you well in the industry.‚Äù

¬†

Sid picked up the keys with a silver Mustang key ring.

¬†

The desert winds hit him in the face, for once a cool breeze. An eagle soured in the sky. He took that as a good omen. He opened the car door and started the car. He looked in the rear vision mirror. The glass for the car behind him was blackened. He couldn‚Äôt see a thing. He put the car into gear and launched a massive burnout. Smoke went everywhere.

¬†

He put the car into gear and sped off.

¬†

He left the Challenger in his wake. He screamed ‚ÄúBoo Yeah‚Äù in his exhilaration. He looked in his rear view mirror to back up what his ears were hearing and that was the engine sound of the Dodge Challenger.

¬†

It was gaining fast.

¬†

Sid put his foot down. The Mustang was going as fast at it could. Sid could see a narrow bridge coming up. The Challenger reared him and pushed.

¬†

The Mustang went over the side of the bridge. It fell down the cliff, rolling and crashing as the car caught fire and blew up at the bottom of the ridge.

¬†

The Challenger pulled up right on the edge. Dust and rocks falling over the edge. The engine revved, then reversed.

¬†

¬†

¬†

A bunch of students were sitting around the fire, sharing beans and eggs as the sun went down on the desert horizon.

¬†

A Mexican student got up and stood close to the fire.

1hzv35c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hzv35c/totally_friendzoned_or_am_i/,"Totally friendzoned, or am I?","Hello,

So I (F24) have this friend (M24) I would like to get some advice on...

Backstory:

We met around a year ago through a university project. Right off the bat we clicked super well, I had never felt so comfortable around a guy before, especially so fast. Didn't take long until we started spending long hours at school together almost on a daily basis. He would always initiate, drive me home, buy me coffee, always come to the gym when I said I would go, take me home again etc. Our connection grew quite deep - and then I found out he had a girl... of course. By that time I had managed to develop feelings, obviously, looking at the treatment he was giving me. Then my inner struggles began, doing everything in my power to overcome these immoral feelings I shouldn't have - multiple times I tried to cut contact but it always lead back to the same place, plus we had shared projects so it was almost impossible. From his side nothing changed either.¬†

Fast forward to this fall and I had managed to find peace in me, realizing I'm happy to have him as friend and all I want is for him to be happy, whomever with.

We still share a strong friendship and he is still acting the same way as before, even wanting to join the boxing club I'm going to... He also agreed to help me with bringing a new sofa to my place, which took 6hrs, a lot of driving, carrying and it was all at night lol.

I had a short period when I was dating this other guy, but (suprise suprise) it didn't work out as the emotional connection wasn't there.

This guy has never talked about his relationship with me, but a few days ago he learned I had broken things off with the guy I was dating. It was then when I learned he is really struggling in his relationship too. We haven't much hanged out outside of things related to school, but when I asked what's wrong he said it was so personal he would rather talk about it in real life so we are going to have a talk about it at a cafe now.

So probably you can sense the confusion I'm having here. He is a very outgoing person and I wonder if I'm overthinking the whole situation and if he is just being extremely friendly? Then again he is not having that kind of a friendship with anyone else that I know.

It has been a messed up situation for way too long now and it is making me feel terrible as a person, but I really cannot put into words the way we care about each other. And booy have I tried to get over this thing.¬†

I know it raises judgement, and I guess the convo we're going to have when he's back in town might give some clarity, but I'm interested to hear other people's thoughts on this.

Others around me are of course certain he has some kind of feelings, but could it be that it is truly just a strong friendship he sees in this? How should I approach the conversation we're going to have?

Thank you.

  
TL;DR: A guy who I met \~year ago, with whom I developed a strong friendship and deep connection with, is giving me princess treatment. Found out he had a gf but he kept acting the same. Tried to move on, no success. I recently broke things off with this other guy I was dating for 2 months and when he found out he told me his relationship (of 4 years) is messed up and now wants to meet and discuss his issues because its too personal for texting.",1,1736711186.0,relationships,1,0.6,False

1. Custom tags do not generate discoveries 

2. u/fredricology said ‚ÄúIf I tag my coffee as ""massage"" or ""meditation"" I get a Discovery that coffee lowers my respiration and increases my sleeping time. Although a stimulant like caffeine do the opposite. If I instead tag my coffees as ""caffeine"" I get a Discovery that it INCREASES my respiration rate and decreases my sleeping time. So tags seems to be pre-programmed and doesn¬¥t really look at our data right now. I hope it will in the future.‚Äù

What on earth is the point of tags if we‚Äôre all getting a generalized ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù of obvious observations.

I work in government, so life keeps me pretty busy, but I always try to make time for good friends and people.

Enjoy cars, photography, walks, coffee, and lately I've been enjoying reconnecting with my creative side so if any of that sounds good or you wanna chat shoot me a message, we might just get along great!


I'm hoping to connect with someone who's chill, down-to-earth, and open to friendship, whether it's hanging out, chatting online. Preferably Northside, but I'm open to other areas too.

Few days after that and we meet for coffee by her place and at the end of coffee I'd asked her to mini golf. A few weeks later, minigolf goes well too. All this while I'd only texted her to set up/confirm meetings since her responses would come several hours to a day later, I picked up that she wasn't going to be up for texting much.

I text her about our third outing right before Thanksgiving telling her that I'd wanted to go axe throwing and to a Christmas fest where we live. So mid December we ended up doing that too and outside the Christmas fest which was so crowded we had to leave i tell her that I really like her to which she responds she's ""not there yet"". I ask her if she's interested in hanging out again and she'd responded yes but didn't want to do dinner which I'd suggested first instead opting to do axe throwing again. She didn't seem perturbed by my expression of feelings here as we still joked and rode the subway together after.

So over Christmas I send her a personalized holiday message (non romantic but referencing her liking for office Xmas parties) to crickets and finally this past Tuesday I ask her about whether she'd wanted to do axe throwing again and It's been like 5 days and I haven't heard back.

What also might be related is my crushes roommate hasn't responded to Sean's text asking her to hang out this weekend either (they already hungout once for drinks over new years) and I don't know if what's going on with Sean and the roommate are connected with my issue. When Sean met with the roommate, me and my crush came up and they both agreed that they hope the two of us work out.

My question to y'all is do I have the option of a gentle check in message some days from now acknowledging that she's busy and can get back to me when she frees up or has she in your minds sufficiently signaled to me that she just doesn't want to hear from me again?",1,1736710551.0,dating,2,1.0,False

Hello there, 

Let me introduce myself: I'm a chilled-out EU-based introvert who thrives on bad movies, 90s TV nostalgia, and finding the perfect balance between laughs and awkwardness. If ""so bad it‚Äôs good"" is your mantra, welcome to my world. IMDb scores? The lower, the better! Cheesy creature features, 80s fantasy flicks, and all the glorious trash cinema have a special place in my heart.

When I‚Äôm not watching movies where the CGI looks like someone‚Äôs backyard project, I‚Äôm geeking out over:

* Vinyl records: because music just sounds better when it spins
* Coffee and snacks: caffeine-fueled chats + pretzels = pure bliss

I believe in the art of slow friendship building: sharing snippets of daily life, random memes, and maybe discuss a movie about how a fish puppet devours an entire rural town. It‚Äôs all about the journey, not the destination, right?

Bonus points if you also grew up with 90s classics like *The X-Files*, *Babylon 5*, Buffy and sitcoms like Frasier or Clarissa Explains it All.

1hzusnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1hzusnn/i_fear_ive_made_a_terrible_career_mistake_passing/,I fear I've made a terrible career mistake passing up a GIS Technician role,"I recently took an Environmental Planning job in Idaho which required me to relocate to the city of Moscow. Ironically, just after I moved, I was offered a position with the city in Arkansas that I'd just moved from as a GIS Technician with the possibility of promotion to Analyst after a year. Since I'd already moved, I ended up turning it down since it'd be too logistically difficult to relocate back so suddenly, and I was allured by the low cost of living in Idaho ($340 a month for rent with a $23/hr wage). I also figured I might as well try out the job and see how I like environmental planning and hazard mitigation. 

Now it's sunken in that ""trying it out"" means I'll be stuck in Idaho for the at least the next year, and the work has actually been quite dull so far. The city I'm in (Moscow) is quite desolate, and all the connections I spent a year forming in northwest Arkansas are now all for naught, and I know absolutely nobody here.

The document work bores me to tears, the office environment is quiet, staid, and church-like which drives me stir-crazy, and the GIS work is not really that rewarding - most of it seems to be clipping pre-made layers to the AOI and doing some basic geoprocessing, with very little of the ArcPy and Autodesk aspects that would've been involved with the city position. The cost of living is higher there, but at least you get something for it. The jobs would've paid about the same, but I could've kept my coffee shop job on the weekends which also provided a social outlet. 

I'm really kicking myself for not being more up front about my job offer in Idaho to the city in Arkansas when I was interviewing, and i'm starting to seriously doubt the supposed golden goose status of environmental planning jobs. If anything, GIS roles seem to have better pay and more interesting work. Oh well, I guess I've made my bed and now have to sleep in it, but I'm dreading spending another year in Idaho and can't believe I made this ill-conceived relocation so rashly.

At the drive-thru, I ordered my burrito and two black coffees ‚Äî one for me and one for him. I asked for a few pieces of ice in mine to cool it down, but kept the second one plain and hot, thinking it would help him warm up. When I pulled up to the window, the employee double-checked the order.

‚ÄúSo, two black coffees? One with ice?‚Äù
‚ÄúYessir.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo cream or sugar?‚Äù
‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

He handed me the first cup. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs got the ice.‚Äù

I took both coffees, thanked him, and drove around to park near the man‚Äôs corner. I hopped out, jogged over, and handed him the cup.

‚ÄúHey man, stay warm,‚Äù I said with a smile.
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he replied, taking the coffee.

The traffic light at the intersection turned green just as I jumped back in my car. I pulled into the lane, glancing back as I passed him. He raised the cup, took a sip ‚Äî and grimaced. His face twisted like he‚Äôd just swallowed a mouthful of vinegar.

I panicked. It‚Äôs too hot! I should‚Äôve cooled it down for him! I felt terrible, but I couldn‚Äôt stop in the middle of the road. All I could do was point at him, smile, and give a nod that I hoped looked sympathetic. Hang in there, buddy.

Three miles down the highway, I finally reached for my own coffee. Enough time had passed; it should be drinkable now. I grabbed the cup with the ice and took a sip.

Cold.
Freezing cold.
What the‚Ä¶

I shook the cup. The ice rattled loudly.
How is it so cold?
Wait. Was it ever hot? Was his coffee hot? 
Oh no‚Ä¶

It hit me like a snowball to the face. They never turned on the heater for either coffee. I had just handed that man a frigid, ice-cold Taco Bell coffee on a snowy morning and told him ‚Äî with a straight face ‚Äî to ‚Äústay warm.‚Äù

From his perspective, it must‚Äôve gone something like this:

A car pulls up, and a guy waves. A few minutes later, he swings back around, jumps out, and hustles over with a coffee in hand. He smiles, says, ‚ÄúStay warm!‚Äù and darts back to his car. I take a sip‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs ice cold. I point at the coffee, try to catch his attention, but he just smiles and points back at me like it‚Äôs some kind of joke.

‚ÄúStay warm?‚Äù Really? With an ice-cold coffee? In the snow?

What kind of jerk goes out of his way to do that?


---

TL;DR: I tried to do a nice thing for a homeless guy, but instead, I accidentally gave him an ice-cold coffee while cheerfully telling him to ‚Äústay warm.‚Äù

1hzur58,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hzur58/caffeine_is_amazing/,Caffeine is amazing!,"Seriously almost seems like a wonder drug. For the past week, I've started drinking coffee and energy drinks in the morning and everything is different. I haven't felt this way since I was in college. My mood has improved, I feel alert and present. I've had a string of health problems recently and even those seem to be improving. My anxiety has improved. I feel like working out again and going out. If you're feeling sluggish, definitely give morning caffeine a try.",5,1736710347.0,self,4,0.86,False

I like knowing that I have qualities that make me unique and sets me apart from others, that I'm not just a charity case or a placeholder for something better.

That said, I'm in my 30s and have never found a woman who will say yes to a date with me. Of the 100s of women I've talked to, I didn't even meet their minimum standard to go out for coffee, much less go on a full date.

Can I get rid of this scuff without sanding the whole table?

It‚Äôs clear I need a new finish which I know very little about. What finish could I use (based in UK) that would be appropriate for this wood?Should I be resanding the whole table or can I just apply it as is?

Myself and my roommate are trying to look for a third roommate as intentionally and thoughtfully as we can because we really love our place... so I apologize in advance for this post being fairly long... I'm trying not to end up in the ""bad roommates"" sub over here! I posted this room about a month ago and we decided to hold off for a little bit - so apologies if you reached out to me and I didn't get back to you, but if you are still interested please DM me again!

**About apartment:**¬†

We have a huge bedroom with a walk-in closet available in our beautiful, recently renovated apartment located halfway between the Kosciusko J and the Central Ave M in Bushwick. The apartment is a 3 bed 1 bath. The bedroom has a queen sized bed, a huge desk/office chair and two shelving units left behind by previous roommate who had to break lease early to move back to Los Angeles. This space was renovated just weeks before we moved in in summer 2024, so everything feels clean and new!¬† We have a¬†*huge*¬†fridge, large oven and microwave (no dishwasher). Our shower has unbeatable water pressure and a full bathtub. There are heat/AC units in every bedroom and the living room. There is tons of natural light in every room. It‚Äôs only a 3 unit building, which makes it feel safer and more predictable. There is no laundry in the building, but there are plenty of laundromats nearby. Bills are not included in the rent and typically amount to $70-140 each depending on time of year.

**What we‚Äôre looking for:**¬†

The room is available now and we are looking to fill it ASAP. We are really flexible on length - our lease renews on May 1st and ideally we‚Äôd love to find someone who might want to join the lease upon renewal. We are subletting until then to make sure we find the right fit, because we absolutely adore our cozy apartment and the good vibes we‚Äôve built here and we want to live with someone who is a good addition to that! We‚Äôre open to a 1-3 month sublet starting ASAP. We don‚Äôt have to be your best friends, but we‚Äôd love to live with someone chill who‚Äôs down to hang out now and again but also respects privacy/does their own thing. We do have a few non-negotiables‚Ä¶.¬†

* Must be clean!!¬†
   * We take turns once per week cleaning bathroom, kitchen and vacuuming
   * We clean as we go and try to keep our sink empty/clear, meaning we clean whatever dishes etc we use within an hour or two, or an absolute max of 24 hours if you‚Äôre rushing out the door or having a hectic day etc
   * We keep common spaces tidy and free of clutter¬†
   * We have a shoe-free apartment :)¬†

We love that our common space are low on clutter - meaning, we‚Äôd prefer to live with someone who isn‚Äôt bringing a ton of stuff (e.g kitchenware, furniture etc) with them. We have plenty of kitchenware etc that of course you are completely welcome to use! LGBTQIA+ friendly :)¬†

The only caveat about this apartment - it is an old building, and our ceiling isn't well insulated, meaning we can hear a lot more of our upstairs neighbours than we would like. We plan on talking to the landlord soon to see if they're open to putting down a carpet or some rugs. For us living here is still sooo worth it because we love the place, but the noise is definitely the one deterrent.

**About us:**¬†

We are two women in our mid-late 20s and one dog, also in her late 20s (in dog years!)

**Me, Charlotte:**¬†

* 27, work in tech so I work from home Monday to Friday. I‚Äôm from Ireland, but I‚Äôve lived in NYC for nearly 6 years! I love to take acting classes in the city; I just recently finished a one year conservatory evening program. I love to read, cook/bake, watch movies (we both have AMC A-List that we love to take advantage of!), crochet, play piano (I have a keyboard in my room, which of course I use headphones for lol) and hang out with my dog and with friends (in that order!)¬†

**Jenny:**

* Also 27! Jenny‚Äôs from Argentina and has lived here for almost 3 years. She works 3-4 days per week in the city and also loves to take acting classes :) she‚Äôs super chill, loves to go to the movies or have a movie/game night in. Neither of us are big partiers - we love to go out for a few drinks and sometimes have friends around for drinks/movies but keep it lowkey.

**Meadow the Doggo:**

* I have a 4 year old gorgeous rescue pit bull, Meadow. She‚Äôs an absolute angel - very chill to live with, mostly likes to snooze on my bed or nudge you for pets. She‚Äôs an anxious girl when she first meets people, but within a couple of mins she is your biggest fan. Our previous roommate had a dog too and they got along great, so we are open to living with another dog (as long as they don‚Äôt shed, don‚Äôt go on furniture and have a chill temperament).¬†

**The neighbourhood:**¬†

We live right on the border between Bushwick and Bed-Stuy. Having always lived in Bushwick myself, I‚Äôm more familiar with that side! There are tons of great coffee shops, bars, supermarkets etc and we are less than a 15 min walk from the lovely Maria Hernandez park.¬†

Please DM me if you are interested! Would love to hear about you, your interests etc and what you're looking for. We are open to men, women or NB folks - we just care about the vibes (for lack of a better word!) and cleanliness above all else :)

‚ÄúAlright, everyone, it‚Äôs time for ‚ÄòOn This Day 10 Years Ago,‚Äô‚Äù our editor announced, kicking off our Monday meeting.

This was our weekly ritual: revisiting notable events from a decade prior and assigning stories. A niche concept, but people loved digging up the past, especially the dark stuff. Think of us as a ‚ÄúWhatever Happened To‚Ä¶‚Äù for those obsessed with reliving human misery.

December 21 ‚Äì Winter Solstice ‚Äì gave us plenty of material: darkness, survival, winter madness (The Shining, anyone?), and other morbid tales. After a rundown, we claimed our pieces.

‚ÄúJimmy, you‚Äôre on the ‚ÄòJefferson Junior High Band Fire,‚Äô‚Äù Roger assigned.

I grimaced. ‚ÄúCan I hear the other options? Reporting on grieving families and band-aides isn‚Äôt my vibe today.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo late,‚Äù Roger shot back. ‚ÄúBesides, you‚Äôve got all year. Nothing says Christmas like Krampus.‚Äù

‚ÄúKrampus is overdone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the editor,‚Äù Roger said, dismissing the argument with a belly-cupping lean.

I spent the morning researching‚Äîrefreshing myself on the band story and tumbling into the eerie rabbit hole of Krampus folklore. Later, I packed up to attend my daughter Erica‚Äôs holiday band concert.

The event was classic: dressed-up kids, proud families, and squeaky renditions of festive songs. With winter break officially underway, I promised my wife, Rowan, and Erica I‚Äôd take a week off work. I mostly stuck to it, though reading up on Krampus didn‚Äôt feel entirely like cheating.

By January 1, I was ready to dive back in.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Jefferson Junior High Band Disaster occurred on December 21, 2014, in Cordova, Wisconsin, a town known for its location between the North Pole and equator, music festivals, and a devastating fire at the school. The fire during a band concert claimed 56 students, 110 family members, and 8 staff members, trapping them inside an auditorium where the doors locked automatically. Despite footage being removed from the school‚Äôs website, it still exists online.

The band's last song, ‚ÄúKrampus Comes to Christmas,‚Äù included eerie narration before things went horribly wrong. Survivors‚Äô accounts are unclear, but one person, Kel, the sound guy, filmed the disaster. His footage reportedly shows a giant flaming ball and Krampus appearing, followed by chaos and screams. Kel, now in a psychiatric hospital, accidentally knocked the camera, capturing only screams and a dark scene.

The official story was that faulty doors and an electrical fire caused the tragedy. Since then, the school‚Äôs band program has been canceled, and the auditorium remains untouched. I‚Äôm now heading to Cordova to investigate further, with a list of two people to speak to: Shelly O‚ÄôCavenaugh, the band director‚Äôs widow and Liesel Evans, the principal. There are a few more randoms I might be able to meet ‚Äì not too many, but a few people responded to the Facebook Post we put out looking for leads.

\*\*\*



The North Woods in the winter are bleak. It is dark for much of the day ‚Äì the sun usually doesn‚Äôt rise until 8:00, and it begins to set around 4:00. It‚Äôs also cold ‚Äì the cold that drives people in ‚Äì either to their homes or to bars. Snow blankets the ground and the buildings, and won‚Äôt melt until March. This insular quality can be charming if you‚Äôre up there for something like snowshoeing or cross country skiing. But, when you‚Äôre turning up stories about a mass child casualty, it can seal you like a tomb.

I got into town after the long drive, much of which was on two-lane country roads. I settled into my room in the town motel, and took the front desk clerk‚Äôs advice to have dinner at Otto‚Äôs ‚Äì the local bar and grill. The building creaked, as the wind battered the old windows; ice was building inside the rooms. I‚Äôll tell you, the entire time I was there, I don‚Äôt think I took off my coat. Obviously, I was an outsider.¬†

While this town had its share of visitors during the summer months and in the wake of the tragedy, my outsider vibe stood out like a banner. In a back booth, I sipped my Spotted Cow, and dug into my burger, while I read over some notes.¬†

‚ÄúYou busy?‚Äù a gruff voice asked from behind.

I looked up to see a middle aged man, full beard, a lot of camo, standing at my table with three other men, who could be related, or could have just adopted the same Wisconsin winter look.¬†

‚ÄúNo, not really,‚Äù I said quickly. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe heard you‚Äôre hear to talk about what happened at Jefferson. That Krampus stuff.‚Äù

He said it as a statement ‚Äì which was slightly accusatory.¬†

‚ÄúWell, yeah. I got assigned the story for my job. I wanted to see it, and talk to a few people.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs left, you know. That wiped out our kids ‚Äì most of our friends. Anyone who did live, we drove away. Don‚Äôt put your nose where it doesn‚Äôt belong, you read me? We let those others leave because they‚Äôre one of ours. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd treat you so kindly, if you catch my drift.‚Äù

With that, they strode away, and returned to their seats at the bar, turning back frequently, for effect ‚Äì or to see if what they said was enough to make me leave.¬†

It was. I quickly finished, left some money on the table, and returned to my room. When i got to my door, I saw a piece of paper folded into the door jamb. I took it, and quickly brought it inside, double latching the door behind me. Taking a breath, I opened it. It was a faded postcard. A grotesque creature with horns and chains loomed over a terrified child. ‚ÄúSeason‚Äôs Beatings!‚Äù it read. Beneath the cheap humor, the image stirred an unease I couldn‚Äôt shake. Probably those guys ‚Äì punctuating the message.

I learned that Shelly and Liesel no longer lived in Cordova, likely because they weren‚Äôt welcome after the fire. My plan to get reactions from the townsfolk was now off the table. Instead, I'd visit the site the next day for photos, then head north to find Shelly and Liesel.¬†

That night, I barely slept, worried the men from the bar might come after me. The wind howled against the window, and the sound of a loose shutter kept waking me, making me think they were at my door.¬† My mind also kept drifting to Krampus. The terrifying images of him‚Äîhalf-goat, half-demon, leading a procession with flaming torches, chains, bells, and a bundle of birch branches‚Äîhaunted me. The unsettling sound of his bells and the thought of the sack he used for capturing misbehaving children made the nightmares worse.

\*\*\*\*\*

Groggy, I woke up, thankful for surviving the night. It was early yet, no later than 6. I stopped at a gas station, got some coffee, and headed to the site of the junior high. The building stood ‚Äì the area where the auditorium had been was changed into a memorial. Though it was still dark out, the memorial was lit brightly. All the names of the children, towns members, and staff were listed ‚Äì except for Director Karl O‚ÄôCavenaugh. This was intentional, I found out. As I stood, taking pictures, I heard a light clicking behind me. I paused and listened, and heard the clicking magnified. Afraid I had been founded, I turned quickly.

Behind me, a herd of deer had gathered, their glassy eyes fixed on me. They stood motionless, save for the occasional flick of an ear. My breath caught‚Äîthe stillness wasn‚Äôt natural. Somewhere in the back of my mind, a snippet of folklore surfaced: animals sense what humans can‚Äôt. Suddenly, they all began to slowly shake their heads, left and right. Motionless, I watched. I heeded their warning, and moved towards my car, avoiding the herd. As I drove away, they continued to watch me, in disdain, as I headed into the darkness.¬†

On the way, I had to see more than 40 deer. Many were mangy, fur coming off in patches. I couldn‚Äôt drive more than 40 miles an hour, straining my eyes as I watched the sides of the road. Each one did the same thing ‚Äì shaking it‚Äôs head, as if telling me this was not a good idea. I was already 7 hours from home, and I was close, I could feel it. I‚Äôd talk to Shelly. Find a place to stay, head up to Liesel‚Äôs and see if I could at least get a ‚ÄúNo Comment‚Äù in person. And, then I‚Äôd drive the 9 hours home and be done with this.¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

Shelly had returned my emails. As the widow of the band director, she had lost her husband in the fire ‚Äì and should have been there. Her son was sick, so she stayed home with him, viewing the concert on TV. Shelly was well-liked ‚Äì she was a secretary at the elementary school, and had grown up in Cordova. Some expressed their sympathies ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt her fault. But most expressed a persistent, persuasive controlled isolation that gave her the message she was no longer welcome in town. Her parents had died in the fire ‚Äì they had gone to the Christmas Concert for as long as she could remember. With no one left but David, she moved an hour North, changed her last name, and took a job at the Walmart.

She had settled in Winterland, Wisconsin. The name was fitting as I worked my way through the narrow main road. Snow removal was a creative endeavor in small towns like this ‚Äì mounds of white were pushed in the center of the road, and filled large parking lots, creating mountains among the squat building. Shelly‚Äôs home was on a side street, and I parked somewhat in the middle of the road. I had not seen another car the whole way up from Cordova, and there were no cars out this morning, either. Shelly was waiting by the window, expectantly, as I walked up, and met me at the door.¬†

‚ÄúQuick, come in,‚Äù she said, pulling the door shut behind her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to let the cold air in,‚Äù she said nervously, taking my jacket.

The home was warm, and cozy. It smelled of soup and coffee. We sat in the front room, and Shelly wrapped in a crocheted blanket. She recounted, slowly, the evening. At first we focused on her ‚Äì i always find you get to the story once you get them talking about themselves. We talked about her guilt ‚Äì for not being there, and the way the townspeople treated her like she had a contagious disease, causing her and David to move up North. David, for his part, no longer a small child, but now an adult, passed in and out. He had on headphones ‚Äì the large kind, and didn‚Äôt acknowledge our presence.¬†

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs had a mental break. Noises bother him ‚Äì any noise. He wasn‚Äôt really like that before his dad died. I did keep the house very quiet after this happened. No music, no TV. I didn‚Äôt want to see the news, and any music reminded me of Karl. So, we lived in silence. I think it shocked Davey‚Äôs system ‚Äì he went from a house full of of instruments and singing and dancing ‚Äì to silence.‚Äù

Her recollection of the events were similar to what Kel‚Äôs video had shown. According to her, the lines read ‚Äì mixed in to be narrated over the band, which played discordant chords, were written to summon the beast himself. It had been a rumor, among the music community. Something like this had happened before at the first performance. Only, in that case, the group performing were in a sound studio. But, that space had also caught on fire, and the doors to the studio showed marks from where the musicians had tried to claw their way out before they burned alive, being found in pugilistic posture with a clenched position due to the contraction of muscles in the heat. Karl had heard this ‚Äì but, when he found the piece, he was convinced it wasn‚Äôt true. And, he reasoned, if it was, Liesel would have told him no.

In all my research, I had not heard of this case. I questioned her on this.

‚ÄúThey changed the name. It had gotten a little press in Nashville, I think. But, they just changed the name ‚Äì not the words, not the song.‚Äù

She looked down, and I saw a teardrop on her folded hands.

‚ÄúWe ruined a town. We killed them. And, now I‚Äôve ruined my son. We ruined Christmas.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no. These things happen. Really ‚Äì look, I write about stuff like this all the time. There‚Äôs always a logical explanation ‚Äì which doesn‚Äôt make it better. But, it‚Äôs not his fault.‚Äù

She looked up, her face suddenly changed. Her looked angry, her mouth drawn.

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs Ms. Evans. If she hadn‚Äôt approved this song ‚Äì had just said something, it never would have been chosen. She had the authority. It was her job. And, she told him to play it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what you‚Äôre saying is, Karl had to have his music approved? And, Liesel, gave him the greenlight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes ‚Äì it was her. She was the evil one. She‚Äôs the one who told him to try something new. She‚Äôs the one who gave him the idea to check out the warehouse. Do you know this music was over 75 years old? It had been stored for a reason. But, since she got out ‚Äì she goes on. And, no one cares.‚Äù

This was interesting. I hadn‚Äôt heard anything about Liesel, other than the fact that she had escaped. It made more sense about how she had reacted to my requests. There wasn‚Äôt much more to talk about, and I timed it out so I could make the couple hour drive during daylight to Lake Superior. I thanked her.¬†

As I made my way to the door, she handed me an envelope.¬†

‚ÄúJust open this when you get where you‚Äôre going.‚Äù I nodded.

Getting back into my car, I turned on the defrost. The heat I generated on the way up had left a sheen of ice on the interior of my car. Opening the envelope ‚Äì she couldn‚Äôt see me anyway in this ice box, I found the narrator‚Äôs lines for the Krampus song. According to her account ‚Äì as soon as the final line was read, the fire began. How these words ever made it into a middle school band concert are beyond me:

In the cold of winter's grip,

A shadow stirs with frosty lip,

Hooves that echo, chains that clink,

Krampus comes with eyes that blink.

Fur like night and horns like stone,

He moves through towns where lights have grown,

A whistle sharp, a chilling sound,

A monstrous figure, creeping 'round.

With a sack to carry children‚Äôs cries,

He steals away beneath dark skies.

The bell‚Äôs harsh jingle rings the doom,

As flames rise high in endless gloom.

He knows the weak, 

he knows the sin,

And haunts the hearts that dwell within.

A cruel laugh splits the silent air,

For Krampus seeks those who despair.

Beware the night, the cold and fear,

When Krampus‚Äô steps draw ever near. 

No prayer will save, no door will lock,

His cold embrace the final shock.

In neat script, Shelly (I assume) had written:

*These are the words that were read;¬† I don‚Äôt believe any copies remain. You need to see the words, you need to understand that this is what brought Krampus. If they‚Äôre uttered aloud, he comes. Please do not print, and please destroy.*¬†

So, these words were read ‚Äì and the town ended up dead. It was chilling. I imagined the kids ‚Äì screaming, as the fire spread. The parents, trying to find their children, and having these words be the last thing they heard ‚Äì aside from the anguished screams engulfed in smoke and flames. I looked up ‚Äì and my windshield was clear. I put my car in reverse, and stopped immediately ‚Äì flagged by the back up detector.¬†

Looking through my rearview mirror ‚Äì I caught the reflection of a buck. Its horns stretched outward, it had to be a 14-point buck. He stood there, steam emanating from his nostrils. Like all the deer before him, he slowly shook his head. Again. I kind of waved my acknowledgement, and went as quickly as I could to the main road to take me out of Winterland, and on to Baycliff.

\*\*\*\*\*

Liesel had been a little less forthcoming in our discussions. Liesel was also at the concert ‚Äì she had left before the final song, checking her cell phone. She too had a sick one at home ‚Äì her other two boys, though, were in band. The babysitter had called, asking if Nate could have some ice cream ‚Äì he had made a miraculous recovery ‚Äì and while explaining no in five different ways, she heard the doors click behind her, and then the screams. When interviewed about it, she had tired to get it ‚Äì reports indicate she actually scratched into the heavy wood doors with her nails in an attempt to pry them open.. Liesel had left town not long after the fire; she resigned, and headed even farther north, to Lake Superior, with Nate. They too took new names. She was not willing to do an interview ‚Äì but, I can be pretty convincing. And, the benefit of sparsely populated places ‚Äì you can find people pretty easily.

Baycliff was almost in Michigan. On the most northern point of the state, it was even colder, and even more bleak. There was no motel in Baycliff ‚Äì in fact, it was not even a true town, and from what I had gathered, Liesel didn‚Äôt live in town. I made my way into Ashland, found a room, and quickly got fast food. I didn‚Äôt want to run into locals. I didn‚Äôt want to see more deer. The same thing that had happened on the way to Winterland happened on the way here. Deer ‚Äì everywhere. In various forms of decay, lined the road. Each of them stared at my approach and passing, their black eyes fixed, their heads shaking slowly.

The night proved uneventful ‚Äì aside from the banging of the wind, and the dreams of Krampus. I awoke, and lay in bed, lulled by the sound of the radiator blasting heat. Getting up to make coffee, I pulled aside the heavy curtain to see if it was yet light. I took a step back when I saw a shadowy, horned figure etched into the frost on the window, resembling Krampus. It wasn‚Äôt a simple condensation pattern or a natural frost formation; it was deliberate, almost as though someone‚Äîor something‚Äîhad crafted it overnight. The room felt small, as this image only reiterated what I was feeling ‚Äì I had been marked. This eerie omen was left, as if the creature had marked me for some unknown purpose. I felt as if I was being watched, trapped in a cycle I couldn‚Äôt escape. I went outside, felt the blast of the below zero temperatures, and tried to scape off the ice from the window. Then, I quickly packed up my room, got dressed, and headed to a local diner for breakfast.

I scanned the room again, my eyes darting to the door every few minutes, and then focused on my coffee. When the waitress came back to refill my cup, I decided she seemed harmless enough.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I began, keeping my tone casual. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt happen to know a woman around here with a son‚Äîhe‚Äôd be about 18 now. Moved up this way maybe ten years ago?‚Äù

She tilted her head, giving me a curious look. ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ you mean Lila? Why? What‚Äôs going on? She in some kind of trouble?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no, nothing like that,‚Äù I said quickly, forcing a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just an old friend. We were supposed to catch up while I was passing through, but I misplaced her address. And her number, too, somehow.‚Äù I added a sheepish shrug for good measure.

The waitress seemed to relax, her suspicion melting into mild interest. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs who I‚Äôm thinking of, she‚Äôs out by Beaver Creek. Not much out there but trees and a couple of houses. She‚Äôs kind of‚Ä¶ different, you know? Keeps to herself. Her son‚Äôs a hell of an athlete, though. I think he‚Äôs headed to college in Florida next year. I saw something about it in the paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gotta be her,‚Äù I said, nodding as if I were relieved. ‚ÄúWeird Lila. Yeah, that‚Äôs what we used to call her,‚Äù I added with a chuckle, trying to sell the lie.

The waitress didn‚Äôt seem to notice anything off and went back to tidying up behind the counter, clearly satisfied with the exchange. Just another stranger in a town happy to gossip about someone on the fringe.

When my food came, I thanked her, ate about half of it, and left some cash on the table. My stomach churned as I walked to the car, though I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was from the food or something else entirely.

I pulled up Beaver Creek on my GPS and started east, trying to shake the uneasy feeling that settled over me. I didn‚Äôt like this place, didn‚Äôt like how it made my skin crawl, but I had to find Lila‚Äîor at least say I tried. Then, maybe, I could leave this town behind for good and get back to Illinois.

The drive, as all had been, was desolate. The landscape was white ‚Äì the ground, the road, the trees ‚Äì the sky had even taken on the quality of blankness. The only contrast were the dark shape of deer, spotted every so often along the road. Only, now they appeared more sinister. I know they were deer. But they looked different ‚Äì larger, with larger horns. Their faces took on the look of something sinister. Their eyes blacker. I avoided their gaze and kept my head straight until I hit a road that ran along the river.¬†

The water churned, dark and brown. The road had one single set of tire marks in it, and I followed those, hoping this was the clue I needed. It was. About a quarter mile up, I saw a Baycliff High School Banner, with the last name Nilsen, and the first name Nathan. I would bet this one was them. And, the tracks I had been following went right to this home. Smoke billowed from the chimney of a small, river stone home. I parked in the drive, and opened my door. The blast of the cold stopped me momentarily.¬†

As I walked to the front door, I saw movement in the window, just the flutter of a curtain. Before I reached the front door, it opened quickly.¬†

‚ÄúWell, you are certainly persistent,‚Äù said a small woman, with gray hair and large classes.¬†

Thought I was at least a foot taller than her, she was intimidating, even in a purple sweatsuit. This was her ‚Äì I could tell she was a principal by her stance and the way she seemed to look right into my conscious.

‚ÄúLiesel?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúYes, unfortunately. You might as well come in ‚Äì no sense standing in the cold, and letting all my heat out. Take off your boots.‚Äù

I did as I was told, and entered the home.¬†

I would love to tell you I got to the bottom of this. And, that there was a rational explanation for everything. That wasn‚Äôt the case. As we sat down, we began to talk about her time in Cordova over coffee. Nate wasn‚Äôt home; he was working in Ashland at the Home Depot. He was going to Florida on an athletic scholarship, and Liesel planned on following down there. Winter wasn‚Äôt the same, Christmas had been ruined. It was pretty much the same feeling Shelly had shared. Liesel lost her two sons that day, and she and Nathan had decided to not celebrate the holiday anymore. Liesel‚Äôs husband had left her, taking hsi own life a few years after, addled by alcohol and grief.¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much left to tell. It was awful. It was the worst day of my life. There have been days I wish we were all in there together, and there were days I wished I never made the older two play an instrument. But, you can‚Äôt ask questions. You‚Äôll find answers you didn‚Äôt need to know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do have one more question, if you don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù I said, pulling the envelope out of my coat pocket. ‚ÄúI saw Shelly. She gave me something. A poem, it looks like‚Ä¶‚Äù

Liesel shot up immediately, and in one swift movement, grabbed me by the arm, pulling me out of the seat.

‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù she said, picking up my boots. She opened the door and threw them outside.¬†

‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù she said again ‚Äì louder this time. She looked into the treeline, back and forth, her eyes filled in terror. ‚ÄúWhy would you bring that! That lady wanted you to summon them. She has never accepted she wasn‚Äôt the only one who lost anything. We all lost. A part of all of us died that day. But this ‚Äì she won‚Äôt let it stop. If you‚Äôve read it ‚Äì even to yourself, you‚Äôve summoned it. Get out, and don‚Äôt come back. Don‚Äôt even take that out again.‚Äù

With that, I stood there, shocked. I too looked around, as the door bolts click, click, clicked.¬†

What had I done? What did Shelly do to me?

\*\*\*\*\*

I drove back to Illinois as quickly as I could. The trip was a blur. I kept my eyes on the road, and didn‚Äôt reach home until midnight. Somewhere, on a lone stretch of highway, I had taken the envelope and threw it out the window. The words, harmless, probably, made me paranoid. Having them on me, or even near me, was too much. My only hope was they‚Äôd be picked up by a snowplow, and gone forever.

Back in town, I was anxious to get this written and out of my hands. At this point, I was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt be on staff by the time this was published. None of this felt right, and I didn‚Äôt want to be associated with the story I was about to write. Once done, I‚Äôd put out my feelers and find a position writing about prep sports or something.

Roger loved the story ‚Äì of course, sick bastard. It had just enough mystery. I didn‚Äôt include anything about the poem, and I embellished a bit. The final printed article suggested that Liesel admitted the doors were done in a shoddy way; it was the doors. The fire had been due to a malfunctioning sound system they were aiming to replace.¬†

Krampus did not cause this. Krampus‚Äôs words were not to blame. Now, if only I could convince myself of this, I would be fine. It wasn‚Äôt that easy though. Each month, something would happen, taking me back to those three days up North. Deer, stopping and judging. Krampus images showing up out of season. Banners across internet pages, where his sinister smile would seemingly eat me alive.

August 2025

I did end up finding that other job. Jimmy Jansen was now the beat reporter for local sports in the Glendale area ‚Äì and, I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Very little drama ‚Äì aside from the sidelined hero dealing with a torn ACL. I could handle that. The hours were better too, and there was no travel ‚Äì which meant no deer.

I finished early, one afternoon, and let Rowen know I would pick up Erica. She had started a new year, and I was eager to get a little more one on one time with her. I watched her come out and make her way to my car after leaving her friends.¬†

‚ÄúHow was the day,‚Äù I asked, easing out of the pickup line, glancing at her, smiling.

‚ÄúReally, really good. Guess what?‚Äù I loved when Erica was this animated. I was so fortunate to have some an amazing kid ‚Äì it got me thinking about Cordova, and all those families. All that tragedy. I thought of Shelly, alone with Davey in Winterland ‚Äì a perpetual winter for them. I wondered what Liesel was doing, and if Nate made it to Florida. I was lucky.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, keeping my eyes on the road.

She continued,¬† ‚ÄúWe already picked Christmas music for the concert ‚Äì and, we‚Äôre doing this really, really weird piece. Mr. Brown said it‚Äôs not even published anymore ‚Äì something about some tragedy. Anyway, he found an old copy in the music room. It‚Äôs about this guy ‚Äì his name is Krampus. Have you heard of him? Anyway, he‚Äôs super weird and is the opposite of Santa ‚Äì so he like, beats you if you‚Äôre bad. Anyway, it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúKrampus Comes to Christmas‚Äù and I get to be the reader ‚Äì I read all this really dark stuff about him coming for all of us. Isn‚Äôt that cool?

Warning: This is a really really long story. Thank you to anyone who reads it. 

These situations happened over a year ago - I was the one cutting contact with one friend at about 4 years ago, and in the past two years, two very closed friends cut contact with me one after the other, out of the blue. It still bothers me to this day because I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôve done to lead to this outcome. Maybe sharing the story will help me have a different perspective and finally be able to move on. 

So, as the title says, my closest friends have suddenly cut contact with me, and I cut contact with one of them. For a bit of context, I‚Äôve always been a really introvert and shy person, with not so many friends. The ones I did have, were really really close and I trusted them like if they were family.

This story if about Mary, Sarah and John (fake names). 

I met Mary and Sarah in elementary school, and we rapidly became friends and would hang out almost everyday after school. Sarah had a tough background and didn‚Äôt have a lot of possibilities money wise, so she would spend a lot of time in my place, sleeping, eating and just receiving the warmth of a somewhat stable family. Mary, on the other hand, was a really privileged kid, an only child who was used to have everything she wanted. But she had a good heart, and for all the years of elementary school, she was bullied by other girls for no apparent reason. 

As we got into high school, we went separate ways. I went to a new school in another district and they went to different areas, had different classes, made new friends. Sarah got her first serious boyfriend, so she would spend a lot of time with him. Mary started to change due to her new ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, and almost as an act of rebellion for all the bullying she had suffered- she started sexualizing herself, dressing up in questionable ways, partying a lot, got to experiment her first heavy dr*gs, and got a boyfriend who would ab*se her, physically and emotionally, but would stay with him because of the ‚Äústatus‚Äù he had (he was a popular rich kid, somewhat famous in our country). 

During this whole process, I have always been there for Mary. Her situation at home got worse. As her parents realized she was not a sweet hearted kid anymore, they pretty much cut any emotional bond they had with her, providing only with money for any emotional gap there could exist. I listened to her cry, and comforted her, I tried to help in as many ways as a 16 year old person could. She had a really low self esteem, although she tried to portray exactly the opposite. I was the only one who really knew her scares and vulnerabilities. But with everything happening in her life, she rapidly became unstable and angry. She would twist reality to her benefit and developed really toxic habits. She was obsessed over boys who didn‚Äôt want anything to do with her, would harass them online and their new girlfriends, and would not quit until they would react to her words. She would then proceed to go on a rant with me saying how bad these people were to her. As I got older and wiser, I wouldn‚Äôt take her side so much and would instead try to call her out on her toxic behavior, but always trying to be respectful of her emotions and the way I would address the situations. This led to her starting to see me as her enemy. Someone who would not take her side. She would talk wrongly about me on social media, calling me ugly, a gnome, all sorts of insults. And I had no idea this was happening, because I didn‚Äôt have that many social media platforms. She would be with me and call me her best friend while doing this on my back. 

When we got to college, I got my first boyfriend who, despite all his flaws, was a really social person and the life of the party. He had a big group of friends where Mary and Sarah were immediately included. We would all hang out a lot. His friends would always compliment how hot Mary was (she was the most ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù one from the three of us) and I think this made her create some superiority complex towards me and Sarah. Regardless, I got really focused on university, and wouldn‚Äôt spend as much time going out. Sarah and Mary rapidly became a duo and I was cut off from a lot of things - coffee hangouts, shopping hangouts, etc. Specially because, at this time, my family was struggling with money and I didn‚Äôt have the freedom to just eat out and go shopping every week like they did. Even though I tried to explain this to them, they didn‚Äôt want to forfeit these activities. So I would also choose not to join them. When I did join them, they would just gossip about people I didn‚Äôt know and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt be part of the conversation. Maybe it was my fault for not trying enough at the time, but who knows. 

On my 19th birthday, Mary surprised me with a trip to London. As kids, we were obsessed with One Direction and always wanted to visit the city. She made it happen with plane tickets and my bf‚Äôs sister, who lived in the UK at the time, let us stay over the weekend. It was an awesome gift and, to this day, I am still really grateful she managed to make this happen. But while she was making this grand gesture, she repeatedly kept speaking wrongly about me online. And I was still oblivious. 

Fast forward to 2020, when covid was happening. We were all supposed to stay at home and not meet with other people. Me and my bf at the time had broken up, but he became really close friends with Mary. She would always call me to speak about him, which made me really uncomfortable, so I created some distance from her. When the time to celebrate her birthday arrived, she wanted to do a huge house party, and I politely declined her invitation because both my parents have chronic diseases and, still living with them, I didn‚Äôt want to get covid and spread it to them. She got really pissed off and refused to understand my side. I made sure to still buy her birthday gift, went over to her door and delivered it, made sure to have some time with her on her day. But she was still made I chose not to make an appearance at the party and said my reasons were not valid. 

I was really hurt and from there our relationship went down hill. We would argue a lot. Until I discovered from a common friend all the bullsh** she was writing about me online. Her latest post was about the fact that she had offered me a trip to the UK and I still had the audacity to skip her birthday. She called me the b word and said how terrible I was. From then on, and after reading the other posts, my trust in her was broken and I simply stopped replying to her texts. She never reached out again and neither did I. We stopped following each other on social media, but she is still obsessed with seeing my profiles, for some reason. Later this year, I knew from Sarah that she was diagnosed with BPD, she was more self aware, but never forgave me and still considered me to be an awful, disrespectful and ungrateful piece of sh*t. I recognize I was on the wrong for not giving her an explanation, but after seeing what I saw, I didn‚Äôt feel the want or need to do it‚Ä¶ I just wish I knew what led her to paint such a negative picture of me. I could blame her mental health and her past trauma, but honestly I became tired of always finding apologies for her. 

Regarding Sarah, she also discovered Mary was writing bad stuff about her. They stopped talking. But while they were a duo, it was apparently common for them to ‚Äúgossip‚Äù about me. So when my relationship went south with Mary, it also went south with Sarah. But Sarah gave me time and really tried to show me she had changed. We became really close friends again, and we somewhat trauma bonded over recent life events. At the time, I was with a new partner, and we would always include Sarah in our own activities as a couple. But soon realized she required a lot of attention. For instance, we would be in the car and I would ask my partner a more private question (like ‚Äúhow is your mom doing‚Äù) and she would shout from the back seat ‚Äúcan you please talk louder? I‚Äôm tired of being your third wheel!!‚Äù. Or when we would randomly kiss or hug when the 3 of us were hanging out, I would hear ‚Äúguys I‚Äôm here if you didn‚Äôt forget‚Äù. She would be petty and things would always have to go her way, otherwise she would sulk and pout. One time, we had a really bad fight, I honestly don‚Äôt remember about what exactly, but she would repeatedly cross my boundaries even when I asked her time to process my emotions. Eventually things cooled off and we were okay again. But this became a pattern: if I didn‚Äôt attend to her needs or wants, she would put me on the wrong, give me a speech about how hurt she felt, and I would always say yes, you‚Äôre right, and apologize. I believe she was somewhat emotionally dependent on me, since she required a lot of attention. But it was overwhelming and I soon became avoidant, which only made the pattern even worse and I do recognize my share of guilt in the bigger picture.

My relationship with that partner at the time ended, and she was friends with both of us still. Something I always do when I finish relationships, is go no contact with the person. It‚Äôs the only mechanism I found that helps me get over it. But I knew she was still in contact with them, so I kept my distance, afraid she would do the same Mary had once done. Our friendship had its on and off moments. Even with our larger group. She would get mad at everyone and, on the next day, everything was suddenly okay. She would comment how she felt everyone liked me better than her, how I was the favorite one and she didn‚Äôt have the space to be the center of attention once in a while. I remember one time that this happened during her birthday. I suddenly started to have an anxiety attack because it marked one year since the death of my grandfather, to whom I was really closed to. I tried to bottle up my emotions but I was really emotional at the time. I remember exiting the table to calm down a bit and not make a big scene during her day. She twisted the story and said all I wanted was attention. So, this was a recurring subject throughout.

Our friendship grew worse and worse. I had to be there when she wanted me to be there, to listen and comfort her, but I would also need to be away when she wanted distance from me. She repeated the same with other friends - she would create an argument with someone, and then turn to next person available. When she would calm down, she would return to the person with whom she had argued initially and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay now‚Äù and everything would go back to normal. I think we all came to accept this because she was in a really bad spot at the time, dealing with depression, and we all wanted to be there for her. I remember a time she got into an argument with John, cut him off completely. Then the next day, she couldn‚Äôt turn her car on, and proceeded to call two friends who didn‚Äôt pick up. She then called John, without ever touching the subject, asking for his help. Later that day they appear at my house like the biggest argument just didn‚Äôt happen at all. She also tried to turn people to her side and sort of demonize me. Luckily my friends would always listen to both sides of the story and remain imparcial, which really pissed her off and led her to make accusations like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always picking her side and not mine!‚Äù. 

I created the same pattern with her, avoiding and being close when needed, although I would always avoid opening up to her about my struggles. I didn‚Äôt feel like I could trust her, after all the history we had. She accused me of putting her in the middle of arguments with my ex partner, and stuff of the sort. Until she got a new bf, and she started to become emotionally dependent on him, which kinda gave me some ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù, an emotion I describe because I was really feeling trapped in her friendship and seemed like everything I did was never good enough for her. But this pattern continued‚Ä¶ until one day we had a really big argument, again. One involving her and John. 

We got to meet with them and another friend of mine and just chill out for an afternoon. I tried to give my friend a bit more attention than to Sarah and John since she is really shy and has a hard time fitting in. Sarah didn‚Äôt like this and started to sulk, like always, walking in front of us and giving me and my friend the silent treatment. We head over to the car, so that we could drop off my friend. When we head back, (it was a 40 minute trip), I start to casually say how I would like my next partner to share similar interests to mine, since in my past relationships I didn‚Äôt have that and felt like that was something I lacked. Sarah just bluntly goes ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so childish ugh! Why do you care so much about common interests? Me and (her bf at the time) don‚Äôt have nothing in common and we make it work!‚Äù And I tried to explain that, even though I was happy for them, that was not my reality. John joins the convo and started agreeing with her, which only gave them some strength to repeatedly call me ‚Äúchildish‚Äù. For someone who‚Äôs usually really calm, I couldn‚Äôt take it no more and passionately asked them to leave me alone. This led them to not speak for the entirety of the car trip. When I asked them what was wrong, both accused of ‚Äútelling them to shut up‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

 Sarah would trauma guilt me into accepting only her truth and denying mine, while repeatedly asking me to apologize, which I did. I rarely showed her my side of the story, and she was used to manipulate me really well into her emotional traps. One thing our group really used against each others was ‚Äúthese are my emotions and they are valid, so you just need to accept them and undermine yours‚Äù. 
One day, we agreed to talk it through, after that fight in the car. She proceeded to throw everything she had against me to my face. I was just quiet. Until I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and I yelled, I finally felt like I deserved a voice in all of this. She was shocked and said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe my own friend is screaming at me! You are really childish‚Äù. We both calmed down, I asked her for some time, two to three days because I was in a vulnerable place, still mourning my last relationship, and after those two days I reached out. She just simply stopped answering my messages and we‚Äôre still in no contact to this day, after almost two years. 
I wish I could have handled the situation better, but I really felt like I had no voice. 

Regarding John, the story goes back to my first relationship ever. We met through mutual friends and John was really sweet, and treated me way better than my bf at the time did. He made me question that, if a friend treated me like that, why was I accepting such a toxic behavior from my own bf. John soon confessed to have feelings for me, on the same week I broke up with my bf. I was feeling lonely and he was close, so for a week I tried having something with him. I soon realized the reasons why I was doing it were wrong and I didn‚Äôt want him to just be the backup plan, since I didn‚Äôt even had romantic feelings towards him. But this kept going for the entirety of our friendship. Every time I would enter a new relationship, he would become somewhat distant. Every time I broke up, he would try his luck again. But apart from this, we were great friends and got along really well. He was there when I needed him, and I was there when he needed me. I considered him to be one of my closest friends and always tried to put behind me the fact that he had feelings for me. I just wanted a friend, and never crossed any line that could give him hope of ever being with me. However, he never seemed to drop the idea: no girl was ever good enough for him, and I even remember one time he told me he was so happy because he matched with a girl who was really similar to me, personality and looks wise. I found it weird but brushed it off. 

We had our ups and downs, like all friendships. One time I even asked for some distance because I found he would initiate conversations to speak wrongly about me when I was absent. I eventually forgave him and he apologized and changed his behavior. When my last relationship ended, I leaned on him a lot. My ex partner suffered a lot with mental health and dragged me along with them. There wouldn‚Äôt be a day where I wouldn‚Äôt have a panic attack due to their behavior. John really did help me and was there when I needed someone to listen. When I started to recover from the heartbreak, I tried dating apps for the first time and had my fair share of bad dates and experiences. John would always be there to pick up the pieces, but I felt bad for it. I knew his true intentions, and I didn‚Äôt want to rely on him so much. I blame myself for that. From one day to the next, he stopped replying to my texts. I wrote him about a week later saying I was sorry if I did anything that hurt him and I missed my friend. He replied he needed space from me and after two years, I‚Äôve never heard a word back from him. I found out later last year, also through a friend in common, that he told a girl he was going out with (a friend of that friend in common) that he used to have a really needy friend, who would only talk to him because of the attention he gave me: you guessed it, it was me. 

It‚Äôs been two years now, for Sarah and John. I still look back to the days we would hang out together, have fun, go out. We were really close. It bothers me that, from night to day, things went south. I‚Äôve tried multiple times to understand what did I do wrong, how can I make up for it; other times, I just feel like sending a really spiteful message for the pain they caused: they made me feel abandoned, used, unseen. Perhaps I did the same, but I would like them to tell me that. I would like to change, be a better friend for those I love. But this situation only made me afraid of losing more people around me‚Ä¶ AITA? ",2,1736709528.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1hzueri,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hzueri/upgrade_from_bbe_5002000usd/,Upgrade from BBE (500-2000USD),"I have a had a BBE for the last 5 years. Looking to upgrade. Recently bought a DF54, and was planning on building a Gagguino or Gaggia PID from a Gaggia E24. But then looked towards the Profitec GO, to save me from the work of modifying. Then I fell down the rabbit hole‚Ä¶

After hours if youtube and reddit searches, I‚Äôm at a loss, and in need of advice. I usually make 1-2 cups at the same time, but would like to be able to make 4-6 cups when needed. Additionally having the option to draw hot water for tea is a big plus.  

Drinks I make is various milk drinks and americanos. I want to make espressos as well, but have not been able to get a good tasting espresso consistently. 

A Profitec Move looks in many ways perfect, but I am not sure if the limited capacity in the boilers will limit the number of cups I can make back to back, especially if I make americanos. 

For 4-500 usd less I can get a Crem One dual boiler with double PID and vibration pump, but I cant find any reviews about this machine, other than WLL instruction video. This has huge boilers and option for plumbing. 

I love the look of plack E61 machines like the mara x/bianca and rocket appartamento tca. 

I like the idea of the manual barista-feeling of a E61, and I dont need very fast heat up times.

I like the small form factor of the Gaggia/Profitec Go, and as I see it, these will only limit the number of milk drinks back to back if paired with a kettle (for tea and americanos). 

Fair to say, I‚Äôm open to suggestions. DF54 grinder paired with a machine that can take my next 5-10 years of coffee furter than the BBE.

1hzudr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hzudr0/considering_giving_up/,Considering Giving Up,"
So my girlfriend and I decided to get ourselves an espresso setup for Christmas, and after quite a bit of research we decided on the Turin DF64 gen 2 grinder and the Breville Bambino Plus espresso machine (basic I know). After spending some time with the setup I feel as though I've learned a lot, but am also very frustrated and am considering returning them for something else. Without any rhyme or reason, here are some of my thoughts:

When the grinder arrived, I saw several videos showing how to mark the burrs with dry erase markers to test the alignment of the grinder. In almost all of those videos they showed that it was between 90% and 100% alignment so they didn't get to what you should do if they aren't well aligned. When I did my own test it was at best 60% or so aligned, but I wasn't sure how to improve it or if it would even be worth it so I just dealt with it. 

This may be my own fault for overlooking it, but I saw a lot of videos and posts recommending these two machines in tandem, but I didn't realize the DF64 works with a 58mm portafilter while the Bambino uses 54mm, so they aren't directly compatible making the process a bit clunky. I've seen some modifications you can make to fix this, but feels like for the price of the machines you shouldn't have to be making modifications.

The Bambino Plus comes with an automatic steam wand where you set the size and temp and it steams it for you. I tried this at the highest temp setting, and half the time it ends up boiling over and getting everywhere. I suppose it's an easy fix to use a lower temp setting, but it feels like all setting combinations should at least work.

Also partially my fault for not getting a scale yet, but I saw on several videos that you want the espresso to start flowing at around 10s or so, and then continue for 20-30s for a good shot. They also note that you want something between a fast stream and dripping. With the automatic setting on the Bambino, I found that once I got the grind right for what seemed like a good starting time and a good looking stream it would be cut short so the shot was very small. If I coarsened the grind to increase the flow the shot would be larger, but a lot less flavorful. I tried out the manual mode with a 7s pre-infusion time and then let it run until I had a properly sized shot that actually tasted really good. Glad I was able to arrive at a good shot, but what's the point of having an automatic machine if it barely works for you.

I got a new bag of beans that I tried at a shop and really enjoyed. I expected to go through the process of dialing in the grinder for this new bean, and did have to go quite a bit coarser than the previous bean, but eventually did start pulling pretty good shots. Unfortunately, as soon as I thought I had it dialed in the espresso machine started leaking in between the portafilter and group head. I tried cleaning it really well and packing less espresso in, but no matter what I do now it leaks. At this point I am planning to contact Breville for a replacement, but am so frustrated with how much effort I've had to put in for little to no benefit after paying over $800 and still needing to spend a few $100 more on accessories that I'm thinking I may just return them and use the money for a nice camera or something else.

To summarize, after spending as much as I did on these machines I was expecting to be able to make a shot of espresso that exceeded the quality you could get at a local coffee shop after some learning pains, but at this point it feels like the quality of the product simply are not worth the amount of time, money and effort you need to put in. I know I'm just complaining here and maybe I'm just an idiot and am doing it wrong, so if that's the case I'd love to hear what you have to say about it, but if it just is what it is maybe this isn't for me and I'd rather get into photography.

We previously dated in high school and went to the same college, but I had to drop out after 1 semester to move to FL with my family. We were together then for 2.5 years. 

He helped me move to FL, but when we realized we had no long term strategy of figuring things out long distance, we broke up. We were no contact for 8 years. 

Things got really bad for me in FL. Due to my father passing away, my mom financially abusing me, and becoming the victim of domestic abuse, I was left with nowhere to go. He had donated to my dad's gofundme and he had been on my mind. I reached out to him, and surprisingly, he came and got me after 2 weeks of talking again. He rescued me and my two dogs. He said he never stopped loving me, had even written songs about me. 

He's truly an amazing man. He loves his family and takes such good care of our animals. He's insanely bonded to my dogs and they've both fallen in love with him. He helps me with anything I need help with. He makes me coffee twice a day. I've been dealing with chronic health issues and been in extreme pain and he's truly taken care of me without hesitation. However, I've been finding the right supplements and lately my health is on an upswing. Everything is perfect. 

Except there's no intimacy. We do have sex at least once a week. But there's no lead up to it. There's no foreplay. Many times he can't finish because he can't find a good comfortable angle or he's too hot, etc etc. There's always an excuse. 

He doesn't compliment me, he doesn't cuddle me, he doesn't sleep in the same bed as me, there's no cuddling after sex, he basically just never touches me, and there are no pet names. He doesn't say my name or call me babe or anything endearing. Romance and intimacy are zero. We hardly go on dates and he hates eating out. Maybe once a month or every other month I try to get him to go out to eat and I'll pay, but he's never thrilled and would rather eat at home. However, if his family is at the local bar watching a game, he never hesitates to go see them. 

We both work from home now. He works upstairs in his office. I made a space for myself in the basement. We don't see each other for most of the work day besides on my breaks. 

I've brought this up to him as something that really bothers me on at least 3 occasions. He gives the same excuses and I'm just tired of having empathy for them. If the roles were reversed, I would deal with being hot and uncomfortable if he had needs that weren't being met. He's promised to work on fixing it, but I feel like he just keeps moving the goal posts. Before it was that his sex drive has tanked because he was having trouble getting Adderall. But now that he has Adderall, nothing has changed. He begged me not to give up on him. 

Well, I finally gave up. It's been a year of these issues. He hasn't tried to make any changes and at this point I feel hurt that it's all a lie. I don't understand why it's so difficult to show me love. My self-esteem is tanked. For over a month I've completely checked out and have just been going through the motions. He hasn't even noticed. I'm not playful or cutesy with him anymore. I don't touch him anymore because it's not reciprocated. 

Last night I told him I've given up and we need to redefine our relationship. This obviously isn't a relationship that's heading to marriage. I don't want to go out and meet others, but maybe we can be life partners or something. 

His family stresses me out so much. They clearly don't like me. When I show up to gatherings, I get scowls and I just sit there and don't speak unless spoken to. I've put forth a ton of effort trying to get them to like me, but it's exhausting. If I bake or bring over something homemade, they don't touch it. His uncle seemed upset I brought pie to Thanksgiving and said, ""great, another  pie."" They ate the store bought pie instead. He's never really dated anyone in the time we were apart. I don't understand what I've done wrong to them. They barely know me and hardly ever ask me questions. Any joke I make, no matter how silly, gets taken WAY too seriously. I said I'd love to put a giant Christmas blow-up on top of the garage, and I got ganged up on by 3 family members demanding to know how I'd get it anchored without it blowing away. 

Of course, he sees none of this and says his whole family would be surprised to hear I think they don't like me. He always reassures me that they love me and ask about me when I don't come over. It just really hurts I've lost my father and went no-contact with my mom, and I wish I could just be accepted into the family. 

In the past month, he yelled at me for talking poorly about his uncle when I respectfully brought up my hurt feelings. He went to see his family for New Years Eve (I worked) and he didn't get home until 1.5 hours before the ball dropped so I spent most of the night by myself crying and waiting for him to come home. He told me he'd be home before I got off work, but he was an hour late. He didn't ask me what was wrong when he saw me crying. His mom invited me over, but I don't feel comfortable going over there if I don't have a full face of makeup and have myself put together. His family is very judgemental of others and I don't want to be judged more than I already am. I cried as I told him about an app that asks questions for us to get closer. We played it for a little bit but he never had good answers. 

His mom and dad seem to be tense around each other. I've never seen them affectionate with each other in the entirety of knowing them. 

He's always talking about how he's growing a deeper and deeper bond with my dogs. But I told him he's never once thought about trying to grow a deeper bond with me. 

I've bought a ton of lingerie, have tried to dress up nicely for him many times, always make sure I'm very clean/hygienic, etc. I've put in a ton of effort on my side but nothing works. There are MANY nights I'll wear lingerie under a robe and I end up just falling asleep. I've stopped initiating anything because I don't want to pressure him to do anything he doesn't want to do. 

I told him I gave up last night and he cried himself to sleep and hasn't said anything to me today. It always takes 1-3 days before he can come up with something to say to me after we have these conversations. 

TL;DR My (F29) boyfriend (M31) has zero intimacy with me. He says he's just not a cuddly person and makes up excuses. I feel so unloved. ",1,1736708993.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

We already have some local coffee roasters and local coffee shops offering to bring freebies for rewards, but I was wondering if anyone knows any pitcher companies etc. online that would be willing to donate any of their products? It's my first time hosting so I am completely clueless when it comes to these things :')

Also if you have any other suggestions for hosting a latte art throwdown I would love to hear them! (We will have food and drinks:))

**A Breaking Bad-inspired entertainment room, designed for fans of the series. The room features a large sectional sofa in dark gray fabric, arranged around a coffee table shaped like a barrel of chemicals. The walls are covered in soundproof panels, painted in alternating shades of black and white. A projector screen is mounted on one wall, displaying a paused scene from the show. The opposite wall is lined with shelves holding Breaking Bad memorabilia, including action figures, DVDs, and a replica of the RV. The lighting includes recessed ceiling lights and a floor lamp with a shade resembling a gas mask. A mini-fridge stocked with blue-colored drinks sits in the corner, next to a popcorn machine labeled ""Los Pollos Hermanos."" The floor is covered in a dark hardwood finish, with a rug featuring the Breaking Bad logo.**

**A modern living room designed for fans of *The Walking Dead* TV series, featuring a large, distressed wooden coffee table with the show's logo laser-etched into the surface. The walls are painted in muted grays and browns, with a feature wall showcasing a large, framed poster of the show's iconic walker silhouette. Recessed LED lighting highlights the poster, while a floor lamp with a rusted metal finish casts warm, ambient light. A leather sofa in deep charcoal is paired with throw pillows featuring subtle zombie-themed embroidery. A bookshelf displays collectibles like miniature walker figurines and replica props, while a vintage-style TV plays a loop of the show's opening credits. The room's layout emphasizes open space, with a rug mimicking cracked earth textures underfoot.**

**A cozy Game of Thrones-themed study, featuring a dark mahogany desk with intricate carvings of the Lannister lion. The walls are lined with bookshelves filled with leather-bound volumes and replicas of the Citadel‚Äôs maester chains. A large map of the Seven Kingdoms is spread across the desk, illuminated by a desk lamp shaped like a dragon‚Äôs head. The room is lit by a combination of warm table lamps and a ceiling fixture resembling the Night‚Äôs Watch oath. A plush armchair sits in the corner, draped with a House Targaryen banner, and a small side table holds a goblet and a replica of the Iron Throne. The floor is covered in a rich, patterned rug with motifs of direwolves and dragons.**

1hzu40u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1hzu40u/allday_walkable_area/,all-day walkable area?,"TL;DR - in search of an area to live where I could ideally walk out my door for various walks throughout the day, with restaurants and/or groceries in walking distance as well. To me, this would mean a walkable area with as much year round good weather as possible in a safe area.

Example: get up and grab a coffee and walk a couple miles, walk another couple miles over lunch, walk 6+ miles after work, maybe even grab a coffee and take a nice leisure walk after dinner. I don't mind having to drive a short bit to find a trail for longer walks, but I'd really love finding a place where I can literally just spur of the moment get in a few miles, especially in the morning and over lunch.

I know what I'm describing sounds like a stereotypical downtown, but I don't mind suburbs either. A suburban neighborhood close enough to a Starbucks would be plenty fine for me. Like most people here probably, I love the beach (and also the mountains), but I'm perfectly fine with suburban trails in the midwest, so I'm not very particular.

Context: For my health (weight and blood pressure mainly), I need to live somewhere where I can walk at least a couple hours every day, and ideally where I can do that year round without long stretches of freezing weather or the ground covered in ice/snow. I currently live in Kansas, where the winters (both temps and snow/ice) shut me down for weeks/months at a time. This results in decent weight loss and excellent health from about May to September, but by Dec/Jan I'm struggling with high BP and feeling heavy/lethargic from lack of exercise.

I've tried treadmills, stationary bikes, etc for bad weather, but I just get too bored to stick to it and I need the 'commitment' of walking a physical distance (IE walking a mile out means I'll have to walk a second mile back, etc.). I also seem more motivated by being out in nature or at least just outside.

In addition, the older I get the more I love hot weather and the less I tolerate cold weather (plus the heat helps out with the health benefits, lol). Having said that, I don't mind ""Seattle weather"" with moderate temps and rain. I really just don't like cold or treacherous conditions from ice/snow. I'm willing to walk in 50 degree weather or during a drizzle.

For context, I'm a mid-40s man, no wife or kids, and work remotely. I'm flexible in terms of things like living urban or suburban, house or apartment, etc. As mentioned, the big thing for me is a place where the outside is walkable year round, or at least doesn't have 3-4 months of shutdown winter.",1,1736708741.0,SameGrassButGreener,5,1.0,False

Week 1: 12.9lbs Lost

Week 2: 4.6lbs Lost

Week 3: 0.8lbs Lost

Week 4: 3.0lbs Lost!

Hi Everyone! 

I‚Äôm so excited to finally say that I‚Äôve officially lost 20 pounds :)

I‚Äôm definitely feeling a huge difference in terms of my energy and even how my clothes fit, so I‚Äôm encouraged to keep going.

This update will be pretty short because there hasn‚Äôt been too many new developments from the last few weeks. I‚Äôm definitely experiencing mild dry mouth, brain fog, jitteriness, and insomnia but I rarely notice it. The medication is absolutely managing my hunger quite well, but I have noticed I‚Äôve started having way more cravings. Even still, if I want something sweet, I‚Äôll choose to just have a yogurt and that‚Äôll satiate me pretty well and then I won‚Äôt think about it anymore.

I had my month check-in with my PCP and I‚Äôm responding super well to the medication, so the plan is to check in again in a month.

I‚Äôve read on here that some people‚Äôs PCP recommend they only take it for 3 months and then stop, so I asked her about that and she said my dose was low enough that I could continue to take it for as long as needed.

One thing I haven‚Äôt mentioned in my past updates that I really want to this week is: **coffee.** I‚Äôve been abstaining for the past month because it makes me feel horrible. No matter how much water I drink. No matter if I eat beforehand. I will have horrible stomach cramps or headaches and it‚Äôs just not worth it. I‚Äôm not someone who drinks a lot of coffee to begin with, so my caffeine tolerance is quite low, which might be why I certainly can‚Äôt drink it now.  So the 3 or 4 times I‚Äôve sipped a coffee, I absolutely wish I hadn‚Äôt. 

My PCP did mention that the weight loss would begin to slow down after the first month and stabilize to about 2 pounds a week at the caloric deficit I‚Äôm eating at, which totally works for me. 

My goals are to continue to count calories, drink my water, and exercise regularly!

1hzu0li,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hzu0li/struggling_making_sense_of_a_messy_relationship/,Struggling making sense of a messy relationship and how to move forward strategically,"I'm a 35m that dated this 40f on and off for about 3 years and I am having trouble understanding what happened in the end. I'm looking for insight or advice, or maybe a shared similar experience to help me make sense of all of this, and properly move on from her. There has been a pattern to this relationship that I refuse to partake in anymore.

\-We matched on Tinder. She messaged me first. She engaged with me. We went on a date, spoke a ton about our goals, values and what we wanted, and there was alignment. After about a month of dating she told me she had feelings and wanted to be exclusive. I accepted. First time someone ever asked me to be their gf.

\-She is a super busy mom of 3 kids and works two jobs. Our schedules conflicted often but when we hung out we would always have a great time, and the sex was incredibly passionate. Best ... I have ever tasted, I made sure she was always pleased. Over time I fell in love with her hard.

\-After about 2 months she said she needed space and was feeling stressed and wanted to be alone. She still had feelings for her ex-husband.

\-I was hurt. After granting space a couple weeks later she would message me seeing how I am doing and ask to come over for a coffee. She came over, we would open up about our feelings, told me she slept with her ex-husband, somehow I forgave her, we ended up making love, and suddenly we were back together.

\-Cycle repeated over and over. Every single time she was stressed she would totally disengage from the relationship. Every stress was different, sometimes it was money, sometimes it was because her car, sometimes it was family, sometimes it was because of her kids. Discovered attachment theory, found out she totally fits the description for someone with avoidant attachment. At the time I fit the bill for anxious attachment, and took a ton of therapy since then to become secured. I suppose that was a blessing in a way.

\-After a few times I said f this. Some of the times I got mad and told her off and blocked her everywhere, followed by unblocking and apologizing after I cooled down. Most of the time I just lovingly let her go, following dating advice from Corey Wayne to just love freely and let go, and focus on my purpose, and avoid difficult women. Ok.

\-But everyday I would think about her. Heck, I'd think her about almost every minute of every day.

\-Again she apologized, we got back together, nothing really changed although I found myself less attached and less hurt each time, thanks to therapy and also just understanding that it was nothing I did wrong. I discovered something important about myself - communication is the most important thing for me in a relationship. Whenever communication lacked, and she hid her feelings or thoughts, I suffered.

\-For the next while I gave it absolutely everything. I loved her with all my heart. Love notes, gifts, flowers, dates, accommodating her needs as best as I could...even when we had our struggles we had (and still have) no doubts that the love was real. We jammed with a band together. We really did have some great times, although they were far and few between.

\-She was always tired. Constantly exhausted from work and her kids. Felt like whenever we were together she would just give me breadcrumbs, all we ever started doing was chilling at her place and Netflix and chill. Soon her coparent scheduled changed from 1 week on to 2 weeks with kids at a time. She always wanted to spend quality times with her kids, which I respect and understand as I am a single dad too. I started to feel like I was missing out on life. In my opinion she never really had time or energy for a serious relationship and was kidding herself.

\-She took therapy because apparently the relationship was hard on her too. She expressed it wasn't what she wanted, and she didn't know what she needed, let alone how to communicate those things, and expectations of me. Sex was the strongest thing about our relationship but that was about it. 

\-Over time it just felt like she was not interested in anything to do with my life, or my thoughts and opinions. She would routinely disengage. I tried to not make much of it, after all we are different people. But we would go on dates and have nothing to talk about. All she ever talked about is her problems or her family, or gossip, and I am a nerdy intellectual who loves to talk about anything other than that stuff. The last time I stayed at her place was exactly like this. I thought were both just tired, but no. I asked her if everything was okay. She said yes. As soon as I got home though she opened up by text. It really frustrated me because I had told her many times how important it was for me to have these convos in person, but I guess by text is just how she prefers to communicate. Frustrating. Honestly never expected this level of immaturity from someone older than me, but hey another lesson learned.

I lovingly said ok all the best, you have my friendship but from here on out I am going to date someone else and have not heard from her since. Funny thing is I have already met someone incredible, and a good communicator, with 0 baggage...but I think I made the mistake of dating too soon. I am still grieving hard. I have told this person and she totally understands, but yeah.

I have no doubts that in the next few days or week my ex will text my ""how are you doing"", or ""have a good week"", and I got to be honest here, I don't know what the heck to do. In the past I have just matched and mirror, good thx hbu, ok, blahblah, take care! But it always reboots the cycle. I hate ignoring people. I think blocking is immature. I'm upset and sad, and in a lot of pain, and don't want to lie about my feelings to her, but I also don't want to make her feel guilty either and I also don't want to give her the satisfaction that this was the right thing. She has no idea what she lost. There are not many guys that will give someone so many chances, and make so many compromises. I do wish her the best, but am struggle finding the balance between feeling righteous about putting myself first, without being a total dick in the process.

I think I have been through enough. I think just peacefully ignoring her completely is the best thing to do. I have already gotten rid of all the photos of us together and deleted all texts. Now I just need to train myself to stop thinking about her when I catch myself reminiscing. I just feel so dumb. This relationship was far from logical and I don't know why I kept taking her back.

And my new gf is completely amazing. I feel like an idiot for still being in love with someone who treated me like garbage, all while not being able to give my whole self to this new person.

TLDR: Struggling moving forward from a messy relationship with an avoidant and looking for any advice you might have to help me stay positive.

With so many variables in coffee and espresso making (i mostly do espresso) its a bit tough to identify where issues many be if handling from beginning to end. grinder, roaster, time, bean type, flavor profiles, puck prep etc etc.

So, I've recently been gifted a hot air roaster called the mago maga roma pro which you can find [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D929R5L1) to get a glimpse. 

I have some ethiopian green beans that I hear is dense etc. Im just looking to get the best flavor out of the grean beans I have (5 different beans actually).

So Im curious as a starter like myself. What to look for?
I need to do this on manual because the auto profiles don't work the greatest.

a lot of air, a little air. I hear people mention roasting until a certain temp. First crack etc.

My issues mainly are. the precrack drying time and temp. Do I want to roast these beans up slowly until around 140c and then let them sit there a certain amount of time to dry out, before ramping them up until 210c or so where I want them to brown until I get a visual that I like and stop the roaster?

Sorry for being all over the place. I do love a medium roast and I hear thats pretty good for ethiopian beans to get the most fruit tasting and sweetness out of them..

The test run i did, i basically needed to put 22g in a 20g basket and grind a little finer than im used to in order to get close to a 1:2 raito between 27-35 seconds.

Im just trying to get a better understanding to jump start into this before full free fall diving lol.",0,1736708496.0,roasting,0,0.5,False

I don‚Äôt tend to follow what others do, but given a more recent diagnosis and not really getting many symptoms at all, I do try to observe others and their habits when relating to this disease.

Recently there has been one or two occasions where I have messed up and thought a cafe had gf oat milk, and just decided to drink it anyway. And a very small amount of times I have just thought, fuck it and will order it fully knowing it‚Äôs the wrong brand. I‚Äôm wondering for uk coeliacs if anyone else has admitted to doing this, and I guess how bad is it to have had oat milk given its not actually the oat itself that contains gluten but rather the manufacturing and crop rotation processes that link a potential for contamination? Like is it as bad as eating a slice of toast?

Is there any way to smooth/regloss/buff this texture without having to strip the table top?

I truly love my parents, and I know not every marriage is perfect, and having parents that are customed to the Asian household, romance and a ""happy"" marriage isn't ideal. But some people actual try to make it ""real"", for the sake of their kids. At least, my Mom does. My Dad, not so much. 

My Dad's side of the family are the type of people who talk behind each other and only talk when they want something. And I assume this isn't a unique experience. There have been multiple cases of ""Married-single-mothers"". And I feel like my Mom is in that category.

Let me explain from the beginning.

My Mom and her Mother and basically everyone on my Mom's side of the family are just the sweetest people alive - and I'm not being biased because my Mom is my Mom. My Dad's side has done nothing but hurt my Mother. 

When my Parents were meeting up for the first time - My Mom was quite excited (as any woman would be, to meet the person she'll be spending her entire life with (also because of the fact dating is not a custom in my culture).

So, my Dad sits on a chair beside my Mom, and my Dad's eldest Sister does all the talking; she yapped about how my Dad has a job in Canada, and owns two houses in one of the best cities. (Still my Dad hasn't said a word, only a simple nod and a shrug).

Now, that's happening, and from the get go you may or may not think it's a red flag. My Mom knew, but she didn't say anything, wanting to give time and get to know my Father.

Blah blah, my Mom's parents seem to like my Dad and ask my Mom about it all. (I don't know much cause I was never told everything). And then, my Mom said something along the lines of, ""yeah, he's okay. I'll marry him."" And her life hasn't been the same ever since. 

On the wedding day, my Dad was late, buying a suit at the last minute. On the wedding day, my Dad's younger brother was getting married at the same day in a different event hall, and his wife and my mom were in the same parlour getting ready. (Think this is a red flag? There's so much more). 

*Let me write names now - cause it's getting confusing. Dad = Faiyaz, Dad's brother (uncle) = Arjun, Uncle's wife = Ameera, Mom = Hira.*

Ameera and Hira were getting ready for their big day. After Hira's makeup was done, Ameera asked the makeup artist to do the same style on her. Ameera and Hira's wedding dresses were litteraly almost the same, except Ameera had more intricate designs in a nude color and adorned with gold jewels - while Hira had a simple neon magenta with simple bangles and a necklace. (See a favourite? I do)

Time skip to the wedding, (I don't know much), Faiyaz is late. Why? He bought a wedding suit at the last minute.

Hira's parents and family? Their car was never ordered. They had no idea where the event was held. (Crazy? It'll get crazier). 

Hira's sitting on the stage. There's food out. She's the bride, someone gets her food, it's the custom in the tradition. *No one gets her food*. Faiyaz is not on the stage, he's gone. Probably eating. Hira reaches into her small purse for a snack to dial down the hunger. There's nothing in there. Just empty wrappings of the two chocolate pieces she saved for herself. Who ate them? (you might ask). Who was sititng beside her on the stage? ***The Groom***.

You might think I'm being a bit unfair to my Father. Maybe I am, but what groom shows up late at his own wedding, and leaves his bride?

Now, let's time skip (cause I wasn't told much) to when Hira goes to Faiyaz's home (this takes palce in the home country, not in Canada). It's late, like two or three in the morning, but in that home, it feels as if it's two in the afternoon.

Hira, still in her wedding dress, now finally with Faiyaz is taken into a room for more photos. Faiyaz excuses himself for a moment, Hira is now alone with the photographer. She obviously feels awkward. Her Husband left her, and now she's alone with a stranger for wedding photos.

Time skip again (because i was never told any more information). Hira tries to go to sleep, but it's still too loud and Faiyaz is no where to be seen. She's still hungry, no one offers her food, or lets her into the kitchen.

Time skip (I wasn't told much), to when I'm born. My Dad is in Canada working. My Mom gave birth to me in the hospital. Blah blah, I was a premature baby and was smaller than most. I had surgery and some shit. Blah blah, I was raised by my mother and my grandmother and most of my Mom's side of the family.

And suddenly a day after Ameera's child was born (my cousin), both my Dad and his brother come back from Canada to the home country.

Hira, and Ameera, holding me and my cousin, are waiting at the terminal.

My Mom tells me that my Dad went to pick up my cousin (a boy), and held him first. I don't know why that hurt so much, but it does.

Blah blah blah, I'm close to a year old now, my Dad finally takes my Mom to Canada. Lots of shit happens. First he undermines her, telling the people at the airport that Hira can't speak english, (my mom proves him wrong - she topped with a 98 in english back in her final year of school).

Blah blah, we're living in toronto, WITH Ameera and Arjun and my cousin, in the SAME TINY two-bedroom APARTMENT. Like, *what the fuck?* 

So not only my mom shared a wedding day and went through all that shit, the first ever home is with them? But my Mom had never complained. I've seen the photos from the time, and she looked really happy and the room we had was neat and tidy (even if it only a shelf, a drawer and a mattres. NOT EVEN A BED), but she was happy.

What happened to the two homes my Dad had owned, you may ask. He sold them before the wedding day. He never told my Mom about it. Not on the wedding day, or the drive to the airport, not on the plane. Not once did he mention it till then. 

My Mom, being the absolute Angel she is, brushes the thing aside, and tries to live her best life.

*Now I'm going to summarize a lot of things since this thing is becoming too long*.

Years go by, we still don't have an actual home, always on rent and always moving around for my Dad's job. We don't have money for a car or actual furniture. We're just living.

(Ameera and Arjun live somehwere else after dumping the rent on my Dad. He forgave them saying, ""oh it's fine. He's my brother) And so my Dad found some other place to live. And years after my two younger sisters were born. The one-bedroom apartmenet was getting cramped. I'm seven, my sisters are babies. There's no room, and my Dad has no plan in moving.

Obviously Mm Mom pushed my Dad to find a proper job. He refused. She pushed on. Finally he got a Job in a good city after my Mom reccomended it to him. We move to a bigger place. A townhouse. Still on rent. But it's better than nothing. Everything's ""great"", right? For now, heck yeah.

Till it went downhill.

We moved again, needing a bigger space. My sisters are growing up, I'm growing up, the place was becoming a dangerous city. My Mom pushes my Father again.

He refuses.

My Uncle, Arjun, had secretly bought a place behind my Dad's back, TWICE, just before the mortgage and inflation went up. My Dad forgave his brother.

Arjun moved someplace far, which pushed my Father to move close to his brother. We're now in a better city. A great home in a great city.

Although it wasn't till in the last two years he changed. He barely spends time at home, saying that's working overtime with two jobs. *Sure buddy*. And then some other family members came over, for dinner. Faiyaz sits on the couch and invites them inside, and gives them cold drinks. Not his wife, who was coming into the room to set up the appetizer. Yeah, my Mom isn't a guest. But she's your wife, offer her a glass of water, you mf, she hasn't sat down all day.

As these two years go by, I start to realize more changes. My Dad only stays at home for maybe 8-10 hours. In those hours he's either sleeping, watching news on the TV or eating. Maybe he shares little conversation with me and my sisters, but it's usually lectures. But he's NEVER like that with his own family, or whenever we go to his sister's house for the holidays, or even at his brother's house for the weekends. He talks, like actual talks, and not just lectures about life with them. Like I'm sorry me and my sisters were born as a girl, and my cousins are all guys. 

Faiyaz always stands on my Mom's last nerve. She cleaned the entire home, she made you breakfast and dinner and looks after her kids. She cleans up your shit. She cleaned up your clothes that you threw in the closet. And my Dad comes home and sits on the couch to watch the news. Not even a ""how was your day"", to his wife or his kids. And when he does ask, that's all he says. And then he complains why we don't talk to him, when it always ends up into a lecture.

I always try to talk about things i like, for example what type of car I'm going to try to own in the future, or what college I'll try to get into. And he says, ""You shouldn't think so much for materialistic things. They don't last forever."" Like damn, I'm just trying to start a conversation.

I can't hate my Dad. But I really am starting to hate him. He made us move again because his friend lived someplace. He makes empty promises and has the excuse, ""I work hard so you can have a good life."" What good life? Sir, you're old. You're going to die once I graduate from college. You haven't invested in a home. You hadn't let my Mom complete college, saying ""You couldn't afford to do so,"" and you have the audacity to say, ""It's for the better"".

He expects to wake up late, at twelve at noon, with breakfast and coffee made for him - while my Mom was having her breakfast. (She never eats without him, but she did this once, and he was like, ""Where's mine?"".)

Sir, you are over five decades old. I'm sure you can pour yourself a cup of coffee and fry the fucking omelette.

And then, he made my Mom make him breakfast. And while she did that, he sits on the couch, takes the book from my hands and walks away with it. The book I was reading. Ignores my Mom as she sets breakfast on the table, and reads my book.

*So*, as a neutral audience. What are your thoughts? What do you think should happen?",0,1736708084.0,LifeAdvice,2,0.5,False

And decided to go cold turkey. I can say now that I've never been happier and that it really is a lot of fun to experiment with zero caffeine coffees loke chicoree, barley etc. 

One of the absolutely insane things I noticed since I stopped my caffeine intake and what I don't see mentioned a lot here is that my hate for headaches completely went away simply because I don't have them anymore. I always took meds for headaches about 3 or 4 times a week because they were so severe or just annoying. The headaches I have now are for some reason really light. I'm starting to really know my body now. If I have a headache then I either have to drink water, go outside for some fresh air or I've watched to much at a screen at the end of a day. It's really amazing how light and manageable they are now, like I really don't care anymore if I have them.

I've been trying to figure out how to get past my resistance to socializing so I can get my need for human contact met. It's been so bad that I have avoided going to family gatherings with my siblings and parents. 

I pushed myself to go to my nephew's bday as he turned three years old. In order to make it through, I had a few drinks to relax and turn off my anxiety. I haven't had a drink since the last time I was at a family gathering as I don't drink often. 

I had a great time at my nephew's birthday party and opened up to them all in ways I am not able to while sober. had fun playing with the kids and chatting with the other adults too. 

Anyway, I got relaxed to such an extent that I started texting old friends I lost contact with. I texted a close male friend and former colleague who I ran into at a soccer game in the summer. the text message I sent this time was a bit out of character and was exceedingly warm and friendly. I said ""hey bob hope you're doing well wishing you love and light!"" or something like that. 

He replied back  with three texts and I didn't respond. He apparently freaked out and thought I was sending him a last text message before unaliving myself. What he did next I was not expecting though. he got so worried that he went on a google search to find my dad's place of business, found his phone number and then called my dad at 11pm to tell him he is worried about my mental health and that i might hurt myself. 

this old friend used to be a big pothead so I think he was really high at the time and paranoid. I can't think of anything else to explain his line of reasoning. I did not tell him that I was depressed or struggling. He doesn't know anything of what's been going on with me. I just sent him an unusually friendly and warm text. 

i texted back and said ""bro did you call my dad? how did you even get his number? I'm totally fine I'm just in a better mood than usual and wanted to say hi."" he apologized for overreacting and said we should meet up and grab a coffee sometime.

1hztr88,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hztr88/aitah_for_telling_the_woman_ive_been_seeing_that/,AITAH for telling the woman I‚Äôve been seeing that she is selfish and I don‚Äôt want to see her anymore,"So for context, I (35F) met this person (43F, we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúSam.‚Äù) through social media. Sam found one of my videos on TikTok and left a pretty flirty comment, and then slid into my DMs. For the first two weeks the conversation flowed constantly; we would text nonstop and we really had a (what seemed like) a genuine connection and attraction towards one another. So we decided to see each other. I‚Äôm in the middle of a separation and was upfront with Sam about that, to which she said that was fine and she didn‚Äôt care. 

So I drive to the next state over to visit her, and I was supposed to stay with her for 2 nights. Those of you who are also in WLW relationships will understand that it‚Äôs pretty normal for things to move much quicker than in straight relationships, so this wasn‚Äôt something I wasn‚Äôt used to. Anyway, the morning of the 2nd day she called me out onto the patio and told me that we were ‚Äúfundamentally different,‚Äù and that it was best if I left to go home. So I grabbed my things and left. I didn‚Äôt argue with her and I stayed calm. Before I actually started driving, I sent her a text telling her that I really do wish the best for her and that everything works out for her. This was a genuine text and I meant absolutely no malice or sarcasm behind it. She then calls me and proceeds to SCREAM at me about how I need to fix things with my (now) soon to be ex spouse and I don‚Äôt understand what she‚Äôs going through. Again, all of this was out of the blue and I didn‚Äôt argue or scream back. I stayed calm but ultimately hung up on her after she laughed in my face and I told her that we‚Äôre adults and I‚Äôm not going to be her punching bag.

Fast forward a week, and I reach out to her again. I understand I probably shouldn‚Äôt have done this, but I wanted to have a genuine conversation with her where she could just tell me what was going on with her. Anyway, we decide to start talking again. A week later I go BACK up to visit her and everything is great! The sex was amazing, we connected and had amazing conversation and spent the whole time laughing and getting to know each other. She said I make her feel seen and bring a certain softness into her life that she was missing.

So we decide we‚Äôre going to make it a weekly thing of seeing each other. But this past week, her texts are shorter and shorter. Conversation doesn‚Äôt flow like before and the flirty conversations have all but disappeared entirely. I figure she‚Äôs just really stressed and busy and try not to read into it too much. She also has a lot of trauma that she hasn‚Äôt worked through, although if you were to ask HER, she‚Äôd argue to the contrary. Because of her trauma, her outlook on life is a lot more bleak than mine. Everyone leaves, everyone lies, no one actually stays. And yet she says that she gives a relationship a few months to get better before calling it quits. My relationship/marriage that I‚Äôm separated from has lasted 14 years! And she looks at that like a disadvantage, regardless of the fact that it is a testament to how committed I am in relationships. It‚Äôs like she snubs her nose at joy! I told her all the fun things I like to do during Christmas, for example, and she just gave me this weird disgust-like look and said, ‚Äúyeah you can have that. No thanks.‚Äù 

So this week again, I go up to see her. She had already said she wasn‚Äôt feeling well due to kidney pain so it was just gonna be us hanging out and whatnot. Which is fine. I don‚Äôt expect sex from anyone and that wasn‚Äôt the reason I was up there anyway. So I get up there, and aside from the peck on the lips she gave me when I came in, she didn‚Äôt show any affection towards me at all. Not holding my hand, putting her hand on my leg in the car, nothing. I thought this was weird, but again wrote it off as she just isn‚Äôt feeling well. The first night I‚Äôm there, we‚Äôre in the middle of a deep ‚Äúgetting to know you‚Äù conversation when she gets a call from one of her friends and excuses herself. I just stay seated on the couch and quietly wait for her to get off the phone so we can resume our conversation. 3 HOURS LATER and this woman is STILL on the phone with this same person, and what‚Äôs worse is she never once told the friend she has company earlier and would need to call her back later. So finally I just went to bed. She was still on the phone and I don‚Äôt know what time she got off.

During the night, she wanted to cuddle which I gladly welcomed. But the next morning we were back to being distant. So I just made me some coffee and did my normal routine. Around 10:30a she said she wanted to get out of the house and get a beer. It‚Äôs important to note here, that I‚Äôve seen this girl start drinking a beer at 7:30a and that first night I was there, she had gone from about 10 beers throughout the course of the day!

So I get ready to go to the pub and we head down to the car. It has snowed the night prior and there was ice on her windshield that got dumped into her seat when she was trying to get in. I laughed at the situation but she just looks at me and goes, ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt THAT funny cause now I‚Äôm pissed and we aren‚Äôt going anywhere.‚Äù So I get out of the car and home girl is just leaving me behind not saying a word while walking back up to her apartment. At this point, the vibe is just very off so I ask her if she‚Äôd like me to go ahead and head on out. Keep in mind, the plan was for me to stay until the afternoon and by this point it‚Äôs only 11:30a. She says yeah, so I grab my stuff and go home. 

So now we‚Äôre 2 for 3 of visits that have ended in her pissed off at something and the day is ruined. I have autism and she‚Äôs made passive aggressive ableist comments about how ‚Äúneurodivergent‚Äù should only apply if you are severely mentally and physically disabled where it impedes on your ability to function on your own. She also made a comment on the phone with her friend the other night about how a girl she knew was ‚Äústupid‚Äù because she doesn‚Äôt understand social cues. This woman has diagnosed autism. So now we‚Äôre 2-0 of negative comments she‚Äôs made about neurodivergence when she also knows that i myself have autism.

Her being on the phone that long the other night just felt like a massive FUCK YOU to me; like she didn‚Äôt even respect my time or even the fact that we‚Äôre were in the middle of something prior. Like I said, she never mentioned to the friend that she had company over. 

She did lose her mother 2 years ago, but I noticed in her apartment she has her mother‚Äôs ashes, and right next to them is a wooden spoon. I asked her what the significance of the spoon was, and she said it‚Äôs the same spoon her mom would beat her with! Like why would you decided to put THAT next to her urn. That that is what she chose to remember her mom with!

She didn‚Äôt text me at all yesterday after I left and she hasn‚Äôt texted me at all today, even though her socials show she was active 2 hours ago. The mixed signals finally got to me and I had enough. I attempted to call her but she didn‚Äôt answer, so I messaged her and told her that we are now 2 for 3 visits where she has treated me either like shit or like I wasn‚Äôt even a priority. I asked her what the point of me coming to visit even was if she was just going to go about her day like I wasn‚Äôt even there and never even made an attempt to prioritize time with me. I told her that I haven‚Äôt done anything to her and even gave this another chance when I probably shouldn‚Äôt have given how she behaved on the first visit. I also told her that I‚Äôm sorry her life has been so hard but the daily cynicism and misery in her attitude is a daily choice she makes that just leads to a miserable existence. I told her that if she wanted to, she would, and her actions speak a lot louder than what she says. I finally told her that if she decides she actually wants to put in the effort of dating me, she has my number. She never texted back and it‚Äôs been radio silence ever since.

Hi friends - my name is Jorge Vera, and I‚Äôm the owner of Finca Los Mangos, based in Pereira, Colombia.

About a year and a half ago I took over operations of the farm and decided to export our coffee. In partnership with my uncle - a life long farmer - we‚Äôve been working hard at creating a delightful product.

I‚Äôm proud to share that our coffee is now being bought green by a roaster in New Hampshire, and also roasted (which we do at origin) by shops in Washington, DC.

We are seeing great results for our buyers, with terrific feedback by their clients.

Direct trade can be a reality for those who give it a chance. And I believe we are particularly well equipped to work together with those who are interested in going that route.

If you have been contemplating on whether to take the chance and would like to learn more, please reach out. I‚Äôm happy to have a conversation and tell you how we work. In general, I‚Äôm also always happy to connect with people and share any lessons.

Wishing you all the best in 2025!

There is no budget for new couches, and I have three young kids anyway, so old ratty couches it is.

I threw a bunch of plants from around the house in front of the window the other day. I‚Äôd prefer them to be on some sort of multilevel plant stand arrangement, but all I have is this ikea coffee table lol.

Please help! Art placement advice is welcome too!

1hztg60,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/1hztg60/i_keep_attracting_the_wrong_type_of_people_on/,I keep attracting the wrong type of people on Tinder,"Hey, so Tinder offered me a huge discount for Platinum and I got it, and looking at the people who sent me a like made me really depressed. I really don't wanna share my profile in public, but I have regular photos really, selfies, some mirror pics, one pic made of me by someone else, photo with my dog etc, I have sorta feminine face so maybe that's a factor, and my bio is about my hobbies such as training MMA, riding a bike, watching movies, making coffee, and so on, with a little joke added too. 

I have written there that I don't drink, don't smoke, I don't like social media, I'm introverted and rather calm, but **almost everyone** who gave me a like is a type of person that brags about loving to get drunk, partying every day, boasting about having a mental illness and all that stuff that I do not like, and never, ever swipe on. It should be pretty clear from my profile I'm not interested in it. I have nothing against those people, they're just not a type I'm interested in dating, and I think that's a pretty reasonable position to have... 

Worst of all, since getting Platinum likes I am getting increased, but more than half are still people like that, while people I am interested in (more introverted, into similiar things, people I feel like have a compatibile personality and vibes) and see on the app rarely if ever seem to swipe right on me. It's not even about the looks, since in this department they're pretty alike... What could I be doing wrong? ",3,1736707054.0,SwipeHelper,4,0.71,False

*Salary*: 43,963.52. My gross salary this year was ¬£62,000, and I also received a ¬£1,650 bonus. This is what was left over after deducting: income tax, National Insurance Contributions, pension contributions, student loan repayments (I‚Äôm on plan 2), and taxes on benefits in kind (my work pays for my gym membership).

*Money from my husband*: ¬£17,201.15. Most of the bills come out of my account (with the exception of the internet bill and Sky) so this is the money he paid me throughout the year to offset that. We also sometimes pay each other back for food or groceries if there‚Äôs a particularly hefty bill, or for purchases for the house (new appliances etc), and he paid me his half of cruise we went on together. We do need to get a joint account, but the admin of switching over all of direct debits means we‚Äôve been putting this off.

*Gifts*: ¬£1,450.80. My mum tends to give me gifts as money, and we got married this year so there were some extra monetary gifts.

*Refunds*: ¬£1,014.24. I have had some rotten luck with trains this year, so there;s a lot of delay repays in there. Also, some expensive clothes that never arrived >:(

*Interest income*: ¬£177.91.

*Reimbursements from work*: ¬£175. 

**Money out - top twenty expense catergories**

*Rent and service charge:* ¬£14.971.41. Our flat is shared ownership, so we own 25% of it (with a mortgage, so more like 5% outright, lol). Though we do pay a lot in rent, I think overall it was worth it because we‚Äôre paying significantly under market price (both in rent terms and in ownership terms) for our flat, and by the time our current mortgage term ends (five years) we‚Äôll be in a position to buy the remainder of our flat when we remortgage, or move to another place with a heftier deposit. Having said this, it‚Äôs a big chunk of money to spend!

*Savings:* 11,288.60. This is how much money went into my savings account this year, but I also took some out to pay for wedding related expenses, a honeymoon, and also a lump payment towards our mortgage (to get under 80% LTV and so get better remortgage rates). Overall, my savings grew by 4,731.85 this year. Next year, we have one big holiday planned but no other major expenses, so I hope to not touch my savings for the next 12 months and just let them grow.
*
Mortgage:* ¬£10,110.80. This includes a lump repayment of ¬£2500 that I made before we remortgaged.

*Holidays:* ¬£5,573.81. We took one trip to Amsterdam, which I paid for outright (it was my husband‚Äôs 30th birthday present). We also went on a seven-day cruise around the Med with Virgin and a staycation in Kingston-upon-Thames, and my husband paid me back for half of those trips.

*Eating out and takeaways:* ¬£4,464.96. This covers all food outside of the house, coffee, and takeaways. It doesn‚Äôt cover drinks with friends (I put that under social life). Even so, it‚Äôs pretty huge - part of this is because we‚Äôve eaten at some nice restaurants this year, but a solid chunk of it is work lunches and coffee. If I were to save more aggressively/needed to cut back, this would be the first place I‚Äôd go.

*Wedding:* ¬£4,432.69. We had a very small wedding (twelve total) with family help, so it wasn‚Äôt expensive as it would have otherwise been, but this was still a fair chunk of change! Most of this was our wedding rings, venue costs, and my clothes (my wedding dress and accessories cost around ¬£900).

*Utilities:* ¬£3446.01. We have a pretty good deal on all of our utilities; the outlier is council tax, which is ¬£160 a month.

*Groceries:* ¬£3243.76. This includes cleaning stuff, things like toilet paper, shampoo etc. (but not fancy skincare). We aren‚Äôt too price conscious here, and mostly shop at Sainsburys and M&S, but we‚Äôre an ingredient household so we do ok.

*Transportation:* ¬£1733.52. This included four long distance train journeys (two to north Wales, two to Glasgow) so I was pleasantly surprised with how low this was. I don‚Äôt drive, so everything else is public transport, which I usually pay for on Oyster (easier to claim refunds if something goes wrong!) I also didn‚Äôt take a single Uber this year, which I‚Äôm happy about.

*Gifts:* ¬£1648.07

*Entertainment:* ¬£1609.09. Cinema trips, days out, theatre shows, books, and video games.

*Subscriptions:* ¬£1435.50. I‚Äôm into family history, so I have quite expensive subscriptions for that - Ancestry and Find My Past. I also have Mubi Go, which costs ¬£18.99 a month but which gives me one free cinema ticket a week as well as the streaming app. Other streaming services I have are Prime, ITVX, and AppleTV+. I also subscribe to a fair number of newspapers and magazines: NYT, New York Magazine, London Centric, Vanity Fair, The Guardian, and The Times.

*Technology:* ¬£1391.80. I bought a new phone this year and also built a PC - my husband got some parts from work, so this covered the remainder of things I needed.

*Clothes:* ¬£1283.33.

*Social life:* ¬£1076.80. Mostly drinks with pals - lunches and dinners are covered elsewhere - with some activities like Junkyard golf thrown in. 

*Beauty:* ¬£874.35. Skincare, make-up, and gel manicures approx 4 times a year (I had an extra one this year for my wedding.)

*Debt repayments:* ¬£833.93. I don‚Äôt have an interest-bearing debt, but I used Klarna to buy a Dyson Airwrap and a new desk this year, just to spread the cost across three installments. These are now paid off. We also bought our sofa on an interest-free installment plan, so that‚Äôs covered here too.

*Household:* ¬£782.46. We bought a new hob, new tumble dryer, and paint for our living room.

*Insurance:* ¬£398.40. Life insurance for me and my husband and contents insurance. Buildings insurance is covered by the service charge, I have income protection through work, and we don‚Äôt have a car so no need for that.

**Overall thoughts:** This didn't feel like an expensive year at the time - we never struggled for money, and I had enough stashed away to meet some unexpceted expenses - but looking back it really was quite a pricy year! I would really like to focus on building up our savings in 2025, ready to take maternity leave in 2026 (touch wood). But, at the same time, we are enjoying having relatively good incomes and enjoying doing things we won't be able to do once we have children, so I do want to enjoy myself in the next year as well.",16,1736706862.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,5,0.94,False

12 oz bag of either whole bean or ground coffee with free shipping 
*2 or 4 week delivery options

Atlas Coffee Club

First bag is either free or half off depending on the current offer. Shipping is $4.95
* 2 or 4 week delivery options 

You can choose from 6 oz, 12 oz or 24 oz size bags.  I really appreciated all the different options for how you want your coffee ground. You can select whole bean or from 6 different ground types ranging from a course cold brew to a fine espresso. 
The coffee bags themselves are beautifully designed with the current region on the bag, so each month is a different design. Plus you get a postcard about the area and coffee farm. I really like that extra touch. You can also earn points to redeem on future shipments. 


Mustache Coffee Club 

First bag is a 6oz bag for a $1 

You can choose between 6oz or 12oz for either $14 or $24. Then you choose your shipping schedule of either weekly, every other week or monthly. You get to pick which coffee you would like and you have the option to skip shipments as well. 


Koffee Kult

2oz free sample 

You can get a free sample without having to subscribe to anything. 
Their subscription is a bit different than other websites. You can pick from their many different varieties and if you choose to subscribe you get up to 15% depending on how often it‚Äôs shipped. For example 3 weeks is 15% off while 12 weeks is 5% off. Shipping is free over $49. 


Probably once a year I Google coffee subscriptions and sign up for all the ones who are free or close to it. Year to year I forget whom I ordered from or they just are no longer in business. Which is why made this post. 
I absolutely love getting freshly roasted mailed to me. Upon opening my mailbox I can already smell the amazing coffee I‚Äôm about to drink. I was not disappointed by these coffees at all. The different companies all have amazing coffee. I kept with Atlas because of the extra touches. They let you view your past coffee shipments and the region it came from. And the reward points add up quickly too. 
Now these are subscriptions so if you don't cancel you will be changed for next shipment. After you place your order go back to the website, sign in and adjust your shipment schedule, some just default to 2 weeks. Or skip the next or if so decide cancel. I cancelled all of them except for Atlas. 

Here are my links to get an additional discount. Sign up and get that free bag then cancel it. Sign up again with my code to get another discount using a different email address. ENJOY!

As the title says I had my phone for 4+ years now, imo it works great, still feels crisp, no problem with the performance.

Some issues with it though:
- battery at 70% capacity compared to max
- screen is damaged from accidentally placing them on those coffee mug warmer (I thought it was a wireless charger üò≠) and the screen around the power button had a yellow tint, otherwise the screen works even in that tinted area. 

I was thinking if it‚Äôs worth paying few hundred dollars and get the screen and battery replaced and keep using it for another 4 years or something.

It‚Äôs 128 GB so maybe upgrading it to 256 GB is also nice to have but not required rn.

What do y‚Äôall think? Do you think 12 pro max will be supported long enough to justify the repair? Or save the few hundos and put it towards a new phone in couple years time.

Thanks guys.

Cut to this morning, my husband got her up and ready for the day so I could have a slower start to my morning. I walk into the kitchen to make coffee and she wants to make green juice. Cool. We go through the motions and right before I turn the blender on, she decides to change her mind and is livid about it. There‚Äôs no backing out at this point because I‚Äôm not wasting produce. I explain to her why we can‚Äôt just change our minds and that we have to mix it up. She has a full fucking meltdown. That passes.

Went back to drinking in 2022 during a low energy period and have tried quitting ever since, with the longest successful period being 3 months.

I always go back to drinking coffee because interactions with caffeinated people feel off.
They are so agitated and stressed, you feel so calm and grounded.
They constantly ask what's wrong with you, wether you are depressed, why you don't laugh frentically to their unfunny jokes, why you don't feel emotions when all they are doing daily is going through stress roller coasters that look like ""emotions"".

When you are jolly at 9am because you have constant energy and they look like hell because they haven't had their 10th coffee yet, they ask what you are happy for.

I feel amazing off coffee, my mind doesn't race, I'm in full control of my movements, I listen calmly to people and react in a thoughtful way, but I feel forced to play the coffee game just to have normal social interactions without being judged as the ""depressed"" one just because I am calm and collected.",7,1736705838.0,decaf,7,0.89,False

Until 2 weeks ago i had 0 problems with my stomach. I never had GERD symptoms, pain, problems with my appetite. The only problem i had was a general case of bloating. To be honest, i never knew if it‚Äôs bloating or being overweight. (90 kg/ 187 pounds - 175 cm/ 8‚Äô9 height). I started a diet, i counted my calories, i ate a lot more healthy and lost over 10 kg/ 22 pounds in 6 weeks. Important note, i work as s barista and i consume a lot of coffee (on a normal basis 6-7 espresso per day). Another important note, throught the diet my first meal was usually at 16:00/ 04:00 PM, and i started my days with a lot of coffee and e-cigarretes. Normaly i eat around 1000-1500 calories per day. 

The problem: All the problems started 4 weeks ago when i started to have sharp chest pain, mild stomach pain, one episode of sore throat that lasted  8 hours. One day i had such a constant and sharp pain throughout the day that i had to go to ER. The doctor said that everything seems fine (lungs, hearth and blood tests). 2 weeks past and i still wake up every morning with these symptoms: sharp pain in the chest, mild stomach pain, reflux. All these symptoms fade if i eat, don‚Äôt drink soda/ coffee and smoke less. Mainly, i have acid in the morning and stomach pain that radiates. I tested negative for H Pylori. I will go run some aditional analylis this week. 

Does it seem like a gallbladder problem? Or a mix of more problems? üòû",1,1736705827.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False

Last night I had a dream that I was becoming a cop. I was joining the police force and I was going to work at the airport. 

The day before my first day on the job, I went to some store in the mall to buy a sort of wrist-watch that they only sell to cops. But they wouldn't sell it to me. I tried to convince them that I was a real cop. 

Then it started to dawn on me...why would *I* become a cop? Isn't this totally against my values? Whatever happened to ACAB? What am I doing? How did I get here?



I also dreamt about a bunch of people all dressed up for a formal party. They were blocking traffic. I asked them what the occasion was and they wouldn't tell me. I said ""Ooh, how mysterious. A SECRET event. Very cloak and dagger."" 

I didn't glean much insight from these dreams but I'm glad to have at least remembered them. 

I was going to hang out with my friend K. today, but she wanted to go to the game store to look for Warhammer stuff. 

I can't take my son to the game store when I'm in no position to buy him anything. I told her that I wanted my son to have a fun weekend too but that the game store would be a taxing errand for him and that I had no way to motivate or reward him.



K said that he should be able to be respectful and well-behaved without needing a reward. She said, learning to do that will be useful to him in adult life. That, you have to go to work every day without a reward.

""No,"" I said ""You're *supposed* to be rewarded for your work. It's actually illegal for your boss to make you work and then not reward you."" 

I wish K would not be so strict on my son. She scolds him for random shit that he's not doing wrong. Tells him that he's not being respectful towards me. One time she scolded him for putting stickers in the backseat area of my car. 



The stickers don't hurt anything. He's the only one who sits back there, he's allowed to decorate his space. Even prison inmates are allowed to decorate their space. 

I understand that K and I both had shit childhoods but... I'm not trying to give the same to my son. He's a child and he's allowed to have the tolerances and preferences and motivator/reinforcement needs of a child. 



He doesn't have to always exercise the skills that will be ""useful to him in adult life"" yet.    
  
He's not in adult life. Childhood is the cushion for him to launch from and fall back to in his memories. It should be soft.   
  
I need to be more productive today. I need to get some lesson planning done.  
  
Yesterday my husband (dear to me though he is) melodramatically moped around saying that I had caused him to have an excruciating and debilitating headache by delaying his coffee intake.    


I (unknowingly, unintentionally) delayed his access to coffee by five minutes tops (and that's being generous). I had no way of knowing he was about to use the coffee maker to make his first cup of coffee of the day, at 2:30 in the afternoon.   
  
But, in any case, this alleged injury that I had inflicted upon him caused him to be unable to assist much with childcare.   
  
So, this afternoon, when it's his turn to watch our son, I need to actually leave the apartment and go to a cafe and get some space to myself to work on my lesson plans.   
  
I feel so unmotivated now that I feel that my job is in danger. That, the school is going bankrupt.   
  
I hope I hear back from that other school I interviewed at soon.   
  
I technically do have another job where I'm technically a remote ""educational consultant"". But...they have been so disorganized. I had my onboarding. I had one zoom meeting.   
  
I haven't received any of my assignments/tasks from them. It's like they have me on the backburner in case they wind up needing me at some point in the future.   
  
I understand. I always have contingency plans on the back burner. It's a very cut-throat, dog-eat-dog world in this economy.   
  
In this...dystopia. This cyberpunk dystopia. Won't it be more fun if I imagine all these hardships in the context of some sci-fi setting?  
  
I'm listening to the Kushiel's Dart audio book on my long commutes right now, at the recommendation of my Discord friend. It's fine. It's well written. 

It's not the type of fantasy world I like to escape into. I need to finish it, so I can keep giving her my feedback and perspectives. 

This is a social bonding activity. 

But I am looking forward to finishing the book and finding a new story to contextualize my experiences within. ",1,1736705711.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

Previously he was a super reliable person and someone I even looked up to (he‚Äôs older than me). Very reliable but since this has happened his life has been on a downward spiral. Prior to his arrest (some of this is just what he relayed to me as the story of any of it doesn‚Äôt make sense or feels like he may be lying let me know) he had already planned on moving and subsequently communicated his 60 intent to vacate however after getting out of jail and beginning to look for a new place he wasn‚Äôt able to pass the background checks for any new places. Hence how he ended up living with us. He has some kind of release from jail until his trial where he has to check in with the county court and he has been doing so faithfully and has passed all of his drug tests (as far as I know). The issue is in 2019 he had purchased some mushrooms and they are saying that the mushrooms were soaked in meth. (I have known my cousin for over 30 years and never known him to even be drunk I was SHOCKED to find that he even purchased the mushrooms but he said he was visiting with an ex of his and they wanted to have a ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù experience but chickened out hence why they still had them when he was returning.) Anywho, so he swears that there was no way there was any meth on them and that he has never even seen meth before. So Friday afternoon he has his phone on speaker talking to his lawyer and his lawyer is saying that the lab tech that performed the analysis of the mushrooms also said there was coffee and tobacco found in the test but get this, no actual mushrooms (or at least whatever the active ingredient in mushrooms is I forget the full name) so his lawyer is saying how HE feels he has a good chance of getting it dismissed.

But here‚Äôs the thing when we agreed for him to live here he had stated that he was going to be taking a plea bargain where he would do 3yrs of probation and somehow that would make it not go on his record but of course he would be saying he‚Äôs guilty‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a weird situation imo‚Ä¶ but basically he could get back on track relatively shortly and he could begin applying for his own place again.

I love my cousin he‚Äôs always been there for me but it has been a serious challenge for us all to be under the same roof. I don‚Äôt want him to pass up a chance for time case to be completely dismissed but I also wouldn‚Äôt be able to help him with a place to stay if things go wrong. If his lawyer can‚Äôt get it dismissed he will not have a chance to take the deal he already has on the table. But if it was successful and it got dismissed then he could immediately begin looking

My wife and I are wanting so much to be good to our family but ngl this is becoming too much and he‚Äôs looking to me to offer feedback because neither of us have much experience with the law.

I‚Äôm clueless as to the best course of action but I‚Äôm hoping for any kind souls out there with advice or experience be willing to take the time to offer. We are grateful in advance.

So the goal is to collectively uplift the business fraternity of the twin cities. For that, we're starting a series of weekly networking meetups with the first one being next week, where we will not only be in the company of other capable people with high goals, but also maybe make friends that could help eachother along the way in different areas.

Our meetups will be in a cafe / coffee shop that shall be disclosed only to the people that are verified. This is only for the folks in the Twin Cities (Rawalpindi & Islamabad), and here's how you can join.

To be a part, [join the WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CxH4NoHVb8mEoD5RatkByS), and then fill out the form which will be shared in the group. The form will be a short vetting process that allows me to maintain the quality of our group.

b) have employee(s)
c) are already generating revenue
