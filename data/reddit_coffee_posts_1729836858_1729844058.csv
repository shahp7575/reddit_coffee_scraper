I work in advertising (but currently freelancing to pay the bills) and recently sent a blind email (along with a cover letter and my portfolio) to an agency I really love. They hit me back in about 30mins and set a meeting request. 

Meeting was meant to be about half an hour but I ended up chatting with the director for around 2 hours. Seemed like we had a really great back and forth and were on the same page about so many things. 

There was no real chat about whether or not there was an actual job at said agency, outside of the fact that they were “hopefully looking for someone to fill a more senior role soon”.  (Btw I’m in a senior role).

1gbp7cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1gbp7cn/its_already_been_3_years/,It’s already been 3 years,"In a week it’ll be 3 years, I just can’t handle it. It’s just all so much and I really find it hard to keep my mind right many days, but this week is the hardest week I’ve had since the my grandfather passed… but he isn’t just someone I visited once a month or on holidays, he raised me he was my father.. because my father left and died when I was a  young kid.. And to top of all this sh*t I can’t handle my step father emotionally and physically abused me when he was around and he finally apologized like 6 months ago and now he disowned me.. and I feel like how I did 3 years ago, like helpless little kid who was left by every father figure I’d ever known.. and I am so lost and so sad and so sorry I didn’t get him for more time, my grandpa.. but I wanted to post alittle about him and me and what happened, to help me process and get it out of my skull as it keeps replaying and echoing through my thoughts. Here is my slice of life

Growing up I spent a lot of time with my grandparents. The day I left the hospital after being born I went to my grandparents house before I went anywhere else. I lived with them for a while too and I did everything with them. I remember for a long time my grandpa would come scooting down the hallway in his little scooter every morning.
	“Good morning sweetheart.” he would say softly to me, as my brothers would still be sleeping in the front room so we had to be quiet.
“Good Morning grandpa.” I would whisper as I jumped out of bed to give him a giant hug and a kiss on the cheek. I could hear my grandma in the kitchen already brewing a hot pot of coffee and getting ready to make breakfast. Grandpa would humor my random babbling as we went down the hallway past the kitchen. 
“Would you go with grampy to get the paper sweetie?” my grandma would kindly ask me. 
“Of course grams!” I would say in such excitement. 
This mundane task was the pinnacle of my morning. I loved to go and get the paper because my grandfather always loved to read to me. I would run out and grab the paper from the edge of the driveway while my grandpa was waiting in the doorway. The neighbors riding on their bikes would always wave hi. Then, I would run back inside and we would go to the kitchen counter. It was like one of those counters that you could sit at and was connected to the kitchen if that makes sense. I would climb up on the tall chairs and sit on the countertop. 
“Can you read me my horoscope? Please, Please, Please!” I would ask in excitement.
“Of course sweetheart, now what is yours again?”
“Aquarius.” I would always try to say but I would say it like aqua- air- us.
 He read me my horoscope every morning by the way. As my grandpa would read to me, my brothers would mosey out of bed by the smell of scrambled eggs. I'll never forget my grandpa’s favorite way to eat eggs, Sunny side up with pepperoni slices and ground pepper. I used to think It was nasty but now it's the only way I like to eat my eggs too. If little me knew could see into the future, they would have cherished every moment, even the smallest most mundane moments with their grandpa as much as they could. 
My grandma always brought us to and from school and would come out with my grandpa to many of our school, sports, and other events that we did. My grandpa wasn’t lazy, if he could have helped my grandma cook, clean, and drive us to and from school activities he would in a heartbeat. My mom told me that while she was growing up he did everything. From coaching little league soccer to becoming a driving instructor, he was so involved and helped out with anything and everything. I took for granted the relationship and love shared between me and my grandpa. I used to think of him almost as a burden for my grandma but looking back it was actually the opposite. He was the best guy and an even better husband to my grandma. He would spend all his day trying to make her happy. He had something wrong with his muscles though, I think it was some type of degenerative muscle disease, and it made him so upset that he couldn't do a lot anymore. He couldn’t walk, drive, go to the bathroom by himself, ect. But this never stopped him from loving us to the moon and back. 
To me, my grandma is the best example of undying love on this whole planet. Everyday she would lift my grandpa,who is not a little guy, in and out of bed. She would help him get dressed, go to the bathroom, sit in his chair, and bring him to different places all the time. She did this everyday with a smile. She never, not even once, thought about leaving his side.
	As we all got older, my grandpa got worse. I remember when he still would try to walk. It was scary, he would hold onto the wall for dear life and as a kid he seemed like a lumbering giant that could fall at any moment. He couldn’t even stand anymore after a few years. My grandma still lifted him everyday, now with the help of my older brother.  My grandpa would have my older brother do things for him all the time. “Could you help me trim the bushes” “Could you help me rake the leaves?” Could you help clean the garage?” Ect. My brother, like my grandma, would do it all with a smile. Even when my grandpa would get frustrated because he could not help, my brother never got mad at him. He was like me and my brother's number one man. If we needed anything, if he could help he would,And he did it all out of love for us. Now that we entered high school, My grandpa still made an effort to come to all our home football games and sometimes come with my grandma to get us from school too. He was always tired though. He would get home and go straight to sleep in his chair because he was so exhausted. We held a surprise 50th anniversary party for my grandma and grandpa. Everyone came down from New York, where they were from, and everything was so happy. My grandpa loved it but he  became exhausted quickly too. I could tell he was tired, but he stayed out at the party out of love for everyone. That’s how he was, no matter how much he was in pain, he stuck it out because he loved his family.
During my senior year of high school we drove all the way down to our rival school for a football game, the drive was like two hours away. Honestly it was the best game in our football team's history. We beat them badly and the whole crowd from my high school was screaming with joy. We walked out with our heads held high and we were so happy, But the game is not what I remember about that night. On the ride back home my brothers and I were ecstatic and all over the place. After recalling our great plays and the referee's bad calls, the car went quiet as we scarfed down the little sandwiches that the team gave us before we left. 
“Grandpa’s not doing so well.” my mom said out of nowhere.
“What do you mean?” my brother asked her
“He’s going into the hospital tonight. Your aunt booked a plane ticket to come down.”
“Is he going to be okay?” I asked not knowing if I wanted to know the truth or if I wanted a sugar coated lie.

“…” 

Silence.



Little did I know the hardest week of my life was beginning. My aunt and her family were down by the next morning and my grandpa was in the hospital. For a few days he was in the hospital and we went to visit him. At first I thought he was going to be okay because they said he was coming home, but that’s not what coming home ment. The hospice guys set up the bed in the room I always stayed in because it was conveniently located in the house. He would be awake, then asleep, then awake, then asleep. He was like this all four days he was home. I sat by his side every second of those days.
 “MAX?” He yelped out once during those four days
“I’m here gramps  I'm right here.” I would say to him as I held his hand tight. Tears started to roll down my cheek.
“Is it morning yet?” He asked me while nodding off again. 
“Yeah it is, it’s like 9 o’clock” I told him, hoping he was still awake
“Oh is it? Well then,good morning sweetheart.” He said softly
I kissed on the cheek as always as  he fell back to sleep. I wish he could have stayed awake longer.

 He sounded so scared, he sounded so afraid at first. I was right there holding his hand and he calmed down. As Monday night rolled around my mom came up to me 
“Honey, you need to go to school tomorrow.” my mom told me. “It will be good for you to get out of the house.”
“No.” I told my mom in anger “I can’t leave him, I can't leave him yet.” I yelled at her, sobbing, crying like my life depended on it. my mom just looked at me for a bit.
“Okay, but you have to go to school on Wednesday.” 
I think this was God’s  gift to me. This fight I had was God’s way of keeping me by his side. I stayed up all night with him. Everyone who stayed at my grandma's house either stayed up or slept with one eye open. I wish I could say he died in his sleep, but that luxury wasn’t afforded to him. Suddenly he panicked, he panicked and there was nothing we could do. He was frantic and sounded scared with his noises and small moments. I called out for someone to come, I tried to calm him but he was so frantic and scared and I couldn’t do anything and then all of a sudden there was nothing.

“Grandpa?” I whispered

…

“GRANDPA” 


He was gone.


As he died, I thought I died too. It felt like someone stole my soul and left the husk of my living body to rot and decay. It felt like I couldn’t keep going. Honestly I don’t know why I did, but I decided to keep going. Maybe for mother or grandma, or maybe for brothers. Whatever it was, my mind decided that it was worth it to keep pressing on. A month passed and his funeral was held. So many people who I didn’t even know came up to speak about his impact on them. I learned here it was his dying wish to be at home with his family. That's why he came home. He was loving, kind, compassionate, and always willing to help out. He was the best brother, husband, father, and grandfather ever. 
I feel as though many kids, like myself, do not appreciate something until it comes to an end. I can tell you that I never appreciated my grandpa until he was taken away from me. I never appreciated the precious moments he created with me and the love he instilled the very fibers of my being. From this I’ve come to appreciate the big and small moments in my life. I’ve come to appreciate my family and friends too. I just can’t seem to come to terms that he’s really gone, I just can’t believe he really left me here. I see him everywhere and hear him every where and it messes with my head. I just miss him and need him here. everytime I eat my sunny side up pepperoni eggs, read the horoscope, or wake up to my grandma calling me in the morning, my grandpa is still there in my heart saying “good morning sweetheart.”

Well I blow a kiss to you to and I hope you know that I miss you…

1gbp523,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1gbp523/he_lives_amongst_you/,He lives amongst you ,"A shadow was cast over us. A silent shriek that haunted history since we first took breath. While our ancestors feared the predators luring in the dark, they missed the monster hiding amongst them. He has no origin. He has no soul to call his own. His only reason to persevere is to feast on our suffering. Or so I was told.

Throughout the recorded history only a few noticed his presence. I would have never learned of this foul beast if it hadn’t been for my father, who taught me once I was old enough. A family secret passed down the generations, bound to an oath to avenge the fallen. I wish my father would have taken the truth to the grave.

At first, I believed him to be mad; the beast was nothing but a ghost of his tormented mind. But the evidence he showed me convinced me of the opposite. In many human catastrophes, countless blood baths, or killings of innocence, he had his hands in. From the dawn of our species to now.

The writings my father revealed to me seemed a crude joke at first. But the more he amassed on me, the more my mind struggled to deny the truth. Once I saw the pictures, my skepticism died. A shade striving through human filth. Every step he took sent waves throughout the place he had infiltrated.

Sometimes he orchestrated entire uprisings that could only end in blood with only crows reigning supreme over the graveyard he had filled. Though more often than I would like to believe, all he needed to do was a minute action. Nothing but a little push to cause a ripple that would summon a tsunami. 

An unfortunate accident of someone important or the right words whispered into the ears of a future terrorist. Despite my extensive studies of the beast, I can’t tell how he knows who or what to influence to bring his wanted outcome. Perhaps he can see the future or all the different potential futures. Perhaps he is just guessing, and only his successful attempts have been documented. His failures would remain unknown to us. If there are any.

As to what I believe, I think the beast can glimpse into the human heart. It can decipher what we carry in our chest, hidden even from ourselves. With this information, the beast can play every human to a degree where it appears to be mind control. His capabilities are more akin to rewriting fate; as if he put us all on a determined path that would bring nothing but destruction.

This, at least, is what my father, my family, and every other doomed soul believed about him. To explain further, dear reader, you have to indulge me. Before unmasking the beast, I have to describe what brought me to the point of writing it all down so other people could learn of this thing. Then you will understand.

As I said, my father opened my eyes to the harsh truth when I was an adult. But even before that, I could tell something was wrong with my father. He always appeared to be preoccupied. As if something was haunting his mind. Father never cared for any of my interests or me in particular. Me and mother were nothing but noise irritating his important work. I asked Mother a few times why Father behaved in such a way. She knew about the beast, but I can’t tell when Father explained it to her.

“You will see, Jonathan,” she used to say. “Soon you will see.”

The only time Father invested his precious time into me was due to my education. Anything besides the best wasn’t good enough. Father never raised his voice against me or hit me, but he punished me with silence. His eyes were always cold, but when I couldn’t meet his high expectations, they gained a certain loathing for me. Before his disinterest would originate from a genuine lack of care, now it would arise from disdain. Only when I redeemed myself did he cease.

Praise was a rare occurrence but when it came, I held on to it like a thirsting man to water, using up every bit of it in my fruitless attempt to satiate myself. Mother was much the same. It might sound cruel, but I don’t think of her as a person. She served more as an extension to my father. She never spoke about the time before she met him. The way she acted you would think there was no such time. I don’t know what she saw in him to cast aside her identity and any hope for a loving husband in favor of my father who appeared to have lost all interest in her once I was born.

The only reason to be intimate with her was to create me. Nothing had any sentimental value in the eyes of my father. It was nothing but a means to an end. My mother to birth an heir, and me to carry on the family oath. An oath inherited from father to son for lord knows how long. My family history is not something I enjoyed to study. It is filled with tragedy and agony; much brought on by my ancestors themselves in their obsessed drive to hunt the beast.

I can only speculate how my grandfather treated my father, but by his hostile demeanor, it couldn’t have been better than my upbringing. Worse by the way he screamed in his sleep. Whatever it was, Father never dared to speak it out loud, but it influenced his every action and instilled him with the drive to end this generational-spanning pursuit. I shared this desire to end it all, as the thought of putting a child of mine through the same training I went through filled me with dread.

Every waking hour was focused on strengthening my body and honing my mind. I had to endure several harsh years of combat training and study concerning the beast. All for increasing my chance to not just survive an encounter with him but to also defeat him. Despite my father’s many shortcomings, he knew his craft and how to pass on his knowledge and skill to the next generation.

In these years I learned to hate my father in earnest. Before that, I was afraid of his judgment and yearned for his approval. But after receiving his complete attention, I came to understand that my father’s opinion shouldn’t be something to be taken into consideration. But I stayed. I stayed by my father’s side and did everything he told me to do.

After just a year, I had all the expertise to flee his grasp and survive on my own. Then why didn’t I? Easy, he had a point. The beast had to die. The fallen deserved to be avenged. And while my father was someone that I didn’t owe anything to, he was my best chance in eliminating the beast.

I think it was during the fourth year of my training that my father either thought I was prepared enough, or he couldn’t wait any longer. He was possessed by the wish to be the one who defeats the beast and puts an end to his secret reign. Gathering all the intel we had on the beasts, collected over countless decades by my family, we crafted our plan.

Based on all we had on the beast, we could narrow down his current location and identity. The beast wasn’t just a master manipulator but also a genius actor. How many different characters he made up over his long existence to blend into human society is impossible to tell. Tricking such a being should appear to be impossible, but my father and I noticed something.

Hidden underneath all the evidence of the beast’s existence and his deeds, there was a pattern. He was unstable. Despite all the knowledge and cunning he had, he often committed grievous mistakes, which seemed to pile up over the years. Did he lose his caution, as no one had been able to stop him yet? Or was something else occurring?

At this point in time, we couldn’t say, but we knew for certain that the beast wasn’t perfect. Take my family for example. As I have already mentioned, many of my ancestors didn’t enjoy a long life. Dedicating yourself to a war against the devil himself didn’t just promise a constant threat to your physical health but also to your psyche. While the beast laid waste to several members of my bloodline, many more couldn’t handle the truth and looming shadow of the adversary, taking solace in drugs or alcohol. Or mere severe measurements.

Why then didn’t the beast end my family? Why take the risk of anyone coming for you; no matter how slight the chances of one’s own loss? The answer is the beast tried. He had tried to kill every single one of my ancestors but failed to do so. Multiple times he came close, but always one member of my family escaped. Why not turn the tables and hunt the hunter? Because for some reason, the beast couldn’t.

Furthermore, the beast showed periods of inactivity. While measuring his actions proved near impossible, as often his influence was too faint to notice, we were able to map his deeds. Similar to his incompetence, his level of downtime was increasing. Did he need to rest more the further he aged? Questions over questions and there was only one way to answer them all.

My father and I took a great risk by going after the beast with such lacking intel, but both of us were keen to end the hunt. It appeared we didn’t just inherit the responsibility to stop the beast but also the tiredness of an entire bloodline, fighting for far too long. So, after months of observation and stalking, we were able to find him.

With the difficult part done, we went for the near-impossible one. Catching him. You see, Father didn’t just want to assassinate the beast, he wanted to capture him. The family records show that the beast isn’t someone to be trifled with, but he doesn’t seem to be unkillable. Ageless yes, but not immortal. This being said this doesn’t mean he would die as easily as a human being would.

One of my ancestors for example shot the beast six times in the chest. The bullets drove him to death’s door, but he succeeded in escaping justice despite his injuries. This showed us that we couldn’t believe normal measures to be sufficient to accomplish the deed. But perhaps it would have been. We were certain the beast was weakened, so maybe a well-timed bullet to the head would have been all it needed.

But no, father wasn’t willing to take any more risks. So, we decided to capture him and to take our time ending him. To accomplish this, we started to poison him. Small doses at first, nothing that should alarm him. We wanted to test out whether it would numb him enough to seize him.

One of the training fields which I had to master was deception and disguise but fooling the fools’ lord was impossible. Once alarmed, the beast would vanish, and it would take decades to find him again. So, we couldn’t come into direct contact with him, but with the people around him.

The coffee shops the beast loved to visit, his workplace, and his favorite restaurant. The beast is a creature of habit, and we had his schedule mapped out. We knew when he wasn’t nearby, so we could infiltrate his surroundings to place our drugs and poisons. And within days, our plan proved itself successful.

The beast appeared sick, barely able to keep his eyes open. His workplace ordered him to stay put at home and only return once cured. Dear reader, you might question our strategy. How could a being such as the beast ever fall sick? Wouldn’t such a creature be immune against all mortal illnesses?

The short answer is no. The beast’s body had been ravaged by the plague three different times. This allowed some of my ancestors and other hunters to find and fight him. But no matter the infliction, he persevered, but he suffered, nonetheless. And, more importantly, he was afraid for his life.

The beast did as he was told and remained at his home. On the third day, he went out to do some shopping. He had no one in his life to do this for him, fitting for a being of his nature. This was when we ambushed him. My father lured him next to our van by asking for directions. I told you, dear reader, I fear that the beast can look into the human heart and read it like a book. He should have noticed our intentions immediately right away. At that point in time, I thought the sickness was hindering his observation skills. Furthermore, I thought the beast believed himself safe, having forgotten all his caution.

Father distracted him for a few moments, so I could sneak out of the van. It happened within moments. The beast described which direction my father should take to reach his destination as I flung my arm around his neck and injected him with a mixture of drugs strong enough to knock out a horse. He was struggling underneath my hold, and I noticed his inhuman strength. If he hadn’t been weakened before, he could free himself with ease. As the mixture began to spread, I dragged him into the van. Once I closed the door, he had lost consciousness.

We brought him to our home and locked him up in our basement. Our house was reinforced and prepared for a direct assault of the beast. But also, to keep it there if the opportunity should open itself up to us. We bound him to a chair with locks of steel inside a cage. There were no windows, and the only door could take a rocket blast. Just for good measure.

I don’t know how long we watched his unconscious body. The arch enemy of not just our family but our very species trapped in front of us. Quite the sight to behold. Or so it should have been. I knew the beast looked like a common man, but you expect to see something in him. Some minute detail he got wrong. Something that would mark him as the devil. But no, he looked like someone ordinary. A bit disappointing.

He stirred after a few hours. He took in his surroundings, and the realization of his situation dawned on him. The lord of fools could act like no one. He begged. He sobbed. Screams for help. The beast fought against his restraints, roaring to be freed. My chest tightened at his performance. If I had been a lesser man, I would have believed him.

Father wasn’t moved either. He took his seat in front of the beast and began his questioning. He wanted to learn more about him before killing him.

“What are you talking about, man?!” the beast cried. “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”

Every time the beast failed to answer, Father hit him. Strong from the beginning, but his punches lacked the ferocity I knew my father to be capable of. That changed within an hour. Blood littered the floor accompanied by several teeth. It was a difficult thing to watch. The never-ending cries and my father’s wrath.

“Show yourself, devil!” my father screamed. He seized the beast by his hair, wet with sweat and blood. “Your lies won’t convince anyone!”

The beast’s face was swollen. His eyes were shut, and his nose was broken several times; any resemblance of a human appearance was beaten out of his features. My father collapsed in his chair, panting. He had kept himself in peak condition. He could run any marathon with ease and his punches could crack a human skull with just one hit. That the beast had survived his barrage for hours by this point proved beyond a doubt that this wasn’t a man in front of me.

“Jonathan, do it,” Father said, wiping away the blood from his hands.

I took out the bag of tools we had prepared for this moment. I do not intend to describe what I did to the beast. My father took joy in his torment. That’s why I think we kept him for as long as possible. Not to learn anything, but to make him suffer. To force the devil to endure his own domain for once, share the fate of any poor sinner, doomed for eternity.

I didn’t enjoy it. Often, I had dreams of grandeur. Of me being the savior that would free humankind of their worst adversary. That I would make the beast experience true regret once I was finished with him. Reality was less spectacular. I tortured him. Every pain you could imagine, I drowned him in. Agony you couldn’t even begin to grasp. Even if you torment the devil himself, your hands will be soiled by sin that can’t be washed away. It shouldn’t. It should stick to you to remind yourself what you are capable of and willing to commit.

Three days. Three days the beast endured… no, three days I endured.

Up until this point, I had successfully disassociated myself from the situation and me. But as I was taking a break, cleaning myself, I started shaking. I couldn’t stand any more second in this.

“Just say it,” I said, turning towards the beast. “Just tell him what he wants to learn.”

The beast was covered in blood and wounds. I hadn’t left a single spot untouched. His flesh was burned, cut, crushed, and worse. How many bones I broke or limbs I destroyed, I don’t dare to ponder. His body was more composed of freshly made scars than anything else, burrowing deep, speaking of pain reaching down towards hell. Yet he hadn’t died.

The beast’s head hung low, twitching. He was muttering something to himself. I grabbed a knife for the chance he would try something and approached him. I had to step next to him to hear his weak whispers.

“I can’t…,” he said. “I can’t wake. Let me sleep. I can’t endure it…”

“Then confess!” I said. “Be truthful towards my father, and I promise your suffering will cease!”

The beast shook his head, tears falling. “It hurts… it hurts so much…”

Somehow, I knew he wasn’t speaking about the torture I put him through. “What do you mean? What is hurting you?”

“My head… it’s full. Please, I don’t want to wake…”

“What are you talking about, devil? Answer me?!”

“It hurts?!” the beast screamed. He jerked his head up, staring at me. I was startled, moving away from him. While his eyes had been shut swollen two days ago, his body had an unnatural capability to heal itself. Due to that, the swelling had receded, and I could see them. His right eye still had the light blue tone as when we captured him but not his left one. The iris was drenched in a dark that would devour you if you wouldn’t be careful with a hot crimson star in its midst. It burned. An inferno trapped inside his head, so intense it blinded me.

“It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!”

He didn’t stop screaming the same phrase again. He wanted to trash around, the bindings cutting into his flesh as they held him. He threw his head back, his chest rising and falling in violent interludes. Blood poured out of his left eye, red tears descending like a comet toward the ground. The look he gave me. No malice, no promise of revenge or carnage. Inside this trapped star of his, I saw no devil but a broken being, driven mad.

His wild stare pierced into me with the weight of too many lives. “Why did you wake me?! Why?!”

Like a savage monster, the beast rampaged against his chains. A rage born from something I couldn’t understand took hold of him. But neither my father nor me were the target of his ire. I think the world itself or perhaps something grander laid at the core of his wrath. Too big to seize or to rip apart. Without a direct perpetrator to take revenge against, the beast seemed to want to tear apart anything too close to it, blinded by his inner turmoil. Something needed to die to clench this lust of his.

Dear reader, I can’t begin to describe the dread filling my lungs with every breath I took, pushing out the air I would have needed. Standing in close approximation to the beast and his anger crippled my mind and body, forgetting how to perform the simplest of tasks. How do I move my legs? How do I blink? How do I breathe?

“It’s all your fault!” the beast spat at me. “All of you should go to hell! You should burn! All of you! Burn, you should! Burn!”

As his left eye turned towards me, I became the only thing it seemed to perceive in the whole world. Its inferno leaked out of it, and I swear, dear reader, I could feel the heat of it. It bit into me, threatening to burn away my flesh and soul alike. This little taste of it, of the agony that would await me, was all it took to make me run up the stairs and flee.

The next hours are nothing but a blur. I can recall taking my parents' car and driving until it had no fuel anymore. I left it abandoned on the street and made my way through a forest, dodging tree branches and other obstacles in my mad sprint. When I came to stop or why I don’t know.

All I remember was cowering against a massive rock, pushing my back into the moss growing on its surface. Like waking from a nightmare, I blinked at my surroundings, having to remind myself that whatever I thought to have gone through was over. That I was back in reality. Night was already on the rise, and I feared to have been lost in the forest. Thankfully, I hadn’t made it far into its green embrace and found my way out of it easily enough.

I walked all night, haunted by my own cowardice. Father would be infuriated. I would never hear the end of it. But this was nothing more than a passing thought. This cursed eye followed me like a wraith, digging its claws into my skull, refusing to let go. To find any refuge from its haunting presence, I replayed the strange rumblings of the beast. What had he meant?

I didn’t find an answer on my walk. My mind was in shambles. As the sun rose again, I had arrived at home, or what was left of it. At first glance, it didn’t seem of the ordinary. But once I noticed the bloody handprint on the open door, I knew what had happened. I stood there for a couple of minutes, licking over my dry lips.

Did I want to see my dead parents? Did I need to see their shredded corpses, their guts littered over the floor? I don’t know whether I ever truly loved my parents. Thinking of them in this regard appears alien to me. Why treat them in a way they never treated me? But as I stepped towards my old house, I could sense a tear making its way down my cheek. I felt relieved at its presence, living proof that I was still somewhat human.

It was the only one I shed for them. 

I won’t describe them to you. They deserve this much at least. Just let it be known, that they tried to fight.

The beast had broken free of his shackles probably shortly after I fled, ripped skin and flesh still sticking to the shattered steel. In a daze, I sat down in the very spot the beast had been trapped in. I didn’t care for the blood soiling my clothing. I had bigger things on my mind.

Did I feel hate for the beast? I can’t say for sure. The glimpse I received of him had disturbed my outlook on him. But, after pondering the last conversation I had with him, I came to understand who he really was. His fate.

And here we are, dear reader. We’ve reached the end of my story, but this little tale is not over yet. You might remember that I promised to unmask the beast. That is only partially true. You would be forgiven for calling me a liar. I didn’t do so with ill intent. Everything I ever committed, I ever partook in, was only for the betterment of humanity.

I believed killing the beast a great service to my species, one that would remain unknown to them all, who yet couldn’t live without my deeds. I wasn’t wrong, but my goals have somewhat shifted. And the reason for that is you, dear reader.

One of you is not who they believe they are. You are not a bad person. You didn’t choose to be born like that. I thought you were a devil. Perhaps you were once. I can’t say. But what I can say is that I think I understand your turmoil. No, his turmoil.

No mind was made to endure eternity. The weight of his memories is crushing him, aren’t they? When I had woken him, I had woken him to them. Had he really fed on our suffering, or had he lashed out against anything that had taken him out of his slumber?

Is that why he had manipulated? Why he had pushed for destruction, as it was the only act of revenge he’d had for this cruel world that had birthed him? I won’t forgive him. I don’t think anyone can. My speculations shouldn’t be misunderstood as me trying to absolve him of his sins. They are his crimes, but not yours. You are a victim, unknowingly at that. But he is the same. A victim, too, but also a perpetrator. A broken child and a savage beast.  

Dear reader, I know you are not aware of the true nature of your being. You are nothing more than a pleasant dream. A dream of normality. An ordinary life, free of the curse of eternity. But every dream will come to an end. The beast will lash out again, and I can’t let this happen. Too many people have died. This needs to end.

You might wonder, how I found you? How do I know you will be amongst the few to read these very lines? The answer is simple. I finally understand you. The reason my family and the others all had failed is because none had attempted to comprehend what they were hunting. The beast was never alone. You were always by his side, shielding him from his suffering. The beast had appeared unknowable. Something beyond human that we can’t ever truly predict. That only after decades of close reading we might hope to find his scent again.

But not me. Not anymore. Every step you take, every thought rushing through your mind, every tear you shed. Like an open book, you are to me now. You won’t see me coming. You won’t feel a thing. When you read this, you will think me either mad or this being nothing but a crude joke. And if you believe a single word I wrote, you won’t think yourself the beast. You will believe someone else to house the monster.

This is good. You will die convinced being human. This grace I will grant you. Why am I writing these words then? Why am I announcing my coming? It is not for my desire to tell my story or to warn you but for the beast inside. Despite being asleep, I believe him to be watching. To hear what you hear through a veil, a faint echo he can perceive.

I want him to know his suffering will end. And to you, dear reader, I am sorry. Sorry that it had to be you. May we all meet under a brighter sun. Somewhere free of curses.

And now, dear reader, it is time to say goodbye. For now.",1,1729843457.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

Ascaso Baby T Plus or Steel Duo PID Plus [€2000-3000],"Not the first time this has been asked but I have different requirement to others I guess. I have a Barista Pro and Niche Zero at the moment. I mostly make Espressos(americanos sometimes) during the week and cappuccinos in the weekend. My usage is not high volume so I rarely need to churn out 3+ milk drinks at once. I like the idea of thermoblock due to the fast heat up times thus Ascaso units. Based in Europe

[Baby T](https://preview.redd.it/8u480hobyuwd1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd37c35573d2b0a1198f75c8cd19c9f4192780d5)

Pros

Seems like an endgame for me  
Like the idea of plumbing in water and drip tray at some point  
Rortary pump. Less noise and vibration.  
No thumping noise when steaming due to boiler.  
Faster steaming will be nice even though not necessary for usage  
Better build quality?  
App, I like to mess with tech and more settings to control

Cons

Due to my low volume the 2.5L steam boiler will keep water in there a long time and not be recycled(?)  
Power usage seems wasteful to turn on the steam boiler to make Espressos, not necessary in theory but I have read in the Baby T, the brewing thermoblock works best when water is preheated.  
Longer startup time due to boiler.  
If it had a smaller boiler the Baby T would be a no brainer for me.  
Is it too much of a mchine for my limited usage, 1 coffee a day maybe during weekends(I have a coffee machine at work and my wife uses Miele Superautomatic) and a couple a day over weekends sometimes more.

[Steel Duo](https://preview.redd.it/ltl8f0qdyuwd1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc58a9b4e3440d70eee3a52c536da633fe7eeae7)

Pros

Seems more suited to my usage  
Faster heat up times.

Cons

Noise, vibration, vibration pump  
Can't be plumbed in  
Build quality?  
Will always be thinking should I have gotten the Baby T

One of the main drivers of the Baby T is also the halo effect. Hate to admit it but it is true. Baby T with a smaller boiler or a Steel Duo with a rotary pump would have made the decision either way easier. My heart wants the Baby T but in my mind, I think the Steel Duo should really be what I get. Thoughts.",1,1729843354.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1gbov4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gbov4r/how_to_choose_the_perfect_coffee_table_for_your/,How to Choose the Perfect Coffee Table for Your Living Room,"Choosing the perfect coffee table can elevate your living room's look and functionality. With so many styles, materials, and sizes to choose from, finding the ideal coffee table to complement your [living room furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture) can feel overwhelming. This guide will help you decide on the best coffee table based on your style, space, and lifestyle needs.

**1. Determine Your Living Room’s Style**

To seamlessly integrate your coffee table into your space, start by defining your living room style. Is your decor modern, rustic, minimalist, or classic? A glass or metal coffee table pairs beautifully with modern decor, adding a touch of elegance without overwhelming the space. For a more rustic or cozy look, opt for a wooden coffee table. If you have a minimalist or Scandinavian-inspired space, a coffee table with clean lines and a simple design will work best. By aligning your coffee table with the overall style of your living room furniture, you create a cohesive and harmonious aesthetic.

**2. Think About Functionality**

Consider how you use your living room on a daily basis. Do you need extra storage space? A coffee table with built-in shelves or drawers can store remotes, magazines, or board games, keeping clutter at bay. If you entertain frequently, look for a coffee table with a durable top surface that can handle snacks and drinks. For homes with small children, rounded edges can be safer than sharp corners, minimizing any potential hazards.

**3. Choose the Right Size and Shape**

When it comes to size, your coffee table should ideally be about two-thirds the length of your sofa and no taller than the height of the cushions. This ensures the table doesn’t overpower the space or appear too small. The shape of your coffee table can also make a big difference in how the room flows. Rectangular tables fit well in long, narrow spaces, while round or oval tables soften the lines in square or compact rooms. A round coffee table is ideal if you have an L-shaped sofa, as it allows easy movement around the seating arrangement.

**4. Consider Material and Durability**

The material of your coffee table should complement the other elements in the room. Wooden tables add warmth and texture, while metal or glass options give a sleek, modern look. When choosing a material, also think about durability. If you have pets or children, materials like tempered glass or solid wood tend to be more resilient to scratches and everyday wear. If you're aiming for a cozy aesthetic, consider a fabric or leather ottoman that doubles as a coffee table – it’s functional, comfortable, and softens the room's overall look.

**5. Add Matching Side Tables**

A coffee table can often look even better when complemented by [side tables for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/side-tables). Side tables provide additional surface space, which can be helpful when entertaining guests or adding table lamps for mood lighting. By choosing a side table for the living room that matches or complements your coffee table, you create a balanced look that ties the room together. 

**6. Experiment with Versatile Coffee Tables**

If your living room is a multi-functional space, look for versatile coffee tables that adapt to various uses. Some coffee tables come with lift-up tops, which can double as a work-from-home desk. Nesting coffee tables are also a great choice if you want flexibility – the smaller tables can be pulled out for extra surface area or tucked away to save space.

**Final Thoughts**

Your coffee table is more than just a piece of furniture; it’s the centerpiece of your living room and can significantly influence the ambiance and functionality of the space. By considering your living room's style, space, and needs, you can choose a coffee table that enhances both form and function. Whether you’re looking at sleek glass options, rustic wooden tables, or multi-functional pieces, remember that the perfect coffee table will not only look great but also serve your daily needs seamlessly.

Finding the ideal [coffee tables for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) spaces is about balancing aesthetics and practicality. With these tips, you’re ready to pick a piece that complements your living room furniture, makes a statement, and serves as a functional part of your home.",1,1729842152.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Like I don't get those happy endorphins from seeing my fiance of 14 years. 

If he hurts himself I feel nothing. 

I don't miss him when he's not home. 

I haven't been genuinely happy since primary school.

I don't care about anyone at all. If someone hurts themselves I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything when someone dies. 

Now having said all this, if my fiance is sick and needs me, an autistic adhd person to get hi meds from the pharmacy I'll do it. If he's stressed, I will make him a coffee and give him a cuddle. If he needs to vent, I'll listen.

Can anyone please help me identify whatever this is

I’m going to submerge the entire thing in boiling water then scrub it clean by opening the entire thing and deep clean through the screws and all 

Should I just throw it away cause is it harmful?
I’m feeling very very icky because I love using this for my coffee and I am just feeling yucky know there’s these tiny little things just worming around there
They’re inside the cup too😭😭

Can someone please help

My lease for my duplex stated that I I owed 50% of the utility bills, to be shared with the other tenants.  The utility bills were in the landlord’s name. I asked the landlord what I owed for utilities multiple times the first few months I lived there.  I finally asked the other tenants about it and they said they had lived there for 2+ years and he had never provided them with a bill or asked them to pay.  So I stopped asking my landlord about it. I lived there for 2 years.  @ 20 days after moving out I texted him asking when he was going to return my deposit.  On the 21st day sent me a chicken scratch note listing lump sums for 2years of water, gas, and electricity charges totally more than my $9,000 deposit and said I owed him $2k+ in addition to the $9k he kept.  There were no receipts or utility statements, just hand written sums.  I sent him a certified letter stating that I wanted my deposit back and the reasons why.  I the filed my small claims case.

Also check out my other post if you live in your car to help prioritize and help you know you’re not alone… 

*Update* For food on my previous post.
My new strategy to get fit and eat well homeless… 

Find away to find microwavable 1 serving packs of rice… for my protein Tuna is perfect for me. 
(I know lots of people who don’t like it… ) 

Walmart sells these tuna packets so you don’t need a can opener. 

And get a supplement for green to make sure you’re getting your vitamins from natural greens or if needed a vitamin . I use one a day for men from Costco. I’m sure there are other places that sell it. 

A few days ago , I used up all my money… so my next 5 days are gonna be hard for food till my next check. Remember that as humans you don’t need much food to live we can go a long time without food before we hit the can so it’s a mental game. 

Distract yourself with activity that are light and journal your thoughts… and if you can hangout with buddies to pass the time so it. 

& Hydrate!!!! 

You can buy instant coffee that you can keep in the car and put a small scoop in a water bottle and drink it… it’s gonna be gross but you’ll have some energy to get through the day and the coffee will help situate your hunger… 

Just take this example if you relate then you do.. 

I use to be a heavy gamer, Apex, Rainbow, Valorant, War Zone, Realm of the Mad God, Warframe etc… I could game for 8-10 hours with just water and be fine but it’s when your mind isn’t preoccupied it will focus on the things it needs lol like eating. 🤣 but it doesn’t really matter… 

Fasting is good for you so it’s a blessing in disguise. Helps detox your body and just helps regulate hormones… 

Just know you got this and just be patient with yourself…especially if your the only you got!!! You are learning to be an adult and that managing life on your own… so take it one W or L at a time and learn from your actions… always striving to improve your life even if it cost a bit of money.. health and mental wellbeing over anything else. 

Have a good night I’m done with the gym did 6 laps total back and forth so basically 3 laps but 6 sounds a bit  better 💪🏽🫰🏼🤣

Married for less that 3 months. 

We have a 7 month old. She’s off on maternity and I work 5 days a week. 

I pay all bills, cover all food expenses, cover all dog expenses, cover all car expenses. Also send her money each month as maternity pay is bum. 

However, the house is a shit tip. She uses the excuse she doesn’t get time with the baby but when I have the baby on the weekend it’s easy to simply put her down if she’s asleep and get something done. Or even stick her in the high chair with some toys in the same room and just sing to her etc while you sort stuff out. I’ve told her to do that and now I’m in a position where the house is worse and no washing has been done. 

It’s frustrating because yeah it was difficult to get anything done in the early stages but now there’s no excuse when she’s happy to play with toys and sleep lying down one she’s away. 

She still manages to go for coffee with her friends every week, goes to baby groups or takes the baby out shopping. So she’s literally just avoiding the situation. 

Last thing I want to do being out of the house since 7AM and getting in at 6PM is clean up after the pair of them (more so the wife) as I want time with the baby. Once I get the baby I say why don’t you get stuff done around the house for an hour while I’ve got her. 

That’s met with “it’s been a hard day” or “I just want some down time”. Which I can get obviously it must be exhausting but when there’s bins left in the house, dirty nappies left everywhere and no washing done for anyone for a week. It’s giving lazy and disgusting.

I’m at my wits and with it and I’m thinking of leaving for a week or two with the baby just to let her understand that there’s no excuse. 

Not really sure how to navigate this without being mean since I’ve basically asked her a few times politely now to sort it. 

TL;DR: wife doesn’t clean up despite having enough time to do it while I work 5 days a week l. I pay for everything but she can’t even do the washing. Raised it a few times and she doesn’t get the message how to do it nicely?",1,1729840991.0,relationship_advice,11,0.67,False

2. **Importing Countries:** Where can I find reliable data on the top countries that import Indian coffee?
3. **Profit Margins:** Anyone experienced in coffee exports who can shed some light on potential profit margins? I’d love to understand if it’s worth the investment.
4. **Export Tips:** Any advice for a new exporter – pitfalls to avoid, licenses, or certifications that could help with international compliance?
5. **Product Alternatives:** If coffee isn’t the most viable option, are there any other trending export products that you think have a strong demand right now?

Got the pass this Wednesday, which is quite the welcome surprise because I tested on 10/10, and was expecting the results much, much later.
So when that scheduling permit disappeared, it got me really, really excited.
It comes as a huge relief - after months of toiling and meeting personal deadlines, the path is laid and fate a lil bit clearer.
It was a topsy turvy journey, embroiled with financial difficulties, parental health problems, and mental fatigue. The process as a whole merits a huge tax on the mind, and there were definitely days where I couldn’t meet my personal targets, and there were times that just made me wish I could tap out. For anyone on the same boat, hang in there and give it your best :)

**Test Day**
Couldn’t get a proper night’s sleep with all the adrenaline in my system, so I had to have a big, strong cup of coffee before entering the testing area. 
The questions on the real deal are definitely more relative to the free 120, rather than being the ‘gotcha’ type you see on UW, or as straightforward as NBME ones. As for the STEMs, they’re somewhere in between too, but manageable. For every long ass paragraph you read, there’s bound to be a question that’s pretty straightforward- so don’t worry.
Lots of ethics questions, sometimes felt like a hit and miss. The exam really cvs and renal intensive tho.
A can of red bull really saved my ass on the last couple blocks.
I felt like the exam went so-so, and i was just glad that it was over.


With that being said, I’ll go over the strategy that is used to tackle the exam.

**My Strategy**
I started my prep from May 2024, with my primary resources being First aid and Uworld. I really wanted to shore up my basics and create a sort of platform in understanding concepts - so I used BnB before starting a system.
It went like : BnB of a particular system, say neuro(1-2days)—-> Uworld questions of the system(around 60/day)
Reviewing the questions have to be pretty extensive, it really doesn’t matter if you got it right or wrong. Make sure you annotate and write anything you feel is important in your First Aid, as it will be pretty damn helpful later.
I finished with a 67% in my first and only pass on Uworld, and took about 3 months to do it all.
After my first few systems, I realised that it was pretty important to integrate a whole lot more systems in the blocks I was doing. So, i would intentionally leave around 50-60 questions of each system before starting the next one, so that I could create mixed blocks in the future.
I saved stuff like genetics and biochemistry towards the end of my prep. Dirty medicine is gold for biochemistry, no kidding.

In the last 1-1.5 months, I started with my dedicated testing phase
NBME 27- 75%, UWSA1- 228(69%), NBME 28- 78%, NBME 29- 83%, NBME 30- 82%, UWSA 2- 247, NBME 31- 81%, Free 120- 78%
I tried to solve the Amboss high yield 200, but couldn’t get thru them all. I revised my FA, and reviewed my NBMEs, and read up Mehlman HY arrows, neuroanatomy. Reading the high yield points (19-20 pages at the end of FA), really helped a lot.
Booked the exam 30 days before, right after my UWSA1. I do recall feeling pretty shit after my free120 - the second block humbled me. I definitely didn’t want to end up like India at WC23’, lmao.

**What would I have done differently?**
Starting Mehlman pdfs earlier - never got the chance to do the HY review, or the Risk factors- which I strongly recommend as it is tested extensively. Risk factors are also easy to go wrong with, and Mehlman gives to an entire pdf instead of having to comb through FA trying to find the details.
I couldn’t find time to do Anki decks throughout my day during prep, and the couple of times I did, i found it vv helpful. For those who want a break from the regular Anking, or Zanki- try the Mnemosyne deck, it’s pretty good.

I’m an IMG from India- there were a lot of question marks related to my journey. Im glad that the first step on the path has been completed.
If you ever think about the difficultly of the exam, I saw this on reddit a while back(has been my all is well mantra since then)- USMLE gives you the Question *and the answer* amongst the options. All you have to do is choose it. It’s that easy!! XD

I'll go into more detail if we chat, but I've lived with a disability since the age of 20 that has severely impacted my mobility and independence. I've always been painfully introverted, so while my friends all eventually moved on to start their lives, I withdrew and became socially isolated. I've dealt with, and still deal with, depression and anxiety. At some point I just accepted that that's how life would be.

  
But now there's a little light at the end of the tunnel. Some things I'll never be able to do again, but new meds and new treatments have already given me a lot of my mobility back. I still have a long, long way to go, but independence is like a real goal now. It's also made me realize just how isolated I really am, and how little human contact I've had over the last 17 years.

'' You think so? '' She'd say as she smiled back, taking a sip of her coffee.

inner dialogue: *Seriously?? what does he think he's doing.*

In a heartwarming tale of modern enlightenment, local man Dave Thompson has discovered a newfound ability to identify injustice in everyday life—and he couldn’t be more excited! However, this enthusiasm has led to a rather unexpected side effect: Dave is now offended by absolutely everything.

“I always thought I was a pretty good guy,” Dave declared from his favorite artisanal coffee shop, where he was busy crafting a lengthy Twitter thread about systemic oppression. “But once I learned how to spot racism, it was like I was given a superpower! Suddenly, I see it everywhere!”

This newfound sensitivity has transformed Dave’s life in ways he never anticipated. Simple activities like grocery shopping or watching TV have become an endless source of outrage. “I can’t believe they put a white guy in the lead role of that movie!” he exclaimed, shaking his head in disbelief. “How is that not offensive?”

Friends and family have noticed the change. “At first, we thought it was great that he was becoming more aware,” said his girlfriend, Lisa. “But now, he gets offended if someone doesn’t recycle properly or if the waiter calls him ‘sir’ instead of ‘person of privilege.’ It’s exhausting!”

Dave’s social media accounts have transformed into a never-ending stream of indignation. “Every time I scroll, I find something new to be outraged about,” he said, his eyes gleaming with excitement. “Did you know that some people still use the term ‘whiteboard’? I mean, come on! What about the feelings of all those colorful markers?”

Friends have dubbed Dave’s new hobby the “Offense Olympics,” where he competes for the gold medal in finding the most ridiculous reasons to be offended. “Yesterday, he got upset because a local bakery had a ‘Choco-Latte’ special,” shared his friend Mark. “He insisted it was cultural appropriation of both coffee and chocolate. I mean, who knew pastries could be so problematic?”

In his quest for inclusivity, Dave has taken to correcting strangers in public. “I saw someone wearing a sombrero at a party, and I just had to say something,” he recounted proudly. “I told them they were perpetuating stereotypes. They looked confused, but I felt like a hero!”

Experts are divided on whether this behavior is ultimately beneficial or counterproductive. “On one hand, it’s great that people are becoming more aware of social issues,” said sociology professor Dr. Jane Equality. “But on the other hand, if everyone is constantly offended, it undermines genuine conversations about racism and inequality.”

As Dave continues to navigate his newfound sensitivity, he remains committed to finding offense in every corner of his life. “I just want to make the world a better place,” he said, sipping his oat milk latte. “One complaint at a time.” 

In the meantime, he’s already planning to attend a workshop on how to be offended by jokes about kale—because if there’s one thing he knows, it’s that nothing is too trivial to be taken seriously.",1,1729839264.0,babylonbee,0,0.6,False

We have a 3 month old and since week 7 he's been on the bottle because I just didn't really produce enough milk (despite lactation consultant help and everything). I keep pumping, as my ""I failed as a breastfeeding mum"" guilt makes me feel I should, but genuinely this kid gets like 45ml every two days, if that... my partner recently asked if it was worth it, because it's 3-5 pumping sessions of 20 minutes a pop, and this kid pretty much only naps in the sling when we wear him so it makes it extremely difficult to pump at all. Not to mention, I still don't drink coffee or alcohol just to be 'safe' about it. Partner is very supportive, just doesn't want me to put undue pressure on myself if the gains are so minimal for the little dude while the effort is so great on my part.

So here's the question: is it actually worth it? And what's the better option -- giving him 10-15ml every day, or waiting until I have 50ml (which can take up to 3 days) to give him the full 50ml, because every website throws around this magical 50ml number... Or am I putting more pressure on myself for very little gains?

TL;DR: is it worth it to keep pumping to give your kid 50ml every three days of breastmilk? And if yes, is it better to give them 10-15ml per day that you pump or wait until you have a full 50ml to give to them in one go?

When it comes to designing a house in Los Angeles, you have the unique opportunity to bring all these elements together, crafting a home that is as stylish and vibrant as the city itself. Whether you want to capture the calm of the beach, the boldness of the hills, or the chic vibes of urban areas, house design in Los Angeles is a celebration of individuality and sophistication.

The architecture in LA is a beautiful kaleidoscope of modern styles, ranging from mid-century masterpieces to Mediterranean-inspired villas. Creating a house in this wonderful city isn’t just about choosing walls and roofs – it’s about building a space where your life’s most cherished moments will unfold. With breathtaking natural beauty surrounding every neighborhood, from mountains to ocean views, there’s an opportunity to build an oasis that celebrates all that Los Angeles has to offer.

So, whether you’re thinking about a sprawling residence on the hills, a compact bungalow in a bustling neighborhood, or a luxurious villa by the beach, this guide will walk you through the many exciting aspects of designing your perfect home in Los Angeles. With careful planning and some creative flair, you can create a dream house that seamlessly blends indoor and outdoor living – one that’s in harmony with the city’s natural beauty and urban charm.

# The Heart of House Design Los Angeles: Lifestyle at the Core

House design in Los Angeles is all about lifestyle. In this city, how you live is just as important as where you live. One of the most crucial steps in designing a home here is to focus on maximizing comfort while taking full advantage of the beautiful year-round climate. You want your home to feel as if it's a natural extension of the landscape, where sliding glass doors and open patios make the boundary between the inside and outside almost invisible.

From lush gardens to rooftop terraces with sweeping views, creating spaces that enhance your connection with nature is key. Picture a living room that opens out to a garden oasis, or a cozy indoor space seamlessly flowing into an outdoor dining area with a stunning view of the cityscape. The beauty of house design in Los Angeles is that every detail can be tailored to fit your lifestyle perfectly, creating spaces that make every day feel like a luxurious escape.

Another important feature of house design in Los Angeles is the focus on sustainability. Many modern homes are designed with eco-friendly materials, efficient energy systems, and a variety of other green technologies. Solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and smart home technologies are not just buzzwords – they are becoming the standard when it comes to creating houses in LA. Sustainable features help reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to a greener future, all while giving you a sense of purpose and a home that embodies forward-thinking design.

# Designing for Personal Expression: Infusing Your Style

When creating a house in Los Angeles, the possibilities are endless, and the most exciting part is making your space truly your own. Do you dream of a sleek minimalist look, an eclectic bohemian retreat, or a cozy modern farmhouse with character and warmth? Whatever your vision, house design in Los Angeles allows you to combine the best of global design trends with your personal tastes to create something unique.

In the fourth paragraph of this article, let's emphasize that house design Los Angeles is a direct reflection of individuality and personality. Homeowners here love pushing boundaries, blending architectural styles, and adding bespoke details that make their homes one-of-a-kind. Interior decor is where you can express your personality the most—vibrant colors, sophisticated art pieces, custom furniture, and curated accents are all used to create a visual story that speaks of your life and values.

Working with the right materials and using natural elements is another wonderful way to give your house that perfect Los Angeles touch. From wooden beams that evoke a mid-century modern vibe to airy, open rooms filled with natural light, it's all about creating an inviting, comfortable space. Thoughtful color palettes, unique textures, and beautiful, handcrafted features ensure your house isn’t just another building—it's a true reflection of you.

# Bringing the Outdoors In: The Essence of Los Angeles Living

Los Angeles is blessed with a wonderful climate that encourages an indoor-outdoor lifestyle all year round. Whether your home is near the coastline or nestled in a peaceful suburban area, connecting your interior living spaces with nature is a key design element. By incorporating glass walls, French doors, or sliding panels that open wide, you can blur the lines between the indoors and outdoors, turning your garden, patio, or courtyard into a natural extension of your living space.

Imagine mornings where you sip your coffee while gazing at a garden filled with succulents, or evenings spent relaxing under the stars without ever leaving your living room. Designing a seamless connection between inside and outside brings a unique charm that few other cities can match. Adding shaded outdoor nooks, pools, and garden seating areas creates a perfect balance, allowing your home to be as inviting on the outside as it is on the inside.

In Los Angeles, light is also a big part of the design conversation. The city is known for its sun-soaked days, and it's essential to make use of natural light when planning the layout of your home. Large windows, skylights, and open spaces make every corner feel bright, cheerful, and vibrant. Thoughtful positioning of the house itself can also enhance the natural light, allowing rooms to bathe in sunlight for most of the day. It's no surprise that many LA homes take advantage of floor-to-ceiling windows, creating an effortless flow between rooms that fills every space with an abundance of light.

# Features that Define LA Homes: Elements that Capture the Spirit of Los Angeles

Every city has a unique spirit, and when it comes to house design, Los Angeles offers more than just four walls and a roof—it's a lifestyle. The best Los Angeles homes are designed with attention to the little details that make daily life both functional and extraordinary. Many luxury homes in LA are known for having amenities like infinity pools, rooftop decks, and state-of-the-art home theaters, but even smaller, more accessible homes in Los Angeles can include thoughtful features that elevate everyday experiences.

Incorporating smart technology is another essential aspect of designing a modern Los Angeles home. Features such as automated lighting, temperature controls, security systems, and integrated sound systems can all add ease and comfort to your home, making it more functional and enjoyable to live in. A Los Angeles house isn’t just a place to live—it’s a place to enjoy every moment of your life.

Another exciting part of house design in Los Angeles is the attention paid to the outdoor spaces. Whether it's creating a backyard haven, a garden filled with native Californian plants, or a small balcony with succulents and fairy lights, having an outdoor area that reflects your style is a key element in a Los Angeles home. The integration of water features, native plants, fire pits, and cozy seating areas can transform an ordinary outdoor space into a peaceful retreat for family and friends.

# The Neighborhood Influence: Finding Inspiration from Los Angeles' Diverse Districts

Los Angeles is an incredibly diverse city, both in terms of culture and geography. This diversity is reflected in its neighborhoods, each offering a unique vibe that can inspire the design of your home. Are you inspired by the bohemian flair of Venice Beach, or do you lean towards the sophisticated charm of Beverly Hills? Maybe you prefer the laid-back artistic vibe of Silver Lake or the historical elegance of Hancock Park?

Drawing inspiration from your favorite neighborhood can help define your house design. For instance, a Malibu-inspired home might feature plenty of natural materials, large windows, and a focus on ocean views and relaxed living. On the other hand, a Hollywood Hills-inspired design could emphasize luxury, with high ceilings, panoramic views, and exquisite details that make your home feel like a secluded paradise.

The beauty of Los Angeles house design lies in the fact that you can take the essence of your neighborhood and transform it into something that fits your personality and needs. Whether it's through architecture, landscaping, or interior decor, the neighborhoods of LA offer a wealth of inspiration to help you create a home that resonates with the spirit of this vibrant city.

# Designing for the Future: Sustainability and Smart Living

As the world becomes more conscious of environmental issues, the way we design and build our homes is evolving. In Los Angeles, sustainability isn’t just an option—it’s increasingly becoming a fundamental part of house design. From energy-efficient appliances to solar panel installations, eco-friendly materials, and intelligent landscaping that conserves water, there are endless opportunities to make your house more sustainable.

The concept of smart living is also taking center stage. Los Angeles homeowners are embracing innovative technologies that make their homes more comfortable and energy-efficient. Imagine waking up and, with the push of a button, the blinds open to let in the morning light, your coffee begins brewing, and your favorite playlist fills the air. Smart homes offer both luxury and convenience, making everyday living a pleasure.

Embracing these sustainable and smart living solutions allows you to create a space that is not only beautiful and functional but also forward-thinking. This is especially important in Los Angeles, a city that often sets trends for the rest of the country when it comes to innovation and design. By integrating these technologies, you can create a home that is ready for the future and perfectly suited to your lifestyle.

# Creating Your Dream Home: Making It Happen

The prospect of designing a house in Los Angeles can be thrilling. With the right team and a clear vision, you can bring your ideas to life and create a space that perfectly reflects who you are. Whether you're working with architects, interior designers, or contractors, the process should be a collaborative one, with your tastes and needs leading the way.

Every detail matters, from the layout and structure to the smallest touches that make your home uniquely yours. It's about creating a house that isn't just a building, but a true reflection of your identity, designed to grow with you and adapt to your changing needs. The journey to designing your dream home in Los Angeles might require time and dedication, but the reward is a beautiful, comfortable sanctuary that is uniquely yours.

In Los Angeles, a city known for its creativity, diversity, and unique way of life, designing a home is a chance to build something extraordinary. With an eye toward modern luxury, a commitment to sustainability, and a deep understanding of your lifestyle and needs, you can create a house that isn’t just a place to live, but a space where every day is a celebration of beauty, comfort, and joy.",1,1729838298.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

1gbnyee,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1gbnyee/conscious_habit_forming_from_a_spiritual/,Conscious Habit Forming From a Spiritual Perspective,"New habits are merely the repetition of thought patterns and actions.

These determine the quality of our daily lives and shape our personalities. These habits decide whether we grow or stagnate, so we must consciously shape them to ensure our growth.

You are capable of acting, and you are doing something right now. You act all day, 24/7. You are always in some state. You always think about something; you are always in some mental or emotional state.

These thought patterns and actions can repeat over days, weeks, and years. Those that persist over many days become habits. You might even do them at the same time each day.

Perhaps you drink a coffee every morning, take a walk, check social media, or read the news. Every evening you take a bath and brush your teeth. When your partner makes you angry, you yell at them. When you go out, you always style your hair in a particular way. You eat your food quickly.

When people see you, you think you must look awkward. When you look at the calendar and see it's Monday, you get a stomachache and think your life is like that of a slave. When you see a delicious dessert or alcohol, you already feel like you're consuming it and feeling good. When someone criticizes you, you immediately retort with something to mock them or find logical flaws—or you start criticizing yourself, agreeing that you're not good enough.

There are countless habits that make up your life.

So when we talk about a new habit, we are actually talking about transforming an existing habit into a new one. There is no space for a new one, as there is always some habit that is active. Thus, it is not about adding something new but about transformation and change.

Your goal is to transform. You must clearly think thoughts and repeatedly take actions that build you up.

Actions that make your life better, easier, and more beautiful. They color in the painful desires and limitations of the human body and the gray, superficial aspects of society, turning them into a playful dream while you are free physically, mentally, and financially.

So you actually want heaven. I just described it.

Heavenly joy is when you are sincerely grateful even when you appear to be unfortunate. When you see beauty in filth. Order in chaos. Love in hatred. Depth beneath the surface. Meaning in the message.

And infinity within yourself.

After all, you do not know where you came from or where you are going. You don't even know exactly what you thought before or what you will think in the future—or even what you think right now.

Something creates this for you, and you experience it. After all, you are not doing it; you do nothing. Something continues constantly, again and again, never stopping, never dying.

How long will it go on? We do not know its past or future. We may assume it is temporary and began when we were born and ends when we die. But something birthed us, and something takes us to death.

So we are not alone; there is something else beyond us that created us and carries us forward. This something must be beyond life and death, beginning and end, as it transcends them.

We experience what this something does. We are the observers. If we observe, then it does not happen to us but only to that which we observe.

Thus, we are not limited by what we observe. We are beyond it. We only see its limitations—the limitations of the body and mind. We experience what these are like. But they are not us.

We are drawn to what is not human, what is beyond us. We do not like illness or decay. We fear aging, fear death, fear the unknown future. We are not used to limitation. It is new to us, foreign, frightening.

For it is temporary, and we are not. We are frightened because we believe we are not merely the observers of the temporary. We experience it as if it were the ultimate truth—that we are limited, weak, powerless, temporary.

The goal is to bring what is beyond—what is eternal and infinite—inside.

To see infinity in earthly decay. Rebirth in death, healing in pain, creation in destruction, warmth in cold, satisfaction in desire, learning in suffering, and lessons in misfortune.

The goal is heaven. Creating heaven with your current tools, in your current state, in your current situation. To reach heaven by experiencing here what you would experience elsewhere. To experience boundlessness, strength, beauty, ease, and playfulness here.

How each person reaches this depends on them. But we all long for it. For heavenly states. That is why we desire peace, love the concept of infinite energy, speed, strength, boundlessness, and beauty. Because they are all characteristics of heaven. Everything that is beautiful and that our soul is drawn to is there.

The difficulty is that human existence often seems like the opposite of heaven.

False, superficial desires and pleasures, and the dissatisfaction, craving, and depression that follow them. The trap of society is that it promises heavenly pleasures, but what it provides is an earthly pleasure.

Earthly pleasure is fleeting and superficial. It is not eternal. It is not infinite. It fades, runs out, ends. And afterward, you crave it again, even more. You can hardly think of anything else—you want it again.

It takes control over your body and your thoughts. You become addicted to earthly, superficial pleasures. And they give you nothing in the long term. Nothing remains.

They are made of sand, blown away by the wind. They decompose, decay.

The eternal, heavenly pleasure, however, is yours and is with you everywhere. It is something within you. It does not fade because it does not belong to your body or your environment.

It belongs to your understanding. To your reason. So even if your body hurts, even if you have no money, even if you are alone... You are still okay, because you have knowledge that is infinite and not transient.

The body, money, and human relationships are transient. So if you base your happiness on them, your happiness will be fragile. It can break at any moment, turning into disappointment, pain, suffering, and lack.

The goal is for your thought patterns to reflect heavenly pleasures. To see strength in your weakness, lessons in your pain, wealth in your poverty, blessings in accidents.

If you recognize this, then you will live in heaven, as good things will always happen to you. Nothing can happen to you that does not build, heal, sustain, energize, or delight you.

Heaven exists in your mind. You can see it; it is not hidden from you, not closed off. It is accessible, infinite, and all yours.

But it depends on you what you accept from it.

Many are addicted to human, earthly, superficial pleasures. It is hard to let go of superficial pleasures and beliefs because they seem to bring happiness and security.

Those who cannot see or create security for themselves will run away.

They flee, afraid, because they are alone, do not know what to do, panic. That is why they seek refuge—which society gladly provides in the form of superficial poison.

With superficial pleasure, everything seems fine in life. No shame, no pain, no limitations, no weakness.

Of course, this is not true. The reality in which you see these things still exists. It just passed. You just put it aside. Instead, you see a false security. And you get used to always running away and reaching for superficial pleasure. This became your habit. That is why you never felt the need to learn to create security, peace, and beauty for yourself. It was never necessary, and you never learned how.

That is why you became addicted to earthly, superficial pleasures. Cigarettes, drama, TikTok, self-help books, sugar, spicy food, changing intimate partners, shopping, complaining, videogames and so on.

These do not give you peace, tranquility, joy, or gratitude. They fade, end, and you are back where you started. You do not grow from them. Nothing good happens to you. In fact, your habit of turning to them grows stronger, and you become less and less able to energize yourself. You want life less and less because it becomes harder and harder to be happy on your own.

That is why you need heavenly, infinite pleasures, which also exist on earth—you just need to see them and accept them.

To do this, you must recognize what is eternal and what is temporary. Otherwise, you will confuse them.

You need to rewrite your perception, worldview, and your subconscious mind. So it will help you see the positive aspects in everything that might otherwise drain your energy.

This way, the knowledge will not only be yours but the practice as well. You will not only recognize the apple of knowledge but also eat it and taste its flavor.

**Chikí:** \*knocking at my door but not entering\* ***Mija?*** **are you ok? you been your room since last night. you didn't even eat dinner with us. Not even for a cup of** ***café, te ese una tasa.*** **Can you please come out? {I've made you a cup}**

**Me:** \*talking from the other side, not in the mood\* **Not now Chikí, I'm not in the mood to talk. Not even for coffee.** 

**Chikí:** ***Prima,*** **I've taken a few weeks off from to hang out to only find you crying over some** ***esey?!*** 

**Me:** ***Prima, por favor!*** **I'm not crying! I'm just....**

**Chikí: Just what?** 

**Me: I don't want to about this in front of your** ***niños okey.*** **{kids okay}** **(""okay"" is spelled with an e in Latin America)**

**Chikí: Oh! they're not home, they're with their** ***Abuelita {granny},*** **you know** ***tu Tía. {your aunt}*** **Please, come out, I want to talk.** 

I noted that I've taken a very deep breath and step outside to see my cousin holding a tray with two cups of coffee and some *pan dulce*. That means she's worried. 

**Me: Ok, what do you want to talk about?**

**Chikí: I saw you yesterday looking like you were wanting to cry. I want to know if my** ***prima*** **is** ***okey.*** 

**Me: Chikí, I'm not ok. I'm so pissed off and betrayed. I was dragged into something like a** ***perro y su juguete!*** **{dog and his toy}** 

**Chikí: you want me to have ""talk"" with him?**

**Me: NO CHIKÍ! you barely missed the cops that one time. Plus I don't want you to lose your job at the factory.** 

**Chikí: I'm kidding....kinda. come on** ***prima*** **lets sit at the coffee table and talk this out.** 

I follow her to the living and told everything, everything I've told you guys. She knows about my past trauma and she's one of the first ones I've told and to say that my cousin was pissed off would be an understatement. 

**Chikí: IMMA PUT THAT** ***PUTO*** **IN THE DIRT!** ***ESE HIJO DE PUTA NO ME VA VER SU PRIMER BODA-*** **{asshole} {That son of a bitch will not see his first wedding-}** 

**Me:** ***Prima*** **stop! There's no point.** 

**Chikí:** ***PERO ESE PUTO*** **JUST REVEALED SOMETHING HORRIBLE! HOMIES DON'T MESS WITH HOMIES! {but that bitch} (""puto"" has different meanings when translating to English)**  

You can take a chica out from East-LA but you can't take East-LA out from a chica. 

**Me: Chikí, the point I'm trying to make is that ""*****puto*****"" is a good friend of mine.**

**Chikí: You mean WAS a good friend. Come on** ***prima*****, a friend will understand if you can't help them with their shit! I know homies help homies but sometimes when a homie fucks up, that** ***güey*** **is on his own! Especially when the five-o on his ass.** 

**Me: Cops are not involved!**

**Chikí: The five-o is the bitch who started the club** ***idiota!*** **God, is like you don't understand Metaphor or something. Look, you have two options. ONE, is putting your foot down and face the fact your ""friend"" dragged you for no reason and broke your trust. Or secondly, let him continue fucking you in the ass.** 

**Me: CHIKÍ! HE'S NOT FUCKING ME OVER!**

**Chikí: bullshit! He's fucking you worst then a chomo on his first day in prison. Why can't you see that? He's using you as a shield.** 

**Me: I mean.....maybe I just-**

**Chikí: Can't believe it?**

**Me: Yeah.....maybe I AM an idiot. I couldn't just told him no but I guess I couldn't shake off the feeling he just told my past to a guy who's a god-damn creep.** 

**Chikí: Future chomo from the looks of it.** 

**Me: Chikí please, I'm pouring** ***mí sangre*** **here. I don't want to hear jokes. (""pouring out my blood"" Is a saying in mexico similar to ""pouring my heart out"")**

**chikí:** ***Mija*** **look, this crap show is not going to end if you don't say your peace. This not your monkeys so not your circus! I know it can be scary to standing-up for yourself. But sometimes, you need to tell your homies to cut their shit.** 

**Me:** \*looks down\* **You're probably right.**

**Chikí: I AM right, you got this! and tell yourself ""I got this!"" but mean it this time!** 

**Me: I don't know Chikí, easy to say when you have someone in your corner.** 

**Chikí: I got you chíca! Just call me, I have two weeks off.** 

**Me:** ***Gracias prima, y gracias para déjame vivir aquí.*** **I know I'm being a handful. {Thanks cousin, and thanks for letting stay here.}** 

**Chikí: The only reason I'm letting you stay here so I can have a baby-sitter for my kids.**

**Me: Shut up** ***prima!*** **\*giggles\***

After play fighting and giggling, I get dressed for the day and try to finish any homework but I get a text from Bestbro asking if Artlad' is with me or at lease have heard of him at all. I texted back a ""no"" and ask why? Artlad and Bestbro always spend weekends with each other, always going to parties or some group hang-out but know it seems I'm knowing Artlad less and less. So I wanted to give Artlad another chance so I texted him asking what is going on.

**Me: Hey Artlad, are going to see Bestbro today? he texted me all worried.** 

**Artlad: Oh hey Dizzy! Sorry, forgot to text him that was busy today. I'll text him now.** 

**Me: Ok good. Glad nothing is wrong.**

**Artlad: Uh, actually there IS something wrong.** 

**Me: Like?**

**Artlad: I wanted to talk to you on Friday but you left home so I couldn't. I have time later if you want to meet up.** 

**Me: Like where? I don't have money nor the energy for a bar-club.**

**Artlad: No no, I want to meet-up at the park we use to hang out back in high school. Just you and me.** 

**Me: IDK dude, I'm still thinking about what you did.** 

**Artlad: That's why I want to meet up. I want to tell you the truth.** 

**Me: Fine.**

**Artlad: Thanks Dizzy.** 

We set up the time we can meet and I started to mentally prepare for whatever the truth was. But I didn't tell him I've told both Bestbro and Chikí about this meet up in case I DO need back-up. This park in near the high school we both went to, this park is known for both teens buying weed and my old high school's make-out point. These park is also near to a shopping center so if I need to run, I could run there. However the meet-up was pass 4pm so I couldn't make a scene since no one is around. I texted Artlad to tell him what part of the park I was at and waited. 

**Artlad: Hey Dizzy, how have you been?**

**Me: I've been better.** 

**Artlad: You're not mad at me?**

**Me: That depends on what this ""truth"" is. I hope you're not telling someone else's story to make-up for it?**

**Artlad: No no, I wanted tell you the whole truth. To be honest, I wasn't a good friend to you.**

**Me: Nah really!?**

**Artlad: Dude please. I'm not playing here.** 

**Me: You did something to Queenie and I was dragged to it just because the girl ""dressed"" like me.** 

**Artlad: It's more then just that. Queenie seems to not want to let it go.** 

**Me: What do you mean?**

**Artlad: Dizzy, this is the first time were I don't want the friends I've made to be part of my life. Yet I can't. Sourface and Queenie are willing to blackmail me or at lease that's what Queenie told me.** 

**Me: Do you believe that? Or you want ME to believe that?**

**Artlad: No I don't! I don't believe that until Queenie.....**

**Me: Until What?** 

**Artlad: Until Queenie said she'll ruin all my relationships, including friendships. That's why she has her friends be mean to you.** 

**Me: They keep telling me that she's losing sleep and she's sad because you keep avoiding her.**

**Artlad: WHAT!? I NEVER AVOIDED HER! In fact, she's avoiding me!**

**Me: Fucking bull!**

**Artlad: I swear! Ever since we shared our phone numbers for the club, she hasn't stop texting me while avoiding me when ever I tell need to clear up things with you! Only to find out her friends are mean to you and them trying to meddle with.....everything!**

**Me: I never gave my number to her. It never happened!**

**Artlad: What, yes it did! She came up to me saying she was looking for the club members so she get their numbers to notify everybody about events!**

**Me: She never came up to me! In fact, I haven't seen her since the first meeting!**

**Artlad: Really!? FUCK SHE TRICKED ME!** 

**Me: She tricked you?** 

**Artlad: YES! Also there's a reason why I couldn't say no to Queenie.** 

**Me: And the reason is?**

**Artlad: The first few moments with her and Sourface seems normal, but down the road......she got......clingy.** 

**Me: Clingy?** 

**Artlad: I did pick-up her hints but I just don't girls who is clingy. As in needing me to be around her all the time.** 

**Me: Is that why you keep toying with her?**

**Artlad: I swear I'm not! Dizzy, I've showed those screenshots before I finally told her to stop! And I did it after this last meeting!**

**Me: Did you really?!**

**Artlad: Yes, and I've quit too! I WAS SO FUCKING STUPID TO THINK QUEENIE WILL LEAVE ME ALONE AFTER I SAW HER AND SOURFACE TOGETHER! EVER SINCE SOURFACE TOLD HE AND QUEENIE ARE COUSINS AND I JUST WANNED TO DIP-OUT! I WAS A FUCKING ASSHOLE TO BOTH YOU AND BESTBRO! And all because I hate being alone. I wish I was like you Dizzy, being ok with the idea of being alone.**

**Me: And yet you told HIM about my past and drag me along to the lion's den. Artlad, just because Queenie is clingy, doesn't mean you have to put up with her shit and drag others along just because you're afraid being lonely.** 

**Artlad: It's not that, I know made it worst by lying to Cherry about your mental health and by lying to Ms. Mal-Doll and Bonbon that girls like you is what I'm into. But, now Sourface has a ""in"" on me.** 

**Me: In?**

**Artlad: Goodfella, might be catching on and might spill the truth to Sourface's family.** 

**Me: WHO THE HELL IS GOODFELLA!? Great, more people to deal with!**

**Artlad:** \*takes a deep breath\* **Look, I can give you his number and I'll text him about it. I think he'll want to talk about what happened to you on Monday. Goodfella, is also in this shit cuz Queenie, Sourface and Goodfella are being funded by the same family member.** 

**Me: I don't like where this is going. I just want out!**

**Artlad: And he'll help ya. From what he has told me, this isn't his first rodeo dealing with their bullshit. He thinks it's like a game they play.**

**Me: Artlad are you fucking with me? Just say you fucked up and not make up a BS story!**

Again, I'm not making this up! If I read this from someone else I would think the same thing! Back then I DIDN'T! But I really did lived this nightmare. It's a nightmare because I went to college with a couple of I guess incestuous individuals, but later on, I did found out that those said individuals just drags people to their shit because toxic people always drags others. In my journal however, I wrote that I think Artlad was just lying to be with THE most ridiculous lie I've ever heard. I mean come on, would you believe someone if they were telling you that they have someone being crazy clingy and oh yeah THEY ALSO FUCKING THEIR COUSIN AS WELL? Maybe in Alabama but not in California. With that, Artlad give me Goodfella's number and headed home. I however, Went to the shopping center just found a coffee place to drink some good ol' coffee and to think. I was 19 not 21, otherwise would drank to forget about the bullshit like a true Mexican/college student. After that I when back home and Sunday was uneventful until I got a message from an unknown number late at night. To my Introverts out there, you know damn I was close to not answering that text. But I got another one claiming to be Goodfella. Again it was years ago and I don't remember word for word but it was like:

**Goodfella: Hello, I've heard you wanted to talk to me? It's Goodfella BTW. I've got your number from Artlad.** 

**Me: OH! You must be the guy Artlad told me about. What and how do know about Queenie and Sourface? I'm sure Artlad told what's been going on?**

**Goodfella: Yes, but I rather talk in person. I promise I won't do anything Sourface would do.** 

**Me: I don't know dude, I'm not buying what Artlad told me. How do I know you're not just a friend of his doing him a favor?**

**Goodfella: Trust me, after this I'm out of your life. I don't want to part of this as much as you do but I kinda have to. For reasons.**

**Me: Uh huh? Right.**

**Goodfella: Look I go to the same college as you, we can meet at the sport's field that's near the art building. I have classes near there.**

**Me: I do too. Ok then, can you meet me there at around noon or so on Monday? I have a three hour gap for my next class.** 

**Goodfella: That could work, I'm out at maybe 1pm so yeah sounds good?** 

**Me: Ok sure.**

**Goodfella: See you Monday.** 

In comes Monday, I remember that Monday morning being ok but also feeling both nervous and that I'm being pranked. Around the time to meet up I texted Goodfella, I where I was I waited and wonder who he is.

**Goodfella: Hey, are you Dizzy? I'm Goodfella.**

**Me: Yes! I'm Dizzy, nice to meet you.**

In front of me was a chubby guy who kinda looks like Sourface, however smaller in weight but similar in height. 

**Me:** **Are you related to Sourface?**

**Goodfella: Sourface is my older brother. And Queenie is my step-cousin. My uncle remarried when I was 8 and I've known Queenie since then.** 

**Me: Sourface....your brother.....**

**Goodfella: Yeah, he doesn't like me since I've came out as Androsexual.**

**Me: Androsexual?** 

**Goodfella: Someone who like masculinity, regardless of gender.** 

**Me: Huh cool but how's being.....that...have to do was going on?**

**Goodfella: Well I'm not close to Queenie but I do know Sourface. Sourface have been in trouble for he's behavior but my family didn't do much until he and Queenie got.......close.** 

**Me: Close? But Queenie, likes Artlad and.....**

**Goodfella: Well Queenie doesn't like it anymore and from what I can see and/or hear, she just wants a hot guy just to have a hot boyfriend.** 

**Me: Ok.....**

**Goodfella: Look, my advice to you is to quit the club now. I don't know she even started a club and she made about....HAES right?**

**Me: Why? I mean I know why I mean why only that?**

**Goodfella: I don't think she'll prevent it from turning into a toxic environment with her bullshit. Her problems are everybody's problems. Plus from what I've heard, she's not even doing the work and having one person do everything. And if she IS running the club, this past Friday made everybody eat a snack and almost fought with Sourface in front of everyone. And their fights tend to be........bad. I don't want to go into details.** 

**Me: Why are you telling me this? It's not like you care about the club right?**

**Goodfella: I'm helping you because I've heard though the grapevine that Sourface was all.....touchy feely with you. Plus now that my uncle helping not only me, but also Queenie and Sourface, he's kinda rich but never had kids of his own. And he have said if both Sourface and Queenie ""acted up"" like that, he would cut them off. It's to ""curved"" them into better people but Sourface have always been like this and I done with he's bullshit.** 

**Me: And you want him to be cut off by your uncle? That's kinda going a little too far right?**

**Goodfella: And fucking your cousin isn't?**

**Me: fair point but still, why ruin he's chances of earning a degree?**

**Goodfella: Community College only has AA degrees right? Two year degrees.** 

**Me: yeah?**

**Goodfella: He's been earning that AA since he was 18.** 

**Me: OH! He's 21 now!**

**Goodfella: All he does is sign up for two classes a week and gets money from our uncle thinking he has like 4 or 5 classes. He doesn't even check and Sourface cries to mom and dad for more money while I get a job and try to be more self-sufficient. I don't want to stay home anymore. Again, I don't want to go into details.** 

**Me: So let get this right, you want me to tell you how he acted last time so you can some petty points from seeing him getting cut off?**

**Goodfella: yup!** 

**Me: I don't know dude, I just want to continue college drama-free.** 

**Goodfella: But you'll never have to go though that again.** 

For some reason, I did want to go though it but not before clarifying if this is a prank. Like I've said, there's too much going on and if it was someone else writing this story, I won't believe it at all. He was 100% truthful, but I didn't like his plan. Not because it was hurting Queenie's and Sourface's degrees but the plan was fucking awful. And told him as such.

**Me: Dude I'll help you but your plan is awful. They won't believe you.** 

**Goodfella: HUH? Why not?** 

**Me: If implied to me that your family has caught them before, then you need evidence and as well as me going to them and telling out right.**

**Goodfella: Go on.....**

**Me: First, I need time to think of a better plan but I'll text you when I've thought of something good.** 

**Goodfella: deal.** 

Shook hands and left the area in different ways but was fine until I ran into Queenie. 

**Me: Oh! hey Queenie how wa-**

\*SMACK\* I got bitch-slapped a crossed the face, HARD!

**Me: OWW, WHAT THE HEL-**

**Queenie: STAY AWAY FROM MY BOYFRIEND!**

**Me: HUH?! BOYFRIEND? SINCE WHEN!?**

**Queenie: We're not official, at lease not yet. I follow Artlad the other day and saw you and Artlad at the park! HOMEWREAKING BITCH!** 

**Me: HUH!? YOU STALKED HIM AND CALLING ME A HOMEWREAKER?!** 

**Queenie: Because you are! He's mine! I've tried everything to get him to notice me and yet he only likes skinny bitches!** 

**Me: I'M FAT TOO!** 

**Queenie: YOU'RE SKINNIER THEN MEEEEEEE! HE'S DOES THAT TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT MY BODY. I'M HEALTHY! I'M WHAT A REAL WOMAN SHOULD LOOK LIKE!!!!** 

**Me: Queenie! What the actual fuck! I. DONT. LIKE. ARTLAD!** 

**Queenie: FUCK YOU SKINNY WHORE! YOUR MOTHER IS A WHORE TOO AND YOUR DAD IS A LOSER!!!**

What did you say about my mama?! And did you call my father a loser?! I've felt something, something boiling. As well as something.....hardening. You may push me around and call me names. But nobody talks about my family like that, no one! Dear readers, I remember writing my journal that finally stand-up for myself and feeling good.

**Me:** ***VETE A LA VERGA HIJA DE PUTA!*** **{go fuck yourself son of a bitch!} (I will not translate 100% because it WILL demonetize reddx's channel so no)**  

**Queenie: WHAT YOU SA-**

**Me: NO SHUT THE FUCK UP! I'M DONE WITH YOUR SHIT AND YOUR FLYING MONKEYS!** 

**Queenie: YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S A HOMEWREAKER!**

**Me:** ***O QUE LA CHI-*** **I'M NOT DATING HIM! NOR AM I FUCKING HIM! {mother fu-}**

**Queenie: You're lying!** 

**Me: I don't care what you think and I'm fucking quitting the club!** 

**Queenie: YOU CAN'T QUIT!** 

**Me: Oh yes I fucking can! By the way! CHERRY IS A BETTER PERSIDENT THEN YOU! SHE'S THE ONE DOING ALL THE WORK! So fuck off!** 

I flipped her off as I walk pass by her, I was so angry I just walked anywhere and seem to walk into a event that what look to be hosted by the LGBTQ club. I didn't mean to but that when I've meet some members and they give me booklets about what it means to be gay/queer/trans and in my moment of anger, I've walked into something that made me realize I was trans this enter time! but oh boy, me being trans was it's own can of worms but that's a different tale but it will be relevant to this story. and before you ask, NO I DID NOT DATE GOODFELLA! But he did help me but that's a spoiler. 

I'll ended here, thanks for reading I know this is short but there's only two or three parts left of this tale and this isn't my ""shining"" moment. Again my English could use some work but don't be afraid to correct me and tell how my writing sucks. It helps to know. Drink lot of fluids ~~not mountain dew,~~ with peace and love, DIZZY OUT!

I recently switched to the SLT Fibre Trio Shine package, and they threw in android box and 75 PeoTV channels with it. I never watched TV much before, but now I’m actually enjoying it.  
Except the Android PeoTV box they gave me is ""*super* slow"". I’ve heard the older white boxes were faster, but I don’t have one.

**Question**

Since I already have Google TV with IPTV options, I’m wondering: can I bypass the SLT PeoTV box altogether?  
  
I looked around on YouTube and didn’t find much, so I figured I’d ask the experts here.

Without further ado, I'll mainly add these as bullet points from start to finish, which can also act as a means of more experienced travellers to review, and help not only me out, but other fledgling travellers!

**Trains, Planes, money, and you!**

* Beforehand, make suuuuuure you fill in the customs form beforehand to get a handy QR code at visitjapanweb, I had to find a spot to park my backside and fill that in beforehand, which was a minor inconvenience, but didn't really impact my trip overall.
* I had found the process of going from my home countries airport a bit daunting being a solo-flyer, but is fairly similar to domestic travel, just check your luggage in and tag it at kiosks branded with your airline of choice, get your boarding pass, go through customs, find your gate, board it when it's the right time, then go through the next reverse step!.
* Arriving in Haneda airport for a lengthy walk to the baggage collection, I then used my new QR code from the previous website to scan at a kiosk, I then went through another customs gate, then it was time to figure out how transport works!
* Beforehand, I carried a fair bit of Japanese money on me that I had exchanged months prior due to the almost even exchange rate, as well as having plenty of cash on a travel card. If I had to do anything differently, I'd keep all of it on my travel card account, keep 1 to freely access and another as backup for if I lose it, and just carry roughly enough for about $100 a day, although ATM's were almost everywhere that I went, so even that much might not be necessary.
* I had proceeded to the IC card kiosks just left of the main arrival point, which can easily be recognized if you're anything like me and have seen plenty of travel videos beforehand to get your bearings, just top it up with about 10 000yen and if you're anything like me and traveled by train a lot and purchased food at convenience stores, you'll go through it quick enough, which is fine because most convenience stores (7/11, Family Mart and Lawsons) have ATM's, so you'll rarely be in a position where you're stuck without money, assuming you're not in the sticks somewhere. 
* Whilst trains are exceptionally easy to travel on in Japan and Google maps is your best friend in planning which stations to be on and how to get there, be prepared to take a lot of stairs and keep your energy up, I had about 1 or two instances where I nearly fell down the stairs purely because it just isn't that common to have that many stairs in my country, so make sure you're fairly fit and ready for a bit of leg-work. I found myself using the Yamanote train line fairly often, but don't hesitate walking to your destination if the weather is fine and is less than 15 minutes away. I found some really nice scenic views while walking from Asakusa to Tokyo Sky Tree and little moments like that really add to the trip. Trains also call out your stops in English, which will be memorable to you after your trip.
* Always aim to be early, rather than on-time, as getting your bearings might eat up your time, or you might unintentionally lose track of time and find yourself rushing necessarily as I did on a couple occasions. Trains leave rather early in the morning and even though I had a 8am flight, I was able to leave on a train around 4:30am without any issues from the normal trains and Tokyo monorail, which were available rather frequently.

  
**You, Japan, and your well-being**  


* Having traveled in the tail-end of their summer, I was immediately caught off guard with how humid it was, so much that I ended up with heat rash and had to pay a visit to a clinic to get some cream for it. My visit to the clinic was very straightforward, and I was done there within just over an hour with no prior bookings, plus they spoke good enough English that I was able to combine with my limited Japanese to get the issue under control and got back to my trip as intended, with only being out of pocket a couple hundred dollars which my travel insurance will likely cover (**GET IT, TRUST ME, DON'T GO WITHOUT IT!** :) I was lucky enough to have accommodation near a Matsumoto Kiyoshi, which is a really good drugstore that carried all your essentials like soap, shampoos, dental care etc, so I promptly purchased some sensitive skin products and had no further issues since :)
* At no point did I feel particularly unsafe during my trip, I had experienced briefs instances of staff in stores who clearly weren't either having a good day or just had a brief moment of moodiness, but it was barely enough to be considered an overall bad experience in dealing with them.
* Learning Japanese isn't necessary in getting around in your trip, but it helps tremendously if things go pear-shaped. I had an instance where I went outside the main ticket gate at Fuji Q and having used the facescan for my tickets to exit in the same fashion, my face wasn't registered when doing the sky-walk outside of the park, despite being a part of their payed attractions. I'm not entirely sure what prompted the error, but I was able to communicate with my limited Japanese, as well as show my photo's of being in the park having just ridden the Fujiyama coaster beforehand, which also helped out in solving my issue at the time.
* Make sure you keep plenty of coins on you for laundry! I had to use my hotels washing machines and one thing you will need cash for in my circumstances is 100yen coins to feed the washing machine/dryer combo. I'll always make sure that if I'm out, I'll either drop 1 or 2 1000 yen notes into the crane-game coin exchangers, or to just buy something from a convenience store, and just ask for more 100yen coins if possible, which I had to do one morning when I had to do laundry, but the arcades were closed at the time.
* If you find yourself being stuck in the rain and not sure how to find an umbrella, just purchase one from a convenience store and just grab one of the cheapest and largest ones (clear top, black handle). I was fortunate enough that the desk at my hotel was able to take my umbrella from me on my last day in Japan, as transporting it back home seemed impractical and just wouldn't fit with my luggage.
* For those who are tall, don't stress too much in clothing size and finding a spot for you to fit, as just about everywhere I went was rather accommodating for a person of my stature (196cm) and besides maybe 1 or 2 roller coasters I couldn't ride at Fuji Q, there isn't any real issues outside of that you'd encounter, with a minor exception to the handles that hang from the roof in train carriages.
* It doesn't hurt at any point to check reviews for your accommodation and getting your bearings beforehand, as you'll want more time to actually enjoy your trip, instead of dwelling on preparing for the trip back. One thing I hadn't noticed was in my hotels lobby, they had a scale available for weighing your luggage, which I had already purchased a handheld hook weight from Don Quijote, which is a really accurate and cost effective way to do so if you're not as lucky with luggage weighing options.

  
**Food, glorious Food!**  


* If you're anything like me and want to enjoy some fun ways to dine out, consider booking one of the many concept cafe options that are available in Japan. I went to the Kirby Cafe and Final Fantasy 14 Eorzea cafe and I just loved the vibe and well decorated interior, plus the food was really enjoyable and added to the experience! Do note that these are booked in advance and whilst the Eorzea Cafe is quite easy to get a booking for at the moment, the Kirby one will go within minutes, so consider what time and day would best suit your itinerary, which could affect how freely you want to explore depending on what slot you succeed in getting.
* Ordering food in Japan is rather easy and most major restaurants will often have a tablet that more often than not, will have an English option available. I personally loved Dennys as not only was their western food options for when I just can't stomach a soup at the time, but the sheer quantity and quality of the food was great, plus the 1-time fee for unlimited coffee, tea and soft drink was the perfect way to end the day for me. 
* I didn't end up using cash very often at all for food and only did so for maybe a very small percentage of areas I wanted to eat at, so don't be too concerned with how much cash you have handy, just make a mental note to carry enough to potentially cover it.
* Another option is to always eat small meals so you can taste test as much as possible, something I had admittedly not done enough of. 

**S H O P P I N G**

* Don't hesitate to stop for a moment and do some light research on a little treasure you come across, as coming back at another time might mean it's already sold by then, or you'll run short or time and find yourself not being able to come back at a later date. Perhaps use a camera phone translation app, or just write it down and google it if possible.
* If you're an Anime/Game fan like myself and enjoy shopping for fun things, try to use the above tips to make sure what you're looking at isn't a limited item, as places can be packed with like-minded tourists and you might just lose your chance to get your shiny if someone beats you to the punch.
* I found a lot of places immensely packed with figures that you'll likely see in many places. I found it was a good idea to keep a mental note of what stores had a particularly common figure, then just gauge their prices by comparing it to other stores, I realized some places had some really nice figures not seen in other areas, but weren't necessarily cheap compared to some hidden gem stores.
* Don't hesitate to look around if you can manage to. Despite my previous comment about taking an opportunity when you see it, I often find that certain stores are much cheaper with the same products just a bit further out of town, so try and be wise with your purchases if it's something relatively common, as you're guaranteed to save an easy 1000 yen if you're smart about it.
* Tshirts were plentiful and easy to find in my particular size, but don't hesitate to ask for a test size (Testo saizu ga arimasu ka?), as the western equivalent size might be a size too small and you'd have wasted money on a now glorified rag.
* Even though it's not technically shopping as it is a form of gaming, I'll add that it might even be worth buying certain common things from crane machines at pawn shops instead, as you'll often find the machines won't hold their grip until a certain random point (also known as a power grip) and you could sink an easy few thousand yen in trying to get something that's technically much cheaper in the pawn shop next door.
* **MAKE, SURE, YOU, HAVE, LUGGAGE, SPACE.** No amount of crane games and shopping will be fun if you go overboard on something massive and find you gotta purchase another suitcase over $100 because you didn't plan to lose space (which thankfully didn't happen for me). Going overseas is fun and I highly suggest grabbing anything and everything you'd like, especially if it's a souvenir, but just be mindful on your luggage room beforehand in case you find you forgot to get souvenir snacks and see a row of large plushes instead. A potentially good idea is to cram random things from your house into the suitcase to gauge how heavy it will get and if you want to invest in another suitcase to store inside the bigger one for your trip, or to just buy one over in Japan that also doubles as another souvenir for yourself.
* Shopping malls and shrines are a fantastic place to find souvenirs. I ended up purchasing quite a few things in places like Sunshine City in Ikebukuro, any Don Quijote, Tokyo Sky Tree just East of Asakusa, and the  charms from Asakusa to name a few. I'd encourage to just look in random stores out and about if you're feeling adventurous too, as you can find some really interesting things that way for a decent price.

**BONUS - KARAOKE**  
  
I decided to try out Big Echo Karaoke, and it was fairly easy to do, provided you follow a few tips.

* Have the names of the songs prepared on your phone in advance and if you're able to say the names clearly in Japanese, there's a small orange icon near the text field which is a microphone feature, simple speak the song of your choice into it and bam, your song should appear.
* Make sure to take note of the artist names and the year the song was made, so you don't do what I did and pick some random remix of an Anime Song, based off the one you were looking for.
* English songs are available, but I'd highly recommend using this as an opportunity to not only test out your Japanese, but to also just have fun, as it's a great way to unwind and just belt out random lyrics, be it by yourself, or with a group of friends.
* Try not to eat and drink too much, as you're paying to sing by the hour and unless you take turns with a group of people, you're literally eating into your time, the main benefit only being you can order by a tablet and they bring it to your room.
* The overall price is fairly decent, the sizes of the rooms are fairly big and private, plus you can adjust the Karaoke system itself in case you think your tone deaf friend is singing a bit too loud for your liking.

Overall, Japan is a fairly easy and fun place to navigate, but just make sure like anywhere you travel that you be mindful of what to do if you're stuck and I'd say you'll have an absolute blast!

**Here are a few things I'd like to know when going back to Japan again.**

* What are the best times of year that don't have humidity.
* What's your experience with driving and parking in Japan, particularly the Tokyo area and outside of that if you're a tourist. I'd like to potentially see some nature and not be bombarded by the popular tourist spots like I did in Shinjuku and Shibuya, which ended up being my least favorite spots as a result.
* Where are some good areas online to talk to people so you can meet them in person once you travel to Japan.
* I'd like some personal recommendations for not only stores in Akihabara, but anything similar outside that area, as I feel I barely scratched the surface for gaming/anime goodies outside of Akiba, with exception to Nakano Broadway.
* Whats a good time-frame for visiting Kyoto and Osaka, as I feel the Nintendo Museum and Super Nintendo World could be fun for a second trip, amongst the other traditional options.
* Day trips via the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) that won't eat your wallet whole.",1,1729836906.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.67,False
