1qxghh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1qxghh2/10_days_po/,10 days PO,"I am 10 days PO now and it feels like I am recovering too quickly almost considering I had a full abdominal cut from above the belly button down, everything out, just left 1 ovary. The only slight issue was some leaking from my incision a few days ago but they checked it over and it was just some fluid build up behind the incision so they weren't worried. They were amazed how neat the incision was, it was internally stitched, glued, then I had a 7 day PICO device on which accelerated the healing. I was discharged home 4 days PO.
I can go up and down stairs unaided and have been doing that a few days now without a cane. I shower and dress myself apart from putting shoes on. I have been out for coffee twice as a passenger in the car this week. I have no pain apart from a bit of pain when sitting and standing where the incision pulls slightly. Sleeping through the night now after the hot flushes have stopped. I think the lone ovary is working alright as I have discharge and urges returning to normal! She did say to keep moving about just no twisting, bending, or lifting, so I am taking that literally! I am more mobile now since before the surgery as I had adenomyosis and a large cyst which was twisted and causing inflammation so I spent a lot of time laying on the sofa before the op.

They keep coming and making my days a bit more interesting! Now addressing your questions and proper thanks to:

u/a_wild_armaldo, thank you so much for the cute kitties that say *""it's totally ok if what all I did today is to look hella cute*"". Hell yeah, I agree, and that's my life mission for this weekend so all the dishes can wait. hah! 

As for your question, yes, I do like to read! I just finished **""Border: A Journey To The Edge Of Europe""** by Kapka Kassabova. She writes beautifully about the stories and people on the border between Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece. I usually read mostly fiction (queer, dystopias, diversity or feminist and/or social justice themes), but this was a very interesting read. I'm doing the around the world challenge. As for hobbies, aside from reading, I also game just like you! I used to do craft projects as well, but I feel like I lost all skills and any creative spark. I also used to do loads of online stuff (blogging, online communities, etc), but that has gone as well. Now I'm in a phase of trying to get hobbies as I live a very isolated life, but unfortunately haven't found anything accessible yet. Hopefully I will. 🙂

u/ComtessedeVampire, more kitties! Oh, one of the first things I did when I moved to Finland years ago was to do a big shopping on a local stationary shop. It's not so financially accessible nowadays, but I still have a good haul of things to use so that's ok! Do you have many stationary shops there? Here not really, it's sad. I wish we could go back 10 years, also the stamps were cheaper... lol

You would like it here today because it's snowing! It's always so pretty. The after-snow is worse, when the floor becomes so slippery that dropping off some mail is almost life-or-detah situations haha! Also your mention of the baltic sea made me realise that we can both look in its direction at the same time. Ok. Don't mind me, just an idea if we ever need to communicate through the winds. 😆

  
u/CatMoon1111, what a beautifully decorated card! Cats and bats! I won snail-mail lottery, seriously. I need more black/spooky washi tapes and decorations. Most of the spooky stuff I encountered here for sale was still a bit too cutesy/cartoony, but I absolutely loved these ones you decorated it with, totally my style.

I understand tense weeks, it seems that's been a constant over here for the past few months. I hope you have had better days after you sent me this card! How do you drink your coffee (filter, expresso, milk, etc)? I came from my (long) walk, so I will try to do myself a cappuccino even though it's way past 11 in the morning, but I'm not italian so I won't be personally offended to drink it after that time. hah! My cat was running like crazy and sliding under the rug so fast, it was hilarious. Lately she is obsessed with the shower. Now thankfully she is asleep so I can focus on writing this. But cats and coffees... perfection, isn't it? Especially during tense seasons of our lives. 😺",1,1770381439.0,RandomActsofCards,1,1.0,False

Someone made a casual comment about kids, the usual stuff like “you’ll change your mind” or “you’ll understand later”. Same tone, same smile, nothing new at all. Normally that kind of comment would stick with me for hours. I’d replay it in my head, get annoyed, feel the urge to explain myself to an imaginary audience. But this time I just nodded, changed the subject, finished my coffee and went on with my day. No irritation, no inner rant, nothing.  A few hours later I realised… it didnt bother me. At all. 

At first I thought that was a win. Like ok, growth, thicker skin, finally at peace with my choice. But then it felt a little off. Those comments used to hurt because they felt dismissive, like people werent really listening to me as a full adult person. Now they didnt hurt because I had stopped expecting understanding in the first place. That part surprised me. It wasnt acceptance from them, it was detachment from me. I didnt feel the need to defend  myself anymore, but I also didnt feel the need to connect on that level. 

I dont feel angry or bitter  about it, just… different. Being childfree stopped feeling like a decision I constantly stand behind and explain. It’s just part of my life now, like my job or where I live. And while that brings a lot of calm, it also came with this quiet realization that some conversations will always stay surface level, and thats fine. I’m ok with that now, I think.

Okay, so I have a confession: I bought something *purely* because it looked ridiculous online—and now I can’t stop using it.

Meet my **GoGoTales AirPods Lipstick**.

At first glance, you’d swear it’s an actual Apple AirPods case. But pop it open? Instead of earbuds, there are two sleek, refillable lipstick bullets—one bold red, one soft rose. The magnetic snap feels premium, the mirror inside is actually usable, and the whole thing fits perfectly in my jeans pocket (unlike my chunky old lipstick tubes).

I pulled it out at a coffee shop last week, and the barista literally did a double-take: *“Wait… is that—?”* Cue 10 minutes of us laughing and her asking where to get one.

But beyond the meme-worthy design, the formula is shockingly good:

* Creamy but not sticky
* Lasts through coffee *and* a light meal
* No weird chemical smell
* Refills available (eco win!)

It’s silly, yes—but it also makes me smile every time I use it. And in a world of beige compacts, standing out feels like self-care.

If you’re into playful luxury or just need a mood boost in your makeup bag, this might be your next obsession. (Not sponsored—just a very amused customer.)

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

If we were to trade favorite poems or songs tonight, which one would tell me the most about who you really are?",1,1770381329.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

I do believe in energy and people’s “souls” as a variation of energy that continues beyond life and death, however, I often roll my eyes and feel people are silly (because I don’t understand it - my intention is not to be unkind) when people mention special talents or connections that showcase energy (reiki, mediums, energy healers, etc). 

I think it is time I stop rolling my eyes and try to better understand. 

For the past few years, electronics and me do not agree. I’ve “broken” at least

\- two coffee makers

\- my Amazon fire stick

\- a tv

My dishwasher, grill and microwave all “glitch” when I’m the one operating them. These are just the things that pop into my mind!

For instance the grill starter won’t work sometimes until my husband stands next to me. My microwave will be counting down then make a noise and jump by adding time. May I add this does not happen to my husband! 

What inspired me to reach out for advice and suggestions is that just this week I killed my coffee maker out of nowhere and my washer suddenly became temperamental! These are 5 year old appliances and we take care of them. 

Some people tell me… do more grounding work but I meditate, stretch and do yoga, started walking outside without shoes… this doesn’t seem to work!

I have been experiencing quite a few really bad luck health issues over the past 10 years - unplanned c section where I ended up intubated, broken ankle slipping on ice, complicated painful pregnancies, herniated disc that led to back surgery, and a month later emergency appendectomy… not to mention I’m still in chronic pain. 

If anyone works in energy work and can offer some insights, PLEASE I want to hear from you. I can’t keep killing electronics and I have a feeling my health issues somehow tied to this!!! I just want to know what you all think!",1,1770381324.0,energy_work,1,1.0,False

5 YEARS LATER (Sunday afternoon)

My friend Mo has a bakery now.

Like, an actual bakery with a window sign that says MO’S / WARMTH SOLD HERE, which sounds like a scam until you walk in and inhale cinnamon and forgiveness.

We’re all there—five of us—laughing the way people laugh when they’ve crawled out of their own personal pits and are still shocked they didn’t die down there.

Jade wipes frosting off Nina’s mouth with her thumb, which is a level of domestic intimacy that should be illegal in public. Nina looks at her like “I would commit tax fraud for you.”

Leo, who used to be the prince of “one more shot,” is strumming a guitar in the corner. It’s only three chords but they somehow sound like an apology that learned to stand up straight.

And me? I’m pretending I’m not tearing up into a paper cup of coffee that tastes like new beginning and I swear I’m fine.

Mo goes, “Funny thing—my whole life changed because somebody returned a ring once.”

And we all nod like wise adults, like this is a parable we studied in school, not something that started in a club bathroom with broken locks and bass loud enough to erase your childhood.



3 YEARS LATER (Friday, 2:13 a.m.)

Leo is standing in a church hall that smells like stackable chairs and second chances.

He says, “I hit bottom. Then I found a handrail.”

Everyone claps softly, like they’re petting a frightened animal called Hope.

Afterwards he texts Jade:

Still sober. Still breathing. Tell Nina I’m sorry for that time I tried to flirt with the DJ and fell into a cactus 🌵



Trauma loves a punchline.

He plays guitar now instead of playing himself. It’s not miraculous. It’s just one decision, repeated until your body starts believing you.



2 YEARS LATER (Wednesday, 8:40 p.m.)

Nina’s a teacher.

She pins a student’s drawing on the wall. It’s two brides, a cake, and a dragon. The dragon is labeled ANXIETY in block capitals.

Nina laughs so hard she snorts and goes, “Yeah. Accurate. Now color it in.”

She teaches art because Jade once told her, “You’re not too much. You’re the whole damn weather system.”

And Nina believed her, which (I’m sorry) is basically the sexiest thing in the world: being seen and not apologized for.



1 YEAR LATER (Saturday, 11:59 p.m.)

Mo quits his pub job mid-shift.

No tray thrown. No monologue. Just takes off the apron like it’s cursed and leaves it on a chair like a dead bird.

He starts baking for real. His first pastries come out looking like sad moons.

He names them REGRETS and sells out anyway.

People love a messy origin story. Makes the sugar feel earned.



OKAY, BUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE CAKE (because we almost did a second timeline in prison)

Somewhere in the middle of all this, there was another wedding.

Not Jade and Nina’s. Different couple, fancy venue, wedding planner named Mara who looked like she’d been forged out of spreadsheets and pure will.

Mo’s bakery got the order—except Mo had an exhausted trainee that week (Theo) and a printer running low on ink, and two label rolls sitting side by side:

WEDDING

DIVORCE PARTY


Theo grabbed the wrong roll. Stuck it on the box. Didn’t notice because tired brains are slippery liars.

Now add one more “tiny choice” from a completely different person: the friend who ordered it (Jules) clicked a little toggle on the delivery app:

✅ Leave at door if no answer

They thought they were being considerate.

They were, in fact, summoning chaos.

Because the courier (Pip) arrives at the venue and there are two identical doors with two identical chalkboards that both say WELCOME with little hearts like the universe is laughing quietly.

Pip picks the left door.

Left door is a post-divorce celebration with a glitter banner that says FREEDOM LOOKS GOOD ON YOU, BABE.

Pip drops off the cake. Gets a signature. Leaves. Efficient. Professional. Like a bullet with a delivery fee.

Right door is the actual wedding.

So when the wedding finally gets their cake, it’s not just wrong—it’s mythically wrong.

Front and center, in edible fondant, a banner reads:

CONGRATS ON THE DIVORCE!

The room does that synchronized inhale people do when they witness disaster but don’t want to commit to helping. A child laughs like a tiny villain. Someone’s mum says, “Well. That’s… modern.”

It trends. Of course it trends. Nothing dies anymore; it just gets reposted with worse punctuation.

A podcast does an episode called “The Cake That Ended a Career.”
The comments are a bonfire.
Theo gets hate mail like frosting is a felony.

And the moral is so boring it hurts:

Check the label.
Check the door.
Don’t trust “leave at door.”



6 MONTHS LATER (Monday, 3:07 a.m.)

Jade stands on her balcony holding a ring and practicing a proposal speech to a plant that is actively dying from neglect.

She goes, “Nina, I—” chokes, laughs, swears, tries again.

She’s terrified in the specific way brave people get terrified: not of falling—of leaping.

Across town Nina is doom-scrolling old photos and thinking, If love is a trick, it’s the best one.

She sleeps with her phone on her chest like a guard dog.



THE NIGHT IT STARTED (Sunday, 1:22 a.m.)

The club is loud enough to erase your personality.

Leo is dancing like a man trying to outrun consequences.
Mo is pouring drinks like he’s pouring penance.
Nina is laughing—the kind of laugh that makes strangers want to be better people.
Jade is patting every pocket like she’s searching for God.

Because the ring is gone.

Panic blooms. The music doesn’t care. Someone yells “THIS ONE’S A BANGER!” as the universe laughs.

Jade bolts for the bathroom. Mascara in free fall. In the mirror she looks like a tragic heroine trapped in poor lighting and glitter.



7 MINUTES LATER (Sunday, 1:29 a.m.)

And here’s where I enter the story, stumbling in with the grace of a dropped kebab.

I’m in the bathroom for reasons that are mostly liquid. I open a stall door and—

There it is.

A ring on the floor, winking like an excuse.

And I have three thoughts in rapid succession:

1. This could pay rent.


2. This could buy silence.


3. This could be my villain era.



Then I imagine the person it belongs to—the way their throat would close, the way love would start tasting like metal.

So I pick it up.

And a tiny decision arrives, wearing my hand like a glove:

Return it
or become the kind of story people tell to scare their friends.



30 SECONDS LATER (Sunday, 1:30 a.m.)

Jade bursts in, wild-eyed, asking the universe, the drains, the tiles—“Please, please, please—”

I hold up the ring.

She freezes like time just found religion.

Her face cracks open into relief so pure it’s almost obscene. She laughs, then cries, then does both at once like her body can’t choose a genre.

She squeezes my hand, and in that squeeze are five futures trying not to drop themselves again.

And I say, like a liar, “Don’t mention it.”

(Reader, I have mentioned it constantly. I am human.)



AND THEN, BECAUSE LIFE IS GREEDY, I DID IT AGAIN (another tiny choice)

About a year after Ring Night, I moved into a new building.

There was a building group chat. You already know where this is going.

It was called: BUILDING 3B / ROOF LEAK / BIN DAY
which sounds like the least sexy place on earth, and yet.

Mrs. Patel (my neighbor) posted: “Reminder: don’t leave rubbish in the hallway.”

Gideon (a guy in the building who also happened to be my boss—because the universe loves efficiency) replied: “Some people have no class.”

It was about me. I knew it. I could’ve ignored it. I could’ve been mature.

Instead, I recorded a flirty voice note meant for Rowan—the cute HR guy at work who once said “Have a nice weekend” like it was scripture.

My plan: a wink.

My execution: chaos.

I hit send.

My thumb was slippery with lip balm and spite.

I sent it to the building group chat.

So now my neighbors—my boss—Mrs. Patel—everyone—received my voice going:

“Okay, listen… this is not safe for work, but neither am I…”



Not graphic, but suggestive enough that a nun would sprout a blush.

Then my phone vibrated like a guilty conscience.

Mrs. Patel: “HAZEL.”
Jax (downstairs, musician): “LMAO WHOSE VOICE NOTE WAS THAT???”
Gideon: “Disgusting.”
Rowan (private message): “Hi. It’s Rowan. I… think that was meant for me? Are you okay?”

Gideon forwarded it to management because some men mistake cruelty for a hobby.

HR meeting. Fluorescent lights. Gideon playing my own voice back at me like he invented shame.

Rowan, bless him, did something wildly attractive: he was kind and also competent.

He found out Gideon forwarded it to the whole company for “evidence” (aka spectacle).
Rowan recommended Gideon be terminated for gross misconduct.

Gideon got fired.

I quit.

Mrs. Patel bought me tea and called me “a good girl with a bad mouth,” which somehow felt like a crown.

Rowan walked me home, and—because humans are idiots with hearts—he admitted my voice was “kind of lovely.”

I said, “Are you flirting with me right now?”

He said, “I’m trying, but I’m nervous, so I’m doing it like a librarian.”

Anyway. We’re married now.



FULL CIRCLE (or: why I’m writing this at 2 a.m.)

Five years after Ring Night, I’m in a borrowed suit at an award ceremony holding a trophy heavy enough to feel like a moral.

They announce my play title:

KNOCK-ON EFFECT: A GROUP CHAT TRAGEDY

The room laughs before they even know why.

In the audience are the people I “accidentally” rearranged my life into:

Jade and Nina, married and smug about it

Leo, sober and shining

Mo, bakery-owner, still selling REGRETS

Mrs. Patel, now running a little comedy club called THE LANDING because apparently she decided retirement was for cowards

Rowan, my husband, pretending he’s not crying (he is failing)


Jax plays music for the venue now, and he wrote a song about “small decisions” that includes a verse about the time some idiot wore a traffic cone like a crown and caused a whole street to snarl into chaos.

(We don’t let him live that down. Ever.)

And I keep thinking about the origin of all of it:

A ring on a dirty floor.
A tiny checkbox in an app.
A thumb slipping on a send arrow.
A tired person grabbing the wrong label roll.

We think catastrophe arrives with horns and a villain grin.

Half the time it shows up as:

Delivered.

Sent.

✅ Leave at door.


So yeah.

If you ever feel small, remember this:

Small choices are not small.
They just wear tiny shoes.



TL;DR

Returned a ring I found in a club bathroom instead of selling it. That single decent choice spiraled into a friend group where: one guy got sober, one opened a bakery, two friends got married, and I somehow became a writer. Separately (but thematically), I once sent a flirty voice note to the building group chat by accident; my boss forwarded it to shame me, HR guy defended me, boss got fired, HR guy became my husband. Also a “leave at door” delivery toggle + wrong label roll caused a wedding cake to say CONGRATS ON THE DIVORCE and briefly set the internet on fire. Life is a timeline of tiny buttons and I hate it here (affectionate).

Edit: yes, Mrs. Patel is as terrifying in person as she sounds. No, she will not adopt you. She says she’s “full up on strays.”",1,1770381249.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

Somewhere in the middle of all this, there was another wedding.

Not Jade and Nina’s. Different couple, fancy venue, wedding planner named Mara who looked like she’d been forged out of spreadsheets and pure will.

Mo’s bakery got the order—except Mo had an exhausted trainee that week (Theo) and a printer running low on ink, and two label rolls sitting side by side:

WEDDING

DIVORCE PARTY


Theo grabbed the wrong roll. Stuck it on the box. Didn’t notice because tired brains are slippery liars.

Now add one more “tiny choice” from a completely different person: the friend who ordered it (Jules) clicked a little toggle on the delivery app:

✅ Leave at door if no answer

They thought they were being considerate.

They were, in fact, summoning chaos.

Because the courier (Pip) arrives at the venue and there are two identical doors with two identical chalkboards that both say WELCOME with little hearts like the universe is laughing quietly.

Pip picks the left door.

Left door is a post-divorce celebration with a glitter banner that says FREEDOM LOOKS GOOD ON YOU, BABE.

Pip drops off the cake. Gets a signature. Leaves. Efficient. Professional. Like a bullet with a delivery fee.

Right door is the actual wedding.

So when the wedding finally gets their cake, it’s not just wrong—it’s mythically wrong.

Front and center, in edible fondant, a banner reads:

CONGRATS ON THE DIVORCE!

The room does that synchronized inhale people do when they witness disaster but don’t want to commit to helping. A child laughs like a tiny villain. Someone’s mum says, “Well. That’s… modern.”

It trends. Of course it trends. Nothing dies anymore; it just gets reposted with worse punctuation.

A podcast does an episode called “The Cake That Ended a Career.”
The comments are a bonfire.
Theo gets hate mail like frosting is a felony.

And the moral is so boring it hurts:

Check the label.
Check the door.
Don’t trust “leave at door.”



6 MONTHS LATER (Monday, 3:07 a.m.)

Jade stands on her balcony holding a ring and practicing a proposal speech to a plant that is actively dying from neglect.

She goes, “Nina, I—” chokes, laughs, swears, tries again.

She’s terrified in the specific way brave people get terrified: not of falling—of leaping.

Across town Nina is doom-scrolling old photos and thinking, If love is a trick, it’s the best one.

She sleeps with her phone on her chest like a guard dog.



THE NIGHT IT STARTED (Sunday, 1:22 a.m.)

The club is loud enough to erase your personality.

Leo is dancing like a man trying to outrun consequences.
Mo is pouring drinks like he’s pouring penance.
Nina is laughing—the kind of laugh that makes strangers want to be better people.
Jade is patting every pocket like she’s searching for God.

Because the ring is gone.

Panic blooms. The music doesn’t care. Someone yells “THIS ONE’S A BANGER!” as the universe laughs.

Jade bolts for the bathroom. Mascara in free fall. In the mirror she looks like a tragic heroine trapped in poor lighting and glitter.



7 MINUTES LATER (Sunday, 1:29 a.m.)

And here’s where I enter the story, stumbling in with the grace of a dropped kebab.

I’m in the bathroom for reasons that are mostly liquid. I open a stall door and—

There it is.

A ring on the floor, winking like an excuse.

And I have three thoughts in rapid succession:

1. This could pay rent.


2. This could buy silence.


3. This could be my villain era.



Then I imagine the person it belongs to—the way their throat would close, the way love would start tasting like metal.

So I pick it up.

And a tiny decision arrives, wearing my hand like a glove:

Return it
or become the kind of story people tell to scare their friends.



30 SECONDS LATER (Sunday, 1:30 a.m.)

Jade bursts in, wild-eyed, asking the universe, the drains, the tiles—“Please, please, please—”

I hold up the ring.

She freezes like time just found religion.

Her face cracks open into relief so pure it’s almost obscene. She laughs, then cries, then does both at once like her body can’t choose a genre.

She squeezes my hand, and in that squeeze are five futures trying not to drop themselves again.

And I say, like a liar, “Don’t mention it.”

(Reader, I have mentioned it constantly. I am human.)



AND THEN, BECAUSE LIFE IS GREEDY, I DID IT AGAIN (another tiny choice)

About a year after Ring Night, I moved into a new building.

There was a building group chat. You already know where this is going.

It was called: BUILDING 3B / ROOF LEAK / BIN DAY
which sounds like the least sexy place on earth, and yet.

Mrs. Patel (my neighbor) posted: “Reminder: don’t leave rubbish in the hallway.”

Gideon (a guy in the building who also happened to be my boss—because the universe loves efficiency) replied: “Some people have no class.”

It was about me. I knew it. I could’ve ignored it. I could’ve been mature.

Instead, I recorded a flirty voice note meant for Rowan—the cute HR guy at work who once said “Have a nice weekend” like it was scripture.

My plan: a wink.

My execution: chaos.

I hit send.

My thumb was slippery with lip balm and spite.

I sent it to the building group chat.

So now my neighbors—my boss—Mrs. Patel—everyone—received my voice going:

“Okay, listen… this is not safe for work, but neither am I…”



Not graphic, but suggestive enough that a nun would sprout a blush.

Then my phone vibrated like a guilty conscience.

Mrs. Patel: “HAZEL.”
Jax (downstairs, musician): “LMAO WHOSE VOICE NOTE WAS THAT???”
Gideon: “Disgusting.”
Rowan (private message): “Hi. It’s Rowan. I… think that was meant for me? Are you okay?”

Gideon forwarded it to management because some men mistake cruelty for a hobby.

HR meeting. Fluorescent lights. Gideon playing my own voice back at me like he invented shame.

Rowan, bless him, did something wildly attractive: he was kind and also competent.

He found out Gideon forwarded it to the whole company for “evidence” (aka spectacle).
Rowan recommended Gideon be terminated for gross misconduct.

Gideon got fired.

I quit.

Mrs. Patel bought me tea and called me “a good girl with a bad mouth,” which somehow felt like a crown.

Rowan walked me home, and—because humans are idiots with hearts—he admitted my voice was “kind of lovely.”

I said, “Are you flirting with me right now?”

He said, “I’m trying, but I’m nervous, so I’m doing it like a librarian.”

Anyway. We’re married now.



FULL CIRCLE (or: why I’m writing this at 2 a.m.)

Five years after Ring Night, I’m in a borrowed suit at an award ceremony holding a trophy heavy enough to feel like a moral.

They announce my play title:

KNOCK-ON EFFECT: A GROUP CHAT TRAGEDY

The room laughs before they even know why.

In the audience are the people I “accidentally” rearranged my life into:

Jade and Nina, married and smug about it

Leo, sober and shining

Mo, bakery-owner, still selling REGRETS

Mrs. Patel, now running a little comedy club called THE LANDING because apparently she decided retirement was for cowards

Rowan, my husband, pretending he’s not crying (he is failing)


Jax plays music for the venue now, and he wrote a song about “small decisions” that includes a verse about the time some idiot wore a traffic cone like a crown and caused a whole street to snarl into chaos.

(We don’t let him live that down. Ever.)

And I keep thinking about the origin of all of it:

A ring on a dirty floor.
A tiny checkbox in an app.
A thumb slipping on a send arrow.
A tired person grabbing the wrong label roll.

We think catastrophe arrives with horns and a villain grin.

Half the time it shows up as:

Delivered.

Sent.

✅ Leave at door.


So yeah.

If you ever feel small, remember this:

Small choices are not small.
They just wear tiny shoes.



TL;DR

Returned a ring I found in a club bathroom instead of selling it. That single decent choice spiraled into a friend group where: one guy got sober, one opened a bakery, two friends got married, and I somehow became a writer. Separately (but thematically), I once sent a flirty voice note to the building group chat by accident; my boss forwarded it to shame me, HR guy defended me, boss got fired, HR guy became my husband. Also a “leave at door” delivery toggle + wrong label roll caused a wedding cake to say CONGRATS ON THE DIVORCE and briefly set the internet on fire. Life is a timeline of tiny buttons and I hate it here (affectionate).

I've been considering buying a small super automatic to complement my pour over setup for when I don't have time or patience to brew myself, and also for when my wife wants a coffee and I'm not around to help her with it.

I'm more of a coffee-only person, but my wife likes milk drinks and I appreciate a cappuccino from time to time. I've been looking at some options with integrated milk systems like with the hose that you can put into the milk carton, but I have some past trauma from seeing these components caked up with old milk in my grandmas old machine. Milk drinks at a touch sounds good, but having to clean these small plastic parts regularly seems to defeat the purpose of the convenience of these machines.

*Mining is cool again in the US – along with building an international alliance to thwart the Asian giant’s dominance of critical minerals.*

[Madeline King Washington visit: Donald Trump’s plan for critical minerals](https://www.afr.com/opinion/us-wants-global-co-operation-to-counter-china-on-critical-minerals-20260205-p5nzyg)

[US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosts ministers, including Madeleine King \(back row\) at the US critical minerals summit. King described last week’s Washington meeting as “a remarkable gathering”. AP](https://preview.redd.it/xgeszfvdxuhg1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfae3fcee3d75f79be71b15532b5d24afb3b6de4)

That problem is China’s effective control of the supply chain for many critical minerals, including procuring and processing. That also translates into Chinese dominance, built up over decades, in those rare earths elements fundamental to much of modern technology.

Countering that control will require what Rubio calls a “network” of countries to create a reliable alternative supply.

“We want to serve as the convener, but this is a global challenge,” Rubio declared. “Everyone wants to advance industrially and technologically. Everyone wants to be able to defend their national security.

“Whether it’s a cell phone, a computer, a semiconductor facility, or the weapons that protect your country – all of these things have to have built components. And these components invariably involve critical minerals that don’t just have to be mined, they have to be processed.”

Even [Vice President JD Vance](https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/vance-rubio-pitch-critical-mineral-price-floors-to-counter-china-20260205-p5nzpe) reversed his more typical MAGA rhetoric about the failings of countries other than the US.

**“This is something where our alliances and our friendships can really help one another,” he said. “We’re all on the same team; we’re all rowing in the same direction.”**

That claim might come as a shock to many of America’s erstwhile allies in Europe, Latin America or Asia more accustomed over the past year to being dismissed as irrelevant or punished for “unfair” trade practices and standing in the way of America’s national interest.

Australia, by contrast, manoeuvred through the first year of the Trump presidency with little damage to the bilateral relationship. This has been in part due to this country’s enthusiastic promotion of its resources wealth and its willingness to work with the US on developing that. Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump signed a critical minerals agreement in Washington last October, for example, including a shared commitment to invest billions of dollars in various projects.

Madeleine King still describes last week’s Washington meeting as “a remarkable gathering.

“It is really important that the US is initiating and engaging in a multilateral discussion to deal with this issue,” she said. “It does demonstrate that a lot of countries are moving in the same direction.”

The risks of China’s ability to control the market were spectacularly obvious after Beijing weaponised the vital supply of rare earths and processed metals and magnets by restricting access or banning certain exports. The damaging impact on American manufacturing was a key reason Donald Trump backed off from imposing even higher trade tariffs on China last year.

But China has also spent decades manipulating prices and regularly flooding markets, particularly in rare earths, to kill off potential competition by making such investments seem too financially risky. At the same time, China consolidated its unparalleled technical expertise in processing raw materials into metals and magnets.

“Once they control that industry and they’re the only ones in the world that do it, then they can charge you anything they want, but they can also use it against you as leverage, or it could be disrupted if there was any sort of global disruption and so forth,” Rubio told the gathering. “This is not a sustainable situation.”

There was a certain irony in Washington’s focus on critical minerals in the same week that shares of many US tech giants fell on fears of massive economic disruption created by the constant advance of artificial intelligence.

It’s another indication that mining jobs – as well as manufacturing ones – are cool again in the Trump era. The White House wants to reduce the average 29 years it takes to build a mine in America, an aim BHP and Rio Tinto can only hope is realized given their joint copper mine in Arizona.

“I think this is a broader mistake made by the industrialized and developed world,” Rubio said. “We all sort of fell in love with the design of these things, but forgot that in order to design something, you have to be able to build it, and in order to build it you have to have the fundamental materials necessary to make it with.

**“That’s the key goal of critical minerals supply, and today it’s heavily concentrated in the hands of one country.”**

[How this key goal will play out](https://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/investors-pile-into-asx-listed-rare-earths-amid-trump-stockpile-plan-20260203-p5nz38) across the rest of the world remains vague.

The latest American domestic initiative, for example, is [Project Vault](https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/trump-to-launch-17b-critical-minerals-stockpile-20260203-p5nz05) – a proposed stockpile of $US12 billion ($17 billion) worth of critical minerals designed to help American manufacturers avoid future supply shortages and price volatility.

Some $US10 billion will come in the form of loans, guarantees and investments from the US Export-Import Bank with another almost $US2 billion worth of funding from corporate America.

But the US is also promoting the need for other countries to co-ordinate non-Chinese supplies and use strategies like guaranteed price floors, preferential trade zones and regulatory standards.

**Yet another acronym was launched in Washington – the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement – to be known as FORGE.**

[Why breaking China's critical minerals monopoly costs more than money | Invezz](https://invezz.com/news/2026/02/05/why-breaking-china-s-critical-minerals-monopoly-costs-more-than-money/)

https://preview.redd.it/5h4cls99yuhg1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a782dbf576b7787efd006d3df10acb9920f7bed

* **Project Vault builds a $12 billion strategic reserve for civilian industry.**
* **China controls 87 percent of global critical mineral refining and processing capacity.**
* **Recycling old electronic technology helps create a sustainable closed-loop supply chain.**

For the past 30 years, the West prioritized “cheap and fast,” effectively outsourcing the messy, toxic, and complex work of mineral refining to China.

Meanwhile, China played the long game. The result is a world where the transition to artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and advanced defense systems currently requires permission from a single supplier.

But this is not just a trade dispute over rocks and soil.

As of February 2026, this event could be the most aggressive reorganization of the global industrial order since the Cold War.

# Why the refinement game is rigged

Most people think the struggle for China’s critical minerals is about who has the biggest holes in the ground, although the reality is much more technical.

While copper and lithium are found in plenty of places, [China controls about 87% of the global processing and refining capacity](https://www.aiddata.org/blog/new-aiddata-report-dataset-track-chinas-investments-in-critical-minerals).

China essentially acts as the world’s chemist by taking raw rocks from places like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and turning them into the specialized powders needed for advanced manufacturing.

This dominance is the result of a 30-year head start, where the West was happy to let China handle the environmental and energy costs of heavy processing.  
Because they also[ manufacture 93% of high-strength rare-earth permanent magnets](https://www.woodmac.com/news/can-the-rest-of-the-world-repel-chinas-magnetic-pull-over-rare-earth-metals), they hold a total monopoly on the parts that make wind turbines spin and precision missiles fly.

The dependency is now a major security headache because the US is 100% import-reliant for 15 specific minerals, and at least 70% of rare earth shipments come from China.

Beijing used this as leverage in 2025 by placing export controls on seven types of rare earths in response to American trade tariffs.

They even introduced plans for “long-arm” jurisdiction to regulate products traded worldwide that contain even minimal Chinese content.

By controlling 100% of the refined production for heavy rare earths like dysprosium, China can essentially decide which foreign industries get to finish their high-tech products and which ones are left waiting on a license.

This level of control allows them to strategically use niche materials like gallium and germanium to bring rivals back to the negotiating table.

# Project Vault and the 12 billion dollar bet

In early February 2026, the US government decided to stop playing defense and [launched a program called Project Vault](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/introducing-project-vault-a-critical-mineral-stockpile-for-american-businesses-%F0%9F%92%8E%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%B8/).

This initiative is an attempt to build a massive safety net for the civilian economy using a $10 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank and nearly $1.67 billion from private investors.

Unlike previous stockpiles that were only for the military, this reserve is designed to keep factories for companies like GM and Boeing running if supply lines get cut.

It represents a major change in American economic policy because it puts the government directly into the business of managing mineral markets.

The administration hopes that by holding a massive inventory of rare earths, it can prevent the kind of price spikes that happen when Beijing decides to limit exports.

# The price floor standoff with allies

During the[ Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington this week](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/2/4/trumps-critical-minerals-meet-whos-attending-whats-at-stake), over 50 countries gathered to discuss how to keep their own mining companies from going bankrupt.

Many nations, like Australia, are pushing for a global price floor because they are tired of seeing China flood the market with cheap materials whenever a Western competitor opens a new mine.

While a guaranteed minimum price would protect investors, the US has been hesitant to fully commit to the idea.

If the West cannot agree on a pricing mechanism, it will be very difficult to convince private banks to fund new mines that might take a decade to start turning a profit.

This creates a situation where the desire for security is hitting a wall of traditional market economics.

# Geopolitical pivots to the North and South

The search for alternatives to Chinese routes is leading the Pentagon to some very unconventional partners.

There are reports that US officials are looking toward the Venezuelan Mining Corporation to secure minerals like tantalum, which is required for high-end electronics.

At the same time, the prospect of mining in Greenland remains a major topic of discussion despite the diplomatic friction it causes with Denmark.

Even if the US manages to find these minerals in the Western Hemisphere, they still face the problem of where to process them without sending them back to China.

Every new mining deal now requires a massive parallel investment in chemical plants that do not yet exist on American soil.

# The hidden value in American scrap heaps

While everyone is looking for new places to dig, [a company in Michigan called Cirba Solutions is proving that the next big mine might be in people’s junk drawers](https://www.michiganpublic.org/politics-government/2026-02-03/how-recycling-might-help-the-us-break-chinas-grip-on-critical-minerals).

They use a chemical process to break down old lithium-ion batteries into a substance called black mass, which contains the cobalt and nickel needed for new tech.

This kind of recycling could eventually create a closed-loop system where we use the same minerals over and over again.

Although recycling cannot replace mining entirely, it is becoming a vital part of the plan to reduce the need for new imports from overseas.

The legislation known as the Unearth America’s Future Act is now trying to use tax breaks to make this kind of “urban mining” more profitable for US companies.

# A high price for a new industrial map

The real insight for anyone watching these markets is that the era of “cheap tech” is likely coming to an end. We are watching the global economy split into two separate systems, where the West is willing to pay a premium for minerals that are not sourced from China.

This security premium will eventually show up in the price of everything from a laptop to a home battery system.

China still holds the advantage of having thousands of patents and a workforce that has been refining these materials for three decades.

While the $12 billion dollar “Project Vault” is a massive step, it is only a fraction of what China spends annually to keep its lead.

**The successful investors will be the ones who realize that the mineral war is now a permanent feature of the industrial landscape rather than a temporary trade spat.**

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[Project Vault is the demand backstop, FORGE is the global alliance framework, and EXIM is the financing weapon to actually get it built. That’s the whole point: a fully domestic, fully integrated U.S. critical minerals platform that can’t be price-killed, sanction-choked, or outsourced back to China.](https://reddit.com/link/1qxgbt2/video/0o4bse1cbvhg1/player)

# 🌍 FORGE Is the World Finally Saying “Enough” — and Building the Anti-China Minerals Alliance

This week in Washington wasn’t a conference — it was a global admission of failure, followed immediately by a global pivot. Rubio basically laid it out like a war map: the problem isn’t who has the biggest hole in the ground… the problem is China built the refinery machine, the magnet machine, and the processing machine — and the West spent 30 years pretending that didn’t matter because “cheap and fast” felt good.

Now reality has arrived. China doesn’t just sell minerals — **China controls permission.** Permission for EV motors, missiles, semiconductors, drones, wind turbines, data centers, and every “AI future” fantasy people are pumping billions into. Because guess what? None of it runs on vibes. It runs on **processed materials** — powders, oxides, metals, alloys, magnet-grade inputs — and China dominates that pipeline like a choke chain.

So the U.S. just fired back with the first real counter-move in decades: **Project Vault.** A $12B strategic reserve designed for CIVILIAN industry — not just the Pentagon. That’s a massive signal. It means Washington is preparing for the day the supply gets cut and factories can’t stop. It also means the government is done “hoping markets behave.” They’re building a floor, a buffer, and a demand engine — because they finally understand you can’t finance new mines and refineries if China can dump prices anytime it wants.

Then came FORGE — and this is the big one. FORGE is basically the U.S. saying: *“If you can mine it, refine it, manufacture it, or finance it — you belong in the coalition.”* It’s the blueprint for a minerals NATO / OPEC-style bloc where allied nations stop undercutting each other and start undercutting coercion. And judging by the turnout — India, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Europe, South America, Middle East players — the world is clearly ready. Not because they love America. Because they’re tired of being held hostage by one supplier.

And here’s the part Wall Street still doesn’t get: this is not a “trade headline.” This is a structural rewrite of the global industrial order. It’s why the market is freaking out, why ETFs are puking shares, why stocks are whipping around like penny scams. Traders hate anything that smells like price floors, tariffs, or national strategy. But Washington isn’t trading this — **Washington is building it.** The market can tantrum all it wants. The policy machine has already moved.

The winners in this new world will be the projects that can actually deliver inside the coalition: **domestic production + domestic processing + scale + timeline + financing readiness.** That’s why NioCorp being in D.C. right now matters. Because when EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes start talking “Project Vault,” they’re not shopping for a dream — they’re shopping for the kind of integrated U.S. supply platform that can anchor multiple chains at once.

Bottom line: **FORGE is the opening move of the free world’s mineral counteroffensive.** The era of “cheap China inputs forever” is ending. The era of allied minerals security is starting. And the projects that fit this architecture won’t just survive — they’ll become the backbone of the next industrial century.

[And this is exactly why NioCorp is in D.C. near the rooms where this is being built — because Elk Creek isn’t just “a mine,” it’s the kind of fully integrated U.S. supply platform Project Vault and FORGE were designed to pull forward.](https://reddit.com/link/1qxgbt2/video/8rvqxjax8vhg1/player)

And this is exactly why **NioCorp is in D.C. near the rooms where this is being built** — because Elk Creek isn’t just “a mine,” it’s the kind of **fully integrated U.S. supply platform** Project Vault and FORGE were designed to pull forward.

Mark Smith has been unambiguous: **“2026 is the year.”** Not as hype — as sequencing. February is ScAl validation with DoD/Lockheed. March is a DFS built for financiers and offtakers. Mid-2026 is the EXIM FID window. And now Project Vault drops with EXIM + Tier-1 industrial seed capital + Traxys — the same Traxys that locked in early with NioCorp years ago — meaning the *market-making and offtake plumbing* is already being assembled in real time. Smith has said it plainly: the Elk Creek Project is positioned as a **“national strategic asset”** — and with Washington now building price floors, reserves, and a global minerals coalition, the catalysts aren’t theoretical anymore. The U.S. is openly declaring minerals sovereignty a national priority… and Elk Creek is one of the only projects architected to deliver **SEVEN critical minerals from ore → oxides → metals → alloys → magnet-grade materials → components** on U.S. soil.

**This** is no longer just a mining project — it’s a national security buildout.

1qxg98z,https://i.redd.it/ah5314m4bvhg1.jpeg,Is it wrong to use Hinge while having a boyfriend?(Asking for a friend),"I’m asking because my best friend has been in a relationship for about 3 months now. They’re officially boyfriend and girlfriend, not just “talking.”
The issue is she still uses Hinge and actively goes on dates with other guys. She meets them for coffee, dinner, sometimes drinks — she calls them “first dates only.” She says as long as she doesn’t sleep with them or emotionally invest, it’s not cheating.
Her logic is that the relationship is still early, exclusivity was never discussed in detail, and dating apps are just a way to see what’s out there. She also says if she finds someone she connects with more, she’d end things with her boyfriend first — so in her mind she’s being fair.
What makes me uncomfortable is that her boyfriend has no idea she’s doing this and genuinely thinks they’re exclusive. She argues that exclusivity should be explicitly stated, not assumed, and that modern dating works differently now.
I can’t tell if this is actually wrong, or if I’m just stuck on old ideas of commitment. Is this cheating, or just how dating works now?",1,1770380824.0,TeensofMaharashtra,5,1.0,False

She’s been with her boyfriend ""Evan"" (30M) for about 4 years and they’re the kind of couple everyone assumes will get married eventually. I’m also friends with Evan, not super close like I’m texting him memes, but we’ve hung out a lot as a group and I genuinely like him. Maya and I are closer. She tells me everything, or at least she used to. Two weeks ago she called me late at night, crying, and asked me to come over. When I got there she was shaky and kept repeating ""I messed up, I messed up."" I thought something terrible happened. Then she told me she cheated on Evan. She had been at a work conference out of town, went out for drinks with a few people, and ended up back in someone’s hotel room. She said it wasn’t planned, she was drunk, she felt lonely, she wanted attention, all the usual stuff people say when they’re trying to explain a choice they regret. She told me she woke up the next morning feeling sick, like she couldn’t breathe, and she’s been spiraling since. I asked if she was going to tell Evan. She said no, absolutely not, it would ""destroy him"" and ""destroy us"" and it would be pointless because it was a one time thing. Then she looked me dead in the face and said she needed me to promise I wouldn’t say anything. Like, not ""please"", more like a demand wrapped in tears. I didn’t promise. I said I couldn’t be part of that, and she started panicking harder and said I was her best friend, I’m supposed to be loyal, and Evan would never have to know. She kept saying she would fix it by being a better girlfriend, and that telling him would only be for her guilt, not for him. She also said if I told, I would be ruining her life, because Evan would leave and everyone would pick sides. I told her I needed time to think, and I went home feeling gross, like my skin didn’t fit. For the next two days she bombarded me with messages. Some were pleading, some were angry, some were like ""I thought you loved me"" and then a heart emoji, then ten minutes later ""Don’t you dare."" She even asked me to lie if Evan ever asked why she was acting weird. Meanwhile I kept thinking about Evan sitting across from us at brunch last month talking about looking at rings ""someday"", all excited, and I felt like I was carrying a rock in my chest. I’m not proud of this, but I started avoiding both of them because I didn’t know how to look at him without hearing her voice in my head. Eventually Evan noticed something was off and texted me asking if Maya was mad at him because she was being distant and snappy. I stared at that text for a long time. I called Maya and told her Evan had asked, and that she needs to tell him. She screamed at me that I was trying to force her into a confession and that I was being cruel. She said I wasn’t there, I don’t understand, and I was acting morally superior. That night I met Evan for coffee and I told him. I didn’t go into graphic details, I just told him the truth and that I couldn’t keep it from him. His face went blank in a way that scared me, like he turned into a statue. He thanked me in this quiet voice and left. After that, Maya called me about 20 times, then sent a message saying I’m dead to her and I always secretly hated her. Mutual friends are now texting me ""why would you get involved"" and ""that wasn’t your secret to tell"" which is making me second guess myself. I know cheating is wrong, but am I wrong for telling him instead of giving her more time, even though she begged me not to?

Main tools I'd like to have a smooth experience with are After Effects, Blender, Davinci Resolve, Cinema 4D, PS, Illustrator.. I'm not too bothered by the render time, I can go make a coffee or something while it renders, most important thing is to have a smooth experience while working, playback/viewport speed etc

Gaming is secondary, not an avid gamer, casual enjoyer of a select few AAA games, RDR2, Alan Wake 2, Stalker 2, If a build gets me a consistent 60 fps in these games at 1440p then I'd consider that a fun time.

My budget is tight, and there are not many builds/options I can pick from, been scouring the online shops where I'm from and I narrowed it down to these few builds, so I'd like to hear your thoughts before making the purchase:

* R5 5600X + 16gb ddr4 + RTX 5050 + nvme 1TB  = $760
* R5 5600X + 16gb ddr4 + RTX 5060 + SSD 512 = $940
* R5 5600X + 16gb ddr4 + RX 9060xt 16GB + 512 ssd = $980

I'd like to consider price to performance ratio, if the cheaper build can get me somewhere decent with those tools compared with the others then that's probably the best option for me.

I know the smartest thing is to save up and buy a beefier system, but tbh I already missed out on buying a build before ram prices went crazy, and I'm worried it will only get worse from here, so I'd like to get something now rather than overpay again later for a worse build.

I will increase RAM as well at a later point so keep that in mind.",1,1770380503.0,buildapc,0,1.0,False

1qxg4eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qxg4eu/how_to_make_small_talk_people_actually_enjoy_the/,How to Make Small Talk People Actually Enjoy: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Small talk gets a bad rap. Most of us would rather wrestle a bear than stand in an elevator making weather commentary with Karen from accounting. But here's the thing, after diving deep into communication research, psychology podcasts, and interviewing actual charismatic people (not just reading about them), I realized we've been doing it completely wrong.

The problem isn't small talk itself. It's that we treat it like a checklist instead of actual human connection. We're so focused on ""what do I say next?"" that we forget the other person is also probably uncomfortable and would love for someone to make this less painful.

Here's what actually works:

**Drop the script mentality.** Most communication books teach you generic openers like ""how was your weekend?"" which everyone asks. Instead, try noticing something specific about the situation you're both in. Stuck in a long grocery line? ""I always pick the slowest line, it's like a superpower."" Waiting for a meeting? ""These chairs are wildly uncomfortable, right?"" You're not trying to be profound, just acknowledging shared reality.

The book **[""How to Talk to Anyone""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35210.How_to_Talk_to_Anyone) by Leil Lowndes** changed my entire approach to this. Lowndes is a communication expert who's coached everyone from Fortune 500 execs to shy introverts, and her techniques are stupidly practical. She breaks down exactly how charismatic people make others feel heard without any of that cringe ""networking"" energy. The chapter on ""flooding smiles"" alone is worth it. Best communication book I've read, hands down.

**Ask questions that require more than yes/no answers.** Instead of ""did you have a good weekend?"" try ""what did you end up doing this weekend?"" The first one shuts down conversation. The second one opens a door. If they went hiking, you can ask what trail. If they stayed home, you can relate to that too. You're giving them options to share as much or as little as they want.

**The 70/30 rule is magic.** Let them talk 70% of the time, you talk 30%. Most people love talking about themselves (it's biology, not narcissism), so lean into that. When they share something, ask a follow up question before jumping to your own story. ""Oh you're learning guitar? What made you want to pick that up?"" This makes people feel interesting, which makes them associate you with positive feelings.

The [**Huberman Lab podcast**](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast) has an incredible episode on social connection and why small talk actually matters for our nervous system. Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) explains how brief positive social interactions literally regulate our stress hormones. Even 30 seconds of pleasant small talk can shift your entire physiological state. Made me way less resentful of these interactions once I understood the science.

**Find the ""third thing.""** This is from improv comedy. Instead of focusing on you or them, focus on something external you're both observing or experiencing. The weird art in the waiting room. The aggressive air conditioning. The fact that this coffee tastes like burnt rubber. It removes pressure because you're both on the same team commenting on the world, not interrogating each other.

**Use the ""callback"" technique.** If someone mentions they're training for a half marathon, and you see them a week later, ask how the training is going. People are shocked when you remember details about their life. It signals ""you matter enough for me to retain information about you"" without being creepy. I track this stuff loosely in my phone notes after networking events.

For anyone wanting to go deeper on conversation skills without committing to heavy reading, [**BeFreed**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) pulls together insights from communication experts, psychology research, and real social dynamics books into personalized audio learning. 

The app is built by a team from Columbia and Google, and it's designed specifically for goals like ""become better at small talk as someone with social anxiety."" You can set how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with tons of examples and context. It also builds you a custom learning plan based on your specific struggles and adjusts as you progress. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, everything from calm and informative to a smoky, conversational style that makes the content way more engaging during commutes or workouts.

**Exit gracefully.** Nothing makes small talk worse than not knowing how to end it. Try ""it was really nice chatting with you"" or ""I should let you get back to it"" or even just ""well, I'll let you go."" You don't need an elaborate excuse. Brief, polite, done.

**Practice with low stakes interactions.** Baristas, uber drivers, people in line. These are perfect because you'll never see them again, so who cares if it's awkward? I started challenging myself to have one ""real"" exchange per day with a stranger. Most people are genuinely surprised when someone talks to them like a human instead of a transaction.

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: small talk is a skill, and like any skill, it requires practice. You're going to be bad at it before you're good at it. You're going to have awkward pauses and weird segues. That's fine. The people who are ""naturally good"" at conversation have just had more reps than you.

Small talk isn't about being fake or filling silence. It's about acknowledging that we're all humans navigating this bizarre social world together, and sometimes a 90 second conversation about nothing can make both people's days slightly less lonely. That's not nothing.",1,1770380432.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

**Best for:** Creative friends, deep conversations, weekend brunches, relaxed vibes

If Pune had a soul, it would probably be sipping filter coffee somewhere in Koregaon Park. This neighbourhood has evolved into the beating heart of Pune's cafe culture, creative community, and genuinely cool hangout scene.

**Why friends love it:**

Koregaon Park isn't trying too hard. The cafes here understand that good hangouts need three things: comfortable seating, decent WiFi (for when you need to settle debates), and staff who don't rush you out after an hour.

German Bakery remains iconic for a reason—it's where solo travelers become friends, where college projects turn into genuine bonds, and where conversations flow as smoothly as their smoothies. The vibe is international yet unmistakably Pune. You'll find tabla players jamming next to laptop programmers, artists sketching while friends debate philosophy, and groups of friends who've been meeting here every Sunday for years.

**The real spots to try:**

**Arthur's Theme** has that rare quality of feeling both sophisticated and welcoming. It's perfect for the kind of friends' meetup where you want good food, better conversations, and an ambience that doesn't force you to shout.

**Malaka Spice** works brilliantly for larger friend groups—the Asian fusion menu gives everyone something to enjoy, and the garden seating makes those long, meandering conversations feel natural.

**Shisha Jazz Café** is where Pune's night owls gather. Live music, comfortable seating, and an atmosphere that encourages you to stay past midnight discussing everything from career anxieties to childhood dreams.

**Pro insider tip:** Visit on weekday afternoons if you want peaceful conversations. Weekends get crowded, but that's also when you'll feel the full energy of Pune's social scene. The area is walkable—park once and explore multiple spots in one hangout session.

**Budget reality check:** ₹400-800 per person depending on where you go and how hungry you are. Cafes like German Bakery are more affordable; restaurants like Malaka Spice will push you higher.",1,1770380342.0,strangermingle,0,1.0,False

1qxg2b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feedspace/comments/1qxg2b3/your_brain_judges_brands_by_one_thing_and_its_not/,Your brain judges brands by one thing (and It’s not the product),"Most people have done this without realizing it.

A negative review shows up.  
Scrolling starts- not to read more reviews, but to check **whether the brand replied**.

No response.

And suddenly:

* Trust drops
* Interest fades
* The tab gets closed

No conscious decision. No comparison. Just a quiet “nope.”

That silence feels like an answer, even though logically, it isn’t.

**Silence Isn’t Neutral. It’s a Penalty.**

Here’s the uncomfortable data:

* Businesses that respond to at least **25% of reviews earn -35% more revenue**
* One study showed an **80% increase in conversions** simply by replying more often

Same product. Same pricing. Same traffic.  
The only difference? One brand talked back. One didn’t.

Why it works:  
The human brain treats silence like social rejection.  
For thousands of years, being ignored by the group meant danger.

That wiring still fires,even while scrolling Google reviews at 11pm.

**Reviews Aren’t Being Read. They’re Being Watched.**

Reviews aren’t about the product.

They’re about behavior.

Someone complains- does the brand respond or disappear?  
Someone praises - do they acknowledge it or ghost?

This is a live audition.  
And negative reviews are where character shows.

Nearly **45% of consumers are more likely to visit a business that responds to negative reviews -** not positive ones.

Because problems happen.  
Handling them is what matters.

**The Domino’s Move That Changed Everything**

In the late 2000s, Domino’s was getting destroyed online.

Instead of staying quiet, executives read the **worst reviews out loud** in ads:

* “The crust tastes like cardboard”
* “Worst pizza ever”

Then they said: *You’re right. We’re fixing it.*

They rebuilt the recipe publicly. Documented the process. Showed the results.

Sales jumped. Trust returned.  
Silence would’ve killed the brand. Transparency rebuilt it.

**The Conversion Math Nobody Talks About**

Some numbers worth sitting with:

* 53% of customers expect a response to negative reviews within a week
* 87% of businesses don’t meet that expectation
* 63% of customers will update a negative review if the issue is fixed
* Negative reviews **with good responses convert better** than positive reviews with no response

Why?

Because issues are expected.  
Silence isn’t.

A response says: *“If something goes wrong, it’ll be handled.”*

**One Tweet. Eight Hours. Massive Damage.**

In 2013, British Airways lost a customer’s luggage.

The customer promoted a tweet saying:

>""Don’t fly @ BritishAirways. Their customer service is horrendous.”

British Airways stayed silent for **8 hours**.

In that time:

* 76,000 people saw it
* International media picked it up
* It became a global PR case study

The luggage wasn’t the problem.  
The silence was.

Meanwhile, JetBlue made fast, human responses part of its brand and became one of the most trusted airlines on social media.

Same industry. Very different outcomes.

The “Real Human” Signal

The brain is scanning for one thing:

*Is there a person behind this brand?*

A reply like:

>“You’re right, mornings have been chaotic. Two new baristas start Monday.”

That’s not corporate messaging.  
That’s accountability.

And accountability feels safe.

A brand with hundreds of reviews and zero replies feels automated even if the product is great.

**The Ripple Effect Nobody Sees**

When a brand replies to one review, it’s not just for that person.

It’s for:

* Everyone scrolling later
* Every future buyer
* Every silent observer

La Colombe Coffee turned a single customer review into marketing copy and now uses reviews across ads, emails, and product pages.

Reviews aren’t static.  
They’re conversations.  
And conversations convert.

**The Bottom Line**

People care when brands respond, even to reviews written by strangers.

Not because expectations are high.  
Because the brain is checking for safety.

A response says *“Someone’s here.”*  
Silence says *“Maybe not.”*

That wiring isn’t changing.

Brands that understand this will win quietly.  
Brands that stay silent will keep wondering why conversions are slipping.",1,1770380256.0,Feedspace,0,1.0,False
1qxg1p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1qxg1p1/finally_unlocked_my_chaotic_curator_vibe/,Finally unlocked my chaotic curator vibe: Experimenting with thrifted textures & '90s alt liner hacks for my literary gothic reverie 🦇 (It's all about embracing the happy accidents!),"Okay, real talk for a sec: I love those dramatic, avant-garde looks you see floating around the alt beauty sphere – the ones that look like they belong on a runway or in a high-concept art piece. But let's be honest, trying to recreate a full-on gothic cathedral eye or a chaotic curator lip art for a Tuesday morning coffee run? Not exactly practical. My latest little experiment was all about taking that dramatic inspiration and distilling it down into something that still feels *me*, still feels distinctly alt, but doesn't require an hour, a professional lighting rig, or the confidence of a supermodel. Specifically, I was aiming for a **'90s alt vibe** with a subtle **literary gothic** edge that wouldn't scare my barista.

Here's the breakdown of what actually went down:

*   **The Vibe:** My goal was a **simplified '90s alt eye** with a touch of literary gothic depth, paired with a soft, smudged lip. Think less 'band frontwoman' and more 'introverted art student who secretly writes poetry.'
*   **Eye Technique: The ""Smudged-Out Storyteller"" Eye**
    *   **Product 1:** **NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in ""Black Bean""** (around $5-$8). This is my absolute go-to for a quick, impactful base.
    *   **Application:** Instead of drawing a precise line, I just scribbled it generously along my upper lash line and into the crease, then quickly, and I mean *quickly*, blended it out with a dense flat brush (a cheap one from an e.l.f. set works wonders). The key here is speed before it sets!
    *   **Product 2:** **ColourPop ""Smoke Show"" palette**, specifically the deep grey matte shade ""Stone Face"" (the palette is usually $18-$22, but I grabbed it on sale for less).
    *   **Application:** Lightly patted this shade *over* the smudged NYX pencil, focusing on the outer corner and blending slightly upwards and outwards to create a soft, smoky wing shape without needing a sharp liner. This helped set the pencil and added a velvety texture.
    *   **Product 3:** A touch of **Maybelline Colossal Curl Bounce Mascara** ($8-$12) on curled lashes. Nothing too dramatic, just enough to frame the eye.
*   **Lip Technique: The ""Just Bit a Berry"" Stain**
    *   **Product 1:** **Milani Color Fetish Matte Lipstick in ""Fling""** (a deep, muted berry-brown, around $8-$10).
    *   **Application:** Applied directly to the center of my lips, then gently blotted and smudged outwards with my ring finger to create a diffused, ""just eaten a plum"" look. No harsh lines, just a suggestion of color.
*   **Base & Brows:** Kept it super simple. Just a bit of **L'Oréal True Match Super-Blendable Concealer** ($8-$10) where needed, and brushed up my brows with a clear gel. No heavy foundation, letting skin texture show through.
*   **Time Invested:** Honestly? About **10-12 minutes** for the whole face once I got the hang of it. Perfect for when you want to feel put-together but don't have ages.

Now, let's get real about the journey to this 'aha!' moment. My first attempt? Well, let's just say I looked less 'poetic loner' and more 'slept in my makeup.' I initially tried to build up too much black shadow, making it look heavy and muddy instead of softly smoky. I also tried a more precise liner, which completely killed the relaxed '90s vibe I was going for. The blending with the NYX pencil was surprisingly tricky at first – if you don't move fast enough, it becomes immovable, which is great for longevity but terrible for smudging!

The biggest surprise was how much *less* product I needed than I thought. A little bit of the NYX pencil, blended quickly, created a much more impactful yet wearable look than layers of powder shadow. And that smudged lip? It's so much more forgiving than a crisp line, especially when you're running out the door. It taught me that sometimes, simplifying a technique or using fewer steps can actually *enhance* the alternative aesthetic, making it feel more lived-in and authentic, rather than sacrificing it. It's not about being 'flawless,' but about finding what feels right and looks cool without being a huge production.

6 AM dog walk in 45°F wind. Jacket laughed. Zipper stiff AF day one—smooth by day three. White swoosh survived rain + coffee splash. Feels like I stole my cool uncle’s closet.

Thigh pocket swallowed phone + keys + AirPods. Zero sag. Olive green hid my morning coffee disaster like magic. Park dude squinted: “Those pockets actually work?” Bro. They do.



nike tech fleece hoodie

Layered over another hoodie (yes, really). Zero static cling. Hood = cozy cave. Flat-stitched tag? No itch. Felt like I spent $ 200. Cost less than my lunch. Mood unlocked.



nike tech fleece pants

Napped cross-country in these. Woke up wrinkle-free. Waistband didn’t dig after airport pizza. Flight attendant: “You look… suspiciously comfortable.” I winked. We both knew.

Full black = instant villain arc. Zipper silent. Cuffs hugged ankles without cutting circulation. Barista smirked: “Heist crew?” I nodded. She slid my coffee over. Respect.

1qxfy3k,https://i.redd.it/kwcfysad8vhg1.jpeg,Is it wrong to use Hinge while having a boyfriend?,"I’m asking because my best friend has been in a relationship for about 3 months now. They’re officially boyfriend and girlfriend, not just “talking.”
The issue is she still uses Hinge and actively goes on dates with other guys. She meets them for coffee, dinner, sometimes drinks — she calls them “first dates only.” She says as long as she doesn’t sleep with them or emotionally invest, it’s not cheating.
Her logic is that the relationship is still early, exclusivity was never discussed in detail, and dating apps are just a way to see what’s out there. She also says if she finds someone she connects with more, she’d end things with her boyfriend first — so in her mind she’s being fair.
What makes me uncomfortable is that her boyfriend has no idea she’s doing this and genuinely thinks they’re exclusive. She argues that exclusivity should be explicitly stated, not assumed, and that modern dating works differently now.
I can’t tell if this is actually wrong, or if I’m just stuck on old ideas of commitment. Is this cheating, or just how dating works now?",0,1770379896.0,TeenIndia,16,0.33,False

1qxfx51,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1qxfx51/testing_a_phonefree_setup_for_navigating_new/,"Testing a ""Phone-Free"" setup for navigating new cities (Audio vs. Screen)","As someone who moves cities often, the ""first week""  is basically constantly staring at Google Maps and Translate apps while trying to find a grocery store or a coworking space makes me feel like a walking target for pickpockets and keeps me in a ""tourist"" headspace.

I recently tried to solve this by moving my navigation and basic interactions to Audio-only using hands free smart glasses with translation capabilities . After a full weekend of testing in a city where I don't speak the language, here’s the breakdown for anyone looking to optimize their travel setup:

The Efficiency Wins:

• Blending In: Being able to hear directions via voice while keeping my head up made me look like I knew where I was going. It’s a massive upgrade for situational awareness in busy hubs.

• The ""Human"" Factor: Hearing a translation in real-time while maintaining eye contact with a local shopkeeper or landlord felt way less awkward than the ""stare at the phone and show the screen"" routine.

• Battery Life: Surprisingly, I didn't have to charge the glasses (Dymesty) all weekend. For a nomad, having one less thing to plug into a power bank mid-day is a win.

• Low Profile: Since there’s no camera, I didn't get any ""creepy tech"" vibes from people in cafes or co-working spaces.

The Reality Check:

• Audio Quality: These are for utility, not leisure. Voices are clear, but don't bother trying to enjoy a high-fidelity playlist on them.

• Ambient Noise: In heavy traffic or construction zones, the bone conduction/open-ear audio struggles. I still had to pull out my phone a couple of times for complex map intersections.

• Translation Nuance: It’s great for ""where is the bathroom"" or ordering coffee, but I wouldn't use it for a high-stakes contract negotiation.

The Verdict: For me, reducing the friction between ""me"" and the ""environment"" is the goal. Keeping the phone in my pocket actually helped me ""land"" in the new city faster mentally.

Does anyone else use audio or AR wearable tech to streamline their navigation in a foreign country, or are you still sticking to the phone?",4,1770379812.0,digitalnomad,2,1.0,False

Last time I met him a few years back he was really nice, complimented my costume (last minute Filoni, cowboy hat, black button up shirt). Anyway this time I dressed up as him again and he wasn’t very chill. Called me a bunch of slurs I dont feel comfortable repeating. Said stuff like “I run the darn universe now you little \*f-slur\*” and he kept giggling and tickling me. 

Whatever, he’s got a new promotion so I let him be. But when I was leaving he found me in the car park and kept spitting on me, he made me give him my filoni hat and the he put it on his head and was like “imagine these are your mums tits hehehe” and was rubbing them and shit then the hats fell off his head and I could tell he was upset, he started tearing up so I helped him back to his van and let him have my hat. I thought we were chill again because he said “thank yee” and put his hand on my thigh. I kind of hurried off and yeah he uses r-slur again etc. etc. 

so that was a week ago and I’ve seen him 9 times since. He keeps showing up at my work (cafe) wearing different hats and calling himself different names on his order like Clave Feelhorni, Days forhehe, Dave’s uncut Forskini (trying to disguise himself I guess) and he’ll order a coffee and send it back with some bullshit excuse e.g. wrong milk, too much sugar. He told my colleague that I’m a liar and he would never come onto me but honestly I hadn’t even told anyone. I’m a 48 year old man btw

We walked for a bit without deciding where we were going.

That’s not entirely true. I walked. Annah followed, half a step behind, still looking at the buildings like they might rearrange themselves if she stared long enough. I pointed out nothing in particular—the canal, a café, a bridge people took pictures on even though there were better ones nearby.

“So what brought you here?” I asked.

She shrugged. “Work. Or the idea of it.”

“That sounds ominous.”

She smiled. “It’s just a six-month contract. Data something. I didn’t really understand the job description, but neither did they, so it felt fair.”

I laughed. She seemed relieved by that, like she’d been bracing for judgment she didn’t quite deserve.

We stopped at a small place wedged between a bike shop and something that sold only cheese. The windows were fogged, the kind of fog that promised warmth. I pointed. She nodded immediately, like she’d already decided and was waiting for permission.

Inside, we ordered coffee. She added a pastry at the last second, then looked at me, embarrassed.

“I skipped dinner,” she said. “Moving day.”

“Then it’s justified,” I said. “Legally.”

She smiled again. That one lingered.

We sat by the window. Outside, Amsterdam kept happening. Inside, time did something softer.

Annah told me about where she’d come from—never in a straight line. She jumped years, then circled back, then skipped over things entirely. I noticed the gaps but didn’t ask about them. Some stories aren’t invitations.

I told her about my job in the most neutral way possible. What I did. Not how I felt about it. That felt too personal for someone I’d known for forty minutes.

At some point she checked her phone and frowned.

“I should probably figure out how to get home,” she said. “I promised myself I wouldn’t get lost on my first day.”

“You already broke that promise,” I said. “You were standing in the bike lane.”

She groaned. “Don’t remind me.”

I gave her directions. She listened carefully, nodding, repeating street names under her breath like they might escape if she didn’t hold onto them.

When we stood to leave, there was that moment again—that quiet pause where something could’ve ended cleanly or continued messily.

“Well,” she said. “Thanks for… this.”

“For the city tour?”

“For not pretending you didn’t have time,” she said.

That caught me off guard.

“Yeah,” I said, after a beat. “Anytime.”

She hesitated, then took out her phone.

“Can I—?” she asked, already knowing the answer.

I gave her my number.

She typed it in carefully. Too carefully. Then she looked up at me, like she was memorizing my face in a way people only do when they don’t expect to see it often.

“I’ll text you,” she said.

“I’ll believe it when I see it,” I replied, trying—and failing—to sound casual.

She laughed. That same surprised sound from earlier. Then she pulled on her jacket and stepped back into the rain.

I watched her go, feeling lighter and heavier at the same time, which should’ve been a warning.

Ten minutes later, my phone buzzed.

**Annah:**  
*I already got lost.*

I smiled at the screen like an idiot.

And then, without thinking too hard about it, I typed:  
*Stay where you are. I’ll come find you.*

1qxfs60,https://bluetokaicoffee.com/products/the-teenage-trail-box-of-13-coffees,Blue Tokai’s “Teenage Trail” page is a great product held back by confusing UX and flat copy,"I’m saying this as both a long-time Blue Tokai customer and someone who works in design.

The “Teenage Trail” sampler is a fantastic idea. A curated box of 13 coffees to celebrate 13 years should feel like a milestone and an exploration of their journey.

But the product page UX and copy don’t fully support that.

A few key issues stood out:

**1. Weak information hierarchy**  
It’s not immediately clear what makes this sampler special or different. The most important context gets lost, while other elements compete for attention.

**2. Too much effort required to understand the product**  
There’s a long list of coffees, but no quick, scannable way to grasp the range or experience. It feels more like reading a document than discovering something.

**3. Grind selection creates friction**  
The options assume user confidence, which can create hesitation—especially for people newer to specialty coffee.

**4. The copy doesn’t reflect the occasion**  
This is a 13-year anniversary product, but the writing feels functional rather than celebratory. A more playful, narrative-driven tone could make the experience feel like a journey through their history instead of just a list of items.

**5. The overall experience feels transactional, not memorable**  
This should feel like an onboarding and celebration product. Right now, the interface and copy don’t fully capture that emotional weight.

—

Blue Tokai has done incredible work building specialty coffee culture in India, which is why this stood out to me. The product idea is strong. The digital experience just doesn’t reflect the same level of intentionality.

1. **Generate a Token:** Go to the [SmartThings Token Page](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens) and create a free Personal Access Token.
2. **Get Device IDs:** Go to the [SmartThings Advanced Console](https://my.smartthings.com/advanced/devices) to copy the Device ID for your TV(s).
3. **Configure App:** Open the Garmin Connect IQ app on your phone, go to **My Device > My App Settings > Samsung TV Remote**, and paste your Token and Device IDs.

# Support the Project

This is a passion project to make our Garmin watches even more useful. If you find it helpful and want to support future updates (or just keep me caffeinated while coding), you can [buy me a coffee here](https://buymeacoffee.com/crosu.store) ☕.

1qxfqdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/IMGreddit/comments/1qxfqdp/is_it_worth_it_at_this_point/,is it worth it at this point?,"I'm 24, graduated from med school back in july of last year, and currently doing 'an obligatory training year' in my country that is basically year 7 of med school.

I do nothing. I just go, sign in, stand in the way, get yelled at, humiliated by gereatrics with an MD and an ego the size of Jupiter, get in the way more, sign out and leave. 

I finish this stupid 'intern year' in July but after I have no idea what I am going to do.

I wanted to do surgery in Qatar, but that dream was crushed, then I focused on the UK pathway, and did PLABs, but UK closed its doors to IMGs. I am now studying step 1 and hoping to somehow finish and pass Step 1 then sit for Step 2 and maybe match within the next two years. 

In my country, getting a residency spot is almost as impossible as the UK and Qatar now. Most doctors are unemplyed for three years or more before they finally manage to get a residency.

Is it even worth it at this point? My day is a streak of humiliating talk downs. My fellow 'intern' was very sick the other day and he didn't show up. The next day, the attending yelled at him so loud that the residents came to check up on him afterwards. Mind you, we don't do anything, we just have to sign in and out. That's it. So I truly do not get why he got all pressed about it. All of the 'interns' just go sign in, go to the library or the coffee shop to study then come to sign out when it is time to. Everyone knows that we are all trying to study for exams to somehow manage to escape this hellhole. They have been in our shoes once, so why do the same to us?",5,1770379253.0,IMGreddit,4,0.86,False

Engaged 5 years, together 9. Living together for 7 years and moved country together 3 years ago.

In my mind we were saving money, absolute best friends who got along well and always had a good time together. Our intimacy had dropped but we still showed so much affection.

A week ago she told me she wanted more from me, more spontaneous things together, more going out of my way to surprise her and do nice things. We discussed it and I sort of thought that we didn’t go out of our way to do a lot of that stuff because she enjoyed her time alone and time to relax and when we would do things she’d often struggle to get motivated to do them so I often stopped even asking.

In my mind we would save for one big trip per year and then save for a house and do more relaxed things. And she loved planning and coming up with things to do so it was comfortable and easy for me to let her suggest and figure things out.

But after less than a week, she leaves the house in the morning telling me she loves me. And she arrived home telling me she hasn’t felt the spark in awhile and even if she still loves and cares for me she can’t see herself being with me.

I get the “you’re so amazing, I’ll always cherish everything you’ve done for me and you’ve done so much for me. But we just want different things in life and I don’t want to have to tell someone to be spontaneous and go out of their way to do nice gestures” (the amount of times I’d quickly run down to the cafe or shops etc to get her chocolate or coffee or whatever she felt like as a nice gesture apparently isn’t what she means..)

And yeah apparently no amount of time will fix it, two days later after I stayed with friends and went back to our home country, I tried to clarify it all and just got a pretty numb emotionless 100% she has no interest in me romantically anymore and that’s it.

I’ve hit 30 and feel like my life is falling apart. I had a good job in that country and some good friends but it feels like it would be easier if I just started fresh.. away from her and find a way to numb the pain.

At this point it genuinely feels like the end of my life. All my hopes and aspirations feel meaningless if I can’t share the good times with her. And I’m leaving behind my two precious amazing cats as well. ",3,1770379240.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

I’m currently using a 1Zpresso J-Ultra and for the past \~4 months I’ve been brewing mostly V60 (≈80%), light roast coffee.

Current setup:

Filters: Cafec Abaca

Brew time: 2:30–3:30

Temperature: 92°C

Gooseneck kettle with temp control

Water tested extensively (bottled, filter combinations, home RO)

→ currently using 140–160 ppm, which I like

I dial in each new bag over a week, adjusting only grind size to stay within the brew time range.

After all this, I’m starting to clearly notice the grinder’s profile:

cup feels muddy

too many fines

flavor descriptors tend to blend together instead of being clearly separated

I’m looking for a manual grinder that prioritizes clarity and flavor separation, ideally where notes like strawberry, mango, peach are more distinct.

Not interested in electric grinders.

I’ve seen a lot of hype on Reddit around Comandante C40 + Tigershark (often compared to ZP6 and Pietro, with claims of fewer fines).

I like the grind quality / UX of 1Zpresso, but also really like the design of the C40 (considering the new version).

Currently choosing between:

1Zpresso K-Ultra

Comandante C40 Tigershark

Questions:

Which would you recommend for V60 + light roast + maximum clarity?

Will this be a significant upgrade over J-Ultra, or could I just use a mesh filter to remove fines and call it a day?

Would really appreciate insights from people who’ve used these grinders. Thanks!

So maybe I'm in the wrong sub with this one? If it helps make it on topic, we haven't had sex for about half a year, I'm HLM and she's LLF.

This is a bit of a vent / rant here. Not looking for advice, just getting things off my chest.

Anyway, this morning I got shouted, screamed, and swore at by my wife.

I haven't eaten breakfast. My stomach is all in knots. I'm not sure I want to eat lunch or dinner today, either.

She has a temper issue. Every time she does this, it reminds me of all the things I hate in our relationship. It makes me want to escape, but I feel trapped in our marriage. We have a child together, and the thought of divorce is not something I've ever wanted to seriously consider.

Mostly we function as co-parents, and there is some affection between us here and there. But I'm not truly happy, I'm mostly trying to get along to keep the peace so we can all live together under one roof.

My birthday is coming up. I didn't really want to do anything to celebrate, but she kept going on about it until I agreed to go to a local restaurant. The in laws wanted to pop by for some coffee and birthday cake. Nothing too fancy.

Now I want to just cancel it all. I don't want to keep pretending things are okay. I want to spend my birthday alone.

I guess one more bonus anecdote to bring it back on topic to this sub. Last year some days before my birthday my wife had surprised my by initiating sex, completely out of the blue. At the end she (half) joked about how that would be it until my next birthday. Well it wasn't too far off, it was 2-3 times total in 2025. I'm planning for it to be zero this year.

The hills go still. Even conversations feel softer. That’s when I realized honeymoon resorts here need atmosphere more than luxury.

[Favorite place](https://preview.redd.it/nmb6wxyj0vhg1.jpg?width=1277&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ceca822a1d75ee4d66113ca6548e59721ca115c)

On another trip, I stayed at a large, well known property. Beautiful, yes. But breakfast felt like a conference hall. Couples sat quietly, surrounded by noise, scrolling phones. It didn’t feel romantic.

Later, I spent time at a smaller nature focused resort near a river. Evenings were slow. One couple skipped sightseeing just to sit outside, watching mist roll in. That stayed with me.

That’s why many couples lean toward RiverMist. Not because it’s flashy but because it gets the basics right. Fewer rooms. Natural sounds at night. Spaces where you don’t feel watched or rushed.

You’ll notice little things. Coffee tastes better when you take a sip with relaxed mind and beautiful views of surrounding. Morning walks got turned into long conversations. You stop checking the time.

If your idea of a honeymoon is peace, privacy and real connection with your partner then choose a resort that lets Chikmagalur do the talking.

There’s a little street on my way to work that I cut through when I want to avoid the main road. It’s not a secret shortcut or anything, just a quieter stretch with a corner shop, a bench that always looks slightly damp, and two trees that drop leaves like they’re paid per leaf. A few months ago someone put a battered upright piano under a cheap plastic cover by the community noticeboard. I remember noticing it once and thinking, oh, that will last about a week, then it’ll get rained on and dragged away. Except it didn’t. It just stayed there, looking stubborn. Some mornings the cover is pulled half off and the keys are visible, some mornings it’s wrapped up like it’s asleep. I kept walking past it in that half awake way you do, headphones in, coffee in hand, brain already thinking about emails. I think I filed it under ""street clutter"" and stopped actually seeing it. Then today, for no real reason, I slowed down. I was early and the air felt weirdly soft, like it had decided to be polite for once. The piano cover was folded back, and there were tiny droplets on the wood like it had been misted. Someone had taped a laminated sign to it that said PLEASE PLAY ME and underneath, in smaller writing, ""If you know one song, that’s enough."" I don’t know why that line got me. I stood there reading it twice, like my brain was buffering.



A guy in a hi vis jacket was already there, not performing, just poking out a melody with one finger. It was the kind of thing you can tell is familiar to the hands even if it’s messy, like he’d learnt it ages ago and was finding it again. Two notes would be confident and then one would be wrong, but he didn’t stop. A woman walking a pram slowed down and smiled without saying anything. Someone on a bike actually got off and leaned the bike against the wall, which felt like a big decision for a bike person. I didn’t join in, I just stood a bit away so I wasn’t hovering, and listened. The sound was thin and slightly out of tune, but it also made the street feel bigger, like it had a ceiling lifted. The guy finished, did a small shrug to himself, and walked off, leaving the cover still folded back. I thought about pulling it down to protect it, but then I didn’t, because the whole point was it being there, open, available, not precious. When I carried on walking I realised I was smiling in that dumb way you do when you forget your face is a face. I was still smiling at the crossing. It’s strange how one random thing, a sad little piano by a noticeboard, can make a normal Tuesday feel like it has a tiny pocket of warmth sewn into it.

1qxeyvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurship/comments/1qxeyvy/bank_of_america_stopped_trying_to_outbank_other/,Bank Of America stopped trying to out-bank other banks and copied the only savings system people actually stick to... They brought back the coin jar and got 2.5m customers in under a year.,"So heres the backstory.

Around 2005 BOFA was stuck in teh same trap as everyone else. Competing on rates. Running ads about ""financial freedom."" Begging people to open savings accounts.

Nothing was moving the needle.

So they brought in ideo (the design firm behind apple's first mouse) and ideo didnt ask ""how do we sell savings better."" They asked ""what do people already do that looks like saving without trying.""

And they found it. The coin jar.

You know the thing. Pay with cash, toss the change in a jar, forget about it, eventually dump it in the bank. People had been doing this forever without thinking.

But heres teh wierd part.

Plastic killed the coin jar. Once everyone switched to debit cards there was no ""spare change"" anymore. The habit didnt die because people got lazy. It died because the trigger dissapeared.

So bofa rebuilt the trigger digitally.

They called it keep the change. Every debit swipe rounds up to teh nearest dollar and the difference auto-moves into savings. Buy a coffee for $4.32 and $0.68 goes into savings. No decision. No willpower. No friction.

And they sweetened it with matching early on. 100% match on your roundups in year one. Small ongoing match after that.

Why does this work so stupidly well?

Because saving doesnt lose to greed. It loses to tuesday. Every ""should i save today"" moment is a tiny battle and willpower almost always loses to whatever else is going on.

BOFA removed the battle entirely. Saving just... happens. On top of spending. Invisible.

The results are kinda insane.

2.5m users in under 12 months. 700k new checking accounts. 1m new savings accounts. And by 2020 they said keep the change had moved $15b+ into savings with 6m+ people still using it.

Heres how to find your own version of this

Prompt 1 find the hidden competitor

""Im trying to get people to \[your desired action\]. List 10 things that arent direct competitors but steal attention or energy from this action. Focus on daily friction points and micro-decisions that drain willpower before my ask even happens.""

Prompt 2 find the existing trigger

""What are 5 automatic behaviors my target audience already does daily without thinking that i could attach \[desired action\] to. Think physical habits digital habits and money habits. Rank them by frequency and invisibility.""

prompt 3 design the piggyback

""Take the top behavior from above and design a system where \[desired action\] happens automatically as a byproduct. The user should feel like theyre doing the original habit not the new one. Make it opt-in once then invisible. Include a small early reward to lock in adoption.""

prompt 4 stress test the friction

""Play devils advocate. Why would someone still not do this even with the system above. Whats the remaining friction. Now suggest 3 ways to eliminate each friction point without adding complexity.""

The key insight everyone misses

BOFA wasnt competing with chase or wells fargo. They were competing with ""ill do it later"" and ""i forgot."" Once they stopped fighting human nature and started designing around it... they won.

Look, I've spent way too much time researching this, reading books, listening to podcasts, scrolling through studies on circadian rhythms, watching productivity YouTubers. And here's what I've learned: Most morning routine advice is straight garbage. Everyone's telling you to wake up at 5am, meditate for an hour, journal your feelings, do cold plunges, and somehow also make a green smoothie. That's not a morning routine. That's a part-time job.

The truth? Most of us fail at morning routines because we're building them based on what works for tech billionaires or Instagram influencers, not what actually fits our lives. We're fighting against our biology, our schedules, and our actual energy levels. But here's the good news: You can build a morning routine that doesn't feel like self-torture. One that actually sticks. Let me break it down.

## Step 1: Stop trying to be someone you're not

First thing? Throw out the idea that there's one ""perfect"" morning routine. Are you a night owl? Cool. Your morning routine doesn't have to start at dawn. Research from chronobiology (the study of biological rhythms) shows that about 40% of people are naturally wired to be night owls. Forcing yourself to become a morning person is like forcing yourself to be left-handed when you're right-handed. It creates unnecessary friction.

Your morning routine should fit YOUR life, not some idealized version of productivity culture. Start by asking: What time do I naturally wake up without hating life? Build from there.

## Step 2: Make it stupidly easy to start

The biggest mistake people make? Creating a routine that requires willpower. Willpower is a limited resource, especially in the morning when your brain is still half-asleep. Instead, design your routine so it's almost impossible NOT to do it.

Here's what I mean: Don't say ""I'm going to work out for 45 minutes."" Say ""I'm going to do 5 pushups."" Don't say ""I'm going to read for an hour."" Say ""I'm going to read one page."" The goal is to make the barrier to entry so low that even your groggiest, most unmotivated self can do it.

Once you start, momentum takes over. This is backed by research from BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits method. Fogg, a behavior scientist at Stanford, found that tiny actions create lasting change because they don't trigger resistance. Your brain doesn't fight against easy things.

## Step 3: Stack your habits like building blocks

Here's a game changer: habit stacking. This concept comes from James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.in/d/0fAKRG3A) (insanely good book, by the way, if you haven't read it, stop what you're doing and grab it. Clear breaks down the science of behavior change in a way that actually makes sense, and it's sold millions of copies for a reason).

The idea is simple: attach new habits to existing ones. Your brain already has established neural pathways for things you do automatically (like brushing your teeth or making coffee). Use those as anchors.

For example: After I pour my coffee, I'll do 5 minutes of stretching. After I brush my teeth, I'll write down one thing I'm grateful for. After I get dressed, I'll review my top 3 priorities for the day.

These ""after X, I'll do Y"" statements create automatic triggers. You're not relying on motivation. You're piggybacking on routines your brain already runs on autopilot.

If you want to go deeper on habit formation and productivity but don't have the energy to read through multiple books, there's this smart learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been pretty useful. It's an AI-powered platform built by Columbia University alumni that pulls from books like Atomic Habits, behavioral science research, and expert insights on productivity to create personalized audio learning plans.

You can set a specific goal like ""build a sustainable morning routine as someone who's not a morning person"" and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are actually addictive, you can pick something energetic to keep you focused during your commute or a calm tone for evening wind-down. Makes self-improvement way more digestible when you're just trying to get through the day without adding more work to your plate.

## Step 4: Protect your morning from digital chaos

Your phone is the enemy of a good morning routine. The second you check your email, texts, or social media, you're letting other people's priorities hijack your brain. Research from Dr. Andrew Huberman's podcast (the guy's a neuroscientist at Stanford, knows his stuff) shows that early morning light exposure to screens can spike cortisol at the wrong times and mess with your dopamine baseline.

Here's the move: Keep your phone out of your bedroom. Use an actual alarm clock. I know, revolutionary. Give yourself at least 30 minutes before you look at a screen. Use that time for things that actually serve YOU, movement, reading, planning your day, whatever.

## Step 5: Movement first, motivation follows

You don't need to run a marathon or hit the gym for two hours. But you do need to MOVE. Even just 5 to 10 minutes of movement in the morning changes your entire day. It gets blood flowing, wakes up your nervous system, and floods your brain with endorphins.

This doesn't have to be complicated. Walk around your block. Do some stretches. Dance to a song. Whatever gets your body moving. The Morning Miracle by Hal Elrod talks about this, he calls it the ""life S.A.V.E.R.S."" routine (Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading, Scribing). The book gets a bit self-helpy, but the core idea is solid: movement creates momentum.

## Step 6: Fuel your brain, not just your body

What you eat (or don't eat) in the morning matters more than you think. If you're slamming a sugary breakfast or chugging energy drinks, you're setting yourself up for a crash by 10am. You want stable energy that lasts.

Protein and healthy fats are your friends. Eggs, Greek yogurt, nuts, avocado, these keep your blood sugar stable and your brain sharp. If you're into intermittent fasting, cool. Just make sure when you DO eat, you're fueling properly.

And hydrate. Your body is dehydrated after 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Drink water before you drink coffee. This alone can boost your energy and focus.

## Step 7: Plan your day in 3 priorities max

Your morning routine should include some kind of planning, but don't overcomplicate it. Write down your top 3 priorities for the day. Not 10. Not 20. THREE. If you get those done, the day is a win.

This comes from productivity research showing that multitasking is a myth. Your brain can't actually focus on multiple things at once. It switches between tasks, which drains energy and kills efficiency. By narrowing your focus to 3 things, you're giving yourself permission to ignore everything else.

There's an app called [Finch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finch.finch) that helps with habit tracking and daily planning. It gamifies the process, which makes it less boring. Worth checking out if you need that extra nudge.

## Step 8: Flexibility beats perfection every time

Here's where most people screw up: they create this rigid morning routine, miss one day, and then think ""welp, I failed"" and quit entirely. Don't do that.

Your routine should have a minimum viable version, a bare-bones version you can do even on your worst days. Maybe it's just: drink water, do 5 pushups, write down 3 priorities. That's it. On good days, you can expand. On rough days, you hit the minimum and call it a win.

This is about building consistency, not perfection. Research from Dr. Phillippa Lally at University College London found it takes an average of 66 days to form a habit. But only if you're consistent. One missed day doesn't ruin everything. What ruins it is giving up entirely.

## Step 9: Track what actually works for YOU

Everyone's different. What works for your friend might not work for you. So experiment. Try different wake-up times. Try different activities. And most importantly, PAY ATTENTION to how you feel.

Are you more focused after movement? Does journaling calm your mind or stress you out? Does coffee on an empty stomach make you jittery? Track this stuff. Adjust. Your morning routine should evolve based on real feedback from your body and mind, not what some productivity guru says.

## Step 10: Rituals create identity

Here's the deeper truth: A morning routine isn't just about productivity. It's about who you're becoming. When you show up for yourself every morning, even in small ways, you're reinforcing the identity of someone who takes care of themselves, who has their shit together, who doesn't just react to life but actively shapes it.

This identity shift is powerful. It's what James Clear calls ""identity-based habits."" You're not just doing things. You're becoming the type of person who does those things. And that changes everything.

Your morning routine is proof that you're in control. That you're choosing how your day starts instead of letting it happen TO you. And honestly? That's the whole point.",1,1770376352.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

I have a long history of on/off bouts of anaemia. I had eating disorders when I was younger and was vegan or vegetarian for years. My iron would get low and I would have to take iron tablets to get it up but then it would get a little too high and I would have to stop (which I take to mean I am absorbing it normally). 

I don't have a very heavy period each month, in fact for about a decade I was on the pill and didn't even get a period! I limit my coffee intake and except for morning time I make sure to avoid eating and drinking coffee at the same time. I started eating fish again (begrudgingly) to get more iron and protein but still the levels seem to go down.

I have a history and diagnosis of an autoimmune disease and I am wondering if it is just my own body attacking me and leaving me with constantly low iron levels. 

How would I know if this is the cause? Is there any way a doctor can tell this through a test or is it a case of ruling other things out?

Does anyone struggle with this too? Have you found anything particularly helpful? ",3,1770375927.0,Autoimmune,2,1.0,False

1qxeorw,https://i.redd.it/64v75yvgquhg1.png,Finally making my Philippines trip happen -- here’s my loose route,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m heading to the Philippines in the next few weeks and wanted to share a rough itinerary I’ve put together. It’s a \~30-day outline, but realistically I’m planning to stay at least 3 months, maybe longer.

I previously made a post about flying out in January, but I had a family emergency about a week before my flight and had to cancel last minute. Thankfully everything’s resolved now, and I’m finally making it happen.

The plan (if you can even call it that) is pretty loose. I want to move around a lot, spend time in different regions, and see how things feel on the ground. I’m especially hoping to:

* Visit as many places as makes sense without rushing
* Film some watchable vlogs and hopefully get solid drone footage
* Meet people and connect with locals and other travelers

I’ve deliberately kept the itinerary flexible so I’m not locked into dates or routes. If a place clicks, I’ll stay longer. If it doesn’t, I’ll move on.

I uploaded a screenshot of the itinerary, but if it’s hard to read, here’s the direct link:  
👉 [https://wanderphilippines.com/itinerary/cav5jjhn/philippines-trip-2026](https://wanderphilippines.com/itinerary/cav5jjhn/philippines-trip-2026)

Would love:

* Feedback from people who’ve traveled the Philippines
* Suggestions for hidden gems I might be missing

And if you’re Filipino, or traveling around the Philippines, feel free to connect. Always down to grab a coffee and just chat.

1qxemcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1qxemcm/wibta_if_i_go_to_my_moms_birthday_alone_because/,WIBTA if I go to my mom’s birthday alone because my partner turns every conversation into an argument?,"I’m 30M and I’ve been with my partner ""Lena"" (29F) for almost three years. Overall we’re good together. She’s smart, passionate, and when it’s just us or with our friends, she’s funny and warm. The issue is my family. Not in a ""they hate her"" way, more in a slow grind way that makes every gathering feel like walking through a room full of mousetraps. My family is pretty normal, not super formal, but my mom’s birthday is the one event where everyone shows up, including my grandpa, a couple aunts, my cousin who brings his kids, the whole thing. It’s at my parents’ house, small living room, lots of talking over each other, lots of opinions about nothing. Lena has this habit where if someone says something she disagrees with, even slightly, she can’t let it go. She interrupts, corrects, and pushes until the other person either gives up or snaps. And then if they snap, she acts like she’s being attacked for ""just having a point"".



Last year at my mom’s birthday, it got ugly. My grandpa is 78 and he’s one of those guys who tells the same stories and has strong opinions about tiny things. He was talking about how he likes his coffee ""black, no nonsense"" and someone joked about how fancy coffee places are ridiculous now. Lena jumped in and started arguing about how it’s not ridiculous, it’s just culture, and people should be allowed to enjoy things, and then she started picking apart his wording like it was a debate club. My grandpa tried to laugh it off, but she kept cutting in, like ""no but you said it’s nonsense, explain why, what’s your logic."" My aunt tried to change the subject and Lena circled back, twice. Eventually my grandpa got annoyed and said, ""I’m too old for this, can we drop it."" Lena got quiet, and for the rest of the night she had this tight smile and barely spoke. On the drive home she cried and said my family was dismissive and that no one respects her. I told her I needed her to stop turning every casual comment into a fight, especially with my grandpa. She said she won’t ""shrink herself"" to make people comfortable.



Since then I’ve tried to manage it. I’ll gently squeeze her hand if she starts interrupting, or I’ll change the topic, or I’ll warn her ahead of time like ""my uncle will say something dumb, please don’t bite."" That last part makes me feel gross, like I’m prepping someone for battle. The thing is, she doesn’t see it as starting fights. She sees it as ""not letting people say wrong stuff"". I get that in theory, but in practice it means every family dinner has this tension where I’m watching her like a hawk, waiting for the moment she pounces. My family has noticed too. My mom has pulled me aside and said, quietly, that she likes Lena but she feels like she can’t relax around her. My cousin joked that Lena treats small talk like a courtroom. Lena overheard that and was furious for a week.



Now my mom’s birthday is coming up again and I honestly dread it. I want to be present, enjoy my mom, help cook, laugh, take pictures, not spend the whole evening doing damage control.

Overall we’re good together. She’s smart, passionate, and when it’s just us or with our friends, she’s funny and warm. The issue is my family. Not in a ""they hate her"" way, more in a slow grind way that makes every gathering feel like walking through a room full of mousetraps. My family is pretty normal, not super formal, but my mom’s birthday is the one event where everyone shows up, including my grandpa, a couple aunts, my cousin who brings his kids, the whole thing. It’s at my parents’ house, small living room, lots of talking over each other, lots of opinions about nothing. Lena has this habit where if someone says something she disagrees with, even slightly, she can’t let it go. She interrupts, corrects, and pushes until the other person either gives up or snaps. And then if they snap, she acts like she’s being attacked for ""just having a point"".



Last year at my mom’s birthday, it got ugly. My grandpa is 78 and he’s one of those guys who tells the same stories and has strong opinions about tiny things. He was talking about how he likes his coffee ""black, no nonsense"" and someone joked about how fancy coffee places are ridiculous now. Lena jumped in and started arguing about how it’s not ridiculous, it’s just culture, and people should be allowed to enjoy things, and then she started picking apart his wording like it was a debate club. My grandpa tried to laugh it off, but she kept cutting in, like ""no but you said it’s nonsense, explain why, what’s your logic."" My aunt tried to change the subject and Lena circled back, twice. Eventually my grandpa got annoyed and said, ""I’m too old for this, can we drop it."" Lena got quiet, and for the rest of the night she had this tight smile and barely spoke. On the drive home she cried and said my family was dismissive and that no one respects her. I told her I needed her to stop turning every casual comment into a fight, especially with my grandpa. She said she won’t ""shrink herself"" to make people comfortable.



Since then I’ve tried to manage it. I’ll gently squeeze her hand if she starts interrupting, or I’ll change the topic, or I’ll warn her ahead of time like ""my uncle will say something dumb, please don’t bite."" That last part makes me feel gross, like I’m prepping someone for battle. The thing is, she doesn’t see it as starting fights. She sees it as ""not letting people say wrong stuff"". I get that in theory, but in practice it means every family dinner has this tension where I’m watching her like a hawk, waiting for the moment she pounces. My family has noticed too. My mom has pulled me aside and said, quietly, that she likes Lena but she feels like she can’t relax around her. My cousin joked that Lena treats small talk like a courtroom. Lena overheard that and was furious for a week.



Now my mom’s birthday is coming up again and I honestly dread it. I want to be present, enjoy my mom, help cook, laugh, take pictures, not spend the whole evening doing damage control. I told Lena I’m thinking of going alone this time because last year got so tense and I don’t want a repeat. She immediately said I’m ""hiding her"" and acting ashamed of her. She said partners show up for each other, and if I go alone I’m basically telling my family they can exclude her. Then she said, ""So you’d rather protect your grandpa’s feelings than mine?""

Just got back from two weeks exploring lesser-known European cities *by train*, for less than $900 total. 💸

I was sick of seeing ""budget travel"" posts that barely covered flights, or directed you straight into tourist traps. So, I challenged myself: real European experience, real budget, no faff. This isn't a guide to luxury on a shoestring, it's about actually *experiencing* places without selling a kidney.

---

**The Budget Breakdown (14 Days)**

Total: $875 USD (or €805 at current rates). Here’s roughly how it shook out:

*   **Train Pass:** $220 (Interrail/Eurail Youth Pass for 4 travel days within a month. Bought during a sale.)
*   **Accommodation:** $350 (€320). Averaged about €25/night for hostels (private rooms for 3 nights!) and budget guesthouses. My best find was a €22 private room in Brasov.
*   **Food & Drinks:** $250 (€230). Focused on street food, local markets, cooking some meals in hostel kitchens, and the €8 ""daily menu"" lunches.
*   **Local Transport/Activities/Misc:** $55 (€50). Mostly walking, a few cheap museum entries, postcards.

My flights to/from Europe were separate, but this covers *everything* once I landed.

---

**Where I Went & Why It Worked**

I aimed for places that felt authentic and weren't crawling with selfie sticks.

*   **Ljubljana, Slovenia (3 days):** Absolutely charming, feels like a miniature Prague without the crowds. Spent €5 on a giant Burek, €3 on coffee. Walked everywhere. *Unpopular opinion:* Skip Bled, Ljubljana is the real heart.
*   **Zagreb, Croatia (2 days):** A vibrant capital with cool street art and a surprising museum scene (Museum of Broken Relationships is a must-see, €7). Food at Dolac Market was fantastic and cheap.
*   **Brasov, Romania (4 days):** Nestled in Transylvania, stunning medieval vibes. Hiked up to the Brasov sign, explored the Black Church. This was my personal favorite – felt genuinely undiscovered by the masses. Plus, Romanian trains are an *experience*.
*   **Budapest, Hungary (3 days - detour):** Okay, slightly more ""known"" but I hit it off-season (early March) and focused on thermal baths (Szechenyi, €20, totally worth it) and ruin bars, avoiding tourist traps. Ate incredible goulash for €7.
*   **Vienna, Austria (2 days - quick stop):** Had an overnight train here. Explored the Naschmarkt for lunch (€10 for incredible street food), walked the Ringstrasse. Yes, it's pricier, but you can see a lot for free.

---

**Unexpected Wins & What I'd Skip**

*   **Win 1: The €8 ""Daily Menu"" lunch.** Almost every city has these set-menu lunches (often 2-3 courses) at local spots. They’re delicious, filling, and a huge budget saver. Look for ""Dnevni menu"" or ""Meniul zilei.""
*   **Win 2: Hostel Kitchens.** Seriously, cook a few meals. It saves a ton and is a great way to meet people. I made pasta with hostel-mates more than once.
*   **Skip: Paying for bottled water.** Bring a reusable bottle. Most cities have safe tap water or public fountains. You'll save money and plastic.

---

**Real Talk Section: Here's What Sucked**

Not gonna lie, some train seats weren't built for comfort. I had one train from Zagreb to Brasov with a 3-hour delay, meaning a 10 PM arrival instead of 7 PM. That sucked. Also, finding decent laundry that wasn't extortionate was a mini-quest in every city. And yes, my phone died at a crucial navigation point in Brasov, leading to a long, cold walk. It happens.

> The catch nobody mentions about budget train travel: Sometimes you're on a regional train that stops everywhere, and *everything* takes longer than you think. Embrace the slow travel.

1qxehmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1qxehmd/using_my_own_macos_app_exposed_how_apple_tunes/,Using My Own macOS App Exposed How Apple Tunes Performance for New Hardware,"I recently upgraded from a MacBook Air M2 to a MacBook Pro M5.

I’ve been spending a lot of time optimizing my macOS app lately, mostly around concurrency, memory usage, and overall responsiveness. My app also has an option to enable/disable Apple’s new glass UI.

The funny part is, this realization didn’t hit me while coding, but while I was away from my desk, sipping coffee.

On my M2 Air, whenever I used my own app with the glass UI enabled, it was noticeably slower. Animations weren’t as smooth, interactions felt a bit laggy, and overall it just didn’t feel great. I always assumed it was something I still needed to optimize.

But now on the M5 MacBook Pro? No issues at all. Glass UI or not, everything feels equally smooth. Animations, responsiveness—zero difference.

And that got me thinking.

We already know Apple has openly admitted to slowing down older devices with newer software updates (officially for battery health reasons). Combine that with how macOS feels extra snappy on newer Macs, and it’s hard not to feel like a lot of this is… intentional.

Apple has a history of pushing premium experiences toward newer hardware and even selling basic things like VESA adapters separately, so seeing this contrast so clearly in my own app was kind of eye-opening.

Not saying anything new or shocking here, but it’s wild when you experience it firsthand as a developer. macOS genuinely feels like it’s designed to shine brightest on the latest machines.

Curious if other devs have noticed similar things with newer UI features vs older Macs.

Edit:

Worth mentioning: Also, this isn’t a heavy app by any stretch, no crazy graphics, no massive memory usage.",2,1770375151.0,iOSProgramming,4,0.62,False

I have stayed at a couple of resorts in Coorg and among them Evolve Back stood out because of some reasons. What I liked about it is that it doesn’t feel like a typical hotel it feels more like a plantation retreat.

The resort was set within large coffee spice estate and the villas are designed with local Kodava architectural elements which was beautiful. Many of them come with private plunge pools and are surrounded by greenery which makes the stay quiet and relaxing foe eyes after watching crowds and vehicles in cities.

**What I liked was:**

Atmosphere was good and clam and it was away from towns crowd

Villas that feel spacious and thoughtfully designed not like simple rooms

Activities such as plantation walks, nature trails, watching bird and coffee related experiences

A good balance of luxury, nature and local cultural influence it was good

It’s particularly well suited for travellers looking for a premium, nature centric experience.

**Final thoughts**

If someone is looking for unique and immersive luxury stay in Coorg, Evolve Back is one of the good options especially for couples, honeymooners or for any other special occasions.

On the other hand, if you prefer views with a slightly more conventional resort experience and Coorg Wilderness Resort is also a Good.

Ultimately, the good resort depends on your travel style mostly but both of these are consistently considered among the resorts in Coorg.

Im talking plates with dried food, pots with stuff crusted on, cups stacked like a sad little tower. And they just walk past it for days.

Ive asked nicely. Ive sent texts. Ive left notes on the counter. Once I even did their dishes for them hoping theyd feel guilty and return the favor. Nope. Nothing changed.

I stopped putting their dishes in the sink. When I found their stuff dirty on the counter or in the sink I started moving it to their desk in their room. Not aggressively thrown or anything just neatly placed right in the middle of their workspace. Bowl with cereal residue? On the desk. Pan with eggs stuck to it? Desk. Coffee mug with a week old ring inside? You guessed it.

The first time they came home and found a crusty plate sitting on their laptop they just stared at it for a second. Didnt say anything. The second time it happened they actually washed the dish that night. Third time I didnt even have to move anything because they washed it before I got the chance.

Now the sink stays mostly clear. They still slip up sometimes but the threat of their gross dishes appearing on their desk seems to have fixed like 80% of the problem.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Since my last post 5 months ago, I've let this side project on the back burner. After some careful consideration and seeing how much it has helped me become consistent, I've decided to go all-in on marketing it. 

My goal is to help people develop a consistent work habit and get at least 5+ hours of consistent work per day. It was designed to help with ADHD/time blindness, but I'm starting to realise it can be useful for anyone looking to focus better.

The app now has a bunch of different mechanisms built in to keep you aware throughout the day: colored timer disks, ambient visuals, background noise, 5 sec checkins, overtime screen, and more.

Here's how a day of using it looks for me:

* I start the day, drink 2 coffee cups, scroll socials, and plan the day for 25 minutes.
* open the app
* get hit with a visual ambience
* put on brain.fm music or background sounds from the app
* start easy to build momentum: 3 x 10 min sessions
* extend to 1 hour sessions with breaks between them

Try it out and let me know what you think. 

If you like it and believe in the mission, join our discord community where the only goal is **helping each other build this 1 focus habit**.

 She would email me at 10pm asking me to order her specific brand of coffee. She would call me on weekends asking where a file was. If I didnt respond within like 20 minutes shed send another email and then a text and sometimes loop in my manager saying I was ""unresponsive.""

I brought it up to my manager multiple times. At first she was sympathetic and told me to just ignore Linda after hours.

 Then Linda complained to the CFO who shes apparently friends with and suddenly my manager tells me I need to be more ""flexible"" and ""client service oriented"" with internal stakeholders. So basically do whatever Linda wants.

I started job hunting that week. Found something better paying with way less stress and put in my two weeks.

When Linda found out I was leaving she sent me this long email CCing my manager and the CFO about how I was ""abandoning ship"" and leaving them with ""systems nobody understands."" She ended it by saying I should ""put everything back to how it was before you started changing things so we can manage it ourselves since clearly youre not reliable.""

My manager didnt say anything to defend me. Just forwarded the email and said ""can you help with this transition request.""

So I did exactly what Linda asked.

I cancelled the new vendor contracts and reinstated the old ones that cost more. I turned off the digital scheduling system and put the paper calendar templates back in the shared drive. I removed the automation on supply ordering. I reorganized the shared drive back to the old chaotic structure that existed before I started.

I documented everything I did, sent a summary email saying ""per Lindas request everything has been reverted to the previous systems"" and walked out at noon on my last day.

I heard from a friend who still works there that the first week after I left was absolute chaos. Orders werent going through, nobody could find anything, the old vendors were confused about being reinstated. Linda apparently screamed at my old manager saying I ""sabotaged"" everything. My manager tried to call me and I didnt answer.

I didnt delete anything or break anything I just put it back the way it was. Thats what she wanted.

1qxebpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1qxebpg/sleep_paralysis_and_my_dead_mother_behind_me/,Sleep paralysis and my dead mother behind me,"So i was in my living room and fell asleep in the couch, any doors, hallway , bathroom and kitchen are behind this area i am sleeping.

So i became sleep paralysed but i could see the area in front but due to position and the fact i'm locked down i cant see behind this area or look around.

But in the paralysis i heard the front door open, i heard someone come into the house while i'm paralysed and can't look around.

I sensed the person move behind the couch but couldn't see and the go into the kitchen and that's when i heard my mothers voice.

It was her voice , clear as day, when she was alive she would go into the kitchen first thing to make coffee and so would open the fridge, she also had a habit of both talking to me, thinking out loud and talking to  herself, and what i heard seemed to resemble this, she was commenting on the fridge being empty , she was saying stuff that could be regarded as mundane and as such i didn't remember much of it, something like speaking a shopping list or to do list out loud , like ""butter, we need some sausages""

I shifted out of the paralysis , but i seemed to have my view obscure so i got the sense that actually it was a cross between sleep paralysis and false awakening , since i was sure i was awake but the fact my vision was obscure coming out of it means it was probably something in between.

By obscure vision i mean that in sleep paralysis what your eyes see is mostly exactly what is there, in my case the scene in my vision altered and i saw one of the cushions and i blanket i pulled up toward face was actually in the way, blocking most of the view in real life, suggesting i was falsely awake but the room was mostly accurate or accurate enough for me to think i'm awake , but i also couldn't move in it.",5,1770374567.0,Dreams,4,0.86,False
1qxead9,https://i.redd.it/22ojxd2uruhg1.jpeg,The Portugal Travel Guide I Wish I Had Before My First Trip: Practical Tips Beyond the Tourist Blogs,"I've been living in Portugal for several years now (moved here with my Australian wife), and I constantly get messages from friends and family planning their trips. After answering the same questions dozens of times, I figured I'd put together the practical advice that actually matters when you're on the ground here.

**When to Visit (The Real Story)**

Everyone says April-May and September-October are ideal. They're right, but here's what they don't tell you:

* **June is underrated**: Weather's fantastic, beaches aren't packed yet, and prices haven't hit summer peaks
* **Late March**: If you're coming to Lisbon/Porto, this is golden. Perfect temperature for walking cities, almost no crowds
* **December**: Hear me out - Lisbon at Christmas is magical, prices drop significantly, and you can actually get into restaurants without reservations

**The Coffee Situation (This Matters More Than You Think)**

Portuguese coffee culture is serious. Walk into any café and you'll see locals standing at the bar, ordering in rapid Portuguese. Here's your survival guide:

* **Bica** = espresso (in Lisbon)
* **Cimbalino** = espresso (in Porto - different name, same coffee)
* **Galão** = latte, served in a glass
* **Meia de leite** = half coffee, half milk (in a cup)

Pro tip: Don't order a ""cappuccino."" You'll get a confused look. Order a galão or meia de leite instead.

The funniest thing? My wife learned Portuguese from a popular app before we moved here, but it taught her Brazilian Portuguese. Her first morning in Lisbon, she confidently asked for a café com leite (Brazilian way). The barista corrected her to ""galão"" or ""meia de leite."" That moment taught us Portuguese Portuguese is its own thing - pronunciation, vocabulary, everything. If you're planning to learn any phrases before coming, make sure it's European Portuguese!

**Transportation Real Talk**

**Lisbon:**

* Get a Viva Viagem card immediately at any metro station (€0.50)
* Load it with Zapping credit or 24-hour passes
* The tram 28 is iconic but also a pickpocket magnet and tourist trap. Take tram 12 or 25 for authentic rides locals actually use
* Uber/Bolt are everywhere and cheap (€5-8 for most city rides)

**Porto:**

* The Andante card works for metro, buses, and even some trains
* Walking is your best friend here - the city's smaller than Lisbon
* Don't try to drive in Ribeira (the old town). Just don't.

**Algarve:**

* Rent a car. Public transport exists but it's frustrating
* The coastal roads are stunning - take the scenic routes
* Lagos to Sagres drive during golden hour = absolutely worth it

**Food - What to Actually Order**

Skip the tourist trap restaurants on main squares. Here's what locals eat:

**Must-tries:**

* **Pastel de nata**: Yes, go to Pastéis de Belém, but also try your local pastelaria's version
* **Francesinha** (Porto): Carb-heavy heart attack on a plate. Order it once, experience it, understand why Porto loves it
* **Sardinhas assadas**: Grilled sardines, especially during Santos Populares (June)
* **Percebes**: Goose barnacles - weird looking, surprisingly delicious
* **Caldo verde**: Simple kale soup, perfect comfort food

**Where to eat:**

* Look for ""tasca"" or ""restaurante típico""
* If you see construction workers or business people in suits eating together at lunch, that's your sign
* Lunch specials (prato do dia) are where you get authentic food cheap (€7-10 for soup, main, drink, coffee, dessert)

**The Tile Obsession**

You'll notice azulejos (tiles) everywhere. This isn't just decoration:

* The Azulejo Museum in Lisbon is genuinely fascinating (even if you think you don't care about tiles)
* Many metro stations are mini art galleries
* Check out the tiles at São Bento train station in Porto before your train leaves

**Money Matters**

* Portugal uses euros (obviously)
* Cash is still common, especially in smaller towns and traditional restaurants
* Many places have a €10-20 minimum for cards
* ATMs are everywhere - just use ones attached to actual banks to avoid fees
* Tipping: 5-10% if service was good, but it's not obligatory like in the US

**Regional Differences People Don't Mention**

**Lisbon**: International, fast-paced (by Portuguese standards), expensive, incredibly diverse food scene

**Porto**: Grittier, more traditional, locals are blunter, wine culture is everything, cheaper than Lisbon

**Algarve**: Beach resort vibe, lots of British expats, very seasonal (dead in winter, packed in summer), excellent golf

**Azores**: Different universe - volcanic islands, hiking, nature, very few traditional tourist attractions, need to rent a car

**Madeira**: Similar to Azores but more developed, amazing levada walks, year-round good weather, popular with Germans and Brits

**What Everyone Gets Wrong**

1. **""I'll do Lisbon and Porto in 3 days""** \- No. Give each city at least 2-3 days. Add day trips (Sintra from Lisbon is mandatory)
2. **""Portuguese is just like Spanish""** \- It's really not. The pronunciation is completely different. Think French meets Russian meets Spanish.
3. **""Everything's super cheap""** \- Lisbon prices have jumped significantly. It's cheaper than London/Paris but not dirt cheap anymore. Porto and smaller cities are still very reasonable.
4. **""Siestas mean everything closes midday""** \- Not really a thing in cities anymore. Small town shops might close 1-3 PM, but restaurants stay open.

**Practical Stuff Nobody Tells You**

* Shops close early Sunday (if they open at all)
* Pharmacies (farmácias) have a green cross sign and pharmacists can help with minor health issues
* Public restrooms are rare - go in cafés (ordering a coffee gets you bathroom access)
* The Atlantic is COLD, even in summer. Don't expect Mediterranean temperatures
* Bring adapters - Portugal uses European Type C/F plugs
* ""Excuse me"" = ""Com licença""
* ""Thank you"" = ""Obrigado"" (if you're male) / ""Obrigada"" (if you're female)

**The Sintra Question**

Everyone asks: ""Should I go to Sintra?"" Yes. But:

* Go early (arrive before 9 AM)
* Book Pena Palace tickets online in advance
* Skip Quinta da Regaleira if you're short on time (controversial opinion, but Pena and the Moorish Castle are better)
* Wear comfortable shoes - it's all uphill
* The 434 bus is convenient but expect queues

**Safety**

Portugal is incredibly safe. That said:

* Pickpockets work Lisbon's tram 28, Baixa area, and any crowded tourist spot
* Keep bags in front of you on public transport
* Don't leave valuables visible in parked cars (especially in Sintra parking lots)
* Scams are rare but watch for the ""helpful local"" who insists on showing you around then demands payment

**Final Thoughts**

Portugal surprised me by being both exactly what I expected and completely different. The pace is slower, people are genuinely friendly (not service-industry fake friendly), and there's this beautiful contrast between ancient traditions and modern life.

Give yourself time. Don't try to see everything. Spend an afternoon doing nothing but sitting at a miradouro (viewpoint) watching the sunset with a beer. That's when you'll understand why people fall in love with this place.
