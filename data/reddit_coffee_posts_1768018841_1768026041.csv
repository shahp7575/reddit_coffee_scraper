I'm planning a trip to Colombia and would love some feedback on my rough itinerary. This will be my first solo trip to Latin America, and I'm not sure yet if my plan makes sense. I'll be traveling for 20 days. I tend to get bored easily and prefer to stay busy most of the time.

16/03 – 18/03 | Bogotá
Arriving in Bogotá + one full day in the city. I’d like to visit the old town (La Candelaria), Paloquemao Market, Monserrate, and maybe do a bike tour or a free walking tour to see the main highlights. On 18/03, I would leave around midday to travel to Salento.

18/03 – 22/03 | Salento
Arriving in Salento and exploring the town.

Day 2: Valle de Cocora

Day 3: Visit a finca and a coffee plantation

On 22/03, I would leave Salento and travel to Medellín. Do you think it’s worth combining Valle de Cocora and a coffee plantation in one day to free up an extra day in Medellín?

22/03 – 25/03 | Medellín
Arriving in Medellín.

Day 2: Exploring the city (Comuna 13, city center, etc.)

24/03: Day trip to Guatapé

I’d also really like to go paragliding over Medellín. On 25/03, I would travel to Santa Marta.

25/03 – 29/03 (or 30/03) | Santa Marta / Lost City Trek
Arriving in Santa Marta, then starting the Lost City Trek the following day. I’m hesitating between the 4-day or 5-day hike, as the longer option seems less rushed and includes waterfalls. Any advice on this?

30/03 – 01/04 | Tayrona National Park
Visiting Tayrona. I’m unsure whether it’s better to stay overnight inside the park or do a guided day tour from Santa Marta.

01/04 – 04/04 | Cartagena
Arriving in Cartagena. Exploring the city and possibly doing a day trip to the Rosario Islands. Leaving Colombia on 04/04.

I would also really love to spend one or two days in Palomino, but I’m not sure how to fit it into my itinerary. Any tips on this?

Would you change anything in this schedule? Do you have any other suggestions, tips, or advice?
Also, is there anything special to do during Holy Week in Cartagena, and is transportation during that period reliable?",1,1768025914.0,solofemaletravellers,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

for bikes and good condition toys, local online listings are probably your best bet. think facebook marketplace, craigslist, or nextdoor. you get to keep all the money, but you have to deal with meeting people and haggling. for smaller stuff, try online consignment sites like mercari or local resale shops like kid to kid. they do the heavy lifting but take a cut. if you have any vintage or collectible toys, ebay is where you want to go for a better price, but the fees and shipping can be a pain.  
  
2. donate and feel good  
this is the easiest option for clearing out space fast, especially for the stuff that isn't worth much but is still in good shape. a lot of national charities like the salvation army or purple heart foundation will take toys and bikes. some, like pickup please, will even come to your house for a free pickup, which is a lifesaver for big items like bikes. for plastic toys specifically, an organization like second chance toys finds new homes for them. always clean the items first, they're more likely to be accepted.  
  
3. repurpose and upcycle  
this is a fun project for the really sentimental items or just the random pieces that are too broken to donate but you don't want to trash. old toy animals can be painted and turned into cool planters or drawer knobs. action figures or toy cars can become bookends or even magnets. for the bike, you could get creative and turn a vintage tricycle into a coffee table or use an old bike tire to make a toy car display shelf in your kid's room.  
  
a quick thought on the storage part too. once you clear out all those bikes and bins, you might find you have a lot of unused space in your garage, basement, or shed. you could actually list that extra space on prked and make some passive income. it's super easy to set your own price and schedule, and you basically get paid for an empty corner of your house. it's a great way to keep the clutter out and get some cash flow.  
  
hope this helps. good luck with the purge!",1,1768025368.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

# Are Teeth Whitening Procedures Safe?

Yes when done by trained professionals. At Northlane Dental, we check the health of your teeth and gums before treatment and adjust the whitening process to reduce sensitivity and increase comfort.

I've read that, if the cooperation is remote enoguh (i.e. the case of buying a coffee at Starbucks and a fraction of Starbucks' profits going to abortion) then the pleasure of the action outweights it. How can one determine the cases where this applies? Is there any principle or set of principles one may apply? I've also read that Pope Benedict XVI said that one must have proportionally grave reasons for remote material cooperation in the context of voting for a pro-abortion candidate; does this only apply in such cases where the cooperation is more direct? Drinking a coffee doesn't seem to have any grave reasons in most normal circumstances, for example.

Also, with the social media algorithms, even watching a video, for example, is cooperating to the video's channel being more recommended. Do we have to factor that in when we watch a video by someone who espouses heretical views in some of their videos (i.e. a protestant)?

  
I had the impression that remote material cooperation basically meant ""anything goes""; however, I am afraid that I may be falling in the opposite extreme, so I wish to hear fellow Catholics' opinion on this... my moral intuition kind of tends towards extremes, so I generally prefer to abide by reasoning, when possible, from solid principles",1,1768024990.0,Catholicism,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

hey all, i've been looking into ways to make some extra money from my business property since we have a lot of unused space, and i figured i'd share some ideas i found, especially for those next to other businesses that might be struggling for space. it's basically using the b2b sharing economy.  
  
first off, if you have extra parking, this is the easiest passive income stream. you can list your unused driveway or commercial lot spots on a service like prked. it's super easy to set up your listing, you get to set your own price and schedule, and it's a great way to make money from space that would otherwise just sit empty. a lot of smaller adjacent businesses or their employees probably need convenient parking, and this way they get a vip spot for cheaper than a garage, and you get some easy cash.  
  
but it's not just parking. if you have extra indoor space, there are a ton of options.  
  
1. meeting rooms and conference space. if you only use your big meeting room twice a week, you can rent it out by the hour or day. adjacent companies might not have their own nice space for big client meetings or training seminars. you can even charge a little extra for using your wi-fi, projector, and coffee machine. this is a huge way to offset your monthly rent.  
  
2. storage and warehouse space. do you have a back corner of your warehouse or a dry storage room you never use? local retail shops or e-commerce businesses always need extra inventory storage, especially around the holiday season. this can be an easy long-term rental, and it's not a lot of maintenance for you.  
  
3. desks and office overflow. if your team is hybrid or fully remote and you have a whole empty office or a row of desks, you can rent them out as hot-desks or mini-offices to a freelancer or a small startup nearby. they get a professional space to meet clients, and you get steady money for the lease of that extra space.  
  
for all of these, you definitely want to talk to your property management company or an attorney first, especially about your current lease and commercial zoning rules, and get a simple agreement in writing. but the idea of turning that dead space into a passive income source is a total game changer.  
  
hope this helps anyone else looking to monetize their property.",1,1768024104.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

corporate real estate is the second biggest expense after salaries, but right now a lot of that space is barely working. one report i saw said average office utilization is only around 35% across hybrid companies. that means companies are basically wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on empty desks and cubicles. and for what? to force people into a commute so they can stare at a half-empty floor?  
  
honestly, some of the productivity studies show that the whole ""back to the office"" thing might not even be worth it. one stanford study found hybrid workers were just as productive as in-office ones and they had 33% lower turnover. another report suggested remote workers can be 13% more productive. people get more control over their life and save on the commute, which is a win-win for morale.  
  
the real problem is the huge amount of unused space. if your company has a parking garage or a storage area that's now half empty because of hybrid work, they could be making passive income off that empty real estate. they could easily list the unused parking on something like prked to make money back. it's super easy for them to list the extra space, set their own price and schedule, and turn a massive fixed cost into a small revenue stream. the money they make can help offset the huge, non-working part of their budget.  
  
smart companies are already rethinking this. they are shedding unused square footage and redesigning the space they keep to focus on collaboration areas, big meeting rooms, and amenities like coffee bars and fitness centers. they are also changing how they measure success from ""square footage per person"" to ""cost per visit"" to make sure the building is earning its keep when employees actually show up. but even with the redesigns, there’s still a ton of real estate that’s just sitting there waiting to be utilized for something.  
  
it’s an insane financial burden right now, dragging down property values and stressing out banks with commercial mortgages. the whole market is waiting for companies to figure out how to make their real estate work as hard as their employees.  
  
hope this helps shed some light on why that giant empty building is giving you the side-eye.",1,1768024052.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

hey everyone,  
  
i've been researching how to make some extra cash when a big conference or trade show comes to town, not just by selling inside the event but by finding a spot right outside the main venue. figured i'd share some ideas i came across because the opportunities are actually pretty diverse.  
  
first off, everyone who goes to a conference is driving and they all hate the parking chaos. the big win right now is using an app like prked to book a spot in a private driveway or unused lot nearby. if you live close and have an empty space, you can list it on prked for hourly or daily rental. it’s easy setup, you control the rates and schedule, and it’s totally passive income. for the parkers, it's a huge stress-saver because they can book a spot in seconds, it’s usually way cheaper than a commercial garage, and they can find exclusive spots they wouldn't see otherwise. some hosts even let you choose spots with security cameras or ask for a picture of your car for peace of mind, which is a big deal when you have a nice vehicle. it lets people skip the massive line leaving the stadium parking lot after the event, too.  
  
now for the actual business ideas to make money during the event:  
  
high-demand services pop-ups: don't overthink it. people attending conferences are professionals on the go. think about what they forget or run out of. a pop-up selling portable chargers, power strips, or high-speed wi-fi hotspots would be huge because the venue wi-fi is always slow or maxed out. another simple idea is a cart selling pre-packaged fresh snacks, gum, or mints—stuff people grab right before a networking session.  
  
experiential retail: instead of just a regular store, go for a pop-up shop with a theme that ties into the conference. for a tech conference, set up a temporary shop with the latest cool gadgets where people can try them out before buying. for a fashion or design show, run a limited-time exclusive clothing or accessories shop that plays on the idea of fomo (fear of missing out) to drive quick sales. a temporary art gallery or handmade jewelry shop is also great for attendees looking for a unique souvenir or gift to take home.  
  
food and beverage niche: you can go beyond a food truck. think of a themed pop-up cafe or coffee bar. people are often looking for quick, quality caffeine and unique lunch options that aren't the standard convention center fare. you could partner with a local caterer for unique food and beverage options that add value and a local touch.  
  
workshops and demos: if your business is service-based, host a small, paid workshop or a live product demonstration. it can tie into the main event's theme and gives you a chance to pitch your core service to a captive audience.  
  
the key is the temporary location. you create urgency and excitement because you're only there for the duration of the event. use the nearby conference crowd as your built-in audience.  
  
hope this helps anyone looking to get in on that event money.",1,1768023930.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Here’s a bit about me if you’d like to connect:

Originally from the Midwest, I now reside in New York City. I have a love  for bubble baths (bath bombs are absolutely the best!), and you’ll often find me enjoying iced coffee—yes, even in winter! I love spending time in bookstores, especially when it comes to fiction. I love movies, and some of my all-time favorites include 'The Holiday,' 'The Wizard of Oz,' and 'The Sound of Music.'

I believe I'm a good person—kind and patient, yet not easily taken advantage of. Allow me to share a bit about myself: I don't have much time for socializing due to my demanding work schedule. While I do have friends and engage in activities, my work commitments often align with their free time. They are happily married with children, and I genuinely celebrate their happiness, but our lifestyles are quite different, which is why I find myself here.

I’m a night owl, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. I enjoy sipping on ice-cold Coca-Cola while diving into audiobooks or catching up on a series or movie.

I lean towards the blue side politically, so please reach out only if you share a similar viewpoint. Additionally, if you devote a lot of time to video games, I’d prefer you not to contact me. Also, if you are a massive sports fan and must watch hours of sports a week, please don’t contact me; that’s not my idea of a good time.

1q8w1e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1q8w1e5/how_to_get_over_a_guy/,How to get over a guy,"Met a guy on reddit he dm'ed when I asked some doubts, I don't know how we bonded so fastly talked so much on the first day only. He thanked me for being so kind and jolival. 

Next day too we talked a lot like for hrs late night and after that too it continued for few more days. He was my first male interaction ever in this way. I did talked to several boys before but they all were just classmates and work purpose only. He knew it, I was like an excited fool telling him everything Abt myself , my family, my frnds and everything. 

Whenever he would text a smile would appear on my lips he called me ma'am and we even gave each other nicknames. Evrything was going on normal idk how it turned flirty, he would flirt , I would too reply in the same way, I tried to rizz him too but he was never rizzed just except one time 🥲while his every text was enough to rizz me hard. He was experienced, he did had a lot of experience dealing with girls and all. He told me all this himself. While I'm a noob knowing nothing.

Idk how why and how I developed these feelings that I shouldn't have developed. In started he told me that his frnd once proposed him and things became bitter between them, i promised him that I won't do it like this even if it happens I will block him , I'm pathetic , foolish 🥲 told him that I would never do that and the moment I had those feelings for you i will block you, cause I'm scared and all , he laughed saying ""dekhte hain fhir kab block hota hu"" 

He told me he goes with flow think abt present only. Told me he is not here for timepass wanted to make a good frnd. I too was looking for a very good frndship but these feelings destroyed everything. 

After talking a few days he did ignored me , my frnd told me boys like to chase if you will msg him  first will always wait for his text he will do this only but we were frnds right who does this to a frnd!!? He would reply after one day or so with a hooking text like he would continue the Convo not allowing me to end it. Finally i confronted him saying what's going on if you want to ignore me just tell me clearly Obv I can't force you to talk or be my frnd. It's fine if we don't talk please don't play this game of ignoring and leaving a hooking text to continue the convo. He apologized and tried giving reasons that he was really busy and wanted our Convo to go on that's why always left a hooking text like questioning Abt my day and other other things.

Again he started talking normally , my frnd warned me not to talk at night but he and I both were free at night only, his one msg controlled me I was a moth attracted to fire him, we did talked abt a lot of things , Abt those things that normal frnds would never but it was just like a question and answer. 

I asked him "" do frnds talk like this be be serious, cause i have never""

He said "" same i have never talked to a frnd like this"" 

""Then why we talked like and how it reached here"" 

""I don't know how it reached here xyz (the nickname he gave me)"" 

I asked him what if I fall for you? He told me then I will pick you up romantically 😭😭 how..how.. i who has never talked to a boy like this would not feel those things. He had tactics, he was a player, he knew what to do. 

After that I did told him i was joking Abt it and all as im scared of attachment and relationships, he told to relax and that he was also joking. Even I asked him abt his first kiss he told me it was so good and told me to give it a try too I told me I don't have anyone should I grab a random person on road!?.

He laughed saying ""instead of random You should give a chance to frnds ,like give it to me "" 💀🙏 I was shocked like wth. He laughed saying he meant it in a joking way only but this was enough to make my heartbeat out of control. He has a lot of experience. 

Maybe he regretted that he flirted and talked to me in this way as I'm complety new and naive or he knew that I had feelings he never replied from past three days. I even went to the coffee shop he recommend and send him a pic his reply was normal like ohh nice. 

My frnd was like you will fall for him definetly I was like no never he is just a frnd and not that handsome too. She laughed saying just wait. Just day before yesterday I realized my feelings that I did felt something for him cried badly, head was paining eyes were paining was just imagining abt his face that earlier me found so basic. It was like hell next day had fever. 

My frnd who was texting me told me that I should confess and make things clear but no Im scared, my frnd told me to give her my id she will do it on my behalf but I refused. She was also a bit sceptical that what if he accepted me, I wasnt scared of rejection but was of acceptance. The guy is not a good person in many ways still these feelings won't go away. 

Idk weather i really like him as just cause I have never interacted with any male and it's mere attachment but whatever it is it's too much to bear. 

I texted him that I'm leaving telegram cause want to cut off social media for studies and will use my mother's phone and uninstalled the app otherwise would have cried reading our chats and listening his vn. 

His reply was understandable it's okay all the best then. He never said a single thing more. Expectations hurt. 

Is he bored of me...?  Was he just doing timepass? Is he scared of me getting attached? There are many questions within me but will remain unanswered. 

Been two days restlessness has been eating me alive, I don't know what to do...it hurting and paining a lot but idk what if after few months he texted me again when I will go back on tg.

Please tell me is he doing this for me thinking like she is innocent and I shouldnt play with her feelings or he doesn't give a damn to me.

How do I get over him, do I like him ? Or is it just attachment caused by my first male interaction. Why he flirted and talked in this way, he knew I have never then why 😭😭

(He doesn't use reddit that much but what if he saw that's why will delete it) 

He asked me when we first talked 

""you made your id during your break up?"" 😭💀🥲

""I said noo , just randomly chose the name it's cringe ik"" 

He laughed saying mine is more cringe.

Why did it happened wish we never talked😭😭 or got to know each other. We send our eyes pic to each other at first cause of reddit trend, his eyes were hooded and looked so good making me imagine he has a handsome face 🥲. 

He likes my eyes a lot said I won't be able to forget your eyes ever they are so beautiful. You are so cute, so adorable idk he said many things like that 😭 he trapped me in his talks. His personality was so good not like my foolish. 

Who even delete telegram filled with so much study materials and grps 😭😭 I did for myself and to stay away from him he must have gotten the hint but his reaction was just vague. Idk wht he must be thinking and all... 

Idk what to do ,sorry for saying this much 🙏🙏😭 I'm just hurt. Please help me i cry many times a day hiding from my family I feel so bad for myself.

💰 Price: $110 (No tax, no shipping fee!)

🏷️ Tag: ✨ Brand New



📦 The Deal:

Condition: Literally Brand New. Seller bought it, assembled it, and realized it didn't fit their living room layout.

Style: Features a sliding slatted door (super trendy ""Japandi"" vibe) and open storage.

Color: Natural Oak / Light Brown wood tone.



🧐 Gary's Note:

""This is the best kind of secondhand item: Other People's Mistakes.

The seller did the hard work (assembly) and paid the tax/shipping, only to realize they didn't like the size.

Now you get a brand new table for a discount.

The slatted wood design is very popular right now (looks like something from West Elm or Castlery).

Since it's in Eastvale, it's a bit of a drive, but for a brand new item, it might be worth it.""

i figured i'd share some info on commercial property zoning because a lot of people don't realize that their current building use might be way less than what the zoning actually allows for a profit. you might be sitting on a goldmine of legal uses you didn't know about.  
  
the first thing you have to do is check your property's current zoning classification. don't just assume what the previous owner was doing is the only thing you can do. you'll need the property address or parcel number and then go to your local city or county planning and zoning department's website. they usually have an online zoning map or a property search tool.  
  
once you have the code (like c-1, c-2, or m-1) you need to find the corresponding zoning ordinance or land use code document. this is the crucial part. it's basically a big list that tells you exactly what is allowed. commercial zones like c-1 (neighborhood commercial) allow smaller businesses like coffee shops or offices, while c-3 or c-4 (heavy commercial) allows for big-box retail or auto dealerships.  
  
the ordinance lists three main types of uses for your zone:  
  
1. permitted uses (by-right): these are uses you can start with just a standard zoning permit for a change of use, assuming you meet all the building codes. for example, if your building was a dry cleaner but your c-2 zoning also permits 'retail sales,' you can likely switch to a boutique with just a change of use permit.  
  
2. conditional uses (special exception): these are uses that are generally allowed but need extra approval because they might impact the neighborhood more (like a large daycare or a gas station). you'll need to apply for a conditional use permit, which usually involves submitting a detailed plan and attending a public hearing.  
  
3. not permitted: if your desired use isn't on the list at all, you'd need to go through the lengthy and expensive process of rezoning the property, which is a big deal and not guaranteed.  
  
a lot of commercial properties also have extra space or unused parking that falls under the permitted use of the property. if you have an unused driveway, garage, or even a few open spots in your lot that aren't tied up in the minimum parking requirements for your building's use, you can easily list that extra space on prked. it's an easy way to make passive income from unused assets on your property. you set your own price and schedule.  
  
always call the planning department to discuss your specific intentions. a city planner can look at your address and confirm exactly what permits you'll need, which saves a ton of time and avoids legal headaches.  
  
hope this helps you unlock your property's full potential.",1,1768023801.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q8w062,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1q8w062/the_psychology_of_attraction_subtle_signs_youre/,The Psychology of Attraction: Subtle Signs You're WAY More Attractive Than You Think (Science-Based),"Okay real talk. I spent way too much time researching this because I was convinced I was mid at best. Turns out most of us are walking around thinking we're like a 4 when we're actually closer to a 7 or 8. The problem isn't our faces or bodies, it's our brains lying to us constantly.

Here's the thing nobody tells you about attractiveness. Your brain has this wild negativity bias where it literally highlights every flaw and ignores everything good. Evolution made us this way so we'd stay alert to threats, but now it just means you fixate on that one weird eyebrow hair while ignoring the fact that strangers keep making eye contact with you at coffee shops.

I pulled this from legit sources: evolutionary psychology research, body language studies, neuroscience podcasts, behavioral economics books. Not just random internet fluff. And honestly some of these signs hit different when you realize what they actually mean.

**1. People remember random details about you**

If coworkers or acquaintances bring up something small you mentioned weeks ago, that's a massive tell. Attractive people create what psychologists call ""attentional magnetism"" where others unconsciously pay more attention to them. Your brain naturally catalogs information about people it finds appealing. So when someone remembers you hate cilantro or that your dog is named Kevin, their subconscious was paying attention because you registered as attractive.

**2. You get the ""double take"" or lingering eye contact**

This one's straight from nonverbal communication research. When someone finds another person attractive, their gaze lingers 0.5 to 1 second longer than normal. You might catch people looking, then looking away quick, then glancing back. That's not creepy behavior necessarily, that's their brain doing a double check because attractive faces trigger dopamine responses. If this happens semi regularly at the gym, grocery store, wherever, your attractiveness level is higher than you think.

**3. People act slightly nervous or overcompensate around you**

Ever notice someone talking too much around you? Or getting weirdly formal? Or laughing extra hard at your mid jokes? Social psychologist Amy Cuddy's research shows people unconsciously adjust their behavior around attractive individuals. They're trying to impress you or afraid of looking dumb. If baristas seem flustered, if new acquaintances seem eager to please, if people apologize for nothing around you, congrats. You're hot and it's making them spiral a little.

**4. You get complimented on ""personality"" traits weirdly often**

Here's a sneaky one from the halo effect research. When people find you physically attractive, they attribute other positive qualities to you automatically. Intelligence, humor, kindness, all of it. So if people keep saying you're ""so funny"" or ""really smart"" when you're pretty average at those things, it might actually be because they think you're attractive and their brain is filling in the rest. It's not fair but it's how human perception works.

**5. People mirror your body language constantly**

Mirroring is an unconscious behavior we do around people we're attracted to or want to connect with. If you notice people copying your gestures, matching your energy, leaning in when you lean in, that's attraction showing up. This comes from neuroscience research on mirror neurons. We literally can't help but sync up with people we find appealing. Pay attention next time you're talking to someone. If they're matching your vibe, you've got more pull than you realize.

**6. You get offers for help without asking**

Strangers offering to grab something off a high shelf, coworkers volunteering to help with your project, people holding doors open longer than necessary. Attractiveness triggers prosocial behavior, meaning people want to be helpful and generous toward attractive individuals. It's called the ""what is beautiful is good"" stereotype in social psych. If you're getting unsolicited help regularly, people are subconsciously trying to get in your good graces.

**7. Your flaws get reframed as quirks**

Big nose? ""It's distinguished."" Loud laugh? ""So infectious."" Messy hair? ""Effortlessly cool."" When people are attracted to you, your ""flaws"" become endearing instead of dealbreakers. I saw this explained perfectly in ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer, former FBI behavioral analyst. He breaks down how attraction warps perception. If people describe your obvious imperfections as charming or unique, they're attracted to you and working backwards to justify it.

For anyone spiraling about this, the book ""The Confidence Gap"" by Russ Harris is insanely good at explaining why we're so bad at seeing ourselves accurately. Harris is an acceptance and commitment therapy expert and the book won multiple psychology awards. It teaches you how to separate your anxious thoughts from reality. Will genuinely change how you see yourself.

**8. People get weirdly competitive around you**

Your friend suddenly needs to one up your stories. A coworker starts peacocking when you enter the room. Someone keeps trying to prove how cool or successful they are unprompted. Competition signals perceived mate value in evolutionary psychology terms. If people are trying to outshine you, they see you as high value and feel threatened. It's annoying but it means you're more attractive than you think.

**9. You get included in things you didn't really earn**

Maybe you got invited to a party where you barely know anyone. Or added to a group chat. Or asked to join a project team when you're new. Attractive people get included more because others want them around. It creates social capital just having good looking people in your circle. If you're getting these random invites and thinking ""why me though,"" attractiveness is probably the answer.

**10. People assume you're in a relationship**

""Wait, you're single?"" If you hear this a lot, it's because people assume attractive individuals get snatched up quick. It's a backwards compliment. They're surprised you're available because they think you shouldn't be.

Look, here's what all this research really shows. Most of us are walking around with completely warped self images because our brains are wired to protect us from rejection by assuming the worst. We focus on the one person who didn't laugh at our joke instead of the five who did. We remember the bad haircut from 2019 but forget the compliment we got yesterday.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google experts that turns top psychology books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. You can ask it about any personal development goal, like improving self-perception or understanding attraction psychology, and it pulls from verified sources to create custom podcasts for you.

Plus there's a virtual coach called Freedia that creates adaptive learning plans based on your specific struggles and keeps evolving with you over time. Worth checking out if you want structured, science-backed content that actually fits your schedule.

You're very likely more attractive than you think. The gap between how you see yourself and how others see you is usually massive. Maybe sit with that for a minute instead of immediately dismissing it. Because if you're reading this and going ""yeah but not me though,"" that's exactly the cognitive bias I'm talking about.

1q8vyz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1q8vyz8/tifu_by_wearing_leggings_to_work/,TIFU by wearing leggings to work,"Obligatory “this didn't happen today”, as this happened a couple weeks before Christmas. Throwaway because I'm still burning with embarrassment.

I had to go into the office the morning after getting back super late the night before from a week-long getaway with my boyfriend. I was already hopelessly behind on laundry before I left, and woke up late that morning, and I was actually extra late because I go to the gym in the mornings on my office days, so I grabbed the first clean business casual top I could find in my wardrobe and threw it into my gym bag. All my work pants were in the wash, so I took the first pair of leggings in my drawer and ran out the door hoping for the best.

When I was getting dressed after gym, having finally woken up in the shower, I realised I fucked up. While my high-necked sleeveless top was cute while still being work-appropriate, I’d blindly chosen leggings that were super thin, super tight and light grey. They were at least two sizes two small and you could totally see my panties underneath, and my top wasn't long enough to cover my ass. I’d actually forgotten these leggings existed, as they were from a botched online order ages ago and were so cheap it wasn't worth returning them.

I didn't have time, as I'd agreed to go for a morning coffee straight after gym with a friend, so I just put on my heels, did my makeup and prayed nobody would notice. Luckily, my gym and this coffee place are all within the same building, so I made it just in time to meet my friend.

While we lined up for coffee and were chatting, I couldn't stop thinking about how badly I'd fucked up my outfit. It was my team's anchor day, so I couldn't just go home and change. Eventually, my friend noticed I was a bit distracted, and asked if I was alright, so I told him about my wardrobe malfunction and, since he actually knows stuff about fashion, I asked him if he thought my outfit was work-appropriate.

He said, “It's stretching business casual, yeah,” and I wanted the floor to swallow me up.

I asked him what he thought I should do, given I didn't have anything else to wear, and he suggested I ditch my underwear and go commando so at least my panties wouldn't show. At this point, I was so desperate that I just went with it, so as soon as our coffees had been made, we wandered over to the restroom behind the food court so I could take my panties off. I quickly checked myself in the mirror and he was right, it looked a lot better without any obvious lines. The leggings were so tight that the centre seam went straight up my ass crack.

I hurried back to my friend, who patiently held my coffee for me, and we headed up to the office together, chatting in the lift. He works on a lower floor than me, so he wished me luck and headed off to his desk. 

I was hoping to slip in and get to my desk without attracting too much attention, and maybe cover my stupid outfit with a blazer or something, but I was totally out of luck. My team was about to head downstairs for their own coffee run, so my manager came over to invite me almost as soon as I'd put my bag on my desk, and so I joined in.

We all went downstairs in the same lift together, and I got in last, so I was right at the front of the lift. Our lifts have mirrors on the doors, so I stood face-to-face with my full-length reflection, and that's when I discovered to my horror that I'd really fucked up. 

Because I wasn't wearing any panties, the centre seam of the leggings had ridden up between my lips, broadcasting the outline of my vagina to the world.

My manager definitely noticed, but she didn't say anything, and nor did anyone else in my team, but now I was even more self-conscious, especially because I could tell that the guys were looking at my ass.

I basically spent the rest of the day feeling like I was walking around the office naked below the waist, and was super conscious of people looking at me. It was even worse when I went downstairs again for lunch, as I could feel eyes on me the entire time I was lining up for sushi, but at least I managed to spend most of the afternoon safely seated at my desk.

Thankfully, I got a seat on the train home.

Tl;dr I stupidly wore super thin, super tight leggings to work and basically gave my whole team a free show of my ass and vagina.",0,1768023660.0,tifu,5,0.25,False

1q8vye0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1q8vye0/arranged_marriage_story_idea/,Arranged Marriage Story Idea,"There’s a lot words here- but it’s so that way we can write something great.

Hello- so here is a prompt- we do not have to use this prompt but this is merely a starting point.

If you could come with a reason for their to be an arranged marriage as I would appreciate it since I clearly couldn’t, that would be awesome. (All names we can absolutely change. And please come with ideas.)

The idea is that Bridget (MC) was in a good and serious relationship with Michael “Mike”. He left and this is a few years after he left. Again names can totally change. Come with ideas please!

Bridget never thought she’d see Michael Hayes again—Mike, the boy who once knew every version of her, the first person who ever broke her heart, and the one she swore she was done with forever.

She’s still the same girl next door in spirit: dark curls forever escaping their pins, whimsy stitched into the way she sees the world, hope she pretends she no longer carries. But life hardened her after Mike left—no explanations, no promises kept, just silence. Years later, she’s learned to survive without him.

So when her parents announce an arranged marriage to “an old family friend,” Bridget expects a stranger.

Bridget agrees to the arranged marriage because it feels safer than love.

She tells herself it’s practical—Mike’s family is respected, his brother is kind, dependable, and everything a future should be. Michael’s younger brother offers certainty where Mike once offered fire and then disappeared. Their families frame it as harmony, as a way to strengthen old ties. Bridget convinces herself she’s already survived the worst heartbreak of her life. She can survive a marriage without passion.

What no one plans for is Mike’s return.

Michael “Mike” was never meant to come back—never meant to stand across the room while Bridget laughs softly beside his brother, never meant to realize the woman he lost is now promised to someone else wearing his last name. Years ago, Mike walked away without explanation, carrying a secret that forced his silence. Now he’s back too late, too aware, and far too in love.

Every family gathering becomes a test of restraint. Bridget avoids Mike’s gaze, knowing one look will unravel years of carefully constructed resolve. Mike keeps his distance, determined not to betray his brother—until Bridget starts asking questions she never thought she needed answered.

The truth complicates everything: Mike didn’t leave because he stopped loving her. He left because loving her cost him something he thought she deserved more than his presence.

As the wedding approaches, Bridget must confront the unthinkable—whether honoring an arrangement means betraying her own heart, and whether choosing love means breaking promises that will shatter more than just her future.

Because this time, loving Mike isn’t just forbidden.

It would destroy a family.

Why did Mike leave? Here are some ideas!

*Option 1: Mike Took the Fall (Sacrificial Secret – High Tragedy)*

Years ago, Mike’s brother was involved in a serious incident—one reckless night that could have ended his future or destroyed the family name. Mike stepped in and took the blame, quietly accepting the consequences so his younger brother could walk away untouched.

Mike had to leave town as part of the fallout—legal pressure, family demands, or a condition tied to keeping the truth buried. Staying with Bridget would have dragged her into scandal and forced her to lie for him. So he left without explanation, believing absence was kinder than truth.

Now Bridget is engaged to the very brother whose life Mike saved.

If she learns the truth, her marriage becomes a monument to Mike’s sacrifice—and choosing Mike would mean exposing the secret and shattering the family.

*Option 2: Mike Was Forced Out (Manipulation & Control – Psychological Drama)*

Mike didn’t leave on his own terms.

His parents discovered his relationship with Bridget and decided she wasn’t “right” for the family—too whimsical, too unpredictable, too ordinary. At the same time, they saw Mike’s brother as the safer heir.

They gave Mike an ultimatum: leave Bridget and the city, or his brother would lose everything—education, inheritance, standing. Mike chose exile, bound by a silence enforced by guilt and fear.

Years later, Bridget is arranged to marry the brother, never knowing the relationship was engineered from the beginning. Mike’s return threatens to unravel years of manipulation—and forces Bridget to question whether her choices were ever her own.

*Option 3: Mike Was Sick (Love as Protection – Emotional Anguish)*

Mike left because he was diagnosed with a serious, life-altering illness. One with no guaranteed outcome.

He couldn’t bear the thought of Bridget tying her life to uncertainty, hospital rooms, or loss. His family supported the decision to send him away for treatment, insisting Bridget must never know.

He survived—but changed. Harder. Quieter. Carrying the weight of a love he never stopped choosing.

Now Bridget is engaged to his brother, believing she was abandoned. When the truth emerges, the question becomes devastatingly simple: Is love still forbidden if it never truly ended?

Before Mike left, he and Bridget were easy in a way that felt rare and dangerous.

They grew up half in each other’s lives—shared fences, shared secrets, shared late nights sitting on front steps with coffee gone cold. Bridget brought whimsy into Mike’s carefully ordered world; she made him laugh when he forgot how, made him look at ordinary things like they mattered. Mike was her anchor—steady hands, quiet loyalty, the person who showed up without needing to be asked.

They weren’t dramatic. They were intimate in small ways: knowing each other’s routines, finishing sentences, memorizing silences. Mike learned the meaning behind Bridget’s moods. Bridget learned the weight Mike carried and loved him anyway.

They talked about the future like it was a given—not a dream, but a direction. Marriage wasn’t a question, just something waiting its turn.

So when Mike left without explanation, the betrayal wasn’t loud.

It was devastating in its quiet.

Bridget didn’t lose a love—she lost the person who knew her best, and the certainty that love, once chosen, would stay.",1,1768023607.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

So I just joined the family, like literally hours ago. I did a bit of research on the GCP evo pro beforehand. But the deal was good, and I couldn’t pass so I was willing to roll the dice either way

Found this 2023 on marketplace. I’m fairly new to home espresso. I’ve had a bambino for a few months now, and as I’m sure you know, outgrew it within weeks. The lack of control leaves a lot to be desired. I’m more on the hobbiest end of the spectrum, and I like to tinker. After reading all about the mods for gaggia I knew I needed one. What can the community tell me about this thing? I read about boiler gate? I have little to no knowledge on gaggia coming into this. So any advice, tips, tricks are very appreciated. I’ve watched a few videos of the temp surfing, the “pre infusion” tricks and what not. At some point soon I’ll probably do the shades of coffee bundle kit with PID, pressure gauge and flow control.

1q8vy5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CritCrab/comments/1q8vy5f/the_dread_epic/,The Dread Epic,"So, after the newest video and the demand for lighter stories, I decided it's time to finally write down one of the most epic Dread games I ever had. It's been 15 years since this story took place, but the good thing is that we have made notes, as I wanted to turn the story into a book and just never found the time to do so. So here it goes.

This is only the first part of the epic. I'm not good at keeping it short, especially because I love writing and telling stories. I did want to write this story as a book and a lot of it still lingers in my head, so I am sorry for it being so extremely long. But I hope some of you still enjoy the read. There is at least one more epic moment in this story, but as this is already long enough, I would save that for a part two if anyone is interested :3

Since it's a long one, I titled it all, just jump to ""The story"" if the whole pre-story setup is too long for you <3

**Dread:**

For anyone unfamiliar with Dread - this is not played with dice, but with a Jenga tower. I don't remember the actual rules, but they are pretty much customizable. If I remember right, the official rules call for a party of 6, you build the tower, and for every person you're short, you remove at least one block. You can do more for a more dreadful session, or less for a steadier session (at least at the start).

Every action you would usually roll the dice for in DnD, you have to remove a block from the tower. If it's a very complex action (that's either very difficult or consists of different smaller actions), you have to remove more. If you succeed, you succeed; if the tower falls, you die. You can, however, decide to destroy the tower. This will ultimately kill you, but whatever action - no matter how complex or difficult - will succeed. Of course, this has to be obvious. You can't just start to pick at a block, realise the tower is about to fall, and switch to destroying it.

Additional rule we had (might be part of the official rules, but I don't remember) - If the tower wobbles significantly, you succeed, but it doesn't go as smoothly as it could have.

Since Dread is usually for oneshots, the DM can pick one of the official scenarios (or a fan-made one) or prepare one themselves. Each scenario calls for specific roles that are set one way or another, so character creation is minimized on the players' sides. For example, a character's job, position, profession, religion, rank, whatever, can be preset.

For our story, our DM brewed something up himself, and gave us each a secret we discussed with him in 2 to 5 minutes between 4 eyes. So no one else in the party knew. We didn't even know if we kind of had the same secret, or if we all had a secret, or if only one of us was special and the rest just had a chat with our DM to make it seem like we all had something going on.

I'm not sure if this is an official Dread rule, but it was one for us: Our DM asked us what we packed for the mission, and if we didn't write something down, we didn't have it. Except for the clothes we were wearing, a handgun each, and our cellphones. We were limited to 6 items each, and we all had one secret personal item.

**Our Setting:**

DM will be called DM, and all other players I will call by their character name. The story was set in the modern world. The DM told us that we were part of a secret organisation that had made it its mission to fight one of the world's biggest, secret cults. This cult was stealing and hoarding relics and artifacts in order to summon demons and eventually take over the world. Our organisation's mission was to find relics and artifacts before the BBE could find them, and retrieve those already in their possession.

While we all knew about magical items, people didn't possess magic, nor did we have any proof that gods, demons, and devils were real. To the common people, even magical items were unheard of.

We were to infiltrate a huge office building that was a front for a cult hub to find and retrieve one of the most important artifacts - the grimoire. This artifact was said to lead the cult to their goal if they managed to decipher it.

We had 4 characters to choose from, since we were 4 players, and distributed them without any fuss. We played a lot together as we all went to Uni together, and our DM was our prof, so he knew exactly what type of characters suited us. We agreed to remove 6 Jenga blocks from the tower. We chose our characters as follows:

Lyra (me) - The boss of the group. Undercover in the officebuilding as a cleaning lady for the past 3 months. Packed: C4 (sue me), a flashlight, a 10m rope, a lighter, map of the building (hidden underground partially mapped), two-way in-ear radio.

John - The hacker of the group. Undercover in the officebuilding as a security guard for the past 2 weeks. Packed: Lockpick set, hacker device (I don't recall the name, so I'll just call it that), 2 USB sticks with corruption male ware, a power-block, a flashlight, two-way in-ear radio.

Charlie - The mechanic of the group. Undercover in the officebuilding as a front desk clerk for the past 2 months. Packed: Tool set (one handle, interchangeable heads), pliers, small parts tin (a few screws/bolts, wire, connectors, a couple fuses), a headlamp, tape, two-way in-ear radio.

Claude - The medic of the group. Undercover in the officebuilding as a normal employee for the past 4 weeks. Packed: First-aid kit, 4 EpiPens, sewing kit, a flashlight, a pack of cigarettes and a lighter (DM allowed it to be one item), two-way in-ear radio.

**The story:**

This was the night all our preparation would come to fruit. We've been pretending to not know each other for weeks and months, filling our undercover roles perfectly. John and I are on night shift. I push my cleaning cart through the corridor to get ready for the night, but contrary to any prior night, this night the cart contains 4 backpacks hidden beneath all the cleaning supplies.

Charlie is wrapping up at the front desk; it was getting late but he had to work a little longer. He has been doing this once in a while, so this night wouldn't seem any different than any other night.

Claude had left just two hours ago, but comes running back. He forgot his phone.

I make my way through the corridors. As always, I park my cart right in front of the security room and go and make two cups of coffee, one for John, one for myself. While we chat as any other night, John is slowly but surely ensuring the start of our mission. He manipulates the camera feeds with old records. We make smalltalk, but we are using codewords. John can't just mute the cameras while we speak, that would be too obvious.

Once John lets me know that the cameras have been dealt with, I leave, dropping John's backpack in front of his door. I equip my comms. Claude and Charlie have theirs already equipped. I radio them that we are ready. They both have played their part well. Claude wants to get back inside, Charlie denies him. Finally, Claude leaves frustrated, that's when John overwrites the last cameras - the ones in the entrance hall and the one in the security room. He gets his backpack and lets Claude know that he can return.

We meet at the elevator on the first floor. The Cs get their backpacks, I roll the cart back to where it belongs, and we get moving. The mission is on.

We study the map and decide that if we want to find something, anything, we have to go down. All the way down. Even John, who has access to all of the building's cameras, doesn't really know what the hidden underground looks like. If it's under CCTV, he has no access from his office. However, we had some information gathered here and there, and I had pieced it together as good as possible. We know, for example, that we can't just take the elevator down, so we have to find another way.

Claude, for some reason I have forgotten, knows how the vents connect to the lower level, so into the vents we go. Everything up to this point goes smoothly. Until we find what might be an exit to the lower level. With Charlie in the front, he unscrews the vent cover, but the tower wobbles. The DM makes his first move with a grin and tells us that Charlie fails to remove the cover silently - instead, it falls onto the marble floor beneath and makes a lot of noise.

We just jump out and all make it with no more tower-wobbles. It takes no more than 2 minutes and an alarm goes off. The enemy knows we're here. We had hoped it would take them longer, but we did expect trouble. We move fast.

The underground is a labyrinth, and we even almost walk into two traps, but avoid them by sheer luck. John gets a nasty cut thanks to another wobble, but we're fine, it's nothing Claude can't easily fix up. Then, the first encounter. We hide, get our guns ready. We would love not to open fire, but we will if we have to.

Out of the blue, Claude and I are hit by a smoke bomb and go blind for a second. It's John and Charlie's moment to shine. They sneak around the two heavily armed cultists and take them out without even firing a shot. Good. More noise would not benefit us. Meanwhile, I and Claude crawl our way out of the smoke that's burning in our eyes. We need a moment to recover. Charlie and John search the bodies - they are knocked out, not dead, mind you. They find a weird shaped key, no doubt to unlock something important.

As we don't really know how this place looks and where our target exactly was, we decide to search for the door that fits the key.

It's eerily quiet. The alarm doesn't ring anymore, we hear no more footsteps. As if the two cultists we encountered were the only ones here. Good. But also forboding. We are cautious. Another trap later, we find the door. It looks old, ancient almost, despite the fact that everything down here looks modern and polished. Marble, glass, and metal - walls that all look the same, doors that seem like lazily copy-pasted with the exact same distance between each other, each corner looks just as much as the last. But this door is made of old, heavy wood.

And another difference? The room is pitch black. We decide to split. Claude and I search the room, Charlie and John try to map our close surroundings, and plan where to go next.

Charlie thinks he hears a noise, so they decide to investigate as silently as possible, but can't find any living being. The place seems abandoned. They open door after door to be met with similar-looking rooms. It feels like the backrooms.

Until they open a door and are faced with 2 cultists who are in the middle of their prayers in front of a ghastly-looking statue. It had 6 disheveled wings, 3 arms, 8 eyes, and a big hole in the middle of where its stomach is supposed to be. The DM tells Charlie that it looks like all 8 eyes are blinking, while to John, they don't change at all.

Charlie, a little bit unsettled, goes for a Jenga block. He tries to talk to the cultists without alarming them. He succeeds - no wobble. They turn out to be new initiates, not really set in their beliefs. They don't know much about the underground (or they don't want to tell) but they are helpful enough. John advises them to leave and never return. They heed the advice and give Charlie and John a few hints as to where to go next, before they eventually leave.

Meanwhile, Claude and I are being idiots. Real idiots. Flashlight and headlamp equipped, we step into the dark room, just to realize that some sort of magic swallows our light. Great, we are at a place where artifacts are stored! But shit, we can't see anything. So we start by trying to sense our way through the room. The grimoir is a book, yes, but there are approximately 500 books in this room.

We stumble upon different things, nothing too fancy, nothing too important. Whatever artifacts are stored here, they don't interest us. I make a mental note and step outside to update the map, before I go back inside. For an excruciating 10 minutes, we're just stupid and try to find anything that could help us in a pitch-black room. We collide twice.

Enough time for John and Charlie to return. Suddenly, the lights of the room go on. It startles me so much I yelp, and Claude ducks under whatever he can, thinking it's a flash grenade.

""The fuck are you doing?"" Charlie asks, befuddled. ""There was a light switch?"" I ask, realising the magnitude of our idiocy. There was. We didn't even attempt to look for one. The DM described the room to us as a pitchblack. So we turned on our flashlights. He described how the light gets swallowed, and we just ran with it. Because we're idiots. Meanwhile, Charlie just asked the DM: is there a light switch? And the DM goes: Yes, right outside of the room next to the door. Imagine our faces, now imagine them a little more stupid - congrats! You now know how we looked like. But we needed that good OOC laugh.

With the lights on and the group reunited, Charlie and John fill us in. Apparently, the answer to all questions is above, not below. We ask what that means, but John explains that the cultists didn't really know themselves. Funny, I think. They are all about demons and devils, creatures that are known to come from hell, and if the bible was anything to go by, hell was below, not above. So the above was probably less a riddle than facts.

We were on the wrong side of the building - horizontally speaking. But that's just my hunch, so we search the room properly this time. A lot of useless stuff, but we do find old documents. We do not have a lot of time to read them all, but we skim them to learn that this whole building is magical of some sort, built with the help of artifacts.

The DM gives us a riddle hidden between the pages, I can't recall what it was, but in this case, we couldn't just Jenga our way through it, we had to actually think about it and solve it. And John was the one who did. It gave us the location to the grimoir. It was in the office of the CEO, which was located at the very top of the 25-storey officebuilding. My hunch was right.

We had just one problem: How do we get back up? We still didn't know the official way to get in and out of the underground. So this became our next task. We decided to retrack our steps into a hall we had passed through that had seemed strangely central/important. But just as we rounded the corner, we came to learn how to probably get out of here.

One of the walls opens up like a hidden elevator (which it was) and out come 10 heavily armed cultists. They don't ask questions, they open fire on sight. We have handguns, they have rifles. This fight did cost us so many Jenga blocks. John gets injured heavily. I make a call. I launch the fucking C4 into the room, risking blowing up the elevator. It doesn't. The tower doesn't even sway - at this point, it's holding up by sheer willpower. The C4 takes out 5 cultists for good, renders the rest unable to move, and yeets two rifles close enough so Claude can grab them.

We wait for any noise and for the dust to settle. It's silent. I check around the corner. The cultists are too injured to fight. We bolt to the elevator. But just as we're about to get to it, we get swarmed from the corridor we came from.

Dear readers. This is it. And I fear I am not able to do the epicness of this moment justice.

We are rushing, adrenaline dictating our every move. John is panting: ""We'll die here. I am 100% sure that this elevator has a fail-safe. They'll stop it from leaving. They'll execute us on the spot.""

Claude takes off his backpack mid-run and throws it into the elevator. ""You'll make it,"" he stops running and turns to the enemy.

""DM? I start blasting both rifles. My goal is to ensure that the rest of the team has enough time to make it to the upper floor safely and to kill as many cultists as possible while I'm at it.""

The DM nods and calculates how many blocks Claude has to pick from the tower. ""You have to take-""

Claude, dead serious: ""Everything."" And he smashed the tower.

1q8vw1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8vw1w/essential_tips_for_living_next_to_a_university/,essential tips for living next to a university brewery district,"  
hey all, figured i'd share some real talk on what it's like living right in the middle of a brewery and college area. the vibe is amazing but you gotta be ready for some stuff that can get annoying quick.  
  
first up, parking is your number one enemy. seriously. forget street parking on a friday or during a football game. it just disappears. save yourself the sanity and check out an app like prked. you can rent someone's unused driveway or garage a couple blocks away, which is way cheaper and safer than a lot, and you skip the parking chaos entirely. hosts often take care of the car too which is nice. if you actually have an extra spot yourself, list it on prked for passive income, you'll make a ton on weekends.  
  
on the plus side, you're never bored. there's a youthful energy that makes the area super vibrant. you get great, interesting restaurants and coffee shops that stay competitive because of all the students and visitors. my local brewery has concerts and community events all the time, and lectures are often open to the public if you want a free learning experience. plus, if you get lucky with a newer building, some places are actually starting to use the brewery's waste heat to help warm your hot water which is wild and super efficient.  
  
now for the reality check. noise is constant, especially if your apartment faces the main drag or a beer garden. even if a brewery closes earlier than a late-night bar, the sound from crowds, live music, and the trucks making deliveries or dumping glass bottles can be an issue. check local sound ordinances for event nights, as they sometimes allow louder noise, and be prepared for your dishes to rattle during big concerts.  
  
also keep in mind that with more crowds comes some less desirable stuff. you might see more aggressive panhandlers or issues with dwi stops and bar fights, especially on weekend nights. try to stick to an enclosed complex or one that is patrolled by campus or city police for extra peace of mind. and sometimes you get a strong 'hoppy' smell when they're actively brewing, which is fine for some but not everyone likes it.  
  
but honestly, for the walkability and the constant buzz, it's worth the trade-off if you're a city person. you just need earplugs and a good parking plan.  
  
hope this helps.",1,1768023390.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q8vvej,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8vvej/big_list_of_ways_to_use_that_extra_retail_square/,big list of ways to use that extra retail square footage,"  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share a bunch of ideas for anyone sitting on a big chunk of unused retail space in their store or building. it's a huge waste to just have it empty and it really drags down the vibe.  
  
first thing, if you have any extra exterior space like a driveway, unused parking spots, or even a section of your back lot that's secure, you should definitely check out prked. it's a super easy way to make passive income by listing that space for people to rent. you set your own price and schedule, and it's simple to set up. people are always looking for cheaper, convenient parking and it’s a quick win to make some extra cash from what you already have.  
  
for the interior square footage, the options are really diverse:  
  
short-term ideas (easy income stream)  
  
pop-up shops or restaurants: rent a corner to a local artisan, seasonal store, or chef trying out a new concept for a few weeks or months. this brings in new foot traffic for your main business too.  
  
experiential space: turn it into a temporary art gallery, a photo studio for rent, or a showroom for new products. people want experiences now.  
  
film and photo shoots: vacant commercial spaces are often great for commercials, music videos, or photo shoots. you can rent it out for a day or two and make some nice side income.  
  
long-term or full conversion ideas  
  
coworking or flexible office space: since hybrid work is big, you could convert the space into desks and small offices for freelancers or small companies. just add free wi-fi and coffee.  
  
micro-fulfillment center or storage: e-commerce businesses need urban hubs to store inventory and manage last-mile delivery. your location is probably perfect for this. you can even set up secure self-storage lockers.  
  
entertainment and leisure: big box spaces are being converted into things like mini-golf, indoor climbing walls, trampoline parks, or gaming centers. these activities bring families and crowds to the area.  
  
community or educational uses: some empty spots are being repurposed as churches, community colleges, job training centers, or specialized gyms. they often need big, open floor plans.  
  
mixed-use development: if you're a landlord, one of the biggest moves is to convert the upper floors into residential apartments with the retail still on the ground floor. this can completely revitalize an area.  
  
hope this helps you figure out a way to monetize that extra space

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1q8vqpm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8vqpm,I rebuilt my productivity stack every month. Then I realized the app should just... adapt.,"During my PhD, I kept switching between rigid productivity apps and simple notes. Then I realized both were broken. You get locked into either of these modes -

**Structured apps** (habit trackers, Notion databases, fitness apps): Nice dashboards and trackers. But the second your priorities change, the whole system stops working. Reconfigure everything or start over.

**Simple notes** (Apple Notes, voice memos, journals): Totally flexible. You can track anything. But zero intelligence. Just a pile of text that never tells you anything useful.

What you need is the best of both: **the flexibility of notes + the power of structured systems.** So, I spent years building the system where the interface rebuilds itself based on what you actually care about. Finally, it is ready to share.

**How EON works:**

You track like it's notes or just talk to it. ""Log my morning routine."" ""I'm trying a magnesium supplement at night."" ""Energy crash at 3 pm.""

But behind the scenes, it connects your wearables, calendar, screen time, workouts, nutrition, and lots of other data sources automatically. Finds patterns: ""Your focus crashes correlate with inconsistent dinner timing more than sleep quality"" or ""Magnesium supplement improves your HRV.""

**When your priorities change, the system adapts:**

""Show me screen time last night vs. sleep"" → Interface generates instantly

""Track my mood this week"" → Builds you a mood tracker

""What affects my afternoon energy?"" → Analysis surfaces

In essence, you're not locked into someone else's dashboard but evolving your own.

**I am looking for users who:**

* Have outgrown rigid productivity systems
* Are tired of tracking without insights
* Want something that evolves as their focus changes

>I have a small number of **PROMO CODES** for a one-month premium and free credits that renew lifetime, and would love to share them with those interested in using the app! Comment below and I will share the code with you.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q8vj38,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8vj38/how_to_make_extra_money_near_college_for_tuition/,how to make extra money near college for tuition and living costs,"  
  
hey there, i figured i'd share a few solid ways to make money near campus since i've been in the same boat trying to cover tuition and books. the key is super flexible hours so you can still focus on classes.  
  
first thing, since you live close to campus, if you have any extra space like a driveway, garage, or even a spare corner in a storage unit, you can turn that into passive income. list the extra space on prked as a host. students and people visiting the university are constantly looking for parking that is closer and way cheaper than the campus garages. you set your own price and schedule, so it’s super low effort. it's an easy setup to make steady money from space you're not even using.  
  
for more active income, tutoring is always a winner. if you aced a subject, charge for an hour or two a week. you can do it right in a campus library or a coffee shop. online tutoring is also huge now and lets you work from your apartment anytime.  
  
dog walking and pet sitting are really flexible too. a lot of people near campus work full-time and need a dog walked mid-day or on weekends. apps like wag or rover make it easy to find clients right in your neighborhood.  
  
delivery driving for services like doordash or ubereats works great around a college schedule. you can log on for the dinner rush, log off for a study session, and then log back on later. same goes for odd jobs like house cleaning, furniture assembly, or running errands on an app like taskrabbit. people are always willing to pay a student for a couple hours of help with quick tasks.  
  
lastly, try to look for campus-affiliated jobs or work-study positions. they are usually designed to work perfectly with your class schedule, and your boss will totally understand if you need time off for finals. a lot of the on-campus positions also pay better than minimum wage.  
  
hope this helps you pay those bills and focus on school. good luck with the semester!",1,1768022259.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q8vj2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1q8vj2u/how_to_tell_if_someone_likes_you_the_psychology/,How to Tell if Someone LIKES You: The Psychology Behind Attraction Signals You Keep Missing,"I dug into psychology research, body language studies, and relationship science to figure out what actually means something versus what we just overanalyze.

Here’s what consistently shows up.

## The stuff that actually means something

* **They remember oddly specific details about you.**  
Not your job or birthday. The random story you told once about your childhood dog or how you hate cilantro. Attraction boosts memory encoding. When someone likes you, their brain treats your details as important without effort. If they casually bring something up weeks later, that’s not coincidence.

* **Their body turns toward you.**  
Eye contact matters, but body orientation matters more. Watch their feet and torso. People subconsciously face what they want to engage with. This is called “fronting” in body language research and it happens automatically when someone feels drawn to you.

* **They keep ending up near you.**  
Sudden shared coffee breaks. Sitting next to you when other seats are open. “Funny running into you” moments that happen a little too often. People create proximity when they’re interested. Patterns matter more than excuses.

* **Mirroring shows up naturally.**  
They start matching your posture, speech rhythm, or energy level. This is the chameleon effect, documented in social psychology. We unconsciously sync with people we want to bond with. If it happens repeatedly, it’s not accidental.

* **Their behavior shifts around you.**  
Some people get quieter and awkward. Others get louder and more confident. Either way, their baseline changes. In *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, attraction is shown to activate the nervous system differently depending on attachment style. Anxious types may lean in hard. Avoidant types may stay guarded but keep showing up.

* **Touch happens in small, plausible ways.**  
Brief arm touches. Hand brushes. Casual shoulder taps. Research on haptic communication shows people test physical closeness with low-risk contact when they’re attracted. It’s subtle boundary testing, not randomness.

* **They communicate differently with you.**  
Faster replies. Longer messages. Actual curiosity. They initiate. They send things that reminded them of you. Digital behavior is one of the clearest indicators of interest. People invest time where interest exists.

* **Their friends act off around you.**  
Awkward smiles. Knowing looks. Sudden exits that leave you alone together. If someone has feelings, their friends usually know. And humans are terrible at pretending otherwise.

* **They open up emotionally.**  
Not trauma dumping. Real vulnerability. Fears, doubts, personal stories. Brené Brown’s research shows we selectively open up to people we want closer bonds with. Emotional access is rarely casual.

* **They talk in future tense.**  
“We should try that place.” “Next time we hang out.” “You’d love this event.” Future-oriented language signals imagined continuity. People don’t subconsciously plan futures with people they feel neutral about.

Attraction evolved to be indirect. Direct rejection used to carry real social risk, so humans developed signals instead of declarations. That’s why this stuff feels confusing.

BeFreed helped me connect a lot of these patterns without spiraling. It’s an AI learning app that turns psychology books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. You can ask about attraction psychology, attachment styles, or communication patterns, then adjust between quick summaries or deeper dives. It also adapts based on what you focus on, which makes learning this stuff way less overwhelming.

But here’s the honest part.

If you’re seeing multiple signs consistently, not just once, someone probably likes you. And if you like them back, clarity beats guessing. Reading signals forever is exhausting.

Sometimes the most psychologically sound move is just being direct.",3,1768022258.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

- Some important points:
 1. Yes, Dr. Venturelli had previously given an interview account 3 years ago in which he said he had only seen the creature via a tape (through a doctor friend), but at the time he was still working at the hospital and was trying to release some information while protecting his career and reputation. 

2. After retiring and having serious health problems that almost killed him last year (heart attack and prostate cancer), he decided to tell what he really saw that day, regardless of the consequences. He claims he cannot die without his grandchildren knowing that extraterrestrial life really exists.  

3. Dr. Venturelli's credentials are well known; he worked in Varginha hospitals for over 40 years and even served as director of the city's three hospitals during his career. His family is well-known throughout the region; his wife and children are also doctors, and they also have a coffee farming and production businesses.

1q8vda9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FloydsBlinds/comments/1q8vda9/motorized_roller_blinds_worth_investing_today/,Motorized Roller Blinds: Worth Investing Today,"Smart home technology is transforming the way we interact with our living spaces. One of the most popular upgrades is motorized roller blinds, which offer a perfect blend of convenience, energy efficiency, and modern aesthetics. But are they really worth the investment? For residents in Dubai, where intense sunlight, high temperatures, and luxury living are key considerations, [motorized blinds](https://floydsblindsandcurtains.com/) can be a game-changer. 

# How Do Motorized Blinds Work? 

These blinds are powered by a small, quiet motor installed within the roller tube. They can be operated through: 

* **Remote control** – For simple push-button operation. 
* **Smartphone app** – Allows scheduling and remote adjustments. 
* **Voice assistants** – Compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. 
* **Home automation systems** – Integrates with smart hubs like SmartThings or HomeKit. 

# Benefits of Motorized Roller Blinds

**1. Convenience & Ease of Use**

No more tugging on cords or struggling to adjust blinds manually. With [motorized blinds in Dubai](https://floydsblindsandcurtains.com/motorized-blinds-dubai/), you can open or close them with a single tap on your phone or a voice command, perfect for hard-to-reach windows or large glass panels. 

**2. Energy Efficiency & Temperature Control**

Dubai’s intense sunlight can heat up interiors quickly, increasing AC usage. Motorized blinds can be scheduled to close during peak sunlight hours, reducing heat gain and lowering energy bills. Some advanced models even adjust automatically based on sunlight sensors.

**3. Enhanced Privacy & Security**

With automated scheduling, your blinds can open and close at set times, giving the impression that someone is home, even when you’re away. This deters potential intruders while maintaining privacy.

**4. Smart Home Integration**

Motorized roller blinds can sync with other smart devices. Imagine waking up to blinds that open gradually with your smart lighting and coffee machine, all controlled via a single app or voice command.

**5. Sleek, Cord-Free Design**

Traditional blinds have cords that can pose safety risks for children and pets. Motorized blinds eliminate this hazard while offering a minimalist, modern look that complements contemporary interiors. 

**6. Increased Property Value**

Smart home features are a selling point in Dubai’s luxury real estate market. Installing motorized roller blinds can enhance your home’s appeal and resale value. 

# Motorized Blinds vs. Traditional Blinds 

While motorized blinds offer numerous benefits, they do come at a higher initial cost compared to traditional blinds. Factors affecting the price include the type of motor (battery-powered vs. hardwired), fabric material (blackout, UV-protective, or sheer), and smart features like Wi-Fi connectivity and solar compatibility.  

However, the long-term savings in energy bills, added convenience, and potential increase in property value often justify the investment. For those in Dubai looking to save on costs, battery-operated or solar-powered motorized blinds are practical alternatives, and many local suppliers offer seasonal discounts and professional installation services. 

Motorized blinds provide effortless operation, better energy efficiency, and enhanced safety, while traditional blinds are more affordable but lack smart features. In a city like Dubai, where luxury and technology go hand in hand, motorized roller blinds are an excellent upgrade for homes, offices, and commercial spaces. They are particularly useful in areas with large windows, skylights, or rooms where light control is essential. 

# Are Motorized Roller Blinds Worth It? 

If you value convenience, energy savings, and a modern home aesthetic, motorized roller blinds are a worthwhile investment, especially in a sun-drenched city like Dubai. While the upfront cost is higher than traditional blinds, the long-term benefits in comfort, security, and efficiency make them a smart choice for homeowners and businesses alike. 

# Bottom Line 

Looking to upgrade your windows with the latest in smart home technology? Floyds Blinds and Curtains Dubai specializes in high-quality motorized blinds, offering custom designs, professional installation, and seamless smart home integration.

1q8vbj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q8vbj6/just_another_summer_in_95/,Just Another Summer In ‘95,"I want to say this happened in the early summer when our park was full of hikers, campers, and tourists. Montana had its beauty in those summer months, so I couldn’t blame them.

A lot of the tourists hadn’t spent a day camping or even been backpacking. A lot of them hopped out of their cars to take close-up pictures of bison, so you can imagine we had a fair share of people getting lost. Hell, most of the time when I was on tower duty for the summer, I had to guide lost hikers back to the trail instead of watching for wildfires.

I always pictured being a park ranger as a relaxing job, and that was the case in ’94, before everything happened. We didn’t think much of it at first. There seemed to be more cases of rabies, more wildlife we had to put down, which had us carrying our .38 with us whenever we went out, putting more rifles in our trucks. I used to complain about having that heavy wheel gun hanging from my hip. It was heavy and got in the way of a pack and made my hips chafe sometimes. I wasn’t really used to carrying around a gun; I had only shot one maybe a few times. I stopped complaining after what happened in June.

Then we had the first incident at the start of the tour season. I was lying in my cot at the station, fast asleep, when the phone rang. I grumbled as I sat up and grabbed the phone.

“Hello?” I asked in a groggy voice.

I recognized my supervisor’s voice on the other end of the line.

“Hey Ash, we got a call at one of the campgrounds—some kind of disturbance going on there.”

I brushed my bangs out of my face as I held the phone in the crook of my neck.

“What kind of disturbance?” I asked, furrowing my brow slightly.

I heard my supervisor sigh through the slight static.

“Some people making a huge ruckus after quiet hours. Sounded like some rowdy kids blaring Nirvana.”

I yawned and quickly covered my mouth with my free hand.

“Who else is going down there?” I asked as I kicked the blankets off my body.

“Hmm. I have Felix on the way over, so I just need you to go with him. They’re probably drunk, so don’t get yourself hurt.”

I chuckled softly and tapped my foot on the edge of the cot.

“All I’m gonna do is tell them to turn down the music in my fancy uniform, Jake.”

He snorted softly at this. “Yeah, sure, killer. Sorry about waking you up for this, but a lot of the overnighters are tied up on tower duty. The other seasonals haven’t really started pouring in yet.”

I let out a sigh. “Same old story then. I’ll call you after I deal with it. Won’t take long. You have a good night, right? Tell Lauren I said hi.”

“Thanks, Ash, you have a good night too.”

I hung up the phone and made my way to my locker. It didn’t take me long to change into my uniform. I slipped on my jacket and grabbed my duty belt. I left that stupid wide-brimmed hat and just opted to wear the baseball-cap version I brought last summer.

The station was pretty quiet this time, and I made sure to grab a jolt from the fridge before I headed out. I had a feeling tonight would be a long night of paperwork—probably would need a second one before dawn, knowing me. Not to mention the coffee at the station tasted like dirt.

I passed Mel at the front desk, wearing a Walkman, probably listening to whatever they constantly blared on MTV while flipping through the glossy pages of the newest issue of Seventeen. She looked at me and gave me a wave as I returned it on my way out the door.

The lot was pretty deserted compared to how it gets later in the season. There were only two patrol trucks, mine and Mel’s; besides everyone’s personal cars, of course. Jake really wasn’t kidding about being short-staffed.

There was no wind that night—I remember that distinctly more than anything else. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. The moon hung low in the pitch-black night. The only sound I could hear in that quiet parking lot was a great-horned owl hooting in the distant treeline, as well as my set of keys jingling on my belt as I walked to my truck.

I cracked open the can of Jolt as I put my keys in the ignition and let my truck rumble to life. I pulled out of the lot onto the gravel road and began to drive. I turned on my radio and tuned into the nearest station; one of those late-night stations with a barely-awake DJ mumbling out song names. This happened to be playing eighties pop—could be worse, I suppose.

My headlights were my only source of light on those winding back-country roads. I was glad to be used to traversing the rough roads here. It wasn’t long before I reached the campgrounds. Despite being early in the season, the campgrounds were still pretty packed.

I pulled through the checkpoint, passing the worn-out volunteer stuck on gate duty. There weren’t many lights on at this time of night; the only lighting I could make out from the hazy windows of my truck was from the sparsely placed streetlights and the dim orange glow from dying campfires. I turned around a small bend in the road to see at least four cars crammed into a parking space meant for three. Several tents were set up in random spots around the campsite. Most of them didn’t even look like they were staked in properly.

Even from the road I could hear the music blaring from some boombox they had near the still-burning campfire. What already stuck out to me was that there wasn’t anyone out and about. Sure, it was late, but the fire was still going pretty strong. Someone had fed it within an hour or two. Had they just been so drunk they passed out in their tents?

There wasn’t long to debate what could have happened when I saw a pair of headlights approaching in my rearview mirror. I quickly recognized it to be one of our trucks. I put my own truck in park and killed the engine. I stepped out and gave a wave to Felix’s truck as I heard the sound of a car door opening and closing. I heard a softer-spoken voice.

“I thought you were gonna get some sleep tonight?”

I shrugged as I saw the tall form of Felix saunter into view in his faded uniform. “So did I, but here I am.”

“Jake’s doing, I’m guessing?” he asked as he rubbed his unshaven chin.

I sighed and nodded my head, and Felix gave me a sympathetic smile as he motioned for me to follow him. We both took out our flashlights and began to walk toward the campsite.

“I wouldn’t worry about it, Ashley. It’s only your second summer here after all.”

I nodded in agreement as I boot crunched a pine cone in half. “I know, but it feels like I’m left holding the bag sometimes.”

Felix scratched the back of his neck. “It might seem like that, but he’s doing this for a reason.”

I tilted my head slightly as I looked over at him. “He’s testing me,” I mused aloud. Felix snapped his calloused fingers and flashed a grin.

“See—you’re a smart girl. Think about it, how many out-of-towners flood this place with applications every summer?”

“A lot,” I responded as I pondered where he was going with this.

“Gotta weed out who can’t stick it out here.”

“Makes sense. I guess I am a long way from San Diego.”

He chuckled softly. “Miss the palm trees and beaches?”

“Nope. And don’t miss the traffic either.”

We both shared a soft chuckle as we entered the campsite, clearing our throats and putting our minds back to the task at hand. Felix called out in a professional, practiced voice that we were rangers with the park and needed them to turn down the music since it was past quiet hour.

We didn’t get a response. I shined my light around the campsite and noticed several camp chairs set up outside the radius of the fire’s glow. A few were knocked over, to no surprise. I saw some empty cans of Blue Ribbon and a few half-finished bottles of Jack Daniels. All classic choices for teens who didn’t understand what good booze was yet.

I took a few more steps into the campsite. The boombox was still blaring “Smells Like Teen Spirit” in the deserted campsite. I quickly picked up the scent of cigarettes from a still-lit cigarette resting in a crowded ashtray on a picnic table. Something wasn’t right here. Sure, they could be passed out asleep in their tents, but all these cars, all these tents, all these empty chairs—and not a single one is a snorer after a long night of drinking?

There was only silence in response to Felix’s announcement. We both exchanged looks even in the darkness of the unusual night; there was a hint of worry in the experienced ranger’s eyes. He quieted his voice and got a more focused glint in his eyes that I hadn’t seen before.

“Come on, let’s check the tents if anyone is in there.”

I nodded in agreement as I shined my light on the nearby tents. We both split off to check the tents for any occupants. I announced myself before zipping open a tent, expecting to find a drunken couple deep in the moment. But all I saw were empty sleeping bags, scattered magazines, and half-open duffel bags. Some had clothes scattered around on the tent floor—definitely kids my age. The only thing missing were the hammered frat guys sleeping away a night of boozing. I checked the other tents to find more or less the same.

Felix and I met back up near the campfire, both of us not finding the campers yet.

“It’s like they all just wandered off,” I said softly to him.

“They couldn’t have gone far; cars are still here.” He rubbed his chin thoughtfully as he shined his beam near the edge of the campsite. He seemed to focus on something I couldn’t see very well from the angle I was looking at it.

“Ash, come look at this,” he said as he walked over toward the edge of the campsite, shining the beam of his flashlight at something on the ground. I made my way over to his side.

“What is it?” I inquired as I squinted at what he was looking at.

“See some prints going into the woods—kinda looks like some drag marks too. There’s some wildlife tracks, too.”

“Drag marks?” I replied, furrowing my brow.

“Yeah… looks pretty fresh, too,” he added, a frown forming on his face.

“Think we should call Jake about this?”

Felix took in a deep breath as if in thought for a moment. “Not yet. I need to grab something from my truck—come on.”

I followed him to his truck; a sense of unease had begun to descend on me ever since we found the empty campsite. At this time I didn’t know why.

Felix opened the back door and dug through a large duffel. I almost asked what he was looking for—then he pulled it out. A strange rifle, loading it with a stripper clip of .308s.

It wasn’t like the long, sleek rifles in the glossy Cabela’s catalogs that came in the mail. This one was almost ugly. The wood was worn and unpolished, the barrel stubby but menacing, like it had come from another era. He racked the bolt with a sharp motion, then turned and looked back at me.

“What? It’s bear country, Ash.”

“Is that what you think happened? A grizzly snatched them?”

“I don’t know.” He sighed and rubbed his face with his free hand. “We do need to make sure they’re okay. I know if I called Jake he would just write it off or make us wait for hours till county gets here.”

“He would, so let’s give him something he can’t ignore.” He said as he put his flashlight back on his belt and replaced it with a headlamp.

We both set out to follow the drag marks. We didn’t say anything as we began to walk into the shadowy treeline.

Every couple of steps we called out if anyone was out there and if they were lost. Our voices reverberated across the pines. We shone our lights around our surroundings, looking for any signs of these drunk college kids. The night was still, soundless. Not even a single bird or bug could be heard. I couldn’t even feel any soft gusts of wind. I kept listening for the smallest sound, any kind of sign of someone lost out there.

I felt my stomach begin to swirl. We couldn’t even hear the music anymore—it was like the air itself was siphoning the sounds of the night away.

That’s when I finally saw it, hiding in a collection of vegetation. A pair of eyes staring back at me. I shined my light at it and my eyes widened. A young, teary-eyed woman stared back at me with blond hair like mine. She was kneeling down by a man that looked to be around the same age as her. A large, seeping gash was ripped across his leg. He didn’t seem to be conscious from the blood loss. One of the woman’s petite hands was tightly pressed against his wound; her other hand clutched his. Her face was deathly pale; I could see her whole body was shaking. She seemed to struggle to keep her breathing under control. Several times she kept opening and closing her mouth to say something to us, but her words refused to leave her mouth. She had several small cuts adorning her exposed arms. Her delicate face was cut up like she had been scratched by branches from a hasty escape. Who I assumed to be her boyfriend had similar cuts on his face.

I felt frozen in place as I put a hand to my mouth. I kept screaming at my legs to move but they wouldn’t; in fact, I couldn’t feel them at all. That girl’s face—desperate for anything, anyone that could escape this horrible place. I finally swallowed my fear and sprang into action—and so did Felix. I kneeled down beside the couple and set my bag down. I practically ripped it open to get my first-aid kit out.

Felix was faster than me; his hands were shaking less than mine. I yanked out some four-by-four gauze and started to press it into the wound as Felix started to get out some roller gauze and help me wrap the wound up. The girl still clutched his hand for dear life, never leaving his side.

I had to gently move her hand aside from the wound so I could help Felix bandage it up. She didn’t ever raise her voice or make much of a sound besides some almost-inaudible murmurs. Even though I couldn’t make out her exact words, I could tell she was praying.

“Ash, take care of him. I got him,” he said as he quickly took control of the situation. I took the woman’s bloodied hand into my own, not giving a shit about the blood right now. She turned her gaze to me, asking a silent question.

“We’ll take care of him, don’t worry,” I said in my best reassuring voice.

She quickly nodded and finally released her iron grip on her boyfriend’s hand. Felix quickly hefted the young man over his shoulder and nodded to me.

“Thank you…” the girl murmured to me as she held onto my hand tightly like it was her only escape.

“Come on, we need to go, okay?” I said gently to her as her green eyes flickered over to the trees deeper into the woods.

“But my friends are still out there!” she finally raised her voice to my surprise. Felix noticed my hesitation and answered for me.

“Look, miss, we need to get him to a hospital or he won’t make it. We’re gonna call for more rangers to find your friends, alright?”

This seemed to satisfy her well enough and she nodded a few times and sniffed.

“Right, I’m sorry—I just—”

“It’s alright, you don’t need to apologize. Let’s get you out of here.” I added as Felix started to jog back with the wounded man still over his shoulder. I led the terrified girl through the darkness by her trembling hand, flashlight in my other. I could hear Felix’s heavy footsteps crunching pine needles ahead of me.

“Are they gonna be okay?” she asked anxiously, her eyes darting all around.

“They’ll be okay,” I replied, not believing my own word. Even though I was definitely not alone, I felt something else—I didn’t even know how to describe it.

I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I could feel eyes bearing their gaze upon me, but I couldn’t tell from where. I quickened my pace slightly, tugging on the girl’s arm to get her to move a bit faster.

“What’s your name?” I asked her, trying to take my mind off this sensation.

She hesitated for a few moments before finally speaking up.

“Jessica.” She tried to add a smile, but her nerves failed her.

“I’m Ash; the big guy who grabbed your boyfriend is Felix,” I said, looking over my shoulder at her with a soft smile. She slowly returned the smile with some hesitation.

I could tell we were getting close to the campsite by the sounds of grunge rock echoing through the shadowy trees.

We finally reached the dim glow of the campfire. I could see Felix by his truck with the young man laid out on the truck bed with the hastily made bandage now wrapped in Coban.

Felix stood close by, one hand resting on the edge of the truck bed, the other holding the receiver of an old Motorola bag phone. The bulky nylon case sat beside him, the coiled cord stretched just far enough to let him pace a little. I assumed he was calling Jake—or someone from the emergency line—but I couldn’t tell. His voice was low, tight. Whatever he was saying wasn’t for me.

Jess broke away from my grip and ran over to her boyfriend’s side. Even though he was still unresponsive, I could see his chest rising and falling, the slight vibrations in his chest from his still-beating heart.

As Felix was busy, I walked over to the boombox and finally shut it off. I turned back and made my way over to Jess’s side as she tapped her fingers on her boyfriend’s open palm. I finally asked the question that had been circling like a vulture on my mind this entire time.

“What exactly happened out there?”

I asked as I rested my arms on the top side of the truck bed. Jessica’s eyes averted mine as she stared at the ground.

“I don’t know…where to even start,” she said as she rubbed her face. I quietly waited for her to continue as I pressed a hand to her shoulder.

“One second we were drinking, having fun…then it was just—”

She paused as she wiped her eyes, taking a moment to compose herself.

“The music was so loud but I could still hear Eric screaming when it grabbed him.”

“Something grabbed him? An animal? A person?”

“I don’t know, I never got a good look at it. It started to drag him into the woods and…my legs just started moving on their own. I don’t know what came over me.”

I took a notepad out and started scribbling some notes as she spoke. It helped keep my shaking hands busy.

“What about your friends? Did they do the same?”

She gave me a short nod.

“They did, but I was first. I saw so much red. I grabbed the pocket knife he gave me for my sixteenth. I just stabbed it…again and again. It made such awful sounds—”

“Did…you kill it?” I asked with a raised eyebrow, and she gave me a slight shrug.

“I don’t know, but it let him go and everyone just scattered. I panicked—we all did. I didn’t know what to do besides hide and hope it didn’t find us again. It sounded like it was screaming like a person when I stabbed it.”

I stopped writing and looked up at her, truly at a loss about what she was describing. None of it made any sense to me. My only guess was a mountain lion or some psycho. Both sounded far-fetched the more I thought about it. Mountain lions prefer easy prey—people alone, isolated—not a packed campsite full of noise, even if they were starving.

Perhaps it was a person? Some kind of deranged psycho living in the woods, targeting clueless campers? Sounded like the plot of some shitty slasher—one with a masked serial killer. Then again, he would be a pretty bad one if all it took to stop him was a half-sober, petrified sorority girl with a pocket knife that probably hadn’t been used for anything besides cutting nails and whittling out of boredom.

A silence fell on us as we quietly waited for our backup. Felix stood closest to the wood’s edge with his rifle propped up on his truck. Every couple of minutes, he would turn on his headlamp and scan the treeline; he never saw anything. I draped a blanket around Jess—she wouldn’t stop shivering. Even as the minutes drew by, what felt like hours, my hands wouldn’t stop shaking, but I didn’t know why. The woods still didn’t make a sound even as I felt a gentle breeze brush upon my face.

Finally, we all heard the sound of approaching sirens in the distance. All three of us peeked our heads up. Our backup was here after what felt like an eternity. I first noticed the red flashing lights from a county ambulance with peeling paint, followed by a couple of our trucks—not the dull flashing amber lights like I had on my truck, just like your run-of-the-mill city cop, they had red and blue lights flashing brightly against the cedars and pines. At the back of this convoy was a single black-and-white county patrol car; I was honestly surprised they bothered to send one out here—must have been a slow night.

They quickly pulled into the turnoff for one of the empty campsites and killed the wailing of their sirens. The rangers stepped out first. They didn’t dress like us. Felix and I wore cargo shorts, faded T-shirts, tired polos with cheap name tags pinned on, and dusty hiking boots. These rangers wore tan collared shirts and dark green cargo pants, black Danners. I noticed quickly some wore those detestable wide-brimmed hats but a lot of them only wore baseball caps. Each of them wore a high-vis vest stamped with “LAW ENFORCEMENT” in large bold letters. They slung scoped game rifles or semi-auto shotguns—likely loaded with bear slugs—over their shoulders. A few of them carried bulkier, heavy-duty tranquilizer rifles with longer scopes. I noticed clunky handheld radios dangled from their belts. No doubt these were the usual guys they called in when the wildlife got bold. They didn’t say anything to us but Felix said we could help look for the missing campers.

These weren’t the rangers that smiled and waved from behind desks at the visitor centers or handed out trail maps at junctions. These were the guys you called to track and kill a thousand-pound grizzly that mauled a camper. These were the guys who carried bodies out of ravines. They worked in places where the nearest backup was hours away.

Small crowds began to gather, drawn by the lights and sirens screaming in well after quiet hours. Barefoot kids peeked out from dome-shaped Power Rangers tents, Game Boys in hand. The soft, sickly golden glow from their wormlights illuminated quietly worried faces. Flannel-clad dads sat in folding chairs outside their RVs, Miller High Lifes still cold from the cooler, trading guesses about why all the uniforms were out here. Mothers in hoodies gently tried to herd their kids back to bed. The flashing lights painted the pines in red and blue long after the sirens had gone quiet.

I looked over at the ambulance as two guys in plain navy-cargo pants and windbreakers carted away Eric on a stretcher with Jess hovering close by. One of the newly arrived rangers handed us some handheld radios and muttered something about not chasing after grizzly bears. They turned on dark green angle lights clipped to their vests and split into pairs as they carefully entered the treeline, their rifles held low. Our radios crackled with their chatter.

“Station, this is Ranger 8. We’re gonna need SAR volunteers rounded up to cover this much ground—over.”

“Copy that, we’ll assemble a search party. Standby.”

“10-4.”

I turned down the volume on my radio as Felix and I ended up being paired off together. I noticed the deputy they dragged along with them was talking to another guy not in any kind of uniform—button-up shirt and slacks with a badge clipped to his belt. A sidearm was concealed in a leather shoulder holster. I assumed he was some kind of detective. Not sure what he was gonna investigate in this neck of the woods.

I was sure this was just another rabid animal to be put down, just like the other reports. Felix still took the lead, the rifle hanging over his chest. I was glad to be paired up with him—from the way he was able to follow those tracks from before. All those hunting trips he had been taking with his son had finally paid off. I was a little bit jealous after the fact I never figured out why.

As we were walking under the shadowy arms of the spruces, flashlights in hand, I first smelled it—something that struck out from the usual scents of the forests of Montana. There was hardly even wind to carry it, so it took a second for me to register what I was smelling. Honestly, it was pretty repulsive when it finally hit me. I caught a whiff of what smelled like ammonia, like someone had been pouring jugs of bleach out in the middle of the woods.

I looked down to see if it had been something I had stepped on. I furrowed my brow as the dull golden beam of my flashlight reflected the sight of clotted droplets of blood clinging to pine needles and fallen leaves. The droplets continued down the makeshift game trail. Neither of us said a word to each other. Felix muttered a short transmission into the radio. He turned to me and we just exchanged a nod and kept going.

The smell only got stronger as we kept walking. The blood started to get more visible—going from sparse drops to scattered puddles. Felix started walking slower, taking more deliberate steps now, heel to toe, muffling the stomping of his boots crunching pine needles.

We finally reached the end of the blood trail. The smell was almost unbearable now; I felt lightheaded from the overwhelming stench.

We both stopped in our tracks at what we heard. From the sounds I could hear it making—how it wheezed—I could tell it was struggling to stay alive. It emitted a series of harsh gasps and sputters. I felt like I was about to throw up from even being near it. I squinted my eyes as I finally could make out where the sounds were coming from. A shadowy shape lay on its side staring at us from under a birch. Even though I couldn’t see its eyes I could feel them bearing their weight down on my skull.

I swallowed my nausea and fear and finally shined my flashlight on it. Our eyes widened at what we saw. I wanted to run away from this thing and never think about it, bury it out of mind, but my primal focus seemed to take hold.

I would have thought it was an elk if I had just glanced at it for a split second. But it wasn’t one—at least not anymore. It used to be a bull, still had those velvety furred antlers from an early summer. Its eyes were what struck me the most. They were clouded, colorless, like a corpse. I couldn’t even tell if they had pupils anymore. Its eyes kept twitching almost like they were loose in their sockets, about to pop out at any moment.

It was still laid out on its side. Its head raised to continue to gaze at us. Some of its fur was matted with blood; it looked like its own blood. Its jaws were entirely misshapen. I was about to wonder why when I got my answer. It opened its gaping maw—it had too many teeth. Rows and rows of newly grown incisors were tightly crammed into its original set of teeth, like a shark’s. Its newly grown teeth were coated in fresh blood. The sounds it made were like it was gurgling and choking on its blood. That’s when I finally noticed where Jess made her mark: sticking out from between its collarbone and shoulder was the hilt of a buck knife, blood still seeping from the fresh wound.

I shined my light down to its legs as it began to move. All four of its legs were bent and twisted into horrible angles; its length extended beyond the realm of possibility. Bones jutted out like spikes from its horribly mangled limbs. Despite the fact that it shouldn’t have been able to stand, let alone move at all, it still did.

Even with the distance between me and that thing, I still heard its legs crack and crunch as limbs began to snap and break in new ways with each passing moment. It should have been screaming, howling in agony, but it didn’t make a sound. It only let out soft retching and a sound of gagging. I felt bile begin to travel up my throat with every bone it snapped further into impossible angles.

Felix still had the rifle. “C-cover your ears,” he commanded with a slight wavering in his voice.

I didn’t question it or hesitate to do as he said.

I could tell Felix was trying to put on a brave face around me—not because he wanted to look macho or impress me or anything. He knew I would panic if a veteran ranger like him lost his cool. I could still hear it in his voice, the slight hesitation in his words. His normally tanned face was as pale as that thing’s eyes.

It was in the process of walking forward when I finally heard the deafening roar from Felix’s rifle. It didn’t seem to register that it had been shot. A gaping hole was now barreled in between its eyes—Felix wasn’t bullshitting about those hunting stories after all. Blood began to bleed from its new wound. It sat on its haunches and flexed its jaw a few times as it rocked its head up and down. It crumpled over to the side and began kicking its back legs wildly; after less than thirty seconds it let out a few more twitches before falling motionless entirely. A puddle of blood began to form under its slaw jawed face. Our radios started to squawk with questions on who fired that shot.

We both let out a collected breath that we had been holding this entire time. I heard the sound of Felix charging the bolt and ejecting the still-smoking brass from the chamber.

The scent of ammonia began to fade away as the scent of carbon and gunpowder filled my nostrils. I didn’t say anything, but with trembling hands he grabbed his radio and spoke into it.

“All stations… one round fired. Aggressive wildlife is down. Situation is… under control.”

There was a long silence on the air, and Felix spoke again, “Bring gloves.”

“10-4.”

I reached into my pack and got something I didn’t think I would be using at this moment but felt compelled to do. I grabbed my Polaroid camera.

It was a gift from Mom two summers ago before I left. I promised her I would take pictures of the park for her. I hung up pictures of hot springs in my locker—the breathtaking views of the snow-covered mountains and extinct volcanos from the balcony of a lonely firetower. I sent them back to Cali in half-crumpled envelopes. I never thought I would take a picture like… this.

The camera’s flash filled my vision as my camera spit out a newly printed Polaroid. I began to shake the photo as it developed. A small comfort was brought from doing such a mundane and familiar task. I expected Felix to say some cheesy one-liner from a trashy action movie to cut the tension, but he never did.

I looked over at him—the rifle now slung over his shoulder. He clutched it tightly, his fingers trembling, knuckles snow-white. I could hear his soft, unsteady breathing.

I reached out, quietly, and rested my hand on his arm.

He flinched at first, his head twitching toward me on instinct.

I didn’t pull away. Instead, I tightened my grip just a little.

He closed his eyes. Breathed in. Breathed out.

Then he nodded. “I’m fine, I just—” he softly murmured, not finishing his sentence.

I gently caressed his forearm with my fingertips before pulling my hand back. My fingers were still shaking.

The sound of dry leaves crunching approached us as the beams of two flashlights drew near.

We looked over to see two law-enforcement rangers walking quietly up to the body of the thing.

I expected them to say something as they shined their beams over what lay there, but they didn’t. One of them nodded at Felix, who still held the rifle, the barrel smoking ever so slightly.

The taller ranger set his bag down and pulled a bright-yellow Kodak from a smaller compartment inside a Ziploc bag.

He raised the camera and took a quick photo with a soft snap as the flash lit up the carcass. He stepped closer, focusing the lens on the hilt of the knife. Then he stowed the camera in his cargo pocket and scribbled down the frame number and a short note in a small notebook before giving a nod to the second ranger.

The second ranger unfolded a black tarp from his pack and draped it over the misshapen elk. He cracked a blue chemlight and taped it to the tarp with a strip of surveyor’s tape. One of them reached for his shoulder mic and spoke into it.

“Station, this is Ranger Three. We got a DB flagged with a blue chemlight. Northwest—eight hundred meters into the treeline, over.”

“Copy. DB marked with a blue chemlight. Southwest—eight hundred meters in, out.”

Neither Felix nor I said a word. I expected them to lose their composure, to stammer out some half-witted explanation of what we were looking at. But they didn’t. I could have sworn I heard one of them mutter another one under their breath.

This wasn’t their first time.

One of them finally looked over at us. “You two, head back. Jake’s waiting for you by the trucks.”

Felix nodded quietly. I didn’t move. He started to walk away but quickly noticed I wasn’t following—I was still staring at that tarp, the misshapen cloven hooves just barely visible from the edges. Felix put a hand on my back and gently urged me forward.

“C’mon, Ash…” he said quietly. I silently nodded and followed him back toward the trucks.

We didn’t say anything to each other during the walk back, but Felix was walking a bit slower than before. He kept the rifle close, holding it tightly. As we walked, he would shine his light in the trees as we passed them, but we never saw anything.

The flashing lights guided us through the quiet forest. It didn’t take long for us to get back to the campsite and all those emergency vehicles; the crowd was still there now, a few more strong after the gunshot they probably heard.

Among the lines of emergency was the shape of my supervisor—Jake was leaning up against his truck, reds and blues painting his face as he took a long drag from a lit cigarette while he spoke to what I assumed to be some kind of detective or government official from earlier. The ambulance had already left with the couple.

The two of them stopped their conversation as we approached them. The well-dressed man looked over at me and gave me a professional but warm smile. I’ll admit—he was a lot better-looking than most cops I’d seen. He was clean-cut, sharp as a razor, maybe a little older than what I usually go for. He honestly looked like he could have made it as an actor out in Hollywood if he tried.

“Ashley, I presume?” he said with practiced politeness. I nodded as he continued speaking.

“I know you’ve both had a long night so I won’t take up your time.”

He reached into his pocket and handed us two laminated cards.

“Here’s my card—if you want to talk about what happened after some rest, feel free to give me a call.”

I looked down at it and squinted slightly at the neatly printed text: “Detective Reid Callahan, Yellowstone County Sheriff’s Office,” followed by his badge number, phone number, office address, and fax number.

“Sure,” I said, nodding a little as I pocketed the card, feeling the need for sleep gnawing at my brain. Jake glanced over at me, noticing just how worn out I looked.

“Both of you did amazing work finding those two tonight. We’ll handle the rest. You two can take off and have the next few days off.”

We thanked him, and he tossed a pack of Marlboro Reds each. I didn’t smoke.

Felix and I silently shambled back to our trucks. Before he climbed into the driver’s seat, I wordlessly pushed the pack of smokes into his hand while trying to manage a smile, but it probably looked pretty pathetic. I could only stare as the flashing lights filled my vision and I wondered… why, just why did this have to happen to me? Why did this happen to us?",2,1768021611.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

**Landfall**

 

“We just met. He wasn’t too far off from the fire, must’ve rolled down a collapsed hill. I was getting ready to leave too.” Guan said, removing the blood-soaked bandages from the man’s leg, and proceeded to do the same for his body. She opened her satchel and took out a fresh roll. It smelled of lavender, lemon, and cinnamon, and she re-wrapped the one side, and got ready for the other half. Sadia, a woman with dark braids hanging from either side of her, widened her eyes when she began to peel off the burnt clothing around the man’s shoulders. The skin coming off with the shirt forced something up from her stomach and she had to fight it.

Guan rolled up her sleeve, took out a syringe and stuck herself, drawing a vial of blood. She injected the vial into the vein at the crease of his arm. Once emptied, she resumed wrapping the arm and noticed Sadia growing uneasier by the second and could only smile.

“Come here, help me get him onto the bed. Can you pull it out for me?” she asked.

Sadia pushed down the sickness and slid over to the opposite wall of the tiny med bay, pushed several keys and a small cot flipped out. It was dusty and too short for him, but it would have to do. Comfort in an evac ship was never a priority. Guan and she were careful as they moved him to it, and his legs were propped up by a crate. Guan folded his arms across his chest and gave him a light kiss on the head.

“Ok, it’s not my place but aren’t you afraid of contracting infection? I know it’s just us but if you catch something.” Sadia said.

“If we had just let him be, then yes, it would set in. But Emalians are resistant either way, at least that’s what I read in the guidebooks.” She replied.

Sadia pulled down a wall chair and sank into it, removing her fur-lined coat, “You can’t believe those things, it makes us out to seem superhuman and novel. They’re not even written by us.” She turned to the status monitor and checked the autopilot; they would make it to Somatica with the fuel available but barely. Guan applied pressure to her stick spot and rested her head on the wall, taking momentary glances at the man lying to her left. “There must be some truth to it, look at you two.”

Sadia didn’t know whether to laugh or take it in earnest, “Well, if you were able to stick around long enough, you’d see it for yourself.”

“I was there for a few months. Mostly by myself, but some locals were kind enough to help me. There was an old man who helped me fix my knife.”

“Romanosuke. He’s a transplant, but he has done a lot for our community as a whole.” Sadia said, “It’s funny how outsiders can be. You never know who you’ll get.”

Guan chuckled, “You’re welcome.” Sadia looked up and smiled back, showing her dimples, but then it receded as fast as it came. “I need a visual check.”

“I think I’ll stay here to watch over our man.”

Sadia proceeded down the small hallway, passed the bridge and climbed the ladder to the cockpit where Jonas sat. He was fast asleep. There she was in her glowing magnificence. The pale glimmer of Lunascence reflected across the viewer with Sol in the distance, peeking out from the top right corner. She swiveled left, and there was Frongaea, a bastion of destruction.

A once beautiful azure planet swollen and dotted with swirling monsoons, and bright orange plumes. Frothing geysers spewed more debris into the void. She wanted to wake Jonas instead of bungling around at the pilot’s console to see if she could zoom in but he looked comfortable. His black curls and his forest green jumpsuit couldn’t hide that poor excuse for a beard. At least he smelled of ocean spray. The patch on his shoulder read Verdant Group in small gold lettering below a symbol of two trees on a blue sphere with three stars arranged like an inverted triangle. Two silver wings flanked the whole ensemble.

They had managed to outrun the collapse and were now gliding across the canvas of Luna. The initial thruster pods were not enough to reach escape velocity just as the tectonic plates split, but the energy from Jonas’s slingshot maneuver had boosted them much farther than anticipated.

But now the momentum was gone and to conserve fuel, it would take an estimate of four months to reach Somatica. She pulled a blanket from the pilot’s compartment and draped it over him who stirred but didn’t wake. She sat on the small shelf to his right, and it creaked under her weight. A cup of coffee was next to her hand, and it had gone cold but still tasted like hazelnut. Her gloves were stained with dirt and bits of charred clothing had fallen into the coffee. There was no evidence the burned man gave her that he was Emalian, since it could’ve been anyone at this point.

She didn’t feel sorry for the ones left behind, as evil as it sounded in her own head, but they were fools to gather around Shanlaba, waiting to return to their so-called “heaven”. It then occurred to her that she might be the last of her people, drifting along to a new world, but there would be possibilities for a fresh start or at least that’s what VG offered. However, something in her wanted to hold out for any form of kinship. A familiar face. Her mind raced to Toq’toa and that very thought caused her to slam the metallic mug into the grated walkway.

“I ordered a blended coffee, where’s my blended coffee?!” Jonas groaned. His headset had come halfway across his face, but he readjusted and turned to Sadia. He rubbed his eyes and looked down at his feet, now wet, “Oh, hey, uh you all right?”

“Hey, sorry.” She knelt and used a nearby rag, her braids a stark contrast against the cream-colored floor and walls, first wiping his feet then the ground.

He couldn’t stop staring at her form as she mopped the floor, broad at the shoulders and wide at the hips. An hourglass figure if he ever saw one, but he slapped himself with both hands to rid his head of further thought and instead trained on the console.  “Don’t worry about it. How’s our guy doing?”

“According to the Shynes nurse, he’ll be stable.”

“What luck, right?”

“What do you mean?”

“The last two Emalians, like some Adam and Eve. Might as well call this the Cargo of Eden.” He studied the flight data and calibrated the autopilot steering, making sure there were no wasted movements. One of the thrusters was operating at half capacity, and he figured he’d get out and fix it once he got his bearings.

“That’s not funny.” Sadia tossed a braid that had draped over her chest and went back down the ladder, but not before taking the coffee with her.

The ship itself reeked, other than burnt flesh, like the stagnant air of a commercial entity. She dragged the rag across the walls and threw it in an unmarked bin, returning to the med bay. Guan was gone.

He was still how they left him, but he was breathing at a snail’s pace. The blood had stopped leaking so much and there were only a few splotches near his chest, and some scattered around his legs. She got closer and studied his frame. He was tall but not skinny, lean with an athletic build, wide at the chest and back. His thighs and calves were bulky.

She sat opposite him, drinking the coffee one sip at a time.

Guan shuffled in, carrying a glass of buffalo milk and said nothing to either of them, rolling out another fresh set of bandages and got to changing the old ones out. Whatever flesh was left didn’t peel off as easily, and his body started jerking in response to her touch.

“Is he going to be able to swallow?” Sadia asked, but it sounded more hostile than inquisitive.

“His neck muscles are too weak. I’ll have to insert a feeding tube.” She opened her satchel and took out a long tube, a syringe and a clear liquid which she sprayed generously on both items before wiping it clean. The tube was rinsed using the residual sanitizer. She reached behind her back and pulled out the knife and cleaned it as well, new with its white lacquered handle and curved at the tip. Her hand held steady, made a small incision at the abdomen and inserted the tube, no longer pinching at the top but she let go as she poured the milk in from an angle, spilling it.

Sadia headed for the kitchen to grab more milk, and when she returned, Guan had her feed the tube. “Sorry, my tendinitis is acting up.” She took out a handkerchief and wiped up the spill.

“This seems easy enough, until it’s all gone right?”

“Mhmm. The nutrition in the buffalo milk is actually perfect so we’re pretty fortunate.”

“Well, if he is what we think he is, then he’ll make it.” Sadia couldn’t steady herself, and it splashed all over her thigh.

“Go sleep, I’ll manage, I think I have some painkillers somewhere.”  

“You should. Look at you.”

Guan gestured for the tube and kept her hand raised.

There were four pull-out cots in the bunk area just past the med bay, situated at the back near the engine room. Sadia made herself as comfortable as she could and used her coat like a blanket.

 

\~\~\~

 

The tiny kitchen was set up like a restaurant with metal plates and utensils arranged in an orderly fashion. Guan was frying up thin slices of bison in an ungainly amount of butter. Jonas sat at one end of the table and proceeded to chug down a glass of buffalo milk.

“I should’ve visited. This stuff is mind-blowing,” He said, putting down the glass and stared at the sizzling pan. “Commissaries could never with their lab-grown shit.”

Guan served him as Sadia walked in.

“I knew I smelled bison. How did you get that?” she asked.

 “My client was a tourist. He could not shut up about Emalia. The guy sold everything and decided to visit before the world went to shit. Said he would return after buying all this stuff, said he forgot a gift for his kid. I waited a whole week for him.”

“His child is on Somatica?” Guan sat down between them.

“He never said but I would hope so. Otherwise, I just spoiled everyone’s dinner.” 

“It’s already spoiled because we’re eating a dead man’s bounty.”

The bison was overcooked and tough, but Sadia wolfed it down. Jonas had taken his plate to the cockpit along with a fresh cup of coffee. Guan dipped a piece of bread in the leftover meat juices, sopping it all up.

“You don’t waste anything,” Sadia said again. “You’d fit right in.”

“My mom,” Guan took both their plates and washed them in the sink. “Don’t get me wrong, we were well off, but she made sure it didn’t go to our heads.”

“Can I ask you something? You don’t have to ans-”

“Yes.”

“Why Emalia?”

“I needed to get away. As far as possible.”

“Wish I had that luxury.”

Sadia poured herself a glass of buffalo milk and took it to the bunk room, and Guan sat at the dinner table, tapping on her glass of water while humming a melody.

 

\~\~\~

Guan took a detour to Jonas’s cockpit. He was getting ready to head outside, standing at the bridge, checking over his suit at the door of the small air lock. A toolbox was at his feet. “All done?”

His voice through the helmet crackled and fizzled, “This ocean spray scent never gets old.” He handed his mug and plate to her, “Thanks. Thruster’s a bit busted so I’m gonna make a quick fix. I won’t take longer than fifteen but I’ll keep comms open so if ya need, just buzz it.”

She checked the burned man one last time before dropping off the dishes to be washed later, shuffling to the bunk room. The single pathway only accommodated one person at a time, but even her slender frame somehow felt wider than normal. Sadia tossed around several times, her brows mashed against her eyelids.

The cot felt like feathers and clouds, but she was way too tired to fall asleep. She touched her cheeks, and it was starting to dry since she hadn’t showered in two days. But at this point, she didn’t want to get up. The locket necklace that hung around her neck drooped over to her left, and she held it in front of her.

Yang’s smile was bright as she remembered, clutching her mother’s and her shoulder with that wingspan of his, the eyebrows rising to the edge of his hairline. Her mother, Hoa, always wore the same expression. Thin lips, a meager grin but her eyes showed everything. A strength and a quiet resilience. Kitty stood just peeking above Yang’s left arm, her top bun perfect and lined with a row of pearls. Her thick-rimmed glasses were too big for her but that’s how she always liked it.

She listened to the clanking reverberating back inside when Jonas passed by the bunk area. His magnetic boots thudded twice as he secured himself to work, and it reminded her of the window cleaners outside Chanhan Hospital. Hundreds of feet in the sky, secured by a metal carriage no longer than a regular bench and no protection from the elements. That was daring to her.

They worked in the presence of vulnerability, and she could only watch from the other side. If she was a field medic in times of war, would she have so much control over things like she did now? It was unfair to think of herself in this way, her certifications proved it, but it was the very reason she had to leave.

\~\~\~

Jonas’s welding torch lit up his face like a solar flare in the darkness, and his heartbeat was rapid from him chugging one and a half cups of coffee in the span of an hour. Still, his hands were steady as he sealed up a crack in the aft rocket engine booster. He checked his EVA suit, and the vitals were still good. The spare oxygen tank would last six hours, and he had stored ten more in the small cargo space near the engine room. He popped open a panel near the booster and found several burned wires but all he had to do was strip the melted casing, snip off the ends, and rewound them.

He flashed a small light on the console circuit.

“Bingo. Found the real issue.”

Half of the capacitors were fried crispy and came off with a flick of his giant gloved finger. A proper evacuation procedure wouldn’t come close to burning one, but a slingshot maneuver wasn’t in the cards for any ordinary evac pilot. Two years of combat flight training, one year in the field during the Plate Wars and now he was ferrying the last of the survivors. It was funny how things translated so fast in such a short time. VG’s wacko president was only a wacko until he was right. Now he was on Somatica laughing his ass off.

The noiseless vacuum served to drive the question home. Who would take command of The Red Devil? It was much bigger with more territory to cover, no real laws or governing body established so it was basically up for grabs by whoever wanted more. VG wanted to lay claim but if history taught him anything, other than an undefeated way to fall asleep, the first settlers were generally not the ones who stood last. But he felt the planet wasn’t going to let anyone have their way. Maybe his former client and all his babbling had finally resonated, or maybe he just wanted to believe to keep any semblance of that man alive.

\~\~\~

The emergency klaxon blared and shook Sadia from her sleep. She rushed to the bridge and climbed up to the cockpit. What she saw from the moment she looked up to clear the steps other than an empty seat, her body failed to respond to her brain. She landed on her back and her vision got blurry. The ceiling started spinning, it felt like the whole ship was spiraling out of control, and she searched for the rail to pull herself up. Guan appeared from the other end of the hall, “What’s wrong? Are you all right?”

“Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!” She scrambled up the ladder and ran straight up to the front window. She couldn’t fathom it. She thought they had outrun the Frongaean collapse, but now Luna had begun to split. Visible cracks splintered across her as they passed. *The gods have spoken, haven’t they?* She brushed it from her mind and the dense blue geysers thrusted toward Luna on its way to skewer it. 

A rumbling rocked the ship like marbles in a tin can, and she held on to the rail. A gas leak sprung somewhere and there was a metallic groan louder than any horse in heat and there Jonas was, firing his EVA suit’s thrusters in desperation to reach the airlock. It was useless. He drifted closer to the collapsing Luna, and worse, closer to the geysers. He managed to get through to the comms channel, but he was so fixated, he didn’t realize a large piece of Luna behind him, and it smashed him against it driving forward towards the ship. His screams became clearer as he approached, flat against the pale slab. Sadia turned to see where Guan was, and saw her leg bent around the corner of the entrance to the med bay, her vials cracked all over the ground. The burned man’s head was visible, and his eyes were open.

“He’s awake.” Guan said, touching Sadia’s shoulder. She pushed her away in reaction and jumped to her feet, hitting her head on the bunk above her. Guan grabbed her and sat her down in the chair, smoothing over her tangled hair, straightening out her braids. One of them had come loose, and it draped over her clavicle. Guan picked up the red band used to tie it and fixed it for her. Her eyes spoke a different tone.

Sadia’s head pounded something fierce, and whether it was from the nightmare or physical trauma, she didn’t know. They walked together to where the burned man lay. The jaded green eyes were clear as day and his mouth parted underneath the wraps.

“W..wher…” Ashy and barren. Her pace was slow but steady as she approached him, and he kept eye contact the whole way until she reached him. He then turned to the ceiling.

“Where am…”

“What’s your name?” She asked, her voice still shaky but the thickness of her tone belied it.

Guan pulled her away from him and into the hall where Jonas had just entered from the airlock. He saw the way Sadia stood, her shoulder muscles untensed, sagging almost and her breath was ragged. He wanted to say something until Sadia caught his stare for a long second and he turned to the cockpit.

“Take a couple minutes out here,” Guan said, and touched her temples. “Your temperature is rising a bit. I’ll get you some warm milk, do you want that? Or a warm towel?”

“I can get it myself.”

Sadia sat in the same spot and stared into the bag of milk, the screw top crowing over the counter. Four crates of them sat right next to it and sealed in nitrogen. Enough for three months if they took a glass a day.

It didn’t make any sense for him to recover at such a rapid rate. Full body burns. He was practically a corpse, unresponsive, and smelled of death when they loaded him onboard. His neck looked like it was going to rip off at the slightest misdirection. The only thing they needed was a coffin. Toq’toa came to her mind again, and his eyes were open the whole time.

\~\~\~

Guan hovered over the burned man. She had taken off her shawl, using it as a headrest for him. Her rounded chin had more of a shape now, and her neck wore the richness of her previous life.

“Who are… you?” He asked.

“Liang Ying Guan, a human like you,” she smiled. “Please try not to move too much.” She proceeded to change out his wraps, but her hands felt heavy. “Guan is fine.”

His eyes shifted from corner to corner, up and down. He tried to lift his arm, but Guan placed it back down, removing the bandages. Semblances of his skin were starting to return and with it, feeling and sensation. Each time she pulled the wrap tight, he winced, and each wince came with an apology from her. “You’re lucky. Most of your tendons are still intact, but you will be sensitive to certain temperatures.”

“How?”

“What do you mean?”

“What is going… on?”

 “You’re alive. That’s what’s going on.”  

He closed his eyes and exchanged no more. She finished up and disposed of the large pile of dirty bandages in the trash recycler, heading to the cockpit. Jonas had spent the better part of the hour adjusting the main thruster’s output, ensuring a slow and controlled burn. Guan stood next to him, looking to the left viewer as they left Luna in their wake.

“More coffee?” she asked, pointing at his empty cup.

“Nah. It’s doing nothing.”  He tapped several keys and brought up the auxiliary engine status, and it was filled with images Guan didn’t bother to understand. “She all right?”

“She’s just in shock. I think she had a bad dream.”

Jonas sighed, “This is all a bad dream but waking up doesn’t make things better.” His lips moved little as he spoke, and his chest puffed outward and descended slowly. “How are you? I never got your name by the way.”

“Liang Ying Guan.”

“Yeah… I’m not gonna disrespect you or your family by trying to pronounce that. ‘Gigi’ okay with you?”

“I love it,” she realized she was stepping right onto his suit and picked it up, “Jonas Bueller.”

“You read my suit. Sorry, let me get that cleaned up and put away.” He swiveled to get up but Guan stopped him.

“You focus on what you do best.”

“I don’t know, the Cargo of Eden *is* aboard. Feels VIP and all that shit.”

They shared a laugh.

1q8v9ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultChildren/comments/1q8v9ub/alcoholic_father_dying/,Alcoholic Father Dying,"I am almost 30, and my father has been an alcoholic as long as I can remember. It got significantly worse when I was 7 and my youngest brother was born. I moved out as soon as I was 18, and felt guilty for leaving my brothers unprotected. My dad loathed my now husband, who I started dating long distance in high school. I moved to another state for my work and to be closer to him. My dad did everything to break us up. Tried to sue him over a fender bender. Then CANCER joined the party, stage 4 colorectal and liver, and he stopped drinking cold turkey for treatment. Had an epiphany that he had treated the people around him terribly. Apologized to me and my husband in front of everyone at our wedding. We're almost 8 years later, and he's finally terminal. 3 remissions, always back to drinking after getting the all clear. It's hard not to get angry that his choice to drink has lead down a path to death. Multiple times. Even after he was given so many chances at a new lease on life. He's going to die this year, as the cancer has spread aggressively and treatment is no longer working. He's out at my home visiting, and the box of wine I had in the garage is almost empty. I drank maybe 1/4 of it over the last month. He's been sneaking out there, leaving a disposable coffee cup on a high shelf he thought no one would find. I'm just tired of it. I don't know what to do anymore. ",1,1768021464.0,AdultChildren,1,1.0,False

1q8v946,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1q8v946/reese_talks_about_food_issues_therapy_and_a_talk/,"Reese talks about food issues, therapy and a talk she had with a pastor","Reese Quibell is wearing a new $68 plus-sign hat from imogene + willie, a company that makes jeans she loves. ""They're not cheap by any means, but they're all handmade, hand stitched,"" Reese says, adding that she has owned three pairs for years because the company fits and tailors them for her in the store. Many of their jeans cost well over $250 a pair. She bought the hat before Christmas, she says. Jewelry is her favorite thing to buy. 

""I don't care about clothes anymore,"" she says. Reese puts purses in that category too, saying that she would like to get rid of some of her purses. But she has already sold at least 18 of her expensive designer handbags in the past seven months on Poshmark and she has others listed for sale. She likes to look at her hat as a cross, she says.   
  
A fan uses her monthly membership message to tell Reese she's getting her braces off and to celebrate, she's upgrading her membership to join the Relatable Reese Zoom call so she can show off her teeth. ""That's amazing,"" Reese says. She took a gift from Ecuador to Christy at Southern Goods Mercantile today.   
  
She and her mom got lunch from a sandwich shop today. Reese talks about being disgusted by her mom's Reuben sandwich and claims she always gets vegetarian sandwiches, which isn't true. She just ate a turkey sandwich yesterday and she often talks about ordering bacon and egg sandwiches.   
  
Reese says she has the palate of a 5-year-old. It upset Jeff and really bothers Tommy that she won't try anything new, but she's not going to try fish or new meats, she says. Tommy told her it was frustrating that she wouldn't even take a bite of something new. ""I got mad at him. Why is that frustrating for YOU?"" she says.   
  
She hasn't eaten a hot dog since dissecting a pig as a teenager, but she ate chorizo dip at a Mexican restaurant in Ecuador, she says. Tommy told her that chorizo is the same as a hot dog, she says. ""I don't know what to tell you. It's a choice,"" she says, adding that H's diet is very regimented with a lot of protein and he works out three hours a day. ""He won't even touch sugar,"" she says.   
  
Reese describes her Scientologist father slamming his hand on the table and screaming ""Rat shit! Eat it!"" at her when she didn't want to eat the dinner he made and she asked him what the black things were in the food. ""It was probably pepper,"" she says, adding that her dad's reaction made her cry. She was 8 years old.   
  
She claims she's very weird about food and who makes it for her, but she filmed a chef in Ecuador double-dipping in a skillet of risotto and still said it looked killer.   
  
She says she hardly had any coffee in Ecuador because there was no heavy cream and ex-pats there use milk that has been sitting out all day. She only drank coffee at church because the church offered chilled half and half, she says. Tommy tried to tell her that the unrefrigerated milk was just milk. ""Hell no,"" she says, adding that she doesn't drink milk anyway.   
  
""I was raised on the barley formula,"" she says, referring to the barley, cow's milk and Karo syrup concoction that L. Ron Hubbard instructed Scientologists to feed babies. When Reese had H, she chose to break a rule and research barley formula for herself. She then broke another rule by using goat's milk instead of cow's milk. Reese claims she has never tasted milk on its own and when she talks about watching other people eat white foods, she almost gags on camera.

She says she did hear that former Scientology president Heber Jentzsch died. ""I remember him as a child. Rest his soul. That's too bad,"" she says. A few minutes later, she says ""Yeah, I heard Jeffrey Hawkins passed. I don't entirely know who that is."" Reese got his name wrong. She is referring to Jefferson Hawkins, a former Scientology executive who appeared on Scientology and the Aftermath and was responsible for a hugely successful Dianetics campaign.   
  
Jefferson told the world that David Miscavige, the leader of Scientology, lunged across a table and beat him up in front of a roomful of witnesses. Reese says she only knows that he was on Leah's show. She and Jefferson were Facebook friends, she says, and she wishes she could have learned more about him. He wrote books, Reese. You can still learn about him if you want.  
  
Reese agrees with a chatter who says that choosing to just eat the things she liked was the only thing Reese could control as a child. She says she had therapy today and she loves it. She has a couple people in her life who make her feel shame, she says.   
  
Her therapist allegedly told her that when we feel out of control, we place the blame and shame on another person. She claims her therapist told her emphatically that she doesn't do that ""from what I've seen over the years talking with you. You're the opposite. You shut down."" But she hasn't been seeing this therapist nearly that long and she hasn't had many sessions with him, so what Reese is saying is very suspicious.   
  
She saw this therapist for the first time on Jan. 21, 2025 and she has admitted that she spent a number of those sessions talking about her YouTube channel, her relationship with Tommy and what she wants from future dating relationships. She hasn't been doing a lot of deep work with her therapist about her family or Scientology.   
  
She reminds her audience that she has only been out of Scientology for three years and that's not a lot of time to discover who she is.

Reese says her therapist told her that people who want to speak to the manager are placing blame and shame on another person so they can feel like they're in control of something. She says she hates it when a few people in her life come to her after she has made a mistake that only affects her to say ""What made you do that? Why did you make those choices? ... Now H is affected by that. Why did you do that?"" Those people are rubbing it in her face, she says.   
  
Reese tells her audience that if she hurts one of them, of course she wants to know about it so she can fix it and apologize. She says she's so locked into her habits at this point that it feels better just to live with H and not to live with Tommy right now.   
  
Reese says her therapist told her that when somebody makes a huge mistake with her, she's going to abandon the situation. ""There's no way I'm going to address it"" and ask why they didn't make better choices, she says. Reese claims that she holds herself to the highest standard and when she does something stupid, she makes herself suffer for it and will talk out loud and call herself a fucking idiot. She emphasizes again that she doesn't like it when other people point out a stupid mistake she made.   
  
Reese wrongfully claims that her critics are the most mad at her when she makes money from superchats or gifted memberships. That's not true. Most of us get the most upset when she exploits her son's traumas and puts him on camera. She asks why critics care when she gets superchats because that doesn't affect us.   
  
Most of us care because we see her manipulating money out of people and some fans who send her money need it more than she does. Reese wastes a lot of money on stuff she doesn't need and clothes that don't fit her, but she's very good at making her audience worry that she can't afford to keep her house at a comfortable temperature or pay for a new set of tires when the current ones are totally bald.  
  
Reese says Tommy does so much research for his shows that it makes her feel bad when she just comes on camera and asks what her viewers want to talk about. But she's bragging that she does nothing to prepare for her streams and a lot of people still show up to watch her.   
  
She says the idea that she's a master manipulator and a cult leader is the craziest thing she's ever heard. A chatter tells Reese that she's still angry that Shelise from Cults to Consciousness ""was gaslighting you about how you joked about being a cult leader.""   
  
Reese's fans are so upset with Shelise because she has allowed the truths about Reese and Tommy as well as the harm that Reese has done to stay in the comments under Reese's interview. Some of them were so pissed off that they posted some very nasty statements about Shelise and intentionally tried to spread destructive rumors about her and her husband.   
  
Reese tries again tonight to convince her chat that the negative comments about her on Shelise's channel are an OSA op. ""I already forgot about it,"" she says. ""... Those weren't our people. It's not the end of the world.""   
  
She shows a photo she took of the pastor she went back to see in Ecuador. There's also a Bible verse on the screen about scoundrels creating trouble. She shows more Bible verses about gossip from that sermon and says that sermon about guarding your heart was speaking to her. Reese starts talking a little more about Pastor Gary and then quickly tells her chat that she's not making this stream about God ""so don't worry.""   
  
Reese says she asked Pastor Gary how he guards his heart because he knows thousands of people like she does. He tapped the Bible he was holding and told her he reads it all the time, she says. Reese says that strategy is not for everybody and it's not even for her because she's not regularly reading the Bible like she should be.  
  
She talks about the movie Doubt and the scene with the lesson against gossip yet again. Reese says there's somebody who has been on YouTube who is a bit of a bully toward her so she's keeping an eye on them. Reese told somebody today who knows that person that if that person attempts to bully her again this year ""I will burn my fucking channel to the ground. ... I will take me and that person below ground to hell if I have to.""   
  
Reese says that she doesn't know where she would be if she didn't have her channel because her life was really in danger in her last marriage. She claims that she felt like she was at the end after being kicked out of Scientology and losing so many people, but then she found this group of people and they lifted her up every day, gifted her with presents and superchats and sent her emails about their very personal stories.   
  
""I have made thousands of friendships. I have lost friendships,"" she says. She says she has been rescued and swallowed whole by all the gifts and the safety net people on her channel have given her. ""My mods will be with me until the day I die,"" she says. But that's what Reese used to say about other groups of mods who have left her. She claims the people on her channel care more about her than her own family does.   
  
Reese says she told her therapist today that she'll end her streams and she'll find a message from someone she hardly ever talks to. That person will tell her they sent her $20 or $30 through a cash app and they'll say ""You do a lot for me. I just want you to have this.""   
  
She says she wishes there were more than one of her because she's thousands of emails behind. She is really sadfishing and then she pushes it even further, saying ""I wish I had more income to fly and do meet-ups. ... I wish I could be more there for you like you've been there for me."" But when Reese goes to meet-ups, she's the center of attention and her fans buy her all kinds of gifts. 

She says the Zoom calls for high-paying members are so meaningful and touch her heart because she has thousands of fans and there's only one of her. ""I get to see you. I get to talk to you for hours and hours,"" she says. But Reese has apologized several times after Zoom calls for taking up so much of that time with her own problems and stories.  
  
She tells a chatter she intends to go to New York this year. ""Interesting you say that,"" she says. ""... I will be in Florida this year as well. ... I may be in Florida more regularly than not. ... It will be a few hours from Clearwater.""   
  
She claims that she has attached at least one memory to every person in her chat and on her replay crew.   
  
Reese says she's been messaging with a fan whose 12-year-old son has a brain tumor and she wants her channel's charity of the month to be the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""Her son's name is Joshua for anybody that wants to pray,"" she says. She's crying and saying that she would be a puddle on the floor if something like that happened to H.   
  
Reese says she's going to make her donation tomorrow night in Joshua's name and she invites everyone else on her channel to do that. She thanks all of her channel members and tells them that their memberships really keep her and H going.",6,1768021404.0,OT42,3,1.0,False
1q8v8zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/murakami/comments/1q8v8zw/cafe_that_murakami_visited/,Cafe That Murakami visited,"Perhaps it was because of Haruki I started to watch this YouTube channel where the vlogger visits old, small jazz cafes and classical music cafes in Japan.  The vlogger is Japanese.  I find watching these videos extremely calming.  There are no cafes like this in my country but if I visit Japan I think my entire holiday would be spent visiting cafes that play jazz and serve slow drip coffee.  I like how these cafes have nothing new in them.  Old albums.  Old stereos.  Old furniture that has lasted decades.  

In this video the owner of the cafe recalls that Murakami visited a few times and found the cafe as cosy as his home.  Looking at the interior of the cafe it looks just like some ones home.  Perhaps Haruki still visits occasionally?

**Landfall**

“We just met. He wasn’t too far off from the fire, must’ve rolled down a collapsed hill. I was getting ready to leave too.” Guan said, removing the blood-soaked bandages from the man’s leg, and proceeded to do the same for his body. She opened her satchel and took out a fresh roll. It smelled of lavender, lemon, and cinnamon, and she re-wrapped the one side, and got ready for the other half. Sadia, a woman with dark braids hanging from either side of her, widened her eyes when she began to peel off the burnt clothing around the man’s shoulders. The skin coming off with the shirt forced something up from her stomach and she had to fight it.

Guan rolled up her sleeve, took out a syringe and stuck herself, drawing a vial of blood. She injected the vial into the vein at the crease of his arm. Once emptied, she resumed wrapping the arm and noticed Sadia growing uneasier by the second and could only smile.

“Come here, help me get him onto the bed. Can you pull it out for me?” she asked.

Sadia pushed down the sickness and slid over to the opposite wall of the tiny med bay, pushed several keys and a small cot flipped out. It was dusty and too short for him, but it would have to do. Comfort in an evac ship was never a priority. Guan and she were careful as they moved him to it, and his legs were propped up by a crate. Guan folded his arms across his chest and gave him a light kiss on the head.

“Ok, it’s not my place but aren’t you afraid of contracting infection? I know it’s just us but if you catch something.” Sadia said.

“If we had just let him be, then yes, it would set in. But Emalians are resistant either way, at least that’s what I read in the guidebooks.” She replied.

Sadia pulled down a wall chair and sank into it, removing her fur-lined coat, “You can’t believe those things, it makes us out to seem superhuman and novel. They’re not even written by us.” She turned to the status monitor and checked the autopilot; they would make it to Somatica with the fuel available but barely. Guan applied pressure to her stick spot and rested her head on the wall, taking momentary glances at the man lying to her left. “There must be some truth to it, look at you two.”

Sadia didn’t know whether to laugh or take it in earnest, “Well, if you were able to stick around long enough, you’d see it for yourself.”

“I was there for a few months. Mostly by myself, but some locals were kind enough to help me. There was an old man who helped me fix my knife.”

“Romanosuke. He’s a transplant, but he has done a lot for our community as a whole.” Sadia said, “It’s funny how outsiders can be. You never know who you’ll get.”

Guan chuckled, “You’re welcome.” Sadia looked up and smiled back, showing her dimples, but then it receded as fast as it came. “I need a visual check.”

“I think I’ll stay here to watch over our man.”

Sadia proceeded down the small hallway, passed the bridge and climbed the ladder to the cockpit where Jonas sat. He was fast asleep. There she was in her glowing magnificence. The pale glimmer of Lunascence reflected across the viewer with Sol in the distance, peeking out from the top right corner. She swiveled left, and there was Frongaea, a bastion of destruction.

A once beautiful azure planet swollen and dotted with swirling monsoons, and bright orange plumes. Frothing geysers spewed more debris into the void. She wanted to wake Jonas instead of bungling around at the pilot’s console to see if she could zoom in but he looked comfortable. His black curls and his forest green jumpsuit couldn’t hide that poor excuse for a beard. At least he smelled of ocean spray. The patch on his shoulder read Verdant Group in small gold lettering below a symbol of two trees on a blue sphere with three stars arranged like an inverted triangle. Two silver wings flanked the whole ensemble.

They had managed to outrun the collapse and were now gliding across the canvas of Luna. The initial thruster pods were not enough to reach escape velocity just as the tectonic plates split, but the energy from Jonas’s slingshot maneuver had boosted them much farther than anticipated.

But now the momentum was gone and to conserve fuel, it would take an estimate of four months to reach Somatica. She pulled a blanket from the pilot’s compartment and draped it over him who stirred but didn’t wake. She sat on the small shelf to his right, and it creaked under her weight. A cup of coffee was next to her hand, and it had gone cold but still tasted like hazelnut. Her gloves were stained with dirt and bits of charred clothing had fallen into the coffee. There was no evidence the burned man gave her that he was Emalian, since it could’ve been anyone at this point.

She didn’t feel sorry for the ones left behind, as evil as it sounded in her own head, but they were fools to gather around Shanlaba, waiting to return to their so-called “heaven”. It then occurred to her that she might be the last of her people, drifting along to a new world, but there would be possibilities for a fresh start or at least that’s what VG offered. However, something in her wanted to hold out for any form of kinship. A familiar face. Her mind raced to Toq’toa and that very thought caused her to slam the metallic mug into the grated walkway.

“I ordered a blended coffee, where’s my blended coffee?!” Jonas groaned. His headset had come halfway across his face, but he readjusted and turned to Sadia. He rubbed his eyes and looked down at his feet, now wet, “Oh, hey, uh you all right?”

“Hey, sorry.” She knelt and used a nearby rag, her braids a stark contrast against the cream-colored floor and walls, first wiping his feet then the ground.

He couldn’t stop staring at her form as she mopped the floor, broad at the shoulders and wide at the hips. An hourglass figure if he ever saw one, but he slapped himself with both hands to rid his head of further thought and instead trained on the console.  “Don’t worry about it. How’s our guy doing?”

“According to the Shynes nurse, he’ll be stable.”

“What luck, right?”

“What do you mean?”

“The last two Emalians, like some Adam and Eve. Might as well call this the Cargo of Eden.” He studied the flight data and calibrated the autopilot steering, making sure there were no wasted movements. One of the thrusters was operating at half capacity, and he figured he’d get out and fix it once he got his bearings.

“That’s not funny.” Sadia tossed a braid that had draped over her chest and went back down the ladder, but not before taking the coffee with her.

The ship itself reeked, other than burnt flesh, like the stagnant air of a commercial entity. She dragged the rag across the walls and threw it in an unmarked bin, returning to the med bay. Guan was gone.

He was still how they left him, but he was breathing at a snail’s pace. The blood had stopped leaking so much and there were only a few splotches near his chest, and some scattered around his legs. She got closer and studied his frame. He was tall but not skinny, lean with an athletic build, wide at the chest and back. His thighs and calves were bulky.

She sat opposite him, drinking the coffee one sip at a time.

Guan shuffled in, carrying a glass of buffalo milk and said nothing to either of them, rolling out another fresh set of bandages and got to changing the old ones out. Whatever flesh was left didn’t peel off as easily, and his body started jerking in response to her touch.

“Is he going to be able to swallow?” Sadia asked, but it sounded more hostile than inquisitive.

“His neck muscles are too weak. I’ll have to insert a feeding tube.” She opened her satchel and took out a long tube, a syringe and a clear liquid which she sprayed generously on both items before wiping it clean. The tube was rinsed using the residual sanitizer. She reached behind her back and pulled out the knife and cleaned it as well, new with its white lacquered handle and curved at the tip. Her hand held steady, made a small incision at the abdomen and inserted the tube, no longer pinching at the top but she let go as she poured the milk in from an angle, spilling it.

Sadia headed for the kitchen to grab more milk, and when she returned, Guan had her feed the tube. “Sorry, my tendinitis is acting up.” She took out a handkerchief and wiped up the spill.

“This seems easy enough, until it’s all gone right?”

“Mhmm. The nutrition in the buffalo milk is actually perfect so we’re pretty fortunate.”

“Well, if he is what we think he is, then he’ll make it.” Sadia couldn’t steady herself, and it splashed all over her thigh.

“Go sleep, I’ll manage, I think I have some painkillers somewhere.”  

“You should. Look at you.”

Guan gestured for the tube and kept her hand raised.

There were four pull-out cots in the bunk area just past the med bay, situated at the back near the engine room. Sadia made herself as comfortable as she could and used her coat like a blanket.

 

\~\~\~

 

The tiny kitchen was set up like a restaurant with metal plates and utensils arranged in an orderly fashion. Guan was frying up thin slices of bison in an ungainly amount of butter. Jonas sat at one end of the table and proceeded to chug down a glass of buffalo milk.

“I should’ve visited. This stuff is mind-blowing,” He said, putting down the glass and stared at the sizzling pan. “Commissaries could never with their lab-grown shit.”

Guan served him as Sadia walked in.

“I knew I smelled bison. How did you get that?” she asked.

 “My client was a tourist. He could not shut up about Emalia. The guy sold everything and decided to visit before the world went to shit. Said he would return after buying all this stuff, said he forgot a gift for his kid. I waited a whole week for him.”

“His child is on Somatica?” Guan sat down between them.

“He never said but I would hope so. Otherwise, I just spoiled everyone’s dinner.” 

“It’s already spoiled because we’re eating a dead man’s bounty.”

The bison was overcooked and tough, but Sadia wolfed it down. Jonas had taken his plate to the cockpit along with a fresh cup of coffee. Guan dipped a piece of bread in the leftover meat juices, sopping it all up.

“You don’t waste anything,” Sadia said again. “You’d fit right in.”

“My mom,” Guan took both their plates and washed them in the sink. “Don’t get me wrong, we were well off, but she made sure it didn’t go to our heads.”

“Can I ask you something? You don’t have to ans-”

“Yes.”

“Why Emalia?”

“I needed to get away. As far as possible.”

“Wish I had that luxury.”

Sadia poured herself a glass of buffalo milk and took it to the bunk room, and Guan sat at the dinner table, tapping on her glass of water while humming a melody.

 

\~\~\~

Guan took a detour to Jonas’s cockpit. He was getting ready to head outside, standing at the bridge, checking over his suit at the door of the small air lock. A toolbox was at his feet. “All done?”

His voice through the helmet crackled and fizzled, “This ocean spray scent never gets old.” He handed his mug and plate to her, “Thanks. Thruster’s a bit busted so I’m gonna make a quick fix. I won’t take longer than fifteen but I’ll keep comms open so if ya need, just buzz it.”

She checked the burned man one last time before dropping off the dishes to be washed later, shuffling to the bunk room. The single pathway only accommodated one person at a time, but even her slender frame somehow felt wider than normal. Sadia tossed around several times, her brows mashed against her eyelids.

The cot felt like feathers and clouds, but she was way too tired to fall asleep. She touched her cheeks, and it was starting to dry since she hadn’t showered in two days. But at this point, she didn’t want to get up. The locket necklace that hung around her neck drooped over to her left, and she held it in front of her.

Yang’s smile was bright as she remembered, clutching her mother’s and her shoulder with that wingspan of his, the eyebrows rising to the edge of his hairline. Her mother, Hoa, always wore the same expression. Thin lips, a meager grin but her eyes showed everything. A strength and a quiet resilience. Kitty stood just peeking above Yang’s left arm, her top bun perfect and lined with a row of pearls. Her thick-rimmed glasses were too big for her but that’s how she always liked it.

She listened to the clanking reverberating back inside when Jonas passed by the bunk area. His magnetic boots thudded twice as he secured himself to work, and it reminded her of the window cleaners outside Chanhan Hospital. Hundreds of feet in the sky, secured by a metal carriage no longer than a regular bench and no protection from the elements. That was daring to her.

They worked in the presence of vulnerability, and she could only watch from the other side. If she was a field medic in times of war, would she have so much control over things like she did now? It was unfair to think of herself in this way, her certifications proved it, but it was the very reason she had to leave.

\~\~\~

Jonas’s welding torch lit up his face like a solar flare in the darkness, and his heartbeat was rapid from him chugging one and a half cups of coffee in the span of an hour. Still, his hands were steady as he sealed up a crack in the aft rocket engine booster. He checked his EVA suit, and the vitals were still good. The spare oxygen tank would last six hours, and he had stored ten more in the small cargo space near the engine room. He popped open a panel near the booster and found several burned wires but all he had to do was strip the melted casing, snip off the ends, and rewound them.

He flashed a small light on the console circuit.

“Bingo. Found the real issue.”

Half of the capacitors were fried crispy and came off with a flick of his giant gloved finger. A proper evacuation procedure wouldn’t come close to burning one, but a slingshot maneuver wasn’t in the cards for any ordinary evac pilot. Two years of combat flight training, one year in the field during the Plate Wars and now he was ferrying the last of the survivors. It was funny how things translated so fast in such a short time. VG’s wacko president was only a wacko until he was right. Now he was on Somatica laughing his ass off.

The noiseless vacuum served to drive the question home. Who would take command of The Red Devil? It was much bigger with more territory to cover, no real laws or governing body established so it was basically up for grabs by whoever wanted more. VG wanted to lay claim but if history taught him anything, other than an undefeated way to fall asleep, the first settlers were generally not the ones who stood last. But he felt the planet wasn’t going to let anyone have their way. Maybe his former client and all his babbling had finally resonated, or maybe he just wanted to believe to keep any semblance of that man alive.

\~\~\~

The emergency klaxon blared and shook Sadia from her sleep. She rushed to the bridge and climbed up to the cockpit. What she saw from the moment she looked up to clear the steps other than an empty seat, her body failed to respond to her brain. She landed on her back and her vision got blurry. The ceiling started spinning, it felt like the whole ship was spiraling out of control, and she searched for the rail to pull herself up. Guan appeared from the other end of the hall, “What’s wrong? Are you all right?”

“Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!” She scrambled up the ladder and ran straight up to the front window. She couldn’t fathom it. She thought they had outrun the Frongaean collapse, but now Luna had begun to split. Visible cracks splintered across her as they passed. *The gods have spoken, haven’t they?* She brushed it from her mind and the dense blue geysers thrusted toward Luna on its way to skewer it. 

A rumbling rocked the ship like marbles in a tin can, and she held on to the rail. A gas leak sprung somewhere and there was a metallic groan louder than any horse in heat and there Jonas was, firing his EVA suit’s thrusters in desperation to reach the airlock. It was useless. He drifted closer to the collapsing Luna, and worse, closer to the geysers. He managed to get through to the comms channel, but he was so fixated, he didn’t realize a large piece of Luna behind him, and it smashed him against it driving forward towards the ship. His screams became clearer as he approached, flat against the pale slab. Sadia turned to see where Guan was, and saw her leg bent around the corner of the entrance to the med bay, her vials cracked all over the ground. The burned man’s head was visible, and his eyes were open.

“He’s awake.” Guan said, touching Sadia’s shoulder. She pushed her away in reaction and jumped to her feet, hitting her head on the bunk above her. Guan grabbed her and sat her down in the chair, smoothing over her tangled hair, straightening out her braids. One of them had come loose, and it draped over her clavicle. Guan picked up the red band used to tie it and fixed it for her. Her eyes spoke a different tone.

Sadia’s head pounded something fierce, and whether it was from the nightmare or physical trauma, she didn’t know. They walked together to where the burned man lay. The jaded green eyes were clear as day and his mouth parted underneath the wraps.

“W..wher…” Ashy and barren. Her pace was slow but steady as she approached him, and he kept eye contact the whole way until she reached him. He then turned to the ceiling.

“Where am…”

“What’s your name?” She asked, her voice still shaky but the thickness of her tone belied it.

Guan pulled her away from him and into the hall where Jonas had just entered from the airlock. He saw the way Sadia stood, her shoulder muscles untensed, sagging almost and her breath was ragged. He wanted to say something until Sadia caught his stare for a long second and he turned to the cockpit.

“Take a couple minutes out here,” Guan said, and touched her temples. “Your temperature is rising a bit. I’ll get you some warm milk, do you want that? Or a warm towel?”

“I can get it myself.”

Sadia sat in the same spot and stared into the bag of milk, the screw top crowing over the counter. Four crates of them sat right next to it and sealed in nitrogen. Enough for three months if they took a glass a day.

It didn’t make any sense for him to recover at such a rapid rate. Full body burns. He was practically a corpse, unresponsive, and smelled of death when they loaded him onboard. His neck looked like it was going to rip off at the slightest misdirection. The only thing they needed was a coffin. Toq’toa came to her mind again, and his eyes were open the whole time.

\~\~\~

Guan hovered over the burned man. She had taken off her shawl, using it as a headrest for him. Her rounded chin had more of a shape now, and her neck wore the richness of her previous life.

“Who are… you?” He asked.

“Liang Ying Guan, a human like you,” she smiled. “Please try not to move too much.” She proceeded to change out his wraps, but her hands felt heavy. “Guan is fine.”

His eyes shifted from corner to corner, up and down. He tried to lift his arm, but Guan placed it back down, removing the bandages. Semblances of his skin were starting to return and with it, feeling and sensation. Each time she pulled the wrap tight, he winced, and each wince came with an apology from her. “You’re lucky. Most of your tendons are still intact, but you will be sensitive to certain temperatures.”

“How?”

“What do you mean?”

“What is going… on?”

 “You’re alive. That’s what’s going on.”  

He closed his eyes and exchanged no more. She finished up and disposed of the large pile of dirty bandages in the trash recycler, heading to the cockpit. Jonas had spent the better part of the hour adjusting the main thruster’s output, ensuring a slow and controlled burn. Guan stood next to him, looking to the left viewer as they left Luna in their wake.

“More coffee?” she asked, pointing at his empty cup.

“Nah. It’s doing nothing.”  He tapped several keys and brought up the auxiliary engine status, and it was filled with images Guan didn’t bother to understand. “She all right?”

“She’s just in shock. I think she had a bad dream.”

Jonas sighed, “This is all a bad dream but waking up doesn’t make things better.” His lips moved little as he spoke, and his chest puffed outward and descended slowly. “How are you? I never got your name by the way.”

“Liang Ying Guan.”

“Yeah… I’m not gonna disrespect you or your family by trying to pronounce that. ‘Gigi’ okay with you?”

“I love it,” she realized she was stepping right onto his suit and picked it up, “Jonas Bueller.”

“You read my suit. Sorry, let me get that cleaned up and put away.” He swiveled to get up but Guan stopped him.

“You focus on what you do best.”

“I don’t know, the Cargo of Eden *is* aboard. Feels VIP and all that shit.”

They shared a laugh.

1q8v779,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gomorrah/comments/1q8v779/origins_is_off_to_a_good_start_minor_spoilers/,Origins is off to a good start (minor spoilers),"Just finished watching the first 2 episodes and I have to say wow, I'm so happy this spin off exists, I was very worried when I watched the trailers and read D'Amore's interviews but now I feel so much better.

Is it as dark and gritty as the original series? I say yes, there are many more lighthearted scenes than in the OG product, most notably a scene of a botched burglary that almost becomes comedic due to Pietro's and his friends inexperience, but the serious scenes outweigh them, I found that some scenes are even more hardcore than gomorrah, a very tense one in particular in which none of the characters say anything for 3 full minutes and it feels like it goes on forever, or the anticipation of a certain character in prison. But nothing feels out of place, everything perfectly blends in without any ugly bumps.

A movie that came into my mind is once upon a time in america, the series clearly takes inspiration from it with the story of this gang of kids trying to survive and navigate their harsh environment, and they're not even subtle, they go as far as referencing the famous cupcake scene.

Speaking of references the series really loves to reference the og one, foreshadowings, catchphrases you already heard...you name it, nothing felt like cheap fan service to me though, >! There's a scene in which one of the characters has coffee at the house of the widow of one of his friends and the widow blames him for her husband's death, basically a carbon copy of Ciro visiting Attilio's widow at the end of the pilot episode !< , I liked this reference because it shows how this underworld might have changed a lot but certain things remain the same and history eventually repeats itself.
Some other references are much less needed >! Such as Pietro seeing a woman and saying ""with those hair she looks wild like a lioness"" which is a compliment he gave Imma during a prison visit in S1, or Pietro crashing his moped with ""one day"" playing in the background clearly referencing Genny's bike crash from S1, ironically both father and son did it while being shook for witnessing a homicide for the first time, this one in particular will probably piss some of you off since the song is also anacronistic, but it shows how much father and son resemble each other despite Genny constantly saying ""I'm not like my father"" later on !<
All in all they didn't overdo it and I don't mind them since they don't prevent the series from doing its own thing, if anything these scenes made me smirk and reminded me of the good old days.

In conclusion, spin offs, sequels and prequels are often either more of the same and feel stale or they're way too different and alienate the fans of the first hour, origins in my opinion hits the sweet spot, it has its own vibe to spice things up but it's similar enough to not disappoint the long time fans, lets hope it keeps going like this.",3,1768021254.0,Gomorrah,0,1.0,False

1q8v52d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1q8v52d/how_to_build_habits_that_survive_stress_and/,How to build habits that survive stress and laziness: stuff that actually works long-term,"Every January, we all become productivity gods. Gym memberships skyrocket. New planners sell out. But by February, most of it’s gone. This isn’t a lack of motivation. It’s a systems problem. And honestly, most advice online about ""just being disciplined"" is garbage. Especially on TikTok and IG where influencers preach cold showers and 5 AM wake-ups like it's crack.

The truth is, nearly everyone around me, including high-achievers, struggles to stick with habits when life gets even *slightly* chaotic. But stress, fatigue, and laziness don’t have to kill your goals. The way your daily systems are built determines whether your habits survive or collapse. Here’s what actually works, based on research, books, and real psychology.

All tips below come from vetted sources, *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, the *Huberman Lab Podcast*, psychology research from Stanford and Cambridge, plus behavior design experts like BJ Fogg.

* **Make habits stupidly easy in the beginning**
   * *James Clear* calls this the “Two-Minute Rule”: start with a version of your habit that takes under 2 minutes. This rewires your brain to associate the habit with low effort.
      * Instead of “Read 30 pages daily,” go with “Open the book and read one sentence.”
      * Sounds silly, but it builds identity, not just action. Once you do that, most days, you'll do more than 2 minutes anyway.
   * *Stanford professor BJ Fogg*, author of *Tiny Habits*, emphasizes emotion over intensity. Feeling successful daily (even with a tiny version) creates habit momentum. Guilt and failure do the opposite.
* **Never rely on motivation. Design your environment**
   * Motivation is fragile. Systems are antifragile.
      * *Behavioral scientist Katy Milkman* found in her ""temptation bundling"" research (published in *Management Science*) that pairing a habit with a guilty pleasure increases consistency. Example: Only let yourself watch Netflix while on the treadmill.
   * Your environment should make the right choice the easy one.
      * Put your vitamins next to your coffee mug. Lay out your gym clothes the night before. Delete apps that waste time.
* **Use “friction” to make bad habits annoying**
   * Research from Duke University shows we perform 45% of our behaviors out of habit, not decision. So add friction to bad ones.
      * Want to stop mindless scrolling? Log out of Instagram. Move it off your home screen. Add a 5-digit password.
      * Want to save money? Put your debit card in a drawer and use cash envelopes.
* **Habit stacking: Use existing routines as anchors**
   * Your brain craves predictability. *Dr. Andrew Huberman* talks about “context-driven behavior” on his podcast. One way to lock in habits is to build them onto something you already do.
      * After brushing teeth → meditate for 1 minute
      * After making morning coffee → write down 3 things you’re grateful for
* **Track streaks, not perfection**
   * *Brad Stulberg*, in his book *The Practice of Groundedness*, emphasizes consistency over intensity. Habits don’t need you to be “on fire,” just not quitting.
      * Use a habit tracker app or even a paper calendar. When you break a chain, don’t miss two days in a row. That’s it. That’s the game.
      * Missing one day is a blip. Two becomes a pattern. This is backed by research from the *European Journal of Social Psychology,* they found it takes an average of 66 days to solidify a habit, not a strict 21 or 30.
* **Have a “minimum viable fallback” for bad days**
   * Life will get messy. Busy work weeks, illness, breakups, boredom. You need a downgraded version of your habit ready to go.
      * Too sick to workout? Do 5 pushups or just stretch for 2 minutes.
      * Too tired to journal? Just write one sentence.
   * This keeps the **identity loop** intact: ""I'm still someone who works out"" or ""I'm still someone who reflects daily.""
* **Be obsessed with identity, not outcome**
   * Research from *Cambridge University’s Department of Psychology* shows that identity-based habits (“I am a reader” vs “I want to read 20 books”) have a higher long-term success rate.
      * Every time you show up, even for a few minutes, you cast a vote for your new identity.
      * Outcomes are fragile. Identity is sticky.
* **Use “If-Then Planning” before stress hits**
   * This technique, known as “implementation intentions” by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, is powerful under stress and laziness.
      * Example: “If I feel too tired when I get home, *then* I’ll do a 7-minute YouTube yoga instead of the gym.”
      * It’s a pre-loaded script your brain runs when it gets overwhelmed.

Habit-building isn’t about being hyper-disciplined. It’s about being smarter than your future self who’s tired, stressed, and low-energy. Optimize for real-life chaos, not ideal circumstances. Most people fail because their habits are only built for good days.

Don’t wait to feel “ready.” Build fail-proof systems that carry you through the days you aren’t.",1,1768021079.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

 The next morning, we got up early. We ordered breakfast before heading out. Nyla and the innkeeper, Amara, talked for a while, Amara giving us several good locations to purchase supplies from.


We made our way along the shopping district, locating most of the supplies we needed. We were doing some window shopping when, about midday, we started getting hungry. Skia and Sweet shared a look, Sweet informing us that we had some people following us. She guessed ten to twelve people.


I suggested we simply ignore them until something changed, and we went to get some food.


**Confrontation**


As we were rounding a building, two men stepped out in front of us. They were wearing matching leather armor - not particularly high quality, but there was an effort made. Both were holding swords. The larger of the two men demanded we stop.


Nyla, smirking, said, ""Oh look, they're soldiers. What army do you belong to? The army of idiots who think that because we're a small group, we're easy prey?""


As you can imagine, this was not what our two would-be bandits were expecting. It didn't help their pride when we all chuckled.


Attempting to de-escalate, I stepped forward. ""We're not looking for trouble. The real question you need to ask yourself isn't whether or not you can take the five of us with your men. It's how many men are you willing to lose to try to take us. Because I can guarantee you, you will be the first to die.""


Their fearless leader looked both shocked and nervous. It was then that we heard shouting, and the city guard rushed in, overwhelming the would-be bandits.


**New Friends**


The city guard swept in, ignoring us. It was then I recognized one of them from the city gate. He approached me, extending his hand in a traditional greeting. We clasped each other's forearms.


""What's all this? Are you following us?"" I said with a chuckle.


The guard smiled and then explained, ""Not at all. We've been tracking this gang. When we saw them surround you, we decided we should intervene.""


Nyla said, clasping the guard's forearm, ""We're glad you did. Do you need something from us, or are we free to go?""


""I would like to invite you to come down and meet Captain Marcus. We would like to get statements from you as well. Although that's not as important,"" the guardsman said.


**Captain Marcus**


We were led to a large fortified building against the city wall. As we approached, there was a large man, clearly giving orders. If this wasn't Captain Marcus, it would have to be one of his subordinates.


As the guardsman led us closer, he saluted by hitting his chest with his right fist, and announced, ""Captain Marcus. I have our guests, as you requested.""


Captain Marcus returned the salute, then turning to us said, ""I'd like to thank you for coming. I would also like to invite you to dinner.""


Dinner was in the barracks. Captain Marcus is a leader who ate with his men. The food was a hearty mix of stewed vegetables and large chunks of meat. As we seated ourselves at the Captain's table, the rest of his men were carrying on as though nothing was out of the ordinary. You could tell the captain typically took meals with his men; the meal was a social event. The captain did not approach any subject other than to ask how we were.


Once the meal was over, the captain asked us to join him in his meeting room. As we followed the captain, he led us to a large chamber - much bigger than what we needed, although the vaulted ceilings did make it easier for Sweet to move around.


**The Unbranded**


The captain began by saying, ""I want you to know: you are not my enemies. I do know something of who you are."" He then looked directly at me and said, ""You are Paul, the former slave of Tenebris.""


We all tensed. The good captain raised his hands to indicate he was not a threat. He then went around the room, telling us all a little bit about ourselves.


Nyla stood and asked, ""And who, dear captain, are you?""


The captain pulled a chain from around his neck. On the end of that chain was a perfect miniature of *Chain Breaker*.


""I am a member of the Militant Branch of the Church of Peace,"" Captain Marcus explained. ""And this - the Chain Breaker, as Paul named it - is the symbol used by our order.""


We were all shocked, none of us expecting that. Especially since we didn't even know there was a militant arm of the Church of Peace.


Captain Marcus went on. ""The leadership of the Church has decided that simply being protectors of the individual churches is not enough anymore. The rise in corruption and slavery has necessitated that we take a more active role. So, they sent out individuals such as myself to infiltrate key organizations.""


He looked at us with intensity. ""Paul, Nyla, Skia, Sweet, and Medusa. I have need of your help. No, the world has need of your help.""


""For what?"" I asked in confusion.


""We are moving against all of the slavers and corruption, but we need your help. We need someone to lead."" Captain Marcus straightened, his chest puffed out a little as he continued. ""You don't understand. You think you're a band of adventurers. But there's no way that a simple band of adventurers would be comprised of the likes of you. Look at your halberd. Look at your ties to Prydia Solaris. Look at your found family. No, you're not a simple band. You are the leaders of the resistance. You are The Unbranded.""

hey everyone,  
  
i've been doing some research because i'm thinking about starting a small business near one of the big convention centers downtown, and i figured i'd share what i learned about what conference attendees actually want. honestly, it's not all about the business center, a lot of it is convenience and being able to relax.  
  
first off, let's talk about parking because that's always a nightmare. the hotel garages are crazy expensive and often full. a lot of people are driving in and looking for way cheaper options. this is where prked comes in. you can use the app to find someone's unused driveway, garage, or even storage space nearby. it's usually much closer than a random parking lot, feels safer since it's someone's private property, and is quick in/out with no lines. as a parker, you can even ask the host for a quick update or pic if you're worried about your car. it's vip parking for cheaper. if you live near a convention hotel and have extra space like a garage or a driveway, listing it on prked is a super easy way to make passive income. you set your own price and schedule.  
  
as for what else visitors need:  
  
food and drink is huge. people are looking for quick, healthy breakfast/lunch options near the venue (coffee shops, bakeries with sandwiches) and for evening, they want to get out of the hotel. local restaurants that can accommodate a ""dine-around"" (small groups walking to dinner) or bars/lounges are really popular. like over 50 percent of business travelers say they are most excited about the hotel bar. that tells you people want a good place to unwind and network after a long day of sessions. regional foods and local cuisines are a big selling point too.  
  
business services need to be seamless. fast and free wifi is the absolute number one amenity people look for. a 24/7 business center with printing and copying is essential. also, a lot of people forget chargers, so a little specialty shop that sells cheap phone chargers and has a few charging stations would probably clean up.  
  
finally, wellness and convenience. people are trying to stay healthy on the road, so fitness centers are high on the list, and any place that offers a massage or spa service nearby will get traffic. dry cleaning services are also needed since people spill coffee on their suits or need a quick press. and obviously, being close to area attractions is great for when they have free time on the agenda.  
  
hope this helps anyone trying to open up shop near one of these big hotels.",1,1768020633.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I'm young and very athletic and love adventure but was also hoping to get in some beach time if possible. I have some activities already booked for La Fortuna and have read that staying an entire week there would be too much. The drive to Tamarindo seems less stressful and is slightly shorter than the drive to MA, however it sounds like Tamarindo is just sooooo touristy ""Tamagringo"" - I've read so much recently that MA is ALSO touristy and the drive sounds more stressful potentially taking up to 7 hours.

If I went to MA I'd be interested in doing the park, Trail Retro MAE, Nauyaca Waterfalls, maybe take a surf lesson, sloth tour.

If I went to Tamarindo I'd most likely just be at the beach the entire time and take a surf lesson. (haven't done much research on this area yet honestly)

If I stayed in La Fortuna I'd just space out the excursions I'm doing, hit up some other falls / trails off the beaten path, and book more activities. I'm already doing rafting, tabacon, chocolate/coffee tour, arenal 1968

1q8uzds,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverMadeEasy/comments/1q8uzds/safetywing_pricing_breakdown/,SafetyWing Pricing Breakdown,"For less than the cost of three fancy coffees per week, you can avoid a potential $50,000 medical bill abroad. When you break down SafetyWing's pricing like that, the math gets pretty simple.

But here's what most travelers don't realize: SafetyWing's pricing structure is more nuanced than just ""cheap travel insurance."" The cost varies dramatically based on your age, which plan you choose, and what add-ons you need. I've spent hours digging through their pricing to figure out the real cost—and where you can save money.

Let's break down exactly what you'll pay.

# SafetyWing Essential Plan Pricing

The Essential plan is SafetyWing's travel medical insurance—designed for emergency coverage while you're bouncing around the world. This is the one most digital nomads and long-term travelers use (including me).

# Base Pricing by Age

Here's what you'll actually pay for the Essential plan:

|Age Range|Cost per 4 Weeks|Cost per Day|Annual Cost (13 periods)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10-39|$56.28|\~$2.01|\~$731.64|
|40-49|$92.40|\~$3.30|\~$1,201.20|
|50-59|$145.04|\~$5.18|\~$1,885.52|
|60-69|$196.84|\~$7.03|\~$2,558.92|

**Children under 10:** FREE (one per adult, maximum two per family)

💡 **Pro Tip:** That jump from ages 39 to 40 is brutal—you're suddenly paying 64% more. If you're turning 40 soon, lock in your policy before your birthday. The pricing is based on your age when you sign up, not when you travel.

The pricing renews automatically every 28 days (not monthly—SafetyWing operates on 4-week cycles). You can cancel anytime and get a prorated refund for unused days.

# Essential Plan Add-Ons

The base Essential plan is pretty stripped down. Here's what extra coverage costs:

|Add-On|Cost per 4 Weeks|What's Covered|Worth It?|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Adventure Sports**|$10|30+ activities including scuba diving, paragliding, quad biking, skiing|✅ Yes, if you plan any adventure activities|
|**Electronics Theft**|$20|Up to $2,000 per item, $5,000 annual limit|✅ Yes for digital nomads with expensive gear|
|**US Coverage**|$38-48+ (age dependent)|Medical coverage while in the US (30 days max per trip)|⚠️ Only if spending significant time in US|

⚠️ **Important:** US residents can't purchase the Adventure Sports add-on. If you're American and planning to go paragliding in Switzerland, you're out of luck—you'll need different coverage.

The Electronics Theft add-on is only available for policies lasting at least 28 days. You'll need proof of ownership (receipts) to file claims, and they'll reimburse based on current depreciated value, not replacement cost.

# What's NOT Included in Essential

Before you get excited about that $56 base price, here's what you're not getting:

* **No pre-existing conditions** (Essential plan doesn't cover them at all)
* **No routine healthcare** (annual checkups, preventive care)
* **No dental or vision care** (unless it's an emergency)
* **No trip cancellation** (only trip interruption)
* **No maternity coverage**
* **No cancer treatment**
* **Limited home country coverage** (30 days per 90 abroad; only 15 days for US residents)

The Essential plan is purely emergency medical coverage. That's it.

# SafetyWing Complete Plan Pricing

The Complete plan is SafetyWing's comprehensive international health insurance—launched to compete with traditional global health plans. It includes routine care, mental health coverage, and ongoing treatment.

# Base Pricing by Age

Complete plan pricing is significantly higher because you're getting actual health insurance, not just emergency coverage:

|Age Range|Cost per 4 Weeks|Annual Cost (13 periods)|Annual Cost (paid upfront with 10% discount)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Under 18|Not specified\*|Varies|Varies|
|18-39|$161.50|\~$2,099.50|\~$1,889.55|
|40-49|Higher\*|Varies|Varies|
|50-59|Higher\*|Varies|Varies|
|60-64|Higher\*|Varies|Varies|

\*Exact pricing for older age brackets varies—use SafetyWing's calculator for your specific age.

🏥 **Coverage Note:** You can enroll up to age 64. After that, you can't get a new Complete plan—but if you enrolled before 64, you can renew indefinitely.

# Complete Plan Add-Ons

Complete already includes adventure sports coverage as standard (a huge plus). Here's what you can add:

|Add-On|Cost|Coverage Details|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Dental**|Varies by age|Up to $1,000/year ($250 limit first 6 months, then $750)|
|**Electronics Theft**|$20 per 4 weeks|Same as Essential: $2,000 per item, $5,000/year|
|**Hong Kong/Singapore/USA**|Varies|Extended coverage beyond 30 days (required for residents)|

The dental add-on is age-dependent, meaning older travelers pay more. SafetyWing doesn't publish exact pricing—you'll need to get a quote through their calculator.

# Complete Plan Restrictions

The Complete plan has a 12-month commitment. You can request cancellation within the first 15 days, but if you cancel mid-contract, you'll only get up to 65% of unused coverage refunded (unless you have a qualifying life event like marriage or job change with new insurance).

📌 **Key Takeaway:** The Complete plan is NOT available if your country of residence is: Belarus, Canada, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ireland, Palau, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, UAE, or USA. Your ""country of residence"" is where you spend 183+ days per year.

# Essential vs Complete: Which Plan Costs Less?

Here's the real comparison for a typical 18-39 year old traveler:

|Feature|Essential|Complete|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Base Cost (4 weeks)**|$56.28|$161.50|\+$105.22|
|**Annual Cost**|\~$731.64|\~$2,099.50|\+$1,367.86|
|**With 10% Annual Discount**|—|\~$1,889.55|—|
|**Adventure Sports**|\+$10 (extra)|✅ Included|—|
|**Routine Healthcare**|❌ None|✅ Included|—|
|**Mental Health**|❌ None|✅ Included|—|
|**Dental Care**|❌ Emergency only|Optional add-on|—|
|**Pre-existing Conditions**|❌ Not covered|❌ Not covered|—|
|**Commitment**|None (cancel anytime)|12 months|—|

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Complete costs roughly **3x more** than Essential for the 18-39 age group. You're paying that premium for routine healthcare access, not just emergency coverage.

# Real Cost Examples: What You'll Actually Pay

Let me break this down with real scenarios I've analyzed:

# Scenario 1: Budget Backpacker (Age 28)

* **Essential plan only:** $56.28/month = $675.36/year
* **Add electronics theft:** \+$20 = $76.28/month
* **Total:** \~$915.36/year for emergency coverage + laptop/phone protection

This is what I recommend for most budget travelers. You're covered for emergencies, your gear is protected, and you're spending less than $80/month.

# Scenario 2: Adventure Seeker (Age 32)

* **Essential plan:** $56.28
* **Adventure sports add-on:** \+$10
* **Electronics theft:** \+$20
* **Total:** $86.28/month = \~$1,121.64/year

Still incredibly affordable for someone planning to scuba dive, paraglide, or go skiing regularly.

# Scenario 3: Long-Term Nomad Wanting Healthcare (Age 35)

* **Complete plan:** $161.50/month
* **Electronics theft:** \+$20
* **Annual payment (10% discount):** \~$2,099.55/year
* **With discount:** \~$1,889.55/year

For someone replacing their home country health insurance entirely, this is solid value. You're getting routine checkups, mental health support, and global coverage for under $160/month.

# Scenario 4: Over-40 Traveler (Age 45)

* **Essential plan:** $92.40/month
* **With add-ons:** \~$122.40/month = \~$1,591.20/year

The pricing gets less competitive once you hit 40. At this age, I'd compare SafetyWing against Heymondo or IMG Global to see which offers better value.

# Scenario 5: Over-60 Traveler (Age 65)

* **Essential plan:** $196.84/month = \~$2,558.92/year
* **Complete plan:** Not eligible (max enrollment age is 64)

At this price point, you might find better deals with traditional travel insurance companies, especially for shorter trips.

# How SafetyWing Pricing Compares to Competitors

I've compared dozens of travel insurance plans. Here's where SafetyWing sits:

**For ages 18-39:**

* SafetyWing Essential ($56.28/4 weeks) beats nearly everyone
* World Nomads ($80-120/month) costs significantly more
* Allianz and traditional insurers charge $100-200/month

**For ages 40+:**

* SafetyWing loses its pricing advantage
* Heymondo often offers better value for over-50s
* Traditional annual plans become competitive

**For comprehensive health insurance:**

* Genki Native competes with Complete plan pricing
* IMG Global Medical offers similar coverage at comparable rates
* Traditional expat health insurance costs 2-3x more

The reality? SafetyWing's sweet spot is **travelers under 40 who need long-term emergency coverage**. That's where the pricing genuinely can't be beat.

# Hidden Costs & Fees to Watch For

SafetyWing's pricing is refreshingly transparent, but there are a few gotchas:

# US Coverage Gets Expensive Fast

That $38-48 US coverage add-on applies to EVERY 28-day period. If you're spending six months in the US, you're paying an extra $228-288 on top of your base premium.

For US-based travel, traditional insurance might actually be cheaper.

# Age Bracket Jumps Are Brutal

The pricing jumps at ages 40, 50, and 60 are steep. If you're close to hitting one of these thresholds, lock in your current rate before your birthday.

SafetyWing prices based on your age at signup, so if you enroll at 39, you keep that rate until you cancel or hit the next bracket.

# Electronics Coverage Has Limits

That $20/month electronics theft add-on sounds great until you read the fine print:

* Only covers **theft**, not damage or loss
* Reimbursement based on **depreciated value**, not replacement cost
* Must report to police within 24 hours
* Need proof of ownership for all items

If you have a $3,000 camera setup, you might only get $1,500-2,000 back depending on age and depreciation.

# Complete Plan Cancellation Penalty

Remember that 12-month commitment? If you cancel mid-contract, you're only getting back 65% of unused coverage. That's a 35% penalty just for changing your mind.

Do the math before committing to Complete.

# Ways to Save Money on SafetyWing

I've found a few strategies that actually work:

**1. Pay annually for Complete (10% discount)** If you're committed to the Complete plan anyway, paying upfront saves you roughly $210 per year for the 18-39 age bracket.

**2. Skip add-ons you don't need** Honestly evaluate whether you need adventure sports or US coverage. Most travelers can skip both.

**3. Enroll before hitting age brackets** Seriously—if you're 39, 49, or 59, lock in your rate before your birthday.

**4. Use the free children's coverage** If you're traveling with kids under 10, you get ONE free child per adult (max two per family). That's potentially $731/year in savings.

**5. Cancel during low-risk periods** Planning to stay put for two months in a country with cheap healthcare? Cancel SafetyWing temporarily and save money. You can always restart coverage later.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** If you're doing short trips (under 3 months), compare SafetyWing's Essential plan against single-trip insurance from Allianz or Travelex. Sometimes traditional insurance is cheaper for brief, defined trips.

# Is SafetyWing's Pricing Actually Worth It?

After analyzing the pricing from every angle, here's my honest take:

**Essential Plan is worth it if:** ✅ You're under 40 and traveling long-term ✅ You need flexible, month-to-month coverage ✅ You're healthy with no pre-existing conditions ✅ You want bare-bones emergency coverage only

**Essential Plan isn't worth it if:** ❌ You're over 50 (compare against Heymondo) ❌ You need routine healthcare access ❌ You have pre-existing conditions needing coverage ❌ You're taking a short 2-3 week vacation (get trip insurance instead)

**Complete Plan is worth it if:** ✅ You're replacing your home country health insurance ✅ You need routine care, mental health support, dental ✅ You're committed to 12+ months abroad ✅ You want one plan for everything

**Complete Plan isn't worth it if:** ❌ You only need emergency coverage ❌ You can't commit to 12 months ❌ Your country of residence is on the exclusion list ❌ You need pre-existing condition coverage (it's still excluded)

The pricing is genuinely competitive for what you're getting—as long as you're in the right demographic and need the specific type of coverage SafetyWing provides.

# Final Verdict: What Should You Actually Pay?

If you're a typical digital nomad or long-term traveler in your 20s or 30s, here's what I recommend:

**Basic coverage (most people):** $56.28/month for Essential plan **With laptop protection:** $76.28/month (Essential + Electronics) **Adventure travelers:** $86.28/month (Essential + Both add-ons) **Full health coverage:** $161.50/month for Complete plan

For that base $56.28, you're getting $250,000 in emergency medical coverage, $100,000 in evacuation coverage, and global protection across 180+ countries. Can you find cheaper? Maybe. But you won't find more flexible coverage that lets you buy while already abroad and cancel anytime.

The question isn't whether SafetyWing's pricing is cheap—it's whether it covers what you actually need. For emergency medical coverage on long-term travels, the answer is yes.

For comprehensive health insurance, you'll pay more, but you're getting significantly more coverage in return.",1,1768020594.0,CoverMadeEasy,0,1.0,False

If I stayed in La Fortuna I'd just space out the excursions I'm doing, hit up some other falls / trails off the beaten path, and book more activities. I'm already doing rafting, tabacon, chocolate/coffee tour, arenal 1968

1q8uy0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/transbr/comments/1q8uy0f/um_novo_capítulo_na_minha_vida/,Um Novo Capítulo na Minha Vida,"Tenho 28 anos e nasci em Belo Horizonte, mas moro em São Paulo desde os 22. Sou uma pessoa que adora a vida em movimento, sabe? Gosto de acordar cedo, tomar meu café com calma olhando pela janela do meu apartamentinho no Tatuapé, e depois sair correndo pro trabalho como toda paulistana que se preza. Tenho o cabelo castanho escuro, meio ondulado, que vive me dando trabalho porque nunca fica do jeito que eu quero. Meus olhos são dessa cor indefinida entre o verde e o castanho que minha mãe chama de ""cor de mel"". Sou baixinha, um metro e sessenta no máximo, e tenho aquele jeito meio desastrado de quem vive tropeçando nas coisas.

Meus amigos dizem que sou a pessoa mais engraçada do grupo, mas acho que é porque eu rio de mim mesma o tempo todo. Tenho uma turma que conheço desde a faculdade de Arquitetura: a Camila, o Bruno, a Fernanda e o Thiago. A gente se encontra todo final de semana, nem que seja pra tomar uma cerveja num boteco qualquer e jogar conversa fora. São essas pessoas que me conhecem de verdade, que sabem quando estou triste só pelo tom da minha voz no áudio do WhatsApp. A Camila é praticamente minha irmã de outra mãe, a gente divide até conta de streaming porque, né, a vida tá cara demais.

Minha família é pequena mas muito unida. Meu pai, é aposentado e passa o dia cuidando das plantas no quintal da casa em BH. Ele tem essa mania de me mandar foto de cada flor que nasce, como se eu não tivesse visto as mesmas roseiras a vida inteira. Minha mãe, é professora de português aposentada e até hoje corrige meus textos quando mando alguma coisa pra ela ler. Tenho um irmão mais novo,  que tem 24 anos e ainda está terminando a faculdade de Engenharia. Ele é aquele típico irmão caçula que acha que sabe tudo, mas no fundo ainda me liga pedindo conselho sobre a vida.

Trabalho em um escritório de arquitetura no centro. Entrei como estagiária e hoje sou arquiteta júnior, responsável por projetos residenciais de médio porte. O melhor de tudo é que meu trabalho fica a apenas três estações de metrô do meu apartamento. Isso em São Paulo é praticamente um milagre! Levo vinte e cinco minutos de porta a porta, o que significa que consigo almoçar em casa quando quero, não gasto fortunas com transporte e ainda chego descansada pro trabalho. Meus colegas que moram na Zona Sul ficam com inveja quando conto que acordo às sete e ainda tenho tempo de fazer um café da manhã decente. Essa proximidade mudou minha qualidade de vida completamente. Antes eu morava mais longe e passava quase três horas por dia no trânsito. Agora tenho tempo pra academia, pra cozinhar, pra ver minhas séries. É outra vida.

Mas o motivo de eu estar escrevendo tudo isso é outro. É que há duas semanas fui ao Rio de Janeiro pra um congresso de arquitetura sustentável. Eu não queria ir, achava que ia ser chato, mais um evento corporativo daqueles. Mas a empresa pagou tudo e, bom, é o Rio, né? Aproveitei pra esticar o final de semana.

Foi no segundo dia do evento, durante o coffee break, que eu conheci ela.

Ela é arquiteta também, trabalha em um escritório de Niterói especializado em restauração de prédios históricos. Mas antes de saber qualquer coisa sobre a profissão dela, antes de saber o nome dela, eu já tinha reparado nela do outro lado do salão.

Ela tem esse tipo de beleza que te faz perder o fio da conversa. Ela é alta, deve ter um metro e setenta e poucos, com uma postura elegante de quem fez balé quando criança. O cabelo dela é preto, muito preto, liso e comprido, batendo na cintura. Naquele dia estava preso num coque meio bagunçado, com algumas mechas escapando e emoldurando o rosto. E que rosto. A pele dela é morena, desse tom dourado que parece que o sol do Rio mora nela. Os olhos são castanhos escuros, amendoados, com cílios longos naturalmente. Quando ela ri, e ela ri muito, aparecem umas covinhas nas bochechas que são a coisa mais encantadora que eu já vi.

Ela tava usando um vestido verde musgo, simples, que destacava a cor da pele dela de um jeito que parecia proposital mas provavelmente não era. Usava uns brincos de argola dourados e um relógio masculino no pulso que de alguma forma ficava delicado nela. As mãos dela são bonitas também, dedos longos, unhas curtas e bem feitas. Reparei nisso quando ela gesticulava explicando alguma coisa pra uma colega.

Eu fiquei uns bons cinco minutos só olhando, fingindo que estava interessada no meu café aguado, até que ela olhou na minha direção e sorriu. Um sorriso aberto, sincero, como se a gente já se conhecesse. Meu coração disparou de um jeito que não disparava há anos.

A gente acabou conversando por horas naquele dia. Descobri que ela tem 30 anos, é de Petrópolis originalmente, ama gatos e tem dois chamados Niemeyer e Lina. Ela fala sobre arquitetura com uma paixão que é contagiante, os olhos brilham, as mãos não param. Me contou sobre um projeto de restauração de um casarão do século XIX que está fazendo e eu poderia ter ouvido ela falar sobre aquilo a noite inteira.

A voz dela é grave pra uma mulher, meio rouca, e ela tem esse sotaque carioca suave que faz tudo soar como música. Ela também tem essa mania de tocar no braço da pessoa quando está conversando, e cada vez que ela fazia isso comigo eu sentia minha pele formigar.

A gente trocou telefone e desde então conversa todo dia. Toda manhã ela me manda um ""bom dia"" com alguma foto do que está vendo: o mar de Niterói da janela do escritório, os gatos dormindo, o café que está tomando. E toda noite a gente fica horas conversando sobre tudo e sobre nada.

Eu nunca tinha me sentido assim por uma mulher antes. Quer dizer, talvez tivesse, mas nunca tinha admitido pra mim mesma. E agora aqui estou eu, uma arquiteta de 28 anos, completamente perdida por uma carioca de sorriso fácil e olhos de jabuticaba que mora a 400 quilômetros de distância.

Acho que estou me apaixonando. Não, deixa eu ser honesta: eu sei que estou me apaixonando. E pela primeira vez na vida, ao invés de ter medo, estou animada pra ver onde isso vai dar. Agora estou pensando em transicionar para o Rio de Janeiro ano que vem, que acham? ",1,1768020474.0,transbr,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some ideas and strategies for anyone with a business property in a spot that totally booms in summer or winter but is dead the rest of the year. dealing with seasonal cash flow is tough but there are a few smart ways to make that property work for you all year.  
  
first, if you have any extra space at all—a driveway, a garage, or even a back lot—you should list it on prked right now. seriously. a tourist area means people are always circling for parking during peak season, which is crazy profitable. you can set your own prices and schedule, and it's totally passive income. when your souvenir shop or beach rental place is closed from october to may, that empty lot can still be making you money every day. it only takes a few minutes to list the spot and you control when it's available.  
  
for the property itself, try to diversify what you offer. if you run a summer beach rental, use the space for something completely different in the off-season. think about pop-up businesses, like renting the space to a local crafter for a holiday market in december, or hosting a local cooking class or workshop once a week in the slow spring. a themed experience like a ghost tour in the fall is also a way to use the location's proximity to the tourist spot when the main attraction is slow.  
  
also, change your prices dynamically. everyone knows peak season means peak prices, but for the shoulder seasons (the few weeks right before and after the main rush), offer promotional packages or discounts to attract budget-conscious travelers. target locals with special deals and events—they are your year-round base when the tourists are gone. use social media to advertise how much quieter and more peaceful the area is in the off-season, appealing to a different type of visitor.  
  
lastly, try to offer services that don't depend on the weather. a mobile food stall is super seasonal, but an indoor coffee shop or a small museum with local history can draw people when the outdoor stuff is closed. even if you don't want to run a whole other business, renting your unused storage space out is another way to make a little passive cash from your property.  
  
hope this helps someone with their yearly revenue planning.",1,1768020452.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q8ux1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8ux1s/franchise_owner_excess_property_beyond_brand/,franchise owner excess property beyond brand requirements,"i figured i'd share this because being a franchise owner means you sometimes have way more property than the brand actually uses, and that excess space is just money sitting there. it's worth turning that dead space into passive income, especially with commercial real estate costs.  
  
the biggest and easiest is usually the outdoor space you aren't fully using. maybe you have a huge parking lot that is mostly empty after 6pm or on weekends. you can list that extra parking, a spare driveway, or a private garage on an app like prked. it's super easy to list your extra space and set your own price and schedule. people are always looking for cheaper, safer parking nearby, and it gives you a steady, passive income stream without much work. you can rent spots to commuters, nearby residents, or people going to a local event.  
  
for actual unused land on your property, you have a few bigger options. if it's a small patch of dirt near the street, major brands like coffee shops or quick-service restaurants are always looking for high-visibility spots for ground leases, which is basically long-term income without you having to build anything. another option for that extra land is to partner with an ev charging company and lease the space for a few charging stations.  
  
inside the building, look at things like unused basement or back storage rooms. you can totally rent that out for self-storage to local businesses or even individuals. there are platforms for that too. or, if you have a lot of excess interior square footage, you can repurpose it into meeting rooms or a co-working space that you rent out by the hour or day, which is huge right now. a less common but really cool idea is renting out your kitchen after hours to a local food entrepreneur or for cooking classes.  
  
and then there’s the big picture move: the sale-leaseback. if you actually own the property your franchise is on, you can sell the real estate to an investor and then immediately sign a long-term lease to keep operating your business there. this unlocks a ton of capital you can use to expand or pay down debt, but you still keep your location. if you do this, you can also use a 1031 exchange to defer capital gains taxes by reinvesting in other commercial property.  
  
just remember to check your franchise agreement and your lease terms first to make sure you're allowed to sublease or run other businesses on the property.

I was medicated, went to therapy for 1 yr and stopped. Gained weight and had pre diabetes. I was convinced that the medication helped but also didn’t at the same time and contributed to my weight gain and high blood sugar so i stopped the medication around fall 2024. 

I took my pre diabetes diagnosis very seriously and went low carb, gym routine for about 4 months. Then i took a trip to china for 1 month. When i came back, i resumed my low carb diet and gave up after my blood sugar was fixed. I wouldn’t say that i woke up one day not depressed anymore but day after day i noticed that heavy feeling lighter and those thoughts rarely there. 

around fall is when i noticed i am hyper or alert all the time (before i use to be fatigued so much that coffee didnt help me feel energetic). When i had anything caffeinated, i feel like i will explode with all the energy in me so i decide to cut back on caffeine. Lights appear brighter and colors more saturated. I feel like my mood is too good. Almost impossibly positive and im happy almost all the time. Maybe once a month i will get those dark thoughts but it doesn’t bother me at all. I dont have any risky or impulsive behaviors. I am controlling my spending better than ever. I am more yappy maybe because my mood is better. i feel numb sometimes, which is confusing since i feel extreme happiness. 

Is it my frontal lobe forming after turning 25? Can anyone relate to this? I’m afraid that this is a phase and i will be caught so off gaurd.

hey everyone, i figured i'd share some thoughts on maximizing a business location if you're lucky enough to be near a stadium, concert venue, or major nightlife area. it’s a gold mine if you play it right, but it can be a huge headache if you don't nail the logistics.  
  
first thing to figure out is the parking chaos. if your spot has an unused driveway, a small lot, or even a garage, you're sitting on passive income. seriously. list that extra space on prked. it's an app where you can rent out your private spots to people going to the events. it's an easy setup, you set your own price and schedule, and you can flip it on and off whenever you want. for the customers, it means they skip the long lines and the crazy prices of the big commercial lots, and they get closer, reserved parking. they feel safer on someone's property, especially if you have an outside camera, and they get quick in and out. it's a huge value-add for your business location, even if your business isn't directly related to parking. you're just making money off the location itself.  
  
for the actual business, you need to cater to the crowd and the hours. you have high foot traffic, so visibility is key. look at the local demographics. is it mostly families during the day or young adults at night? tailor your offerings to that.  
  
think about quick-turnaround or experience-based businesses. grab-and-go food and beverage spots do really well right before and after an event. a lot of people are looking for fast, quality options instead of long, sit-down dinners. things like gourmet hot dogs, a high-end coffee shop that turns into a quick bar at 5pm, or a specialized dessert spot.  
  
experience-based places are also huge profit centers because people are already in ""fun mode."" think escape rooms, small interactive art galleries, or even a fancy axe-throwing range. you're capitalizing on the idea of a night out, not just a retail trip. you can also use any empty or underutilized space you have for pop-up events or temporary art installations. this brings in new customers and gives you a dynamic feel.  
  
check the flow of traffic too. if people walk one specific route from the venue to the main road or public transport, you want to be on that path. also make sure you analyze your competition nearby to find a niche you can fill. don't open another pizza place if there are three already. maybe you open a late-night dessert bar instead.  
  
hope this helps you turn that high rent into high profit.",1,1768020254.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1q8uv04,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8uv04/business_near_airport_hotels_what_else_works_here/,business near airport hotels what else works here,"figuring out what businesses work near airport hotels is tough because the hotels already have a lot of stuff. i figured i'd share a quick guide based on what i've seen pop up and actually stick around.  
  
the obvious things are food and essentials, but think about the gap when people are staying at an airport hotel versus actually traveling. they need services before they fly or right after they land. this is where niche services really shine.  
  
first, for people driving and parking, you see a ton of long-term lots, but they're always expensive and usually packed. a smart idea i've seen is using an app like prked where people with extra driveways or garages nearby rent them out to travelers. you skip the airport chaos, it's way cheaper for the parker, and hosts make passive income from space they aren't using anyway. for parkers, it feels safer since the car is on someone's property, and sometimes the hosts will even drive you to the terminal like a vip service. if you have an unused garage, definitely list it on prked.  
  
beyond that, think of convenience and time-savers for the traveler.  
  
concierge and assistance services work well. there are companies that do meet and greet services, helping people with bags or navigating to their rental car or even their hotel shuttle. this is huge for families, elderly travelers, or people on a tight layover.  
  
laundry and dry-cleaning pickup and delivery is a winner, especially near hotels with a lot of business travelers. they can drop off their suits when they check in and have them clean and pressed by the time they check out.  
  
specialty retail is another big one. not just souvenir shops, but places that sell that one thing everyone forgets. phone chargers, international adaptors, travel-sized toiletries, small electronics, or even nice luggage repair. a small store with high-quality, forgotten essentials is better than a huge generic gift shop.  
  
for food, go beyond the hotel restaurant. an upscale coffee shop or a unique local-flavor restaurant that the hotel shuttle can easily drop people off at does great. people want to eat well before a long flight but don't want to go too far from the hotel/airport bubble.  
  
hope this helps anyone who is brainstorming for that area.",1,1768020220.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q8uu7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8uu7c/business_near_downtown_convention_district/,business near downtown convention district opportunities,"hey, so you're looking at setting up a business near a downtown convention district, that's a smart move because those areas are becoming huge multi-use hubs for both visitors and locals. figured i'd share some ideas i found on what really works in those high-traffic, professional-but-casual areas.  
  
first thing to keep in mind, parking is a mess in any downtown area, especially when a big trade show is on. if you have any extra space like a garage, an unused driveway, or even a small lot, you can list it on an app like prked to make some easy passive income. convention visitors and exhibitors are always looking for cheaper, closer, and faster vip parking options to skip the official lot chaos, and prked helps them find someone's personal, safer property to park on. if you're a parker, it's way cheaper and often closer than the convention center's official rate. but anyway, back to the actual business ideas.  
  
the most successful areas are walkable and integrate hotels, dining, and entertainment. you want to fill a need that the big hotels and the convention center itself don't cover well.  
  
for quick needs and services:  
  
\* \*\*the forgotten essentials station:\*\* think super high-quality vending or a small kiosk for all the things people forget. this means charging banks for phones, comfortable insoles for tired feet (convention centers are huge), breath mints, travel-sized toiletries, and healthy, non-sugary snacks like nuts, granola bars, and fruit. attendees are always looking for a quick energy boost.  
\* \*\*pop-up branding and print services:\*\* exhibitors constantly need last-minute prints, lamination, banner adjustments, or extra business cards. a small, fast-turnaround print shop with a digital drop-off system would be gold.  
\* \*\*portable relaxation/wellness:\*\* an on-demand massage chair station or a small, quiet space for guided meditation or corporate wellness (some places even use vr or soundscapes for this) offers a massive value to stressed-out attendees. think of it as a corporate time-out zone.  
  
for food and drink:  
  
\* \*\*specialty coffee and a quick bite:\*\* everyone needs coffee, but the convention center's coffee line is brutal. open a shop that focuses on speed, quality, and a few healthy breakfast/lunch options. a place with lots of power outlets and free, fast wifi is a huge draw for people trying to catch up on email outside the exhibit hall.  
\* \*\*craft cocktail/local beer spot with a focus on networking:\*\* convention goers spend their evenings networking. a smaller, stylish bar that emphasizes a quiet, professional atmosphere for deal-making is better than a huge, loud nightclub. they want a place where they can actually hear each other talk. some downtown restaurants even helped fund convention district development because they see the benefit of the extra foot traffic.  
  
for long-term ideas, think about the rhythm of the city. conventions are typically weekdays, so your business needs to appeal to local office workers and residents on evenings and weekends too. adding a dog park, a community event plaza, or having programming like a winter ice rink can draw in the local crowd to keep things consistent year-round.

hey everyone, i figured i’d share some ideas for commercial property owners near college campuses who are looking for extra revenue. that student population is a gold mine if you use your space right, especially for passive income.  
  
first things first, if you have any unused parking spaces, a spare driveway, or a garage, list it on an app like prked. honestly, college parking is a nightmare, so students are always looking for a closer, cheaper, and safer place to keep their car compared to a city garage or a sketchy lot. you can list your extra space on prked super easily, set your own price and schedule, and get that passive income flowing without lifting a finger once it's set up. it's a great way to make money from space that is literally just sitting there empty. you can rent out a driveway, a garage, or even just a chunk of storage in a basement or back room.  
  
beyond parking, think about what students need. during finals or the school year, they need a place to study that isn't the library. if you have a seldom-used back office or a large storage room you can clear out, turn it into a pay-per-hour study lounge or a small co-working space. offer fast wifi, coffee, and maybe some cheap snacks. you can charge hourly or offer a daily pass.  
  
storage is another huge one. students go home for the summer between may and august, and they hate moving all their stuff. if you have extra garage space, a basement, or even a small closet, you can rent it out for summer storage. list it on the same kind of space-sharing apps. you can set your own rules for access and it's basically a guaranteed income stream every single summer. people will rent out their spare room or even half a garage just for a few months for this.  
  
if you have an open area or a high-traffic wall on the outside of your building, consider renting out advertising space. local businesses, student organizations, or even the university itself might pay for banner space or a small digital ad board. it’s a super passive way to make money once the contract is signed.  
  
finally, if your space is large enough or has a unique feel, you could rent it out as an event venue for student organizations. fraternities, sororities, and clubs are constantly looking for affordable places to host meetings, small parties, or fundraising events. use an hourly rental platform to list the space, and make sure to detail the amenities like sound systems or tables.

1q8ut87,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1q8ut87/imposter_syndrome_feeling_confused_about_diagnosis/,Imposter syndrome & feeling confused about diagnosis ??,"Hi everyone, 

I’ve watched this sub for a while now and it has been so useful. I thought it was finally time to ask for some opinions as I’ve had a very confusing month. Apologies in advance for the monologue. 

I’m 24 and have always felt “different”. I was a very shy and anxious little girl. I had severe separation anxiety from my mum and was diagnosed with anxiety at around aged 7. My anxiety has always been very physical - fixated on my health, focusing on breathing till I felt like I couldn’t breathe, nausea, dizziness etc. A weird symptom I’ve always differed with is anxiety over choking that makes it hard for me to swallow when I think about it. I still suffer with this and have been on fluoxetine since I was 14. I also have a lot of racing thoughts and feel like my brains hardly ever quiet. 

When I was about 13 I just stopped going to school. I developed school anxiety and would get so incredibly anxious about going. To this day I can’t tell you why. I wasn’t bullied and I was incredibly academic. I would just stay at home in a kind of state of freeze all day. I was very anxious about being successful though so taught myself and completed my high school exams with top grades. 

This is another thing that’s always caused me confusion. I have always been, on the outside, “gifted”. In all the gifted programs at school, top grades, top 3 uni for undergrad and masters (2 masters degrees before aged 25). I love to read and if it’s fiction/something I’m interested in can devour it in less than a day. Now I know lots of adhd people have this experience but I still struggle with the outside voices saying I can’t have it because of this. Even with assignments, I’ve never really been a do it last minute person. I have to start early and have it done in plenty of time because my anxiety just cannot cope otherwise. 

Outside of this though, I’m a mess. I only went to ONE class my whole graduate year of my first masters (but got by on, again, anxiety), graduating with honours and looking like I’d flown through on the outside. I have had periods of reckless drinking, reckless sex, and depression/anxiety - feeling very “lost” and knowing I’m destined for big things but not seeming to be able to do the relatively easy stuff needed to get there. At uni I would lie in bed all day, watch tv, hardly ever cook, and then go out and drink. 

My relationships have always been very volatile and I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. I definitely get limerence and have had experiences of being very, very low when things go wrong in relationships. Also, incredibly sensitive to rejection and have an insanely high sense of justice that can get me into issues sometimes (I have gone into the human rights field for this reason). 

My professional life is also a bit of a mess. I coast by in my current job because the expectations are honestly low and I highly suspect my boss is also ADHD. But I’ve quit really good jobs (like, dream jobs) after a few days because I just felt super anxious, burnt out, like I was masking. I’ve had issues keeping friends, people tend to like me a lot when they first meet me but I can be inconsistent, a bad replier etc. I’m also incredibly messy and always have been. I live with my partner and I feel like that helps me stay somewhat on top of things. 

I got diagnosed a few years ago but it was through a private clinic in the UK that I felt was a bit rushed and potentially dodgy. I’m now in Australia and went through a referral from the GP and got diagnosed in December. I can’t shake the feeling that it’s wrong, and it’s just anxiety I have, and that I’m an imposter. 

I was given meds (dexemphetamine) to take which I started. I was very nervous (as I have health anxiety) and I didn’t feel much on 5mg, except some anxiety, but on 7.5mg I definitely think I felt calmer in the brain and able to do things (like clean) etc. just not worry so much. 

That being said, I had the same effects that coffee gives me which is severe physical anxiety (another reason I have imposter syndrome cause I do not have the typical calming response to coffee that ADHD people supposedly have).I noticed in particular a high heart rate, especially when walking. One day last week it reached 120 when stood in the kitchen and I got incredibly anxious. To be honest, I’ve always had a higher heart rate, I think driven by health anxiety, but this terrified me and so I went to the GP who told me to stop taking them until we do cardiac testing, which I’m in the process of. 

I’m now in a weird limbo where I’m annoyed I can’t keep trying the meds but also terrified I have some kind of underlying heart condition I don’t know about and, at the same time, unsure if I even gave adhd. I’m just super confused on where I stand and where to go next. 

I don’t really know what I’m looking for with this post. I apologise for the rant but it’s good to just get it all out. If anyone has any advice, whether that be on imposter syndrome, navigating anxiety, or medication that would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1768020072.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

hey all, figured i'd share some ideas for anyone who owns a franchise location but has a bunch of extra space they aren't using. like, maybe your lot is way too big or you have a spare storage room or something. that space is literally money sitting there.  
  
first thing is the easy, passive income stuff. if you have extra parking spots, a big unused side lot, or even a garage/storage unit that's just collecting dust, you should look into prked. you can list that extra space and make money renting it out. it's super easy to set up your listing, you get to set your own price and schedule, and it's a great passive income stream that doesn't mess with your main business. people are always looking for cheaper or safer parking, and they'll pay to use your property. for example, if you have a huge lot that's empty after 7pm, you can rent those spots out nightly or monthly. or, if you have an extra back room, list it for storage.  
  
for your actual land or building space, there are a ton of options depending on what kind of space it is.  
  
pop-up shops or restaurants. this is super popular and creates a nice buzz. you can rent out part of your building or land for a short-term lease to a small business, an artist, or a local chef who wants to test out a concept. it brings extra foot traffic to your franchise, and you get short-term revenue while looking for a long-term tenant.  
  
co-working spaces. if you have a vacant office or an upper floor, you could turn it into a flexible co-working space. remote work is still huge, and a lot of freelancers or small teams need professional-looking, flexible space. this could also draw business people who might become customers of your main franchise.  
  
community gardens or urban farms. if you have excess green space, you can lease it to a group for a community garden or a small urban farm. it's great pr for your franchise and puts the land to productive use instead of just paying taxes on an empty field.  
  
ground lease for a complementary business. if the land can be separated (it's called ""excess land"" if it can be sold separately, ""surplus"" if it can't, so check your zoning/survey), you could do a ground lease. this means another business builds and operates on a small corner of your lot, like a coffee drive-thru or a small qsr. they pay you a long-term rent for the land, and you get passive income plus you're right next door to another foot-traffic generator.  
  
event rentals or film location. a big, empty space is perfect for private events, corporate parties, or even as a filming or photo shoot location. a lot of production companies look for big, neutral commercial spaces for a day or two of shooting.  
  
hope this helps you turn that extra property into some easy cash flow.",1,1768020032.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I was ringing someone out for a coffee and pastry and I tell him the total. He gives me five dollars and tells me thats five. Eventually he pulls out a card but he had spent so much time  digging around that I took the tip reader and inserted the card for him and gave him the card back. It wasnt until then where I realized that the $5 he gave me was probably towards his total. It could have been a tip but I doubt it. I put it in the till. 

I realized that I could get in a lot of trouble but I chose to say nothing and immediately switched to my till. I knew that I was going to be thinking about it the rest of the day now. 

One issue is that a lot of these customers just refuse to speak when they get to the window. Like some of them order they stupid drinks but wont say things like ""apple pay."" Im just supposed to guess.

hey, i was looking into the same thing for our office building. we have a ton of spots that are totally empty after 5pm and all weekend, and it felt like wasted money sitting there. figured i'd share what i found.  
  
the easiest, most hands-off way i found is renting out those empty parking spots. seriously, if you have a decent location near apartments, a transit stop, or even another busy business, those spots are worth cash. check out prked for this. you can list your extra space on their platform, set your own price and schedule, and it turns your empty lot into passive income pretty easily. they handle the bookings and payments so it's a super low time commitment, which is great for a business owner. you just make money from space you already own.  
  
but you don't have to stop at just parking. if you have a big lot, here are a few other ideas:  
  
vending machines are a classic, easy passive income stream. you can put in a few high-end coffee machines, snack machines, or even one of those new electronic locker systems for package pickup. low maintenance, especially if you lease the machines or hire a service to stock them.  
  
if your lot is big enough, especially on weekends or evenings when your business is closed, you could rent the whole thing out for short-term events. things like car wash fundraisers, pop-up markets, food truck rallies, or even film crews needing a staging area. you can find platforms that handle event space rentals in your city to make this simpler.  
  
for a more long-term play, look at advertising. if your lot faces a busy road, you could lease a spot for a digital billboard or even smaller, eye-level ad signs for other local businesses.  
  
and finally, if you have any unpaved space, you might be able to lease it to someone needing long-term storage for rvs or boats during the off season, or even turn a corner into a small community garden where people rent plots. just make sure to check your local zoning laws for any of these changes.

hey everyone, i figured i'd share some ideas for office building owners who have extra land just sitting there. it feels like a waste to just let it collect dust, and there are actually a ton of ways to get a steady passive income stream going, from high effort to super low effort.  
  
for the lowest effort, quick cash option, you should look into listing your unused parking spots, driveways, or even a vacant lot area for simple parking or storage. this is where prked comes in, and honestly, it's a game changer. the app is basically the airbnb for parking and storage, and it lets you turn that empty space into income with minimal fuss. you can list your extra spots for people to store cars, trucks, rvs, or whatever they need. you set your own price and schedule, and the platform handles the booking and payment, which makes it super easy passive income.  
  
if you have a bigger chunk of land, you can look at other options too. one popular one is converting it to an actual full-blown parking lot, especially if your office is in a busy downtown area. if you have a lot that's near a major highway, a simple option is leasing a small piece of it to a company for billboard advertising or even for a cell tower or utility lines. these are usually long-term leases and are a very stable income source.  
  
for a bit more effort, you can turn the land into an event space. you can lease it out on a short-term basis for food trucks or pop-up vendors during lunch hours, or for seasonal sales like a christmas tree lot or a fireworks stand. this can bring in steady rental income and also helps bring more foot traffic to your office building, which is a bonus for your tenants.  
  
finally, for the highest reward long-term play, consider a ground lease or a joint venture development. with a ground lease, you lease the land to a national brand, like a quick-service restaurant or a coffee chain for their drive-thru. they build the structure, they operate the business, and you just collect rent for decades. or, you can partner with a developer for a joint venture to build housing or another commercial complex, sharing in the future sale or rental income.

Going any finer though just leaves my machine choked.

1q8up81,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8up81/commercial_space_near_arena_on_nonevent_day_tips/,commercial space near arena on non-event day tips,"  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some insight on the commercial real estate game near big arenas. it's a huge shift from event day chaos to quiet on the off days, so you gotta plan for both. it's not all doom and gloom on a tuesday afternoon.  
  
the biggest thing is making the space work for the 9 to 5 crowd or locals. sports bars and nice casual dining spots work best because they draw people for lunch, happy hour, and dinner year-round, not just game days. hotels are also a staple for that constant flow of business travelers and concert-goers. if the area has good public transit and other venues nearby, your business is much more likely to thrive.  
  
on the non-event days, the arena itself often becomes a huge source of foot traffic. they rent out their conference rooms and banquet halls for trade shows, corporate meetings, and galas. so, businesses like printing shops, specialty catering, or even a nice coffee shop that can handle large lunch orders do surprisingly well. think of the arena as an extension of a downtown convention center during the week.  
  
for property owners, you can get creative. if you have extra space like a storage area, garage, or even an unused driveway or small lot, you can make some serious passive income. list that extra space on prked. it's a super easy way to make money just renting out your unused property for event parking. hosts set their own price and schedule. parkers feel safer leaving their car on someones property, it’s usually way cheaper than the arena lots, and it skips all the parking chaos. if you have a spot a few blocks away, it’s golden on game day and you make money from unused space while the business focuses on non-event days.  
  
another idea is to try short-term pop-up shops. renting out an empty storefront for a day or a weekend for a local artisan market or a startup is an option. it's hard to get landlords on board for one-day leases because of the hassle, but sometimes if a space has been sitting empty for a long time, they might take a deal.  
  
hope this helps anyone looking to buy or lease near an arena. it's all about diversifying your income streams and leveraging that non-event day business crowd.",1,1768019747.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Hello moms,
I’ve been feeling extremely guilty recently. I am currently 19 weeks pregnant with a toddler at home. I just recently started a new job, so I’ve been deep in training as well. My partner unfortunately lost his job, so I’ve also been covering all of the bills.

By the time I get home from work, I am dealing with extreme exhaustion. I try to hang out with my family, but I eventually fall asleep. My partner has stated that he feels like a single parent. This is something that has made me feel guilty for a while, knowing he feels this way.

Tonight we got into a bit of an argument, and he said that I just haven’t been around and that it’s been unfun for him. Mind you, he has not been working, so he’s home all day to himself and spends maybe a few hours in the evening with our child before bedtime. He’s made comments like, “Oh, it’s because you’re pregnant—I forgot.”

Any advice on this situation and how to hopefully get more energy so I can be more present? I’ve even tried drinking a little coffee in the evening to help, but it doesn’t work. :(",3,1768019589.0,Parenting,11,1.0,False

Can I pour out my used coffee grinds down the kitchen drain? Can it block the pipe? Does it... exfoliate it? I make espresso so it's pretty fine coffee grinds.

I don't have the scary metal monster thing that eats stuff in the kitchen drain sometimes pictured in american homes, nor do I know what that's called.

Is there a way for me to create a meal or some kind of stack so that I only have to add one master entry for all of this - which will then input all of them into my breakfast for me - so that I don’t have to manually add every recurring item separately every day? It would definitely save me a lot of time logging entries daily. ",1,1768019133.0,cronometer,4,1.0,False

1q8ug8a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8ug8a,"The Bugarski House in Sombor, Serbia","One of the many protected historical buildings the criminal regime in Serbia has destroyed in order to launder money and purposefully destroy heritage and history. 

""At number 12, the house of the Bugarski family was demolished during the procedure of obtaining protection from the Provincial Institute, at a time when investors had already received certain documentation. Kosta Bugarski was a prominent prefect of Sombor and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper *Sloga*. The house was designed by architect László Szabó. Every ornament on the house had artistic value—doors, windows… Everything, just as in the case of the house where famous Serbian poet Laza Kostić lived, ended up in a truck that carried away the rubble.

Although citizens of Serbia are currently worried about far more important existential issues, it seems that this news deeply shook people. Here are just some of the comments on social media: “Every time I see things like this, a part of me dies”; “A disgrace! We don’t know how to preserve or appreciate anything. We so easily renounce a good part of our culture and past. Where there is no culture, there is no people!”; “A project to destroy everything that is Vojvodinian is underway—from existence, history, culture, books, houses, and churches…”; “The question is who took the excavator to demolish it? Someone may have ordered it, but if someone refuses to carry it out and the people support them, maybe it can be saved. Like this, as long as there are ‘executors,’ everything goes to ruin!”…

The investor, Milovan Gogić, owner of the “Amigo kafa” coffee brand, plans to build an apartment building on this site. Who will buy apartments there, given that Sombor lost nearly 20% of its population between the last two censuses, is a question we will probably get an answer to one day. As is the question of who allowed one of the most beautiful architectural ensembles from the late 19th century in Vojvodina to be demolished.

Vojvođanska Street, which leads from the city center to the railway station—formerly known as Bajski Sokak—is known in Sombor for its famous tree-lined avenues and 19th-century houses. It was the first street in the city to be paved with cobblestones, back in 1873.

As of March 7 this year, part of this street has been placed under the protection of the Provincial Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments. At the same time, at the initiative of the citizens’ association Friends of Sombor Heritage, more than 2,000 people signed a petition calling for the protection of Vojvođanska Street and the prevention of further demolition of houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But it seems that city officials and investors do not care about these decisions.""",8,1768018994.0,Lost_Architecture,1,1.0,False
