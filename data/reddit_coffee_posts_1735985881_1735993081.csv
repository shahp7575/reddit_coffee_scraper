1htd756,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1htd756/i_had_a_massive_panic_attack/,I had a massive panic attack. ,"Good morning, for context, this happened about 5-6 months ago. I work in the funeral industry and have been responsible for organizing and executing funeral honors for deceased veterans. This is a job I’m extremely good at, like to do, and take great pride in, and I’ve done upwards of a thousand. 

I’ve always had depression and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety in addition when I sought treatment, but it didn’t feel like it really “fit” me. I’ve always been a tightly-wound person, and with hindsight, a lot of my involuntary bodily twitches seem to align with that diagnosis, but it was hard for me to accept. 

Anyway, the incident. I was getting ready to do my last funeral of the day, and I was sitting in my van with coworkers minutes before we needed to get staged. All of the sudden, my entire left arm went numb, I was nauseous, I felt sick to my stomach, I had an intense chest pain, and my heart was beating out of my chest. My coworkers were even able to see my chest jutting out, violently. I thought it was a heart attack, but I was clear of mind and was determined to finish the service. I’m used to performing under pressure, and I executed the service as if everything was fine. 

We immediately drove to the ER, running lights, while I kept pumping my left fist, doing breathing exercises, and talking myself through it. I passing my now-wife’s number off so they can inform my family, and had my other coworker call our boss to explain the situation. 

I had these symptoms for an hour and a half, until the nurses put me to sleep. When I woke up and talked about my medical history, they told me it was a panic attack. I was a healthy 23 when it happened, so I thought it was improbable but I didn’t have any other explanation. I’ve had panic attacks before, I got them frequently as a teenager, but not like this. 

Ever since it happened, I found a doctor that prescribed me a medication that prevents these, and also reduced the amount of twitches I’ve been having. I’m terrified of getting my heart rate up, now. I’ve been dodging almost all caffeine, and working out, something I love, has been difficult because I keep feeling my heart rate increase and it reminds me of the hour and a half of sheer pain. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences? I’ve had a doctor question why they ruled out a heart attack because, they did an x-ray, heard I had anxiety, and told me it definitely wasn’t a heart attack. It didn’t help them when I confessed that I had a cup of coffee on the way. ",1,1735992942.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1htd6du,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/1htd6du/honestly_labor_share_will_the_one_thing_that/,"Honestly, Labor Share will the one thing that pushes Amazon into a Union","It's highly unpopular amongst the work force, everyone hates it. No other job makes you 'labor share' from your job duties; I think I read an example here on Reddit. 

'The accountant doesn't get sent to fetch coffee, the sales person doesn't get sent to work the production warehouse, the administrative assistant doesn't get sent to do the groundskeeping'  

Actually with a union if you get assigned a job duty that isn't part of your job description a shop steward or union representative comes to the manager and yells at them 'find someone else to do that job, that's not his job!' 

If Amazon really wants to do Labor Share it has to be designed in this way:  
 1. Labor Share is voluntary not mandatory  
 2. Only the associates manager can offer Labor Share to them.  
 3. Labor Share is incentivized with higher pay ($2 more per hour)

1htd5eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1htd5eq/bringing_in_other_people/,Bringing in other people,"Hey, so there's this guy I'm seeing. It's either a really intense friendship or a partnership - he does a lot of stuff we would do in a partnership, minus the physical intimacy, and our mutual friends have asked about how close we are. Our main mutual seems to think he likes me but is holding back, as it would be a gay relationship. Anyways point is, we spend a lot of time together just the two of us - pretty much 6 to 12 hours almost every day for the last two months. We're also next door neighbors, being part of a very close knit community of houses, kind of a communal living situation

Anyways, the night before yesterday I sent him a text about how much I trust him etc cause some of my friends have been telling me to be careful lately as he ""switched"" on me one night, becoming verbally aggressive - a night he claims not to remember as we had been drinking (it was my birthday). I txted him night before yesterday saying that I know the real him, I know he's a good person and I'll never abandon him (on New Years Eve we spent the night at his and he said he was afraid I'd end up deserting him at some point like everyone else does)

Also something really sweet he's started doing is cooking me food. It's been awkward as all my food is in his fridge so I have to wait until we meet that day to access it. But he always cooks the greatest food, so it works out well. And I even mentioned in the txt how much I appreciate the food

Well yesterday, he said that he'll be cooking for one of the other neighbors now as well. When we went for morning coffee, he had invited a bunch of people around - usually it's just the two of us. I felt a little weird at the lack of a headsup (I haven't mentioned anything about it to him as it would make me sound jealous) so I went home after the coffee. Another reason I went home is cause he said he had watched four episodes ahead in the show we're watching, despite the fact that he said to me the day before I could watch ahead if I want (it's a show he's seen before) and I said I wouldn't watch without him as we're watching it together. Even one of mutuals at coffee told him that that's cheating - the moment he mentioned watching it, she said it. He seemed completely surprised at this

Anyways yesterday when it was time for dinner, he texted me to tell me to invite my nearest housemate to join us. The housemate wasn't available. When I got to pwBPD's, he said that two other friends (a couple) and the friend he'd also be cooking for this weekend were unavailable. Then throughout the meal, he barely said a word. There was a very strange vibe in the air?

I left after that. Txted him asking was there a strange vibe or was I overthinking, and he said that it was my overthinking (that's something he's called me out on a lot)

That night another neighbor called me over, to have some ""sugar"" - something I got introduced to when first meeting pwBPD. He also invited pwBPD over. pwBPD kept telling him he should let him cook for him one week. Again, until yesterday this cooking for me was very much something I viewed as special between the two of us. I know it's stupid to get upset at it but he kept bringing people in yesterday, right in front of me. There was also one point where he mentioned the show Good Omens and said the show was written by one of his favorite authors, Terry Pratchett. I told him the show was done by Neil Gaiman (a former favorite author of mine) and he said the show was done by both of them (truthfully, the show was NG - the books came from both) Didn't really know how to respond so said nothing. Then he said this silence is very eerie. Other guy said the place had definitely gotten quiet during the winter and pwBPD said that people can sense when there's a strange vibe in the room (vibe being the exact word I asked him about in regards to dinner) He left shortly after that

Then around an hour later, pwBPD texted me asking was I still in the guy's room. I said I had gone home. He asked me could I throw him one of the bags but that we wouldn't be chilling as a mutual friend had just finished visiting him and pwBPD's dog had gotten growly. Dude expected me to throw him 100 worth of my stuff, have it all himself and not hang out with me when he had been okay with chilling with someone else? Plus the dog loves me
I told him no - that I share bags, I don't give them away. That the bags would probably still be there next time he actually wants to chill as sugar wasn't an addiction for me, company is what makes me happy
He said he could pop up to mine for a bit but at that point I was so in my head about everything so said let's leave it off, at which point he agreed to let's have a sesh on Monday instead

I told him I need some alone time, so don't worry about me and food tomorrow. He said I can have space and still eat, he'll drop dinner up to me. I thanked him and said he was a good friend, I've just been thinking weirdly all day, to which he said it's cause we had so much alcohol New Years Eve that our thoughts can be fuzzy afterwards

***
How does this whole scenario sound? It's weird he became a mindfuck again the morning after I told him I trust him completely. It's weird he's suddenly started inviting everyone into our things and seems uncomfortable now being alone in a room with me. And tbh, I'm kind of thinking I should just skip food today. All my food's at his but him suddenly getting everyone else involved has kind of ruined how special I found it. Not going to txt him to call off dinner (he'll just say I need to eat) but if he goes knocking on my door with it, I'll pretend not to be home",1,1735992749.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False
1htd4lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1htd4lf/coffee_shop/,Coffee Shop,"I'm not sure if this is AP or not but in my dreams there is a recurring coffee shop. The way to get there is always the same (up the road) and the shop's interior always looks the same as well. It doesn't exist in waking life but rather, it seems to be an echo of memories. Like an amalgamation of multiple shops and cafes I worked at or frequented over my life time in different cities. It's always bustling with customers who appear as a blur to me unless I interact with them, then they come into focus. Lol the service is always questionable and the manager is always the same guy and kinda of a rude jerk to staff and customers. 
I just woke from another visit to this place (and never did get my americano and cherry pastry) and can't help but wonder what the hell this is. Astral business? Do you experience something similar? What are your thoughts on this? ",1,1735992659.0,AstralProjection,1,1.0,False
1htd2vq,https://i.redd.it/s5ktaunvwyae1.jpeg,Do you have dietary restrictions or preferences that prevent you from consuming raw eggs??,"As a seasoned chef specializing in Italian desserts, I’ve always been captivated by the enduring charm of tiramisu. Tiramisu senza uova, or egg-free tiramisu, offers a modern take on this classic treat, delivering a lighter, safer alternative without compromising the indulgent flavors that have made tiramisu a global favorite. This recipe is ideal for those with dietary restrictions or preferences avoiding raw eggs, guaranteeing a creamy, delectable dessert everyone can savor.

Tiramisu senza uova
Ingredients for Egg-Free Tiramisu
For the Cream Layer
500g mascarpone cheese
200ml heavy whipping cream (cold)
100g powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
For the Coffee Soak
300ml strong espresso or coffee (cooled)
2 tbsp coffee liqueur (optional)
For Assembly
300g ladyfingers (savoiardi biscuits)
Unsweetened cocoa powder (for dusting)
Step-by-Step Guide: How to Make Tiramisu Senza Uova
1.Preparing the Cream Layer:
In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until it reaches soft peaks. Gently fold in the mascarpone cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

2. Creating the Coffee Soak
Brew a strong espresso or coffee and let it cool. For extra depth of flavor, add a splash of coffee liqueur if desired.

3. Assembling the Tiramisu senza uova
Dip each ladyfinger briefly into the coffee soak. Be careful not to oversaturate.
Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers in a serving dish or pan. Evenly spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat with another layer of ladyfingers, finishing with the remaining cream on top.
4. Finishing Touches
Dust the top generously with cocoa powder. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight, to enhance the flavor.


Why This Recipe Works
My Professional Insights
Tiramisu senza uova offers a safer and more versatile dessert option without compromising on flavor or texture.The whipped cream creates a light and airy texture, while the mascarpone adds the rich creaminess that is signature to tiramisu. By focusing on quality ingredients like robust espresso and authentic savoiardi biscuits, this recipe guarantees a dessert that’s both indulgent and approachable.

Serving and Storage Tips
Serve chilled, garnished with an extra dusting of cocoa powder or freshly grated dark chocolate for an elegant presentation. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to three days. This dessert is ideal for preparing ahead, as the flavors intensify over time.

1htd1qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1htd1qv/seeking_feedback_on_8day_february_trip_itinerary/,Seeking Feedback on 8-Day February Trip Itinerary With Wife,"Here is my extremely detailed itinerary for your perusal. My wife thinks I am crazy but I do want to make the most out of this trip. We will have the 6-day Paris Museum Pass and are doing most of the highlights. We had wanted to do a day-trip to Normandy D-Day Landing sites but replaced that with Disneyland Paris instead (wife's choice due to me lugging her around to so many museums!).

We will be staying in the Saint-Martin Canal area and mostly plan to walk and use the metro everywhere.

**A few questions:**

1. Is this plan too ambitious? Is there any museums/attractions worth skipping or replacing with something else? I have also included planned exploration times (based on averages). Please let me know if I should increase or decrease any.
2. What kind of weather should we plan for? Currently we are planning for cold weather (i.e. 3-10 deg C) with intermittent rain. Is there any special considerations or planning I should do for weather?
3. Do you have any restaurant/cafe/bar recommendations? Especially any hidden gems.. We tried for a mix of $$ and cuisines/specialties' in current list. Let me know if anything I have chosen is overpriced, overhyped, etc. Also, what would be a good place for a romantic dinner with the Wife for Valentine's Day, and where does one find the best Crème Brûlée in the city?
4. I have about four hours to kill between 6-10PM on Tuesday by myself. I believe most of the museums are closed by then. What should I do?

Thanks in advance for all your comments and for taking the time to review my itinerary!

1htd1a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1htd1a3/f4f_lets_create_a_fantasy_epic_in_an_urban/,[F4F] Let's create a fantasy epic in an urban fantasy world! [Discord][Adv. literate],"Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea and coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least one post per day, and the ability to write more often is appreciated. While real life always comes first, it is a hard requirement. If you know you can't do that, for any reason, I'm not the writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the writing is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me as a collaborative writer is that I come pretty much empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything from scratch together with my partner! I really do mean everything, be it the setting, the lore, the characters, the magic system, all of it! The main exception are mainly monsters and other fantastical creatures that I may, or may not outright ~~(and not at all shamelessly)~~ steal from DnD, video games, other media and folklore! This also means that if you happen to already have a constructed world with detailed lore, I will not be very interested. It is not a perfect approach, but well, I do not believe in perfect, and it is what works for me!

This also does mean that, in the best case scenario, it may take us up to a week before we can actually start, and that *is* **the** optimistic estimate.

A very important thing is where lies my main source of inspiration, and that's the j-RPG genre of video games. On one hand, it does mean that I want to use the tropes and storytelling conventions common in those, so long they don't translate too poorly to text. What *is* the more important thing though is the story structure that I prefer for my roleplays, which is akin to that of a DnD session! Specifically that rather than *just* the two co-protagonists I want to control a whole travelling party with my writing partner, that will come from town to town, brave different dungeons, face many vile antagonists, while the overarching threat looms over the horizon! I love action, I love tension, and what do I even love more?! Steaks! Stakes! I mean stakes! Not *necessarily*, but very possibly up to the world-ending variety!

Anyway...

What is the exact plot, and what are going to be the dominant themes are something that I want to decide on together! Now, what do I have a hard preference on is the setting, which I want to be an **URBAN FANTASY!** What I mean by urban fantasy is a world where magic is hardly a secret hidden from the world of the 'muggles' and is common knowledge, often being combined and intertwined with the more mundane sorts of technology! While medieval fantasy is NOT my preference, I still tend to utilize a great deal of medieval fantasy tropes. I just love to put a more modern spin on them! Such as, a monster-slaying guild that operates as either a modern-day corporation or a government service, such as the fire department, with all the good and bad that both imply! Now, how advanced is the setting supposed to be, THAT is something I am not set on. At the moment, I feel I have a preference for something akin to Final Fantasy VII or VIII developmentally-wise, though I'm not terribly sure. However, as long as our prospective world has at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I may want to stress that at least at the moment of writing this very post, I am not interested in a pre-industrial fantasy story. I've already got one, and I don't exactly hunger for more!

I have mentioned action, and I believe it may be a wise to write a paragraph on it, as well. Putting it this way: while my characters would be little more than cannon fodder in particularly overpowered universes such as Dragon Ball or the Invincible, they would still be considered OP by the standards of more grounded, realistic settings. By which I mean things such as swordsmen cutting through scores of armed modern soldiers, the dodging and parrying of bullets with bladed weapons, or allegedly human characters that can somehow wrestle with bears or wield swords that should quite literally break their backs. In other words, a good degree of willing suspension of disbelief is pretty much required! So, do let me know if all that sounds up your alley!

I also absolutely love to have ensemble casts in stories! Which means that the ability to write characters that vary by gender, age\*, social background, moral alignment, personality, and more, is pretty much a requirement! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! Another reason it is so important is that I love to explore a wealth of different character dynamics within a story, and for that, you need diversity!

\*That said, the vast majority of the cast should be 21+, if not 25+

As for the lead character, I'll see what I come up with once we actually get to planning! The only thing I know for certain is that at the moment of writing this advert, I prefer that neither of our lead characters come from a military or police background. Well, that and that they both ought to be women, but that should go without saying given the tags I used... right? I should also mention that typically, I prefer to write characters in their early-to-mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't 100% off the table, I cannot promise that you'll be able to actually convince me to go down that road.

While I do not outright require that our lead characters have to become romantically involved, I am probably not the person for you, if you dislike or avoid writing romance in general.

I also may want to say a couple more words about romance. While I have a hard preference for the main pairing, that being FxF, I do prefer writing partners that can write all three main gender combinations. Why? That's simple! I like variety, and I just do not find it very realistic, or immersive if it's only ever one of these present in the story! I also just generally consider it a major green flag in a writing partner!

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I will prefer to stay here, before actually moving there. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

1htczx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1htczx9/akka_superbiotics_for_liver_detox_does_it/,Akka Superbiotics for Liver Detox: Does It Actually Work?,"I wanted to share my thoughts on **Akka Superbiotics**, which I tried recently after dealing with constant bloating, low energy, and what felt like an impossible struggle to lose weight. If you’re considering it, I hope this review gives you a better idea of what to expect—both the good and the not-so-good.

# What Is Akka Superbiotics?

Akka Superbiotics is a supplement designed to improve liver health and metabolism. It’s built around **Akkermansia**, a probiotic that plays a crucial role in gut and metabolic health. The idea is that when your liver and gut are functioning well, your body can detoxify itself better, burn fat more effectively, and even improve your energy levels.

What stood out to me is that Akka uses “Preserve Pasteurized” Akkermansia, which they claim is gentler on your system compared to live probiotics. It’s also paired with ingredients like **Quercetin**, **Resveratrol**, and **Silymarin**, all known for their liver detoxifying and anti-inflammatory benefits.

# Why I Tried Akka

For context, I’ve been struggling with bloating after meals, low energy, and stubborn belly fat that just wouldn’t go away no matter what I did. I tried cutting carbs, working out more, and even those “detox” teas, but nothing really made a difference.

When I read about how important the liver is for fat metabolism and detoxification, it clicked for me. The Akka supplement focuses on supporting liver health, so I figured it was worth a try.

# My Experience with Akka Superbiotics

Here’s how it worked out for me over the first two months:

**Weeks 1-2:**  
I didn’t notice anything dramatic at first. There was a slight reduction in bloating after meals, but I wasn’t sure if that was from Akka or just me being more mindful about what I was eating.

**Weeks 3-4:**  
This is when I started seeing actual changes. My energy levels were more consistent, and I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons like I usually do. The bloating became less noticeable, and I felt lighter overall.

**Month 2:**  
By the second month, I felt a significant improvement. My digestion felt smoother, and I noticed my cravings for junk food had reduced. I even started losing a bit of weight—not a lot, but enough to feel a difference in how my clothes fit.

# What I Liked About Akka Superbiotics

* **Improved Digestion:** The bloating and heaviness after meals almost disappeared, which was a big win for me.
* **More Energy:** I didn’t need that second (or third) coffee to get through the day anymore.
* **Reduced Cravings:** This was unexpected, but I found myself reaching for fewer sugary snacks.

# What I Didn’t Like

* **It’s Pricey:** Akka isn’t the cheapest supplement out there, especially if you’re going for the multi-bottle options.
* **Takes Time to Work:** If you’re looking for immediate results, this might not be the product for you. It took about three weeks before I noticed any real changes.
* **Not a Cure-All:** While it helped, it’s not a magic solution. You still need to pair it with healthy eating and regular exercise.

# Should You Try Akka Superbiotics?

If you’ve been struggling with bloating, fatigue, or stubborn weight gain, **Akka Superbiotics** could be worth considering. It’s not going to give you overnight results, but over time, it might help you feel more balanced and energized like it did for me.

That said, if you’re someone who’s already taking good care of your liver and gut health, you might not notice as dramatic of a difference.

# Final Thoughts

Overall, I’m glad I gave Akka Superbiotics a try. It wasn’t a game-changer, but it did make a noticeable difference in my digestion, energy levels, and overall sense of well-being. I’d recommend it for anyone who feels stuck and wants to try a new approach to supporting their liver and gut health.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea and coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least one post per day, and the ability to write more often is appreciated. While real life always comes first, it is a hard requirement. If you know you can't do that, for any reason, I'm not the writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the writing is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me as a collaborative writer is that I come pretty much empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything from scratch together with my partner! I really do mean everything, be it the setting, the lore, the characters, the magic system, all of it! The main exception are mainly monsters and other fantastical creatures that I may, or may not outright ~~(and not at all shamelessly)~~ steal from DnD, video games, other media and folklore! This also means that if you happen to already have a constructed world with detailed lore, I will not be very interested. It is not a perfect approach, but well, I do not believe in perfect, and it is what works for me!

This also does mean that, in the best case scenario, it may take us up to a week before we can actually start, and that *is* **the** optimistic estimate.

A very important thing is where lies my main source of inspiration, and that's the j-RPG genre of video games. On one hand, it does mean that I want to use the tropes and storytelling conventions common in those, so long they don't translate too poorly to text. What *is* the more important thing though is the story structure that I prefer for my roleplays, which is akin to that of a DnD session! Specifically that rather than *just* the two co-protagonists I want to control a whole travelling party with my writing partner, that will come from town to town, brave different dungeons, face many vile antagonists, while the overarching threat looms over the horizon! I love action, I love tension, and what do I even love more?! Steaks! Stakes! I mean stakes! Not *necessarily*, but very possibly up to the world-ending variety!

Anyway...

What is the exact plot, and what are going to be the dominant themes are something that I want to decide on together! Now, what do I have a hard preference on is the setting, which I want to be an **URBAN FANTASY!** What I mean by urban fantasy is a world where magic is hardly a secret hidden from the world of the 'muggles' and is common knowledge, often being combined and intertwined with the more mundane sorts of technology! While medieval fantasy is NOT my preference, I still tend to utilize a great deal of medieval fantasy tropes. I just love to put a more modern spin on them! Such as, a monster-slaying guild that operates as either a modern-day corporation or a government service, such as the fire department, with all the good and bad that both imply! Now, how advanced is the setting supposed to be, THAT is something I am not set on. At the moment, I feel I have a preference for something akin to Final Fantasy VII or VIII developmentally-wise, though I'm not terribly sure. However, as long as our prospective world has at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I may want to stress that at least at the moment of writing this very post, I am not interested in a pre-industrial fantasy story. I've already got one, and I don't exactly hunger for more!

I have mentioned action, and I believe it may be a wise to write a paragraph on it, as well. Putting it this way: while my characters would be little more than cannon fodder in particularly overpowered universes such as Dragon Ball or the Invincible, they would still be considered OP by the standards of more grounded, realistic settings. By which I mean things such as swordsmen cutting through scores of armed modern soldiers, the dodging and parrying of bullets with bladed weapons, or allegedly human characters that can somehow wrestle with bears or wield swords that should quite literally break their backs. In other words, a good degree of willing suspension of disbelief is pretty much required! So, do let me know if all that sounds up your alley!

I also absolutely love to have ensemble casts in stories! Which means that the ability to write characters that vary by gender, age\*, social background, moral alignment, personality, and more, is pretty much a requirement! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! Another reason it is so important is that I love to explore a wealth of different character dynamics within a story, and for that, you need diversity!

\*That said, the vast majority of the cast should be 21+, if not 25+

As for the lead character, I'll see what I come up with once we actually get to planning! The only thing I know for certain is that at the moment of writing this advert, I prefer that neither of our lead characters come from a military or police background. Well, that and that they both ought to be women, but that should go without saying given the tags I used... right? I should also mention that typically, I prefer to write characters in their early-to-mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't 100% off the table, I cannot promise that you'll be able to actually convince me to go down that road.

While I do not outright require that our lead characters have to become romantically involved, I am probably not the person for you, if you dislike or avoid writing romance in general.

I also may want to say a couple more words about romance. While I have a hard preference for the main pairing, that being FxF, I do prefer writing partners that can write all three main gender combinations. Why? That's simple! I like variety, and I just do not find it very realistic, or immersive if it's only ever one of these present in the story! I also just generally consider it a major green flag in a writing partner!

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings

1htczlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mengetbetter/comments/1htczlg/how_to_actually_stop_procrastinating/,How to actually stop procrastinating,"Hey everyone,

I’d like to share with you a story and my own findings on how to actually stop procrastinating.

It’s been a very rocky road to get to where I am now - actually getting work done, not feeling super overwhelmed by the smallest task imaginable and being emotionally healthy (to some extent)

Soo, lets get started. I’ve been a serious procrastinator all through high school, college and even after I finished all that and got my first job. I was a perfectionist and doing any work felt like moving a mountain. I would often wait till the last moment to start studying for exams and then I would rush only to realize I should have started earlier.

In my career after college, trying to start my own business procrastination just really postponed “success” and what I could have been by now. When you are “your own boss” and you set your own tasks with no one to hold you accountable, getting work done was super hard for me. I would stagnate, watch movies in bed, watch stupid TikToks, go for long walks, go get coffee with my friends, watch motivational videos, … you name it, I did it. Instead of sitting down and just starting to do even the tiniest bit of work, I procrastinated like a m*\*\*\*\*\*rf\*\*\*\*\*r.*

I only realized I seriously needed to solve that problem when my bank account was getting empty and I had almost no income.

That is when I started to read everything about procrastination, why it happens, how to stop and listening to my body and mind. Only after that I discovered why I do that and how I can solve it.

Soo, without further ado, let me tell you how I actually stopped procrastinating and how you can do it too.

Procrastination doesn’t mean you’re being lazy or you’re bad at managing time. At its core, it’s an emotional issue. We avoid tasks because they feel uncomfortable. Maybe they seem too hard, too boring, or too overwhelming. Instead of dealing with that discomfort, we distract ourselves with things that feel good in the moment, like scrolling through social media or binge-watching movies (for me it was LOTR). There is a really simple thing you need to understand here: procrastination is problem of emotional resistance, and not how much effort you put in.

To stop procrastinating, you don’t need a better to-do list or the latest productivity hack. You need to reframe how you approach the tasks you’ve been avoiding. You can start by recognizing that every “big” task is just a series of small, manageable steps. The problem arises when you look at the entire thing as one huge f\*\*\*\*g mountain. For example, if you need to study for an exam, your brain immediately jumps to hours of effort, stress, and hard work. But in reality, the first step might be as simple as opening your book or sitting down at your desk. That’s it. Once you take that first step, the rest will often fall into place naturally.

The reason tasks feel overwhelming is because we attach too much emotional weight to them. We convince ourselves they’re harder than they really are. This isn’t logical and it usually means our emotions are taking control. To break free of this, you need to disrupt that pattern of thinking. Remind yourself that the task itself is likely far simpler than you believe it is. Studying for a test isn’t really that hard, it’s just reading, reviewing notes, or solving a few problems. Cleaning your room isn’t a massive obstacle, it’s picking up one piece of clothing at a time. By reframing tasks in this way, you take the emotional resistance out of the equation.

Next.

Action is the ultimate cure to procrastination. The hardest part is starting because our emotions are loudest before we begin. But once you take even the smallest action, things become much easier. If you’re stuck watching videos instead of working, don’t tell yourself, “I need to study for five hours.” Instead, just pause the video. That one small action sets everything in motion. Once the video is paused, it’s easier to close the tab. Once the tab is closed, it’s easier to open your book. Before you know it, you’re already working, and the resistance is no longer there.

Procrastination basically fuels on your avoidance and grows stronger the longer you let it direct your life. The key is to stop giving your emotions the power to decide what you do. You control your feelings, not the other way around. Recognize and accept what you are feeling and take control. It’s normal to dread studying and yes, it can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t reflect reality. The task isn’t as big or difficult as you think it is. By changing your perspective and focusing on the smallest possible step forward, you can break the cycle of avoiding what you need to do and actually get it done.

Remember, the process is really simple: start small, focus on the next achievable action, and let momentum do the rest. Don’t overthink it. Just start. Once you’re moving, everything else becomes easier. The power to beat procrastination isn’t in pushing yourself harder and hating yourself because you’re procrastinating; it’s in understanding the root of the problem and taking control of your emotions.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea and coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least one post per day, and the ability to write more often is appreciated. While real life always comes first, it is a hard requirement. If you know you can't do that, for any reason, I'm not the writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the writing is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me as a collaborative writer is that I come pretty much empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything from scratch together with my partner! I really do mean everything, be it the setting, the lore, the characters, the magic system, all of it! The main exception are mainly monsters and other fantastical creatures that I may, or may not outright ~~(and not at all shamelessly)~~ steal from DnD, video games, other media and folklore! This also means that if you happen to already have a constructed world with detailed lore, I will not be very interested. It is not a perfect approach, but well, I do not believe in perfect, and it is what works for me!

This also does mean that, in the best case scenario, it may take us up to a week before we can actually start, and that *is* **the** optimistic estimate.

A very important thing is where lies my main source of inspiration, and that's the j-RPG genre of video games. On one hand, it does mean that I want to use the tropes and storytelling conventions common in those, so long they don't translate too poorly to text. What *is* the more important thing though is the story structure that I prefer for my roleplays, which is akin to that of a DnD session! Specifically that rather than *just* the two co-protagonists I want to control a whole travelling party with my writing partner, that will come from town to town, brave different dungeons, face many vile antagonists, while the overarching threat looms over the horizon! I love action, I love tension, and what do I even love more?! Steaks! Stakes! I mean stakes! Not *necessarily*, but very possibly up to the world-ending variety!

Anyway...

What is the exact plot, and what are going to be the dominant themes are something that I want to decide on together! Now, what do I have a hard preference on is the setting, which I want to be an **URBAN FANTASY!** What I mean by urban fantasy is a world where magic is hardly a secret hidden from the world of the 'muggles' and is common knowledge, often being combined and intertwined with the more mundane sorts of technology! While medieval fantasy is NOT my preference, I still tend to utilize a great deal of medieval fantasy tropes. I just love to put a more modern spin on them! Such as, a monster-slaying guild that operates as either a modern-day corporation or a government service, such as the fire department, with all the good and bad that both imply! Now, how advanced is the setting supposed to be, THAT is something I am not set on. At the moment, I feel I have a preference for something akin to Final Fantasy VII or VIII developmentally-wise, though I'm not terribly sure. However, as long as our prospective world has at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I may want to stress that at least at the moment of writing this very post, I am not interested in a pre-industrial fantasy story. I've already got one, and I don't exactly hunger for more!

I have mentioned action, and I believe it may be a wise to write a paragraph on it, as well. Putting it this way: while my characters would be little more than cannon fodder in particularly overpowered universes such as Dragon Ball or the Invincible, they would still be considered OP by the standards of more grounded, realistic settings. By which I mean things such as swordsmen cutting through scores of armed modern soldiers, the dodging and parrying of bullets with bladed weapons, or allegedly human characters that can somehow wrestle with bears or wield swords that should quite literally break their backs. In other words, a good degree of willing suspension of disbelief is pretty much required! So, do let me know if all that sounds up your alley!

I also absolutely love to have ensemble casts in stories! Which means that the ability to write characters that vary by gender, age\*, social background, moral alignment, personality, and more, is pretty much a requirement! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! Another reason it is so important is that I love to explore a wealth of different character dynamics within a story, and for that, you need diversity!

\*That said, the vast majority of the cast should be 21+, if not 25+

As for the lead character, I'll see what I come up with once we actually get to planning! The only thing I know for certain is that at the moment of writing this advert, I prefer that neither of our lead characters come from a military or police background. Well, that and that they both ought to be women, but that should go without saying given the tags I used... right? I should also mention that typically, I prefer to write characters in their early-to-mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't 100% off the table, I cannot promise that you'll be able to actually convince me to go down that road.

While I do not outright require that our lead characters have to become romantically involved, I am probably not the person for you, if you dislike or avoid writing romance in general.

I also may want to say a couple more words about romance. While I have a hard preference for the main pairing, that being FxF, I do prefer writing partners that can write all three main gender combinations. Why? That's simple! I like variety, and I just do not find it very realistic, or immersive if it's only ever one of these present in the story! I also just generally consider it a major green flag in a writing partner!

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I will prefer to stay here, before actually moving there. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

I hope to hear from you, and I hope you have a wonderful day or night!",1,1735991872.0,roleplaying,0,0.99,False

He had dropped off their Christmas gifts from the both of us to his Father.  We both recognized we weren’t going to see them at this time since we were working through things.  This is the response we received yesterday.

Dear xxxx (my husband) and xxxx (me),

Thanks for your response and Christmas wishes and gifts too. Thanks too for your patience. We have been, and continue to be, prayerfully considering the text and your emails. We very much desire and look towards having a harmonious relationship, just as you do. We continue to seek God's counsel in His Word and Holy Spirit and with a wonderful Christian counsellor, especially to help me in regards to the roots of the deep despair triggered from receiving the text.

From your emails xxxx (my husband), and from a lot of thinking back, I am understanding that you (she’s referring to me), feel hurt or frustrated when I ask too many questions, such as with the glasses.  To you it seems as if I am interrogating you. I'm sorry you were upset and I will do my best to not ask too many questions. If in the future there are times you feel I am asking too many questions, or have a critical tone, would you please help me by letting me know at the time, in a way I will recognize? It seems I have missed indications in the past, so perhaps an agreed upon signal could work - maybe a light touch or putting your hand over your heart or something else?  This will help me to recognize in the moment and make a correction when I need to step back, say something differently, or perhaps not at all. :)

In regards to the time after the soccer game, we recognize that we over-stepped. I was really looking forward to seeing xxxx (dog) and playing with him and xxxx (grandchild). I asked to come see him and xxxx (my husband) you said it wasn’t a good idea. I pushed and your dad was sure it would be fine since we'd just be outside for a short bit then leave. We did not respect your request and we are very sorry for that. We do want to respect boundaries.

We realize that you have other situations that are troublesome and that you may want to discuss. Would it be an option for the four of us to meet somewhere for coffee/tea so that we could talk together and more importantly, pray together? We love you both very much and want to be a blessing to you.

We are praying for you and for us in all of this,
With much love,

I need a recommendation on what kind of espresso machine to buy sub $500 if possible.

I’m not a coffee snob by any means but I love a good frothy espresso shot every morning. Occasionally a milky drink (maybe 3x/month)

I used to have a Krups 2-in-1 espresso/drip coffee machine (idk the model, really old) and I could never seem to pull a consistent shot of espresso with it. I mean the machine sucked but it was probably user error as well. I watched tutorials, tried all the tricks, never got a froth.

I want to pull a nespresso type shot (easy, frothy, consistent) without doing the whole pod deal.

Wants:
- machine to help with consistent shot pulling
- ideally built in grinder/tamper
- optional milk wand (less important)
- machine to be as easy as possible 
- no plastic machinery 

Basically the easiest machine that will get me a consistent espresso every morning without much thought.

No mods to the machine, no attachments, additional machines required.

I’m located in Europe (Spain).

I’ll be honest, as much as I enjoy having a cup of coffee, if I don’t doctor it up with cream and sugar, I cannot enjoy the actual taste of coffee. 

So this Christmas, I said, I’m gonna take the standard drip coffee system up a notch and get myself an espresso machine at home. I went with the new Ninja Lux Cafe. I know it’s not Breville or anything professional, but it’s a start into making espresso at home. 

Am I actually supposed to enjoy the way the pure espresso shots taste, alone, or am I doing something horrible wrong? I’ve tried three different beans now, including locally roasted beans and HuckleBerry Roaster’s Blue Orchid blend. 

It all tastes like the same (somewhat) burnt coffee taste to me. Now when I use it to make a latte or cappuccino, it’s delicious and smooth. But alone? It’s disgusting.

Found out after he moved countries to be with me, considering emailing his ex for closure while he's away hiking. Bad idea?","When me and my BF met he was 23 and I was 19, we met on an language exchange app and we were learning each other's respective language. It was January 2018, in August 2018 after months in which the conversations were getting more and more flirty and intense he told me that he loved me and I responded equally. Things got always more pervasive and I sent him my first nude picture, which I had never sended to anyone on the internet before, so believe me, I really trusted him and felt very intimate with him.

In the fall of that same year, probably November, he sent me a picture in which a whiteboard was showing behind him with his name + a woman's name in a heart, I panicked, I let it flow thinking it might be the name of a little cousin of him or something like that. Then I had a breakdown and I confronted him, he indeed had an official girlfriend. He was extremely apologetic, we talked for the first time on the phone for 7+ hours and the situation was utter sufferance for me and for him too. In my head, I thought that he'd leave her after this episode and all the love he admitted having for me. I gave him some time while we were still in contact, and then things started getting intense again between us. I asked him if he was only mine, and he responded affirmatively, so I understood that he had departed from that relationship. During the two years that followed, we grew closer and were in constant contact through messages, audios, calls, and video calls, in a way that only romantic and sexual partners do. I asked him many times during this period if he was only mine, and he always confirmed it. Finally, in October 2020, two years later, he came to my country, and we met in person. The day we met felt like we had always known each other and always been with each other and behaved like that.

He stayed in my country for 3 months, then I went for a university exchange to his country for 6 months, then he came to my country again for 3, then I went to his country again for some time again, you get the gist. Just a note, our countries are quite far (12,000 km) and all of this was quite expensive for 2 young people. Anyway, 2022 and 2023 were the years of navigating bureaucracy and after a lot of stress and frustration we managed to do everything so that he could come to my country to work (where he'd make a little less than in his country). We were beyond happy. On the 31st December of 2023 I decided to ask him a question to leave this past bug in the past and start 2024 in a fresh way, little did I know lol. The question was 'When exactly did you break up with your ex after I found out?' he told me August 2020!! Literally a couple of months before we met for fucks sake, and 2 years after he first said he loved me, and 1.5 years after he confirmed he was only mine. I couldn't and didn't want to believe what I heard. He said he was not proud of what happened, that he just didn't want to hurt anyone, that his ex had up and down periods, and that he saw us both happy so he carried the weight on his shoulder to keep both parallel relationships going, eventually breaking up with her to start a relationship with me when was a good time, like when he had the financial means to come etc. I started 2024 heartbroken. The first weeks were awkward, then I decided that I needed to stop focusing on that because I needed to both work and write my thesis. I don't know if the usage of this term is correct here, but I'd say I started dissociating from this and everything apparently came back to normal. Apart from some weird thoughts, insecurity, and jealousy related to this that sometimes would colonize my mind.

Fast forward to now, January 2025, I am in his home country and he went for a hike of 6 days in which there is going to be zero signal for a good part of it and I started thinking that maybe I could get some closure from meeting with his ex and giving us both the truth. The thing is that 4 +years passed from their breakup and from what a friend has told me she always made a face when the name of her ex was mentioned in some conversation. However, this friend met her first sort of fresh after the breakup so this might be something from the past. Also, before coming to his home country I also had a short breakdown remembering the past New Year's in which I found out this and told him that I am still not over it and I need some closure. He asked me if I wanted him to talk to her and I said no. He had the chance to clarify when he broke up and he didn't, I don't want them to reconnect on this and for him to shape this story from his possibly sweetened perspective and I feel like I need to meet this person to get the closure. Am I being unreasonable?

Yesterday I spent several hours drafting an email to send to her, in the first version I blurted out everything and in the second I just invited her to meet me. You can find the text underneath. I would love to meet her and close this topic for good, however, if she didn't respond or she contacted him directly I'd feel maybe even in a less ""closed"" situation. What would you do in this situation? Don't suggest breaking up or anything of the sort, I love him and he loves me, our relationship just happened to start in a very unfortunate way.

Second version of the email cleared from real names and places:

>Hello X,

>I hope you’re well. You don’t know me, but I’m the girlfriend of your ex. I remembered your name from a photo I saw on his social media some time ago and that is no longer there, and that’s how I was able to find your email by trying a few combinations. I’m writing to you because there’s something important I believe you don’t know and that, until recently, I didn’t know either. Something that deeply impacted me and intertwined us unknowingly during a significant period of both our lives.

>I’m writing now because I’m alone in this city and thought this might be an opportunity for a dialogue, as I’m not from here, and it’s rare for me to be here, and also alone. I’d like to invite you for coffee in a public place of your choice, if you feel comfortable, to share something that might clarify certain things from the past.

>Before sending this email, I drafted a much longer one explaining everything I’d want to know if I were in your position. However, I believe it’s more respectful to let you decide whether you want to hear me out and create a space for mutual communication. I completely understand if you’re not interested in learning more about something tied to your past, especially if it might involve complicated emotions. Still, I sincerely hope you can see this message as an honest and respectful attempt to address something that, at least for me, remains unresolved. For you, it might already be settled but perhaps with some missing pieces, and I feel it’s time to fully close this chapter.

>I would be very grateful if you decided to respond, but I respect that you’ll do what feels best for you. This type of email is undoubtedly uncomfortable to receive (and no less uncomfortable to send, believe me), but I’m writing with good intentions, even if nervously, as it’s a topic I find difficult to face.

>If you decide it’s not the right time or you’d rather not respond, I’ll completely understand. But if you’re open to what I suggested or have another idea, I’ll be available between tomorrow and next Wednesday. If you’d like to contact me, this is my number: 0000000000.

>In any case, I trust your sensitivity in this conversation between women and your discretion, just as you can trust mine. I hope I’m not causing too much annoyance, in that case, please forgive me, ignore this message, and I won’t contact you again.

>Sincerely, Z.

**TL;DR**: Met my (F25) BF (M29) in 2018 via language exchange app when I was 19. After months of flirting and getting intimate online, I discovered he had a girlfriend but he led me to believe they broke up.

I’m a first-time dater (M25), and I could really use some advice. I live in Tambaram and work in Chennai, so if you know any good date spots here, I’m all ears. But most importantly, I’m curious about how dating works in Chennai – I’ve got a lot of questions, and I’m hoping you can help me out.

Here’s what’s on my mind:

1. How do people usually meet in Chennai? Is online dating common? Are there any trustworthy apps I should check out?


2. How do you know if you're talking to a real person and not a scammer? Any tips for spotting the red flags?


3. What are some good first date ideas around Chennai/Tambaram? Is it better to go for coffee, a nice dinner, or maybe somewhere like Marina Beach? Is a movie okay for the first date or is that a no-go?


4. What do I talk about? I don’t want to sound too awkward or like I’m overthinking it. Any conversation topics or things to avoid?


5. Is it okay to show physical affection on the first date? Like, is holding hands alright? Should I bring flowers or is that too forward?


6. What’s the deal with age? Can I date someone older than me here? How do people view that in Chennai?


7. This might be the weirdest question, but... Is it okay to date a married woman in Chennai? I know it’s a bit of a taboo subject, but I genuinely want to understand the cultural perspective on this.



I’m really nervous and overthinking everything, but I want to make this a good experience. How do Chennai folks handle all this? What should I know about dating in the city? Any advice or tips would be much appreciated!

1htcn0f,https://i.redd.it/3ibgo6qdryae1.jpeg," Eilish No. 1, 2, 3 - a newbie's perspective","I stumbled into the world of perfumes (or is it ""finding my scent""? idk) around August 2024 and started collecting in November. I’m no expert, but I think it’s fun to share my thoughts on the Eilish line. So here goes!

Eilish No. 1
Thoughts: Vanilla with a swirl of milk and dark chocolate.
Pros: Insane longevity on clothes!
Cons: Moderate sillage—kind of expected from a vanilla scent.

This smells like wholesome coffee and dessert dates. It’s sweet and creamy, but there’s a dark, woody note that keeps it from being overly sugary. My personal favorite because it’s comforting and versatile!

Eilish No. 2
Thoughts: Black pepper and incense, but in a surprisingly wearable way.
Pros: It’s bold and very commanding. Definitely a ""boss"" vibe.
Cons: Feels more like a skin scent—I haven’t tested its sillage much since I rarely wear it.

This smells like bad bitch energy. Think of an independent woman in a black leather jacket with spikes, riding a motorcycle at night. It’s bold, bossy, and perfect for date nights or clubbing. A total confidence booster.

Eilish No. 3
Thoughts: 🎄CHRISTMAS🎄 vibes all the way!
Pros: Unique and comforting—a completely different vibe from No. 1 and No. 2.
Cons: Not really an ""everyday"" scent for me, but I just got it today, so maybe I’ll discover more.

It smells like cozy winter nights (wow, kala mo taga-US haha): eggnog, snuggles, blankets, and lazy afternoons reading a Harry Potter novel. There’s a lot of grapefruit and pine tree scent, giving it a festive feel.

Wrap-Up:
I’m planning to expand my collection and treat myself to a new perfume every two months! I already have a list, but feel free to give recommendations!

Also, I decided not to rate them because I think each scent has its own moment, and comparing would feel unfair. :))",3,1735990615.0,fragheadph,0,1.0,False
1htcmq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1htcmq2/if_christianity_is_true_then_it_is_unethical_to/,"If Christianity is True, Then It Is Unethical to Have Children","Good morning! (or whenever you are!)

[I discuss this topic over a cup of coffee this morning if you prefer to engage that way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFJokN-Bfm4)

I hope all is well in your life. Today, I want to discuss the ethics surrounding bearing children under the assumption that Christianity is true.

In short, since the Jesus directly tells us, ""few will find the gate which leads to life"" (Matthew 7:13), I think, that from the Christianity perspective, having children might be unethical.

Now, let me throw out my own counterpoints out the gate:

1. the bible says to be fruitful and multiply.

2. the glory of heaven will out-weight the eternal damnation in hell, despite the ""few"" to ""many"" ratio.

Those are the two most solid counterpoints I have been able to draft up without digging miles deep. Maybe someone will bring a fresh perspective.

Here is my line of reasoning.

1. If we have a child, we create a life which may go to heaven or hell

2. We cannot control our child's salvation (look into Pastor children deconversion rates)

3. Since we cannot control our child's salvation, and most are on the path that leads to destruction, having a child is to create a large potential for eternal suffering.

4. Creating the risk of eternal suffering in others is not conducive for their wellbeing.

5. Therefore, having children is unethical due to the uncontrollable risk.

I mostly use v60 for one cup (either 01/02) splitting pours into 5x 50g or 40g bloom + 3x 70g, both ending with drawdown at around 3:15. I usually grind my beans to around 26-28 commandante clicks.

This one is diffrent. I'm constantly getting a drawdawn at 2:00. I tried going finer, didn't solve the issue (if it even is one in the first place). What's been getting on my nerves though is the bloom. I tried using up to 60g of water, pouring slowly or quickly, but the bed will never get to the point when i can get that satisfying swirl. It always ""errupts"" and no matter how much water I feed it, it seems to never be satisfied. To be honest, it might not even be an issue. I don't know, I'm genuinely curious how to deal with such bloom. I just want to do the beans justice.

The coffee does indeed taste nice, but that's not the point. I know it can taste **way** better and that's my ultimate goal.

Though I'm having a vulvoplasty, I tell most of my coworkers that I'm having 'THE' surgery and leave it at that. If they genuinely have more questions, I don't mind giving more details, but tempered by what is appropriate for my workplace.

I work third shift, and there's substantial overlap with overtime hours. Up to five hours with second shift and an hour and a half with first shift. And, only a few know know anything more than surface details. One is a first shifter, that I typically never run into unless we're on overtime. They got to know me for my upbeat personality, and willingness to assist. So, we would chat. Yesterday morning, I helped them with a task, and they asked to exchange phone numbers, so we meet together for coffee. I've been cordial with this person, and they seemed curious about my life, enough to explain the basics of my upcoming procedure.

I was floored when they asked if I was open to changing my mind. I replied with the equivalent of ""Excuse Me"", and reminded them my procedure was a couple weeks away, and I returned to working. And I had their phone number.

I waited until later yesterday to text them, asking why they thought that I was open to having my mind changed, with my procedure a couple weeks away, and that I already had an orchiectomy. I'm in the midst of a process I've started years ago, so I'm not casually going to change my mind at this point.

A tasty fish, an Italian red vine, the black coffee with a dark chocolate and the next episode of the TV series, we are watching these days. One episode every week. No less and no more. Very good tempo for the better digestion of how the tense narrative is going. It's Ripley TV Mini Series from 2024. It's perfectly black and white. Every scene is looking like some iconic frame from the Italian history. The TV series is based on Patricia Highsmith's 1955 crime novel The Talented Mr. Ripley. And the first edition of the movie was The Talented Mr. Ripley is a 1999 American psychological thriller film written and directed by Anthony Minghella.

1htc623,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1htc623/easy_workflow_and_good_quality_700/,Easy workflow and good quality [€700],"Thinking if I should upgrade my current setup - DeLonghi La Specialista to something higher quality, but I don't want to sacrifice the workflow. I also don't want to sacrifice my kidney, so the budget is around 600 - 800 eur.

TLDR: Ease of use is a priority, so basically same as I have now with just a higher end grinder.

Let me explain:

1. I only drink lungos (min 3 per day, more with guests over) - about 10g in a single shot basket to get 80ml liquid. I'm not stuck on any magic ratio, just dialing according to taste. I like the 80ml as a quantity - not too short so i'm done in 2 sips, and not too long and getting cold by the end americano
2. I use medium roast freshly roasted coffee from a local roaster that I like the flavor of

Current setup pros that I would like to still have:

1. Quick machine warmup time - I can have coffee whenever I feel like, and it doesn't need planning
2. Grinder dosing - just push the button and you get the pre set dose directly in the portafilter.
3. Puck preparation - it only needs leveling and tamping (or even just tamping), no wdt tool, no special sequence or too much work

There are no real complaints about the current setup, except that I notice that even when grinding on the finest setting, the liquid still comes out quite fast. I don't mind it as I like the taste that I get at the end, just wondering if it's worth having that extra fineness available as I might then like what I get even more, or even give me the option to venture into lighter roasts (so far has been unsuccessful due to high acidity I end up getting with everything light that I've tried).

Things that are a NO-NO when I consider upgrading:

1. Beans measuring and single dose grinding in a cup - it's just too much work for me, I will end up hating it. I often have family over, it will take me 30 min to make 4 cups in a row, and it's impossible to explain the process to the other family members, so it has to be quick and easy.
2. Long warm up time - if it's more than 2 min warmup I will give up drinking.
3. Countertop real estate - the solution needs to be sleek and not take up too much space

I don't think it's worth upgrading to Sage Barista Pro (or Touch) as it's not an upgrade enough for the 300 € difference. Do you have other suggestions?",1,1735988575.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

But it takes more than slapping ads on a website.

It’s strategy, consistency, and some number crunching.

Here’s how you can do it, minus the fluff.

# Start With Real Questions

Why isn’t my AdSense making much?

How do people actually hit $100 daily?

What traffic do I need?

Let’s break it down like we’re at a coffee shop talking numbers.

# How to Make $100 a Day on AdSense

# 1. Nail the RPP Method

Research. Publish. Promote.

This is your game plan, no exceptions.

* **Research:** Find *profitable niches* with tools like SEMrush or Google Ads Keyword Planner. Look for high CPC keywords—these pay the big bucks. Example: *Finance CPCs can go over $25 per click!*
* **Publish:** Make content people care about. Write blog posts, make videos—whatever gets clicks. Quality over quantity.
* **Promote:** Use **SEO** to rank your content. Blast it on social media. Email it to your list.

The more eyeballs on your site, the closer you are to $100/day.

# 2. Know Your Numbers

AdSense success is a numbers game.

**Here’s the formula:** Earnings = CPC × CTR × Pageviews (PV)

**Let’s break it:**

* CPC (Cost Per Click): How much you earn per ad click.
* CTR (Click-Through Rate): % of people who click ads.
* PV (Pageviews): How many people visit your site.

**Example:**

* CPC = $0.50
* CTR = 2%
* Pageviews = 10,000

**Earnings = $0.50 × 0.02 × 10,000 = $100**

# 3. Traffic Matters Most

Don’t guess how much traffic you need. Calculate it:

**Pageviews Needed = $100 ÷ (CPC × CTR)**

If your CPC is $0.50 and CTR is 2%, you need **10,000 daily views**.

Increase either CPC or CTR, and you need less traffic.

# 4. High CPC Niches = Faster Earnings

Not all niches pay equally.

* *Finance, insurance, and law*: $10–$25 CPC.
* *Lifestyle or hobbies*: $0.50–$1 CPC.

Focus on niches that pay.

Then create value-driven, clickable content.

# Should You Only Rely on AdSense?

AdSense is great, but let’s be real.

Ads alone won’t make you rich.

**Here’s a smarter play:** Sell your own products while running ads.

* **AdSense**: Passive income from clicks.
* **Selling Products**: Higher profits per sale.

Use platforms like **ClickFunnels** to:

* Create landing pages.
* Build sales funnels.
* Maximize your revenue per visitor.

This way, you’re not leaving money on the table.

# Statistical Truths You Should Know

* It takes time to build AdSense income. *Example: One user made $152 in nine months before scaling to $1,000/month.*
* CPC and CTR vary. Most beginners see $0.10–$0.50 CPC with a 1–3% CTR.

# Pro Tips to Boost AdSense Revenue

1. **Focus on Mobile Traffic:** 70%+ of internet traffic is mobile. Optimize your site for mobile users.
2. **Ad Placement Is Key:** Place ads *above the fold* for higher CTR. But don’t overload your site—it scares visitors away.
3. **Experiment and Adjust:** Test ad types, placements, and sizes. Your goal is to balance clicks with user experience.
4. **Leverage SEO:** Rank for high-intent keywords. More targeted traffic = higher ad revenue.

# Why Combine AdSense With Products?

Here’s the bottom line.

AdSense is a start, not the finish line.

Selling products—physical, digital, or services—can triple your income.

Ads pay for clicks, products pay for *value*.

A blended approach (ads + products) can skyrocket your earnings.

Think *AdSense income* covers the basics while your products bring in the real profit.

# Final Thoughts

Earning $100 a day on AdSense is doable.

But it’s a numbers game + hustle.

Optimize for clicks, but think bigger.

1htbyfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1htbyfc/losing_two_really_close_friends_during_pregnancy/,Losing two really close friends during pregnancy,"Maybe I just need some advice. I've always been quite a straight forward person, as in if we have a problem let's talk about it and discuss it. I'm having problems with friends that don't think this way.
Friend A: friends since HS, we had a couple of rough fights over the past two years, always when drunk. Once she called me a slut for dancing in a club with a gay guy. Second, we fought because she wanted me to be in a relationship with a guy I wasn't ready for, when I told her to back off, she stormed out drunk into the night. Third time we were out for her birthday and she left me alone drunk with her friend and I was really upset at her for leaving me drunk without saying goodbye (""you were having fun!"") so we fell into a screaming match in the middle of the night. Next day we had this extensive chat where I told her why I felt so betrayed. We didn't see eye to eye, she was upset I yelled at her (bcs of trauma with her mom). Since then our relationship was strained. Still over months to come we tried hanging out more, but it just wasn't it. Then my wedding came, she came, had great fun but got really drunk. I didn't. But everything was fine. Next day I asked how's the hangover, she said fine and quickly brushed me off saying she's going back sleeping. Didn't hear from her for a month. I pinged her and asked if she wants to go get coffee and to our friends business opening. She said she doesn't have time. I said ok ping me when you want to go for coffee. She thumbs upped me. I asked ""Is everything ok? You'd tell me if there's anything wrong between us?"" and she replied ""I'm not ok. I don't want to talk about it. I love you."" and I said ""I understand, I'm here for you if you need anything"". And we hadn't spoken for a month. Inbetween I got pregnant, so at 3 months I told her and two other friends we have a group chat with. She responded with ""congrats"" and a gif of a baby... my other friend reached out and asked all about how I'm doing. Nothing from friend A. It's been 5 months now and still nothing. I'm feeling really resentful because I made myself available to her and she seems to be ghosting me - wants to end this friendship. It sucks because I have a feeling it has to do with her personal trauma of what's all happened when she was drunk but Idk. I don't know because she wont tell me. And I don't want to reach out the third time when she showed zero interest in my life. 

Friend B: friend from work quickly became a bf. Everything was good until my pregnancy when she just started offering her advice about pregnancy all the time. I appreciated it until one day I had a positive scan news and told her just to be met with her ""but don't trust any doctors, they are wrong all the time!"", hearing this after being anxious and finally getting good news made me upset so I told her that. To which she responded ""ok thanks for explaining"" and then following up with ""you weren't a good support for me when I was pregnant, I know you weren't pregnant before, but you called my baby Damien"". I was shocked by this. I was constantly by her side during her pregnancy because she had major relationship issues during as well and she confirmed I was. I couldn't help with pregnancy advice because I was never pregnant. She said she was so insulted and so hurt everytime I called her baby Damien. It was a joke. She was constantly explaining how tired she is because of the baby so I jokingly called him Damien (from the movie The Omen) and she always laughed at this joke, even said ""Damien doesn't let me sleep"" at the time. But now, suddenly, she was insanely hurt everytime I said it. And I asked why is she telling me this now, 5 years later?? Why didn't she say something and I'd apologize and stop. Or maybe even later, when she wasn't pregnant anymore. And she responded ""I can't imagine having to tell someone why this would be hurtfull, it's selfexplanatory"". I was and still am pissed because of this. I feel like this is just a rebuttal to our fight and she wasn't really as insulted back then OR she is really insincere and good at faking. Why couldn't she tell me before?? Does she really feel I had any bad intents with this joke? And now I feel like we're completely different and incompatible.

Now I feel like two of my close friends are just going away and all I ever wanted was just for them to be truthful with me. I'm stuck between feeling really sad and abandoned (specially by friend A) during pregnancy and feeling kind of angry at them and just saying ""screw this"".

I lived a life that was not plagued by disease. My longings were human, and my throat had never dried from screaming. My brother never had to weep by my lifeless body. That afternoon, I never took the bottle to the bridge. Instead, I returned home and my cat was there to greet me. My book never sat in the shelf collecting dust. My lover never had to pry my body free from the freezing waters. I didn't have to question if the devil was bad if he, too, drowned in his melancholy every night. My body was never at war with itself. I never had to wonder how many people I left behind, shackled by my unfulfilled promises. My friend never had to try and shake me back to consciousness. In my dream, I hoped that when I became one with the soil, it felt like my mother carrying me to my bed when I fell asleep reading a book on the couch.

We communicate everyday, for several hours by text in between whatever we're doing. We've recently fallen out because I find it odd that he doesn't tell me what his plans are. I find out his activities in passing after the fact. He doesn't communicate them as they unfold whereas I tend to communicate pretty much everything. 

The plans themselves currently don't have a bearing on anything as it's a distance relationship but if we're to progress it sets a communicative style where I have to specifically ask him if he has plans to find out anything. It also feels weird that we talk to much but actually I don't know that much about what goes on in his life.

It came to a head when he'd been for coffee with a friend and mentioned it in passing. We'd been texting all the time. I asked when it was arranged and he said the day before and I thought wouldn't that be the sort of thing you'd mention to someone you're constantly in communication with? ""Oh I just arranged to meet....."" Or ""I'm just in my way to meet ......"" Or ""I just got back from meeting......""

I had such a lovely couple days with my friend yesterday and I was looking forward to see him and when I came home everything was fine for about half an hour till he went downstairs to make food and realised there was some of his bacon gone that he was going to use for pasta. 

He constantly buys food and leaves it in the fridge to go off so I used some bacon without asking but still left more than enough but he just lost his mind. Instead of just cooking his food he stormed upstairs said he was leaving the house. Then when he saw I was getting dressed to go to the shop for him to replace it he told me to just stop being ridiculous and just leave him alone and don’t speak to him. So I just sat down in the cold kitchen all evening. (Which he turned back on me and said why should he have had to be alone all evening).

This morning he gets up and gets mad at me when I had just woken up so I can’t actually remember what he said but something along the lines of I never take him into consideration and that I just moped around the house to make him feel bad. And he got mad at me for not having any pictures of him on my wall with the pictures of my friends, so I’ve just had to take them all down. Then hes stormed out he’s rang me saying he’s getting a coffee and he’ll be a while cause he’s not ‘allowed’ to go to a certain place because there’s a woman working there that he was seeing when we broke up before. I never said he couldn’t go there. Not even once.

I feel like I’m treading on eggshells with everything. He’s hungry. He’s tired. He’s driving. It’s absolutely everything. 

He came back from getting coffee and stormed out again saying he’s moving out and he doesn’t have to put up with this shit and that he just wants to be left alone and that I should go out with my friends tonight when I KNOW for a fact if I even meet them today while he’s gone it will start more drama. I’m just at loss I have literally 0 people to talk to this about.

These issues are literally just from the last couple days but it’s just constant. I can’t do anything right and he makes me feel like I do things out of maliciousness (like not having a picture up of him beside my friends) but I just forget to do things, I’m such a go with the flow person I don’t do things to be mean or get back at people I just don’t think.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're looking to enhance your outdoor living space, a round fire pit table with a hidden propane tank can be an excellent addition. These versatile pieces not only serve as a focal point for gatherings but also offer several practical benefits that make them popular among homeowners.

### Stylish Design

A round fire pit table brings a unique aesthetic to your outdoor setting. Their sleek circular shape fosters conversation, making everyone feel included. These tables come in various materials, including wood, metal, and stone, enabling you to choose one that matches your patio decor. The warm ambiance created by the fire adds a welcoming feel, perfect for evening gatherings with family and friends.

### Convenient Propane Storage

Perhaps one of the most significant advantages of a round fire pit table is its ability to conceal the propane tank. This hidden storage makes your outdoor space more visually appealing and minimizes clutter. No longer will you have an unsightly tank sitting in plain view. Instead, the propane is neatly tucked away, maintaining the elegance of your fire pit table.

### Safety First

Safety is a top concern when enjoying outdoor fires. Fire pit tables that hide the propane tank are designed with safety in mind. The hidden design prevents accidental bumps into the tank and reduces exposure to the elements, extending the life of your equipment. Plus, these tables often come with safety features, such as an automatic shut-off system, ensuring peace of mind while you enjoy the warmth.

### Ease of Use

Using a round fire pit table with a hidden propane tank is straightforward. Simply turn on the propane, ignite the flame, and you’re ready for a cozy evening. Unlike traditional wood-burning fire pits, there’s no need to gather firewood or deal with ash cleanup. This convenience means more time spent enjoying the ambiance rather than preparing for it.

### Extended Outdoor Living Season

With a round fire pit table, you can extend your outdoor living season well into the colder months. The efficient propane heat warms up your space, making it inviting even on chilly nights. You can host gatherings, enjoy family dinners, or just unwind with a book outside, no matter the season. The glowing flame creates a cozy environment that draws people together.

### Multi-Functional Use

These innovative tables are not just for warmth; they serve multiple functions. Most round fire pit tables include a top that can be converted into a dining or coffee table when the fire is not in use. This functionality makes them an excellent investment, as you’re not just buying a fire feature, but also versatile outdoor furniture.

### Energy Efficient

Another benefit of using a round fire pit table with a hidden propane tank is its energy efficiency. Propane fires produce a consistent and controllable flame. You can adjust the temperature to suit your needs, which helps in conserving fuel. This efficiency means you can enjoy your fire pit without worrying about excessive propane usage.

### Simple Maintenance

- **Minimal Cleaning:** Unlike wood-burning pits, which require ash disposal and soot removal, propane fire pits require little maintenance.
- **Durable Materials:** Many fire pit tables are made from weather-resistant materials, ensuring they withstand outdoor elements.
- **Easy Repairs:** Should you face any issues, finding replacement parts for propane equipment is generally easy and straightforward.

Adding a round fire pit table with a hidden propane tank can transform your outdoor living space into a stylish and functional area. It enhances your home’s aesthetic while providing warmth, safety, and convenience. The ability to gather around a beautiful fire, free from the clutter of visible propane, makes these tables a worthwhile investment. Whether you're hosting a party, dining al fresco, or simply enjoying the sunset, a round fire pit table can create lasting memories for years to come.

Assess the area where you plan to place your fire pit table. It's important to strike a balance between having a table that's large enough for your needs but not so big that it overwhelms your space. Measure the available area, keeping in mind the following:

- **Diameter:** Round tables come in various sizes, typically ranging from 30 to 60 inches. Choose based on how many people you want to accommodate.
- **Height:** Standard height tables are around 28-30 inches. Make sure it's comfortable for eating and socializing.

- **Color:** Match the table color with other outdoor furniture for a cohesive look.
- **Finish:** A powder-coated finish can add extra protection against the elements.

1htbqki,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_seopreneur27/comments/1htbqki/my_first_reddit_meetup/,My first reddit meetup,"I just got back from my first Reddit meetup, and I had to share how amazing it was!

So, I joined this WhatsApp meetup group a little while ago, mostly to connect with people my age. At first, I didn’t expect much; just thought it would be one of those groups where everyone shares memes and random thoughts, but oh boy, was I wrong! The vibe was incredible. We got into some really deep convos about everything: careers, taxes, business, jobs, life hacks, and we even roasted each other in a fun, light-hearted way (the comedy energy was on point).

I missed out on the New Year meetup because of work (sadly), but I didn’t feel left out at all because we kept the conversation going on WhatsApp. Whether it was singing random songs (I’m terrible, but it’s the thought that counts, right?), or sharing poetry (we even have a shayar group), the group was just full of energy and creativity.

Fast forward to tomorrow - I finally made it to the meetup at a cafe shop in Chembur (Cafenately Coffee). And let me tell you, it was totally worth it! Met some amazing people from totally different backgrounds: hospitality, HR, photography, data science... you name it. We grabbed coffee, nibbled on some snacks, and just vibed together. The diversity of experiences was inspiring, and I genuinely had an amazing time just talking to people who, although strangers at first, felt like old friends.

Overall, this was a reminder of how cool it is to meet people beyond your regular circles. Reddit meetups are awesome, and I can’t wait for the next one!

1htbooa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DysfunctionalFamily/comments/1htbooa/my_sister_is_almost_short_with_finances_but/,"My sister is almost short with finances but always goes out and parties
","Background: I am a 21M and I lived at home with my mom, older sister \[28F\], & younger sister \[18F\] (latin background). My father used to be the breadwinner and brought in the income while my mom was a stay at home with me and my sisters. Due to some life circumstances he left the financial situation but not out of my life (not willingly but easiest way to say would be to say he moved out of the country) anymore. So that left my mom and my sisters & me to deal with the situation ourselves. That was around 5 years ago when that occured. Since then my mom ended working fulltime to be able to pay rent and support me and my siblings. We ended up moving to a new house some time later which we rented. 

To help my mom I picked up a fulltime job at 18 and then I ended up joining the military about a year ago and since then I pay the utilities at home even being away from home. While my older sister is in charge of 1/2 rent and one utility and my mom for the other 1/2 of rent. My younger sister goes to school and works a part time but isnt responsible for any bills/financials.

The Issue: My older sister is quite irresponsible with her money. Whenever it comes time to pay rent she somehow almost always comes in short somehow for her half of rent, her shared bank account is frequently overdrawn, her vehicle registration is months past due

The issue isnt necessarily that she is short from time to time I understand that life happens and thats why family is here to help eachother out. Its the fact that she almost always eats out at restaurants and never fails to buy coffee and other drinks out. Almost every weekend she goes out to either bars, clubs, concerts/raves, or just some social gathering at somewhere where you need to pay. Clearly I can see that shes spending money but when she needs to pay her share theres none to be found or always doenst have enough. 

The issue enlarges in that whenever I try to create a budget with her, create some form of financial plan, or just try to give advice about credit to help her out she always gets bothered by it or at least gives off the impression of it. She raises her voice at me to say that im bothering her and she always has an excuse of why she cant do it with me at that moment ( stress, tired, etc.) and postpones it every time I bring it up. 

I stress often as to what to do and worried about my mom just working to pay rent and have almost nothing for herself or to even save. My little sister sounds like she's following in my older sisters footsteps with how she talks and acts (sassy and rude every time I call or talk to either one of them). 

They say my mom is ""overbearing"" and ""too much"". I get it I know my mom and she can be in her moods at time but its to the point where they say that whenver my mom says basic things like to help clean the house or to even get them to clean their rooms. (Their rooms are almost always a mess. Mainly messy clothes and disorganized closets to the point where you cant even walk in but sometimes. But also sometimes like leaving old bowls with food residue laying around their room. 

What do I do? This has been ongoing for about 1-2 years. I really am at my wits end. Am I in the wrong for trying to help my older sis? Am I doing something wrong? I really just want everyone to succeed but I really dont know atp. Im trying my best.

I really dont know what to do. Any advice would be welcomed I really dont know what to do I feel like my hands are tied being so far from home and cant do more to help my mom and my family.
