I’m a 35-year-old guy looking to meet someone who enjoys meaningful conversations, exploring new ideas, and sharing experiences. I’m a white male of average height with short brown hair and green eyes. I’m working on losing a few pounds (aren't we all) and have been told I have a nice smile. 

Photo of me: https://imgur.com/a/CiQvQC0

I've met a few of you in the past and things fizzled out, so I'd like to give this another go to see if things can work this go around.

Here are some hot takes we can talk about:

* Relationships shouldn't feel like a chore. They should always feel fun, fresh, and exciting. It's up to both partners to communicate and keep thinks lively.
* Anime is my jam.  *Ghost in the Shell* is my all-time favorite. If you enjoy anime that makes you think, we’ll have plenty to discuss. If not, tell me why you hate animes.
* I enjoy spending time outside helps me clear my mind. Whether it’s walking, hiking, visiting nature parks, or just finding a quiet spot to unwind, I appreciate being in nature and exploring new places. Alternatively, why does nature suck?
* I like checking out new spots, whether it’s a coffee shop, a laid-back bar, or a local brewery. Explain to me why I should be a hermit.
* I respect people who know what they want and aren’t afraid to engage in meaningful discussions. Sometimes the truth is the hardest and it hurts the most. Explain to me why I shouldn't be a robot and hit everyone with truth bombs.


**Bonus Question:**
Nerds are son in. Yes or No?

If you'd like to give me your hot take, send me a message. If this sounds like fun, let’s talk about any of the above topics or about anime, philosophy, sports, nature, or anything else worth discussing.",1,1742832811.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1jiuhvd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jiuhvd,Lawn ID Help Please,"Hello all and I hope your coffee is tasty! We are just starting the first year at our new place and we had some vole trouble during winter. The problem has been taken care of with no signs of action for two months but I was wondering what would be the proper process to get the trails they made back to looking seamless. I would assume adding a type of soil to the gaps, seeding, and fertilizing the entire small lawn would be best . I am in Northern California in zone 9B. If someone could help me out with identification of the grass and/or what seed and fertilizer to buy I would greatly appreciate it. 

Next up, the backyard has sprouted major weeds recently and we were thinking of just spraying them with roundup or some other brand. For 1997 sqft would the standard Home Depot/costco ready to use hub be sufficient or should I purchase the sprayer and concentrate via online?

TIA to everyone and have a good day! The first small lawn is directed towards the seeding/fertilizer and the second set of pictures is the weeds in the backyard.",1,1742832785.0,lawncare,3,1.0,False

i just have a question. i don’t want reassurance, i just want an outsider’s perspective. 

i just started zoloft (25 mg) about a month ago. i drank a mcdonald’s frappe this morning with extra caramel. it was delicious, it’s one of my favorite drinks! anyway, it always makes me feel crappy. i assume because of the caffeine and sugar. 

i have class and a meeting in a couple hours, as well as hosting an interview in about 20 minutes. i still feel crappy. i have a zofran, but i’m hesitant to take it because 1.) i was very reliant on zofran november-january because my phobia got so bad, and 2.) i’m still so constipated from the zofran abuse that i’m not sure if taking one would be a good idea. 

i’m having some gas pains and constipation pains in my stomach, it moves around and doesn’t stay in one place. i also just know what those pains feel like since i’m so used to them. i need to use the bathroom, but can’t. i don’t exactly feel nauseous, but i don’t feel great either. it’s just now i always feel after having a coffee. 

i’ve been trying to sit with the nausea rather than freak out and go to safety behaviors. but like i said, i have a few things to do today. what do you guys think? how can i make myself more comfortable without taking the zofran? thanks in advance!",1,1742832785.0,emetophobiarecovery,1,1.0,False
1jiuhqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jiuhqg/a_vivid_dream_i_had_that_i_cant_forget/,A Vivid Dream I had that I can't Forget,"Have you ever had a dream you can't forget for a long time & you remember most of the details in the dream?  
I just want to share this dream I had 3 weeks ago. I can't forget it. It was a great, sweet, lovely, fun dream. One of the most vivid dreams I've ever had.  
That night, I was sick. I had a stomach ache. I was sleeping with a hot bottle of water wrapped in a towel to ease my stomach pain. Whilst I was sleeping, I had a dream about **this girl** with curly black hair. She's a theatre actress, not that famous, I think. She's been doing several stage plays & I watched one of her plays on West End (London) once. I didn't live anywhere near the West End or even London, for the record.  
The dream was in my POV. In the dream, my cousin came to my house with some people. One of them was this girl. Let's call her Z (not her initial). My cousin introduced me to the people who came with him, including Z.  
I said to Z, ""Wait. Are you an actress? I've seen you in a play!"" She was kind of cynical towards me & she said, ""Yeah, and?"" Then I said, ""Nothing. I just remember you.""  
She just shrugged me off. Then my cousin wanted me to take him & his group of people by car to a restaurant for lunch. So, I brought them to a Chinese restaurant. Very nice vibe. People, including Z, seemed to enjoy the meal, as I remember. I remember Z told me cynically, ""The food's alright."" So I asked my cousin, ""What's wrong with Z?"" & he said, ""That's how she is when meeting a new guy. Guarded."" I was like, ""What?""  
So I tried to break the ice by telling jokes (I forgot what jokes) to everyone & they laughed. At one of the jokes, I saw Z smirked & looked away like she was trying not to laugh.  
After lunch, I took them to an airport (I don't know why). On the way, I began to have a conversation with Z. We talked about things & we made jokes about each other. She wasn't cynical anymore toward me. At the airport, I told her, ""Can I come with you?"" She said, ""Are you mental?"" I said, ""I just wanna see London."" She said, ""Fine.""  
Somehow, I was on a plane sitting next to her. Then I remember I was in a bit of panic & told her, ""My phone! Where's my phone!? I think I forgot to bring my phone."" She grunted & told me, ""How the hell could you forget to bring your phone?""  
The plane landed in London. Z asked, ""Where are you gonna stay for the night?"" I said, ""I don't know."" She chuckled cynically, ""Oh, you're not staying at my place."" I said, ""Wait. I have another cousin who lives in London. I can stay there for a while."" (I do have a cousin living in London in real life). She asked, ""Alright, where does your cousin live?"" That I responded, ""Shit. I forgot the street name. But I know the area & the house."" She said, ""If only you didn't forget your phone."" & I said, ""Sorry.""  
**From this part, the colours of my dream changed.** **It was bright & vivid, orange-ish yellow. Kind of like Wes Anderson movies**.  
We walked around London to find my cousin's house. We walked around some Roman ruins in London. We passed by a building & she said to me, ""That's my flat right there. No, you can't come in."" I felt disappointed. We got lost in a cemetery. I saw a bunch of skulls there & she got scared. I told her, ""It's alright. Just some skulls."" Then I saw a cat. I was gonna give it a pet because I love cats, but turns out it was rabid. The cat hissed with saliva drooling from its mouth & then ran after us. I protected Z by throwing a stick at the cat. The stick hit the cat & we managed to get away. She was glad she could escape that cat & thanked me for protecting her from getting rabies. We joked around & had a laughing together after that. We went to a clothing shop because she wanted to buy some clothes. We took some mirror selfies in the shop whilst she tried out some dresses. On the way, we went to a cafe because she had to pee, then we sat at an outside table of the cafe, a round table of two with an umbrella. There, we had some coffee & talked about random things. I can't remember the details of this part, but I remember she was smiling & laughing. I remember the sunlight fell on her. She was shining beautifully. This is the image I remember the most.  
Suddenly, 3 men came by & she greeted them. Those men were her friends. Then Z introduced me to them. I said hi to them & I said, ""Do you know this house?"" They said, ""What house?"" I described to them what my cousin's house looked like. One of them said, ""I know that house. That's my friend's house!"" Then I said, ""Can you bring me to the house."" He said, ""Yeah, sure.""  
Then I looked at Z, ""Would you want to come along?"" Z said, ""Yeah. Let's go.""  
The man, however, told me, ""I can bring you there, but we have to run."" I asked, ""Why?"" No response, he just started to run. the 2 men who were with him also ran. Z too. She laughed & said, ""Come on! Run!"" I said, ""Guys, don't run too fast!""  
I remember I felt my heart pumping faster as if I was running. Then we stopped at a corner of a street. The man who told me to run said, ""Isn't that your cousin's house?"" I said, ""Yeah, that's it.""  
Then Z told me, ""This is it. I guess I'll go home now."" I asked, ""You're not coming?"" Z just smiled & shook her head. I felt sad, but she said, ""It was a great time. We'll meet again. Maybe.""  
Then I woke up. My stomach wasn't hurt anymore. Sorry for the long post. I need to let this out somehow.",1,1742832777.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1jiuexj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jiuexj,"Cycling from Alaska to Argentina: the Atacama Desert, Chile, Bolivian Altiplano, Salar de Uyuni","It took an entire week to complete the infamous Lagunas Route, a 300-mile [500 km] sandpit that snakes its way along the Atacama Desert dividing Chile and Bolivia. I pored over elevation maps each night in fearful apprehension, and by each morning the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist. Altiplanic dunes changing color by the hour. Stampedes of sand and unrelenting headwind. Nameless jeep tracks through the dust of rocky shrapnel. I kept thinking that the hardest parts were behind me, but they never stopped coming.
 
Over the Hill of Black Death at +16,100 ft [4,907 m]. Past the Salvador Dalí Desert. Past Laguna Colorada, then Laguna Blanca. When I finally hiked my bike into the Bolivian aduana [customs] exit office, I laid down on the floor in spent exhaustion. Their tiny outpost was the day’s sole escape from the wind which roared outside like a subsonic war horn, specters of emptiness in all directions.
 
From there I pushed through the remaining daylight hours to reach the Chilean border office in time, a small A-frame structure in the literal middle of nowhere. Immigrations officers cheered my approach, whistling with one fist in the air. Their green army fatigues were sharply pressed. Hair slicked back and cleanly shaven. I shared some dried apricots and they offered hot coffee, advising me to stay with them overnight because the sun was setting and it would be too dangerous to bike further. I rolled out my sleeping bag in the corner and curled up like a dog.
 
Most people head west from there towards San Pedro de Atacama. But I was too tired for more, not wanting to climb back up the notorious switchbacks en route. I turned left instead, another 75 miles atop dizzying lunar altitudes for Paso Jama, the only open border crossing.
 
More Mars-like desert. More lassos of wind. Extraterrestrial valleys with mineral lakes in odd pastels. Flamingos and flightless Rhea birds dotted the outskirts. I stopped often but not for photos, just to breathe, turning back at each barbed hilltop to watch the horizon wither in the distance.

So while the interest is there, I bought a moka pot as my own initiative so that we have a proper brewer that isn't too expensive yet could yield better results than just brewing it instantly with hot water direclty. My first trial was not so great. The coffee taste overly sour and bitter. After figuring out that you have to boil the moka pot slow, I tried it and it yields better results with the taste being not too bitter and way less sour, but it doesn't feel creamy and punchy like a proper esspreso my sibling could make with an aeropress. So I was wondering where did I go wrong. The coffee beans I used were 100% arabica, ground using an HL coffee grinder on the 2 setting (medium fine?) with a fairly medium to dark roast level. I boiled it slow and stopped immediately right before the water starts to gargle.

Long story (Content Warning included): 

I had a cup of coffee the other day at a brunch, and a friend commented she was glad I was one of \*those\* pregnant women who was ""super psycho about food"". Tbh, that was the first regular coffee I had had in 5 months. I had been avoiding caffeine in general, even if my OB told me it was fine in moderation. Been avoiding herbal tea too. So yeah, I'm one of \*those\* pregnant women I guess?

Last year I had a mc. I know most of them are just due to natural causes and I got told my multiple doctors not to blame myself... but it's hard to ""just relax"" in a rainbow pregnancy. This friend knows what happened. She's never been pregnant so maybe she just doesn't understand this dark side to rainbow pregnancies, so it isn't with her I'm annoyed, but let's say her comment was the last straw. 

At all family gatherings, whenever I reject something (even if it is because I can't eat anymore), someone will be nosey: ""Oh have just a little, it's fine!"" Girl you don't know if I had a ton of that yesterday and I have to balance it out today. You shouldn't care either way. Or ""I had a ton of this when I was pregnant, relax!"" Yeah telling people to relax has always worked. 

Despite my fears, I'm more of the ""fine in moderation"" type, but I do try to balance it out, so tbh I'm annoyed that people at gatherings want to boss over what I eat. They say ""just a little"" but they don't know it's the third gathering I've been in in the week or how much my job has allowed me to cook at home, maybe I feel like I've been eating like crap all week long. And either way I don't think it's their business. I'm just tired at how people can be when it comes to what women eat. Before pregnancy I was known to be a foodie and I was asked if I would ""really"" have that steak, that or that piece of cake. I'm healthy and in good shape, you'd think they'd let a healthy girl just have agency over her food but apparently that's problematic to some. 

Anyone else having this annoying scenario in their social life? ",2,1742832316.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False
1jiuami,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/1jiuami/road_tripping_in_the_bolt/,Road tripping in the Bolt,"Hi I’m new to Bolt ownership and wanted to share my experience road tripping with the Bolt on an 800 mile round trip. This trip was made possible by a lot of advice I’ve received on this Reddit. As such I want to share my experiences in the hope it may help others. 

We began our trip using A better route planner which is absolutely essential for long distance. We had range anxiety but overall ABRP really helped eliminate this anxiety. One part of the experience I want to share was to make sure you add additional charge time to a better route planners recommended charge level typically I added 10 percent. 
This is especially important if you must travel on mountain roads. Going up the mountain ABRP recommended we add 70 miles we added 35 additional miles for a total of 105 miles. We arrived at the next charger with about 15 miles until empty. So consider your drive and consider ABRP a guide and adjust accordingly for your elevation and weather. 

We had 4 stops along the route to visit points of interest. When possible we charged at our stops which wound up being 1 out of 4. At the other stops we found the destination chargers to be broken. These were evgo which I found so aggravating  requested to cancel my day old account. I’m reconsidering this position however based upon a discussion with another EV owner while charging on the way home. He indicated that although he has had similar experience he has also found locations with free charging that actually work. I’d be curious what others here have experienced with evgo. 

As much as I hate to support the Tesla group with the musk man. I have to admit we used some Tesla chargers and found that they afforded us the most consistent experience and were typically located at Sheetz and Wawa locations that were safe well lit and allowed us to grab a coffee bite to eat or use the restroom. The biggest thing with the Tesla chargers we found was the accuracy of their status. In one case 6 of 8 chargers were listed as in use and when we arrived we found 6 of 8 to be in use. In one instance 1 of 8 chargers was listed out of service and that was the condition we found at arrival. My suggestion would be to buy the Bolt with DC fast charging and the Tesla adapter. If you’re going to road these are a must. The adapter opens up more options for charging. in the cases where the evgo didn’t work we found a Tesla charger near by and were able to charge and get under way. 

One of the nice things about ABRP is the recommended charge at each station. As a newbie for some reason I had it in my head that I would always fully charge at each stop. Overall I found the partial charge to be most efficient and based on the planning I enjoyed the stops. I’m getting older and the opportunity to get out and stretch on these trips seems perfect. In my younger days I’d drive 8 hours and not even feel tired. These days 3 to 4 and I need a break. So perhaps the EV showed up in my life at just the right time. If you plan your travels around meal times you can easily grab a bite to eat and by the time you’re ready to go your car will be ready.

Seat comfort and storage space, we were easily able to fit everything we needed in the Bolt. We folded the back seats down and placed a large cooler, a medium sized suitcase and several gift boxes. As far as the seats I’ve found for local drives overall they are comfortable enough. However for this long trip I did find that some improvements will be necessary. I will be looking at some of the things people here have previously suggested.

If you’ve made it this far thanks for reading. I would also like to say thanks to all of you who have provided support to me during my journey to an EV",1,1742832300.0,BoltEV,0,1.0,False

Do you honestly believe members of this community got together and decided to orchestrate a smear campaign against the three of you?  If you honestly believe that, you aren’t ready to reenter the scene and you need to do much more reflection.  Its clear that you have some followers that actually believe there is some type of covert effort led by Patty and any comments you read from your supporters agreeing with the type of messages you delivered the last two days are not helping you.  I say that because you are getting positive reinforcement from people that likely don’t know the details and its just going to accelerate this collision course you are on – you need to take a good hard look at why you, KCL & TSP felt it necessary to remove your content.  I can tell you it was NOT because of a smear campaign and if you want to believe that, you will never recover from this.

I just watched the clip you played last night of Crime & Coffee.  I know it was part of a larger point you were making about an allegation you tried to shut down her channel.  What was lost in the context of the clip you played to your audience is that shortly prior to her video, you were fresh off a couple livestreams where you went on LONG rants and were being aggressively territorial about this being ‘your case’ and said a lot of negative things about other content creators.  Do you remember saying there are a lot of ‘Johnny-come-latelies’ appearing that are covering the case and a lot of ‘carnival barkers’ and ‘circus acts’ out there on YouTube that are covering the case and we shouldn’t be listening to them?  Do you remember saying we should ONLY be follow creators that have been on the scene for a while or are creating with unique spin and made ‘recommendations’ on the creators that, in your opinion, are trusted and ‘worth our time’.  I’m fairly certain you didn’t specifically call out Crime & Coffee as one of the ‘circus acts’ but it seemed VERY clear to me she was one of the channels you were referring to.  Do you remember your passive aggressive comments about Patty Wilson?  I’m sure you saved the recording, I’d implore you to take a relisten to some of your last livestreams before you disappeared – its very clear you were disparaging Patty and others and you deserved any and all backlash from the comments you made in those streams that you removed.  It’s that entitled attitude of yours that got several other content creators (and general case followers) worked up.  I’ll even take your word that the e-mail to Crime & Coffee from last night’s clip you played wasn’t you BUT her reaction was a build up and response to your livestream comments where you called out other creators.  If you feel someone erroneously accused you of bullying and trying to take down another creator in one isolated example, I understand you desire to defend yourself, but you are doing it on VERY weak footing based on many of your past comments about other creators.  You created a lot of tension amongst other creators in those livestreams shortly before things imploded.  There is also wide speculation by MANY here in this sub and in the DMJ sub that you are one or several of the moderators for the DMM subreddit.   Many in this sub have told stories of getting banned if they ever even remotely hinted at anything that might be viewed as negative towards you – yet disparaging comments about other creators were fair game – coincidence?  If true, how many people did you silence, and if true, really sad – love to hear you address this in your next ‘live’.

As far as your two friends that you seem to be trying to figure out a way of distancing yourself from, but haven't yet, there is a LONG list of things that they both did that are inexcusable and if you want to die on that hill defending them – go for it.  I’m not getting into to any of the detail here about those two and I’ll even agree that ‘some’ of the allegations might not be completely accurate or fair BUT there is enough (and PLENTY) that is 100% accurate and reprehensible behavior.  There were many clear acts of attempting to embarrass, harm (both financially and reputation) and create division amongst member of the ‘community’.  Do yourself a favor, revisit those livestreams I referenced above and try to listen objectively, perhaps then you will begin to understand why you have so many against you.

I stood frozen in the kitchen doorway that Tuesday morning, watching as Emily poured herself a cup of black coffee—no cream, no sugar. Exactly how I drink mine. Except Emily hated coffee. Had never touched it in the ten years we'd been married. Her hands moved with strange precision as she lifted the mug to her lips, her eyes locking onto mine over the rim as she took a slow, deliberate sip. A thin trail of dark liquid trickled down her chin, but she didn't wipe it away. Just kept staring. Smiling.

""Since when do you drink coffee?"" I asked, my voice sounding too loud in the heavy silence.

Her head tilted slightly to the left. Just a fraction too far. ""I felt like trying something new,"" she said. The words were right, but the cadence was wrong. Each syllable fell from her lips with unnatural precision, like someone had taught her how to speak but hadn't quite mastered human inflection.

That night, I woke to the sensation of being watched.

Moonlight streamed through the bedroom window, casting long shadows across the walls. Emily stood beside the bed, her face inches from mine. Her breath smelled faintly of copper and something earthy. Rotten. She wasn't blinking.

""Emily?"" My throat tightened around her name.

""You looked so peaceful,"" she whispered. Her fingers grazed my cheek, ice-cold against my skin. ""I wanted to watch you sleep.""

Her pupils were too large. Black pools that swallowed the moonlight whole. When she leaned closer, I saw it—the way her eyelids didn't quite close all the way when she blinked. A sliver of white always remained.

The changes accelerated.

I found her wedding ring in the garbage disposal, the metal twisted into an unrecognizable shape. When I confronted her, she ran her tongue over her teeth—slow, deliberate—before answering. ""It was bothering me,"" she said, rubbing her bare finger. The skin beneath was smooth. Unmarked. As if the ring had never been there at all.

Then came the nightmares.

I'd wake to the sound of wet, tearing noises from the kitchen. Three nights in a row, I found her hunched over the counter, her face buried in a package of raw meat. Blood smeared across her lips and chin as she turned to me, a chunk of glistening red flesh dangling from her fingers. ""Do you want some?"" she asked, her voice guttural. Almost hungry.

The worst part? Her teeth.

They were sharper.

Yesterday, I checked her phone.

The screen lit up with a gallery of photos—hundreds of them. All of me. Sleeping. Showering. Standing in the backyard with my back turned. The time stamps spanned weeks. Months. The most recent was taken five minutes prior.

A close-up of my face.

From inside the closet.

My blood turned to ice. Behind me, the closet door stood slightly ajar.

Last night, I finally snapped.

""Who the hell are you?"" I demanded, backing away as she stepped toward me. Her movements were too fluid. Too precise. Like a marionette learning how its strings worked.

She smiled. Too wide. Too many teeth. ""I'm your wife,"" she whispered, her voice layered with something else. Something beneath the words.

Then she was in front of me, her cold hands framing my face. Her breath smelled like old meat and damp soil. ""But you shouldn't have noticed,"" she murmured, her lips brushing my ear.

Somewhere in the house, a door creaked open.

I'm writing this from my car, the engine still running.

Through the living room window, I can see her. Standing perfectly still in the dark. The streetlights don't touch her. Don't cast a shadow.

In the other, my wedding ring.

**Episode Description:**

*What drives us to venture into the unknown despite the inherent uncertainty and risk that awaits?*

Our relationship with exploration—from pushing physical boundaries to seeking novelty in everyday life—reflects something preternaturally profound about the human condition.

My guest today is **Alex Hutchinson**, an award-winning journalist, Cambridge-trained physicist, and bestselling author whose work dives into the profound depths of human performance and our innate desire to explore.

His earlier book, [*Endure*](https://www.amazon.com/Endure-Curiously-Elastic-Limits-Performance/dp/0062499866/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.q6PxsKXq1SWT6xqiT0eAV_HbCJ_QGdPe1goRjgui-dibrT21TgPN1nOlMwPv1euKxGIhVh_72dnx-N5vKzrVMadG4o2YB2ihnP4YbkWY3mgH-80Q7UtI6_psaOJ_MduthXTrIpgMkQbCJk6jPG_1v-vqI7kamoI1eN4CNiVHweHFJi0y6nhio-Cc4ouKmij50fNYJw_USLsLOmw69uWUs7pcTnbE4Oz01eS1KYaHEU4.7U3LdZdclSm5HfAMSxO0Z2sRx1HGzyZOUHbUQoneGxc&qid=1742339440&sr=1-1), remains the definitive text on the science of human performance—a well-worn copy still rests on my coffee table—but his latest work goes beyond the physical to investigate the psychological, evolutionary, and neurological factors that motivate us to seek the unknown. Seven years after our initial discussion about the science of endurance, Alex returns with [*The Explorer’s Gene*](https://amzn.to/4bb2KDP), a captivating exploration of why we are drawn to the fringes of what we understand.

Today, we discuss:

But it wasn't just the fire...no...

Rats. It was their third wave of attack this week. They ran through the fire , careless of burning. Careless of each other. They were all driven mad. They were hungry. And the tree, the tree just gave them a cooked meal.

We were fighting. Trying. Trying to do something. Anything. But ultimately, we had to flee. While running away. I saw one of us.
Standing in the flames. Careless like the rodents.
He was standing tall above it all. As if the fire was beneath him. As if it didn't have any right to touch him. He was still fighting. Cutting them. Slicing them. Shooting them. But they were still coming. He didn't even look tired.

"" You know, I was going to beg you for some supplies. for mercy , for kindness. But now, now I think we're just going to take it.""

"" Off of my dead body ye bastard!""

"" Exactly...""

I pulled out my knife and rushed him. pulled and tugged at his legs and fell on top of him. Slashed his throat clean. I watched as life itself flew out of his body.
Tears were forming underneath his eyes.
The boy just bled out. And I just sat there and forcefully listened to his gurgles. He was inexperienced. I overreacted. Something took over me...it wasn't anger. Petty. Yes , I felt petty for him. For us.
Others joined inside. Looting everything they could get their grasp on. Eventually I got off of the dead boy still looking inside his eyes. Empty. Nothing behind them anymore. All because of me. Went outside crying. Because I know. I know that now, we are the rats...



"" Hey you ok?"" Shamus checked on me.

I didn't know what to respond with. Lost for words. What have I done?
What have I become?

"" Yeah , I'm fine.Get as much as possible. We don't have much time, we need to leave.""

"" Why didn't you just shoot the bastard?""

"" We'll need the ammo. And shooting him would have resulted in gathering unnecessary attention.""

"" What kind of an idiot leaves a boy in charge of an inn in the middle of nowhere...""

"" An idiot. C'mon hurry up.""

"" Hehe , you got it.""

I took out a match , and lit it.
Stared at it for a couple of seconds. Admired it.
Beautiful. So deadly, yet so delicate.
I miss home. I miss my wife. I miss seeing her every morning. A part of me really believed it this time. I keep lying to people again and again...
I'm so sick of it. Why? Do they even Care? No one buys it... everyone knows what I truly am...
A coward. I'm a fraud who got away. Didn't even try. To save them. To fight the rodents. To put out the massive flames. To save her...
If it weren't for these idiots, I'd be dead.
Been running with these Irish folk for a while now.
A lot of them have died either in pointless shootouts or they've died to the plague.
Ironically, that's what they call themselves. The plague.

 we deserve it...
Spreading havoc everywhere we go.
I've done a lot of things to prove that I'm worth keeping around. Proved my loyalty. It had its price. If she were to see me right now , she'd spit in my face and shoot me. Probably...
The fire was getting really close to my finger tips. I had to put it out. 
Protection is a hard thing to come by out in the wilds. Back in the village I never truly appreciated what I had. Not until I lost it.


"" C'mon boy, get your arse moving."" 

Nolan was our leader. Our visionary...
Can't lie , when I first met him I saw right through him. He hides his narcissism with his charisma. He has lost, a lot. Friends, family and foes alike. Rivals. Tons of rivals. Tons of enemies.
Enemies that won't give up until they would have his head. He means well for his people.
He truly does. Seen it with my own two eyes.
How much he cried when he lost the love of his life. How much sorrow he carried when he lost his right hand man. When he lost his brothers.
We have buried so many people in these parts.
The woods are filled with the ghosts of his people.
He keeps promising us. Over promising. A better future. Someplace where we can feel safe. Be free. Be happy. To do whatever we want. A fresh start. I'd love to believe him. But that's impossible. A place like that would be heaven and I've lost my faith.
Therefore, I don't really like him.

The only person among these fools I like is O'Connor. He has a brain. And most importantly, the kid has heart. I admire that about him.

"" Ye did good today. Keep it up.""

"" Thanks Nolan.""

"" You know when I first met ya , I wanted to shoot ye. There is no way In hell, I let a Scottish bastard join us...I said. But I'm glad I did. I'm starting to really like ya.""

"" Same here. Thank you.""

Bastard.


We rode away and camped in the woods.

We set our tents and sat by the fire, except for O'Connor. He was journaling as usual. 
I watched them feast on the food we took. I could barely eat. Each time I thought of it , the face of that boy would come to my mind.
I could hear screams. Faintly. Roars. Nolan got up and picked up his rifle, and without telling us anything he ran towards the screams. He didn't give us any time to react. His second in command by order, shamus ran after him. Soon after, me and O'Connor followed them.
Bang!. Bang!. Bang!.

The screams were getting worse and worse.
As if , Nolan ran out there not to  save the poor bastards, but to make their pain worse.

Heart pumping fast. Eventually we found him.
He was starstruck at the sight of what he had stumbled upon. A priest and his disciples, torn apart. And standing alongside their pieces... Was a beast.
 Blood gushing out of its mouth.
It's nails sharp and some were broken. It's fur darker than the night's sky...
With teeth the size of a finger , it attacked us.
I stood back and shot at it from afar.
It wasn't enough. It slashed and jumped. And eventually it stabbed its teeth into shamus. He screamed with fear. No matter how many hits it received , it was nothing!.
It brought shamus to his knees. As it tried to go for the second bite, I saw O'Connor jump on the beast's back and pierce through its fur with a cross. Made of silver.
It roared , of pain. O'Connor didn't stop. Stab after stab. The poor boy was getting soaked in its blood. Eventually it had enough. It took O'Connor by the collar of his shirt and threw him onto a nearby tree.
I found a crucifix on the ground next to the torn pages of the book of god.
Nolan grabbed Shamus and carried him away.
As away as he possibly could but the beast was much faster. It could outrun all of us normally and Nolan had shamus on his shoulder. He didn't let go of him. He could, to insure his own safety, but he didn't.
The look in his eyes wasn't of fear...but acceptance. He had tried. That's what mattered. I couldn't let them die. 
I didn't want to die a coward...
I emptied the rest of my ammo grabbing its attention. As it ran towards me , I could see her.
The life I had with her. The best time of my life.
Everything that I've done in life, good or bad...
Had let me here. In front of this magnificent creature. I squeezed the crucifix in my hand, hard. Its spit, making a river under its feet.
It opened its mouth and put its tongue out. Licking Its lips. I gazed into the eyes of my possible killer and saw a man. The eyes of a man. Just like that boy. They looked so innocent and pure. Pain. Agony. Torment.
It had gone through all of it.
Rotten blood under its nails. All of a sudden, it was ready to strike. Ready to take a bite of its dinner. I held the crucifix up. It went inside its mouth. The crucifix had a sharp edge underneath. I stabbed its mouth open.
It couldn't close it. The silver was driving it , driving him mad. It started to cry out like a lost pup. Limped on the ground, shaking aggressively.

"" PLEASE...KILL ME!!!""

He talked... Through the beast.

Begged for the sweet release. For mercy. For his curse to end.

Nolan walked up to him. Looking down on him. He felt bad. He took out his revolver and , shot him in the head. The silver had weakened him enough that the bullet went through. He was free. O'Connor went into a mad laugh. Laughing and then crying.

"" Why? WHY DID YOU RUN OFF? ANSWER ME!""

I yelled.

"" To scavenge..."" He replied.

Beaten and tired , we limped back to our tents.

"" Boy be careful please. Every piece of my hair hurts!."" Shamus let out in pain.

"" Don't worry let's get you patched up.""

O'Connor tended to Shamus's wounds.

He was burning with a horrible fever.

"" I meant to ask you of this land...is there any tale behind it?"" Nolan asked like a child in a classroom.

"" Ayy. There is.""

"" Would you mind telling it to me?""

"" Why do you care?""

"" I need to know what and why we are fighting...""

"" (Sigh) There are many reasons as to why things are the way they are...but  mostly, people tend to believe that we are suffering because of our sins. God showed us mercy but we were blind to it. And now, he's showing us his wrath to open our eyes.""

""People? Don't you believe it?""

""Not any more, no.""

"" So you're saying God cursed ye?""

"" You'll be hanged if you say that to a priest...
I believe so. God was never merciful. All this death over a pitiful grudge. it will pass...they said.""

"" You tend to not respect the lord...""

"" Respect? No for that I have plenty for him...
I don't worship him anymore. It never did any good for me.""

"" How long does it last?""

"" We are not even in the middle of it. Usually it will take half a year. But sometimes. Sometimes it will last a whole damn year.""

"" No , I meant the entirety of the curse...""

"" Like I said until we open our eyes to his mercy.""

"" You don't have to worry... I'll get us out. We'll leave.""

"" You crazy? We can't just leave the land. Once the plague starts, filth and beasts alike roam around the line that separates us. And even if we were to get passed them , where do we go?
The presbyteral counsil will come after us.""

"" We'll go somewhere, where no one can tell us what to do... The land of the free.""

"" You have truly lost your mind.""

"" I know a captain...he is a close friend of mine and he has been smuggling people out of the country for a while now... That will be our only chance.""

""I don't think if that's a good idea.""

"" Listen, I know it's a lot to ask of ye. Today you once again proven that you are family.
I need you to be alongside me.""

""I have no one else here. Nowhere else to be.
Whatever you decide is best for us. I'll follow. But , I'm not sure about this. It's very risky.""

"" More risky than being hunted by beasts?""

"" Ayy. The council of priests aren't exactly too forgiving on people who run from their punishment. They aren't... normal.""

"" You don't worry about them. We'll be alright. I promise you that. Sleep tight ey.""

"" Goodnight.""


I could hear shamus moan in pain all night.
I dreamt of her. Her beauty. Her body. I miss her. She went to the old tree to visit her grandmother one last time. The tree caught on fire. Can she have made it?

I took the crucifix with me. I slained a beast today. Who would have imagined. Would she be proud? Would she care? 
Yeah , I think she would have.

Sleep never came. Only thoughts did. All kinds of thoughts.
O'Connor was still awake. Sketching something. I got up and that startled him.

"" Can't sleep either ey?"" He said.

""Yeah. What're you doing?""

"" Drawing.""

"" Can I see?""

"" Sure.""

He was drawing a man. Smiling with teary eyes.
A man who was happy. To live. To exist. Something like that is fictional now.

"" It's the man, he was. Before he lost his humanity.""

"" It's beautiful. Great work.""

"" I thought maybe, in this way I can pay a little tribute.""

I nodded 

"" I didn't take you for a religious figure."" I said while sitting by the fire making some coffee.

"" I'm not, the cross was my father's.""

"" I'm sorry for your loss. He raised a good son.""

"" Don't be, but thanks. He was nothing but a drunken bastard.""

"" If you ever wanted to talk about it. I'll listen.""

""  thank you.""

"" Then why do you carry around his cross?""

"" A trophy. It was him or me mom.
The bastard's cross finally had a use tonight.""

"" I guess we all have skeletons in our closets then.""

""Ayy.""

"" How did you end up here anyways?""

"" Our local priest, Crazy fecker. He called my mom a witch. Put a trial for her and everything.
They forced me to attend. To...
They gave me torches. The look of betrayal and despair in her eyes...I couldn't bring myself to...
I...ran away. there were searching parties for me. They called me a heretic. I embarked on a ship one night. I probably had to much to drink.
Didn't know it was going to sail here. There I found Nolan. He is the brightest person I've ever met. He hid me from them. He kept me safe. And all I had to do in return, was to accompany him. And here we are...""


"" I'm so sorry. I don't know what the future holds for us...but whatever it is , I hope we can make it out."" I responded.

I passed him a cup of coffee. We sipped and chatted a little bit longer and before we knew it, it was dawn. The horrible noises didn't stop.
After some while , it will become normal. Like birds singing. I hated that. The normality of it.

Shamus had stopped moaning. Probably passed out due to intense pain.

I heard a familiar noise. Not that far from us. A noise that destroyed my village. Squeaks. They were here.
I woke Nolan. Told him about our situation and what will happen if we don't leave immediately.
We packed fast. And rode away. Shamus and I rode together. He could barely sit still. His eyes kept on shutting. He looked really pale.

"" We need to bring him to a doctor!"" I shouted 

""We can't, the moment we step foot into a town they'll kill us."" Nolan explained 

"" What do we do then?""

"" Just follow me! I know a place we can go.""

We rode fast. Their squeaks were fading. For once we were faster. After hours of being on horseback we eventually reached the line.
 The beach.
Weirdly enough , there were no beasts. Or filth. Was it all lies? Lies to keep us here? Why?
 What would they gain from keeping us and slowly killing us?
It was beautiful.
Peaceful.


"" There he is!"" Nolan yelled and pointed to a sailboat on the shore.

"" Did you plan this out? Or is this just dumb luck?""

"" Love to say it's luck, but no. I've been writing letters to the captain for a month now...
I told you, don't worry. We made it!""

We didn't have anytime to celebrate...
Shamus fell from my horse. He fell on the sand convulsing. Spit coming out of his mouth and then blood. His bones were all breaking...

"" HE IS TURNING!!!""

Nolan took out his revolver and shot his former comrade with remorse in his eyes. It was too late. To no effect.

Shamus's mouth turned inside out! His skin was getting covered in fur! His limbs were growing! His nails growing to a size of an infant longer than the beast prior. clothes tearing. Screeches turned into Roars. Tears leaving his eyes. The last essence of humanity left him.
He was now , a monster. It attacked us with a different kind of force.


"" DON'T LET HIM BITE YOU!"" I yelled.

"" ATTACK IT WITH SILVER!""
Someone aboard the ship shouted.

The crucifix...It wasn't with me... In the panic of the rats attacking, I'd forgotten the crucifix...
O'Connor still had the cross.

It roared an ear piercing noise. It brought me to my knees. O'Connor had dropped the cross in the sand. Our ears were bleeding. I slowly crawled my way towards the silver.
It was hopeless.

Eventually it stopped. I got up holding the cross like a believer. It looked at us with curiosity. Breathing loudly. As if breathing was painful for it.

"" You bastard killed shamus!"" Nolan said.

I realized there was no way we were all going to make it...

"" Take O'Connor and run for the boat! I'll buy you time."" Said by the coward.

"" It will tear you apart! What are you talking about?""

"" I'm dead anyways. I'm inflicted with the plague ."" I lied "" Please go. Don't make it be for nothing...""

"" We can fight together I won't leave you!""

"" You must  save the kid!""

The beast was done pandering... It was getting hungry.

Nolan took O'Connor and ran for it and yelled for the captain to start sailing.

The beast wanted them. I shot at it. Again and again. Made it really angry. 
They got onboard.

Now it was me and the remainder of Shamus left. 
Once again I saw her. But this time...it wasn't just her , my newly established comrades were there as well. The day they found me shivering in a cave. Offering me a helping hand instead of robbing and killing me. Once again I didn't know what I had until I lost it.
It attacked with anger and fear in its core.
Its warm comfortable fur tossed me in the water like I was nothing. It got on top of me. I was prepared to see her. But without even knowing it I had impaled the beast with his cross.
O'Connor Mccaghy had saved me once again.
Just like the time he held my hand in the cave.
But it wasn't enough. It was crying. Like a child.
Its tears caressed my face. 
Tears turned into blood. Before I knew it. The beast's head was sliced open by a battle axe.
Standing behind it , was her grandfather .
The man who stood in the fire above it all. The definition of courage.

"" Been looking for you everywhere son! 
You're a hard man to find..."" 
He laughed with a nasty cough.

I watched as my comrades sailed away.

Hope you enjoy!  

# Chicago Athletic Association - January

This was my second time staying here I believe.  Love a lot about this place.  The location is great, the hotel itself is nice enough (it's old, but charming and updated enough), and there's lots to do within the hotel itself.  A speakeasy, tabletop games, a bar, a restaurant – you could really spend a night without leaving the hotel itself and not get bored.

# Andaz Mexico City - February

You can't beat the location of this place in Condesa, and the hotel overall is really nice, but we didn't love this place.  At this point, I still was not Globalist, so the standard room we booked was all we got, which is fine, but it left some to be desired.

The room felt small, and the bed even smaller.  It's advertised as a king, but it's definitely smaller and much shorter than even a standard queen.  The building was repurposed into a hotel from I believe an old office, so there are these giant columns in most rooms that look awkward.  Also, depending on where you stay, you can hear the rooftop's loud music until around midnight, which is super annoying.  Would like to stay here again in a suite and see if things are a little different.  Definitely prefer this location over the Hyatt Regency in Polanco.

# Hyatt Regency Mexico City (Polanco) - February

This was definitely more our pace in CDMX.  While I much prefer the Condesa neighborhood to Polanco, where the Hyatt Regency is, it's still a fine neighborhood for walking around, restaurants, etc.  There just aren't as many and it's definitely more uppity.  Thankfully CDMX is super walkable and has a great metro system and plentiful Uber/taxis, so it being based in Polanco shouldn't give you that much pause if you're more into Roma Norte/Condesa.

The hotel is great, though.  I love the club here (we used a club access award), which has great city views.  

I'm actually staying here right now as I write this in February 2025. I got upgraded to an insane three-room executive suite. It's definitely my favorite hotel in Mexico City.

# Grand Hyatt Hong Kong - March

One of my favorite Grand Hyatts, and really the epitome of the Grand Hyatt brand if you ask me.  Fantastic staff, lobby, and rooms.  The Grand Club is not only grand but features a fantastic view of Victoria Harbor with great food in the evening and a solid breakfast.

In my opinion, the staff, especially in the Grand Club, are what really set this place apart.  Time in the club really feels like you're being waited on in a high-end restaurant.  You won't need to do anything but drink $600 bottles of Ruinart champagne and enjoy the views of the harbor.  We used a club access award, which was well, well worth it after spending time in the club.

# Park Hyatt Saigon - March

We had a good room on the top floor (I think the 5th?) which was great.  Only gripe, and this isn't so much the hotel's fault as the southern Vietnamese heat, but the room never really got as cold as we would have liked.  The AC couldn't really push past 21.5C even with blinds closed or at night due to being on the top floor in late March.

I booked this through the Amex FHR program, so despite not being Globalist yet we got Globalist benefits.

The breakfast here is absolutely amazing.  Like incredible.  I love Vietnamese and they have everything you could want from the buffet, but also tons of noodle dishes and bahn mi you can order – not to mention fantastic Vietnamese iced coffee and fruit.  Really stunning.

# Park Hyatt Siem Reap - April

Maybe one of the more unknown Park Hyatts.  PH Siem Reap is right in the heart of Siem Reap and is a quick tuk tuk or taxi ride away from the reason anyone goes to Siem Reap, Angkor Wat.  Rooms were amazing, food was amazing, and the property features 2 pools, one being saltwater, which is much appreciated after spending all day walking around Angkor Wat in the heat and humidity.

The cash rates here were super manageable so we just paid instead of points, I think around $150 a night which is a steal for how nice this place is.  We paid for breakfast, which was fine but nothing spectacular.  There's a large grocery store cattycorner to the property for stocking up on drinks/snacks before venturing over to Angkor Wat.

The property itself is also very Cambodian and really captures the Park Hyatt essence of luxury meeting the local culture.  Truly great.

# Hyatt Regency Naha - April

We stayed here on a whim after the earthquake in Hualien, Taipei a week before we planned to visit (we got so lucky, we were going to be out in Taroko Gorge literally 7 days to the day after the quake happened).

Nonetheless, the Regency was a great place to stay with a great room, club lounge, and overall experience and location.  Most of what you'll want to do in Naha is walkable from the Regency and what's not is just a short taxi or transit ride away.  Can't imagine wanting to stay anywhere else for a few days in Naha.

This is also the stay where I hit 20 days in 3 months and completed the corporate challenge for Globalist until February 2026 – big milestone and lots of upgrades to come for the year.

# Grand Hyatt Taipei - April

First stay as Globalist and upgraded to the ""studio"" which is like a junior suite, and is very nice.

Located right next to Taipei 101, my favorite building in the world.  Taipei is not as big as most of its Asian counterparts, so getting around via taxi, public transit, or even biking via the city's bike share program, Ubike, is easy.  The Grand Hyatt is on the Southwest side of the city near the Red Line and Elephant Mountain.

The hotel does feature a club, which can have great views of Taipei 101 depending on where you sit.  Breakfast is available in the club (which is very mid) or at the very large restaurant on the bottom floor featuring a fantastic buffet.  Really like this hotel and it's a great value for points as well.

# Hyatt Regency Seattle - June

We stayed here for a long weekend trip to Seattle.  Hotel itself is great in a good spot in downtown Seattle.  Club is nice and big and a great place to get some work done if you need to.  Walkable to Pike's Place and the waterfront.  Thought the Regency was great but would love to try the Grand Hyatt Seattle next time.

# Hyatt Place Frankfurt Airport - June

Just stayed here for a night after a connecting flight into FRA.  Hotel is fine, nothing special.  Near a train station so easy to get to from the actual airport.  Fine place to sleep in Frankfurt for 5k points a night.

# Park Hyatt Buenos Aires (Palacio Duhau) - July

Absolutely beautiful property.  Park Hyatt Buenos Aires features 2 buildings, the ""palace"" which is where you'll more than likely check-in (and is unfortunately not bookable with points), and the ""other"" building, which is still fantastic but more modern.  Breakfast can be had in the palace or ""other"" building, featuring similar menus but a small buffet in the ""other"" building.

A lot of history here at Palacio Duhau, president Obama has stayed here, among other super important people over the years.  We used a suite upgrade award and the suite was a huge studio with tons of room overlooking the garden in between the 2 buildings.

The property is located in the Recoleta neighborhood of BA, considered a bit ""uppity"", but still close to a lof the city's attractions, especially by bike.  

# Hyatt Centric Santiago - August

We stayed here just one night.  Location in Santiago is good, being a Centric, and overall was very nice.  We were upgraded to the top floor with an amazing balcony as Globalist – although, the gym is directly above the top room floor and from 6AM-11PM you can hear people dropping weights.  Major oversight on the hotel's design, unfortunately.  There's actually a nice breakfast too, and I was greeted by name by the manager at breakfast – always a little awkward but a nice touch.  Despite the gym proximity, great place in Santiago for 5k points a night – just don't stay on the top floor.

# Hyatt Centric Downtown Portland - August

We split a trip to Portland staying here and at the Hoxton.  The Hyatt Centric was a much better hotel in a great location in downtown Portland.  Rooms were fine, the breakfast was good, and the hotel was overall worth the points.  Unless you've come to Portland for luxury, I think the Centric is about as good of value as you can get.

# Hyatt Regency Yokohama - September

Really loved this hotel.  I think it's fairly new as well?  Great location in central Yokohama.  Walking distance to Chinatown and Yokohama stadium, as well as a train station making it easy to get to with luggage from Tokyo.

No upgrades as Globalist (maybe a higher room?), but breakfast and the club lounge were great.  Room was fantastic as well with great views of Mt. Fuji.  Definitely one of the best Regencies I've stayed at.

# Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur - September

Definitely lives up to the Grand Hyatt name.  Big fan of this hotel.  It's in the ""luxury"" district of KL, which is fine.  You'll mostly be taxiing or walking other places, but you get great views of the Petronas Twin Towers from the club or breakfast area.  The breakfast was absolutely fantastic.  All sorts of global cuisines and they had a teh tarik station which was my first time trying Malaysian milk tea.

No upgrades as Globalist, but the hotel seemed to be super busy with some sort of event.  Overall, great hotel and super affordable (as is a lot of KL).

# Andaz Singapore - October

I've grown to truly love Grand Hyatts and the overall feel of them, so I initially was eyeing to stay at the Grand Hyatt in Singapore.  I decided on the Andaz after seeing that the Grand Hyatt was located on Orchard Street, which is really just opulence and shopping malls, no culture at all IMO.

I'm super glad I decided to stay at the Andaz Singapore.  The location for exploring the city is fantastic, and it's just adjacent to the arab quarter and much closer to the majority of Singapore's attractions and hawker centers.

No upgrade as a Globalist, but another fantastic breakfast, although not quite as large of a spread as the Grand Hyatt KL where I had stayed prior.  I think this was my favorite hotel of my fall trip to Asia, and maybe my overall favorite of the year.

# Grand Hyatt Dubai - November

I only stayed here for one night before a flight to Muscat, Oman.  I was extremely jetlagged and mostly just slept during my time in Dubai.  Having said that, the hotel and room were great.  Can't say much about the location as I didn't leave.  Was upgraded to a huge, 2-bed suite as a Globalist which was unnecessary for one night but fun.  Breakfast was fantastic and had tons of options as well.

# Grand Hyatt Muscat - November

I absolutely loved this place.  Initially, I was unsure.  It's old.  It's not really ""Grand"" by Hyatt's standards, the pool area was closed, and the rooms are honestly super dated.  But after staying here a few days I just fell in love.  It has so much Middle Eastern charm and something about the vibe is just super pleasant.  You can tell this place was the absolute shit 25 years ago.

I was upgraded to a suite, which was nice, but again, dated and with a huge bedroom with a ton of open space which was a little weird.  The hotel felt a little empty when I was there so as a Globalist I was a little surprised I didn't get upgraded to a premium suite, but who knows.  Could have just been a housekeeping thing.

The club was a nice reprieve at night after driving around and being in the hot Omani sun all day, as has a nice outdoor seating section.

Again, most Grand Hyatts have that massive, luxury hotel vibe with often 30+ floors.  Grand Hyatt Muscat is I think 5 floors?  But still with a large footprint and plenty of rooms.  I think with some much-needed updates this could really be branded as a Park Hyatt.  It's very, very Omani with lots of gulf-esque touches that really make it charming.

Think I will do a full write-up on this place soon.

# Grand Hyatt Amman - November

Another fantastic Hyatt property in the Middle East.  This Grand Hyatt is more ""typical"" of a Grand Hyatt you may find in most places.

Upgraded to a very large suite on the top floor as Globalist with a bottle of Jordanian wine gifted which was very nice.  Breakfast was good, but really nothing spectacular.

Location was good and I was able to walk to most places around Amman I wanted to see, with some taxi rides thrown in here and there.  Super solid.

# Andaz Vienna - December

The hotel is really well done for the most part.  We wanted to stay at the Park Hyatt, but couldn't justify the 35k points a night when the Andaz was 15k.  We were here for 5 nights and used a suite upgrade award which was well worth it.  The room was very nice with great views of Vienna's main station, but we both agreed the bed and pillows sucked, unfortunately.

The location isn't the best per se, but it's good and is right next to Vienna's main station, which makes it easy to get to.  Of course, being in Vienna there's lot of public transit near by, so it's still easy to get around the city quickly.

# Parisi Udvar Budapest - December

This was our last Hyatt stay in 2024 and it was a good one.  We were upgraded to a suite that had a fantastic view overlooking Budapest.  The bathroom windows open fully and grab the attention of everyone outside as soon as you open them.  The suites here are just really great.  Breakfast is on point, too.

This hotel is really beautiful, and I didn't realize how much of a tourist attraction it was in itself.  Lots of people in and out throughout the day just taking pictures inside and out.  I caught myself taking a picture or video of the interior almost every time we walked back inside.

With the stock burrs i found the sweet spot for espresso was around 6-8 where i was  getting nice shots that would take around 40 seconds to extract with my Flair 58.

Since i replaced with the Lebrew burrs though i have to go all the way down 1 to get a shot that is similar. Anything higher and the extraction is much too fast and the shots end up super sour.

  
I'm not sure if its something i have done wrong. The zero point is bang on, it didnt change at all after changing the burrs which i was surprised at. 

I have tried doing the marker test but again i'm not sure if its me or not but the marker doesnt seem to wipe off at all. The burrs are very dark though so its hard to get a marker to clearly show.

I'm not trying to be dramatic; I've had this Mokapot for 2 months now, a Grosche, I've gone through every tip/trick in the book.  I've experimented with grind sizes, different types of water, all sorts of experimentation with boiling the water on the side, pre-heating the base, etc...  If you've seen a video on YT or posted in here, I've tried it.  I could never get a good brew until today, 10 mins after watching this video.  

[https://youtube.com/watch?v=4yGinq5NaCA&si=zFO1Ta4CMLWtqcXs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4yGinq5NaCA&si=zFO1Ta4CMLWtqcXs)

  
What this video addresses is an exact issue I've seen mentioned here multiple times and I've seen the misleading solution of ""Tighten the Mokapot more"" posted way more times than really should be.  I don't fault the posters because you aren't exactly wrong, the issue is related to sealing between the chambers.  

My issue with ""tighten more"" is that all of these Mokapots have rubber gaskets and are designed to be taken apart and back together.  I'm an engineer ... and a powerlifter, if something has a rubber gasket or some kind of seal and is designed for multiple cycles, you should not be over-tightening these joints/intersections.  You are destroying the seal, requiring more tightening each cycle.  ""Snug"" is the industry standard for 90% of these types of seals.  You should tighten to the point where the pot does not easily tighten and it does not easily loosen.  If you are taking a metal power stance to tighten your Mokapot, just go onto your manufacturers website and buy a new rubber seal/gasket kit, because it's already destroyed.  Why does my powerlifting matter, it's to let you know that I can tighten my Mokapot more than you can, and that it does not solve the issue of steam escape/sputtering/slow flow.

So here is the big tl:dr; If you are having a lot of bubbling, steam escaping from the spout without flow, very slow flow, should take less than a minute to empty the chamber, I have a 2-3 cup Moka, it's fast; if the brew process is taking minutes, this is likely the issue.

What to look for: The biggest indicator is with everything together and on boil, you'll be losing steam through the spout on top with no coffee.  Often this will occur for minutes before the coffee ever starts.  Coffee will sputter, slow flow, etc...  Post coffee, the slide in grind bucket will seem somewhat dry.

What's happening:  Boiling creates steam, that pressure should build in the lower chamber, and force water through the tube at the bottom of the coffee grind bucket.  If that bucket doesn't have a tight fit against the main bottom chamber, steam will escape around the bucket and never force proper water water flow through the grounds.  The rubber gasket should help with keeping that gap between the bucket and bottom chamber, but if there is play there its going to leak steam and the rubber gasket/seal may not be enough, or even designed to stop that leak.  This is why you get sputtering, steam escaping before liquid, etc...  It's lack of backpressure.  

How to test: Watch the video, or if you like reading.  Fill your base with water and start boiling, place the grinds basket in without coffee in it.  When boiling and holding the grinds basket down with some object (it will float a bit on the steam), water should seep into the basket with no steam escaping around the side.  If this isn't happening...  

Solution: PTFE (Teflon) tape.  I bought a high PSI one, rated at 1200 and wrapped it under the lip on the outside edge of the grinds basket.  Run the boiling water test again and you'll notice an immediate marked difference with water flow into the basket if the issue is solved.",2,1742831342.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False
1jitvh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeautyCircle/comments/1jitvh8/add_a_pop_of_color_to_your_routine_with/,Add a Pop of Color to Your Routine with Multi-Colored Makeup Sponges,"I'll never forget the day I discovered multi-colored makeup sponges. There I was, rushing through Target at 9 PM on a Thursday (as one does), when I spotted this pack of vibrant, rainbow-hued makeup blenders that practically screamed ""BUY ME!"" from the shelf. I'd been using the same boring black makeup sponge for years, and honestly? It was getting pretty gross despite my best cleaning efforts. So on a whim, I tossed the colorful pack in my cart alongside the toothpaste I actually came for.

Little did I know that impulse buy would completely change my makeup routine for the better!

# Why Multi-Colored Makeup Sponges Changed My Beauty Game

Let me start by admitting something embarrassing. Before my colorful sponge revelation, I was that person who used the same makeup sponge for... well, let's just say way too long. I'd convince myself it was fine because I cleaned it regularly (ish), but deep down I knew better.

The biggest game-changer with multi-colored makeup sponges? I can actually keep track of when I'm using them! Having different colors has helped me implement a proper rotation system, which is so much more hygienic. No more ""is this sponge three weeks or three months old?"" dilemmas.

But that's just the beginning of why these vibrant little tools have earned a permanent spot in my makeup bag.

# A Color for Every Product and Purpose

One of the coolest things about having multi-colored makeup sponges is that I can assign specific colors to specific products or steps in my routine. For example:

* Pink sponge = foundation
* Blue sponge = concealer
* Yellow sponge = cream contour
* Green sponge = liquid highlighter

This color-coding system has honestly streamlined my morning routine in ways I never expected. There's something so satisfying about grabbing exactly the right tool without having to think about it, especially before my morning coffee has kicked in.

Plus, using separate sponges for different products means the colors stay true. No more foundation-tinted highlighter because I used the same sponge for everything! My blue concealer sponge never touches my bronzer, so my under-eye brightening actually stays bright.

# Tracking Usage and Replacement

Here's where I've gotten slightly obsessive (in the best way). I now use a different colored sponge each day of the week. Monday is pink, Tuesday is purple... you get the idea. This way, I know exactly how often I'm using each sponge and can replace them on a proper schedule.

Beauty experts recommend replacing makeup sponges every 1-3 months depending on usage, but let's be real — who actually keeps track of that? With my color system, I know exactly when it's time for a fresh batch.

I used to feel guilty about tossing sponges, thinking it was wasteful, but now I realize using clean tools is an important part of skin health. Those old, bacteria-laden sponges were probably contributing to breakouts I blamed on stress or hormones!

# Benefits Beyond Organization

The awesome organizational perks of multi-colored makeup sponges are just the beginning. There are so many other reasons to make the switch from basic beauty blenders to a more vibrant collection.

# They Make Makeup More Fun

I don't know about you, but getting ready in the morning isn't always a party. Some days I'm just going through the motions, especially for everyday work makeup. But there's something undeniably cheerful about reaching for a bright yellow or electric blue sponge that makes the whole process more enjoyable.

It's like how using fancy dishes somehow makes dinner taste better, even when it's just leftovers. My colorful tools add a little spark of joy to my routine that plain black or beige sponges never did. And honestly, anything that makes me smile before 8 AM is worth its weight in gold.

# Perfect for Traveling and Roommates

If you've ever traveled with a friend or lived with roommates who are also into makeup, you know the struggle of keeping track of whose beauty tools are whose. Multi-colored makeup sponges solve this problem instantly.

Last summer, I went on a girls' trip to Miami with three friends, and we all brought our makeup sponge collections. Instead of the usual ""Wait, is this mine or yours?"" confusion, we each claimed different colors for the weekend. Problem solved!

The same principle applies to roommate living. My sister and I share a bathroom, and there's zero confusion about which sponges belong to whom. She uses the pastel collection, and I stick with the vibrant jewel tones.

# Different Shapes for Different Needs

Another fantastic thing about most multi-colored makeup sponge sets is that they often come in varying shapes and sizes. In my collection, I have everything from traditional teardrop shapes to mini round ones perfect for concealer, and even some with flat edges that work beautifully for baking under the eyes.

Having these different shapes available has actually improved my makeup application technique. I've discovered that the pointed tip of the teardrop shape works perfectly for reaching the inner corners of my eyes, while the rounded bottom gives an airbrushed finish to my foundation that fingers or brushes just can't achieve.

The mini sponges that come in some sets are also amazing for applying eyeshadow primer or concealing small blemishes with pinpoint precision. Once you start using the right shape for each task, there's no going back!

# How to Get the Most from Your Multi-Colored Makeup Sponges

So you're sold on the idea and ready to bring some color into your beauty routine? Awesome! Here are some tips I've learned through trial and error to help you get the most from your multi-colored makeup sponges.

# The Wet vs. Dry Debate: What I've Learned

If you're new to makeup sponges in general, you might not know that there's an ongoing debate about whether to use them wet or dry. After experimenting with both methods, I'm firmly in the ""wet them first"" camp, and here's why:

When you dampen your makeup sponge before use, it swells slightly and creates a softer, more bouncy texture. This results in a more natural, airbrushed finish rather than heavy coverage. The moisture also prevents the sponge from absorbing too much of your expensive foundation!

Here's my fail-proof method:

1. Run the sponge under water until it's completely saturated
2. Squeeze out ALL the excess water (it should be damp, not dripping)
3. Bounce it against a clean towel a few times to remove any remaining droplets
4. Apply your makeup using a bouncing/stippling motion, not wiping

The difference between using a properly dampened sponge versus a dry one is seriously night and day. My foundation looks like skin rather than like makeup sitting on top of my skin.

# Cleaning Routine That Actually Works

Confession: I used to be terrible about cleaning my makeup sponges. I'd run them under water, maybe add a drop of soap if I was feeling fancy, and call it a day. Then I'd wonder why my sponges never seemed truly clean. Facepalm.

After some research and experimentation, I've finally found a cleaning routine that actually works:

1. Wet the sponge completely
2. Apply a small amount of gentle soap directly to the stained areas (I use baby shampoo or Dawn dish soap)
3. Gently work the soap into the sponge with your fingertips, focusing on stained areas
4. Rinse thoroughly until the water runs clear
5. Squeeze out excess water and let air dry completely in a well-ventilated area (not in your humid bathroom!)

I try to clean my sponges at least twice a week, usually on Wednesdays and Sundays. This frequency keeps bacteria at bay and extends the life of the sponges.

Pro tip: For a deeper clean once a week, I microwave my damp soapy sponges for about 30 seconds. The heat helps kill bacteria and break down makeup residue. Just make sure they're completely wet before microwaving (dry sponges + microwave = disaster), and be careful when taking them out as they'll be hot!

[**Check out this amazing set of multi-colored makeup sponges on Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZYKFNLK?tag=beauty04a2-20)

# Storage Solutions That Prevent Mold

Here's something they don't tell you in the makeup sponge manual (is there even a manual?): proper storage is crucial for preventing mold and bacterial growth.

When I first started using makeup sponges, I made the rookie mistake of tossing them into my closed makeup bag while they were still damp. Big mistake. Huge. I quickly learned that trapped moisture + darkness = perfect conditions for unwanted fuzzy green visitors.

Now I use a simple egg crate-style holder that allows airflow around each sponge. You can find these specifically designed for makeup sponges online, but an actual egg container works in a pinch! The important thing is that your sponges can fully dry between uses.

If you're traveling, try to bring a small mesh bag that will allow air circulation rather than sealing damp sponges in a plastic bag or case. Trust me, opening your makeup bag to find moldy sponges while on vacation is not the vibe.

# Quality Matters: What to Look For

Not all multi-colored makeup sponges are created equal. When I first jumped on the colorful sponge bandwagon, I bought the cheapest pack I could find and was disappointed when they started falling apart after just a couple of uses.

Since then, I've tried numerous brands and have figured out what to look for in terms of quality.

# Texture and Density Differences

The ideal makeup sponge should be soft but not too soft. If it feels like a marshmallow, it's probably too porous and will soak up too much product. On the flip side, if it feels like a stress ball, it's too dense and won't blend your makeup properly.

Look for sponges with a bit of resistance when you squeeze them. They should bounce back immediately when you release the pressure. This elasticity is what gives you that perfect airbrushed finish.

In terms of texture, slight variations can actually be beneficial for different products. A slightly more porous sponge works well for liquid foundation, while a denser one is perfect for cream products like contour or blush.

# Are Expensive Brands Worth It?

The million-dollar question (or maybe the twenty-dollar question): are those fancy name-brand makeup sponges actually worth the higher price tag?

After trying everything from the original Beauty Blender ($20) to dollar store versions, I've landed somewhere in the middle. The ultra-cheap ones tend to fall apart quickly and don't blend as well, making them actually less economical in the long run.

However, I've found that mid-range options (around $10-15 for a set of 5-10) often perform just as well as the expensive single sponges. Look for brands with good reviews that specifically mention durability and how well they wash.

My current favorite set cost about $12 for 5 sponges, and they've lasted me nearly three months with regular cleaning. That's a much better value than replacing a single $20 sponge every month!

# Creative Ways to Use Multi-Colored Makeup Sponges

Beyond the basic foundation application, there are so many creative ways to use your collection of colorful sponges. Here are some techniques I've discovered that might change your makeup game:

# Ombré and Multi-Color Effects

This is where having different colored sponges really shines for actual makeup application. When creating an ombré effect with blush or bronzer, I use different colored sponges for different shades to prevent them from mixing too much.

For example, when doing a sunset-inspired blush look, I'll use my yellow sponge for the golden bronzer, pink sponge for the rosy blush, and purple sponge for the deeper berry tone. This keeps the colors distinct while still allowing me to blend them where they meet.

The same technique works amazingly for multi-toned highlighter applications. Using separate sponges prevents the highlighter shades from becoming a muddled mess and helps maintain that gorgeous dimensional glow.

[**Check out this amazing set of multi-colored makeup sponges on Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZYKFNLK?tag=beauty04a2-20)

# Beyond Foundation: Unexpected Uses

While foundation application might be what makeup sponges are best known for, they're incredibly versatile tools that can be used for so much more:

* **Setting powder**: A damp sponge presses powder into the skin much more effectively than a brush, creating a seamless finish that doesn't look cakey.
* **Blending cream contour**: The pointed end of a teardrop sponge fits perfectly into the hollows of the cheeks for precise contour placement.
* **Applying skincare**: I use a clean, damp sponge to apply serums and moisturizers when my skin is feeling sensitive. It's gentler than fingers and helps products absorb more evenly.
* **Fixing makeup mistakes**: A clean, slightly damp sponge can quickly fix eyeshadow fallout without disturbing your foundation underneath.
* **Creating a natural fake tan**: For self-tanner application on the face, nothing beats a makeup sponge for streak-free results.

Having multiple colors means I can dedicate specific sponges to these different tasks without confusion or cross-contamination.

# My Final Thoughts on Multi-Colored Makeup Sponges

After using multi-colored makeup sponges for over a year now, I honestly can't imagine going back to using a single, mono-colored sponge. The organizational benefits alone have been worth the switch, not to mention the improvements in my makeup application and overall hygiene routine.

If you're on the fence about trying them, I'd say go for it! Even if you're a makeup minimalist, having just 2-3 different colored sponges will make your routine more hygienic and help you keep track of when it's time for replacements.

For the more adventurous beauty lovers, a full rainbow set opens up so many possibilities for organization and specialized application techniques. Plus, they just make getting ready in the morning a little more fun — and who couldn't use a bit more joy in their daily routine?

Whether you're a makeup novice or a seasoned beauty guru, multi-colored makeup sponges are one of those simple upgrades that make you wonder why you didn't try them sooner. Trust me, your skin (and your makeup collection) will thank you!

1jitu3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1jitu3g/indirect_prepping/,Indirect Prepping,"I only started prepping in the last month or two, so I'm new to all of this, but I felt compelled to be doing something to insulate us (my husband and myself) as much as possible from whatever might be coming down the pike. So far, I've gotten some water storage methods, made bug out bags, started a food stockpile, gotten some extras of home maintenance items, and done a few other things. My husband also stood up some computer backup drives, a home media system, and got us a hefty portable battery and solar panel package. Thankfully we have savings, but we're in professional fields that could be threatened in a collapse, so we are trying to be mindful of spending as well, while balancing it against necessary purchases and still allowing ourselves to live life.

In learning about all of this recently, I've also found myself doing some things which I feel can be described as ""indirect"" prepping activities. Most of these items just serve to stretch our existing supplies as long as possible, where in the past maybe we didn't pay much attention to how much of a thing we were using.

1. We've limited eating out to 1x per week, though we are aware even this is a luxury and may need to be further restricted.
2. I've started eating properly portioned meals, namely cereal and snacks; I'm not depriving myself of anything but I'm trying to be mindful. This is good for me on many fronts.
3. We've been making a bigger effort to actually eat all the food we buy and not let anything go to waste, even leftovers. There's only the two of us so it makes it easy to only cook an amount we will actually finish.
4. I've stopped drinking coffee altogether. This is no great loss for me, I can take or leave it. My husband has scaled back from a full 10-cup pot to only four cups brewed per day.
5. We switched from traditional paper towels to reusable microfiber ones. We probably won't give up traditional ones altogether, but this should help us make the packs we buy last longer.
6. Similarly, we've started washing and reusing plastic Ziplock bags if they're not too soiled.
7. I've started to be mindful of how much TP I'm using, lol. We also have a bidet.
8. I've started paying attention to how much shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, dish soap, and laundry soap I use, too, and I'm trying to figure out the minimum amount that gets the job done so I'm not over-using my supply.
9. We're taking better care of our clothing, not washing as frequently where possible (jeans, sweaters, sweatshirts, jackets, etc), and are planning to get a clothesline soon so we can start line drying instead of using the machine.
10. I'm trying to take better care of our existing items, like the vacuum cleaner. I gave it a good clean and checked all the gaskets to try to preserve functionality as long as possible.
11. We're saving all jars from foods we use up, never know when these might be useful.

1jitrg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jitrg8/faecal_vomiting_or_food_poisoning/,Faecal vomiting or food poisoning ?,It was earlier this year. I’d just sat my exams. It was an essay and timed exam. Fwi I got an E for that essay btw. Which is like almost a fail but still a fail what the absolute hell does that mean ?!! Anyway. After exams I treated myself to some well deserved drinks. I’d put a lot of study time into that second exam. To which I received an A. It was a good night. I drunk too much too fast as always and passed out early. I had work the next day. The day went well. But it was the NEXT day that things went wrong. I ordered a toastie for lunch. I work at a food establishment. It was a chicken mayo n cheese on white bread toasted. Or was meant to be. The toastie was undercooked but I still ate it. Mistake. I finished work. Honestly I felt fine. I went home. Then I was met with an immediate feeling of tiredness. So I took a nap. About an hour gone by. I woke up and I was in AGONY. I could barely move I was in so much pain. I didn’t know what to do I thought I was dying. I was so cold but sweating at the same time. My electric blanket was on. I turned it off. The chicken mayo cheese on white bread toasted popped into my head. Why did I eat that it was UNDERCOOKED. My boss had undercooked my toastie I was FURIOUS. I started graphically thinking about the toastie. The texture. The colour. It was white supremacy. I started thinking about racial intolerance. I was combining visuals nobody should. I raced to the toilet and spewed. Thank god. I continued to spew. But it wasn’t a spew I was familiar with. I was colourless. I brought my basin to my bed incase I would have to spew again. And I did. Again the spew was clear. It had an alcohol flavour to it. It smelt clean. Amongst the clear liquid was what looked like mince. I retraced my steps in terms of food but there was nothing I remembered eating that resembled that. I was scared. Was this faecal vomiting? Was this coffee ground? Was this food or alcohol poisoning? All I know is that I was playing the song Klink by death grips in my head from the ex military album that they removed from Spotify. I was cool. I was palliative. I accepted the worst and phoned the emergency services. As there was no blood present I was redirected to the non-emergency helpline. Enough was enough. I decided I wouldn’t phone. I would save myself. I continued to drink water so that I would always have something to throw up. I was drinking milk on and off to settle my stomach and replenish the gut flora in my appendix as I was shitting my spine out. And it was not pretty. It was C-PTSd. I was reminded of the toastie. The smell. I wept. Why this? Why now? I plugged my nose with tissues. It was trauma-informed. Thankfully it was a mild case of food poisoning (I think). I was bedbound for a day. Nauseous. Feverish. Resentful. I had only just finished my exams. And what had I gotten as reward but mild food poisoning. Thankfully the vomiting stopped later that evening. I allowed myself to sleep off the symptoms. I nursed myself slowly back to health. It would be ok. ,1,1742831030.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I got BOTH laproscopic and open myo (lucky me!) and they removed my polyp. 

I should start by saying it’s definitely not fun, but it’s not horrible. If I can do it, you can do it. Before my myomectomy, I RAMPED up my iron (my fibroid made me SUPER anemic): iron infusions, TONS of red meat (will deal with my cholesterol issues after recovery), and iron supplements (Feosol is the best). It made a huge difference. I also did a lot of yoga to make sure that my legs and arms were strong because when your abs are compromised, you rely a lot on leg and arm strength. While this may not be an option for all, GET HELP. I had my mom and my boyfriend around and it made my life much, much easier, both psychologically and physically. 

The day before my surgery, I had to shower with disinfectant soap and sleep on clean sheets. I cleaned my belly button really well with a Q tip. I did the same the morning of my surgery. 

Surgery is a little scary, but I requested that they play Beyonce while they put me to sleep in the OR to make me feel more comfortable. I feel asleep in about .1 seconds. When I woke up, I was in a bit of pain but I was loopy as hell from the meds. 

Standing up for the first time after surgery sucks ass—I won’t sugar coat it. You will feel like if you stand up, your abdomen will rip and all your organs will fall out (this 100000% WONT happen). I had a pillow that I clutched to my abdomen to help ease this feeling and it really helped. For the first couple of days, my boyfriend had to lower me on to the toilet and lift me back up (it was super romantic). I had a little bit of bleeding on my pad, but not much. 

Your shoulders will hurt because trapped gas presses on a nerve that triggers shoulder pain. It feels like you’ve been carrying a really heavy backpack. This will go away the more you fart, so let them rip (also really romantic with my boyfriend)!!!

Take stool softeners as soon as you can because pushing when you poop is just not really an option. Also, GasX for gas pain. I was prescribed oxy, but I only took one per day for the first 4 days because they make you really constipated. The gas pain can be worse than the ab pain, so really try and limit oxy use if you can. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 hours. You don’t want to wait until you’re in pain to take Tylenol or ibuprofen, so just take it on a schedule. My boyfriend and mom tracked my meds, which was really helpful. They set alarms and noted down what I took and when. 

Showering for the first 4 days was hard, but doable. Have someone help you in and out and sit with you. I was worried about falling so having someone there made me feel better. 

I’m a side sleeper and it took about a week to be comfortable enough to sleep on my side. Going from lying down to sitting up required help. My mom or boyfriend would hold my arms and pull me up to sitting. Then, I would let go of one arm while they continued to pull my other. I’d use my free arm to push my legs off the bed, then they would pull my arm again while I pushed off the bed with my free arm. Using your abs really hurts. 

IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES, LIMIT ALLERGENS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Sneezing, coughing, and blowing your nose hurts like a MOTHERf*cker. Especially sneezing. 

It’s now been about two weeks and I feel SO much better—just a bit sore and tired. The first 4 days were rough, but by day 5, I was walking around outside to get a coffee. I did have to take a 2 hour nap afterwards and i walked really slowly, but i did it. 

When i am fully healed in a few weeks, I’m going to rehab my abs before going straight into exercise again. I’m also going to telework for a while because my commute is intense and exhausting. 

The moral of the story: it sucks, but it’s not the worst and it is WORTH IT. Don’t be scared—if I can do it, so can you. Ask people for help, watch a lot of trashy TV, and rest. You got this. ",3,1742831000.0,Fibroids,0,1.0,False

Walter Billings was a rather rich man. He owned a couple of luxury cars, a small yacht that he took out every second weekend to catch some small fish alongside the local breakwater, and finally, a rather modest beachside manor furnished, looking over the crystal-clear waves of the local rural beach, furnished with decorated furniture and expensive paintings. Walter wasn’t a self-made man, far from it. His father had lucked out by investing in the then-unknown tech industry, only to strike it rich when the unknown technology company made it mainstream. Walter had grown up with a lavish lifestyle, and during his younger years, had partied hard and hooked up with enough buxom models to make even the biggest playboys turn green with envy.

  
  
But he wasn’t that kind of man, not anymore.  
  


  
*Time truly changed even the firmest of habits,* Walter thought as he looked himself over in a well-decorated mirror. He used his dexterous fingers to fix the collar of his baby blue dress shirt whilst a beautiful caucasian woman with thick, luscious brown locks observed him carefully from the edge of the king-sized bed. Upon her beautiful face, her expression was almost unreadable- but Walter had known her long enough to notice the small glint in her eyes. After all, they had been married for the last three years.

  
  
“You don’t have to dress up, you know Walt. You look fine enough. It’s good enough for a simple therapist appointment.”

“My father always told me to put my best foot forward, even amongst friends.”  
  
  


Walter finished with his collar just as he heard the groan from the springs of the bed, as Joy stood up and walked over towards him. *Slowly*, each move only made more seductive with the dangerously short pair of red polka-dot summer shorts and tight white tank top that covered her small bosom. She was beautiful, and even after three years of marriage, she only got more gorgeous with each passing year. Joy moved her hips in an almost hypnotic fashion, so much so that his eyes would have bored a hole into the mirror if he looked any longer.  
  
  


She didn’t look much different from the models he had bedded during his adolescent years, or even throughout his late twenties, but there was a bond between them- one he hadn’t felt with any other woman. She snuggled up behind him, and he could feel her small, perky breasts against his clothed back. Her hand slid down his chest, past his tummy, right between his thighs and she squeezed. A small gasp left his suddenly dry lips as a soft whisper echoed within his ears.  
  
  


“Just don’t be too *friendly*. Dr. Springs doesn’t do that kind of service- she’s there to help.”  
  
  


The soft whisper was just like any other, just as breathless, just as seductive- but there was something more. A coldness hidden beneath the bewitching temptation. His heart thumped with his chest, and he licked his lips. “I know, I know. Olivia is just my therapist.” Walter laughed good-naturedly, trying to bury the unease that he had felt within his heart as he took her comment for what it is- a harmless joke. *It had to be,* he thought to himself, *I’m a new man- I’ve left the emotionless sex and partying behind in my twenties,* he finished fussing over his appearance and gave Joy a quick peck on her luscious red lips. He casually walked out of their bedroom, and strolled down the hall until he reached the door, his spare hand stretched to the counter for his phone.  
  
  


“Walt, wait.”  
  
  


“Hmm?  
  
  


Walter’s hand just stopped short of his phone; his head turned towards the voice, where Joy poked her head out from behind the doorframe. The next second, she hurried towards him, a spare phone clutched tightly in her hand.  
  
  


“I… I played some puzzle games on your phone last night and I forgot to charge it when I went to bed. Take this one.”  
The phone looked to be the same model as he owned, and Walter found himself a little confused. Why would she be hurrying out of their room? And why the spare phone- he didn’t remember buying her another. And why would she be playing puzzle games on *his* phone? The situation didn’t make much sense, but he decided to leave it be. For the past three months, Joy had been waking up at all hours of the night recently, calling strangers he didn’t know, or tapping away at her computer. He wasn’t hiding anything on his phone, and playing puzzles was just a bit of harmless fun. *It wasn’t worth the fight*, he thought lightly, deciding not to question the situation any longer. He smiled softly and took the phone from her dainty fingertips.  
  
  


“Ah, okay. See you in an hour or two.”  
  
  


“… Yes, see you then.”  
  


  
  


Joy smiled awkwardly and gave a half-hearted little wave. As Walter opened his luxury car’s door and pressed the button to start the engine, he thought Joy’s actions this morning were… for lack of a better word, odd.  
  
“I swear that woman of mine gets stranger each and every year.”

\---------------------------------------------------------------------  
Joy stood by the door, clutching her husband’s phone tightly as she discreetly watched the black luxury car slowly- *far too slowly, just hurry the hell up, Walt*\- reverse out of the newly power-washed driveway. Walter sped down the street and out of sight, and she sighed in relief, grasping the cloth of her tank top as she did so, her heart still thumping hard in her ribcage. With a small frown on her red lips, Joy retched the designer fox fur jacket off the coatrack, and placed the material over her shoulders and arms, before she swiftly walked out into the front garden.  
  
  


Then she *waited*.  
  
  


https://preview.redd.it/p64gtegtqnqe1.jpg?width=414&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e78a3dfb119c28389cde9334467e47b6d4f4e8f5

Joy wasn’t left waiting for long though, only a minute or two at most, before a dirty black hatchback pulled up into the driveway, exactly where her husband’s car had been less than five minutes prior. The window was glazed over, so it was almost impossible to see through the glass, but she could make out that behind the wheel was a woman, from the petite silhouette. She knew this car and knew the woman who drove it by name. Emily was her name, and despite knowing her for three months, only had never gotten her last name. And even then, Joy was unsure if Emly was truly her real name or an alias.  
  


  
She walked up shyly, hesitantly, towards the driver’s window before she stood awkwardly, bouncing on her heels as a whole bunch of butterflies flew around her gut. The window rolled down- *slow, far too slow*\- to reveal a slender brunette with bottle-green eyes that could be considered quite pretty. The passenger seat was littered with fast food, and the back seat held two child seats, with a bunch of toys tossed around the back like a bomb had gone off. Emily extended a hand out of the window, and she flashed an award-winning smile. Joy handed the woman Walter’s phone, her hand shaking- *stop shaking! You’ve known about this for three months*\- all the while.“Today’s the day, Joy. Excited, are we?” Emily gazed at her shaky hands and absentmindedly tapped away at the steering wheel.  
  
  


“No, not excited. I’m nervous and a little scared, to be honest.”  
  
“Don’t be. We’ve done this whole thing hundreds if not thousands of times. There’s nothing to worry about- the police won’t be able to reasonably suspect you.” Emily was easygoing- *too easygoing, you would never expect her to be…*\- and quite likable, but the way she smiled so easily bothered Joy to no end.  
  
“No, that’s not what I meant. I know that you and your… coworkers are professionals. But I want to know, will… will Walt be in pain?”  
  
“Ah, *that’s* what it is.” The brunette shook her head, an exasperated sigh left her glossy, red lip gloss lips as she rolled her eyes lazily.  
  
“And what is ‘that’s what it is’?” Joy was angry now. Scared, angry, and frustrated. The butterflies in her stomach threatened to explode, and her heart thumped rapidly within her chest, and her hands shook for an entirely different reason.  
  
“Haha. That was a mouthful, wasn’t it!”  
  
“Answer the damn question, Emily. Until all…. Until all of *it* is over, I’m still your client, and you, my contractor.”  
  
“… I guess that’s what we are. Nothing strange about it- our relation is strictly business, after all.” She looked at her phone, and a message from a person named Jessica appeared. Emily tapped away at the screen, her hand covering the phone screen all the while before she pocketed it. “I can’t tell you about our previous contracts but I'll tell you that there’s absolutely-” Joy forced herself not to cringe as the woman popped the word as it left her mouth “-nothing strange about our clients getting cold feet. It’s quite common, especially with cases like yours. But if you didn’t want him *dealt* with, you wouldn’t have hired us, Joy. That’s the simple truth. We’ve all worked hard these past three months. Jessica, Olivia, the Secretary, me, and *you* have all worked hard for today- for this moment. You’re almost at the finish line, Joy.”  
  
  


“So, you’re telling me to just… just get over it?!”  
  
“Yeah, pretty much. It’s going to happen whether you regret it or not now. Today is his final therapy session with Alice… or should I say, Dr. Springs\~.” Her phone buzzed once more but she paid it no mind, but her easy-going attitude turned slightly more serious. “And to answer your veeerry first question, it’ll be painful. And whilst I haven’t ‘experienced’ it personally, I have dealt it out enough to understand that drowning is not a good way to go. It’s a very slow and uncomfortable way to die, but look on the bright side, Joy; at least your hubby won’t meet his end in a toilet bowl.”  
Joy ignored the last sentence and bowed her head a little, her heart as heavy as lead.  
  
  


“Will you… can you make it as comfortable as possible?”  
  
  


“I can’t, and neither will Jessica. We’ll be busy settling loose ends, but I’ll let Alice and the Secretary know. No promises though, we might be called the Styx Escort Company, but a ‘good time’ is the last thing be to do.”  
  
  


“Thanks, Emily. That’s all I ask of you.”  
  
  


“Whelp, better be off now. Catch you on the flipside Joy.”  
  
  


“Y-yes.”  
  
  


And with that, Emily rolled her window back up, the petite woman and the children’s toys hidden behind the glazed glass once more. The black hatchback reversed out of the driveway- *a car decal of a woman and two kids slapped on the back window*\- and sped off in the same direction that her husband had gone. Joy stood for a little, trying to calm her racing heart, before she turned, and walked towards the front door of her house, trying to not walk too fast, trying not to look suspicious.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  


Walter parked in front of the small shopping centre, completely butchering the reverse parking as he did so, almost taking up two parking spaces. He was risking a parking ticket, but Jessica guessed that when you were as rich as Walter Billings was, you could afford to risk the parking ticket. *Lucky bastard*, she thought as she leaned against a dirty garage can, her phone in her hand and music blaring into her ears from her Bluetooth headphones.

  
  


*Target just pulled up.*

https://preview.redd.it/hklk9wmvqnqe1.jpg?width=894&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c945a26df5b139668aaf152ced7172b59e8fdcb

Jessica tapped lazily upon her phone as she twirled her long locks of bright green hair, sending the message through the group chat created solely for the assassination of Walter Billings. Walter opened his car door, a small smile on his lips. Unknowing of what fate lay before him within Alice’s ‘therapy’ office.  
  
  


*All good, be driving past in a few minutes. Clients making a fuss and wants to make the assassination comfortable, lol.*  
  
Emily replied, and Jessica could only shake her head, hearing the brunette's annoying voice as she read the message, much to her chagrin. It wasn’t good that the client was getting cold feet, but the money had already been paid in full, and they had enough blackmail on the target’s wife without risking themselves in the process if she ever decided to go rogue. And if that didn’t work, well, she could be found in some river as her husband would be within the next hour or two.  
  
The Styx Escort Company had been paid seventy thousand dollars, paid upfront and in cash, for the assassination of Walter Billings. The Secretary had already taken her cut of the pie, two thirds to be exact- which aggravated Jessica to no end, but since she was a co-founder of their little company of killers-for-hire, she naturally took a large amount of risk, it made sense that she was entitled such a nice payday. Before the assignment had already truly begun, forty-six thousand, six hundred and sixty-six dollars, give and take a few cents, was already taken from the money pile. Alice, who had acted as Walter’s therapist, had naturally taken half of what was left so that twenty-three thousand had been reduced to a measly eleven thousand. Out of the seventy thousand that had been paid, Jessica would only be to leave with a little under six thousand dollars. Emily, naturally, got the same amount.  
  
  


The amount of money she had gotten wasn’t all that much, and for such a large sum to begin with, Jessica was secretly miffed by the whole fiasco, but she couldn’t really say that it was *unfair*. The Secretary had shouldered the most risk, and Alice spent two hours a week for three months gaining the trust of the target, something that she couldn’t possibly do. Sure, all it had taken was a ten-dollar fake college degree from some out-of-the-way university and the word of his wife, but the social skills and ‘womanly’ touch Alice used to fake her way through the weekly session was amazing. Not that Jessica would say that to her face.  
  
  


All she had to really do was show up, take the targets car, and follow Emily to a couple kilometres into the bush, where an out-of-the-way bridge stood over a fast-flowing river. Her part in this whole assassination wasn’t all that large, and nearly six thousand dollars for an hour’s work was well worth it. It would tide her over until the next ‘gig’ in a couple of weeks, with the help of her casual employment at a twenty-four-hour gas station. “Easy money is easy money.” Jessica felt her phone vibrate in her hands again, bringing her thoughts away from money and the near future, to the present.  
  
  


*Understood. Better get to work, Jessica.*  
  
  


The Secretary responded as the target walked up to the glass door, the reply curt and to the point. The target opened the door and walked in the small office hidden between a fashion boutique and a nail salon. As the glass door closed shut, she knew that all that awaited him was damnation. Jessica waited for a moment, making sure that Walter didn’t exit the office in the small chance that he had forgotten something. The door didn’t open and that was good enough, as Jessica was on her way towards the expensive-looking car. She wasn’t much of a car person, but she knew a good-looking car when she saw one, and Walter Billing’s car was as good-looking as metal, and paint could get. She pulled a pair of spare keys from her back jeans pocket that had been made for this specific moment. She pressed the button, and the lights lit up briefly, telling her that the car was unlocked. The next second, Jessica was inside, tapping away at the car's steering wheel as she listened to Taylor Swift whilst she waited for Emily.  
  


  
  


***Honk! Honk!***  
  
  


Jessica looked behind her, out of the freshly cleaned back window, and spied a dirty black hatchback. She threw her headphones onto the passenger seat, and pressed the button- *ooohh, feeling fancy are we Walter*\- to start the car and set off from the gravel parking yard

to the smooth asphalt road to follow the black hatchback.  
  
  


She never looked back.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

Walter opened the semi-transparent glass door and walked into the office building- confidence and a little bit of anxiety within his heart. He had been going here for three months now, and throughout these past couple of months, he had been feeling more confident, more charismatic, and lighter, both literally and figuratively.  
  
  


“Hello. How are you today, Walter.”

https://preview.redd.it/omnyfzoxqnqe1.jpg?width=894&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d763998c495617f262a492860ab8f0f50b14f60

A gorgeous woman in her late twenties with bright blonde hair that had been cut short into an inverted bob sat at the reception desk. He wasn’t much of a fan of short hair, since there was nothing to grip onto during intercourse, a fact he had learned many times during his twenties, but he had to admit that it suited the woman well. She wore a white blouse that only served to enhance her massive breasts, adorned with a small number of frills along the front with buttons that seemed to always be on the verge of popping off.  
  
  


“You surely know the drill by now, Walter. Please take a seat.” The secretary, who he had never gotten her name, waved a hand towards one of the many seats. Seats that he had never seen filled, not even one. If he was a conspiracy theorist, Walter would think that he was their only customer. He walked shyly over to the seat closest to the reception desk, noting how her breasts lay on the counter as she leaned forward.  
  
  


“Ahh, yes. Sorry for staring off into space.”  
  
  


*I didn’t mean to stare, but their just so big, and that blouse just drew even more attention to it. It’s like a fucking black hole.*  
  
  


“Don’t worry about it. I’m used to it.”  
  
  


“You’re not angry?”  
  
  


“No. You’re one of our most important clientele- without people like you, girls like Alice and I would be out of the job. If you wish to stare, then there is not much that I can do.”  
  
“Do your other customers do it too?”  
  
  


“Do what, Walter?”  
  
  


“Stare I mean? And do you call them all by their first names too?”  
  


  
  


“Well, people of the opposite sex do tend to stare into space quite a bit whilst I’m in the room, but you’re the only customer I’m on a first-name basis with. At least, for the moment.” She smiled wistfully, giving a soft girlish giggle as she did so.  
  
  


“Hmm. Is it because my wife is paying more money than your other clients?”  
  
  


“That is part of it, yes, but it is mostly because you are a good man.”  
  
  


“A good man? If I didn’t know any better, I would think you were flirting with me.”  
  
  


“It is nothing so scandalous, Walter- I’m just stating the truth. I just thought that you should know it before the day is done. Today is a very special day, for you especially.”  
  
  


“Special, you say? It’s not my birthday.”  
  
  


“No, but Alice thinks that it’s time to reveal our *special* service. Your wife, Joy, agrees. You could think of it as an early birthday gift.”  
  


  
  


***“Alice, she’s there to help.”***  
  


  
  


“Special service, you say? Is it… of the kinky variety.”  
  


  
“… To some.” The secretary was silent for a brief moment, and the unease that Walter had felt back at his house, in his bedroom with his wife returned full force. Only for a moment though, as the blonde swiftly stood up- showing off a short and impossibly tight dark blue pencil skirt. She walked over to the white door behind her, swaying her hips, showing off her impressive rear end and a visible panty line.  
  


  
*I’m sure that Joy would be fuming with rage. Some women are just loved by the world.*  
  


  
“Dr. Springs will see you now, Walter.”  
  


  
He stood up, his cheeks flushed, and his pants tighter than they were just a few moments ago. He walked through the door, his confidence high and his libido even higher.  
  


  
*Thanks, Joy. Best wife ever.*

  
  


\---------------------------------------------------------------------

He entered a small room, furnished with two chairs in the centre, and an office desk placed in the far corner of the room, next to the office bathroom. A small light green jug and a couple of mugs had been placed on another desk right next to the entrance. It felt a little cramped, but there was more than enough room in the centre of the room, wide enough for two full-grown men to lie down on the floor. It looked cheap, and not what he had expected with the hefty paycheck that Joy had paid up front. Maybe his upbringing and lavish lifestyle had desensitised him to anything that was on either side of the spectrum of economics.  
  


  
He heard the flush of a toilet and the sound of splashing water from a bathroom faucet. A door opened, and a pretty long-haired redhead strolled out, a tea towel held in her hands, wiping off whatever water was left. Whenever she entered the office, Walter felt that this entire room cost a couple thousand more. The woman was dressed in a white blouse and a tight black pencil skirt that was quite short, reaching her lower thighs. She had never worn such clothes before, so he assumed that it was about the special service that was mentioned earlier. The woman lacked the twin peaks that the blonde secretary had, but he knew from personal experience that she made up for it with her great posterior.

https://preview.redd.it/tgu3cs32rnqe1.jpg?width=894&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcf83727f4400b686ae648433e847720797f020b

  
  
“Ahh, Walter. Good to see you in good health.” Alice smiled softly as she finished drying her hands with the tea towel, and instead of placing it on the office desk, like any other day- she held onto it. Strange. Today was full of strange occurrences, but Walter wasn’t one to forget good manners just because he felt like everything was out of whack.  
  


  
  


“You as well, Alice.”  
  


  
“You’re far too kind. Please take a seat and we’ll get started shortly.” The woman walked around him, and towards the jug of water- just like any other therapy session he had had with the woman. He watched as subtly as he could, his eyes almost glued too her buttocks. Whilst the secretary’s buttocks were of a decent size, Alice’s was a good couple of sizes bigger, with the skirt showing a visible panty line.

  
  


  
*I wonder if I asked her to sit on me, would she? Surely, she would- the secretary was giving hints that I would be a fool to misunderstand.* In the back of his mind, Walter imagined Alice’s rear end hovering over his head, the pencil skirt crawling up to expose her thighs and the cloth hidden behind it, before she sat upon his face- ass and all. His penis throbbed from within the prison that was his pants, and Walter tried to breathe deeply to quell his arousal. It didn’t work. “I heard that today had a special service.”  
  


  
“Ohh, my secretary told you, didn’t she? That was meant to be a surprise, Walter.” Her tone was light as if she wasn’t all that surprised that he knew. Was this a joke? Or something more?  
  


  
“Please don’t trouble her, Alice. I’m sure she understands my discomfort towards surprises. Although, I wouldn’t be averse to the special service she mentioned before.” He responded, his tone light, keen to keep the foreplay going.  
  


  
All that responded to him was silence.  
  


  
“Alice?”  
  


  
“Oh? Yes, I’m sure that we’ll have a great time. Although, before we begin would you like a cup of coffee, Walter? I often hear that it’s good to have before such *heavy* exercise.”  
  


  
“Is that what you are doing back there? Preparing, I mean?”  
  


  
“Alice, everything oka- hmmmph!” Another moment of silence occurred, and Walter felt a little concern. He turned his body slightly so that he could see what Alice was doing, only to be greeted by the same tea towel that the therapist had used to dry her hands. She forced the damp material over his mouth and nose, her other hand gripping the back of his head in a way that instantly began to hurt, her finger entangled in his short hair.  
  


  
*What in the actual fuck! What kind of fucking foreplay is this?!*  
  


  
“Get in here. Bring the river water and the tarp.”  
  


  
He tried to pull back, but Alice held firm. His hands gripped her arms and should, flailing around like a fish out of water. He didn’t want to hurt her, but what she was doing to him was hurting his scalp and making him feel a little lightheaded. The secretary opened the door, a sheet of plastic tarp and a roll of pallet wrap held in both her armpit, and a gallon container of dirty water clutched in both her hands. *Why the fuck would she need those?!* His head felt numb- *distant*, and his hands felt like lead had replaced his bones.  
  


  
“Roll out the tarp. Yes, right there- between the seats.”  
  


  
He heard Alice shout at the secretary, and then his arms went limp, falling to his sides. His vision went dark the next, and he plunged into the darkness of unconsciousness.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------  
Alice removed the chloroform-soaked tea towel from Walter’s face the second that his arms had gone limp and his eyes had rolled back into his skull. She swiftly released the clump of hair she had held onto during the brief struggle, forcing the target back into the cheap office chair as she did so. She moved towards the office bathroom with haste, picking up the plastic funnel, intubation tube, and filled surgical syringe hidden away from sight. She returned to the office to the sight of the blonde secretary holding the tea towel back over the target's mouth and nose once more.

  
  


  
“Alice, he was on the verge of awakening- so I administered another dose.”  
  
Alice nodded, quickly getting down on her knees and leaning forward to remove the target's left shoe, and swiftly took off his sock- which she was certain was worth more than the fifty-dollar chair he sat upon. She grasped the needle with her left hand and held his foot tenderly with her right. The ‘therapist’ felt him kick at her lightly with her foot, a sign of regaining consciousness but that soon stopped when her boss placed the tea towel over his face once more. She pricked the space between his pinkie toe and the ring toe- the syringe full of suxamethonium had stopped the chance of him moving, even if fully conscious.  
  
“All done\~. Let’s get him onto the tarp.”  
  
Alice grabbed his calves, and the secretary gripped under his armpits, and together they carried the one-hundred-and-forty-pound man onto the blue tarp. His eyes were open, moving around wildly as he struggled to comprehend why they had attacked him, and why he couldn’t move a muscle. Alice would have a fair amount of enjoyment by informing him all about that.  
  
She stood over him, her short pencil skirt rolled up to her waist when she had drugged him, so she was showing everything under her dress shirt. And judging by the way that his eyes had been glued to her thighs and crotch- Alice *almost* felt sorry for the man, for the ‘good time’ they had all but promised him, only to be left paralysed and completely at their mercy. The ‘therapist’ had even worn his favourite colour today- purple. She would bet the money she had made on this hitjob that he would be disappointed that he would never get to see what was behind it. It was a real shame, but that is just how this line of business works.  
  
“During your brief time of unconsciousness, I had injected a dose of suxamethonium into your body. It’s a neuromuscular blocker that lasts around ten minutes, and your body has enough oxygen for six minutes at most, so this is the end, Walter.” Alice walked beside him and crouched down at him, her red locks laying upon his chubby cheeks. She gripped those same cheeks with her thumb, index, and middle finger, squeezing and moving his head from side to side for a couple of seconds. ""Joy helped arrange our therapy sessions so that we could do this for her. Joy wanted you to know that this is nothing personal, it's only about the will and the insurance money.  
  
“I know that this has got to be scary for you, but it won’t last long. A few minutes at most. For all that it is worth, which is very little, I'm afraid, I have greatly enjoyed our weekly catchups. Or should I still call them our weekly therapy sessions? Would that make this whole fiasco a little easier for you?” Alice walked toward where she had left the intubation tube and bent down to reach it. She could feel his eyes bore a hole into her backside, and all she could do was smirk.  
  
She turned around and walked back, funnel and intubation tube in each hand, spying the secretary tenderly caress his red cheeks. Once more she kneeled alongside him, and the buxom blonde gripped either side of his shoulders, lifting his torso ten centimeters off the ground, forcing Walter’s head to tilt back due to his lack of motor functons. His eyes, naturally, gazed at the secretary’s massive breasts- despite being in the process of being assassinated, the man was still filled with lust.  
  
“Men are simple creatures, but that only makes our job all the more easy.”  
  
Alice forced his mouth open with the hand that wasn’t holding the plastic tube, and due to the suxamethonium, he offered no resistance. She swiftly forced the intubation down his throat, not caring at his expression of discomfort or pain. Once she felt that it was far enough done in his throat, she attached the small funnel to the tube. The secretary held the gallon container of water with both hands, the container far too heavy for her to hold with a single hand, before pouring it down into the funnel. It came out in a rush, so quite a bit of water spilled out of the funnel, splashing onto the floor and Walter’s shirt. They had prepared the tarp for the former, and it didn’t really matter how wet the target got; they already had a way to dispose of the body and make it look a suicide, his getting a little wet before him hardly mattered. The result was the same, no matter how wet Walter Billings got. The secretary gently placed the container beside his head, and gently grasped his hand, gripping tightly.  
  
""It's okay, Walter. Alice and I are here with you, you're not all alone.""  
  
“Isn’t it kind of cruel to hold his hand like a lover and whisper sweet nothings? Especially with the bald-faced lie we told him only a couple of minutes ago?” Her tone was light, but the mocking smile on her face was as clear as the morning sky outside the office they had rented for the past three months for this little assassination. ""You're just giving him false hope- both the sexual and the survival kind."" Alice reached down to his crotch, and gave it a decent rub and good-hard squeeze before flicking it with her dainty fingers, enjoying the way Walter's eyes squinted shut. Perhaps she was a little bit too rough, but the 'therapist' doubted getting sexually assaulted was all that high on his list of worries at the moment.  
  
“Emily said that his wife wanted him to be comfortable. The special service may have been partly a lie, but he’s a good man. We might have been hired to snuff out his flame for these past three months, but that does not erase the pleasant memories we had made along the way.” The secretary brought his limp hand to her limp, kissing it gently and drawing circles into his palm like a woman comforting a lover as they recovered in a hospital bed. “He never deserved this. It's a pity.”  
*It's not far off analogy, just replace the lover and hospital bed with a hapless victim, a murderess, and a drenched tarp.*  
  
“Hmm, I guess he was a little unlucky to marry such a greedy, no-good woman.”  
  
“Indeed, he was.”  
  
Alice gripped his other hand, leaning down to kiss the forehead of the man she had all but murdered in cold blood and mocked only thirty seconds ago. He wasn’t her first kill, nor was he going to be the last. *That’s just how it is, though.* “Nothing we could have done anyway.” *Your wife hired us, and we had no real reason to refuse, especially with the money she had all but thrown at our feet.*  
  


  
“Indeed, there was nothing that could have been done. Good men die every day.”  
  


  
The secretary whispered that sentence, gently laying Walter Billings's hand back onto the wet, blue tarp. Alice, still holding his hand, looked into his open eyes- half-expecting him to still be switching his gaze from the blonde's impressive bust to her purple-clad crotch. He did neither, his eyes staring straight at the white ceiling, dead to the world around him. *That made complete sense though*, Alice thought, *since he was no longer a living person, reduced to nothing more than a corpse. He is dead to the world, and to the world, he is dead to it*.

  
  


  
  


“Guess we’re done here.” Alice announced softly, her voice a whisper, feeling it would be disrespectful to shout at the moment. Slowly, she removed the intubation tube from his throat, not out of any new-found care for her target, but to not leave a trace that there had been an intubation tube forced down his throat in the first place. She wrapped it around her hand and packed it up with the funnel into a small carry bag that she had hidden under the seat where this whole murder had truly begun.

  
  
“Yes. Another successful assignment.”  
  


  
Alice and the secretary grabbed either side of the oversized blue tarp, rolling it around Walter’s corpse until you could barely make out that it was human. They wrapped him in pallet wrap before they lifted him off the ground and carried him out of the office- acting like this was all normal, acting like they had done nothing wrong. They dumped him gently into the backseat of the secretary’s cheap car that she had brought off Craigslist a month prior with company funds.

  
  


  
The buxom blonde placed the key in the ignition and twisted it sharply- starting the engine. She shifted the truck into gear and then the pair of assassins were off onto the open asphalt road, following the same path that Jessica and Emily had taken- Walter Billings lying in the backseat, wrapped like a a birthday present, visible to them both from the rearview mirror.  
  


  
*The secretary was right, Walter. It was a special day for you- just not the way you had been led to believe when you walked through those doors. Hope you enjoyed it, after all, it's not every day that two beauties deepthroat you.*

  
  


  
“Keep cosy back there, Walter. We’re in for a long drive,” Alice laughed in a way most would call good-naturedly, a laugh that the corpse that lay still on the backseat had once told her was quite pretty during one of their little sessions.

  
  


  
“Hey, this has to be number two-thirty.”

  
  


  
“No, Alice. Walter Billings was your two hundredth and fifty-fourth target.”

  
  


  
“Damn, I was really close too. Why couldn’t you have just let me have it? Just this once?”

  
  


  
“Nothing comes easy.”

  
  


  
“You’re speaking from experience?”

  
  


  
“Indeed.”  
  


  
They would drive for about an hour, stopping in the bush in the middle of nowhere on a random bridge. Jessica and Emily would have already parked there, waiting for the pair to arrive. The four assassins would unwrap Walter Billings from his pallet wrap and tarp, before throwing him into the water below. They would drive off, Jessica and Emily in the hatchback, and Alice and the secretary in the cheap car.",1,1742830972.0,hitwomanfantasies,0,1.0,True

1jitnjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jitnjr/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"I [21F] was walking down the road a few weeks ago, a guy [28M]came up to me while I was walking and asked for  my number. He commented how beautiful I am, asked me a little about myself what I was studying etc. He told me a little about him as well when I asked him. He said he was from Turkey. For reference I am from and living in Northern Europe. I was really hesitant so I didn’t give him my number but took his. After looking him up and verifying what he told me, I messaged him. We start texting and he was messaging me everyday. I am in university so it was difficult to message him all the time when he was texting me. We continued and he constantly asked when I would be available for a date. I wasn’t available during the weekdays as I have school. 
Also, Ramadan is talking place at the moment so he wouldn’t have been able to eat during the daytime if we met, but he still seemed keen to meet me. 
Eventually, we arrange a date for Sunday (yesterday) for a walk and coffee. 
On Saturday he calls me and after talking on the phone for the first time, asks if I want to have dinner in the evening. I had no plans so I said ok. We arranged to get food at a place near my house. 

We also talked about ourselves while on the phone, he asked about previous relationships and I answered and asked him too. He told me his previous relationship was 6 months ago and it was 1 year long. He also asked me specifically ifI am a jealous person in relationships. I said no. 
I asked why did he ask that and he said his last girlfriend was very very jealous so he doesn’t like that. 
I concluded then that he must not be jealous or anything like that…
We made the plans for 7pm but I ended up being delayed at my house so we didn’t meet until 8.( I kept him updated and apologised profusely for all this, he said it was no problem. )
Also, I didn’t have him pick me up from my house as I didn’t know who this man was, I didn’t think it was a big deal and it was my first time having a fate with him. 

We had dinner, it was fine, talked about ourselves, our family, school, work. General things. I told him I lived in my family house. He asked questions about my family and school. 
I also had told him about myself when we spoke on the phone. 
He was friendly and paid for dinner and seemed happy about the meal. 
He dropped me back where he collected me. 
I told him I would confirm the time for the date on Sunday with him as we hadn’t figured out the exact time. 


Yesterday (Sunday) he texted asking about what time suited. 
I said I was going to be delayed by the same problem as yesterday so It would be later than expected. 

I met him at the same place as Saturday. We got in the car and he drove me down the road and had little chit chat. I also apologised again for the unexpected problems.  

He then pulled over, at the start of this convo he asked my age and I asked his to clarify things, I’m 21 and he’s 28. I thought he might be younger and he thought I was a bit older. He asked me more  about my family and if he could see a picture of them. I said ok. I don’t really have any photos of my whole family on my phone, other then photos from weddings, individual photos, photos with each sibling etc. 
I explained that to him and showed him some photos that I did have. 
I was also hesitant to show him photos as I don’t know this man. 

He went on to say how he was uncomfortable moving forward and is suspicious and feels like I’m lying to him. 

I was gobsmacked and felt like it came out of nowhere as this was only the second time we had spoken in person.

I was so confused and asked why he was suspicious, he said I should have more photos of my family on my phone and he wants to see them, he also said that he didn’t think I lived where I said I lived. I explained I did but I didn’t want him to come to my house because I don’t know him well yet. I am very honest so I was shocked where this was coming from. He insinuated that I didn’t really live with my parents and I was lying about that. 
I ended up showing him my id for proof of address, lots of photos of my parents, my family, my pets my friends. I showed him a photo I took of my brother with our dog TAKEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. 
He said he still didn’t believe me. 

I was so confused. 
He then went on about how I’m definitely hiding something because I am so shocked and seem to be trying to ‘prove something’. 😵‍💫😵‍💫
This was all in his car after he had pulled over. We were meant to get a drink and a nice walk. 
I then reasoned with him that I believed his story yet I hadn’t any proof, he has seen more proof of me and my life than I had him yet he still didn’t believe me for some reason. I would have never even asked to see his family, I just believed him. 
I asked why he though I would lie about that? And he didn’t have an answer. I asked if he had any trust issues or feels like he’s ready for a relationship and he said he felt what he is saying is justified and needs to express it. 
The more I tried to convince him, the less he seemed to believe. ..
I felt like I was being interrogated the whole time. 
I couldn’t believe it and then said ‘ oh well would you show me your family? You haven’t shown me anything yet but I am meant to trust you’ he then said he wouldn’t be showing me because he didn’t trust me. 
He drove me back to where he dropped me before, I stayed in the car and he let me know he would think about things but might not want to see me again. I ended up showing this man, my family, my id for PROOF OF ADDRESS, my university app to show him I actually was a student, and he still seemed unsure. I was so confused. I asked if this was made up and maybe there was another reason he wouldn’t want to see me again? Maybe I’m not attractive to him? He said no, he found me absolutely gorgeous. HE THEN TRIED TO GET ME TO KISS HIM. It was very weird. Like why would you want to kiss me if you think I’m lying to you? When I expressed even more confusion for him trying to kiss me after him being so adamantly dissatisfied with me, he told me it is normal, as if we were in a relationship together and had a disagreement, he would be direct like this, clarify things and then want to kiss me. We hadn’t clarified anything as he still wasn’t satisfied with the proof I showed him and was getting ready to leave his car.He  then also talked to me about sex and how attractive he found me, I was surprised by this as I was aware he was fasting for Ramadan at the same moment. He asked if I was attracted to him as I didn’t seem to express that. I reassured him and told him again I wouldn’t have gone out with him if I didn’t feel that way. He then again suggested we kiss and said it was ok as it’s the second date. I told him not today. 
I ended up leaving his car and told him I would give him time to think, after showing him evidence of my whole existence. He told me he will think more once he finally eats and maybe he will be able to think better then. 


So that is my story. I am surprised about this, is this a red flag? Am I a red flag? 

I just thought it was a bit strange as I automatically believed him and didn’t end up seeing 1 photo as evidence of what he told me, I showed him proof of my whole life and he didn’t believe me. Thoughts? Is this because he is Turkish? Maybe it is a cultural difference. I don’t want to seem ignorant but I am genuinely confused,Is this normal for Muslim men? Am I missing something here?

But, since my pregnancy I've developed grayish brownish staining on my teeth, especially near the gumline despite being even more obsessive than usual about oral hygiene. The only thing I can think of is the fact that I now have terrible reflux 24/7 that might be messing up my enamel and I had severe morning sickness and frequent vomiting until about 18 weeks. But, the staining is getting worse now and I'm at 25 weeks.

He commented how beautiful I am, asked me a little about myself what I was studying etc. He told me a little about him as well when I asked him. He said he was from Turkey. For reference I am from and living in Northern Europe. I was really hesitant so I didn’t give him my number but took his. After looking him up and verifying what he told me, I messaged him. We start texting and he was messaging me everyday. I am in university so it was difficult to message him all the time when he was texting me. We continued and he constantly asked when I would be available for a date. I wasn’t available during the weekdays as I have school. 
Also, Ramadan is talking place at the moment so he wouldn’t have been able to eat during the daytime if we met, but he still seemed keen to meet me. 
Eventually, we arrange a date for Sunday (yesterday) for a walk and coffee. 
On Saturday he calls me and after talking on the phone for the first time, asks if I want to have dinner in the evening. I had no plans so I said ok. We arranged to get food at a place near my house. 

We also talked about ourselves while on the phone, he asked about previous relationships and I answered and asked him too. He told me his previous relationship was 6 months ago and it was 1 year long. He also asked me specifically ifI am a jealous person in relationships. I said no. 
I asked why did he ask that and he said his last girlfriend was very very jealous so he doesn’t like that. 
I concluded then that he must not be jealous or anything like that…
We made the plans for 7pm but I ended up being delayed at my house so we didn’t meet until 8.( I kept him updated and apologised profusely for all this, he said it was no problem. )
Also, I didn’t have him pick me up from my house as I didn’t know who this man was, I didn’t think it was a big deal and it was my first time having a fate with him.

The pieces on display are available for purchase, with 50% of proceeds being donated to female-focused nonprofits chosen by the artists, including Compass Center of Orange County, Educate Girls US, El Futuro, The Retreat @ Fernwood, The Women’s Center and Profound Ladies.

* The years 2024 and 2025 mark the sixtieth anniversaries of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The two Acts transformed life in the United States for many marginalized individuals, including people of color, women, people with disabilities, elders, and others who had not had equal rights in the nation’s history. This legislation was the culmination of nearly a century of work by activists and advocates.

* “Cannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless” explores and amplifies the problematic colonial history and the concept of cargo cults from an Indigenous perspective. Cargo cults developed as a result of Western military campaigns that sent crated, often airdropped, supplies to foreign lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples.
* This exhibition features several momentual works by the artist, including a large-scale radio made from pine trees titled “The Keep”, three of the artists’s “Transportable Intergenerational Protective infrastructure (TIPI)” works, an immersive video, a series of speaker towers, and a group of Native Americans bustles, a traditional part of Native American Powwow regalia.

1jitkj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawyertalk/comments/1jitkj4/does_anyone_else_use_lamps_in_your_office_rather/,Does anyone else use lamps in your office rather than the big light?,"I'm just kind of curious if this is a ""Dude are you autistic"" thing or just weird boomer shit, so I wanted to ask the community at large. 

  
So in my office - i don't turn on the overhead light. It's way too bright and it gives me a headache if I have it on all day. Plus, it just kind of washes out the office and I feel like it looks like shit. However - I have this huge fucking window that takes up half of one wall and lets in a ton of light during the day. So I usually just have that open and I have two lamps on. Even on rainy days, I still don't turn on the overhead light on unless I'm going through a ton of paper documents because I feel like I can see just fine with the two lamps I have and that my office has plenty of light. A judge I used to work for did a similar thing in his office.

However - my bosses at my old job HATED it. They mentioned it every few days in some way or another, usually passive-aggressively. When we parted ways and I interviewed for my current job, my old bosses brought it up during the reference call, telling my current boss that I had ""weird habits, like sitting in the dark all day and listening to music while he works. He also brought his own coffee every day, even though we told him we had a keurig machine in the kitchen.""

The paralegals and secretaries at this job are all over the age of fifty, and have also mentioned it a couple of times now. 

All that to say: is this really such a weird thing? How do you keep your office lit? Will Goku save Namek?   Do you have habits that seem completely normal and your bosses are just flabbergasted by?

No grogginess. Felt energized, motivated, like I was finally turning a corner in life. The sun hit different. I even made my bed. That never happens.

My outfit? Fire. My playlist? Hitting every vibe. I was early to work, found parking instantly, and even ran into my manager in the elevator who complimented my shoes. Today was the day.

At the office, things just kept going right. Emails were answered, tasks were clicking, and people were actually laughing at my jokes in the team chat. I even texted my mom back. That’s how good I was feeling.

Lunchtime rolls around. I hit my favorite spot. They mess up everyone’s order—except mine. It was hot, fresh, and they gave me extra fries. I swear, I was riding a cosmic high. Nothing could shake me.

And then… 2:47 PM. The moment everything changed.

1jitie6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amateur_Milf_Porn/comments/1jitie6/the_park_bench_revelation/,The Park Bench Revelation,"Golden sunlight filtered through the elm trees as John sat slumped on a Central Park bench that had seen better days - much like himself. At thirty-two, he checked all the boxes: Wall Street analyst salary, a renovated loft in Williamsburg, biceps that filled his dress shirts just right. Yet none of it mattered when his Tinder matches ghosted him after the third message or when his palms sweat through job interviews with attractive female clients.

""Maybe this is just who I am,"" he told a pigeon pecking at his discarded coffee cup. The bird gave him a look that said even it had better prospects.

The bench groaned as an elderly gentleman settled beside him uninvited. Dressed in a tweed jacket that smelled of old books and bergamot, he looked like someone's eccentric grandfather who divided his time between used bookstores and Civil War reenactments. His weathered hands - one bearing what might have been an old Marines tattoo - held an antique wooden box carved with strange symbols.

""That's not your voice I hear, son,"" the stranger said in a tone that reminded John of his favorite college professor. ""That's fear wearing your skin like a cheap suit.""

To his own surprise, John found himself unloading years of pent-up frustration: the way his mind went blank around beautiful women, how he'd invented sudden food poisoning to escape a promising date last month, the sinking feeling that he'd die alone surrounded by takeout containers.

The old man nodded knowingly as he whittled a piece of root that smelled faintly of cinnamon. When John finished, he reached into his coat and produced a leather pouch containing dried herbs that smelled like a campfire in the wilderness - smoky, primal, and inexplicably comforting.

""My grandfather - medicine man from the Blackfoot tribe - called this 'the lion's heart mixture',"" he explained, letting the fragrant leaves tumble into John's palm. ""Not to make you someone else, but to help you remember who you truly are."" He spoke of ancient rituals where warriors would chew certain roots before battle, how frontiersmen used specific berries to steady their nerves during negotiations.

""Today?"" The old man's eyes twinkled as he revealed a modern supplement bottle. ""We've taken nature's wisdom and made it fit your busy Manhattan life."" The label showed [Ancient remedy](https://www.vigrxplus.com/ct/944321?t1=TheParkBenchRevelation) \- a patented blend of those same traditional herbs enhanced with cutting-edge nootropics.

John blinked at the bottle, and when he looked up, the bench stood empty. Only a single hawk feather fluttered where the stranger had been sitting, though no birds circled overhead.

What followed was a metamorphosis so gradual John barely noticed at first. The morning he casually complimented his regular barista without stammering. The Thursday when his yoga instructor ""happened"" to need a partner for demonstrations - three classes in a row. By month's end, women at his coworking space were finding excuses to borrow his charger or ask his opinion on their presentations.

Now, as he sips bourbon at a rooftop bar with a stunning art curator who approached him, John realizes the truth: the confident man was always there, buried under layers of self-doubt and societal expectations. The herbs didn't change him - they simply turned up the volume on his authentic self.

(Snuff/ Silencer/ Neck break)

The forest was dark, and without a moon above the cloak of forest leaves, it was a herculean task to navigate the woods… *unless you possessed a pair of rather expensive night-goggles, then the task was soooo very easy,* Marin Kitagawa thought. With night-vision goggles attached to her face through a series of black straps around head, her vision was a mixture a varying green. Whilst most couldn’t see the back of their out-stretched hand, she could see a small rabbit scatter by her feet, and the stick in her path that would be best to avoid. The world around her was as clear as it would be during the day- *the power of modern technology! Tots awesome!*

https://preview.redd.it/ceq3s4khpnqe1.jpg?width=2480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2201c997938579cd9abebdad73fa30a08781930d

Her feet moved slowly, her every movement calculated- the woman tried to limit any unneeded noise she could possibly have made. Marin regulated her breathing, so that each inhale came through her mouth, and each exhale left through her nose. Gently grasped in within her latex-clad hands, a Glock-19 with an elongated suppressor was pointed downward slightly, the magazine filled with subsonic rounds.



She had taken a taxi into the woods (whom she had paid extra to wait for about three hours), driving by the small dirt path that led to the assigned area, in favour of spending the past hour carefully moving the forest to flank the luxurious forest cabin, to take the target and his personal security off-guard. And dress in a pair of black leggings, and a plain long sleeved black shirt, she had managed to blend into the very darkness of the forest, although the large carry-bag over her shoulder was beginning to be a pain to deal with.



*Haven’t seen anyone yet, but I think I’m getting close to the cabin… so I’ll be finding myself some poor sods soon.*



A small ball of white appeared in the corner of her vision, striking a contrast with the ever-present green of her night vision. It was a light source, and a rather short bot-belly man held the small rifle that the light was attached to, just fifty metres away. She stopped moving, the back of her nape feeling cold despite the warm night. Marin aimed the pistol, finger on the trigger, just a brief twitch from firing a bullet into his skull. She stopped, lowering the pistol back to its original position, and slowly walked to hide behind a nearby tree. She waited, just like a predator in the night.



The security guard moving his light around in a lazy semi-circle, clearly not expecting any foes to be nearby. He walked by the tree she had hidden behind, just half a metre away. Marin grasped the barrel of the rifle with her free hand and slapped the suppressor of her pistol in his cheek. He grunted, and falter back, but she didn’t let up- and hit him right in the nose, this time with the point of her elbow, whilst yanking the rifle from his grasp before he could fire a single round. He leaned back against the tree, blood leaking from his nose, and a slow, broken groan leaving his bloodied lips.



She bent down, her spare hand resting on a knee for balance and the barrel of the suppressor pushed very hard against his temple. “Okay, you’re going to answer my questions. *Quietly*… or I’ll put a bullet between your eyes. You understand right? I didn’t hit you *that* hard? I didn’t give you a concussion?” He continued to groan, but a slow, frightened nod followed. His gun had landed just a few metres away from her, but the barrel had landed to face slightly in his general direction, so the light source attached to it illuminated about the left half of his figure. Marin could have pulled up the nigh goggles so that her vision was half blinded by it, but she thought that having a pair of glowing red orbs glaring at him would intensify the fear factor, along with the suppressed pistol pressed against his temple.



“So, like, how many guards are there? Be honest\~.”



“T-t-ten…”



“Oh, that’s quite a lot. Are they all in the forest, or are you the only one?”



“T-there’s f-f-four of us… the o-other six are at the cabin…”



“Oka-”



“Hayato, do you come copy? You need to check in.” A small voice echoed from the security guard’s hip, rudely interrupting her interrogation, and Marim turned her attention to it briefly to identify what it. It was a walkie-talkie, although, she should probably call it a two-way radio since she was on the clock, *even though a walkie-talkie sounds so much cuter!* “Hayato, are you there? Please respond.”



“Answer it. Anything funny happens, and you get some lead.”



“Uh-hurk… Uh, yeah. T-t-the coast is clear, boss.”



“Don’t scare me like that, man. You sound a little… unusual. You alright?”



“I-it was j-just a c-cool breeze.”



“Hmm, I think it’s rather warm tonight, but… Whatever, just continue to search the perimeter. Try not to freeze to death, ha ha.”



“How often do you need to check in? Like, every ten minutes, half an hour?”



“E-every t-twenty minutes.”



“I can work with that- nighty night\~”



***Pffft***



The subsonic round, along with the elongated silencer caused the noise to be minimal, barely rising above the noise of the gentle forest breeze, and since the point of the barrel was pushed against the pot-bellied guard, he had only an instant to register her words. Marin doubted that Hayato had the time to hear, let alone comprehend, her words before a hole was punched through his temple and his brain turned to mush. His body twitched for a few moments, although it mainly a single hand that did most of it. He went still after a few moments; she didn’t even bother checking his pulse- she knew he was dead.



She flipped up her night vision goggles and turned to walk to his weapon, bending down to pick up the rifle, which turned out to be a M4, and turn off the light. She flipped her goggles back over her eyes, her vision unhampered by the light. Nodding to herself, she continued to walk to the cabin, gently placing the weapon upon the pot-bellied guard’s lap. *Huh, I’ve already forgotten your name Mr. Potbelly, tots sorry about that.* She doubted that anyone would find him tonight though, or for the next couple of weeks… perhaps a stray wolf would have a nice supper after she had finished her job here, leaving what was left of him for hikers to find. This cabin was private property, and although the target let people hike, it wasn’t all that common for people to do so… but it wasn’t rare either.



*Not my problem, I didn’t get paid enough for this job to clean up. Besides, digging a hole wouldn’t be any good- I would get callouses! The travesty!*



She proceeded to dump her carry bag onto the ground, fishing out a drone that she had often used for cosplay shoots with her boyfriend, Gojo Wakana. However, this drone had a little secret- it had night vision, and it was connected to her phone via Bluetooth. She pressed the power button and tapped a few buttons on her phone. The drone flew, and the entire forest was below her, as clear as day. She left the carry-bag next to the dead guard and marked the location on the map app of her phone.



“Time to go hunting.”



*Time to earn some rent, and college tuition money!*

Marin’s walk was still calculated, although a little rushed. It had taken a little under an hour to deal with a *single* guard. Sure, she had spent most of that time flanking them, but she had been able to take her time because there hadn’t been a time limit. She could have taken three hours, *and wouldn’t that have been a slog*, and not a single thing would have changed. However, now that she had killed Mr. Potbelly, she had a twenty-minute timer ticking away within her mind. She had to deal with four guards before the target and his security detail inside the cabin, so that when she went into to kill them all, she wouldn’t have a bunch of unexpected guns pointed at her cute little back.



Although finding the roaming guards was rather easy with the help of her night-vision drone, since in only a couple of minutes, she had managed to find a pair of them. It seemed that she had gotten quite lucky with the security she had to deal tonight, since a pair of them were just standing there, chatting away without a care in the world- the lights attached to their M4’s pointed towards the ground in a truly helpless manner. She walked towards them, the drone above them having gone unnoticed. Marin flanked them, to make sure that they had their backs turned away from her- so she could take off-guard and deal with them quickly*.*



The pair of guard’s were hardly professional about their protection detail, but Marin could hardly blame them. They had been in the woods for around two and half weeks now, protecting the target that claimed that he had a hired assassin after his throat. She had been hired around the same time that they had hunkered down in the forest, but she had needed to attend a rather important cosplay event with her boyfriend, so she had to postpone the assassination, much to her client’s reluctance. It seemed that her procrastination in lieu of the cosplay event had ended up working to her advantage.



Marin slowed to a halt, trying think about how to handle this situation. She had taken it easy on Mr. Potbelly, *well ‘going easy’ was a subjective term, and was entirely up for debate.* She had kept him alive for that long only for the sake of gathering details about the current situation, and she seriously doubted that in the ten minutes that she had spent walking, anything major had changed. She had them by surprise now, but she wouldn’t have them for surprise for long, better to milk it for all its worth.



She moved slowly, each step only worth quarter of the creep she was walking before she spotted the duo. When she was only ten metres away from them, she breath slowly in and began to hold her breath. She walked until was slightly beyond arms reach, and raised her Glock, the end of the suppressor just a few centimetres away, the guard didn’t even have the time to hear the subsonic round leave the chamber.



***Pfft***



The guard pitched forward, whatever he was talking about stopping abruptly. His corpse landed with a loud, heavy thud, his rifle landing to point the light at her legs. For the very first time tonight, the black of her leggings and the blue of her Adidas sneaker were revealed from the darkness of the forest. The alive guard looked down towards his friends and look from his rapidly cooling body to her leggings, to finally meeting the menacing smirk upon her lips. He looked absolutely dumbfounded, and looked like he would piss himself.



“Hey there, big guy.”



***Pfft***



The second guard fell backwards, landing upon the soil with an equally as heavy thud. She lowered her pistol, stepped over their corpses to bend down and turned off the lights that were attached to their weapons, so that they would be hidden by the natural cloak of darkness caused by night. She was also concealed by the night, and so, Marin Kitagawa continued her search for the last fourth guard. She turned her eyes skyward; the small flashing lights of her drone were the only hints of its location. She tapped a few buttons on her phone, and the lights overhead disappeared.

The fourth guard was a little more serious than the previous three, he walked slowly, but with a purpose. He turned his light around with discipline, alert for any sign of a threat, whether that be movement or noise. He also seemed experience with the forest environment, since he didn’t flinch when a wolf howled, or when leave bristled as a doe rushed away in fright. This man, with his autistic-like determination, would be a problem, Marin decided right there and then. She raised her Glock-19 for the fourth time and aimed, calculating the hundred metre distance between herself and her target.



***Pfft***



Just as she twitched, he fingers around the trigger, the guard jerked his body, as if had instinctively known he was about to be shot. He had dodged on just *vibes*, well, he would have dodged her shot if she had aimed for his head. She was a good shot, but shooting someone with a pistol at over a hundred metre? She was no expert markswoman, so she had aimed for an much easier target, the torso. He fell to his knees, clutching his left breast, and pitched forward, falling to the ground. He twitched for a moment, and for a second, she thought him deceased… until he began to crawl. He was alive, but yet he wasn’t screaming in pain, *now that’s just plain weird.*



Marin had no reason to not rush forward, the cabin was just under a kilometre away and the rest of the wandering security guards had been taken care of. Her feet carried her like the wind, and despite herself, she left out a soft chuckle. It felt good to move at not a crawl, it felt good to run, even if for a little. She made it to the fourth guard in about half a minute, pistol aimed at his back and when she stood over him, she understood why he wasn’t screaming bloody murder.



“I shot you lung. I was aiming for your heart, but you kinda moved at the last second, you know? Soz.”



The guard was wheezing, his arm hidden under his chest to stem the rush of blood, although it was to no avail, and the other dug into the grass and soil to get away from her. He wasn’t moving towards the cabin in a futile attempt to warn her target of the coming danger, his mind was solely focused on self-preservation. Although, he would bleed out soon enough, and there was no way that an ambulance could get to him *here*, in a forest in the middle of nowhere. There was also a possibility that he could drown in his own blood before he succumbed to blood loss, which is a pretty nasty way to go in her professional opinion. Marin sighed, no longer aiming her Glock-19 at his exposed back.



“You’re, like tots, gonna bleed out soon, or *worse*. And I so don’t want to waste a bullet that could be better spent, so turn over. I won’t repeat myself, man.”



He stopped, as if to contemplate the truth of her words, and after a few seconds, he pushed himself up with a single hand and managed to turn himself over. His hand stilled covered the blood the flowed from bullet wound upon his left breast, he looked up to her, his breath a struggle, wheeze gurgle. She flicked the switch to turn the safety on the pistol, pulled at the waistband of her leggings and shoved the gun into it. The coolness of the metal made her flinch for a moment, but she tried her best to ignore it. She could have dropped the gun onto the forest ground, but there was a chance that Mr. Wheezer would get ideas, snatch the Glock and shoot her with it. *Not putting it past him to bring us both down, he seems like that kind of sore loser.* She gently placed her blue Adidas sneaker upon his adams apple, before resting her palms upon that knee. She pushed her leg down with all her strength and used her hands to assist in push down further.



***Poop, poop… crack!***



Mr. Wheezer twitch for a few moments, a spittle of bloodied foam leaving his mouth, dribbling down his chin. She lifted her foot, removing it before the red foam could ruin her sneakers. His eyes had a glassy, lifeless quality to them as he gazed up to her, his gaze aimed downward, since the broken neck had changed the angle of his head to slightly dip towards his chest. Marin walked down to where his weapon was, following where the line of whiteness blocked the green view of the forest, bent towards it and turned off the light source. She tapped a view button on the screen and moved the drone to the area she had mark on her map, landing it just a few feet from Mr. Potbelly’s corpse. *I’ll collect both the bag and the drone later,* the girl thought as she pulled up her black shirt and placed the phone into her sports bra. She turned towards the cabin, moving a brisk walk, mentally patting herself on the back for dealing with the roaming guards so thoroughly, and stealthily.



*I’m, like, so good at this. If I fail to make it into cosplay, I should tots make this my full-time career.*

The trees and leaves soon thinned, and in a small clearing a luxurious cabin with freshly lacquered wood stood tall. Within the varying greens of her night vision, Marin was able to spy that there were a few lights on the many windows, however, most of them laid dark, the lights within turned off. 



People were still awake, and that would be the targets personal guards, what was left of them. She would bet the money she would earn from the job that her target was fast asleep, oblivious to what was going to happen in the coming moments. *Let’s get this assassination finished then. I like, really, want to go home and have a shower.*



Slowly, she approached the cabin, walking at a half crouch so that her black clad form would stay hidden from the people within the cabin. It was slow going, but eventually, she made it to the side of the cabin. She pointed the barrel of her pistol to a slightly lowered position, ready to eject a bullet wherever was most lethal. 



The girl slowly walked forward, each footstep silent, with the side of the cabin to her left.  As she got closer to the front of the cabin, she could hear the soft noise of music. The fast strums of an electric guitar, and the loud screeching of a female rock and roll singer, was a clear message that someone was up ahead.



Marin, already half-crouching, lowered herself to a crawl, and continued forward. She stopped when she was up against a wooden porch, hidden behind its ledge. The music was loud, and she stealthily moved her head up to peak above the ledge. Marin spied a man sitting in an expensive grey lounge chair, nodding away at the music, playing the air guitar. The front door was next to him, and the light spilled out greedily, fighting back the night. She frowned, her night vision useless once more, and pulled up the goggles attached to her forehead so she could get a clearer view. She moved her body so that she was squatting, her knees just a few centimetres away from the side of the porch. Marin leant the bottom of the suppressor against the wooden edge of the veranda, twitched her finger.



***Pfft***



“…Grrrk…”



The subsonic round pierced the side of his skull, throwing his head against the curved side of the chair. His arms went limp, falling to his lap where his M4 rested, and blood sprayed, staining the material of the seat. Using her hands, she quietly, and *slowly*, pulled herself over the edge of the porch and belly-crawled along the wooden planks. She heard footsteps from inside, and the girl went still, her Glock pointed upwards, aimed at the air.



“Hey, Subaru, turn that music dow- what the?”



A man with brown hair exited through the front door, a rather nasty looking M16 slung over his shoulder. He looked at the cooling corpse of his co-worker and looked towards the floor of the porch, his eyes widened like plate when he caught side of her blonde hair, and the small smirk upon her lips. Although Marin supposed that the suppressed Glock-19 pointed at his head was the cause of her shock, and not her unordinary beauty.



***Pfft***



“Wai- hrrk…”



The muzzle of the suppressor flashed, and the soft ‘tang’ of the shell hitting the wood of the porch echoed softly. His plea for mercy was cut short as the lead bullet entered through his forehead, exiting through the back of his skull, and digging a hole into the wooden wall of the cabin near the door. He stood still for a second, just enough time for Marin to debate sending a second bullet into his chest. However, her doubts were erased when he pitched forwards, toppling over the wooden planks of the porch and falling down the stairs that lead into the cabin, only stopping when his head touched the grass below. The music continued to play, and waited a couple moments, expecting another guard to check put what had occurred. No one came, and so Marin slowly stood to a half crouch. She creeped forward, ready to enter the cabin and finish her job so that she could go home. Only to stop and contemplate the rifle that rested upon the guard’s lap.



*I’ve gone quiet all night… there’s only four guards and the target left, it’s sooooo time to let loose.*

She pulled at the waistband of her leggings, flipped the safety of her Glock for the second time that night and felt the cool touch of metal once more. She swiped the rifle from the guard’s lifeless arms and found that the safety had already been flipped off. She stood up fully, and confidently walked through the front door.



***Bang***



Her trigger finger twitched, and a bullet tore through a guard that was sitting upon the couch, a steaming cup of coffee sat upon the small glass table in front of him. He was thrown back in his seat, the white dress shirt-stained red like a freshly bloomed flower. Marin heard footsteps come done the hall and pointed the barrel of the M4 towards the empty entrance of the hallway.



*Three to go...*



“Don’t go shooting stuff, Hiro. Any damage will be coming out of your pay once this jo is done.”

She waited. And a few moments later, her prey came. A tall man with a blading head and a shirt that was a few sizes too small, emphasising his muscular physique walked calmly through the hallway, only to stop three metres away from her. At this distance she couldn’t really miss, especially since she was taking this so seriously. She had taken them off-guard, and now it was time to take full advantage. Mr. Muscles flinched, his hand gripping to the handgun holstered at her side. However, his flinching had delayed him, costing him a precious few seconds- and she already had the muzzle of her rifle pointed at his chest.



“Nuh-huh\~”



***Bang. Bang.***



The guard had flinched last second, and his belly had received two shots of hot lead instead of his chest. Mr. Muscles clutched his wounded abdomen, screaming bloody murder as he struggled to maintain standing. He had managed to unholster his gun, but he had dropped it when he had been shot, and the weapon had landed at his feet. The girl walked forward, roughly shoving him into the wall with her shoulder. Normally he would have remained standing, due their weight difference… but wounded, and barely standing, she had managed to make him fall. His back hit the wall, and he began to slide down slowly, a trail of blood left in his wake. With her heel, she kicked the pistol into the living room, the weapon stopping under the same couch as Mr. Coffee. With his weapon out of his reach and lethally wounded, she deemed his threat minimal and kept moving.



She moved with haste, but she made sure to be extra careful. Now’s the moment where she’s at most risk. Her element of surprise had allowed her to take care of eight of the guards… but that left two more. She couldn’t take them by surprise any longer. She left Mr. Muscles to groan to himself, and walked down the hall, only to hear the sound of rushing water. She stopped before a white door that led into the sound and leaned against the edge of the wall. She stretched her hand, twisted the doorknob and roughly slammed it inwards.



“Fuck you!”



***Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.***



 A hail of bullets rushed through the door, slamming into the wall in front of it. Plaster was sprayed everywhere, covering the hallway in a cloud of white dust. The storm of bullets continued for two more seconds, before it was abruptly halted by a deafening click. An *empty* magazine. However, the guard may have a sidearm, so Marin awkwardly moved her rifle so that the barrel was pointed within the bathroom whilst she was hidden behind the corner, out of his firing range. She twitched her trigger, releasing it swiftly- she repeated this motion four time.



***Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.***



A loud, high-pitched scream echoed against the walls of the hall after the second shot. However, she continued her onslaught for two more rounds, pointing the barrel down slightly with the third and fourth shot- just to be sure that the girl had got him. She released a breath she didn’t know she had been holding, only to flinch when the plaster behind her erupts like a volcano science project she did in middle school. A loud bang followed an instant later, and on instinct alone, she gripped the edge of the bathroom doorway, and pulled herself through, falling face first onto the tiled floor. She landed just a few centimetres away from the black sneakers of a corpse clothed in a white dress shirt and black pants, with the shirt having three blossoming flowers of red scattered amongst the fabric.



A moment after she had cleared the doorway, a rapid fire of bullets pierced the wall, slamming into the tiled wall behind her. Marin stayed low, repositioning herself so that she faced the doorway, instead of having her back to it. When the gunfire stopped, her ears picked up the sound of a magazine being ejected from a rifle. She crawled upon her belly as fast as she could, the borrowed M4 in latex-clad hands pointed down the hall. A head, torso and an Ak-47 widely out from an open doorway, just two rooms down the hall. His weapon was pointed at where her chest was… if she had been standing just like he was now.



“Down here, asshole.”



***Bang. Bang. Bang.***



The first bullet tore into his chest, the second into his shoulder, and the last one found its way into his left eye. His head exploded into a violent display of gore, blood splattering across the open door behind him. He fell backwards, slamming into the doorway before sliding against the door and landed into the hallway with a wet thud, a pool of blood spreading beneath him. He twitched for a few moments before becoming still, and with a grunt of effort, she forced herself up and began to slowly walk done the hall once more. There was a stillness in the air, only broken by the groaning of Mr. Muscles behind her. Carefully, she avoided the pool of blood that spilled out into the hallway, but whilst her attention was waned, she heard a low battle cry coming from the side.



She saw the glint of metal, and a large, fatty arm bringing a large steak knife down upon her with a fury she rarely got to see up close… since normally she killed her targets from a distance. However, her body moved on its own, as she reacted with *instinct*, instead of forethought of her action s, and raised the M4 in her hands to block the knife. The edge of the blade grinded against the hand-guard rail, finding purchase in one of the many indents upon the texture surface. In a calculated effort, Marin twisted the weapon around and pulled it to the side, she managed to disarm her attacker, and in doing so, she heard metal upon flesh. The butt of the rifle had slammed into the fat man’s wrist whilst she had parried his strike. She let go of the gun, and moved inwards, her feet stepping into the pool of blood, the soles of her adidas shoes being soiled for the first time tonight. She pulled back a leg, and sent it into his knee, hearing a loud crack a moment later.



“Arrck! Aaahh!”



Now off-balance, she pushed him by his flabby shoulder’s as hard she could, barely managing to maintain her own sense of balance upon the slick surface of the bloody floor.  With his knee broken and the blood beneath him, the man slipped and fell upon his back with a heavy thud that echoed across the hallway. Groaning, Marin was able to get a good look at her assailant for the first time. He was incredible fat, and wore a large ratty shirt stained with tomato sauce and gravy, and a pair of sttripped blue and white pyjama pants that were thoroughly stained with the life blood of the guard she had just killed. This was her target- the reason why she had been hired to kill ten guards. With a dreary sigh, the girl pulled at the waistband of her black leggings, reaching for the handle of her suppressed Glock-19.



“Wait. Wait! Whatever that bitch is paying you, I can pay you double. N-no, triple!”



She pulled the pistol out of its improvised sheath and pointed it at his chest in an almost relaxed manor, as if she wasn’t about to murder this fat man. As if she hadn’t spent the night doing the same thing to ten different men.



“Sorry, I’m not in the business to do refunds. Though, like, totally send me a postcard from hell when you can.”



***Pfft. Pfft. Pfft.***



Two shots to the chest, and a final shot to the forehead shut up his scared, pained whimpers. He stilled, the carpet of the bedroom floor drenched with blood of both the target and his final guard. The blood splatter covered the entire entrance, and she needed to go inside the room to receive the files that her client had requested.



“Urgh. Now I have to buy new shoes.”



The girl walked into the room, carefully stepping over the bodies of the guard and the target, she scouted the bedroom. An expensive looking bed, with a bedside table and a fashionable lamp placed upon it. A desk was placed in the corner of the room, and a large walk-in rested next to the bed. The target’s phone was placed on the bedside table with the lightning cable attached to the charging port.



“Bingo\~.”



Marin giggled whilst she pulled up her shirt, reached into her sports bra and fished out a flash drive designed for IOS devices from her cleavage. She walked over to the table, placed her pistol upon the wooden material and unplugged the iphone. She then plugged in her flash drive into its charging port and tapped the screen with her index finger- only to find it locked.



“Hmm, of course it has a password.”



She walked back to the target’s corpse and bent down. She grabbed a meaty hand and wiped the blood on it away with the soiled cloth of his pyjama pants. Once it was clean-ish, she moved his hand closer and tried four fingers before she had unlocked his smart phone. Now that Marin had access to his files, she hummed a tune softly as she walked away from the target and sat upon the messed-up bed. She tapped away at the screen, finding the relevant files and begun the process of downloading them onto the connected flash drive. The entire process took about seven minutes; two for finding the relevant files that the client requested and five for a full download.



Once the files had been copied and downloaded onto the flash drive, she retrieved her Glock from the bedtable and walked out of the room, stepping over the bodies of the target and his dead guard. She walked down the hall, past the bathroom and stopped in front of Mr. Muscles, who was still groaning in pain with a large pool of blood beath him, his hands covering his belly wound as if it would somehow stop his lifeblood seeping out from his flesh. He was near death, and would probably die within five to ten minutes, but Marin didn’t like to leave anything to chance.



“Open your mouth.”



He barely raised his head, lacking in energy, and for a second, Marin doubted that he was even capable of understanding her. However, after a couple of seconds, Mr. Muscles obeyed, and without a shred of hesitation, she forced the barrel of the suppressor into his mouth. He gagged as the suppressor reached the back of his throat, making the suppressor slick with blood and spit. Marin closed her eyes and gave him a sweet smile.



“Night night, Mr. Muscles. Sleep well.”



***Pfft***



She pulled the gun out from his lips, and Mr. Muscles fell limply to the side. *Dead*. Marin wiped the suppressor upon the clean cloth of the shoulder of his dress shirt. The girl walked out of the house and was greeted with darkness once more. She flipped her night vision goggles over her eyes and walked into the night. She needed to retrieve her drone from Mr. Potbelly, and of course, frame the whole assassination on the taxi driver she had promised to pay.

1jith6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1jith6f/sutab_fail/,Sutab Fail,"Seeking an explanation or someone else who's had both type preps. I've had four scopes, and used the liquid prep 3 times without fail. I was forced to use Sutab this time, due to flying. 

I'm an active 63 year old male, who walks extensively each day, for a couple of hours, if not more. 6-8 miles a day, as I'm retired, and enjoy the relaxing feeling. I recognize this causes some occasional constipation, and drink lots of water. My diet is a routine of yogurt and eggs for breakfast, salads with chicken, and some home made shredded chicken and refried beans burritos. I'm an occasional snacker, with a medium bag of potato chips normally inducing a greasy laxative effect. 

I had a 1:30 PM Friday colonoscopy, and sutab failed me miserably. 

Monday, Tues I ate salads, and did my rigorous walks. Apples, a burrito or two, eggs. Regular BM's on regular schedule. 

Weds, flew to my hospital city. Two cups coffee with cream, snack of cheese nips, ginger cookies on flight, chicken salad on lettuce lunch, large salad with chicken at 7PM w Ranch, and two snack bags of chips. Had BM mid day. Took long walk during day. 

Per instructions started drinking lots of water Thursday AM, 100 ounces. No food at all. Regular BM. Went for my walk. Water drinking on top of water. I did feel bloated from the water, and a bit constipated after the walk, but felt like Sutab being soon, all would be okay.

Started Surab at 5pm, as instructed. As instructed, drank 32 ounces (more is better, per instructions) ""I hour after Sutab""; however, the Sutab kicked in after 45 minutes. I hope I was okay drinking water while pooping. Liquid poop for 4 or so BM's, then everything shut down like I was done. Dark diarrhea, liquid. Peeing like every 10 minutes. 

Sutab second phase, midnight, same procedure. This time I was able to drink the ""32 ounces"" of water before pooping, and I tried to hold off BM thinking the longer I waited, the better the Sutab would work.

This is where it gets interesting. I had 3 BM's of liquid brown getting lighter, high volume, then one yellow. Shut down after 30 minutes. Then 15 minutes later, I made myself start again. 2-3 lesser volume, but brown again, but the very last, a lot of gas, then about a quart of totally clear. Was drinking water constantly thinking it would ""go through me"". Instead, all I did was pee. 

Severe cramps, about 5-6AM, and still peeing like crazy. 

Went to get colonoscopy at 1:30 PM, and was not totally clean, but procedure was performed under ""sub-optimal conditions""....

Did I do something wrong, as I felt like I'd eaten a light diet all week, hydrated, and followed the Sutab instructions given by the doctor.

1jitfw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Male_Enhancement_Pill/comments/1jitfw7/old_man_secret_gave_him_power_to_act/,Old Man Secret gave Him Power to Act,"The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Central Park as John slumped on a weathered wooden bench, his broad shoulders hunched forward like a fallen boxer after ten rounds. At 32, he had what should have been confidence - a decent finance job, an apartment in Brooklyn, and a gym-toned body that showed through his fitted shirt. Yet here he sat, watching happy couples stroll by while his phone showed yet another unanswered dating app message.

""Maybe I'm just broken,"" he muttered to a passing squirrel that didn't even pause to judge him.

The bench creaked as an old man settled beside him without invitation. Dressed in a brown corduroy jacket that smelled faintly of pipe tobacco and something earthy, he looked like a retired professor who'd wandered out of a Woody Allen movie. His gnarled hands, dotted with age spots and what might have been an old Navy tattoo, cradled a small cedar box.

""Son, you're carrying the weight of the world on those shoulders,"" the stranger observed in a voice like gravel and honey. ""And I'd bet my last dollar it's not about money.""

Something about those keen blue eyes made John's defenses crumble. He found himself confessing everything - the way his throat closed up when attractive women spoke to him, the panic that set in when dates leaned in for a kiss, the humiliating retreat to the bathroom during what should have been intimate moments.

The old man listened while carving a small figure from what looked like ginseng root. When John finished, he produced a velvet pouch from his jacket. Inside lay dried herbs that released an aroma like an Appalachian forest after rain - rich, mysterious, and oddly comforting.

""My Cherokee grandmother called this 'warrior's blend',"" he said, rubbing the leaves between thumb and forefinger. ""Not for fighting battles, but for winning the war inside."" He spoke of ancestral knowledge - how Native healers and early settlers used combinations like saw palmetto for masculine energy, maca root for vitality, and hawthorn berry for courage.

""But nowadays?"" He chuckled, producing a sleek modern bottle from his pocket. ""Science finally caught up with what the earth always knew."" The label read[ **Mountain Oak Confidence Blend** ](https://www.vigrxplus.com/ct/944321?t1=oldman)\- an advanced adaptogenic formula combining those ancient herbs with bioavailable compounds.

As John examined the bottle, a sudden breeze carried the scent of blooming magnolias from across the park. When he looked up, the bench beside him stood empty except for a single white feather resting where the old man had sat.

The next month played out like a dream. After taking the capsules daily, John noticed subtle shifts first - holding eye contact with the stunning barista at his local coffee shop, then laughing effortlessly at a coworker's joke instead of overanalyzing it. By week three, women in his yoga class began ""accidentally"" unrolling their mats near his.

Now, six months later, his dating profile stays inactive not from fear, but because he keeps meeting women organically - at bookstores, during morning runs, even in line at Whole Foods. The transformation wasn't about becoming someone else, but uncovering who he'd always been beneath the layers of doubt.

**Time-Sensitive Update:**

John recently tried to reorder his supply only to discover **Mountain Oak Naturals** is facing an FDA inquiry (convenient timing, right?). The last remaining stock is disappearing faster than whiskey at a frat party.

He bought a six-month supply. Smart man.

Will you spend another year wondering ""what if""... or take action before this option vanishes?

Am I overqualified?,"I know this is stupid especially in this job market, but I hate my office job. I dreamed of this position for a long time, but then realized that with office work, you have to deal with the disorganization and the attitude and the spontaneity, etc. I got burned out after 3 months and now I am ready to quit, as my boss is extremely disorganized and has zero concept of time, but me being the manager means that I have to take the backlash for his lack of responsibility from the customers. 

I realized that as a neurodivergent person, I like jobs where I can just do, and I don't have to think. My weekend job is as a barista, and I worked as a barista for several years before that. I loved it because I just had a simple checklist of tasks and knew exactly what to do in every situation. The thing is, would listing this professional job on my resume make me look overqualified if I apply to barista jobs? This isn't a local starbucks or a low-level chain coffee shop, but a local-owned coffee shop that doubles as a wellness center. I heard that listing the job may make some employers see that you are versatile and have strong conflict resolution skills, but to other employers, you may look overqualified. I really want to work at this specific place and will include as much specification as I can in my cover letter, however I know that the resume is often viewed first and want to make sure that I don't screw up my chances.

2025 was *rough*—got laid off, broke my leg in a nasty fall, and faced a ton of setbacks. After a month-long delay (and a mountain of coffee), I’m stoked to share this labor of love with you all!

**The vibe behind the game:**  
It all started as an inside joke with my old coworkers. Back in China, we’d sneak out every afternoon for “**mō yú**” breaks (slang for slacking off—literally “petting fish” 🐟). We’d bond over boba tea and daydream about turning those chill, cheeky escapes into a game… and here we are!

**Why it’s special:**  
Yes, it’s multiplayer, but it’s **100% cozy-core**—no stress, just vibes. Think of it as hanging out with friends in parallel, but with aquariums, silly inside jokes, and the joy of doing *absolutely nothing* together. 🌿☁️

1jitbz6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jitbz6,Life goes on! AMA,"In retrospect, the gastric sleeve part of my life only lasted for so long before it became an afterthought (I tell myself as I sip protein coffee and munch on the same nut snack bar for the last 20 minutes). The months leading up to the surgery, having the surgery, slight complications, and learning how to live life afterwards.  In total 2-ish years? Has it been an easy ride? Most days, yes, but in those low moments, it felt like eternity. Before the surgery, no one talked about how much I was eating, but after? I became center of attention when I fixed my tiny bowl of food. I hated how everyone felt my weight was okay to talk about now in front of me, rather than behind my back like so many did before. I still hate it, but I've learned how to redirect the conversation and not be resentful towards people who don't understand. I learned how to enjoy conversation with family and friends that didn't revolve around needing food or alcohol sitting in front of me. I've learned how to love my body for everything it has done for me despite the years of abuse I put it through. 
Just over 2 years out, I barely weigh 100lbs and never thought I would look at myself some days and wonder if I am too skinny. I never thought I would ask if a pair of jeans I wanted came in a size 00. 9/10x I still only buy my clothes second hand, because on some level I'm still unable to accept that my ""fat-girl"" pants are a size 2.  
I started dating someone who was actually flirting with me and wasn't just trying to sleep with me. I still cringe sometimes at the thought of him seeing my undressed body, but then he pulls me closer and kisses in all the areas I hate and I'm reminded that those areas are a part of who I am and got me here today. My boobs used to be my favorite part of my body, now i just roll them sucker's up like teenage girl stuffing her bra with socks. Now, i love the feel of my hip bones. My HIP BONES. My son and I shaved our heads two weeks ago and it is, hands down, my favorite part of this weight loss journey so far. I was so scared at first, but literally after having this surgery what little hair i had left was lifeless and dead. I've never been told by anyone, much less complete strangers, that I was pulling something off... twice now I've been told my shaved head looks really good. Going to the gym wasn't for me.  It's boring, repetitive, and i felt like a failure for not loving my workouts.  I felt like the fat girl in me was making me hate it and it made me think i was being lazy. I would get up and go, but was bored from doing the same thing over and over.  So, instead of letting my inner dialog win, i thought back to what used to bring me joy - skateboarding.  But, that was always social for me and I'm not really that girl anymore.  So i started doing some research and found myself a new challenge. I picked up Freeline Skating and I'm loving being active again (also you should look up freeline skating if you don't know what it is).  I still actively attend therapy. I still have a lot to work on, but it's no longer all weight centered grief or no longer anything i can blame on my weight.  I have to face my issues now, no excuses.  AMA.

1jita2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Male_Enhancement_Pill/comments/1jita2v/shy_boy/,Shy boy,"Mark closed his eyes as the wind brushed against his muscular arms after his morning run. Every day started the same way – a workout at dawn, precisely measured protein, a mirror reflecting a perfect physique. But whenever he imagined someone's touch, his hands clenched into fists. He wasn't afraid of his size – his doctor always said everything was normal during check-ups. He was afraid of what happened in his mind every time the moment of truth approached.

He remembered that night a year ago when Agata, his high school sweetheart, ran into him at a reunion. They laughed like old times, her hand accidentally brushed against his thigh, and he... invented a sudden migraine attack. He bolted from the restaurant, leaving her alone at the table, confusion in her eyes.

The gym became his sanctuary. There, under the weight of the barbell, he could prove to himself that he was enough. But whenever his buddies suggested going out, he made excuses. ""Not in the mood,"" ""Got an important project,"" ""Maybe next time.""

One rainy evening, while browsing a sports psychology forum, he stumbled upon a deleted thread titled ""Atlas Syndrome – Why a Strong Body Doesn’t Heal a Weak Mind."" Inside, he found the story of a former marathon runner who described his experiences with [**this remedy**](https://www.vigrxplus.com/ct/944321?t1=Shy%20boy) – a treatment combining cutting-edge neuroplasticity research with adaptogenic herbs used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine.

He noticed the first changes after a week. He woke up feeling as if someone had lifted an invisible weight off his chest. A girl at the café asked him to pass the sugar – a normal situation – but this time, he didn’t avoid eye contact. Her smile didn’t seem mocking, just... genuine.

A month later, he met Marta from work for coffee. When their hands touched, he didn’t hold his breath. When she talked about her passion for rock climbing, he didn’t overanalyze every word. He just *was*.

1jita21,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentsph/comments/1jita21/its_so_hard_to_save_these_days/,It's so hard to save these days 😭,"Hello po. Before anyone invalidates how I feel, I know that others have it harder than me po pero please let me share this muna. 

I live in a different city from my university so it's an hour or two na byahe, that is IF I chose to spend less than 50 pesos. Kaso lang, hindi ko kaya yung gumising ng 4 para umalis ng 5 for my 7:30 class (I always have travel time allowance para iwas late). ""Kayanin mo OP."" Sorry poo. it's too early for me and I tend to fall asleep in class if kulang tulog ko, which is a big no-no since I'm an engineering student. I'm also scared kasi jeep yun tapos andaming nakaw cases and I alwayss fall asleep kapag commuting that long.

Now, may better option where 30min lang ang byahe. But total amount for fare is umaabot ng 80. Pero with this, I have better sleep, plus, hindi ako nag woworry ng traffic and nakakakain pa ako ng breakfast before leaving. This is going to school. Pag pauwi naman, fixed 80 pesos yung fare. No other options na talaga huhu. 

And then there's food, meals and snacks. Before you say anything, I have a big appetite. If hindi ako mabubusog sa meal ko, I'll get hungry minutes later tapos pag nalipasan ng gutom, hyperacidity agad (tama ba to? Basta sumasakit tiyan ko tas ayaw kona tuloy kumain the whole day). ANG MAHAL NA NG MGA PAGKAIN PRAMIS 😭😭. Yung breadstix na maliit tag 10 na. 5 lang yung noon eeee. Hindi ako nabubusog sa 50 pesos for my meals. I have to spend anywhere close to 80. Tas yung schedule ko is from morning until evening everyday, so lunch and dinner binibili ko, plus snacks pa. Remember, palipas ng gutom is a nono for me so kapag nagugutom, dapat talaga akong kumain. 

Eto approximation ng nagagastos ko everyday:
Commute back n forth - 160
Meals - 140 (let's say 70 yung meal)
Snacks - remaining sa money 

My family's not that well off so I always try to save for my needs or wants na ata to, like skincare (just moisturizer, cleanser, serum, and sunscreen) and makeup (light make up wearer lang me), and yung mga bayarin for schoolworks or projects. 

My dad has been scolding me for not saving much pero he's the one who's been telling me to always buy food if I'm hungry kasi I have the money naman daw. Pa, ang mahal na ng mga foodies as in 😩. Naiinggit ako sa cms ko na nakakapag coffee pag gusto nila, fave kopa naman ung coffee huhu. 

Eyon lang po. Gusto kolang magpalabas ng aking hinanakit of being a broke college student.

He owned that view—just like he owned the corner office at the hedge fund, the Italian leather shoes, the effortless charm that made heads turn at Manhattan cocktail parties.

But none of it mattered at 2:37 AM.

The number pulsed behind his eyelids like a bad neon sign: **four**. Four pathetic inches that turned him into a coward every time things got real. He'd perfected the art of the escape—sudden work calls, fake emergencies, once even pretending to faint in a girl's bathroom. The walk of shame had nothing on the Uber ride of humiliation he took home each time.

His last date still burned in his memory. Sophia, all legs and laughter, pulling him into her Brooklyn loft. Then that awful hitch in her breath when she saw. The way her manicured fingers had hesitated mid-air before patting his shoulder like he was some sad, broken thing.

*""It's okay, we don't have to—""*

He'd left his favorite jacket there in his rush to disappear.

The discovery happened in the bleary-eyed hours between midnight and regret. Some Reddit thread buried under financial analysts arguing about Bitcoin. Three words that made his pulse spike: **""It actually grows.""**

[**This wasn't another scam**](https://www.vigrxplus.com/ct/944321?t1=TheWeightofFourInches). No pumps, no surgeries, no sketchy injections. Just ancient Amazonian herbs and some Nobel Prize-winning peptide science, bottled into unassuming capsules. The before-and-after photos made his throat tight—real men, real results, measuring tapes don't lie.

**Week Two:**  
He woke up with an erection so fierce it startled him. The bathroom mirror showed subtle changes—fuller, heavier, *alive* in a way that made him stare. That morning, his barista (the one with the snake tattoos he'd been too nervous to flirt with) lingered while handing him coffee. *""You look... different.""*

**Month One:**  
His tailor frowned at his suit pants, measuring tape looping twice. *""You been squatting, Mr. Carter?""* The locker room at Equinox became a parade of sidelong glances and poorly hidden curiosity. He stopped rushing to change.

**Month Three:**  
Sophia ran into him at a SoHo gallery opening. Her gaze dropped, lingered, then snapped back up with parted lips. *""Daniel?""* Like she was seeing him for the first time. Later, against her bedroom wall, she gasped something in Italian that needed no translation.

Now the pills gather dust in his medicine cabinet. He doesn't need them anymore.

But you?

You're still checking your reflection in elevator doors. Still engineering dates that never make it to the bedroom. Still lying awake wondering *what if.*

The lab can only make so much. The FDA's already sniffing around. And men like Daniel? They're buying six months' supply at a time.

Tick-tock.

I’m down to 100kg in 5 weeks. I feel more energetic. I’m thinking as clearly as 20 years ago. 

After week 2 I stopped being hungry. Eating once a day, and full on fasting at least 2 times a week. This week eating every other day. I only eat when I’m hungry and that’s not often. 

As a full blown alcy I can’t go cold turkey. But from big ole Hefeweizens and old fashioneds all night to Michelob ultra and a couple scotches. 

What I’ve noticed is that my body is on full engine mode. Everything that goes in gets burned out. 

Week 3 I was still drinking like before. Heavily. And I stopped having hangovers. Usually I’d have at least 6 hours of discomfort. But I was waking up like nothing happened. After a cup of coffee right as rain. That’s unheard of for me. 

Week 4 and 5. The booze won’t even hit me. It’s pointless to have drinks. I switched over to edibles and maybe one beer and one whiskey, just for the taste.

1jit2wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/1jit2wf/in_defense_of_electronic_typewriters/,In defense of electronic typewriters,"I wrote this epic reply in another thread and thought it was too good to leave buried. Bear in mind that it's all in good fun so no offense intended to any manual typewriter purists who might see my opinion as an affront to common decency. After all, in a healthy society opinions are meant to be challenged, and popular opinions most of all. So without further ado...

=====

Sorry to be a contrarian here, but I don't agree at all with the anti-electronic consensus.

Manual typewriters are awesome, no question about it. I love them. I grew up with an old 1930s Royal office machine in the house, I own an Optima Elite 2, a '60s space-age-looking Royal portable (branded as Cole/Litton) that is in pieces in an ill-advised attempt to repair the escapement, and a delightful Kmart-btanded Brother JP-1 that I can't use because my housemate's son messed up something inside, but that's beside the point. I even had a blue BuddyL plastic kids typewriter when I was little. I love manual typewriters.

The biggest issues I have with them are 1) they're scarcer than they used to be and often expensive to buy, especially since they became trendy and collectible; 2) as aging mechanical devices they can break, wear out, go out of adjustment, etc., and repairs (by a dwindling number of qualified repair people using a dwindling supply of spare parts) are likely going to be expensive and involve shipping; 3) they're popular, everyone has one,  my impression is that users tend to be a bit snobbish about having one, and if there's one thing I hate it's anything that everyone agrees is cool, which by definition makes it uncool.

Coolness (in the social/cultural sense) doesn't factor into my love of typewriters. Utility and affordability do. My criteria are: does a given device do the job I need it to do, and can I afford to own it? Because if I can't afford it, I can't use it. Enter the humble and unloved electronic typewriter.

They're as common as head lice on first graders. Walk into any thrift store, chances are they have at least one or two for $10 each, lightly to moderately used and probably still with a ribbon and maybe the owners manual inside the lid. More than likely it still works. They usually have outlets somewhere nearby to plug in and perform a quick test. If it works, take it home and start typing. If it conks out on you, strip any usable parts (ribbon, type wheel, etc) and toss it out, plenty more where that came from. If it keeps ticking, keep typing. That's the whole point of having a typewriter, isn't it?

For the collector in you, there are in fact ways to have fun with these pieces of plastic garbage. Smith Corona type 5A machines for instance are like weeds, they're everywhere. But the fun part is that they were sold in a gazillion different model names, some specific to certain retailers, with varying  combinations of features on the same basic design. I'd argue that if you're of that persuasion there's some satisfaction to be found looking for an uncommon or rare variant. Since nobody gives a crap about them rarities can be had cheaply. Hunting for hard to find typeface wheels can be interesting too. It's a hobby, it's supposed to be fun!

Many electronic typewriters are in fact cheap badly designed junk. The lowest end SC 5A's with simple plastic bales are nothing to write home about when trying to line the paper up, but they do the job reasonably well. Others are better. Look for those instead. Mid-level 5A's aren't too bad in my opinion. Brother AX and CE machines are great. I have several of both.

Objections and rebuttals:

They're ugly! They're electronic! They're plastic! They're basically nothing but computer keyboards with a daisy wheel printer attached! Of course they are. Get over it.

They have no soul or personality! Umm, yeah...they are mass-produced consumer products, like all typewriters and many other objects of enthusiast desire.

But they're based on microchips! Try this: go to one of the stompbox subreddits, ask a guitarist to explain the varying levels of mojo in overdrive pedals based on the 4558 dual op amp chip and why the JRC variant is the ONLY good one; or the soulful tone quality of  ""orange drop"" capacitors, or the endearing catankerousness of leaky vintage germanium transistors in fuzz pedals. Not saying a microprocessor in a 1980s plastic wedge has soul, but you may find the intersection of electronic components and perceived human-like qualities an interesting topic for discussion.

They're unreliable! Actually, there's relatively little inside to go wrong, and they're simple enough that you may be able to fix them yourself if you have a crapped-out unit that you can cannibalize for parts. Fried motherboard? Strip the parts and move on to the next one in your stash. Bad keys? It may be as simple as an alcohol.swab to some contacts. Sticky carriage rail? A little 3-in-1 oil. Stripped gears? That's your call. But I wager if you're reasonably gentle with your wedge it'll work fine for a good long while. When it does die, no big loss, strip it and chuck it.

You can't take it on a hike/to the park/to the coffee shop! Get a manual machine for that. Or try handwriting. But don't get too upset if you accidentally dump a fresh caramel macchiato into.your Hermes 3000.

You can't use it during a power outage! Seriously? I'd say you have more pressing things to worry about during an outage than writing. And if it's at night, even a manual won't be of much use.

They type slow! You're a professional typist or coder? You're on a deadline? I thought part of the appeal of mechanical writing implements is that they force you to slow down and think before you write.

No one will take me seriously if they see me with one! You need new friends, preferably ones who aren't as into typewriters as you are, or not so judgemental in general.

They're not desirable or collectible! Wait ten years for Gen Alpha hipsters to ""discover"" them. Have your eBay seller account ready to go.

You can't find ribbons for them! Have you tried looking? Even lesser known brands are reasonably easy to.source ribbons for. Google ribbons for SC (""H series"" for 5A and other models) and Brother and you'll find at least a couple dozen sellers.

I just don't like them! Fair enough. You don't have to like them. My point is, you don't have to hate them either.

You also don't have to agree with anything I've said. But I figured someone needed to step up and advocate for these much maligned machines, unpopular as that position might be. There's something irresistible to me about cheering on the underdog, and for going against the grain of conventional ""wisdom"". Besides, as I said, this is supposed to be a fun activity.  Use whatever you like, use whatever you can get your hands on, and use the hell out of it, whether it's mechanical or electronic.

I struggle to advocate for myself in medical settings so in the past I'd neglected to get even the most ""basic"" accommodations, like laying down or making sure I ate beforehand.

But today I did it! 
I brought my supportive partner with me and that was huge. I scheduled for a slow day so I wouldn't feel rushed. 
Here's what helped: 

- let the phlebotomist know about my issues  beforehand
- reclined chair 
- no looking!!! (I sometimes feel the need to even though I know I shouldn't) 
- prescription lidocaine ointment on inside of arm 30min before appointment. Let it sit and try not to rub it in. 
- fidget toy (compression/squish style) 
- eat and drink plenty the night before and morning of. Had a small amount of coffee. 
- Hot shower and yoga to help get my blood pressure regulated 
- took hydroxyzine in the morning to help with anxiety
- had conversation topics planned with partner for during the blood draw. 

I had two vials taken, and it went well! I felt fuzzy afterwards and had to sit for a few minutes, but I did not pass out. The process took less than 5 mins total. This is a big milestone for me! 

I realize the list above is extensive, but I think every piece contributed to my success. Feel free to ask any questions. I'm celebrating with pokemon cards :)

I discovered I had Aphantasia a few years before and fortunately at some point in between, watched that Wired UK documentary on YT about the guy who lost his mum and then his siblings thought he was a psychopath because he had so little grief - turns out, for him, aphantasia really reduced the grief impact of her dying. 

Fearing a similar impact and knowing chemo wasn't winning the battle for Dad, I decided that when I was calling around to hang out with him, I'd bring a little digital voice recorder and put it on the coffee table, even if all we were doing was watching a football game on TV. I also started to take far more photographs than ever before. 

Like the guy in the documentary, I haven't struggled much with grief, never plagued with with visual memories or flashes of reminders of Dad, but thankfully, if I want to, I can sit on my own, pop in some headphones and just re-experience our time together and it's great for bringing up my emotional connection. 

Has anyone else stumbled over ways of how aphantasia impacts grief and some of the pitfalls or potential tricks for dealing grief as an aphantasiac?",5,1742829202.0,Aphantasia,0,1.0,False

And if history repeats itself, very few people will actually go cast a ballot. In the recent bond election last year, about 6 percent of the city’s registered voters went to the polls. In 2023, when every seat (including the mayor’s) was on the ballot, turnout was around 7 percent. In 2019, the city hit a high score of 12 percent—that was the year we had nine candidates for mayor. City and school board elections are the things that have a significant impact on our day-to-day lives: every pothole that rattles your travel coffee mug, traffic signal that blanks out when it rains, lengthy wait for a police officer to arrive at a crime scene, and so on are directly related to who we choose to run the city. 
One of the things that readers mentioned to me during several election cycles is that it’s hard to find a comprehensive source of information about local candidates. So we’ve created what we believe is a one-stop shop for voters. As we update it, you’ll be able to find each candidate’s website, their endorsements, the big names donating to their campaign, and links to forums, questionnaires, and interviews they’ve participated in, plus some they may participate in at a later date. It’s all searchable by district, too, and includes city council and school board district maps and a link to information on registering to vote. (You’ll need to do that by April 3.) To see the candidates in a specific district, use the drop down menu.
We also had some criteria for endorsements. You won’t see every endorsement—that’s what the candidates’ websites are for. What you will see are endorsements from people who previously held that seat, plus endorsements from major publications, unions, organizations, and political action committees.
Check it out, and let us know what you think.

1jit07g,https://www.reddit.com/r/absentgrandparents/comments/1jit07g/where_are_this_generations_grandparents/,Where are this generations grandparents?,"My in-laws turned 67 years old recently. They now receive SS and Medicaid. Their lives have been easy thus far. 

Both born in 1958, and received high school diplomas. My MIL dropped out of college in the first week because her roommate was a lesbian. Her uncle paid for her and her cousin to travel to Europe after high school. 

They met in 1976 and married at 19 years old in 1977. They bought their first house in 1987 for 85K and at the time my FIL was earning 60K and my MIL 30K. They didn't pay for any of their family vacations as my MIL's parents would plan and pay. Including two family trips to Hawaii, and one to Europe. 

Both sets of grandparents were involved in my hubby's childhood. They babysat until they started school, and my MIL's parents would host my hubby and his brother for over the summer, and help shop for back to school clothes and school supplies. 

They bought their second house in 2002 for 165K. My hubby lived at home during college and paid for their cable and internet bill. They also claimed him as dependent. They offered no help towards college. Because their salary was too high, he couldn't receive financial aid, so both my hubby and his brother got into student loan debt because my in-laws insisted that they go to college. 

My MIL had a rich aunt, and they'd visit her every other month and get 10K for ""helping out"" during their visit. My MIL's uncle took pity on them and in 2015 paid off their remaining mortgage. They upgraded their cars and my MIL only working a few hours a week. 

When my MIL's parents passed away they got a lot of $$$ the amount we do not know. But they bought a 75K swim spa, a 10K sauna, and updated their kitchen counters and backslash. They are now 67 and  retired. 

The reason I share this is because they continually say ""we never got anything handed to us."" It's as if they're immune to understanding the amount of privilege and entitlement they've received. 

We have a 4yo and 2yo and they've only me our oldest and not our youngest. They are absent grandparents. They would rather go to concerts and have 70's swim spa parties. My MIL posts victim posts on Facebook, but then doesn't ever come when invited. There's always an excuse and victim response and all her friends fall for it. 

My hubby and I are successful and haven't had the extended family experience we received as children with our childrens' grandparents. We are the ones putting in all the work to visit them and pay for them to come on vacation with us. They couldn't even pay for a cup of coffee without a guilt trip about how our generation is entitled. Projection, considering we have picked up where my in-laws parents dropped off at assuming financial responsibility for them, and for what?

A lot of our friends also talk about having absent grandparents and how much more involved our grandparents were, simply because they were family and wanted to love and be apart of our lives - not for what they could financially get out of it. Is anyone else experiencing this, too? Why is this generation of grandparents like this? ",13,1742829144.0,absentgrandparents,2,0.93,False

He quit his job out of the blue, and at first, I supported his decision because I knew the had been struggling. I’ve had mu share of bad workplace experience too, but I stuck it out until I gained enough experience and skills to transition to a better company.

At first, I thought he just needed time to regroup, but as the months passed, I started noticing pattern. Every job interview he attended has *something* wrong with it - either company wasn’t good enough, the position wasn’t what he expected, or he just got a ‘bad vibe’. I understand being cautious after one bad experience, but rejecting every opportunity based on a single interview?

**The final straw came yesterday.**

We had a long discussion -one of those never-ending exhausting conversations-how hard it is for him to find a job, how the job market is terrible, cue the victim mentality, and how *I* just got *LUCKY* with my career and life. ***LUCKY!?*** I grew up with nothing. I studied day and night to earn my Master’s degree. I worked relentlessly to learn English so I could advance in my field. (We live in Europe, and English is not our native language). I never had back up plan, no inheritance to fall back on-just sheer determination to build a future for myself.

I tried, once again, to encourage him, I suggested he use this time to take an online course in his area of expertise-something to improve his skills and make himself more employable. His excuse? *Courses cost money, and he doesn’t have any.* But, guess what? He somehow always has money for cigarettes and beer with friends.

**A side note for context:** We both still live with our parents, but I’ve already put a down payment on an apartment and will be moving next week. I’m also planning to buy a car in the next few months (I didn’t need one before because my previous job provided a company car for private purpose as well). Meanwhile, he has no savings, no car, and still lives with his parents. Instead of making concrete plans for his future, he romanticises the idea of ‘starting from nothing’ and building a life together from scratch.

**Second side note for context:** We met randomly at a coffee shop one night, and at first, I genuinely enjoyed our time together. But as time passes, I keep asking myself: *What kind of live could I possibly build with this man? How long will it take for him to stand on his own two feet?*

Is it wrong to say that he adds no value to my life? That I can’t picture a future with him filled with success, growth, and adventures?",26,1742829115.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,31,1.0,False

I'm burnt out . I truly believe 2 is the sweet spot for optimal quality of life 

So which should I quit 

J1 $96k full time permanent been there 2 years before i found out about OE- requires some in office days but my boss is cool as hell and lives in another state and doesn't care so I usually coffee badge it one day and leave . This company also did horrible in 2024 - had massive layoffs (not me ) and stocks plummeted  ... the only thing is my health insurance is here (also I have health insurance at j2 ) and my boss is soooooooooooooo nice - i can bet money he also is OE. I cover for him he covers for me - we have an unspoken understanding - I be lying like hell for him lolol - I don't wanna leave him lol 


J2: $99k huge growing business - they are doing well - bonuses are 15% - such a great place to work but because they are a sort of new company they ask me to do wayyyyyyyyyyyyy to much however the entire team is cool and they don't micromanage at all - I block my calendars and everything is fine 


J3 - $96k a contract was supposed to end December 2024 - they have extended it 4 times now - they are in a different time zone so that helps I'm bored here ugh and one of the people I work with just told my contracting agency that she doesn't know what I'm doing most days (I don't report to her so I told the contracting agent to tell her to kiss my ass basically ) I'm trying to wait until this one naturally falls off. But they keep extending it - when it ends the recruiter will place me at another place so I don't want to burn the bridge by quitting early 


J4: full time $130k so cool my boss his hella laid back - it's a brand new company so I'm doing pretty much everything but no micro management at all - I block and reschedule time as needed - it's basically a huge finance company (although I'm not in finance ) my recruiter sent me here - it was supposed to be a contract but I interviewed soooo well they begged to hire me full time 🙄 so I said yes

Natry ko yung season single origin nila, the beans were from Kenya and OMFG. It's like nagkaroon ng fireworks ang utak ko nung triny ko siya. This was back in like May or June of last year. Went back to Cebu last week and I tried three different beans naman. Ethiopia Hamasho washed and Natural aaaand one more pero nakalimutan ko na yung name. And same experience.. Sumabog yung utak ko. Cause like who knew that coffee could taste like this? I gotta share this experience with other people.

Best I could figure out with their equipment is they use a Fellow coffee server and a Kalita Wave Tsubame 185. Sobrang nasayangan lang ako kasi I wasn't able to talk to the brewer. How he pours his coffee, and all that jazz.

Because of that, I decided to get my own equipment. I bought a Hario V60 (Kalita is too damn expensive), Timemore Black Mirror scale, Kingrinder P2, and a cheap kettle.

Triny ko naman din kumausap sa ibang brewers from different cafes pero tinatamaan ako ng social anxiety kasi baka majudge ako and baka snob-in lang din ako or hindi pansinin masyado. (Although, I've spoken with a few na sobrang bait)

I am now very overwhelmed with the amount of information. The amount of clicks sa grinder to get the best grind size. The temperature of water for different type of roasts. Different coffee recipes for pour overs. And the worst one in my opinion is water.

  
WATER... I've probably spent almost 10k to get all of the stuff that I need to make coffee and now I gotta think about water?

To satisfy it, I of course did some research. Making DIY coffee water, combinations of bottled water, mineral sachets, filter systems, etc. I also checked out an old thread in this subreddit who asked what's the best thing to do with water. Alon ng Kape seems to always pop up. Same thing was mentioned with the other dude who asked about it in the other coffee subreddit.

  
Okay sige game, Alon Water, add to cart. Then I thought, hold on... I gotta buy absolute distilled water cause eto daw best to mix with Alon Water. Okay medyo eeeeeh cause plastic but for the sake of science, sure. Tapos naisip ko, if I wanna bring my setup sa office para I can brew there, edi kailangan ko bumili ng lalagyanan. HAHAHA parang nanganganak nalang ng gastos. All of that, just for the love of coffee.

Forget about grinding beans, tamping, and⁤ mastering the art of frothing milk – the Inissia simplified the entire process.Additionally, its *relatively affordable price point* made it accessible to a wider range of ⁣consumers. Unlike high-end espresso machines that can cost hundreds ‌or ‍even ‍thousands of dollars, the ‍Nespresso Inissia offered a taste of the premium coffee experience without breaking the bank, making it​ a great cheap nespresso inissia ‍option. the Nespresso brand itself carried significant weight.

## Nespresso ‌Inissia: A‍ Feature-by-Feature Examination

To understand whether the Nespresso Inissia remains a relevant choice in 2025,it’s essential to⁤ delve into its core features:

*  ⁢ **Compact Design:**⁣ The‍ Inissia's ​small footprint ⁤remains one of its biggest advantages. Its dimensions are truly space-saving, making ‍it a perfect fit ​for even ⁤the most ⁢cramped kitchens.

You can find the exact nespresso inissia dimensions and nespresso inissia weight online to ensure it fits your space.

*   **Simple ⁣Operation:** Operating the Inissia is incredibly easy. The ⁣machine ‌features ‌just two buttons – one⁤ for espresso ‌(40ml)​ and one for lungo (110ml).Simply‌ insert a capsule, close the lever, and press the‌ desired button. The machine heats up quickly ​and brews the coffee⁤ in a matter of seconds.*   **19 Bar Pressure:** Nespresso machines, including ‌the Inissia, utilize a 19-bar pressure system.⁤ This high pressure helps⁤ extract ⁢the full flavor and⁤ aroma from‍ the coffee capsules, resulting in a rich and⁢ crema-topped ⁢espresso.

*   **Water‍ Tank Capacity:** The Inissia's water tank typically holds around 24 ounces⁢ (0.7 liters). This capacity is suitable⁢ for individual use or for ⁤brewing ‌a ‌few cups for ​guests.

*  ⁢ **Automatic Shut-off:** To conserve energy, the Inissia⁤ automatically shuts ‌off after nine minutes of inactivity.This feature is not only environmentally friendly but also⁣ provides peace of mind.

## The Target Audience: Who is the Nespresso Inissia For?

Understanding the target audience is crucial for⁢ evaluating the Inissia's continued relevance. The Inissia primarily caters to‌ two main demographic⁣ groups:

*   **Young professionals and Urban Dwellers (22-35):** this group values ​convenience, affordability, and style. They often‌ have ‌limited kitchen space and seek a quick and easy coffee solution ⁤that⁤ fits their ⁤budget.They might potentially be students or just starting their careers, and ⁤so⁣ price is a ⁣significant‌ factor. They are likely to be digitally savvy and search for deals and discounts online such as the nespresso inissia sale. Therefore, someone who is in the age bracket of 25-55 is also likely to buy the machine if their values align (convenience, quality, efficiency).

*   **busy Professionals and Homeowners‍ (25-55):** This group seeks convenience and quality coffee without the hassle of⁣ traditional espresso ⁣machines. They appreciate efficiency and value for money. While they may have a ⁢slightly larger budget, they still want a reliable and easy-to-use coffee machine that delivers a consistent ⁢cup of ​coffee. They ⁣also⁢ are ⁣in the​ middle to⁢ upper-middle class and occupy urban and suburban areas.

Both groups share similar pain points: lack of time for elaborate coffee preparation,the desire⁣ for barista-quality coffee at home without the high cost and the need for reliable and easy-to-use coffee experience.

Hey Chicago! My wife and I (both in our mid-50s) are looking to expand our social circle and meet some like-minded friends for casual hangouts, coffee, dinner parties, and maybe even some late-night techno adventures—though let’s be real, most events start way too late for us these days.

A little about us:

Music: We love underground techno but don’t make it out as much as we used to. Would be great to find people who still appreciate the music, whether it’s at a show, a chill vinyl session, or just geeking out over tracks.
Fitness & Health: My wife is into Pilates, and I focus on boxing & resistance training. We both enjoy staying active and cooking healthy meals (always happy to swap recipes or host a dinner night!).
420-Friendly & Drinks: We’re totally cool with chill sessions, but I have CHS and can’t partake myself. We’re also social drinkers—always down for a good cocktail.
Hobbies: My wife is a big reader and into art. I’m into music production & DJing. We also love hiking, movie nights, and some good trash TV.
Vibes: We click best with laid-back, chill people but also appreciate high-energy friends who bring good energy to the mix.
Not looking to swing, lol —just good times with good people! If any of this sounds like your vibe, hit us up! Would love to start a little community of like-minded folks who enjoy good music, good food, and good times—without necessarily staying out until sunrise.

1jisuev,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jisuev/strategies_on_working_out_needed/,Strategies on working out needed,"Is working out really that hard for us?

I have been struggling with this a lot lately. I have never been able to consistently do any type of exercise for prolonged periods of time, and this has impacted me tremendously given that I am a 25 yo woman who has always had low self-esteem due to body image. Being able to workout and tone my body would have made my life so much easier... I know, of course, that we should accept ourselves and yadda yadda, but even though I have been in therapy for years, there are some things about my body that I simply cannot accept because I know I'm like this because I'm sedentary and I don't like being unhealthy. 

My main problem is, I take Vyvanse (50mg) and by the time I get home from work (around 9:30pm), I am dead tired and the meds effect is pretty much over, I'm starving and I just want to eat dinner and go to bed. Early in the morning, when I wake up, I have NO energy to exercise, and I can't workout before work (after taking Vyvanse) because that's when the meds are peaking and most of us know that usually means a high heartbeat and all that, and although my heart is healthy (last checkup was last year), I think working out on meds might be a little to much for me (my family has a history of heart disease, so I don't wanna push it). 

If you guys manage to do it before meds, how do you do it? Do you think getting up and putting on workout clothes first thing in the morning would help? I have organized my room already, I bought 2kg bars and 4 x 1kg weights that I can add to the bars, and I have a workout plan that I tried doing before I started working and I really liked it.

I need to do it after waking up, but I don't want to drink coffee to have the energy to do it, so I would have to take my meds and workout in the 1 hour I have until the meds start taking effect. I know motivation is something we don't always have, but what I really need is energy. I am trying my best to sleep as much as possible and I've been improving, but I still haven't managed to get up and workout instead of getting up and eating breakfast.

I am someone who likes to do things right, so if I have to workout, I need to warm up first.. I'm afraid I might be making things too complicated and procrastinating because it's too much of a hassle. 

Does anyone have a strategy? Any advice on how I can convince my brain to do it? 

People say that if we want things, we get up and do it, but this is something I want and I just can't seem to follow through. I'm not giving up, so that's why I'm writing here. I've failed this a thousand times but I will keep trying no matter what, I just feel a little lost and maybe someone has advice I haven't heard already that will help me do it at least once (which would already be a win! If I exercise at least one time in the morning, to me that would mean I could do it every other morning).

TL;DR I need advice on working out without the influence of meds, first thing in the morning. I want to be done with it early because around nighttime I will have all the excuses not to do it, but I have no energy no matter how much I sleep. Personal accounts of consistently working out despite having ADHD could also help!

1jisspo,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodtrucks/comments/1jisspo/scaling_lemonade/,Scaling Lemonade,"I started selling at markets about 5 years ago. Initially it was just black coffee and coffee beans. Eventually adding iced coffee and after seeing how many children were walking away without drinks I added lemonade. It quickly became my highest seller and highest margin product.

I don't do fresh squeezed as I believe it's mostly a novelty with lower quality than using lemon juice. Lemon quality always varies a lot. 

I make a lemonade syrup a head of time (about 3L jugs) and then make down with 2 gal of water as needed. 

This year we are going all in on Lemonade and putting together a Fancy Lemonade Stand for festivals and night markets. Where I am concerned is scaling it.

1jisroy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HimsWeightloss/comments/1jisroy/hims_kit_6/,HIMS KIT 6,"Beginning of the year (2025) I decided I was tired of being crazy fat and challenged myself to lose 100 pounds. After Christmas of 2024 I weighed myself at 400.1 pounds, I decided enough was enough. I did a lot of research as far as weight loss supplements, my mother uses Ozyempic(sp?) and has lost about 130 pounds on it over the last year and a half. I can't bring myself to take a shot every day, I have an immense fear of needles. So I found Hims offers pills you can take. The pills do seem to have some side effects, I am mostly worried about the nausea, throwing up, and brain fog. 

I cut out all fast food (I've had Taco Bell **ONCE** due to being stuck at a conference) and all caffeine. I gave up soda about a year ago, I was a heavy Mountain Dew drinker, sometimes up to 4 liters a day. I was also an avid coffee drinker, never black, always full of sugar. I would go through coffee shops often, always ordering something with a LOT of sugar. I was intaking about 1600-2400MG of caffeine a day and found it almost impossible to sleep at night or to get *good* sleep.

For some background info, I am 32 years old, single, and live in Indianapolis, Indiana. From January 1 - March 23 I challenged myself to just simply lose some weight. I do not enjoy cooking, so I looked at some meal prep options and ended up going with Herculean Meal Prep. They are based out of Indianapolis, the meals are frozen but they have fantastic nutritional value and use really great ingredients. Every meal I have had, and I've tried every single one (their menu changes seasonally), has been at least an 8/10 for flavor. They also fill me up, I have one for breakfast and usually two for dinner. It never exceeds 2,100 calories that way. 

  
I have tried dieting before but never stuck with it, normally I just apply a ton of pressure to myself until I cave and take out the entire candy aisle of a grocery store. This time I made a deal with myself, I would be good on the days I work and get one 'bad' meal on my off days. I am off Thursday & Sunday so usually Wednesday night and Saturday night I will pick something up on my way home or go out to eat with friends. This way I still feel like I am in control but also enjoy some of the foods that aren't super great for me. It's also easier to curb my habits of eating out since I always have the Herculean meals at home. 

  
I have always had an unhealthy relationship with food, I grew up eating a lot of take out and brought that into my adult life when I moved out at eighteen. Big fan of pizza, pasta, and anything sweet. I can't keep candy in my house or I will devour it all in one sitting. Fortunately I still have good teeth with only one cavity, that's another journey I've embarked on but that's not what this post is for.  

  
Today is March 24, 2025. I just took my first dose of the **Hims Kit 6** about three hours ago**.** I did not sleep well last night, I was fully overcome with anxiety and actually woke up in a sweat. I very rarely ever take pills, even when I'm sick it takes a lot for me to use Nyquil/Dayquil. I prayed while taking a shower this morning. I was so nervous about side effects. I took the pills with breakfast, currently I feel fine. I plan to keep updating this at least monthly. 

  
So here it is, I weighed in at 400.1 pounds on January 1st, 2025. I weigh myself every Friday morning, all of the current weights listed below are done *before* the Hims Kit 6. I will update with weights from Friday's moving forward after starting the kit. I hope this helps anyone interested in signing up. 

  
Weights PRE-Kit:

  
1/1/25: 400.1

1/3/25: 398.4

1/10/25: 397.2

1/17/25: 395.8

1/25/25: 392.1

1/31/25: 388.3

2/7/25: 385.4

2/21/25: 382.9

3/7/25: 369.5 (Sick with bronchitis & sinus infection)

3/14/25: 375.7

3/21/25: 377.2

Down 22.9 pounds by myself. Honestly pretty proud of that. I am hoping the kit bumps the speed up a bit.

So I am not sure what is suspicious and what is not. 

I have been seeking a SB in forums relevant to my locality and have had a few online interactions, but no in-person meetings so far. Recently, one of the women said she is ready to meet me. I suggested meeting in a coffee place (I thought this was the norm based on what I read in the wiki and posts here and elsewhere). But she refused and said that the first few meetings should be private and that we should check if we have sexual chemistry. She went on to tell me about her boundaries and the compensation she expects in return for these meetings. She then said that if this part works out, we can arrange for public meetings and dates with a regular allowance. 

I am posting here because I am not sure if this is a red flag or just  uncommon. I am worried that I am being lured into some kind of scam. 

I first assumed that I am talking to an escort trying to present herself as a SB? So I searched for her on the local escort sites but didnt find any  profile that matches. Perhaps she isn't an escort but suddenly needs money?

I started my Invisalign mid-October with tray changes every 7 days so I’m on my 23rd tray now and have a full treatment for 2 years. Also, I’m in uni so I also get the stress that comes with have trays in while doing all this too. 

None of this is medical advice, I am not a doctor/dentist/orthodontist & all of it is personal and true to me but might not be for another

***How to get used to them:***

My first week with them was hellish, I won’t lie. but **it gets better** I promise. I was definitely stressed that I wouldn't get used to the tight feeling, my jaw was hurting from chewing on them, and I had headaches too. All of these things went away! It sucks but after a couple weeks/ tray changes I got more used to the feeling and had no more pain (other than some on the first 2 days of a tray change)

***Hygiene:***

It’s totally an investment but an ultrasonic cleaner changed my life. My hand was straight up cramping from brushing my Invisalign every night. I bought [this $40 ultrasonic](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CGR85JX9?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) & use [these cleaning tablets](https://a.co/d/hAGwmmu). My Invisalign stain less and have always come out clean. 

Also, my oral hygiene is the best I’ve ever had. Now that I’m forced to brush my teeth every morning and night and floss so that stuff isn’t stuck under the aligner, my dentist is a lot happier lol. 

***Drinking/eating with them:***

I’ve seen people on here say that are allowed to eat with these but I don’t. Other than the occasional mint, I don’t risk eating meals since I now wouldn’t be obligated to clean my teeth & gums after a meal. 

I will say, with the disclaimer that drinking with these on can both cause staining and also increase your risk of cavities/ sugar staying on your teeth first long periods (I’m not a dentist tho). BUT I drink everything under the sun with these except red wine. One thing that will stain you like no tomorrow is turmeric so beware because I had a soup that did me dirty. I have coffee daily and don’t want to sacrifice wear time BUT I’m not cavity prone so this is a personal choice. Also I’ve only seen minimal staining by the 7th day with daily coffees.

***Travelling with them:***

PLS bring your last tray and the correct amount of tray changes required. Also, I bring my ultrasonic with me places because it’s just that useful. and your Invisalign case is a must! Put a back up plastic bag in your backpack/purse too so that you’re not the “I just threw out the napkin with my tray in it” person. 

Also put a to-go toothbrush and floss in your backpack and refill a travel bottle with mouthwash (if you already have some) in your bag too. Super useful.

A couple hours later she wanted to run errands and I told her I’d go with her but I’d need to stay in the car. Her errands were short so I asked if we could go sit on a bench over looking some flower fields. Not only did I sit on the bench for 40 mins in the sun but I also walked 1/4 mile. The sun felt so nice. 

When we got home I was feeling really good and offered to go to the grocery store to pick up ingredients for dinner. I did but then had to sit in my cat for half an hour before I could drive back and then sit for another 20 mins once I got to my mom’s house. 

She wants to grill and asked me if I had the energy to do so and I did which was about 20 ish minutes standing. 

I ate dinner and stayed for another hour at her house!!!

Usually I can only go over to her house for 2-3 hours if we do nothing but sit on the couch. This was such a huge win for me and best part. I didn’t crash. Yes, I was fatigued yesterday but didn’t feel like I had PEM.

TL;DR: I had a great day Saturday and felt like myself again without a significant crash. ",15,1742828117.0,cfs,3,1.0,False

1jisjf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1jisjf2/the_woman_at_the_ren_faire/,The Woman at the Ren Faire,"When my girlfriend, Ella, recommended we go to the local renaissance faire I absolutely jumped on the idea. I hadn’t been since I was a kid, but I always remembered loving it. The cool venders, the food, the awesome jousting matches. It was everything a kid could love. My recent hyperfixation on medieval times and fantasy also definitely helped to drive my excitement for the event. I also had been needing a good excuse to get out and be social again. I had found myself too busy with school and work to get out and actually live.

Both of us called up a bunch of our friends and worked out a time for us to meet up there and enjoy the festivities. We even both ordered and threw together simple medieval costumes to wear to the event. I was so excited for the day that would lead to such torment.

The day itself was very eventful, enjoyable even. The ren faire was everything I hoped it would be and more. Everyone had a great time watching the shows, shopping, eating overpriced food, and playing games. I remember loving getting to have Ella holding my arm by my side the whole time. We had been together for some time now. She had become such a fixture in my life that I couldn’t imagine a world without her. While my time at the faire was spectacular, I had this weird feeling from the moment I walked through the gate that I was being watched.

After the first few minutes, I blew off the feeling, thinking it was ridiculous. I assumed I hadn’t been getting out enough. I had been too focused on my courses’ assignments and work and have pushed off being social. I figured the feeling was just a bit of social anxiety after being cooped up too long. I chose to ignore it and after a while, the feeling waned to near nothingness.

After the sun went down and the group was getting ready to leave, that was when I first saw her. A woman, probably in her mid-30s. I couldn’t explain why my eyes were drawn to her, she wasn’t dressed up or anything, she was in normal everyday street clothes. She was scanning the crowd intensely. Her expression was fixed with intensity. She looked over the crowd how I would expect a mother to look over a crowd after realizing she lost her child.

Her eyes met mine as she combed over the crowd and immediately the uneasy feeling at the start of the day came back worse than before. This time though, there was something more. A mix of dread and sadness crept into my mind as our eyes locked. The woman’s eyes widened with a more desperate look than before. I can’t explain it, but I felt hypnotized by the look she gave me until one of my friends spoke up,

 “So, are we getting out of here or what?”

 I looked away from the woman to my friend, who must have seen the uncomfortable look on my face.

“Woah. Mason, you alright?” he asked.

I looked back to the crowd, but the woman was gone and with her disappearance the uneasy feeling faded as well.

“Yeah. Sorry. Some lady was just staring at me really weird.” I said with a chuckle that tried masking discomfort. “Yeah, let’s get out of here.”

We all said our goodbyes in the parking area and went our separate ways. As Ella and I were making our way back to our truck, I heard a woman’s voice approaching from behind us.

“Excuse me? Sir? Sir!”

I turned around in time to see the woman from before approaching. It was darker in the parking area, but she was close enough that I could see what looked to be black beads in her hands.

“Yeah? How can I help you?” I asked.

 “For you.”

 She smiled, but her voice was monotone. The woman held out the black beads that I could now see made a necklace and was covered in what appeared to be white runes.

 I took Ella’s hand and continued walking to my truck while responding,

 “No thank you. I already spent enough money inside. I don’t need to spend anything else.”

She continued behind us, insisting.

“Please. Just try it on, sir.” She sounded more desperate now. “I think it will be good for you.”

I got Ella inside my truck and began walking to the driver’s side, trying to avoid eye contact with the strange woman and reaffirming that I wasn’t interested. I couldn’t explain it, but the woman being so close to me now was driving me insane. It was like my emotions were being gutted. The closer she got, the worse I felt. I wanted nothing more than to get away from her.

As I reached for the handle of my door, I saw the woman’s hand reach out and grab my arm before hearing her pleading,

“Please, sir, I know you don’t understand, but I need you to take this and wear it. There is-”

I pulled back my hand roughly and snapped, “Don’t you dare grab me like that you weirdo! I have no clue who the hell you are or why you want me to have your stupid Etsy project, but it’s not happening. Go find some other loser to sell your cheap junk to!”

It was as though her touch flipped a switch in me. The sadness, the gutted feeling, was replaced with anger that exploded out of me. I climbed into my truck and slammed the door. Immediately, I felt off about what I had said. Even in incredibly uncomfortable and less than favorable situations, I am always very calm and never aggressive or insulting to people. Ella, seeing how odd I acted and how upset I was, placed her hand on my arm,

“Let’s get home, ok?”

I nodded and began backing out of the parking space.

After backing out, I put my truck into drive and looked forward to now see the woman standing in the parking space we just pulled out of. In my headlights, I could see her clearly, clutching the black beads to her chest, with a face that looked like she hadn’t slept in days. As the light shined on her, I noticed something else that I hadn’t before: her eyes were filled with tears. As I looked into her sorrow-filled eyes, for a moment, I considered going and taking the necklace from her. However, this feeling was quickly replaced by the same abnormal anger I felt before.

“Crazy bitch.” I hissed under my breath before speeding off.

That night was the first night the dream came to me. The memory of it fragmented, nothing more than fading flashes. An empty void, a dark forest, a twig breaking behind me, turning to see what it was, and then waking up. Dreams are a strange thing, the memory of the dream was as though I had no feeling of fear, but upon waking from it, I was left in a cold sweat, breathing as though I had a near-death experience. I grabbed my phone and checked the time, 12 a.m. exactly.

Things started getting strange over the next few weeks. To say my luck was bad would be an understatement. It started off small, my phone would go missing only to find it a few hours later in a place I had already looked, glasses being too close to the edge of the counter and falling off, those sorts of things.

As time went on though, the misfortune became more serious. I’d get ready for work only to spend 30 minutes looking for my keys only to realize my wallet is now missing right after I found the keys, making me late and putting me in bad standings with my boss. I would go to submit an assignment for one of my college classes just to find the files I was using somehow got corrupted and I would have to start all over. I even had weird stuff like multiple birds flying into my windows and breaking their necks, something that always upset me as a big animal lover. These things happened sparsely in the first few weeks, but after the first month they became more frequent.

Every time these misfortunes would happen, I would feel anger and sadness welling up more and more. All of this was further fed by tiredness that came from being woken up every few days at exactly the same time by a dream that made no sense. Once those emotions subsided, I would be left with a growing emptiness in me. I’m ashamed to say it, but the stress and anger lead me to push everyone away. I suddenly had no time for friends and little time for Ella. When I was around the people I cared for I was left with this deflated feeling that made me a husk of the happy person I once was. After 2 months, I felt like I had become a completely different person.

I have never believed in the paranormal. I loved the idea of ghosts and spirits, but I never believed those things could actually exist. I chalked up what was happening to me as a string of bad luck mixed with mood swings from stress and lack of sleep. Ella was the first one to suggest something paranormal might be happening. Unlike me, Ella was actually open-minded to the idea of paranormal stuff and even believed in it to at least some extent. With my terrible luck and even worse mood, she wondered if I somehow got into something bad. I don’t know if she fully believed it herself or if she was grasping at anything to get her boyfriend back.

“There are a lot of things in this world that we can’t explain, and tons of people have encounters with things that they swear are otherworldly. What if something is messing with you?” Ella said, showing me an article on curses and hauntings.

I’m ashamed to say, but I laughed at her when she suggested it. I don’t know why I did it. I always try to hear her out on everything with an open mind, but hearing the paranormal suggested made something inside me stir. It was so out of character and mean-spirited of me, but I laughed at her

“Are you serious?” I asked sarcastically.

“Yes.”

“Ok, cool, what is it then? Was it Casper or the gnomes that kept hiding my keys?”

“I’m being serious.”

“No, you’re not.” my voice raised, “You are sitting here bringing up fairy tales and magic to explain to me why *everything* in my life sucks right now! All I want is to be left alone so I don’t have to listen to people make excuses for something that is just bad luck!”

It was a lie. I didn’t want her to go. “Why am I being such a jerk?” I thought.

“I’m just throwing out ideas. I’m trying to help you.” She said quietly.

“Well, at least I’m not the only one losing my mind.”

Immediately, I came to my senses about how awful I was being. I tried to apologize, but the damage was already done.

“If you want to be miserable, you can be,” Ella said, “but you don’t have to make everyone miserable with you.”

She stormed out while I tried backpedaling what I said, digging a hole deeper for myself.

When Ella slammed the door behind her, and I was alone in my house again, the sinking feeling of guilt was almost unbearable. I stood there for a few minutes, pacing around the kitchen, looking at my phone, debating if I should call her and try to make things right. Ella was the only person who was trying to help me, the only person who knew everything going on in my life, and I pushed her away for trying to be there for me.

“Why did you push her away?” I thought.

“You’re so pathetic. You let a little bad luck drive everyone you care about away. You’re worthless. Less than worthless. You would have more use in the ground than going on with this miserable excuse for a life.”

I had never been suicidal in my whole life. These thoughts… they were alien to me. Yet for a moment, they made sense. My head was flooded with images, all the ways I could do it. Feeling that way, hearing the voice in my head say these things, it was terrifying.

The depression and guilt I felt in that moment was almost unbearable. I put my phone back in my pocket and I fell on my hands and knees and sobbed. And there, in my sorrow, grief, and self-pity, I noticed something. The room… seemed darker.

No… not the whole room. Just a small area shadowed around me.

“What?” I gasped, looking at the strange shadow around me. It didn’t make any sense; I was lying right under the kitchen light. The only way there could be a shadow around me was if… someone was behind me blocking the light. Immediately, a feeling came to the forefront of my mind. One that I had been experiencing for weeks but was so faint, I didn’t even notice until now, I was being watched, and whoever it was is right behind me.

I spun around with my hands in front of me. I expected to see some person dressed in all black with a knife or gun, but instead, I was faced with nothing but the glaring light bulb of the kitchen light fixture. The shadow was gone, but the feeling of not being alone was stronger than ever. I shot to my feet, my still-wet eyes jittering around the room, looking for a sign of anyone.

“Who’s there!?” I shouted, trying to sound threatening even though whoever would have been there was just listening to me cry like a toddler.

“I’m not messing around! I know someone is here! Come out and face me!” I demand.

I really, *really* wish I hadn’t.

After I finished speaking, I heard something in my kitchen cabinet, the sound of glass breaking. At first, it was a small *crack. crack. crack*. Then I heard a glass shatter, then another. “What the hell,” I whispered in a shaking voice, frozen, unable to comprehend the impossibility of what was happening.

Suddenly, the cabinet flew open, and shreds of broken plates and glasses were thrown out towards me. I ducked when the cabinet door opened so most of the glass missed me, but a few shards managed to land on the top of me and left a few cuts on my scalp and arms. Immediately, I ran out of the kitchen and into my bedroom.

Even though I couldn’t see it, I could feel it, its presence, it was inches behind me as I ran. It was like I could feel heat radiating off of it as I ran through the entrance to my bedroom, slamming and locking the door. I moved inside the bathroom to find something to treat my cuts. I reached for my phone. I needed to call the police, to call Ella, to call anyone who could come and help me. My phone was gone. “What? No. No no…” I whimpered as I patted myself all over, looking for my phone. I had put it in my pocket; where the hell could it have gone?

As I looked over my bedroom for my phone, a loud thud came from my door, followed by another, and another. The thuds were getting louder, and I could see the door start to buckle and shake under weight of whatever was doing this. I knew whatever the thing was, it was going to get into the bedroom eventually. In my desperation, I locked myself in the bathroom with the lights turned off. I heard the bedroom door crack and then break open. The silence that followed the sound of the door breaking was maddening.

I couldn’t hear footsteps or breathing. I could see from under the door the light of the bedroom flicker before hearing the bulb shatter as I was drowned in complete darkness. The immersing silence was broken by the sound of the doorknob to the bathroom being tested gently, followed by three quiet taps.

“Please. I don’t know what you want. I don’t know what I did wrong. I’m sorry.” I cried softly, “Please. Just leave me alone. I just want you to leave me alone.” 

My pleads were met with the sound of something hitting the door hard before falling to the ground. At first, I wondered what it could have thrown at the door, but my question was answered a few minutes later as a familiar ringtone filled the quiet room. It was my phone. What’s more, the ringtone was a special ringtone I set up for when Ella calls me. The help I needed was calling me. All I had to do was open the door and answer. Maybe it was waiting right outside the door or maybe it had already left the room. There was no way for me to know. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t open that door. My help would have to wait. I bandaged myself up the best I could before I laid on the cold floor and cried until all the energy left my body and I somehow fell asleep. There, I dreamed.

I was falling, falling through a black void. I could see my body, but everything around me was as black as an empty night sky. I’ve never had a fear of heights, but I’ve never been the most comfortable around them either. Fear of the eventual sudden stop grew and grew as I plummeted. I screamed as I fell. I pictured my friends, my family, I pictured Ella. I didn’t want to die.

Suddenly, the rushing wind on my back and feeling of falling stopped. Replaced with the crunchy cushion of dead leaves and the chirping of crickets while I looked up at a forest canopy covering a bright night sky. It was as if I was never falling to begin with. I stood to my feet, the fear of the falling and the memory of the presence in my home still weighing on me. However, in the calm of the forest I remembered that I had been here before, almost every night. The falling, the forest, it has plagued my mind every day for weeks. Only this time, it was clearer, I had more understanding of where I was and that I was asleep on the bathroom floor.

*crunch*

I remembered this. A noise approaching from behind, one that if I turned to face, the dream would end, a mistake I didn’t want to make.

*crunch*

As the noise drew closer, my fear grew. However, the presence behind me had an air of calm, of peace, of comfort. It felt different from the thing I was running from moments ago.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked

*crunch*

“Please. Just let me go.” I cried, “I just want to be ok again.”

Behind me, I heard a voice, a voice from my memory that I had forgotten. A voice whose memory shot to the forefront of my mind.  The voice of the woman from the renaissance faire.

“Come find me.” She said sternly.

“How can I find you, Maria?”

 Maria? I knew her name. She never told it to me, but I knew it somehow.

“Come find me.” She said again.

I turned to face her only to wake up on the bathroom floor. I didn’t know how long I had been asleep for, but I needed to get out of the house. I needed to get to Ella. She could help me find Maria. I opened the bathroom door, picking up my phone and checking the time, 12:12 a.m. My room was a mess, my bedroom door was broken open, my pillows and bed were shredded. All the lamps and light bulbs in the room were broken, a pattern I assumed would spread throughout the house. As I moved out of the bedroom, I opened my phone to call Ella. She wouldn’t like being woken up, but she would understand. As I rounded the corner into my kitchen, I dropped my phone in the shock of what I saw. In my mind, I assumed this presence that was tormenting me was formless. Something that could physically affect things but not be seen. I don’t know why I thought this, but that assumption was dashed as I looked at the monster in front of me.

The thing stood between me and the door leading to the garage. It was tall enough to have to hunch over to stand in my kitchen, making it well over 8 feet tall. Despite its height, the being was unnaturally slender, having the same width dimensions of an average thin person. Its skin, if you can call it skin, was like ink. It looked wet and oily, a light from the street shimmered off of its black form. Its head was shaped similar to a bird's. It was round, with what looked like a hooked beak over what I can only assume is a wide gaping mouth with no teeth.

I turned to run, too afraid to even scream. Before I had even made three steps towards the back door, the creature had grabbed me. Its long, slender hands had wrapped around my head and pulled me back, forcing me onto my back. I could feel it now; its skin was slick and wet, like grabbing at latex covered in dish soap. It placed its hand in my mouth and forced it open. I could taste it, like the taste when you accidentally breathe in sunscreen mixed with cinnamon. Then I felt it, a pouring into my mouth. It was as though the thing was melting down my throat. I choked, I cried, but I couldn’t move. Even as the monster shrank and melted into me, I could still feel its strength holding me down. Eventually, the stress of the situation became too much, and I passed out.

When I woke up on the floor the next morning, I felt like I had the worst chest congestion possible. I jumped to my feet and coughed over the sink, coughing up a mixture of phlegm, blood, and a black oily substance. I called Ella and told her that I needed to see her in public right then. I told her that I was sorry for what I said and that she was right and that I needed her help more than ever. She could have said no, she could have called me crazy, but she didn’t. She just asked how she could help. I assumed the thing knew more people would get involved if it started throwing things around in public and since it waited until Ella left the other night before lashing out, I imagined it didn’t want more people involved. So, I figured being in public would be my best shot at keeping it restrained.

I met up with Ella at a coffee shop and explained everything to her: the cuts, the dream, what the thing did to me. I don’t think she fully believed me at first, but her mind changed when I coughed up the strange black liquid into a napkin.

“I think it’s trying to break me down,” I said.

“Why? What does it need you broken down for?”

“I have no clue, but it’s working. I’m not myself anymore, even you’ve noticed that.”

Ella sipped her coffee, “And how do you feel now?”

“Terrible.”

“How so?”

“It makes me want to die.”

“What?” Ella’s eyes widened, setting her coffee down.

“Yeah. Like when you left the other night. I think the thing was trying to convince me to…” I hung my head. Unable to finish the sentence.

“What about that woman?” Ella asked.

“Maria? I don’t know. She has been there since it started, though.” I answered.

“Do you think she could have started all this?”

“Maybe. Or maybe she wants to stop it. All I know is that she wants me to find her. So that is what we’re going to do.”

It took a while of scouring Facebook and Instagram before we found her, turns out there are a lot of Marias in my area. But eventually, there she was, Maria Windsor. Her page was filled with spiritualist crafts and inspirational messages. She looked happier in her pictures than how I remembered seeing her, but it was her. I sent her a friend request and within a few minutes she accepted and sent a message. It was an address with the words, “Get here quickly.”

When we arrived at the address, we saw it was just an ordinary house in a completely unassuming neighborhood. Despite its unassuming nature, the thing that had latched onto me did not like me being there. The coughing was getting worse and worse the closer I got to the house. Walking up to her front door was an ordeal in and of itself. Eventually, I stopped at the steps to the door. I couldn’t catch my breath; I couldn’t stop coughing and spitting up that vile black liquid. At a certain point, I questioned if this was how I would die, on the doorstep of a mystery I would never understand. As my vision started to go dark, I saw the door to the house open and the fuzzy image of a woman approaching me.

When I came to, I was lying on a couch with Ella staring at me from across the room with a worried expression. Sitting on the coffee table in front of me was Maria.

“It’s nice to see you again, Mason,” Maria said with a small smile.

“Maria..?” I groaned, still waking up.

“Here, drink this.” She said, handing me a glass of water.

I sat up and took the water from her. It was then that I noticed the necklace of black beads around my neck.

“You got here just in time. Any later and it would have started fully taking you.” Maria said, her voice very matter of fact and direct.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Some say evil spirit, some say demon. It’s something non-human, not from our plane. Something that hates us.”

“Us?” I asked.

“Humans.” She replied quickly. “It hates people.”

“Why?”

Maria shrugged, “Who knows. It could be a number of reasons, but *it* and things like it don’t usually speak to us candidly with people.”

“What does it want?” I asked quietly.

“Your death.” Her words cut me like a knife.

I looked around the rooms. It was filled with oddities like crystals, incense burners, sigils, herbs, and different colored strings. I could also see religious paraphernalia scattered throughout the room, things like crucifixes, rosary beads, and what I assume was holy water.

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Someone who wants to help you.”

“But why?”

“Because I know what it’s like to lose someone to this thing. And I don’t want to see anyone else suffer because of it.” Maria looked at Ella, who was clearly still shaken up from what had happened on the doorstep.

I reached up and touched the necklace. I could almost feel warmth radiating off of it.

“This wards it off,” I muttered. “That’s why you were trying to give it to me?”

Maria frowned, “It would have. But judging by the black shit you’re coughing up I’m going to go out on a limb and say the thing has already infested you. At this point, all it does is weaken it.”

“How did you reach me in my dream?” I asked.

“Astral projection.” She said. “I tried almost every night to reach you. The problem is the spirit is a strong one and it would block our link. Your girlfriend filled me in on the night I was able to reach you. My guess, the spirit used up too much energy torturing you and it wasn’t strong enough to block the link.”

“What can we do to fix this?” I asked.

“At this point,” Maria said, “The spirit is too close to taking you over. We’re going to have to get it out of you by force.”

I had seen and heard of exorcisms in all sorts of fictional media. I never believed it was a real thing, let alone that one day I would be the one strapped to a table shirtless with what I can only assume is a witch and my girlfriend standing around me. The room was decorated with more oddities than the living room was. The two doors in and out of the room had ornate crucifixes hanging over them and the whole room was lined with red string. The shelves in the room were covered in bottles filled with different herbs and spices, and the edges of the floor were covered in a pristine line of salt.

“This will be a very unpleasant experience for you,” Maria said somberly. “Your mind will be taken closer to the spirit’s world. You will see and feel things that are imperceivable to us. It will be a lot to take in. But that is why it is good that she’s here.” Maria said this while looking at Ella. “She’ll keep you grounded.”

Despite the gravity of the words Maria was speaking to me, her cadence and delivery were like that of a doctor describing an invasive surgery to a patient. She spoke like she had done this many times before.

I squeezed Ella’s hand. “I’m ready.”

Maria winced in a way that told me I wasn’t.

“Then let’s begin.” She said calmly.

Maria began to burn incense and chant quietly in a language that I couldn’t understand. I gave Ella a worried glance just before the smell of the incense accosted my nose. Neither Maria nor Ella reacted to the smell, but to me, it reeked of rot and spoiled milk. I could feel its smoke burning in my lungs. The smell was accompanied by an equally strange sight. The room suddenly looked as though everything was completely covered in shadow. It reminded me of when your phone is on, but you don’t touch it for a long time and the screen goes dim before turning off. The sight and smell were enough to freak me out. I was breathing heavily and squeezed Ella’s hand tighter as she looked down at me with a nervous stare.

After a few minutes of this, I began to feel a stirring in my chest. I needed to cough, but I couldn't sit up to cough the mess in my lungs out of me. Then I felt it, a pressing on my chest. When I looked down though, I realized it wasn’t something pressing on my chest, it was something inside of my chest pressing out. I could feel the subtle touch of fingertips rubbing against the inside of my ribcage. “What the hell is that!?” I whispered. Maria continued her chanting, and Ella just squeezed my hand, looking at the spot on my chest that I was looking.

I could now feel what felt like the palm of someone’s hand pushing up on my ribcage. The discomfort it caused was unnatural. I lurched on the table and let out a yell. Maria’s chants grew louder as Ella stumbled back, frightened by my screams. I looked down to now see several small pointy objects pushing out the skin between my ribs. I screamed out and looked away as black inky fingertips broke through the skin with a hideous pop, I could feel small streams of liquid streaming down my sides. The strangest thing was that, despite feeling the pressure, there was no pain coming from the wounds, only the mental anguish from watching my own body’s mutilation. I watched in horror as the fingers retreated back into my chest as I felt two palms now pressing up on the inside of my chest. After a few more moments of hearing nothing but my screaming and Maria’s chanting a new horrifying sound came to my ears, cracking.

I could hear my ribs breaking inside of me as the pushing continued. I couldn’t bear to look down as I heard the tearing of my skin, sounding like dull knives going through wet leather. I looked around the room in panicked agony to see Maria and Ella with sprays of my blood across them. However, Maria kept chanting and Ella stayed still. As I felt my chest open more, I could also now feel something much bigger than hands pushing through.

I looked down just in time to see the head and shoulders of the spirit push from my mangled torso with an awful screech, my crimson blood running off its shining black exterior. Its piercing cry made my ears ring out in pain, the first true pain I had felt since the exorcism began. The pain from the demon’s scream worked its way down my body. It was as though it woke up a part of me so I could now feel the pain radiating from the damage it had done to my chest. I closed my eyes and screamed out in pain, begging for the anguish to stop, wondering if there was any way out. When I opened my eyes, the being was bent down over me, half of its body still submerged in me. its abominable head just inches from mine. I could feel its offer running through my soul. It would take the pain away, it would end the suffering, all it wanted was for me to give it control.

For a moment, I wanted to say yes. I wanted to end this nightmare. To get away from everything. Death was preferable to me than this. I tensed my mouth, prepared to scream my answer, to let it know that it had won; to let it know it had broken me. Then, in all the pain and agony, I felt a familiar warm hand gently grab my arm. I looked to see Ella, with tears streaming down her face, knelt down beside me and speaking softly to me. “Keep going. Please.” She said through broken cries. “I need you to keep going for me. I love you, Mason.” As I looked into her eyes, for just a moment, I felt the pain leave and a calmness wash over me. In that brief moment, I mustered the strength to whisper four simple words, “I want to live.”  I screamed out a cry of pain as the demon trashed back and screeched at my answer, the rest of its torso and legs forming from the black sludge that filled my chest. I watched as the spirit rose up out of me and dissipated into black mist in the air. My vision grew dark, and I watched the world go black.

As I shot upright on the couch, my hands instinctively went to my chest. I could feel my heart beating quickly against my perfectly intact ribs, no dried blood or scars in sight. I looked up, confused, just in time to see a sobbing Ella jump on me and hugged me so tightly that I struggled to breathe.

“You did good,” Maria said, sipping what looked like tea from across the room.

I struggled to speak “I… I saw it… It ripped… How am I...”

“What you saw and felt was the purging of your spirit. Things that we couldn’t perceive. To us, you were just thrashing and screaming”

“So, it’s really gone?” Ella asked.

“For him it is,” Maria sighed. “Unfortunately, keeping something like that out of our plane permanently is much more difficult.”

“Thank you, Maria,” I muttered.

Maria nodded and went back into her kitchen.

For the most part, life went back to normal after that. I had to really patch things up with my boss and push myself like crazy to catch back up in school, but I managed, especially with Ella and my friends by my side. I could have given up. I could have let it win. But I didn’t. I pushed forward and found hope. Hope in the ones I love, and the ones that love me.

If somehow, somewhere, there is someone out there reading this who is fighting this evil spirit, *keep fighting*. And if you run into some lady who is offering you strange black beads, for the love of God, *take them*.",6,1742828017.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

Now they seem to be acceptable and normal, even sometimes encouraged by the types of people where consumerism is part of their identity. 

Whats f-ed up about it? Your favorite person who you feel you have a bond with is promoting something they feel would better your life, right? And why shouldn't you send them your money, they entertain you with their silly jokes and editing, and they are your friend. Uh, no.  They want your money.  

They don't care you had to sit through two ads before the video started, depending on how long the video is you'll surely be watching some ads during the video, and after the video.  That ad revenue isn't enough for them, they want more.  Any channel large enough to be getting sponsorships on every video is also monetized by youtube.  Most of youtube is completely sterile and mind numbing.  

And besides, what about the people who pay for YT Premium? They didn't have to watch ads, so we need to plug sponsors in the video for them so they don't feel left out. Who cares if they are paying for the privilege of not being force fed products they don't need? And who cares I already actually get a little cut of that money too.  We can squeeze another 1$ out of them, so lets put in an ad that premium can't skip.  Make sure to use my promo code so I get the commission too, because that up front payment of a few hundred-few thousand dollars to simply talk about a product for 45 seconds isn't enough, I need to squeeze another 50 cents our of every 1000 viewers..... Good consumer. Good..... 


Now, don't forget to like and SMASH subscribe.  You haven't watched the video yet?  Irrelevant.. I don't trust you to remember to subscribe on your own, so I'm telling you to do it before you even watch because I've read it increases my income.   Oh, let me also ask a question and encourage you to drop the answer in the comments below, I honestly could not care less about whatever some viewer thinks and I already damn well know the answer anyway, but I know it'll drive up that engagement and people are dumb and think I actually care so it helps encourage the delusion that we have some kind of bond.  

Oh yeah, and check out every single one of my 18 social media, links below.  And check out my discord where I have a dozen teenagers moderating for free.  That's where I'll post weekly opportunities to somehow get more money out of you.  But the people will post memes and stuff so that's fun, right? 

And this channel is only possible thanks to my patreons, even though youtube pays the astronomical fees for internet data traffic and the army of software engineers keeping the site running,  and the monthly ad revenue I get from them, as well as the sponsorship deals...  This channel still wouldn't be possible unless you sign up to give me money automatically every month.    I'll even say your patreon username at the end of a video if you pay enough, isn't that worth it?  A bunch of strangers watching my video will hear ""stargazer 700"" and you will get a dopamine hit for some reason.  Such an honor. So be sure to pick the super awesome friends tier for perks like seeing my video a day early or something, lol.  So electricity, water, gas, phone, insurance, and patreon for the youtube ppl.   


And please check out MY MERCH!!!  yes... Go and check out my t shirts, mugs, pencils, bumper stickers.... Anything.  We can put my stupid icons on any cheap foreign made trinket for you.   LIMITED TIME SALE, this channel is possible thanks to people who buy my stuff.  

And you can also donate one time too.. I've kindly included my PayPal, crypto  wallets, buy me a coffee link, etc, etc, etc in the description too... If you wanted actual information about the video, you'll have to scroll past the endless prompts for taking your money. 


Here's the problem, and it's one a lot of you won't like, most channels are not worth this.  They aren't worth your money.  They make plenty from ads.  Some smaller channels who have the balls to discuss controversial topics and risk demonitization or being banned, sure. But that's not what you'll see on the trending tab, is it?  
These people Wil squeeze you dry if they could.  You think they're good people, they're funny, they're relatable...   Because you know them right?  
No, you see what they want you to see.   They aren't showing you who they actually are. 

So many channels are just crap. They add nothing new or interesting to any topic.  My favorite is the endless army of teenage early 20 somethings who act as if they are historians and physicists when all they do is summarize a Wikipedia article or on a lot of cases just pay some poor schmuck from fiver to write a script for them - someone who actually spent their years in the field, pouring over data, testimony, reading archives, doing the dirty work not spending time wanting to put his face online.   

They do bare minimum work, and always have their hand out for money.  Why? 

And a lot of these bigger channels will literally make videos, edit them, etc, then wait to post it until they have a sponsorship.  It's not just as if they had an exciting new original take on a topic and wanted to share information about it with you,  and coincidentally this awesome company wanted to collab with the channel, no.  They work with companies who connect products with youtube channels like a factory,  it's an assembly line.  Put the worthless cheap plastic mass produced product in front of as many eyeballs as possible... Period.   


People... None of this is normal.   You wake up in the moneing and check the mail, bills and junk mail advertising shit you don't need.  You drive to work in the morning, the street flanked by giant billboards with advertisements for more shit you don't need.  You listen to the radio, a station which plays the same 25 songs - astro turfed to popularity by the record labels which control our culture, and I between them playing the same 20 songs over and over you're bombarded with more advertisements for shit YOU DON'T NEED.  
You stop by the grocery store to buy lunch, you're asked if you'd like to round up the change to help some charity that sounds real and legit and designed to invoke empathy from you,  but in actuality the charity only gets 15% of that donation and the corporate grocery chain keeps the bulk of it. And that charity?  Yeah they have a ceo making 120k per year.  
You get to work, open your paycheck.  17% taken for taxes.  Every time you spend it, you're taxed again.  Save it?  Taxed on any capital gains from your investment.   Buy a house? Property taxes every year... Your money is taken when you make it, spend it, save it, even when you die you're taxed again.  
Then every year you have fees, registering something or reinstating something, your cat gets sick and 800$ bill, you chip a tooth... And on. And on.   and by some miracle, you have some money left after the world has taken its cut.  Now all you want to do is escape for a bit, so you open youtube.  And these people who have taken the noble task upon themselves to entertain the broken hopeless people watching, that have been bombarded with taxes, fees, plundered by the corrupt institutions and politicians,  what do they give you?  
A 25 minute video that should have been 8 minutes long, but they need to milk you too because you have some pennies left... Be sure to super chat them away to the person you're watching.. Even tho they make exponentially more money than you. 


The greed is out of control.  and the quality of the content does not warrant the greed.   The problem is quality has been so low for so long, it's become the standard.  The bar is so low it's a tripping hazard.  And people are so primed for consumerism, any criticism of their favorite brand or internet personality will invoke a primitive defensive response as if they themselves have been personally attacked....  People... This is not okay.

1jisi0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1jisi0o/the_woman_at_the_ren_faire/,The Woman at the Ren Faire,"When my girlfriend, Ella, recommended we go to the local renaissance faire I absolutely jumped on the idea. I hadn’t been since I was a kid, but I always remembered loving it. The cool venders, the food, the awesome jousting matches. It was everything a kid could love. My recent hyperfixation on medieval times and fantasy also definitely helped to drive my excitement for the event. I also had been needing a good excuse to get out and be social again. I had found myself too busy with school and work to get out and actually live.

Both of us called up a bunch of our friends and worked out a time for us to meet up there and enjoy the festivities. We even both ordered and threw together simple medieval costumes to wear to the event. I was so excited for the day that would lead to such torment.

The day itself was very eventful, enjoyable even. The ren faire was everything I hoped it would be and more. Everyone had a great time watching the shows, shopping, eating overpriced food, and playing games. I remember loving getting to have Ella holding my arm by my side the whole time. We had been together for some time now. She had become such a fixture in my life that I couldn’t imagine a world without her. While my time at the faire was spectacular, I had this weird feeling from the moment I walked through the gate that I was being watched.

After the first few minutes, I blew off the feeling, thinking it was ridiculous. I assumed I hadn’t been getting out enough. I had been too focused on my courses’ assignments and work and have pushed off being social. I figured the feeling was just a bit of social anxiety after being cooped up too long. I chose to ignore it and after a while, the feeling waned to near nothingness.

After the sun went down and the group was getting ready to leave, that was when I first saw her. A woman, probably in her mid-30s. I couldn’t explain why my eyes were drawn to her, she wasn’t dressed up or anything, she was in normal everyday street clothes. She was scanning the crowd intensely. Her expression was fixed with intensity. She looked over the crowd how I would expect a mother to look over a crowd after realizing she lost her child.

Her eyes met mine as she combed over the crowd and immediately the uneasy feeling at the start of the day came back worse than before. This time though, there was something more. A mix of dread and sadness crept into my mind as our eyes locked. The woman’s eyes widened with a more desperate look than before. I can’t explain it, but I felt hypnotized by the look she gave me until one of my friends spoke up,

 “So, are we getting out of here or what?”

 I looked away from the woman to my friend, who must have seen the uncomfortable look on my face.

“Woah. Mason, you alright?” he asked.

I looked back to the crowd, but the woman was gone and with her disappearance the uneasy feeling faded as well.

“Yeah. Sorry. Some lady was just staring at me really weird.” I said with a chuckle that tried masking discomfort. “Yeah, let’s get out of here.”

We all said our goodbyes in the parking area and went our separate ways. As Ella and I were making our way back to our truck, I heard a woman’s voice approaching from behind us.

“Excuse me? Sir? Sir!”

I turned around in time to see the woman from before approaching. It was darker in the parking area, but she was close enough that I could see what looked to be black beads in her hands.

“Yeah? How can I help you?” I asked.

 “For you.”

 She smiled, but her voice was monotone. The woman held out the black beads that I could now see made a necklace and was covered in what appeared to be white runes.

 I took Ella’s hand and continued walking to my truck while responding,

 “No thank you. I already spent enough money inside. I don’t need to spend anything else.”

She continued behind us, insisting.

“Please. Just try it on, sir.” She sounded more desperate now. “I think it will be good for you.”

I got Ella inside my truck and began walking to the driver’s side, trying to avoid eye contact with the strange woman and reaffirming that I wasn’t interested. I couldn’t explain it, but the woman being so close to me now was driving me insane. It was like my emotions were being gutted. The closer she got, the worse I felt. I wanted nothing more than to get away from her.

As I reached for the handle of my door, I saw the woman’s hand reach out and grab my arm before hearing her pleading,

“Please, sir, I know you don’t understand, but I need you to take this and wear it. There is-”

I pulled back my hand roughly and snapped, “Don’t you dare grab me like that you weirdo! I have no clue who the hell you are or why you want me to have your stupid Etsy project, but it’s not happening. Go find some other loser to sell your cheap junk to!”

It was as though her touch flipped a switch in me. The sadness, the gutted feeling, was replaced with anger that exploded out of me. I climbed into my truck and slammed the door. Immediately, I felt off about what I had said. Even in incredibly uncomfortable and less than favorable situations, I am always very calm and never aggressive or insulting to people. Ella, seeing how odd I acted and how upset I was, placed her hand on my arm,

“Let’s get home, ok?”

I nodded and began backing out of the parking space.

After backing out, I put my truck into drive and looked forward to now see the woman standing in the parking space we just pulled out of. In my headlights, I could see her clearly, clutching the black beads to her chest, with a face that looked like she hadn’t slept in days. As the light shined on her, I noticed something else that I hadn’t before: her eyes were filled with tears. As I looked into her sorrow-filled eyes, for a moment, I considered going and taking the necklace from her. However, this feeling was quickly replaced by the same abnormal anger I felt before.

“Crazy bitch.” I hissed under my breath before speeding off.

That night was the first night the dream came to me. The memory of it fragmented, nothing more than fading flashes. An empty void, a dark forest, a twig breaking behind me, turning to see what it was, and then waking up. Dreams are a strange thing, the memory of the dream was as though I had no feeling of fear, but upon waking from it, I was left in a cold sweat, breathing as though I had a near-death experience. I grabbed my phone and checked the time, 12 a.m. exactly.

Things started getting strange over the next few weeks. To say my luck was bad would be an understatement. It started off small, my phone would go missing only to find it a few hours later in a place I had already looked, glasses being too close to the edge of the counter and falling off, those sorts of things.

As time went on though, the misfortune became more serious. I’d get ready for work only to spend 30 minutes looking for my keys only to realize my wallet is now missing right after I found the keys, making me late and putting me in bad standings with my boss. I would go to submit an assignment for one of my college classes just to find the files I was using somehow got corrupted and I would have to start all over. I even had weird stuff like multiple birds flying into my windows and breaking their necks, something that always upset me as a big animal lover. These things happened sparsely in the first few weeks, but after the first month they became more frequent.

Every time these misfortunes would happen, I would feel anger and sadness welling up more and more. All of this was further fed by tiredness that came from being woken up every few days at exactly the same time by a dream that made no sense. Once those emotions subsided, I would be left with a growing emptiness in me. I’m ashamed to say it, but the stress and anger lead me to push everyone away. I suddenly had no time for friends and little time for Ella. When I was around the people I cared for I was left with this deflated feeling that made me a husk of the happy person I once was. After 2 months, I felt like I had become a completely different person.

I have never believed in the paranormal. I loved the idea of ghosts and spirits, but I never believed those things could actually exist. I chalked up what was happening to me as a string of bad luck mixed with mood swings from stress and lack of sleep. Ella was the first one to suggest something paranormal might be happening. Unlike me, Ella was actually open-minded to the idea of paranormal stuff and even believed in it to at least some extent. With my terrible luck and even worse mood, she wondered if I somehow got into something bad. I don’t know if she fully believed it herself or if she was grasping at anything to get her boyfriend back.

“There are a lot of things in this world that we can’t explain, and tons of people have encounters with things that they swear are otherworldly. What if something is messing with you?” Ella said, showing me an article on curses and hauntings.

I’m ashamed to say, but I laughed at her when she suggested it. I don’t know why I did it. I always try to hear her out on everything with an open mind, but hearing the paranormal suggested made something inside me stir. It was so out of character and mean-spirited of me, but I laughed at her

“Are you serious?” I asked sarcastically.

“Yes.”

“Ok, cool, what is it then? Was it Casper or the gnomes that kept hiding my keys?”

“I’m being serious.”

“No, you’re not.” my voice raised, “You are sitting here bringing up fairy tales and magic to explain to me why *everything* in my life sucks right now! All I want is to be left alone so I don’t have to listen to people make excuses for something that is just bad luck!”

It was a lie. I didn’t want her to go. “Why am I being such a jerk?” I thought.

“I’m just throwing out ideas. I’m trying to help you.” She said quietly.

“Well, at least I’m not the only one losing my mind.”

Immediately, I came to my senses about how awful I was being. I tried to apologize, but the damage was already done.

“If you want to be miserable, you can be,” Ella said, “but you don’t have to make everyone miserable with you.”

She stormed out while I tried backpedaling what I said, digging a hole deeper for myself.

When Ella slammed the door behind her, and I was alone in my house again, the sinking feeling of guilt was almost unbearable. I stood there for a few minutes, pacing around the kitchen, looking at my phone, debating if I should call her and try to make things right. Ella was the only person who was trying to help me, the only person who knew everything going on in my life, and I pushed her away for trying to be there for me.

“Why did you push her away?” I thought.

“You’re so pathetic. You let a little bad luck drive everyone you care about away. You’re worthless. Less than worthless. You would have more use in the ground than going on with this miserable excuse for a life.”

I had never been suicidal in my whole life. These thoughts… they were alien to me. Yet for a moment, they made sense. My head was flooded with images, all the ways I could do it. Feeling that way, hearing the voice in my head say these things, it was terrifying.

The depression and guilt I felt in that moment was almost unbearable. I put my phone back in my pocket and I fell on my hands and knees and sobbed. And there, in my sorrow, grief, and self-pity, I noticed something. The room… seemed darker.

No… not the whole room. Just a small area shadowed around me.

“What?” I gasped, looking at the strange shadow around me. It didn’t make any sense; I was lying right under the kitchen light. The only way there could be a shadow around me was if… someone was behind me blocking the light. Immediately, a feeling came to the forefront of my mind. One that I had been experiencing for weeks but was so faint, I didn’t even notice until now, I was being watched, and whoever it was is right behind me.

I spun around with my hands in front of me. I expected to see some person dressed in all black with a knife or gun, but instead, I was faced with nothing but the glaring light bulb of the kitchen light fixture. The shadow was gone, but the feeling of not being alone was stronger than ever. I shot to my feet, my still-wet eyes jittering around the room, looking for a sign of anyone.

“Who’s there!?” I shouted, trying to sound threatening even though whoever would have been there was just listening to me cry like a toddler.

“I’m not messing around! I know someone is here! Come out and face me!” I demand.

I really, *really* wish I hadn’t.

After I finished speaking, I heard something in my kitchen cabinet, the sound of glass breaking. At first, it was a small *crack. crack. crack*. Then I heard a glass shatter, then another. “What the hell,” I whispered in a shaking voice, frozen, unable to comprehend the impossibility of what was happening.

Suddenly, the cabinet flew open, and shreds of broken plates and glasses were thrown out towards me. I ducked when the cabinet door opened so most of the glass missed me, but a few shards managed to land on the top of me and left a few cuts on my scalp and arms. Immediately, I ran out of the kitchen and into my bedroom.

Even though I couldn’t see it, I could feel it, its presence, it was inches behind me as I ran. It was like I could feel heat radiating off of it as I ran through the entrance to my bedroom, slamming and locking the door. I moved inside the bathroom to find something to treat my cuts. I reached for my phone. I needed to call the police, to call Ella, to call anyone who could come and help me. My phone was gone. “What? No. No no…” I whimpered as I patted myself all over, looking for my phone. I had put it in my pocket; where the hell could it have gone?

As I looked over my bedroom for my phone, a loud thud came from my door, followed by another, and another. The thuds were getting louder, and I could see the door start to buckle and shake under weight of whatever was doing this. I knew whatever the thing was, it was going to get into the bedroom eventually. In my desperation, I locked myself in the bathroom with the lights turned off. I heard the bedroom door crack and then break open. The silence that followed the sound of the door breaking was maddening.

I couldn’t hear footsteps or breathing. I could see from under the door the light of the bedroom flicker before hearing the bulb shatter as I was drowned in complete darkness. The immersing silence was broken by the sound of the doorknob to the bathroom being tested gently, followed by three quiet taps.

“Please. I don’t know what you want. I don’t know what I did wrong. I’m sorry.” I cried softly, “Please. Just leave me alone. I just want you to leave me alone.” 

My pleads were met with the sound of something hitting the door hard before falling to the ground. At first, I wondered what it could have thrown at the door, but my question was answered a few minutes later as a familiar ringtone filled the quiet room. It was my phone. What’s more, the ringtone was a special ringtone I set up for when Ella calls me. The help I needed was calling me. All I had to do was open the door and answer. Maybe it was waiting right outside the door or maybe it had already left the room. There was no way for me to know. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t open that door. My help would have to wait. I bandaged myself up the best I could before I laid on the cold floor and cried until all the energy left my body and I somehow fell asleep. There, I dreamed.

I was falling, falling through a black void. I could see my body, but everything around me was as black as an empty night sky. I’ve never had a fear of heights, but I’ve never been the most comfortable around them either. Fear of the eventual sudden stop grew and grew as I plummeted. I screamed as I fell. I pictured my friends, my family, I pictured Ella. I didn’t want to die.

Suddenly, the rushing wind on my back and feeling of falling stopped. Replaced with the crunchy cushion of dead leaves and the chirping of crickets while I looked up at a forest canopy covering a bright night sky. It was as if I was never falling to begin with. I stood to my feet, the fear of the falling and the memory of the presence in my home still weighing on me. However, in the calm of the forest I remembered that I had been here before, almost every night. The falling, the forest, it has plagued my mind every day for weeks. Only this time, it was clearer, I had more understanding of where I was and that I was asleep on the bathroom floor.

*crunch*

I remembered this. A noise approaching from behind, one that if I turned to face, the dream would end, a mistake I didn’t want to make.

*crunch*

As the noise drew closer, my fear grew. However, the presence behind me had an air of calm, of peace, of comfort. It felt different from the thing I was running from moments ago.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked

*crunch*

“Please. Just let me go.” I cried, “I just want to be ok again.”

Behind me, I heard a voice, a voice from my memory that I had forgotten. A voice whose memory shot to the forefront of my mind.  The voice of the woman from the renaissance faire.

“Come find me.” She said sternly.

“How can I find you, Maria?”

 Maria? I knew her name. She never told it to me, but I knew it somehow.

“Come find me.” She said again.

I turned to face her only to wake up on the bathroom floor. I didn’t know how long I had been asleep for, but I needed to get out of the house. I needed to get to Ella. She could help me find Maria. I opened the bathroom door, picking up my phone and checking the time, 12:12 a.m. My room was a mess, my bedroom door was broken open, my pillows and bed were shredded. All the lamps and light bulbs in the room were broken, a pattern I assumed would spread throughout the house. As I moved out of the bedroom, I opened my phone to call Ella. She wouldn’t like being woken up, but she would understand. As I rounded the corner into my kitchen, I dropped my phone in the shock of what I saw. In my mind, I assumed this presence that was tormenting me was formless. Something that could physically affect things but not be seen. I don’t know why I thought this, but that assumption was dashed as I looked at the monster in front of me.

The thing stood between me and the door leading to the garage. It was tall enough to have to hunch over to stand in my kitchen, making it well over 8 feet tall. Despite its height, the being was unnaturally slender, having the same width dimensions of an average thin person. Its skin, if you can call it skin, was like ink. It looked wet and oily, a light from the street shimmered off of its black form. Its head was shaped similar to a bird's. It was round, with what looked like a hooked beak over what I can only assume is a wide gaping mouth with no teeth.

I turned to run, too afraid to even scream. Before I had even made three steps towards the back door, the creature had grabbed me. Its long, slender hands had wrapped around my head and pulled me back, forcing me onto my back. I could feel it now; its skin was slick and wet, like grabbing at latex covered in dish soap. It placed its hand in my mouth and forced it open. I could taste it, like the taste when you accidentally breathe in sunscreen mixed with cinnamon. Then I felt it, a pouring into my mouth. It was as though the thing was melting down my throat. I choked, I cried, but I couldn’t move. Even as the monster shrank and melted into me, I could still feel its strength holding me down. Eventually, the stress of the situation became too much, and I passed out.

When I woke up on the floor the next morning, I felt like I had the worst chest congestion possible. I jumped to my feet and coughed over the sink, coughing up a mixture of phlegm, blood, and a black oily substance. I called Ella and told her that I needed to see her in public right then. I told her that I was sorry for what I said and that she was right and that I needed her help more than ever. She could have said no, she could have called me crazy, but she didn’t. She just asked how she could help. I assumed the thing knew more people would get involved if it started throwing things around in public and since it waited until Ella left the other night before lashing out, I imagined it didn’t want more people involved. So, I figured being in public would be my best shot at keeping it restrained.

I met up with Ella at a coffee shop and explained everything to her: the cuts, the dream, what the thing did to me. I don’t think she fully believed me at first, but her mind changed when I coughed up the strange black liquid into a napkin.

“I think it’s trying to break me down,” I said.

“Why? What does it need you broken down for?”

“I have no clue, but it’s working. I’m not myself anymore, even you’ve noticed that.”

Ella sipped her coffee, “And how do you feel now?”

“Terrible.”

“How so?”

“It makes me want to die.”

“What?” Ella’s eyes widened, setting her coffee down.

“Yeah. Like when you left the other night. I think the thing was trying to convince me to…” I hung my head. Unable to finish the sentence.

“What about that woman?” Ella asked.

“Maria? I don’t know. She has been there since it started, though.” I answered.

“Do you think she could have started all this?”

“Maybe. Or maybe she wants to stop it. All I know is that she wants me to find her. So that is what we’re going to do.”

It took a while of scouring Facebook and Instagram before we found her, turns out there are a lot of Marias in my area. But eventually, there she was, Maria Windsor. Her page was filled with spiritualist crafts and inspirational messages. She looked happier in her pictures than how I remembered seeing her, but it was her. I sent her a friend request and within a few minutes she accepted and sent a message. It was an address with the words, “Get here quickly.”

When we arrived at the address, we saw it was just an ordinary house in a completely unassuming neighborhood. Despite its unassuming nature, the thing that had latched onto me did not like me being there. The coughing was getting worse and worse the closer I got to the house. Walking up to her front door was an ordeal in and of itself. Eventually, I stopped at the steps to the door. I couldn’t catch my breath; I couldn’t stop coughing and spitting up that vile black liquid. At a certain point, I questioned if this was how I would die, on the doorstep of a mystery I would never understand. As my vision started to go dark, I saw the door to the house open and the fuzzy image of a woman approaching me.

When I came to, I was lying on a couch with Ella staring at me from across the room with a worried expression. Sitting on the coffee table in front of me was Maria.

“It’s nice to see you again, Mason,” Maria said with a small smile.

“Maria..?” I groaned, still waking up.

“Here, drink this.” She said, handing me a glass of water.

I sat up and took the water from her. It was then that I noticed the necklace of black beads around my neck.

“You got here just in time. Any later and it would have started fully taking you.” Maria said, her voice very matter of fact and direct.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Some say evil spirit, some say demon. It’s something non-human, not from our plane. Something that hates us.”

“Us?” I asked.

“Humans.” She replied quickly. “It hates people.”

“Why?”

Maria shrugged, “Who knows. It could be a number of reasons, but *it* and things like it don’t usually speak to us candidly with people.”

“What does it want?” I asked quietly.

“Your death.” Her words cut me like a knife.

I looked around the rooms. It was filled with oddities like crystals, incense burners, sigils, herbs, and different colored strings. I could also see religious paraphernalia scattered throughout the room, things like crucifixes, rosary beads, and what I assume was holy water.

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Someone who wants to help you.”

“But why?”

“Because I know what it’s like to lose someone to this thing. And I don’t want to see anyone else suffer because of it.” Maria looked at Ella, who was clearly still shaken up from what had happened on the doorstep.

I reached up and touched the necklace. I could almost feel warmth radiating off of it.

“This wards it off,” I muttered. “That’s why you were trying to give it to me?”

Maria frowned, “It would have. But judging by the black shit you’re coughing up I’m going to go out on a limb and say the thing has already infested you. At this point, all it does is weaken it.”

“How did you reach me in my dream?” I asked.

“Astral projection.” She said. “I tried almost every night to reach you. The problem is the spirit is a strong one and it would block our link. Your girlfriend filled me in on the night I was able to reach you. My guess, the spirit used up too much energy torturing you and it wasn’t strong enough to block the link.”

“What can we do to fix this?” I asked.

“At this point,” Maria said, “The spirit is too close to taking you over. We’re going to have to get it out of you by force.”

I had seen and heard of exorcisms in all sorts of fictional media. I never believed it was a real thing, let alone that one day I would be the one strapped to a table shirtless with what I can only assume is a witch and my girlfriend standing around me. The room was decorated with more oddities than the living room was. The two doors in and out of the room had ornate crucifixes hanging over them and the whole room was lined with red string. The shelves in the room were covered in bottles filled with different herbs and spices, and the edges of the floor were covered in a pristine line of salt.

“This will be a very unpleasant experience for you,” Maria said somberly. “Your mind will be taken closer to the spirit’s world. You will see and feel things that are imperceivable to us. It will be a lot to take in. But that is why it is good that she’s here.” Maria said this while looking at Ella. “She’ll keep you grounded.”

Despite the gravity of the words Maria was speaking to me, her cadence and delivery were like that of a doctor describing an invasive surgery to a patient. She spoke like she had done this many times before.

I squeezed Ella’s hand. “I’m ready.”

Maria winced in a way that told me I wasn’t.

“Then let’s begin.” She said calmly.

Maria began to burn incense and chant quietly in a language that I couldn’t understand. I gave Ella a worried glance just before the smell of the incense accosted my nose. Neither Maria nor Ella reacted to the smell, but to me, it reeked of rot and spoiled milk. I could feel its smoke burning in my lungs. The smell was accompanied by an equally strange sight. The room suddenly looked as though everything was completely covered in shadow. It reminded me of when your phone is on, but you don’t touch it for a long time and the screen goes dim before turning off. The sight and smell were enough to freak me out. I was breathing heavily and squeezed Ella’s hand tighter as she looked down at me with a nervous stare.

After a few minutes of this, I began to feel a stirring in my chest. I needed to cough, but I couldn't sit up to cough the mess in my lungs out of me. Then I felt it, a pressing on my chest. When I looked down though, I realized it wasn’t something pressing on my chest, it was something inside of my chest pressing out. I could feel the subtle touch of fingertips rubbing against the inside of my ribcage. “What the hell is that!?” I whispered. Maria continued her chanting, and Ella just squeezed my hand, looking at the spot on my chest that I was looking.

I could now feel what felt like the palm of someone’s hand pushing up on my ribcage. The discomfort it caused was unnatural. I lurched on the table and let out a yell. Maria’s chants grew louder as Ella stumbled back, frightened by my screams. I looked down to now see several small pointy objects pushing out the skin between my ribs. I screamed out and looked away as black inky fingertips broke through the skin with a hideous pop, I could feel small streams of liquid streaming down my sides. The strangest thing was that, despite feeling the pressure, there was no pain coming from the wounds, only the mental anguish from watching my own body’s mutilation. I watched in horror as the fingers retreated back into my chest as I felt two palms now pressing up on the inside of my chest. After a few more moments of hearing nothing but my screaming and Maria’s chanting a new horrifying sound came to my ears, cracking.

I could hear my ribs breaking inside of me as the pushing continued. I couldn’t bear to look down as I heard the tearing of my skin, sounding like dull knives going through wet leather. I looked around the room in panicked agony to see Maria and Ella with sprays of my blood across them. However, Maria kept chanting and Ella stayed still. As I felt my chest open more, I could also now feel something much bigger than hands pushing through.

I looked down just in time to see the head and shoulders of the spirit push from my mangled torso with an awful screech, my crimson blood running off its shining black exterior. Its piercing cry made my ears ring out in pain, the first true pain I had felt since the exorcism began. The pain from the demon’s scream worked its way down my body. It was as though it woke up a part of me so I could now feel the pain radiating from the damage it had done to my chest. I closed my eyes and screamed out in pain, begging for the anguish to stop, wondering if there was any way out. When I opened my eyes, the being was bent down over me, half of its body still submerged in me. its abominable head just inches from mine. I could feel its offer running through my soul. It would take the pain away, it would end the suffering, all it wanted was for me to give it control.

For a moment, I wanted to say yes. I wanted to end this nightmare. To get away from everything. Death was preferable to me than this. I tensed my mouth, prepared to scream my answer, to let it know that it had won; to let it know it had broken me. Then, in all the pain and agony, I felt a familiar warm hand gently grab my arm. I looked to see Ella, with tears streaming down her face, knelt down beside me and speaking softly to me. “Keep going. Please.” She said through broken cries. “I need you to keep going for me. I love you, Mason.” As I looked into her eyes, for just a moment, I felt the pain leave and a calmness wash over me. In that brief moment, I mustered the strength to whisper four simple words, “I want to live.”  I screamed out a cry of pain as the demon trashed back and screeched at my answer, the rest of its torso and legs forming from the black sludge that filled my chest. I watched as the spirit rose up out of me and dissipated into black mist in the air. My vision grew dark, and I watched the world go black.

As I shot upright on the couch, my hands instinctively went to my chest. I could feel my heart beating quickly against my perfectly intact ribs, no dried blood or scars in sight. I looked up, confused, just in time to see a sobbing Ella jump on me and hugged me so tightly that I struggled to breathe.

“You did good,” Maria said, sipping what looked like tea from across the room.

I struggled to speak “I… I saw it… It ripped… How am I...”

“What you saw and felt was the purging of your spirit. Things that we couldn’t perceive. To us, you were just thrashing and screaming”

“So, it’s really gone?” Ella asked.

“For him it is,” Maria sighed. “Unfortunately, keeping something like that out of our plane permanently is much more difficult.”

“Thank you, Maria,” I muttered.

Maria nodded and went back into her kitchen.

For the most part, life went back to normal after that. I had to really patch things up with my boss and push myself like crazy to catch back up in school, but I managed, especially with Ella and my friends by my side. I could have given up. I could have let it win. But I didn’t. I pushed forward and found hope. Hope in the ones I love, and the ones that love me.

I can't buy the Go right now, although it might be a good cheap option for my small kitchen.

I'm waiting for someone to recommend the Neo Flex, but is it worth it? If I want to buy, for example, a normal tamper, a mirror and a case, then that will be the cost of the Pro 3, which has all this included, and even made of metal. Also, the Pro 3 seems to be more compact than the Neo Flex, or is it just me, does anyone have both models for comparison?

At the same time, I often see that the Pro 2 was better than the Pro 3 and than the 58. Like, more consistent results. So, the 58 only makes sense for collectors of all coffee equipment and those who are afraid of losing 7-8 degrees Celsius in their chamber? And in terms of size and price, the 58 doesn't really win.

(She told me once I'd have to live on my own, needless to say I very much imploded and almost died) I know I don't handle stress well, I KNOW THAT, that's why I try to avoid stressful things. But everybody in my life keeps telling me to push myself farther than I can manage realistically and that's annoying. No. It makes me sad honestly. Earlier this year and late last year I was diagnosed with a dissociative disorder and mid-high level support autism. 

I just wish people wouldn't see them as just names, and realise that I need help with things actually. There are days where things are so overwhelming that i shut down, that i cant take showers because everything feels like static and my own tears are crawling on my skin. 

This is the whole reason my parents and I are going to court, because I'm not self sufficient, and I don't say that to be down on my self. I'm being real, I can order coffee, and I manage to go to school about 3-4 times a week, but that's really it. I learned recently that there was a reason for my frustration.

 I was born early, like, the Monday of 26 weeks, NICU for almost a year, early, oxygen untill I was 3, couldnt go anywhere cause id get sick and sick means ER early. and It never clicked to me that, I missed every milestone untill I was 10, mentally and physically. I may or may not be crying while writing this, you'll never know, but im so happy to know that, I'm NOT overreacting, that I was born inherently different and that I grew up in a completely separate, but f**ed up situation that I never should've been a part of.

Good morning all! I hope everyone is doing well and getting through the work day! I’m here enjoying my second (maybe third?) cup of coffee and would love some company. Join me and let’s be friends or soulmates or whatever we become!

A little about me. I’m a tall, glasses wearing brown haired guy working in the legal field, though I don’t get into any courtroom dramatics. My username here comes from my cinematic hero and all around icon Elle Woods. I enjoy my job, which is mostly research and writing, but I think some people might think it’s boring.

In my spare time, I really enjoy reading and enjoying nature. I’m always up for a book recommendation or a good hike. I love to bake as well, though I’m definitely not ready for the tent yet. I just enjoy trying to make tasty things to give to friends and family. I play board games and D&D when I can. I like to write fiction. I’m too big a LotR nerd. I speak two languages with various degrees of “this would offend a native speaker,” guess what they are! (One might be more obvious!)

Если вы говорите по-русский, давай говорим! Но я говору очень плохо по-русский.

If any of that resonates with you, reach out! Let’s pass the time, be friends, fall in love, whatever happens!

This same night my heart went up to 138 while simply showering. I’ve had more experiences but I’ll try to keep this short.

I weigh around 140 pounds and I’m not super athletic but I walk everyday for at least an hour usually 2. My mom does have SVT so she might’ve passed it down to me maybe? I’ve never tested. I do have anxiety but unless it was subconscious I wasn’t anxious about anything during the episodes I mentioned.

We picked a fantastic care home, but was always unsure how she’d take to it. 

Dropped her off on the Friday, and visited her in the evening to take her pills. She was so happy, the happiest I’d seen her in years. She waved to me with delight from the dining room window and when I went up, she’d just eaten fish and was emphasising how tasty it was!

I said goodbye, and me and my partner went to visit her on the Sunday where she was a completely different person. “It’s not what we thought it was.” “I want to go home!” And was in a state of distress. I told her that she couldn’t go home, we were going abroad for a few weeks, and she wouldn’t be able to look after herself. She just argued she’s looked after herself before and could do it again. But she wouldn’t be able to.

I spoke to one of the nurses who was surprised, said that she’s been talking to the other residents and laughing with them. She went to talk to my grandma where she just said “well I just can’t do what I’d normally do.” To which I later explained to the nurse that she just sits at home all day staring into space.

I was stressed for the few weeks after that, wondering how she was getting on. My partner just thinks she was trying to guilt trip us, which I agree she’s done it before.

But I went to pick her up yesterday, she looked so well, she was really excited to see me, but leaving the building became impossible whilst she said goodbye to the nurses and other residents. She was so smiley, happy, laughing with some, dancing with others, and being like her old, caring self to some of the others who were worse than her.

We had an incline she was going to come back worse, as she has been declining rapidly for months even before respite, but especially being in full time care. But we didn’t expect it as bad as this.

She’s wet herself in the night quite severely as she won’t change her continence underwear as often as she needs to, and won’t let us help. She’d had an incident like this before she went away and we deep cleaned her bedroom. She got up about 08:30 this morning and had just stood staring in the kitchen for 45 minutes really confused. We think she’s now forgotten how to make her breakfast. And her neighbour came to visit her for their routine coffee morning, so me and my partner went to work for a couple of hours (we run a family business) and when we came back, she’s pretty much had a “poonami” and got it everywhere, unsure what was going on and why we were trying to rush her into the shower.

I calmly suggested to her that I think she needs to go into that home permanently, which I actually thought she’d agree, but instead became aggressive towards me and I’ve now spent the last couple of hours avoiding her. 

I hate this disease and as horrible as it sounds I just wish it would come to an end. She has no life anymore and it’s heartbreaking. I hope her daycare that she normally goes to on a Tuesday cheers her up tomorrow",13,1742827188.0,dementia,10,1.0,False

English is not my first language so sorry about some mistakes

So I(22M) have an ex(23F), we dated for a year and a half in high school, and we broke up at the end of the senior year over 5 years ago. We talked a lot during the breakup and were on good terms, but had no contact until last week, when she messaged me on Instagram at 4 AM asking if I still lived in my hometown (which I do). She then said she’d like to talk, but it would have to be in person when she comes back here (for context, I’ve been in a relationship for 3 years, and my girlfriend knows about this conversation and actually encouraged me to meet up). So we agreed to meet for coffee.

Up to this point, everything seemed a bit random and strange, but nothing felt too serious just an ex wanting to talk about life. Until yesterday.

Encouraged by my girlfriend and some friends, I decided to ask what she wanted to talk about. She said it wasn’t anything important, just talking about the changes in her life and the ones she’d heard about in mine (all normal up to this point). Then, after a few minutes, she confessed that she was becoming an alcoholic, and the day she messaged me, some bad things had happened (which she didn’t specify) and that’s what motivated her to reach out. She also said that with other people, she could express herself sober, but with me, it would be different and that the conversation would have to involve alcohol, which contradicts everything she had said so far about this just being a simple chat about life changes. She said all of this in a very confusing way, and I still didn’t fully understand the conversation even after rereading it a few times.

As I mentioned earlier, we broke up amicably, and I wouldn’t mind seeing her and talking, but this last talk left me feeling anxious and slightly uncomfortable, making me question if this meeting would be good for both of us.

tl;dr: My ex, who I haven't talked to in years, reached out to meet up. She confessed she's becoming an alcoholic and wants to talk to me, which made me feel anxious. Now I'm unsure if meeting is a good idea.

<div>Creating an inviting and stylish men's decor apartment involves a blend of functionality, minimalism, and personality. The goal is to curate an environment that reflects your tastes while being practical for everyday life. Here are some essential tips to achieve a sophisticated yet functional living space.

### 1. Color Palette

Choosing the right color palette is crucial in men's decor. Opt for neutral tones such as grays, blacks, and whites, which provide a sleek and modern backdrop. Accents of bolder colors like navy, forest green, or burgundy can add depth and intrigue.

### 2. Furniture Choices

Stick to furniture that emphasizes clean lines and functional design. Consider investing in:

- Leather or suede sofas that offer comfort and style.
- Coffee tables made of metal or reclaimed wood for an industrial touch.
- Multipurpose ottomans or storage benches to reduce clutter.

### 3. Wall Art and Decor

Incorporate wall art that resonates with your interests. From abstract paintings to framed photographs of urban landscapes, these elements add character. Shelving units can display books and collectibles, enhancing the personal appeal of your space.

### 4. Lighting Solutions

Layer your lighting to create atmosphere. Utilize floor lamps with industrial designs and pendant lights with metallic finishes for a modern edge. Dimmer switches enhance mood and can make your apartment feel more inviting during gatherings.

### 5. Plants and Greenery

Integrating plants such as succulents or snake plants brings a touch of nature indoors. These low-maintenance options are perfect for busy lifestyles and improve air quality, creating a vibrant atmosphere.

Ultimately, a well-thought-out men's decor apartment reflects personal style while serving practical needs. Pay attention to details, and you will create a space that is both stylish and comfortable.

Lately, Copilot Edits has been giving me a ridiculous amount of issues, and I'm starting to wonder if it's just me or if others are experiencing the same thing.

Here’s what’s been happening:

* Copilot Edits sometimes just stops responding mid-conversation. When it was ready to modify a file. No 'working...' indicator either, just looks like its finished.
* Copilot Edits managed to edit filename <index.js> and somehow thought it was in a separate folder. Leaving me with two index.js's (only one being called).
* Editing so slow you could take a shower, make a coffee, and still come back just in time to watch it struggle with line 50.
* Making multiple edits on the same file simultaneously, turning it into a complete mess.

Anyone here available this week to help a 5'1, 24-year old guy to experience sex once again? I'm a working professional, grad from big 4 (if it matters to you), hygienic and neat looking. We did it with condom last time so I'm safe naman. You'll be the 2nd person to fuck me if ever and this will also be my second time in bed. Living around qc and willing to travel din.

I have no preference as long as you're a female, nice and willing to teach me in bed (since I have little to no experience pa) I'm good with that.

I'm also down for long term fwb setup and I can be also be your travel, coffee, gaming and concert buddy. I'm not forcing anyone since I'm not confident with my height.

It's easily possible.,"Preface to say we don't have kids and this was about 4 years ago. Obviously I understand buying on your own is much more difficult and I also understand that buying property is much more expensive and difficult than it used to be many moons ago. 

There are constantly posts on here asking about how people bought their first houses and how it's impossible for young people to get on the property ladder. So I figured I'd explain how we did it. We really didnt find it that difficult. 

No, we didn't receive any inheritance or lottery winnings, the only things our families helped us with were one or two appliances. We both owned cheap cars outright. Had no significant debts and both saved £100 a month each more or less depending on outgoings for about 4 /5 years while renting. We were even still able to afford modest holidays. We bought a 2 up 2 down starter home for £160k that needed nothing doing to it with a 5% deposit and a 35 year mortgage. Granted that isn't the best 35 years and 95% LTV isn't the best situation to be in but it was a first step onto the property ladder.  We even had some money left over to buy furniture etc after moving in. 

People make fun of others when they talk about cancelling things like netflix and not getting takeaway coffees but realistically when you're literally only saving £100 a month a netflix subscription of £15 and 4 coffees a month at £4 that's already 30% of your monthly target saved cutting out those two expenses. We were just careful with what we spent money on. 

After a few years of living in our first we are now upsizing using the equity gained to purchase a new house and take some years off our mortgage. 

I know people's personal circumstances vary drastically but for the average couple it's definitely doable, you just need to be consistent. ",0,1742826325.0,HousingUK,29,0.32,False

My concern is in regard with my in laws house and the possible impact it could have on our health and young children's health.

1. They wear their shoes inside on carpets/stone floors/hard wood floors. Shoes they wear in grocery stores and HOSPITALS. My children will end up crawling and putting their hands in their mouths afterwards.

2. Grocery bags that were in shopping carts go on the kitchen counters, where food is prepared and where we eat. Then she takes her dishcloth that she washed dishes with, wipes the entire kitchen counters with it, not just the one that the grocery bags were on, but under coffee machines and everything, and washes dishes with it, in a nice soapy grayish water pool.

Well that's it, but i feel like things can go wrong in any of these instances.

hundreds or thousands

This morning emerges  

from sleepless nights,  
  
poorly slept and unfinished.  
  
So many are the dreams   
 
that fill a night without sleep.   
 
And so many are the certainties   
 
that fill these dreams.

violently,    

like someone who crashes a car,   

at a hundred kilometers per hour,  

against a wall,   

and gets thrown through the windshield,  
  
colliding aggressively,    

shaking every bone,    

ricocheting the brain within the skull,     
 
fracturing five ribs,  
 
piercing the left lung.  
  
I am launched into life,  
  
into the brutal lack of certainty,  
  
alongside the dismantling  
 
of the dream.  
 
A cruel freebie.

Every poem is useless.  
  
Yes, even this poem.  

Even this one.  
  
So many different poems,  
  
yet the same as this,  
  
and so many identical poems,  
 
yet so different.  
  
But all useless,  
  
unforgivably useless.  
  

///////////////////////////////////

Every poem is a lost battle.  

But a battle,  
  
nonetheless.  
  
A small, submissive rebellion,  
 
that crushes   
   
and ends itself,  
 
in the very lines it wrote.  
  
An attempt at living,  
 
that ends in the suicide

Final revolt.

But I will do differently.  
  
These verses of mine   
  
will not be an attempt   
  
to live,

metrical

get the lyrical self to live.

Unhappy accident,

you are a defective project,

demiurge.

So I won’t take you seriously.  
 
I will rise, defiant,  
  
from this chair  

and scream, “To hell with it!”   
  
I will throw this coffee   
 
against the wall,  

staining the white plaster   
  
with bitterness.  
  
The coffee’s? No,  

the soul’s,  
 
like a child who,  
  
rejected by its parents,  
 
cries in tantrum.  

 ///////////////////////////////////

In the end, I will do none of this.  

I resign myself,  
 
to the prison of the chair  
  
and the chains of the pen.  
  
I will resign myself,  

to the pain of living,  
 
to pathetic socializing,  

to the superficial   
  
""good morning,""   

that masks   
 
a silent cry for help,  
  
each morning,  
 
from every person,  
  
shallow and meaningless,  
  
I know.  
  
In the end,  
 
I will keep writing verses,  

that scream in silence.

Useless. Perhaps all was useless.  
  
Not perhaps—certainly.

And now, I am nothing.  
 
How did I fail   
 
to write the lyrics  
  
of a Sappho,  
 
to lead the grand campaigns  
  
of an Artemisia,  

or to hold in my chest   

the divine call   
 
of a Joan of Arc?  
  
Or even, perhaps,  

to have been   
  
a successful man,  
  
of the riches   
  
of a Mansa Musa,  

or the megalomaniac plans   
  
of an Alexander?  
 
///////////////////////////////////

No, the world was made   
  
for those who dare   
  
to challenge it,  

not for those   
  
who challenge it silently,  
  
in verses, thoughts,  
 
or sleepless dreams.  
 
///////////////////////////////////

I read all the books on ontology, ethics,  

and teleology,  

yet found no answers in them.  
  
I then sought the solution in love,  
  
that mystical feeling,  
  
but found only   

addiction to oxytocin and dopamine.  
  
Then I sought religion,  
 
and found only the repetition   
  
of what I’d heard so many times,  
  
and saw in it only reflections   
  
of all people,  
  
imperfect and alike.  

I wrapped myself in the cloak of ideological idealism,  
  
but found in it the same   

as in religion,  
  
and the lazy Platonism   

of perfect ideas   
 
shattered before me.  
  
Since then, I wander,  
  
without meaning, without direction.  
  
///////////////////////////////////

Yet I hold within me a satisfaction,  

the satisfaction of having the last laugh.  
  
All great people,  
  
in their end,  

will be as irrelevant  
  
as the small ones,  
 
the difference being  
 
that they made their lives   
  
a kind of bet, lost,  
  
on immortality.  
  
But at my end,  
  
I will leave at least  
 
a positive balance:  

I killed within me the prophet   
  
and the idol,  
  
so I placed no bets,  

and lost nothing.  
  
///////////////////////////////////

I keep drinking my coffee.  
  
If only I had sugar   
  
to mask the bitterness of life.  
  
We spend our lives  
  
coating, coating  
  
with sugar.  
 
Every sweet coffee  
 
is merely metaphysics   
  
or hedonism.  
  
///////////////////////////////////

Here, friend,  
 
take this sweetened coffee.  

You cry all week,  
 
but on Saturday night  
 
you will forget  
 
your sorrows,  
 
and go to an orgy,  
 
drinking like Bacchus,  
 
dancing like a lunatic.  
  
On Sunday morning,  
  
you will attend Mass  
  
to hear God’s comforting word,  
  
and receive forgiveness   
  
for your sins.  
  
Sugar, all sugar,  

to sweeten the pain.  
 
///////////////////////////////////

One day, the cup will empty.  
 
And I will die, just as  
  
my friend,  

the Bacchus, the Saint,  
 
the field worker who harvested the cane,  
  
the owner of the coffee plantation,  
 
the language of these verses,  
  
and, in the end, the world  
  
and the galaxy  

where this coffee was brewed.  
 
I once thought that, in death,  
 
I would finally find  
  
relief from all suffering.  
 
But even that, I no longer know,  
  
and perhaps death  

contains just another life   
  
to be lived,  
 
and with it, more misery.  

///////////////////////////////////

If I can find no escape  

in living or dying,  
  
perhaps I will do both.  
 
As one who rejects all,  
 
life and death,  
  
heaven and hell,  
  
pain and pleasure,  

and embraces neither nothingness  
  
nor everything,  

but both instead.  

///////////////////////////////////

I’ll buy another coffee,  

and I’ll savor   
  
its bitterness,  
 
with all the peace  

of one who has already died,  
 
and I’ll finish it   
  
with all the joy   
 
of one who has already lived.

Lately, I’ve been questioning everything about our relationship. Something changed, but I don’t know exactly when—maybe five years ago?

He’s always had habits that weren’t ideal—smoking weed like 7 joints per day, drinking alcohol every day, and drinking 6-7 cups of coffee—but lately, they’ve spiraled out of control. He doesn’t eat well, doesn’t take care of himself, and only showers once a week. Sometimes he smells, and I’ve had to tell him he needs to shower because it’s just disgusting. I’ve talked to him about this countless times, and he’ll make changes for about two weeks, but then he always falls right back into the same pattern.

I even suggested therapy, thinking he might be depressed. He went for a month, then quit, saying it was a waste of time and money. We barely have sex—maybe once a month—and when we do, he often can’t even get hard.

One of my biggest breaking points was when I caught him smoking in the garage. From the very beginning, I made it clear that if he was going to smoke, it had to be outside—never inside the house. That was the rule. And for a long time, he followed it. But the other day, I walked into the garage and saw him smoking there. The entire house, including our baby’s playroom, reeked of weed. I lost it. I pushed him and yelled, “Are you stupid? How hard is it to smoke outside?” I know I shouldn’t have reacted that way, but I felt like he had no respect for me or our child.

I tolerated all of this when it was just the two of us, but now that we have a baby, I’m realizing I don’t want my child exposed to this. I’ve been in therapy for six months because I feel miserable—like I’m not happy at all despite having everything I once thought I wanted.

A few days ago, I had a realization: he doesn’t respect me or our baby. If he did, he would at least try to change. How did I let this happen? How was I so blind?

We don’t share the same interests or values anymore. He openly disrespects my family—for example, my mom is very Catholic, and out of nowhere at the dinner table, he said that people who believe in God are stupid. I told him to apologize, but he refused, saying he didn’t do anything wrong.

Even in small ways, he dismisses me. The other day, I asked him to play a song I liked, and he used a private browser on YouTube so my music wouldn’t mess up his algorithm. It sounds silly, but it hit me hard—he won’t even let a song I like touch his playlist?

I know I shouldn’t compare, but sometimes I feel jealous of my friends’ relationships.

I feel like He’s a good father, I think? He spends time with our child and helps a lot with household chores—cleaning, taking care of the dog, taking out the trash. But then I wonder… isn’t that just the bare minimum? Couldn’t I find that in a different partner without all the emotional baggage?

For context, I take care of myself. I’ve managed to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight, I’m fit, and I make sure to look after my health and appearance in every way. I know I’m a smart, hardworking woman, and yeah—I’m pretty too. But no matter how much I invest in myself, it feels like I’m stuck carrying this weight alone.

Am I overreacting? Or am I finally seeing things for what they really are? I feel like I’ve been blind for so long.
