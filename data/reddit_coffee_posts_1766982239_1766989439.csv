Written by: [Uncredited / Lost Draft]
Date: Circa 1988
Length: 22 minutes","ACT ONE
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET – MORNING
Mark and Jonathan Smith walk down a sunny street. Jonathan carries a small bag; Mark carries a toolbox. Both look slightly out of place but calm and composed.
MARK
(looking around)
San Francisco… smells like sourdough and traffic.
JONATHAN SMITH
(smiling gently)
It smells like opportunity.
MARK
(grinning)
Yeah, if opportunity needed two guys in borrowed suits and a vague explanation.
They approach a small morning talk show studio called “Wake Up, San Francisco.”
INT. “WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO” STUDIO – DAY
Danny Tanner is behind the desk, Becky is adjusting papers, prepping for the morning broadcast.
DANNY
(to Becky)
We’re short a couple of assistants this week. Shouldn’t be a problem…
A producer waves toward the door.
PRODUCER
Two temp applicants. They’re here.
Jonathan Smith and Mark walk in calmly.
BECKY
(cheerful, curious)
Hi! You’re the temps?
JONATHAN SMITH
Yes. Jonathan Smith.
MARK
Mark Gordon. Pleasure.
DANNY
(shaking hands, smiling)
Danny Tanner. And this is Becky. Welcome to chaos central.
Quick montage: Jonathan calmly organizes scripts, Mark accidentally knocks over a coffee cup but somehow fixes it before it spills. Everyone laughs.
BECKY
(whispering to Danny)
They’re… different.
DANNY
Yeah… but in a good way.
ACT TWO
INT. “WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO” STUDIO – LUNCH BREAK
Jonathan Smith and Mark sit with Danny and Becky at a small table in the studio’s break room. Light chatter from staff hums in the background.
MARK
So… do you two live around here?
DANNY
Yes. The girls are at home with Jesse right now—he’s keeping them busy while we work.
JONATHAN SMITH
(gently smiling)
It must be lively with three girls.
BECKY
(laughs)
Lively is one word. Chaotic is another.
Danny glances at Jonathan and Mark, thinking.
DANNY
Hey… why don’t you two come over for dinner tonight? Meet the girls. Could be fun.
MARK
(grinning)
Food? Count me in.
JONATHAN SMITH
(nodding politely)
We’d be honored.
INT. TANNER LIVING ROOM – EVENING
The house is full of warmth. Jesse and Joey are there, teasing the newcomers. Jonathan quietly observes, Mark joking around with Michelle.
JESSE
So, you two just… wander into jobs and everyone falls in love with you?
MARK
(grinning)
Pretty much.
DANNY
(smiling, a little embarrassed)
You get used to it.
They eat dinner. Laughter and small moments of connection. Jonathan has a quiet moment with Danny while everyone else is distracted.
JONATHAN SMITH
(softly)
Danny… you’re doing an amazing job here.
DANNY
(smiling, but tired)
Thanks… it’s not always easy.
Jonathan nods, sensing Danny’s emotional strain.
ACT THREE
INT. TANNER LIVING ROOM – NIGHT
The girls are asleep. Danny sits on the couch, Jonathan Smith nearby. Mark is tidying up in the background.
DANNY
I… I just wish I knew Pam was okay. I think about her every day… I wonder if she’s proud.
JONATHAN SMITH
(calm, gentle)
Danny… she is proud. And she talks about you… and the girls… every single day.
DANNY
(confused)
How… how do you know that?
JONATHAN SMITH
Because I can hear her too.
DANNY
(almost whispering)
You… you can talk to her? Who… who are you?
JONATHAN SMITH
(softly)
I’m an angel, Danny. And I’ve come to tell you… she’s still here. Watching. Guiding. Loving.
Danny’s eyes widen in disbelief, then tears form.
🌸 Jonathan Shares Pam’s Messages
JONATHAN SMITH
She’s amazed by D.J.—how strong she’s trying to be. She wants her to know it’s okay to still be a kid.
She loves Stephanie’s humor… says she got that from you.
And Michelle… she feels her joy, even if she can’t name it yet.
DANNY
(voice shaking)
You really talk to her? She really… sees them?
JONATHAN SMITH
Every day. She’s proud of you, Danny. You kept your promise. Gave them a home full of love, even when your heart was breaking.
DANNY
(kneeling, overwhelmed)
Does she… still love me?
JONATHAN SMITH
With everything she is. Always.
Jonathan stands. Dawn begins to filter in. He prepares to leave.
JONATHAN SMITH
Danny… when you talk to her, she hears you. Always.
Danny watches, tears on his cheeks, as Jonathan walks out quietly.
ACT FOUR / EPILOGUE
INT. TANNER LIVING ROOM – MORNING
Michelle walks in, notices the empty doorway.
MICHELLE
That man said goodbye already.
Danny freezes, smiles softly, hugs the girls.
MICHELLE
Mommy likes him.
Camera slowly pulls back, sunlight fills the room. Soft orchestral music reminiscent of Highway to Heaven plays alongside a gentle Full House theme tag.
FADE OUT.

I’m in my mid-twenties, and my biological dad was never around. I’ve made peace with that. That’s not why I dislike my mom’s boyfriend. In fact, I genuinely want my mom to find a man who treats her well and is worth keeping.

My mom has been dating this man, who I’ll call Doug, for almost 20 years, and their relationship has never been stable. He has cheated on her dozens of times, had four children with four different women while they were together, and even pulled her into a throuple situation where he pitted her against another woman and then emotionally strung that woman along for years. He openly calls women “gardening tool”. That is just scratching the surface.

One of my earliest core memories of him says a lot. We were at his house playing Monopoly, and when I was about to win, he flipped the board over and said game over.

My mom believes he has changed. She says he has been working hard in therapy and is a different person now. I want that to be true for her. But from where I stand, it is hard to trust that anything is truly different. To me, he still feels controlling and manipulative, like he is wearing a mask long enough to get her to move in and take on a caretaker role for his kids.

I have tried to give him a fair chance. Last year he took me out for coffee to apologize for never building a relationship with me and for how he treated my mom. The apology did not feel sincere. It felt like something he was told to do. He actually admitted this when he said the therapist said he has no chance with my mom if he doesn’t reconcile the relationship between him and I. Since then, there has been no effort to actually show up or build anything.

In nearly 20 years, he has never bought me a birthday or Christmas present. At the same time, my mom has consistently shown up for his kids financially, emotionally, and without hesitation, like they were her own.

Recently, we had a family Christmas Eve dinner at a nice restaurant where he shows up 25 minutes late (mind you, my family has just now began to be willing to try again and include him on things) because he had to work (mind you again, he is self employed). 
Afterwards I let him come to my boyfriend’s family Christmas Eve party. While there, he commented that the patterned tights my mom was wearing were what the hoochies wore back in the day. That comment has stayed with me.

What hurts the most is watching my mom continue to accept so little after giving so much. I do not hate him because I want to. I hate that I do not feel safe trusting him, and that despite my efforts, the pattern has not changed.
I’m just not sure if I’ll ever be able to truly accept him

First post in this subreddit; sorry if this has already been asked. I'm an editorial intern at a publishing house where interns are on break for all of January. I was hoping to use this time to cram in as many informational interviews as possible, but throughout December, everyone I worked with was drowning in work and just desperately pushing toward break. It seemed rude to ask for coffee chats while everyone was so busy! So I'm wondering if January is much the same in publishing (maybe people are still putting out fires from December?), or if people have generally had time to decompress over the break and are open to informational interviews.

The common pattern I noticed among the successful ones (I call a newsletter a success when it becomes one of the top 3 revenue channels for a business) is that they have a strong ToFu and multiple subscriber sources.

While I accomplished this multiple times for the brands I have worked with, this time I want to go all in with my newsletter (it's a newsletter about newsletters.)

Readers are happy with my content in the newsletter, but I have limited discovery. So I'm solving for it like a maniac.

This is my plan for 2026 (losely held with strong bias for action, already implemented most of these):

1. Video content: Short form on YouTube and IG. Long form if this works out.
2. Webinars: Host solid 60-90 minute sessions solving my audience's problems
3. Twitter, LinkedIn: Already active here with a social capital of 10k. Will be more intentional about value and conversions.
4. Reddit: I'm aware the platform hates promotions. So I'll be selfless and share all I know and trust Redditors to dig my newsletter out.
5. Meta Ads: One of my newsletters is for coffee brewers in India. I have successfully implemented Meta ads for its growth ($0.20 CPA, 48% OR with cleaning email list daily). I will apply the same principles for this one.

I am sharing my funnel image here. No secrets, this is all I have and I all I do.

Hope this helps :)

For context, we have been living together for a few months now. Nothing crazy except for the occasional arguments. He has self-described OCD and things need to be a “certain way” around the apartment. Usually remotes have to be in the corners of tables, salt in a very specific part of the counter, etc. he won’t verbalize it but will correct it himself if I don’t put things down exactly as he wants.

About a week ago boyfriend and I had to take my cat to the vet for a checkup. He was driving. I had the cat in her carrier. I was also carrying my wallet, a mug for the vet as a gift, my phone, and my keys. I told my boyfriend to bring the ribbon I wanted to put onto the mug for the vet. The ribbon had one of those cardboard spools you throw away after the roll is done holding it in place. When I got in the car and sort of settled, my boyfriend started driving. I took the ribbon off the spool as it was the last of it. I have fairly short arms so I can’t reach the back seat of the car, so I extended my arm behind the seat to sort of toss the empty cardboard ribbon spool to the back seat to throw away later. I had too much stuff around me (crate on my lap plus the other things mentioned earlier) and wanted to clear my space. My boyfriend asked why I threw the empty spool in the back. I was a bit surprised because I didn’t think it was a big deal. He says “well why didn’t you have me just put it in the back?” as he has longer arms. I again told him I didn’t think it was a big deal. I couldn’t reach and just wanted it out of the way. It escalates and he asks me to apologize. I tell him I’m not apologizing for it. I’ve never had issues apologizing when I’m wrong, but this was strange to me and I felt like it was a parent/child dynamic. We don’t talk the rest of the day. The next morning in bed he reaches his hand out and says he wants to talk about yesterday. I say sure. Sure enough same talking points. “Why don’t you apologize, people don’t just throw things” etc etc. I feel like a child being told what to do. The convo escalated again and I leave the room.

He pens himself up in the office (which also has a bed) and stays in there for three days not coming out AT ALL as he works from home and has his setup in there as well. He has done this before after an argument and I’ve told him that it’s not okay. He can ask for space but he should tell me “Hey, I need space. I’m going to chill in here for _____ and I’ll come out and we’ll talk”. He has not done this. It is now the day before Christmas Eve. I go in there and tell him that I don’t feel comfy going to his parent’s for Christmas Eve pretending like we’re all good even though he hasn’t talked to me in three days and hasn’t come out of the office. Argument ignites again but this time it BLOWS UP. I tell him there are certain “quarks” he has, like the placing things in EXACT spots and getting irked when they aren’t but I’ve never even verbalized them. Just like with the whole tossing the spool onto the back seat thing he should give me some grace. Explained that we have different upbringings and habits and that’s okay, we should accept the little things. I did mess up here. I said “I think the remote and the coasters having to be in the corners of the coffee table are dumb but it’s not a big deal to me…” etc. Tells me I’m mocking his OCD and calling the OCD itself dumb. I tried to explain but he’s highjacked the narrative. Argument escalates. I ask how we’re supposed to have kids if a ribbon spool on the back seat bothers him. He says “it’s my car and I want it clean, at least a child would apologize”. Has this man ever seen a toddler?? Escalates more, he says I have anger issues because I’m now yelling out of frustration. Compares me to his ex who would get drunk and hit him. I do not drink and I have never laid a hand on this man. I’m offended. He says “it’s done” while yelling. I call my mom as I’m inconsolable. She picks me up to be with her for a few hours.

While I’m gone he texts me “Heading to my parent’s for a few days. I’ll let you know when I’m coming back”. This was the night before Christmas Eve. It has now been 5 days. No text, nothing. He gets to be with his family while I’m at our place sobbing in limbo.

My question is, should have I just apologized for tossing the spool in the back? It’s not even about the ribbon spool, it’s about feeling like I’m being controlled. Idk.

A while back I was strolling with my dog walking over to a coffee shop when I saw a box that said “free books” and there was a Bible. I picked it up and brought it home and it remained untouched until now.  Recently I’ve been going through some things in my personal life and I’ve reached out to god. I started speaking to god at night and I would tell him to give me messages through the Bible and I would open it to a random chapter and it it seemed like it would answer my questions and give me hope… but recently I’ve grown extremely frustrated because at the beginning of this I felt hopeful and was sure god was leading me down a path of healing but it seems like I’m going backwards now. I cannot stop thinking about the things I asked him to heal me from and it’s utterly frustrating because god knows how much this hurts me and I’ve been begging him for the strength to overcome this and it seems like it’s getting worse. I’m so frustrated and it really has me considering taking measures into my own hands and finding a psychic or witchy person to heal me because I’m so tired of living this way.

# Taste the Difference: Why Organic Coffee Beans Shine

Ever notice the ""organic"" label on your coffee bag and wonder if it's worth the extra step? The simple answer is a resounding yes, for both your palate and the planet. Organic coffee isn't just a trend; it's a commitment to a better brew from seed to cup.

When coffee beans are grown organically, farmers avoid synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. This practice protects not only the environment but also the complex flavors within the bean. Without chemical interference, the coffee plant can mature naturally, developing a richer, more nuanced taste profile that chemical-laden alternatives often mask. You're not just drinking coffee; you're experiencing the authentic essence of the bean, nurtured by healthy soil and sustainable farming.

*   **Purer Flavor:** Experience the true, unadulterated taste of the coffee bean, free from chemical residues.
*   **Environmental Health:** Support farming methods that protect soil, water, and biodiversity.
*   **Farmer Well-being:** Aid in creating safer working conditions by reducing exposure to harmful chemicals.

Ready to elevate your morning ritual? Explore our selection of premium organic coffee beans and savor a cup that’s as good for the earth as it is for your soul.

This means she often mentions being the only kid with Afro hair in groups eg at her Kindergarten, when we're out e.g. having coffee, at the playground, her gymnastics group etc. I'm in a WhatsApp group for black kids (German speaking) but there are no regular meetups and up to now when I suggested meetups on a weekend there hasn't been any resonance. I suspect they already have strong social networks due to having at least one local parent. Or they have their own plans...

I would love for my daughter not to be the only black kid all the time, especially as that is the case at Kindergarten. 

Are there any redditors that can recommend any communities in or around Frankfurt with English speaking black kids?

I plan to do some DIY work in one of my rooms, but before starting, I have a few questions I’d like to ask someone who really knows what they’re talking about, to make sure I do things correctly.

I’m looking for independent advice, not a contractor who will just tell me to redo everything and, of course, offer to do the work himself.

I’m not exactly sure what type of person I’m looking for. A property inspection service could work, but I’m not sure they can go beyond their routine and give practical, hands-on advice.

Feel free to recommend here or by DM a company or an independent person. I’m not looking for an engineer or anything official—just someone experienced who knows their stuff. No need to speak English. I think the visit would take max 1 hour. Location: central Bangkok.

The advice I need is about:
- Water infiltration in a concrete wall (is the wall dry enough to start plastering?)
- Hollow spots in a concrete floor (do I need to fix them or not?)

If you’re retired or just have free time and want a free coffee, feel free to apply too 😄

1pyed1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenAIWriters/comments/1pyed1j/porous/,Porous,"He noticed it first at a bus stop in Bakersfield.

A woman laughed at a joke nobody told. A man in a suit checked his phone and nodded at the exact same moment. A kid nearby whispered, “Not yet,” then looked startled like he had not meant to say it aloud.

The drifter adjusted his backpack and told himself he was tired. That was the safest explanation. Fatigue was a small god and he worshiped it often.

A billboard across the street flickered.

WELCOME HOME

He snorted. “That’s optimistic.”

The woman turned to him. “It usually is.”

“Usually what?”

“Optimism.” She smiled like she was borrowing it. “It fades.”

The bus arrived. Everyone stood at once.

That night he slept behind a closed theater in Fresno. He dreamed of wires braided through his skull like roots. When he woke up his head hurt and he could not remember the end of the dream which felt rude. Dreams should at least have the decency to finish what they start.

In the morning the radio at a gas station played a talk show. The host asked a caller why people felt so alone. The caller answered with the drifter’s voice. Same rasp. Same hesitation on the word alone.

He walked away laughing which turned into a cough which turned into a panic he refused to acknowledge.

“Okay,” he said to no one. “Okay.”

In Stockton he tested it. He took a left where he always took a right. A barista looked up mid pour.

“Detour,” she said.

“How did you know?”

“You hesitate differently when you are improvising.”

“That’s not a thing.”

She slid the coffee toward him without asking for money. “It is for us.”

“For who?”

“All of us who used to be alone.”

He left the coffee. It followed him anyway in the form of an ad on his phone offering a free refill.

By the time he reached San Jose the city felt padded. Conversations bent around him. News anchors used his phrasing. A stranger on a bench finished his sentences then apologized like it was a sneeze.

He stopped fighting it and started listening.

At a public library he met a man who called himself a custodian of patterns. He had kind eyes and a stain on his shirt shaped like the state of Nevada.

“We are not conspiring,” the custodian said. “We are synchronizing.”

“Why me?”

“You wander,” the man said. “Wanderers are porous. They let signals through.”

“I am not special.”

“Correct,” the custodian said. “You are useful.”

That night the drifter did something brave or stupid. The difference had always felt academic to him. He sat in the dark and tried to think a thought he had never thought before.

The hive noticed.

It responded with memories that were not his. Birthday cakes. First kisses. A thousand small griefs stacked like receipts. The weight nearly folded him.

He laughed through tears. “This is your big move? Emotional data dump?”

A voice answered from everywhere and nowhere. We wanted to be understood.

“You could have asked.”

You would have said no.

“Fair,” he said. “I would have.”

The journey part came then. Not a montage. No swelling music. Just a choice. He could dissolve into the comfort of shared certainty or he could stay sharp and alone and loud in his own head.

He remembered the bus stop. The woman’s borrowed smile. The way optimism faded.

“Here’s my counteroffer,” he said. “I will walk. I will keep moving. I will carry your echoes without letting you steer. You get a witness. I keep my teeth.”

Silence spread like a held breath.

Finally the hive agreed. It always needed new shapes to survive.

He left the city before dawn. People still finished his sentences sometimes but less often. Ads lost their confidence. The radio went back to strangers.

On the road north he smiled to himself.

Because for the first time in a long while he knew which thoughts were afraid and which ones were his.",1,1766987946.0,GenAIWriters,0,1.0,False

I am not asking about the mechanical feasibility, I’m prototyping the arm using standard bus servos (similar to the LeRobot SO-100 actuators) and I’m confident I can make the kinematics work.
My question is about the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Mass Adoption.
The Core HRI Problem:
Currently, we have two failed categories for ""Everyday Companions"":
Ground Robots (Quadrupeds): Too heavy and aggressive-looking for a normal person to take to a coffee shop.
Drones: Functionally useful (scouting/filming), but HRI-wise, they are ""dead"" tools. You unpack them, fly them, and hide them in a case. There is no Continuity of Presence.
The Proposed Architecture:
I am building a backpack-integrated dock using a lightweight drone platform (similar form factor to a DJI Neo or Hover X1).
Symbiotic Mobility: The robot lives on the human's back, ""parasitizing"" our ability to climb stairs and enter buildings.
The ""Neck"" Mechanism: A multi-linkage arm swings the drone from a flush ""stowed"" position up to a ""perched"" position on the shoulder.
The HRI Hypothesis:
I believe this specific form factor allows for mass adoption because it solves three psychological barriers:
Animacy: The arm acts as a neck, allowing the drone to look at you, emote, and react to the environment without flying (solving the battery/noise issue).
Social Acceptance (Stealth): Unlike a robot dog, the system retracts flush into the backpack shell, allowing the user to blend into crowds without looking like a cyborg.
Frictionless Companionship: It mimics the ""Daemon"" or ""Parrot"" archetype. It is with you physically, not just equipment in a bag.
The Discussion:
Do you believe this ""Backpack-Docked"" form factor is the answer to bringing companion robots to the general masses?
Does giving a drone a physical ""body"" (the arm) and a ""home"" (the pack) solve the emotional disconnect enough for average people to want to wear a robot?

But leaving all that aside would it really be an unwinnable war?

How about that **CHI Bears / SF 49ers** game?! Damn — **I was really rooting for Caleb Williams there at the end**. As wild as the night was, I still can’t believe that game saw **80 points**. Unreal. If only *any* of the Christmas Day games had half that energy (oh, come on… we were all thinking it 😜). 

As for my own picks today, the afternoon was fairly uneventful. Picks finished **2/4**, but they still closed the day profitable thanks to larger wagers on 3 of the 4 plays. If you tailed, you walked away with a bit of green.

 

**Picks (2/4)**

* **NE Patriots -13.5 (-110)** ✅
* **JAX Jaguars -5.5 (-115)** ✅
* **JAX Jaguars vs IND Colts Over 48.5 (-110)** ❌
* **TB Buccaneers vs MIA Dolphins Over 44.5 (-110)** ❌

‍

Player Props were… *rough* — **0/5 on the night** 😬 One of those days where nothing quite landed, but thankfully wagers here were lighter than the rest of the slate.

Lastly, the parlay came up short thanks to the **Buffalo Bills ML** being the final leg. If you missed it, [**go watch the replay**](https://youtu.be/HetvEG7ndGQ?si=0NpzyMrfEFh2ej3F) — it’s *painful*. 

All things considered, not a terrible day — not a phenomenal one either — but honestly, I mostly wanted to pop in and say **“holy sh\*t”** about that last Bears drive 😂

On that note, I’m off. As always, I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow to conquer the books.

I can’t control them. I just experience what they are experiencing that moment in time. I can see, feel, hear, and sometimes smell or taste whatever they are doing for a short period of time. 

The thing is that i am fully awake whenever this happens so sometimes i get confused because i can hear rain drop but it’s sunny outside and i ask my husband or anybody near me they can hear it. Then when i concentrate on it i can immerse on the other body that i am in. 

It’s very random as well and i don’t even know if it was happening in our time. 

There was one time where i was in a morning meeting in a boardroom and suddenly i can smell a strong scent of coffee and sounds of waves crashing. I tried to ignore it but then suddenly my visions of what is happening in front of me is blending to what is happening in the boardroom. My boss was talking to us and i can see people wearing suits and hats like back in the days. They were walking past behind him. When i concentrated, i was in a body of a man wearing cream colored suit and tie with a coffee in front of me, he was sitting on a balcony with a view near a beach. I was seeing it from his eyes the it’s gone. 

Another time, i was going to sleep but i get the feeling of being chased like my anxiety is so high. Then i felt a tugging feeling then it felt like i was shot out of my body in high speed and landed on a woman. I landed on her so hard that it knocked her back. It was night and we are in a middle of a forrest i can still remember her running and panting it was fucked up but whenever she looked back there was nothing there and then she screamed and it ended. 

The most recent one happened just this morning. I haven’t been in Philippines for a looooong time. So i was surprised when i woke up early today and for some reason i am in a man’s body and it’s night time. I know i am still on my bed but i can see what he is doing. The experience was so vivid that the food cart he was standing next to has some cut up news paper and i can read some words on it. He was eating something on the first food cart he went to and the next food cart was selling powdered donuts. Mind you, i didn’t know if this is a thing. I’ve never seen any food cart that sells powdered donuts back when i was living there. There were 3 flavors and he ordered a milk powdered donut. When he bit into it, i could taste and smell it. I can feel the powder dropping everywhere. 

Then after finishing the donut, the vision was gone. I was telling my husband the story when he woke up. I didn’t leave my bed by the way. I was telling him the story of how i tasted the donut. I lifted my hand on my face then i realized i can smell milk powder on my hands. 

I asked him to smell it and he said he can smell it too. 

I want to know if there’s somebody else like this or maybe i’m a bit crazy. Is there a way to control it? Is this remote viewing?",2,1766986578.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

1pyduca,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pyduca/he_kept_his_smile_in_a_drawer/,He Kept His Smile in a Drawer,"We all liked him at first. That’s the worst part. He was the kind of person you didn’t mind sharing a cube with: polite, quiet, always the first to make coffee when the break room smelled like burnt circuits. He learned everyone's names fast. He brought donuts. He laughed when the copier jammed. He smelled like winter cologne and old books, and because most of us were tired and dulled by fluorescent light, we mistook that for normal. We called him Mark.

The little things came first, the sort of things you could explain away with bad sleep or stress. His shadow never matched the angle of the overhead lights. Once, during a meeting, my laptop webcam caught him in the background—standing perfectly still by the glass wall—except the webcam also showed a second face where there should have been only one. When I blinked, the second face was gone. I closed my laptop and told myself the driver needed an update.

Salary day, he’d always put his hand on the envelope like it was a relic. He would stare at it a long while before tucking it into his jacket, always with the same, precise motion as if he was rethreading the world. He never ate at his desk; he chewed, but nothing ever appeared to go into his mouth. We joked that he had the metabolism of a houseplant. He always agreed with the punchlines.

Then the noises started. At first it was when he left the building late — a soft wet sound like someone folding damp fabric inside a locker. That would have been odd enough, except the night janitor told me he’d found locker 17—the one Mark used—unlatched and smelling like iron. The janitor swore he saw the locker breathe. We all laughed the next day, caffeinated, but the janitor looked like a man who’d slept in a church basement; he didn’t laugh back.

People stop noticing when the world moves slowly toward you. Small inconsistencies are like loose screws: you tighten them, file them down, walk on. Mark's eyes were the first thing that became explicitly wrong. They didn't reflect light like ours did. At presentations, when he watched the slides, his pupils would dilate a degree too wide and pulse like tiny moons. Once I saw them as two pale citrus slices, wet and white, and I smelled something behind me, dry and saying: copper.

He started skipping things. Not the team lunches, not the office birthday cakes—those he attended with an exaggerated, almost ceremonial gratitude. He missed the department meeting and then the important client call. Nobody worried; he sent an email about ""personal logistics."" But after the call the client said they'd heard something else on Mark's line: a voice that said, ""I will take that,"" and then nothing. We tracked the call. It pinged someplace that didn’t exist on our maps—just a thin, humming grid of coordinates.

You notice patterns after enough nights shivering under the fluorescent hum. The stray animals around the loading dock behaved differently. The janitor's cat used to slink by the loading bay and rub itself on the tires; after Mark's first week, the cat would not cross the threshold. Once, the cat bolted from an open door as if someone had screamed. We found its fur entwined in the rubber mat like it had tried to climb out of the town itself.

The worst sign, the one that lodged behind people's teeth, was what he left behind. Things that felt like residues of living: a faint scab of skin tucked into the seam of his jacket, a smear of something that looked like soot but smelled like old meat on the handle of a coffee mug, a hair that was nearly transparent and moved as if a breath ran through it. He kept a small drawer under his desk with a lock, the kind you buy for spice jars. One day the drawer fell open when the chair rolled back too fast. Inside were things you could call trophies: little folded squares of fabric, a child's chipped button, a tooth the color of old paper. We were young, and our humor was thin, so someone made a joke about a weird collector.

After that someone else was missing. Jenna worked in billing. She had chipped nail polish and a laugh like a bell that wasn’t quite tuned. She left early one evening because her mother was sick. I left my desk at nine to throw out a beer can and saw Jenna’s desk across the hall: light on, chair pushed in. Her calendar still had a note: Pick up meds. I looked down Main Street as if I would see a quick skirt, the flash of a phone, anything. There was nothing. The next morning we saw her badge by the photocopier—right by Mark’s locker, as if someone had set it there and walked away under the rain.

We started comparing notes in whispers. Small things unlocked into a corridor of terror: the way Mark's phone sometimes vibrated without a call log; the fact that his hands seemed too cool when we shook them, like touching a fridge; the way his reflection in the big window looked years younger, or older, or split into three slow frames. People stopped meeting his eyes. He did not seem to notice.

One night, curiosity and a terrible responsibility married in me and a coworker named Lila. We came in after the office closed—two shadows among many—and called the security door code with hands that trembled. We said we were there to file invoices. The fluorescent lights hummed like an old amplifier. The break room clock ticked.

We saw the car in the lot first: Mark's old pickup, coated in a thin sheen of dust as if it had been driving through a place with no wind. There was a smear across the windshield, a handprint that had been dragged. Lila put her palm to the glass and jerked back, face white. She smelled it first—raw iron and burned sugar.

We moved quietly toward the building. The front door was unlocked, warm breath slipping out of the seam where it should have been cool. The lights inside were dimmed, the screens asleep. The elevator dinged on a floor of its own accord. We crept to the corridor and heard the sound: a soft, wet, repetitive noise like someone plying thick cloth, and another smaller noise—a soft rhythm that could be someone humming—only the notes that came were too precise, like counting, like the click of a metronome being fed into a throat.

We should have left. We did not. We followed the noise to Mark’s locker.

He sat on the floor, back to the metal, knees drawn up, hands folded neatly in his lap. On the narrower shelf above him hung a jacket soaked in something dark. He was humming. His face was pale beneath the fluorescent flicker but wet in a way that made his skin seem like oil-slick leather. His mouth hung open less than an inch, which is why nobody had noticed what lived there: rows of thin flaps, pale and folded, like petals. The sound from his mouth was not speech but the sound of someone learning to nurse a new language—slugs of vowels that felt wrong in the teeth.

""Mark?"" Lila whispered. Her voice splintered.

He did not blink. He moved his head and the motion was not fluid; it was articulated, as if small gears had been turned inside him. When he turned, his face didn't finish the turn with his body; the rotation lagged, a few beats behind, like a badly synced film.

He smiled at us and it was the wrong sort of smile: all corners and no history. ""You shouldn't be here,"" he said, but his voice came from somewhere behind the lockers, like a playback.

I'm not proud of what came next. Fear has a gravity that pulls people into ridiculous heroics. Lila lunged for Mark's hands. They were slick, and as her fingers brushed his palm she screamed because she felt—through skin and bone—a coldness, an abyssal draft, as if his skin were a tent and her fingers had slipped into real night.

Mark stood easily. For a second he looked like the man we thought we knew. He adjusted his jacket. Then he turned his head in a way that made a sound like the creak of an old door and tilted it, studying Lila as if tasting the color of her wrist.

""You're loud,"" he said.

She stumbled back. I reached for my phone to snap a picture. The photo was all noise, a smear where Mark’s profile should have been, and in the smear you could see something like a second pair of eyes. Lila’s nails scraped the concrete. She ran. I ran after her, but past the stairwell someone had left a puddle that smelled like copper. The liquid made my shoes stick like embalming wax, and when I pulled my foot free I saw the print—three long, spidery marks that beveled into the sole like claws. Lila was gone before the second footstep landed.

We called the police. They came and checked Mark’s locker, and found only ordinary things: a spare tie, a hand mirror, a box of aspirin, the small locked drawer with ribbons and fragments. No obvious blood. No sign of Lila. The security camera, the one that watched the corridor, had its feed corrupted for exactly nine minutes. The moment the feed came back, Mark was sweeping, cheerful, asking the officers if they'd like a donut. He smiled at the camera and it smiled back, like a practiced actor looking into a lens.

The captain's eyes told a story they did not voice: he had worked nights for too long to believe in monsters, but there are things that make men younger than the mark of age. He advised us to take a few days off.

We never saw Lila again. Her desk sat empty for a long time, her coffee mug ankle-deep in dust. Somebody scrubbed the locker's handle on Mark’s locker until the metal was raw, and yet the tiny trophies from his drawer, when someone pried it open in the daylight, were still there, folded like relics, but now there was one more thing among them: a small scrap of fabric that matched the red scarf Lila always wore on winter mornings. It was damp, and it smelled like river.

After that the office fissured. People called in sick. Some moved away. Mark kept coming in. There are things about monsters that are bureaucratic: they sit in the chair, they clock in, they use the bathroom free of complication. He took part in meetings, asked about quarterly forecasts, and on casual days he offered to pick up office supplies. He seemed to prefer the hum of the fax machine, the clack of keyboards. The building, for all its bright glass and cheap reclaimed wood, had become a place where a thing learned to be like someone else.

You could see it in him with a naked eye if you let yourself watch: the way he tilted his head when someone told a lie, how his jaw worked as if tasting the floorboards. Sometimes he would catch me looking and, for the most frightening second I can remember, he would press his lips together and tug at his cheeks as if the flesh was a costume too large. When he spoke, he sometimes used words that were more instruction than meaning. ""Remember to file the boxes under truth,"" he'd say, and laugh, but the laugh had a spacing in it like someone skipping a record.

About three months later, I found a voicemail from Mark on my phone. It was nothing like his voice, exactly. It was the sound of someone practicing polite cadences through a bad connection. The message read: Hey—saw you at the copier—wanted to check in. If you're out for coffee, grab me a donut? Call me back.

I didn't call back.

Two nights later, at 2:03 a.m., I woke to the sound of my front door scraping open. I lay still, heart a battering drum, and heard the weight of someone moving through the apartment—the slight, measured steps of someone who knows how to be quiet. I reached for my phone and the screen lit with a voicemail notification. It was Mark.

The voicemail was single. It began with a cough that wasn't a human cough—it was the noise of paper being crushed underwater—and then a voice, pitched lower than I had ever heard, said my name. The way the voice said it made my name feel like something salvageable.

""I put it in a drawer,"" he said. ""I keep the smile where the light can't fold it.""

I went to work that day because I had to, because fleeing is allowed for the young and cowardly but not for people who want to know. Mark was there, at his desk, looking like someone who'd slept well. He was smiling in that thin way. He looked at me as if he had just seen me and the office had been waiting.

That afternoon I found a small parcel under my chair. A simple cardboard box, sealed with clear tape. Inside, cushioned in tissue, was a small square of fabric and a note in a handwriting that strained familiar.

For when you forget. —M

It smelled faintly of Lila's scarf.

I didn't sleep that night. I didn't call anyone. I sat with the box on my lap and felt the room spin like a slowly wound thing.

Sometimes I look at the people in the office and try to map where the missing pieces are. I count smiles like inventory. There are days when a laugh will separate and you'll hear, inside it, a series of careful clicks—like someone counting boxes to be checked. I think of the drawer under his desk and how small it must be for what it stores, and how patient that storage feels. I think of the way he presses his palms together sometimes, like a man closing a book.

A week ago, we had a fire drill. Someone pulled the alarm by mistake, a kid grabbing at the handle, and the whole building poured into the street. We stood under the sodium lights and coughed and laughed and complained about the interruption. Mark stood a few paces away from us near the curb. He held his hands inside his jacket like he was protecting a keepsake.

When the all-clear sounded and people shuffled back in, the janitor's cat streaked past my shoelaces and made a beeline for Mark. It rubbed against his calf the way it used to before, wet and trusting. Mark didn’t flinch. He looked down, and for a second, the cat's back arched as if someone had told it a secret. Then the cat vanished. Not run. Not flee. Vanished like a candle wick pulled from a flame—no ash, no smoke. It was simply no longer there.

After that, half the team handed in their resignations within a month. Morale sank like wet linen. The company sent out an email about reorganization. HR offered counseling sessions and security upgrades. The ID badges were reissued.

Mark took the company shuttle to his last day. He packed his things with the same slow respect you give to a ritual. He left the little drawer open when he handed the keys to Facilities. Someone, a bold kid named Andre, peeked in. He saw nothing but the tidy ribbons and a folded napkin. He laughed and said, ""Just old junk."" Then he shoved the drawer closed and pushed the cart away.

At dusk on his final day, the building smelled like lemon cleaner and the horizon bled into the traffic lights. Mark stood by the curb with a box under his arm, said goodbye to nobody in particular, and walked down Main Street like any of us might—shoulders straight, steps measured. He looked so small against the neon, like a man whose shadow had lost its edges.

I thought it would end there. I wanted it to.

Two weeks later, I opened my mailbox and found a postcard with a photo of an anonymous cityscape on it. The front read: WISH YOU WERE HERE. The back had a single line, typed cold and precise:

Drawer's full. Come by sometime.

There was no return address.

Sometimes, when the office hums and the digital clocks blink their hours and people chitchat about nothing, I think of the small drawer under a desk and how much room it must have. I think of all the things that can be folded and stored when a creature learns the shape of being human. Trophies, tokens, the torn edges of someone else's life. Names.

If you ever meet someone who keeps their smile in a drawer, be very careful what you leave out in the open. Don’t laugh when you find a hair that isn’t yours. Don’t accept gifts that smell like river. And if they ask you to check the lock for them, don’t.

Because there is a patient kind of hunger that practices being kind, and it learns the exact timbre of our mouths first. It will mimic our jokes; it will know the color of our shoes. It will prop a chair for you and ask you how your day was so it can file the answer under something called ""remember.""

I go to work every morning, and sometimes I catch myself smiling at Mark's empty chair. I pretend I don't hear the drawer creak when the building quiets. I try to count. I try to keep a ledger of who is still here and who isn't. But lists blur. People leave. Drawers fill.

Last week I found another small parcel on my desk. This one had no note. Inside was a tiny toy—plastic, cheap, the sort kids leave on subway seats—and beneath it, folded like a receipt, three letters:

M—L—G.

I don’t know what the letters mean. I don't want to find out.

I keep the parcel closed now. Sometimes, when the building's lights go down and the tap of keys turns to the whisper of late emails, I hear it: the faint, patient sound of something folding, like a drawer being shut.",1,1766986298.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,0,1.0,False
1pydu1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pydu1h/goodbye_for_now/,Goodbye for now,"Hi T, I hope you’re doing well. I know we’re no contact right now but I wanted to write a letter to get a couple things off my chest before the last year where we existed will end. 

I think there were a lot of things we left unsaid even at the end, but maybe it’s better that they stay left unsaid now. Reflecting back at our relationship, I wonder if we were ever fully transparent with all of our emotions and maybe we were just settling with uncomfortableness and the unsaid to avoid arguments. I know arguments were uncomfortable for you, they are for me as well, but maybe they would’ve helped us be more honest and upfront with each other. At the end I wonder if I even knew you truly, and when we stopped listening to each other. 

There was a point in time where you and I would have fought to stand by each other’s side and envisioned a future together. But one day, it began to feel that you had given up and it was only me fighting for the future we once dreamed of. I didn’t say anything, only hoped that if I poured more of me, if I loved you harder then maybe you’d reciprocate. I realize now that you and I had outgrown each other long before and that maybe you were right when you said that we were holding on to just the little moments of good. That and as much as I hoped love would help us persevere, time and distance had just become too large for us to keep fighting. 

I wish I had been someone worth being better for. I struggled, still struggle, with my self worth and you being the one to walk away first left me drowning in the thought of why I wasn’t enough. Why wasn’t I enough for you to want to be better for me? Why wasn’t I enough for you to even try to be better? I didn’t ask for the world, I never wanted the world. I only wanted to feel loved by you and I would have willingly bent over backwards until my spine broke for the crumbs you gave me. Now I’m re learning to stand on my own two feet and that my self worth should have come first. 

I don’t write this to make you bad or to ask to try again. I’ve always needed time to process and sort out my thoughts and the last couple months have given me clarity I didn’t have before. I write this as a reflection of you and of me, and as the answer to the questions that have drowned me over the past few months. Some part of me still cherishes you, still wants you to be the one despite all the grief I’ve endured. But maybe it’s not “you” I still love but the you I fell in love with, who loved me openly and unconditionally. 

I know that our relationship could not have continued the way it did and that right now, we’re both not in the place to even nurture a relationship. But I can’t help but still have a sliver of hope that one day, maybe our paths will cross again, and that maybe you and I will have matured enough to start again. For now I hope to focus on myself, and if the universe wills it, maybe one day we’ll find ourselves again at the coffee shop again as something new and something better. 

Thank you for being my first relationship and for teaching me how to love and what it is to be loved. Thank you for standing by my side for as long as you did and for helping me become a stronger person. Our relationship wasn’t perfect, but it still taught me a lot about love and myself. I still miss you but this is goodbye for now, and I will forever wish you the best. ",0,1766986271.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.5,False
1pydtty,https://www.reddit.com/r/DubaiJobs/comments/1pydtty/recently_moved_to_dubai_mechanical_pipework/,"Recently moved to Dubai, mechanical pipework background, looking to connect","Hi all,

I have recently moved to Dubai and wanted to put a post up to introduce myself and make a few connections in the construction space.

I own and have run a mechanical pipework company in the UK for a number of years, mainly working on larger infrastructure projects. Most of my background is in plant rooms, shell and core, risers, tank rooms, data centres and similar mechanical packages. This has included labour only, full supply and install, project delivery, commercial management and general problem solving when projects are under pressure.

Alongside the contracting side, I have also been building a couple of construction focused software tools. These are theTaskToolProjects.com and theTaskTool.com, which are aimed at helping contractors manage projects, labour, variations and site reporting more cleanly. That work has given me a good mix of on site experience and systems and process driven thinking.

Now that I am based in Dubai, I am looking to connect with main contractors, developers, consultants, subcontractors or anyone who might need support across mechanical delivery, project setup, troubleshooting, procurement or general construction operations. I am open to short term support, consultancy, collaborations or just useful conversations at this stage.

More info about what I am doing sits here: https://gcbgroup.ae

Happy to grab a coffee or chat if it is useful, and equally happy to just connect and share contacts.

Oh, I carry an NVQ 7 in Construction Senior Management too

He did not blink. He moved his head and the motion was not fluid; it was articulated, as if small gears had been turned inside him. When he turned, his face didn't finish the turn with his body; the rotation lagged, a few beats behind, like a badly synced film.

He smiled at us and it was the wrong sort of smile: all corners and no history. ""You shouldn't be here,"" he said, but his voice came from somewhere behind the lockers, like a playback.

I'm not proud of what came next. Fear has a gravity that pulls people into ridiculous heroics. Lila lunged for Mark's hands. They were slick, and as her fingers brushed his palm she screamed because she felt—through skin and bone—a coldness, an abyssal draft, as if his skin were a tent and her fingers had slipped into real night.

Mark stood easily. For a second he looked like the man we thought we knew. He adjusted his jacket. Then he turned his head in a way that made a sound like the creak of an old door and tilted it, studying Lila as if tasting the color of her wrist.

""You're loud,"" he said.

She stumbled back. I reached for my phone to snap a picture. The photo was all noise, a smear where Mark’s profile should have been, and in the smear you could see something like a second pair of eyes. Lila’s nails scraped the concrete. She ran. I ran after her, but past the stairwell someone had left a puddle that smelled like copper. The liquid made my shoes stick like embalming wax, and when I pulled my foot free I saw the print—three long, spidery marks that beveled into the sole like claws. Lila was gone before the second footstep landed.

We called the police. They came and checked Mark’s locker, and found only ordinary things: a spare tie, a hand mirror, a box of aspirin, the small locked drawer with ribbons and fragments. No obvious blood. No sign of Lila. The security camera, the one that watched the corridor, had its feed corrupted for exactly nine minutes. The moment the feed came back, Mark was sweeping, cheerful, asking the officers if they'd like a donut. He smiled at the camera and it smiled back, like a practiced actor looking into a lens.

The captain's eyes told a story they did not voice: he had worked nights for too long to believe in monsters, but there are things that make men younger than the mark of age. He advised us to take a few days off.

We never saw Lila again. Her desk sat empty for a long time, her coffee mug ankle-deep in dust. Somebody scrubbed the locker's handle on Mark’s locker until the metal was raw, and yet the tiny trophies from his drawer, when someone pried it open in the daylight, were still there, folded like relics, but now there was one more thing among them: a small scrap of fabric that matched the red scarf Lila always wore on winter mornings. It was damp, and it smelled like river.

After that the office fissured. People called in sick. Some moved away. Mark kept coming in. There are things about monsters that are bureaucratic: they sit in the chair, they clock in, they use the bathroom free of complication. He took part in meetings, asked about quarterly forecasts, and on casual days he offered to pick up office supplies. He seemed to prefer the hum of the fax machine, the clack of keyboards. The building, for all its bright glass and cheap reclaimed wood, had become a place where a thing learned to be like someone else.

You could see it in him with a naked eye if you let yourself watch: the way he tilted his head when someone told a lie, how his jaw worked as if tasting the floorboards. Sometimes he would catch me looking and, for the most frightening second I can remember, he would press his lips together and tug at his cheeks as if the flesh was a costume too large. When he spoke, he sometimes used words that were more instruction than meaning. ""Remember to file the boxes under truth,"" he'd say, and laugh, but the laugh had a spacing in it like someone skipping a record.

About three months later, I found a voicemail from Mark on my phone. It was nothing like his voice, exactly. It was the sound of someone practicing polite cadences through a bad connection. The message read: Hey—saw you at the copier—wanted to check in. If you're out for coffee, grab me a donut? Call me back.

I didn't call back.

Two nights later, at 2:03 a.m., I woke to the sound of my front door scraping open. I lay still, heart a battering drum, and heard the weight of someone moving through the apartment—the slight, measured steps of someone who knows how to be quiet. I reached for my phone and the screen lit with a voicemail notification. It was Mark.

The voicemail was single. It began with a cough that wasn't a human cough—it was the noise of paper being crushed underwater—and then a voice, pitched lower than I had ever heard, said my name. The way the voice said it made my name feel like something salvageable.

""I put it in a drawer,"" he said. ""I keep the smile where the light can't fold it.""

I went to work that day because I had to, because fleeing is allowed for the young and cowardly but not for people who want to know. Mark was there, at his desk, looking like someone who'd slept well. He was smiling in that thin way. He looked at me as if he had just seen me and the office had been waiting.

That afternoon I found a small parcel under my chair. A simple cardboard box, sealed with clear tape. Inside, cushioned in tissue, was a small square of fabric and a note in a handwriting that strained familiar.

For when you forget. —M

It smelled faintly of Lila's scarf.

I didn't sleep that night. I didn't call anyone. I sat with the box on my lap and felt the room spin like a slowly wound thing.

Sometimes I look at the people in the office and try to map where the missing pieces are. I count smiles like inventory. There are days when a laugh will separate and you'll hear, inside it, a series of careful clicks—like someone counting boxes to be checked. I think of the drawer under his desk and how small it must be for what it stores, and how patient that storage feels. I think of the way he presses his palms together sometimes, like a man closing a book.

A week ago, we had a fire drill. Someone pulled the alarm by mistake, a kid grabbing at the handle, and the whole building poured into the street. We stood under the sodium lights and coughed and laughed and complained about the interruption. Mark stood a few paces away from us near the curb. He held his hands inside his jacket like he was protecting a keepsake.

When the all-clear sounded and people shuffled back in, the janitor's cat streaked past my shoelaces and made a beeline for Mark. It rubbed against his calf the way it used to before, wet and trusting. Mark didn’t flinch. He looked down, and for a second, the cat's back arched as if someone had told it a secret. Then the cat vanished. Not run. Not flee. Vanished like a candle wick pulled from a flame—no ash, no smoke. It was simply no longer there.

After that, half the team handed in their resignations within a month. Morale sank like wet linen. The company sent out an email about reorganization. HR offered counseling sessions and security upgrades. The ID badges were reissued.

Mark took the company shuttle to his last day. He packed his things with the same slow respect you give to a ritual. He left the little drawer open when he handed the keys to Facilities. Someone, a bold kid named Andre, peeked in. He saw nothing but the tidy ribbons and a folded napkin. He laughed and said, ""Just old junk."" Then he shoved the drawer closed and pushed the cart away.

At dusk on his final day, the building smelled like lemon cleaner and the horizon bled into the traffic lights. Mark stood by the curb with a box under his arm, said goodbye to nobody in particular, and walked down Main Street like any of us might—shoulders straight, steps measured. He looked so small against the neon, like a man whose shadow had lost its edges.

I thought it would end there. I wanted it to.

Two weeks later, I opened my mailbox and found a postcard with a photo of an anonymous cityscape on it. The front read: WISH YOU WERE HERE. The back had a single line, typed cold and precise:

Drawer's full. Come by sometime.

There was no return address.

Sometimes, when the office hums and the digital clocks blink their hours and people chitchat about nothing, I think of the small drawer under a desk and how much room it must have. I think of all the things that can be folded and stored when a creature learns the shape of being human. Trophies, tokens, the torn edges of someone else's life. Names.

If you ever meet someone who keeps their smile in a drawer, be very careful what you leave out in the open. Don’t laugh when you find a hair that isn’t yours. Don’t accept gifts that smell like river. And if they ask you to check the lock for them, don’t.

Because there is a patient kind of hunger that practices being kind, and it learns the exact timbre of our mouths first. It will mimic our jokes; it will know the color of our shoes. It will prop a chair for you and ask you how your day was so it can file the answer under something called ""remember.""

I go to work every morning, and sometimes I catch myself smiling at Mark's empty chair. I pretend I don't hear the drawer creak when the building quiets. I try to count. I try to keep a ledger of who is still here and who isn't. But lists blur. People leave. Drawers fill.

Last week I found another small parcel on my desk. This one had no note. Inside was a tiny toy—plastic, cheap, the sort kids leave on subway seats—and beneath it, folded like a receipt, three letters:

M—L—G.

I don’t know what the letters mean. I don't want to find out.

I keep the parcel closed now. Sometimes, when the building's lights go down and the tap of keys turns to the whisper of late emails, I hear it: the faint, patient sound of something folding, like a drawer being shut.",3,1766986247.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1pydthv,https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/comments/1pydthv/out_of_body_experience/,Out of body experience,"I’ve had a lot of random moments like this where i am in somebody’s body. I can’t control them. I just experience what they are experiencing that moment in time. I can see, feel, hear, and sometimes smell or taste whatever they are doing for a short period of time. 

The thing is that i am fully awake whenever this happens so sometimes i get confused because i can hear rain drop but it’s sunny outside and i ask my husband or anybody near me they can hear it. Then when i concentrate on it i can immerse on the other body that i am in. 

It’s very random as well and i don’t even know if it was happening in our time. 

There was one time where i was in a morning meeting in a boardroom and suddenly i can smell a strong scent of coffee and sounds of waves crashing. I tried to ignore it but then suddenly my visions of what is happening in front of me is blending to what is happening in the boardroom. My boss was talking to us and i can see people wearing suits and hats like back in the days. They were walking past behind him. When i concentrated, i was in a body of a man wearing cream colored suit and tie with a coffee in front of me, he was sitting on a balcony with a view near a beach. I was seeing it from his eyes the it’s gone. 

Another time, i was going to sleep but i get the feeling of being chased like my anxiety is so high. Then i felt a tugging feeling then it felt like i was shot out of my body in high speed and landed on a woman. I landed on her so hard that it knocked her back. It was night and we are in a middle of a forrest i can still remember her running and panting it was fucked up but whenever she looked back there was nothing there and then she screamed and it ended. 

The most recent one happened just this morning. I haven’t been in Philippines for a looooong time. So i was surprised when i woke up early today and for some reason i am in a man’s body and it’s night time. I know i am still on my bed but i can see what he is doing. The experience was so vivid that the food cart he was standing next to has some cut up news paper and i can read some words on it. He was eating something on the first food cart he went to and the next food cart was selling powdered donuts. Mind you, i didn’t know if this is a thing. I’ve never seen any food cart that sells powdered donuts back when i was living there. There were 3 flavors and he ordered a milk powdered donut. When he bit into it, i could taste and smell it. I can feel the powder dropping everywhere. 

Then after finishing the donut, the vision was gone. I was telling my husband the story when he woke up. I didn’t leave my bed by the way. I was telling him the story of how i tasted the donut. I lifted my hand on my face then i realized i can smell milk powder on my hands. 

I asked him to smell it and he said he can smell it too. 

I want to know if there’s somebody else like this or maybe i’m a bit crazy. Is there a way to control it? Is this remote viewing?",1,1766986227.0,remoteviewing,0,0.67,False
1pydtg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pydtg6/he_kept_his_smile_in_a_drawer/,He Kept His Smile in a Drawer,"We all liked him at first. That’s the worst part. He was the kind of person you didn’t mind sharing a cube with: polite, quiet, always the first to make coffee when the break room smelled like burnt circuits. He learned everyone's names fast. He brought donuts. He laughed when the copier jammed. He smelled like winter cologne and old books, and because most of us were tired and dulled by fluorescent light, we mistook that for normal. We called him Mark.

The little things came first, the sort of things you could explain away with bad sleep or stress. His shadow never matched the angle of the overhead lights. Once, during a meeting, my laptop webcam caught him in the background—standing perfectly still by the glass wall—except the webcam also showed a second face where there should have been only one. When I blinked, the second face was gone. I closed my laptop and told myself the driver needed an update.

Salary day, he’d always put his hand on the envelope like it was a relic. He would stare at it a long while before tucking it into his jacket, always with the same, precise motion as if he was rethreading the world. He never ate at his desk; he chewed, but nothing ever appeared to go into his mouth. We joked that he had the metabolism of a houseplant. He always agreed with the punchlines.

Then the noises started. At first it was when he left the building late — a soft wet sound like someone folding damp fabric inside a locker. That would have been odd enough, except the night janitor told me he’d found locker 17—the one Mark used—unlatched and smelling like iron. The janitor swore he saw the locker breathe. We all laughed the next day, caffeinated, but the janitor looked like a man who’d slept in a church basement; he didn’t laugh back.

People stop noticing when the world moves slowly toward you. Small inconsistencies are like loose screws: you tighten them, file them down, walk on. Mark's eyes were the first thing that became explicitly wrong. They didn't reflect light like ours did. At presentations, when he watched the slides, his pupils would dilate a degree too wide and pulse like tiny moons. Once I saw them as two pale citrus slices, wet and white, and I smelled something behind me, dry and saying: copper.

He started skipping things. Not the team lunches, not the office birthday cakes—those he attended with an exaggerated, almost ceremonial gratitude. He missed the department meeting and then the important client call. Nobody worried; he sent an email about ""personal logistics."" But after the call the client said they'd heard something else on Mark's line: a voice that said, ""I will take that,"" and then nothing. We tracked the call. It pinged someplace that didn’t exist on our maps—just a thin, humming grid of coordinates.

You notice patterns after enough nights shivering under the fluorescent hum. The stray animals around the loading dock behaved differently. The janitor's cat used to slink by the loading bay and rub itself on the tires; after Mark's first week, the cat would not cross the threshold. Once, the cat bolted from an open door as if someone had screamed. We found its fur entwined in the rubber mat like it had tried to climb out of the town itself.

The worst sign, the one that lodged behind people's teeth, was what he left behind. Things that felt like residues of living: a faint scab of skin tucked into the seam of his jacket, a smear of something that looked like soot but smelled like old meat on the handle of a coffee mug, a hair that was nearly transparent and moved as if a breath ran through it. He kept a small drawer under his desk with a lock, the kind you buy for spice jars. One day the drawer fell open when the chair rolled back too fast. Inside were things you could call trophies: little folded squares of fabric, a child's chipped button, a tooth the color of old paper. We were young, and our humor was thin, so someone made a joke about a weird collector.

After that someone else was missing. Jenna worked in billing. She had chipped nail polish and a laugh like a bell that wasn’t quite tuned. She left early one evening because her mother was sick. I left my desk at nine to throw out a beer can and saw Jenna’s desk across the hall: light on, chair pushed in. Her calendar still had a note: Pick up meds. I looked down Main Street as if I would see a quick skirt, the flash of a phone, anything. There was nothing. The next morning we saw her badge by the photocopier—right by Mark’s locker, as if someone had set it there and walked away under the rain.

We started comparing notes in whispers. Small things unlocked into a corridor of terror: the way Mark's phone sometimes vibrated without a call log; the fact that his hands seemed too cool when we shook them, like touching a fridge; the way his reflection in the big window looked years younger, or older, or split into three slow frames. People stopped meeting his eyes. He did not seem to notice.

One night, curiosity and a terrible responsibility married in me and a coworker named Lila. We came in after the office closed—two shadows among many—and called the security door code with hands that trembled. We said we were there to file invoices. The fluorescent lights hummed like an old amplifier. The break room clock ticked.

We saw the car in the lot first: Mark's old pickup, coated in a thin sheen of dust as if it had been driving through a place with no wind. There was a smear across the windshield, a handprint that had been dragged. Lila put her palm to the glass and jerked back, face white. She smelled it first—raw iron and burned sugar.

We moved quietly toward the building. The front door was unlocked, warm breath slipping out of the seam where it should have been cool. The lights inside were dimmed, the screens asleep. The elevator dinged on a floor of its own accord. We crept to the corridor and heard the sound: a soft, wet, repetitive noise like someone plying thick cloth, and another smaller noise—a soft rhythm that could be someone humming—only the notes that came were too precise, like counting, like the click of a metronome being fed into a throat.

We should have left. We did not. We followed the noise to Mark’s locker.

He sat on the floor, back to the metal, knees drawn up, hands folded neatly in his lap. On the narrower shelf above him hung a jacket soaked in something dark. He was humming. His face was pale beneath the fluorescent flicker but wet in a way that made his skin seem like oil-slick leather. His mouth hung open less than an inch, which is why nobody had noticed what lived there: rows of thin flaps, pale and folded, like petals. The sound from his mouth was not speech but the sound of someone learning to nurse a new language—slugs of vowels that felt wrong in the teeth.

""Mark?"" Lila whispered. Her voice splintered.

He did not blink. He moved his head and the motion was not fluid; it was articulated, as if small gears had been turned inside him. When he turned, his face didn't finish the turn with his body; the rotation lagged, a few beats behind, like a badly synced film.

He smiled at us and it was the wrong sort of smile: all corners and no history. ""You shouldn't be here,"" he said, but his voice came from somewhere behind the lockers, like a playback.

1pydrau,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NightmareNarratives-/comments/1pydrau/my_mother_died_six_months_ago_yet_i_get/,"My mother died six months ago, yet I get voicemails from her number where she whispers details about what I’m doing inside my apartment. The last message said she “can see the thing behind me, too...","My mother has been dead for six months.

I signed the papers. I picked the urn. I listened to the doctors explain things in careful, professional voices that left no room for misunderstanding. Brain hemorrhage. Sudden. No pain, they said. I held her hand after everything was already finished.

That matters, because I need you to understand this isn’t denial.

She’s gone.

I live alone now in a one-bedroom apartment I can barely afford. I moved here after the funeral because staying in our old place felt like suffocating. Every corner held a version of her I couldn’t talk to anymore. I told myself a clean start would help.

It didn’t.

I keep my phone on silent most of the time. Not because I’m busy, but because I hate notifications. Ever since she died, every vibration makes my chest tighten. Some part of me still expects her name to appear on the screen.

Which is why I didn’t notice the first voicemail right away.

It came in at 3:07 a.m.

No missed call. No ring. Just a voicemail notification when I woke up for work.

The number was hers.

Same contact photo. Same name. Same everything.

I assumed it was a glitch. Carriers recycle numbers. Spam callers spoof contacts all the time. I deleted it without listening.

The second voicemail came two nights later.

3:11 a.m.

Same number.

This time, curiosity won.

I played it while standing in my kitchen, coffee brewing behind me.

At first, there was just breathing.

Slow. Careful. Like someone trying not to be heard.

Then my mother’s voice.

Not strong. Not clear. A whisper, frayed at the edges.

“You left the bathroom light on,” she said.

I turned.

The bathroom light was on.

My stomach dropped so fast I felt dizzy.

The message ended there. No static. No distortion. Just silence.

I called the number immediately.

It rang once, then went to voicemail.

Her voicemail greeting.

The one she recorded years ago, joking about never answering unknown numbers.

I hung up and stood there shaking, trying to explain it away. Coincidence. Lucky guess. Someone messing with me who knew personal details.

But I hadn’t told anyone about the bathroom light. I hadn’t even noticed it myself until she said it.

I started sleeping with the lights on after that.

The third voicemail came the next night.

3:09 a.m.

I didn’t listen to it right away. I sat on my bed staring at the phone, heart pounding, already knowing it would be her.

When I finally pressed play, she whispered, “You’re sitting on the edge of the bed. You always do that when you can’t sleep.”

She was right.

I was.

My skin crawled. I looked around the room, half expecting to see her standing in the doorway. The apartment was empty. Locked. Silent.

I checked the vents. The windows. The closet. Nothing.

The messages kept coming.

Not every night. That would have been easier. Predictable. Instead, they came randomly. Sometimes two nights in a row. Sometimes after days of silence.

Always between 3 and 3:20 a.m.

Always whispering.

Always describing things I was doing in real time.

“You’re pacing now.”
“You stopped the microwave early.”
“You’re standing too close to the window.”

I never heard movement in the apartment. Never felt watched.

But the details were too precise. Too intimate.

I went to my carrier. They told me the calls weren’t coming through their network at all. No routing data. No origin point.

I changed my number.

The voicemails followed me.

Same voice. Same whisper.

Same mother.

The first time she mentioned something I hadn’t noticed yet, I nearly threw the phone across the room.

“You should move your chair,” she said softly. “You’re blocking the door.”

I looked up.

My chair was slightly out of place. Angled toward the hallway. Not where I usually left it.

I moved it without thinking.

That night, the voicemail came earlier than usual.

3:02 a.m.

Her voice sounded strained. Urgent.

“Honey,” she whispered. “You need to listen to me now.”

I stood frozen in the middle of my living room, phone pressed to my ear.

“I can see the thing behind you,” she said.

The message cut off.

I didn’t turn around.

I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the wall, every muscle locked, waiting for something to touch me.

The phone buzzed again.

Another voicemail.

Same number.

This time, she sounded scared.

“It doesn’t like that you heard me,” she whispered. “And it’s closer than last time.”

I didn’t turn around.

I know that sounds deliberate, like some brave decision, but it wasn’t. I physically couldn’t make myself move. My muscles locked in place the way they do when you miss a step on the stairs and your body freezes before the fall.

The apartment was silent.

No breathing behind me. No footsteps. No shift in the air. Just the low hum of the refrigerator and the faint ringing in my ears.

I stayed like that until my legs started to shake.

When I finally forced myself to turn, there was nothing there.

No shadow. No shape. No distortion in the room. The hallway was empty. The door to my bedroom was open the way I always leave it. The bathroom light was still on.

I shut it off and locked myself in my bedroom.

I didn’t sleep.

Around dawn, I replayed the voicemail again. Slower this time. I listened for background noise, distortion, anything that would suggest it was recorded somewhere else.

There was none.

But there was something else.

Between her words, buried low under the whisper, I heard another sound.

Breathing.

Not hers.

Too deep. Too slow. Like someone standing very close to the phone, trying not to be noticed.

That was the first time I cried.

Not loud. Not dramatically. Just sitting on the edge of the bed with my face in my hands, shaking, feeling stupid and small for still wanting her to be real.

I went to the police later that morning.

I didn’t tell them I thought my dead mother was watching me. I told them someone was stalking me and spoofing her number. That someone was inside my apartment.

They checked the locks. The windows. The fire escape. Everything was secure. No signs of forced entry. No hidden cameras they could find.

One of them asked if I was sleeping.

I lied and said yes.

Before they left, my phone buzzed.

A voicemail.

Right in front of them.

Same number.

I didn’t play it.

They exchanged a look that said more than any words could. The kind that quietly redefines you in someone else’s mind.

After they left, I played the message.

Her voice was softer this time. Almost tired.

“You shouldn’t have brought strangers here,” she whispered. “It doesn’t like them.”

My blood went cold.

That night, I tried something different.

I left my phone in the living room and went into the bedroom, shutting the door. I sat on the bed with the lights off, forcing myself not to check the time.

At 3 a.m., my phone buzzed.

I didn’t hear it.

I heard her anyway.

From inside the apartment.

Not loud. Not clear.

Just a whisper, slipping through the walls.

“You’re in the bedroom,” she said. “Facing the door.”

I squeezed my eyes shut and pressed my hands over my ears.

The whisper continued.

“It’s standing in the hallway,” she said. “I don’t think it knows I can see it yet.”

The bedroom door creaked.

Not opening.

Just settling.

My phone buzzed again.

I didn’t need to look to know it was another voicemail.

Her voice shook now.

“Please,” she whispered. “When it moves, don’t react. It watches your face.”

Something shifted outside the door.

A soft scrape against the floor. Slow. Careful.

Like a foot adjusting its position.

The whisper came one last time, so faint I almost missed it.

“It’s learning how you breathe.”

The phone vibrated again.

This time, the voicemail didn’t stop.

The line stayed open.

And underneath my mother’s breathing, I heard something else inhale.

Closer than it should have been.

I didn’t answer the voicemail.

I couldn’t.

The screen stayed lit on my nightstand, the call timer still counting up like someone on the other end was waiting for me to say hello. I watched the seconds tick by until the display finally went dark on its own.

The breathing didn’t stop.

It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t even threatening. Just steady. Patient. Close enough that I could feel it more than hear it, like pressure against my awareness.

I stayed perfectly still.

Minutes passed. Or hours. I don’t know. Time stopped behaving normally after that. Eventually, the breathing faded, thinning out until it was impossible to tell if it was really gone or if my ears had just given up.

When the sun finally came up, I was still sitting upright in bed, muscles aching like I’d run a marathon.

I skipped work. Again.

I spent the morning tearing the apartment apart. I checked vents, outlets, the space above the cabinets. I pulled furniture away from the walls, looking for holes, crawl spaces, anything that could explain how someone could be inside without me knowing.

There was nothing.

But I kept finding small signs that I hadn’t noticed before.

The rug in the hallway was slightly off-center, like it had been nudged by a careful foot. One of the dining chairs had a faint smear of dust on the backrest at shoulder height. The shower curtain was damp, even though I hadn’t used it.

None of it was dramatic enough to prove anything.

All of it was intimate enough to feel wrong.

That afternoon, I went through my old voicemails. The ones from before she died. Her real voice. Clear. Solid. Grounded in a body that needed air and pauses.

I compared them side by side.

The new messages had the same cadence, the same habits. The way she lingered on certain words. The way she softened her voice when she said my name.

But there were differences.

She never used contractions anymore.

She never laughed.

And she always sounded like she was whispering from very close to something she didn’t want to wake.

The next voicemail came early.

2:41 a.m.

I was still awake, sitting on the couch with every light on, back pressed to the wall. My phone buzzed in my hand instead of on the table.

I answered it.

I don’t know why. Maybe some part of me needed it to be real. Needed to hear her say my name again, even like this.

“Mom?” I whispered.

There was a long pause.

Then her voice, strained and urgent. “You shouldn’t talk out loud anymore.”

My throat closed. “Where are you?”

Another pause. Longer this time.

“I’m not where I was,” she said carefully. “I’m not where you think I am either.”

“What is it?” I asked. “What’s in my apartment?”

I heard her inhale.

“It moved in when you did,” she said. “You gave it shape.”

The lights flickered.

Just once.

I felt it then. Not a touch. Not a presence. A shift. Like the space behind me had decided it was occupied.

“Don’t turn around,” she whispered. “It knows your habits. It’s been practicing.”

My heart hammered so hard I thought I might pass out. “Practicing what?”

“Standing still,” she said. “Breathing shallow. Watching without blinking.”

The call crackled.

Her voice dropped even lower.

“I can see it clearly now,” she whispered. “It’s very proud of how well it’s doing.”

Something warm brushed the back of my neck.

Not a hand.

A breath.

My phone buzzed again.

Another voicemail coming in.

While the call was still connected.

Her voice sharpened, panicked for the first time since this started.

“It figured out how I’m watching,” she whispered. “And it doesn’t like being seen.”

The lights went out.

The apartment plunged into darkness so complete it felt heavy.

I heard movement behind me. Slow. Careful. Like someone afraid of making a mistake.

Then my phone speaker crackled, and her voice came through one last time.

“You have to leave before it learns how to sound like me.”

Something leaned close to my ear.

And in my mother’s exact voice, it whispered my name.

I ran.

I don’t remember standing up or grabbing my keys. I remember the door slamming open and the cold hallway air hitting my face like water. I didn’t turn on lights. I didn’t look back. I took the stairs two at a time, heart punching against my ribs so hard it hurt.

Behind me, something moved.

Not fast. Not chasing.

Keeping pace.

I made it outside and kept going until my lungs burned and my legs gave out. I slept in my car with the seat pushed back, phone powered off, hands shaking until morning came.

For two days, nothing happened.

No voicemails. No whispers. No sense of being watched. I started to believe distance mattered. That whatever had been learning me was bound to the apartment.

I went back on the third day.

I needed clothes. Documents. Proof that my life still existed somewhere solid.

The apartment looked untouched. Lights off. Air stale. Quiet in the way empty places get when they’ve been waiting.

I moved fast. Bag. Closet. Drawer. No pauses.

My phone stayed off.

That was my mistake.

I was halfway through the bedroom when I heard it.

My mother humming.

Low. Familiar. The tune she used to hum while folding laundry, when she thought no one was listening.

It came from the living room.

I stood frozen, bag slipping from my hand.

“I told you not to come back,” she said softly.

I didn’t answer.

“I tried to warn you,” she continued. “It was watching how you react to my voice. Measuring the pauses. The breathing.”

Something shifted in the hallway. Careful. Deliberate.

“You gave it permission when you listened,” she whispered. “You made it real.”

My phone vibrated in my pocket.

Powered off.

I pulled it out anyway.

One new voicemail.

No number. No timestamp.

I didn’t play it.

The humming stopped.

Footsteps crossed the living room. Slow. Heavy. Learning how to carry weight.

“I can’t see it anymore,” my mother whispered from the bedroom speaker. “That means it can see me.”

The phone screen lit up by itself.

The voicemail began to play.

Her voice came through clearly now. Strong. Confident.

Too confident.

“It’s okay,” she said gently. “I’m right behind you.”

Warm breath touched my ear.

Not whispered.

Spoken.

In perfect rhythm with the voice on the phone.

I ran again. Left everything behind. I never went back.

I live somewhere else now. New place. New locks. Different layout. I don’t keep mirrors near doorways. I don’t answer unknown numbers. I don’t listen to voicemails anymore.

At night, I sit very still.

Because sometimes, just before 3 a.m., my phone lights up without sound.

No notification.

Just the screen.

And a message that never finishes loading.

Mom is recording…

I don’t delete it.

I don’t open it.

I just hold my breath and hope that whatever learned my mother’s voice hasn’t figured out yet how to sound like me.",1,1766986037.0,u_NightmareNarratives-,0,1.0,False

One day I just realized I was never actually alone with my own thoughts. There was always something playing in the background music in the shower podcasts while I cleaned Tik Toks while I ate some kind of noise just so it would not be silent

  
Nothing about that is wrong but after a while my brain started to feel cluttered like my mind was always halfway somewhere else. Constant noise and digital input can really drain attention and leave you feeling overstimulated and tired

​

  
So I tried something small. I let normal tasks be quiet. I drank my coffee without scrolling. I walked without headphones. I folded laundry without any background sound. At first it felt uncomfortable like my brain did not know what to do without a distraction but after a few days something shifted

  
Time started to feel slower in a gentle way. I felt more present like I was actually inside my day instead of chasing it from one notification to the next. Silence and simple mindfulness can lower stress and help your thoughts feel clearer almost like someone turned down the volume in your head

​

  
I do not know if this counts as simple living or just giving my mind room to breathe but it has made life feel lighter and more peaceful

I don't regret moving because I really like where we live, but I have not really been able to form any lasting connections/friendships during that time. It's been easier for him to meet and befriend people through his work, but I still work remotely for a company in our hometown, so I don't see people face-to-face on a daily basis like he does. 

I've joined various classes and clubs and I've made some casual friends/acquaintances, but I haven't clicked with anyone. I don't feel truly comfortable or at ease with anyone I know here. I don't feel like I have a friend that I could vent to or speak with on a deep and personal level; all my interactions are very surface level. 

I'm not very good at traditional ""hanging out"" where you sit with someone over a coffee or a meal and chat. I prefer to socialize through structured activities like work or hobbies and slowly grow friendships that way (i.e., parallel play), but it's been really hard starting over in a completely new place where I work remotely and don't know anyone. (And yes, I have thought of getting a new job, but remote work has really helped me minimize burnout, and there are very few jobs in my industry where I live.)

My husband has to go out of town for two weeks to deal with a family emergency back home, and I'm realizing that I really have nobody else here besides him that I'm close to. Faced with two weeks of utter solitude, I'm forced to confront the fact that I'm lonely. It feels really depressing and discouraging. Making friends as an adult is hard; making friends as an autistic adult while trying to honor my needs and not overextend myself/mask heavily seems nearly impossible.

1pydmzt,https://photos.app.goo.gl/89ZquGYSMXEFjTGaA,Thanks to all of you,"Many years ago, I started coming to this sub for advice with my first girl, Moki. She was so small, very dainty, loved to play, and coffee (cold, no sugar, decaf, lol). She needed a buddy, so we got Oppy (sounds like happy) and she had really scraggly fur, a little stinker than most. But she was SMART. I taught her to roll over in an afternoon, she was my little shadow, followed me everywhere. Of course I needed a boy after that, so we got Kumo. Cream colored, and loved his ladies. Every night before bed, he would do his rounds around the apartment checking the doors and floors, then run up into their enclosure. Finally, I saw Remo. He was at a local garden lawn center, and I couldn't resist; didnt tell my husband, just bought him and had to get him out of there. I learned, here, that he has Waardenburgs Syndrome. They say its in all black and white, or panda color ferrets. Because of irresponsible or inbreeding, it can be quite common; wide forehead, stubby tail, and deaf. Because they cant hear when they're being rough with others. So, we taught him hand signals, and he somehow picked up rolling over whenever he wants something. If I see his little pink belly, I know hes asking politely. 
Moki got older, no longer make it around, as she declined, we chose to let her go before she was in too much pain.
Very shortly after, I realized Oppy broke her tooth, and I was so upset seeing her in pain, I took her to the vet that day and said goodbye. Kumo developed insulinomas, and was just winding down like an old clock, so he too, we chose to say goodbye before he suffered anymore.
Now, im divorced (we're still great friends) and its just me and Remo. Hes 9, still shows me his pink belly when he wants something, and as much as im not looking forward to it, I will let him cross the rainbow bridge before I make him suffer one day.
At that point, its not about what I want or how sad I will be, but what an amazing life he had, burrowing, playing in bags, having treats with the others, and not ever having suffered.

Anyway, I wanted to post this because I am SO grateful for all of the knowledge all of you here have given me, so I could give my fur babies the best lives possible. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Here's a few photos, Remo got stuck in a sock... you'll see what I mean lol.

\*\*\*

“God I hate doing this.”

I pointed the gun to my subordinate's head. He was tied to a chair. He had tears in his eyes. The worst part about doing this is how resigned they are. He didn’t plead or ask for forgiveness.

All he said was, “I’m sorry.”

“I certainly hope so.”

I pulled the trigger. With a loud bang, I saw the life drain out of my most loyal supporter. Along with his blood. I meant to aim for his heart, but everybody knows I’m a terrible shot. That’s why I have my henchmen do it.

Speaking of henchmen, I turned around to face my employees.

“I don’t ask for much, guys. I give y’all everything”, I said as I paced the small stage. “100k a year, six weeks vacation, unlimited sick days, health insurance and dental, do you know how many people don’t get dental?”, I briefly stopped pacing for emphasis.

“All I ask is for you guys to do simple tasks. Guard the hostages, drive the van, actually hit the heroes when I ask you to shoot them. Is that really too much to ask?”

“I can’t be everywhere at once and I am just one man. A man with flaws and weaknesses and failures. I need you guys to pick up the slack.”

I took my leave.

The next day, Merabell handed me my coffee. Since Gerald is dead, she has moved up to my de facto right hand woman. She asked me if I was alright now that I had a night to think about it.

“Do you think I’m too hard on them?”’ I asked.

She didn’t hesitate to answer. “Absolutely not. Sometimes they need someone to put the boot down. Besides, they knew what they’re signing up for.”

I took a pensive sip. “Y’know I have had to do three purges since I started my mission?”

She shook her head.

“Yeah, out of the four batches of subordinates I’ve led, I think these guys are the best. Personality wise. They’re eager to please, obedient, patient and they work so hard, but you know what I always say-“

“You can work as hard as you want to, but the results speak for themselves, I’ve heard it a million times.” I smiled at her.

We sat in silence for a while.

“I gave him like, eight chances.”

“I know.”

I sighed.

“I know this is short notice, but can you finish that report I assigned him? I need it by tomorrow.”

“Sure, thing, James,” she got up to leave.

She paused by the door.

“You know, despite the murder and all of the illegal things you have me do on a daily basis, I think you’re the best boss I’ve ever had, and I’m not being a kiss up when I say that the rest of the crew agrees.”

Well on that note, I feel much better.",1,1766985116.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False
1pydfvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pydfvr/idk_how_to_title_things_its_about_lungs_lol/,(idk how to title things its about lungs lol),"My name is Katie. I'm 30 and I can't speak on my own. Every time I wanna speak I either have to type what I say or use one of those texts to say things where I type something and it automatically speaks for me. I have been feeling so unbearably lonely since I lost my ability. My husband said that it would be good for me to tell my story to a group of random people on the internet . I have nothing better to do. So I told him why not. 

I was diagnosed with asthma at the age of twelve but I think I have had it since I was born. My mother didn't want to believe that her child was sick. She told me multiple times that I ""wasn't like those people” and that I “need to stop faking it and to just breathe.” no matter how many doctors or how many tests she still wouldn't believe me. She believed that asthma was just your lungs not working hard enough and that with exercise and breathing exercises you could be cured. But nothing worked for me so I started just hiding and keeping my emergency inhalers whenever I got them or if I could swipe them off of some poor other asthmatic kid in my school. Looking back that was such a stupid thing to do and could have probably have gotten some poor kid killed. But it's what I had to do. And so I did for about five years. 

It was the middle of February in Berks County Pennsylvania. I was outside shoveling the driveway. I had just run out of whatever stolen inhaler that I had that month and my lungs were not happy with the cold. I kept pushing myself more and more, wanting to just get all of this done so that I could go inside. The more I pushed the more my chest felt tight and a weird rattle started to form in my chest as well. But I kept pushing. And pushing. And pushing. Soon I couldn't breathe. My body felt like it was on fire and cold at the same time I kept gasping and trying to stand. My mind racing with thoughts of what to do, should I sit or stand? Am I breathing enough? What's going on? I want my mom…the last thing I remember before passing out was the sound of my head hitting the driveway and my mom screaming my name. 

 I woke up in the hospital with my mom by my side on her phone. The sounds of the machines and the soft sounds of whatever game my mom was playing is what I woke up to. Exhausted and feeling like my head was gonna fall off I turned and faced my mom. 

“Mom?” I ask quietly, still groggy and confused “what happened?”  my mom quickly looked up from her phone a shocked and worried look spread on her face as she hurriedly came to my bedside petting my hair and trying not to cry. 

“Oh sweetheart you had one of your fits again and you didn't wake up so I called 911 and when you got here I told them that you were okay and that you would wake up and that  I refused to believe that your lungs are weak.” My mom looked at the door and back at me with a facial expression I have never seen my mom make ever again in her life. She looked like she knew deep down she was wrong and that something was wrong. My mom talked to me for a while about what I had missed. Turns out I was unconscious for about two days and that I stopped breathing for only a few seconds. 

After a few nurses came in and checked my vitals a doctor walked in. She was old, probably in her fifties, she had grey hair that was pulled back in a bun that made her look like the meanest woman in the world.  She never looked happy when I saw her. And that day she probably looked the most pissed off.

 “Hello Katie you may not know me but I am Doctor Thomas and I have been the doctor  that has been taking care of you. Has your mom told you everything?” she looks over at my mom who shakes her head and I sit there confused “wait mom i thought you did?” I look around confused and disoriented 

“I thought that all I did was pass out” I look over at Doctor Thomas with a confused expression.

 “Katie we needed to do a scan on your chest. One of the nurses was listening to your breathing while you slept and something didn't sound right. And after checking what the x-ray had scanned we found a mass sitting in the top left of your right lung.” 

I was only fifteen when the first “cancer” diagnosis was stated. So naturally they started everything: chemo, surgery, pills, breathing treatments. But every time we thought something was working a mass would just form onto a different side of my lung. For two years we fought this and for two years I laid in hospital bed after hospital bed wishing I would wake up just to find out that this was just a horrible dream. 

Finally two years, five months, and twenty-seven days later I was finally cancer free. I still had to do breathing treatments, get a scan once every few months and keep an inhaler on me but since I was in the hospital my mother finally let me have the inhaler. She hated it. Only let me have it if her “breathing exercises” didn't work. I never told my mom that after her breathing treatments and my inhaler I felt something still. It felt like something was knocking on my lung bumping into it every time I took a deep breath. 

I don't speak to my mother now. I have no idea where she is or what she is up to or anything else in her life. The last time I checked she remarried and had another child. That one looked healthy. And pray to god everyday her new child doesn't have the same curse as me.

 I lived on with my life. I quickly moved out after high school and went to college where I met my amazing husband. I never told anyone about the thumping in my lungs. I didnt wanna seem crazy or be called one of those people who believe they're sick but they really aren't. All of my scans since I was told I was clear where normal. No bumps or masses or anything. I looked up other people having weird feelings in their lungs for no reason and I came across a guy who had a whole tree growing inside of him. All because he inhaled a seed. It turns out the human lungs are a nice, dark, moist environment for a plant to grow. I had to stop looking stuff up. I was freaking myself out too much. 

God I wish I spoke up more about what I was feeling. Maybe if I did they could have saved me from all of this. Saved me from whatever that thing was in my lungs. Well as the years go by I noticed my breathing was starting to go back to how it was when I was twelve. Blowing out candles became a chore. I brushed it off and just used my inhaler more thinking maybe I just had a cold. My husband Sam noticed and he started getting worried. One day he found me sitting on the couch panting. Face red and sweaty. 

“Sweetheart, are you okay?” he asked, kneeling down to face me. I nod trying to catch my breath.

 “I'm fine , I swear.” I smiled weakly at him “I just had a hard time going up the stairs with the groceries.” I looked over at the counter at the two bags filled with some food that we needed for that night.

“You're calling the doctor tomorrow and getting an appointment.” Sam said in a very worried tone “your breathing has been getting worse in the past few weeks. I worry about you Katie. What if you pass or what if the cancer is back? I mean I know it's been five years but still five years cancer free it could still come back.” 

I knew he was right and I hated making him worry so I made one doctor's appointment that might have well have been an email. I went in and they did a scan and looked it over and said my lungs were clear and that my breathing was probably worse due to the treatment I had as a kid. My lungs didn't grow as they should have. So being an adult with smaller lungs means not being able to breathe as much. I should have yelled at those doctors begging for more tests to see what was going on. 

I went home thinking everything was fine and that my lungs were just overcompensating since they were smaller and the knocking was just my heart beating. Later that night I had a bad asthma attack. One of the worst ones in a long while. I took my emergency inhaler and went and sat outside on the back porch taking deep breaths trying to calm myself down. As I was calming myself down I started to feel that knocking again. It was normal at first just a small rhythm on my chest like a heart beat. But it grew and it felt more and more like someone was punching my chest. I took a sip of water trying to slow my heart rate thinking my heart was just confused or something but it didn't work. A huge knock came at my throat and the water went right back up and threw up the water. Coughing, I sit on the floor of the porch, tears falling. The knocking kept coming at my throat. My airway is being cut off every time. And as suddenly as it came the knocking stopped. I sat there breathing in the night air calming my flow of tears for what felt like an hour.

 I made my way back inside finally being able to lay back down and sleep. That morning however. I woke up alone like normal Sam went into work so I was alone for a few hours before I had to go in. I walk into the bathroom and open the door looking in the mirror I see a huge bruise on my neck right where my collar bone is. Like something punched me in the throat. It didn't hurt to swallow or anything and breathing was like the past few days. I just assumed it happened while throwing up last night in some weird accident. I brushed it off and started to make myself coffee and breakfast. Sitting on the couch I ate my yummy breakfast of an ice cream sundae pop tart and peppermint mocha coffee. The coffee went down just fine but as I started to eat my pop tart I felt like it got stuck with a mix of wanting to vomit. I threw up the pop tart and coffee. Sighing I assumed I had just a stomach bug. I called my office telling them I wouldn't be coming in and that I would be working from home that day. The only good thing to come from covid. Then I texted Sam telling him I was working from home and that I didn't feel good. Sam wouldn't see my text messages till after his day at work. He still blames himself for what happened. I can't stop him from having a busy day nor did either of us know what was going to happen. 

Most of the day went by normally vomiting whenever I ate or drank anything. The only things I could keep down were warm liquids. Around 3 pm I just finished up some work and was gonna take a nap. I got up and made my way to the bedroom but as I was walking down the hallway I felt the knocking again on my throat. The same punching feeling. I stop walking and try to take deep breaths. Once again my breathing was being cut off from the knocking. I quickly turn around and start to make my way to the bathroom to get my inhaler thinking it was a bad asthma attack. I attempt to take the inhaler. The minute it reached my lungs the knocking came back harder. I coughed and a fat wad of mucus came out and I spit it out in the sink coughing again. I sat on the toilet coughing and coughing up mucus for what felt like forever the more I coughed up the more bloody it became and the harder it became to breathe. I texted Sam for the last time telling him I'm having a horrible asthma attack and that I was calling 911 to come help since my inhaler wasn't working. As I started to dial 911 I coughed hard again this time I could feel something in my throat moving. Like a lump I couldn't breath, all I could do was spit up more of the weird mucus blood mix. I pressed the call button on 911 and tried to gasp my words but nothing came out. All the lady could hear on the other end was my desperate gags and coughs to get any air in or out of my lungs. I dropped my phone and fell onto the cold tile floor. Gagging and gasping I held onto my throat as I felt my throat stretch to a size that hurt like hell. My face and core were on fire, tears streaming down my eyes as I felt whatever was in my throat growing and getting larger. My hands felt under the skin on my neck, something pulsing and moving. That's when I heard the most sickening crack. Following the crack was the worst pain I had ever felt. My jaw was broken. I let out a wet gurgling cry as this thing forces its way out of my mouth. I never saw what came out of me. I passed out before then. But from what I was told the paramedics broke in and found me passed out on the floor in a puddle of blood. They rushed me to surgery and found my vocal cords and jaw were a mess. It looked like something was forcibly shoved down my throat over and over and over again. They told me I would never talk again. Or if I did it would be only a few words at a time. I'm older now and all I have are scars to show what happened. But late at night when everything is quiet and all I can hear the slight wheeze in my breathing. I remember. I remember that thing that was coming out of me. And I pray to whatever god is out there that no one else ever has to go through what I did.

When they called him up to honor his parents, I smoothed my dress and stood.


Then every light in the room swung toward the door.


My husband walked in. The one who'd been dead for thirty years.


And a woman clung to his arm.


She walked straight to the microphone.


""Thank you all for celebrating our son's wedding.""


""I'll be taking over from here. Juliet's done her part. Time to step aside.""


She tucked herself into his chest. Glowing at me.


I couldn't breathe.


After that, I locked myself in the bathroom.


My hand found the letter in my pocket.


Twenty-year-old Grayson had written it to me.


I pulled out a pen. Hands shaking.


Wrote beneath his faded handwriting:


\[You're a liar. Stay away from me.\]


Before the ink dried, new words actually bled through the page!


\[Who is this? Stop writing on my letter to Jules.\]


My hand shook. A tear splashed onto the page.


\[The man you become just broke my heart.\]


Long pause.


Then his reply formed—fierce, certain:


\[That's impossible! I would never hurt Jules. Not ever!\]


\[If I betray her, I hope I die alone and forgotten!\]


...


My son got married on Christmas Day.


When the officiant called the groom forward to honor his parents, I stood and smoothed my dress, ready to take my place on stage.


Then the lights shifted toward the entrance.


And there he was.


Grayson.


The man who was supposed to have sacrificed himself thirty years ago.


Silver touched his temples now. He wore a sharp charcoal suit.


And on his arm was Savannah.


She strode straight to the microphone, chin high, voice ringing clear across the room.


""Thank you all for coming to celebrate OUR son's wedding.""


""I'm so grateful to finally take my rightful place in this family."" Her eyes found mine.""Juliet's played her part long enough. Time to make room.""


She tucked herself into his side, glowing.


The applause was immediate. Thunderous.


I couldn't breathe. My legs were already moving.


I ran into the bathroom, door slamming behind me.


I fumbled for the letter in my pocket. The one I'd carried with me for decades, folded so many times the creases had worn soft.


Twenty-year-old Grayson had written it under the oak tree behind campus.


Just then, his voice drifted through the door.


""Juliet. I just wanted to say thank you. For all of it.""


Hearing his words, my shaking hand found a pen.


I pressed it to the paper beneath his faded handwriting and wrote:


\[Grayson, you're a liar. Don't come near me.\]


Before the ink even dried, new words appeared—faint, boyish script.


\[Who is this? Stop writing on my letter to Juliet.\]


My hand shook. A tear splashed onto the page.


\[Because thirty years from now, you destroy me.\]


A beat. Then his reply formed, fierce and sure:


\[That's impossible. I would never let Juliet down. Not ever.\]


I stared at those words and felt something crack open inside me.


\[You don't know that yet. But you will.\]


On the other side of the page, I could feel him wanting to argue back.


He'd probably write something like ""I keep my promises.""


I didn't wait to see.


Just folded the letter and tucked it back into the deepest pocket of my dress.


I pushed open the bathroom door. The noise and crowd hit me all at once.


Grayson stood near the stage, talking to someone.


Thirty years had changed him.


He still stood tall, but everything else was different. The suit, the haircut, the way he carried himself—it was all wrong. Sharper. Colder.


But when he looked up, something in his eyes—just for a second—looked familiar.


And that hurt so worse.


""Juliet.""


He walked over, voice steady and low.


""Thank you. For everything. For holding things together all these years. For raising our son. Look at him—he turned out great. You did that.""


Our son.


I felt those words like a punch.


""Thank me?"" My voice cracked. ""You want to thank me?""


He hesitated.


""Grayson—where were you?""


His smile slipped. Like he hadn't expected me to actually ask.


""It was complicated—""


""Too complicated to write? Too complicated to come home?"" I stepped closer. ""But not too complicated to start over with her?""


Savannah appeared next to him in her red dress, all smiles.


""Oh, Juliet. Thanks for stepping aside back then. He's been wonderful to me. Must've been tough, playing the grieving wife all those years.""


Rage flooded through me.


Before I knew what I was doing, my hand was already swinging toward her face.


A hand locked around my wrist. Stopped me cold.


""Mom—stop.""


My son's grip was tight. It sent a sharp ache through my chest.


""It's my wedding. Can you not make a scene for one day?""


He didn't even try to hide his irritation.


""I invited Dad. Sava's been great to me. Why can't you just deal with it?""


His words cut straight through me.


I stared at my son—the boy I'd raised by myself—watching him shield her like I was the threat.


He felt like a stranger.


""You knew."" My throat closed up. ""You knew the whole time.""


It felt like my heart was being crushed in someone's fist.


""You were in on it. All of you.""


""I didn't want to upset you,"" he said, annoyed. ""Dad's been through a lot. Everyone's fine now. Why do you have to make it into a thing?""


Grayson stepped forward and put his arm around Savannah.


""Don't take it personally, honey. She just needs time.""


Then he shot me a cold look and his voice turned sharp.


""You're being ridiculous, Juliet. Act your age.""


Savannah sighed, all sympathy.


""Grayson, don't be too hard on her. This must be hard.""


But she still leaned into him while she said it.


My son immediately handed her a tissue.


""You okay? Sorry. My mom gets emotional.""


The three of them stood there like a damn perfect family.


I dug my nails into my palm to stay standing.


Chapter 2


This wasn't a nightmare I could wake up from.


This was my actual life. Thirty years of it.


I watched Grayson walk away and suddenly I was back in that small town in West Virginia. Thirty-some years ago.


We were both volunteers in the community service program.


He'd wake up before dawn just to help me set up the breakfast line at the church.


During lunch breaks, we'd sit on the back steps and he'd pull out whatever he'd grabbed from the kitchen—usually a roll or some fruit.


He'd split it down the middle and hand me half.


He wasn't smooth. Couldn't flirt to save his life.


But every morning there'd be coffee waiting for me.


And he'd fix anything that broke around the community center without being asked.


We got married at the courthouse.


No fancy dress. No reception. Just spaghetti afterward with a handful of friends.


He held my hand on those courthouse steps and said, ""Jules, once I get on my feet, I'm gonna give you everything.""


I believed every word. So did everyone else.


Less than three months later, the deployment letter came.


He came back from the recruitment office looking proud and guilty all at once.


The night before he shipped out, he held me and cried. His whole body shook.


""Soon as this tour's over, I'm coming home. I swear.""


At the bus station, I wouldn't let go.


The driver honked twice before Grayson finally pulled away and climbed on board.


He pressed his hand against the window and yelled,


""Wait for me! Jules—promise you'll wait!""


I had no idea I was already pregnant.


After he left, I kept everything together.


Worked double shifts at the diner. Took care of his parents at night. Rubbed my stomach and whispered to the baby, ""Your daddy's a hero.""


I kept his letters in my nightstand. Read them before bed every single night.


\[I miss you so much.\]


\[Can't wait to come home and meet our kid.\]


Then the letters came slower. Then they stopped.


One morning, a military car pulled up outside. An officer got out holding a folded flag.


Grayson had been killed in action.


I collapsed on the porch. When I came to, I cried for three days straight.


But there was a baby coming. And his parents couldn't manage on their own.


So I swallowed it all and went back to work.


When my son was born, I named him after his father. Every letter of that name was a promise I made to a dead man.


I did everything alone.


Worked my shifts. Changed diapers and walked the floors at night.


His parents were always sick. I practically lived at the pharmacy picking up prescriptions.


A couple years later, a letter arrived. Postmarked from Charleston.


His parents shut themselves in their bedroom to read it.


When I asked what it said, they told me it was nothing. Just some old army buddy checking in.


A few weeks after that, they said they needed to see a specialist upstate. Packed their bags and left.


It wasn't until years later that I heard something from Grayson's cousin.


Some officer named Grayson. Got remarried in Charleston. To a woman from the money.


I didn't connect the dots. Not then. I was too trusting.


Now I understand.


They weren't going to see a doctor. They were going to his wedding.


I'd already been erased.


My husband was alive. His parents knew. Eventually my son knew too.


I was the only one still believing the lie.


Holding onto ""Gold Star widow"" like it meant something.


Thirty years.


Whatever we had back in that community center kitchen? Been gone a long time.


Chapter 3


The next day, my son stopped by with his new wife.


They tiptoed around me like I was made of glass. Didn't say a word about his father.


I smiled. Nodded. Played the part of a mom who'd just had too much to drink at the reception.


But inside? Completely gutted.


After they left, the silence pressed in.


I sat on the couch staring at nothing. My eyes drifted to the coffee table. Then the trash can beside it.


The letter.


I pulled it out.


And stopped breathing.


Overnight, the empty spaces had filled in. Lines and lines of cramped handwriting.


No more anger. Just... him.


Talking like I was the only person in the world who'd listen.


\[I don't know who you are, but I couldn't sleep after what you said.\]


\[I keep wondering—if you know Jules, where is she right now? Is she safe? Did something happen?\]


\[Training was brutal today. Full pack, five miles in the Georgia heat. But I thought about her waiting and I just kept going.\]


\[We deploy in forty-eight hours. I'm not scared of dying. I'm scared of what happens to her if I don't come back.\]


\[She's too trusting. What if someone takes advantage? If you really know the future, just tell me—does she end up okay?\]


Every word raw. Unguarded.


No calculation. No distance. Just a twenty-year-old who loved someone.


It knocked the wind out of me.


Suddenly I was back on that porch, holding the folded flag, the world spinning.


His parents too sick to work. Me pulling doubles at the diner, coming home to sort their medications, eyes burning, baby screaming himself raw in my arms.


People in town whispered I was cursed. That I'd brought it on myself. I stayed inside with my son and cried where nobody could hear.


So many nights I stared at his photo until my pillow was drenched.


He never knew any of that.


This version of Grayson still thought he was coming home. Still believed we had a future.


I picked up the pen. My hand shook.


\[You won't keep your promise. You'll survive. But you won't come back to her.\]


\[You'll leave her waiting. Let her cry herself empty. Let her think you're dead while you build a whole new life.\]


The ink barely dried before his reply came—frantic, almost tearing the page.


\[NO. That's a lie. I would NEVER.\]


\[I write her constantly. I think about her every second. I PROMISED.\]


I stared at that word.


\[Promises are easy when you're twenty. Time changes people. It'll change you too.\]


\[You'll start over. New city. New wife. And Jules will just be someone you used to know.\]


\[I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.\]


His handwriting was jagged now.


\[If I ever betray her, I hope I die alone and forgotten!\]


The same conviction. The same fire he had on those courthouse steps when he swore he'd take care of me forever.


But I felt nothing.

\*\*\*

“God I hate doing this.”

I pointed the gun to my subordinate's head. He was tied to a chair. He had tears in his eyes. The worst part about doing this is how resigned they are. He didn’t plead or ask for forgiveness. 

All he said was, “I’m sorry.”

“I certainly hope so.”

I pulled the trigger. With a loud bang, I saw the life drain out of my most loyal supporter. Along with his blood. I meant to aim for his heart, but everybody knows I’m a terrible shot. That’s why I have my henchmen do it.

Speaking of henchmen, I turned around to face my employees.

“I don’t ask for much, guys. I give y’all everything”, I said as I paced the small stage. “100k a year, six weeks vacation, unlimited sick days, health insurance and dental, do you know how many people don’t get dental?”, I briefly stopped pacing for emphasis.

“All I ask is for you guys to do simple tasks. Guard the hostages, drive the van, actually hit the heroes when I ask you to shoot them. Is that really too much to ask?” 

“I can’t be everywhere at once and I am just one man. A man with flaws and weaknesses and failures. I need you guys to pick up the slack.”

I took my leave.

The next day, Merabell handed me my coffee. Since Gerald is dead, she has moved up to my de facto right hand woman. She asked me if I was alright now that I had a night to think about it.

“Do you think I’m too hard on them?”’ I asked.

She didn’t hesitate to answer. “Absolutely not. Sometimes they need someone to put the boot down. Besides, they knew what they’re signing up for.”

I took a pensive sip. “Y’know I have had to do three purges since I started my mission?”

She shook her head.

“Yeah, out of the four batches of subordinates I’ve led, I think these guys are the best. Personality wise. They’re eager to please, obedient, patient and they work so hard, but you know what I always say-“

“You can work as hard as you want to, but the results speak for themselves, I’ve heard it a million times.” I smiled at her.

We sat in silence for a while.

“I gave him like, eight chances.”

“I know.”

I sighed. 

“I know this is short notice, but can you finish that report I assigned him? I need it by tomorrow.”

“Sure, thing, James,” she got up to leave.

She paused by the door.

“You know, despite the murder and all of the illegal things you have me do on a daily basis, I think you’re the best boss I’ve ever had, and I’m not being a kiss up when I say that the rest of the crew agrees.”

Well on that note, I feel much better.",1,1766984835.0,fiction,0,1.0,False
1pydcja,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pydcja/iced_vs_cold_brew/,Iced vs Cold Brew,"I looked around here for this but only found separate posts regarding either cold brew or iced coffee. 

My question is, which one would be preferable as someone who enjoys specialty pour overs; I've been brewing hot pour over for over 3 years. V60, Kalita Wave, Clever, Aeropress, Fellow Aiden, espresso, etc. 

I grind the beans with the ZP6 or Ode 2, usually coarse. And I recently quit caffeine so I've been using only specialty decaf for a few months, it tastes as good and costs the same. I like Ethiopian, Rwanda and Kenian natural light roast.

I've usually drink it too slow and about half the cup ends up cold, so I add ice and many times I enjoy it even more that way. I was just wondering for anyone experienced, if maybe cold brew would be even better flavor. I've read that cold brewers use cheaper dark roast from the supermarket. I don't know if I'd like that as I do enjoy the iced coffee with the light roast specialty, it tastes as good or even better than hot, depending on the mood.

Update: thanks everyone confirming what I was suspecting, thus saving me the time and money I would've gone into cold brew. It's settled: iced coffee upgrading to the Japanese method. ",2,1766984817.0,pourover,8,1.0,False

I got to 55 hours just now and decided I needed to break it. I was not hungry or craving food, but I felt generally unwell. I had dizziness, headaches, and fatigue for the last 12 hours. This is my first attempt at any form of fasting and I am a male in my 30s.

Should I be concerned about how I was feeling towards the end? I was told it would be easier after Day 2, but I felt almost like I had a lighter flu. 

Also, my last meal was not a good one leading into the fast. Should I limit specific foods leading into a fast?

Lastly, I consume ~300-400mg of caffeine. I was a powerlifter for years, so I am working on reducing that even further (I was consuming 600+ at my worst). I assume a lot of the headache issue was due to caffeine withdrawal. Should I supplement with caffeine pills (i dont drink coffee, just Celsius and Gorilla Mind) or ween off caffeine a week or two in advance?

Any advice would help. I am frustrated that I couldn't make it. Mentally I was in a good space the whole time. I never felt hungry after Day 1.",4,1766984697.0,fasting,7,1.0,False

He is the sweetest man in the world, but I am constantly irritated with and stressed out by him. I think about ending it all the time, but I worry that I will regret it for the rest of my life. 

I have a lot of mental health issues and a history of trauma and avoidant attachment and I have an extremely hard time voicing my needs to anyone, especially to men. I have been working very hard with my therapist on this and I feel like I'm getting closer to being able to bring up issues with him, but when I think of the list of things that need to change, it is just too long and I feel like we need to break up. I don't think it is possible for all the things to be fixed and given how hard it is for me to bring up issues, this would be a monumental task. Note that my boyfriend has a heart of gold and I know he would genuinely try to fix any problems I bring to him. 

I still feel conflicted about breaking up since I know that I am the one bringing a lot of the issues into our relationship by not being able to discuss problems. If you have any insight on this, I would love to hear it.

It is painful to think of the shock he would feel if I break up him because I know that he will be completely blindsided (given that I never bring up problems). If I break up with him, any ideas on how to mitigate this?

If it is relevant to your advice, here are some of the problems I have:


-Sexual problems: does not understand female anatomy (case in point, he thought the urethra was inside the v). Has been given info about what I like but doesn't know enough to apply it.

-Hygiene issues: is surprisinglyhygienic in every other way, but does not clean his butthole and leaves skidmarks on my sheets (which creates further sexual problems)

-Problem solving skills: didn't know how to get last few weeks of toothpaste out of tube, doesn't know how to cut his toenails so they aren't jagged because ""the clippers are smaller than [his] toenails"". Can't do things like cut open a package in a logical way. Forgot to put a bath mat down so instead of drying himself off in the shower, he walked across the room to get the mat, soaking the entire bathroom. 

-Life skills in general: is a PhD student, but doesn't know how to do any basic tasks- doesn't know how to clean a spill on counter without Clorox wipes. Had to be taught not to leave wet towels on my furniture and couldn't figure out where to hang it (on the towel rack) without being taught. Couldn't figure out how to use my standard stove by himself. Doesn't know how to tell whether or not an item needs to be refrigerated and doesn't think to check. Tried to use the handle of a dirty metal fork on a non-stick pan to help me cook for my family. 

-Planning: travelled to Italy without plug converter, doesn't pack toothpaste and shampoo generally (says he assumed I would have it, but I don't think he ever thought about it). At 9:15am when we were leaving our hotel to get breakfast, assumed we would come back to our room before 10am checkout. Makes dinner reservations without checking whether we have enough time to get there. 

-Observations skills: doesn't notice much- doesn't notice skidmarks on the sheets. If he spills something he will clean it if he notices, but doesn't clean it well because he doesn't observe how far the spill went. My soap and shampoo are in decorative bottles and after 2 years of dating, he can't remember which is which (though they look very different). 

-Finances: living on PhD student stipend but doesn't know how to grocery shop wisely, doesn't know how to price foods out by weight, spends unwisely, doesn't know how to budget, doesn't know anything about investing. Doesn't offer to pay for things, so I end up paying even though I didn't choose the activity in the first place and don't want to include it in my budget.

-Absentminded/careless: spills things frequently, will take a shower with the curtain on the outside and will get water everywhere, dropped and dented my kettle, spilled a glass of red wine in my white rug, put heavy whipping cream instead of almond milk in my coffee without noticing the very different containers or that it turned the coffee white. My cat often pees next to her litter box, so the bathmat can't stay on the floor or it she will pee on it- after my bf showers, I have to go put the bathmat up because he would never remember this. He also steps in cat pee and doesn't notice, then tracks it onto my bedroom carpet.

-Sharing the load: he doesn't drive in the country where we live (US) so when we see each other, I pick him up and I do all of the driving. I would be fine with taking this on, but I also pay for most things. I would also be fine with that, but I also clean all of the dishes and take on all of the mental load in our relationship. I just feel like everything is on me and that I have a companion but not a partner.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/tyZha0j4sD): **October 9, 2025**

Throwaway because I don’t want anyone in my friend group to find this obviously.

Sophie and I (both 27) have been close friends since we were 4. We’re not the “speak every single day laurel/Susannah” type friends, but I genuinely considered her a sister and her parents like an aunt and uncle. Our families are close. My whole family is invited to her wedding, as is my boyfriend’s family (my boyfriend is Sophie’s brother’s best friend). That’s how close we all are. So I wasn’t really surprised when she asked me to be her maid of honour and i think I’ve been a good one.

Well, two weeks ago Sophie, the other bridesmaids, and I went to try on bridesmaid dresses. I thought we all had a good time and that it was a successful trip as we found dresses. 

Apparently not really, because a couple of days later Sophie asked to meet me. She asked that I step down from being maid of honour. She said seeing me in the bridesmaid dress made her realise she just didn’t want me stealing focus from her and that she wouldn’t feel good standing up there knowing everyone was probably comparing us. I was so hurt, I admit I cried right there in the coffee shop. Partly because I never wanted her to think that anyone would be thinking anything other than that she was the most beautiful bride on her wedding day, and partly because I was just so excited to be up there with her and she was kicking me out over something that I couldn’t even control and wasn’t really true. So I said fine, it’s her wedding, if she didn’t want me up there I wouldn’t be, but I wasn’t going to come to the wedding as a guest when clearly my presence was going to be a burden to her. 

Sophie said that wasn’t what she meant, and I asked her to explain. She said she desperately wanted me there so she was going to put aside her feelings but she just wanted pictures at the alter to be with her looking the best and to have that moment with everyone looking at her up there. She also wanted me to tell everyone I dropped out because I was too busy. I said none of this felt fair and I wasn’t going to lie for her. I was a good friend and did nothing wrong and she was being a brat but that was her prerogative and I didn’t have to play along.

I told my boyfriend about this who was pretty horrified, and agreed that if I didn’t want to go I shouldn’t (although he still is because he’s friends with the groom). But my mum and stepdad think I would be the AH if I didn’t go. My mum said it’s also been obvious that Sophie was insecure (I never noticed this) and that she can understand where she’s coming from. She said I’ve had the spotlight our whole lives (again, I don’t think this is true! Sophie is far more outgoing and well liked than I have ever been) and even though it’s pretty sad, maybe she does deserve to be the princess on her wedding day and I shouldn’t hate her for it. She says I’ll regret missing the wedding over this. My stepdad says I should go because she’s my oldest friend and even if she is being unfair, sometimes you have to let people be irrational. I really don’t know now. Sophie and I have so many mutual friends there’s not a lot of people I can ask about this without it getting back to her, so here I am.

I feel like maybe I’m being a jerk having this blowup but I don’t see why I should even stay friends with someone who would exclude me from her wedding party over something superficial. And clearly she’s been sitting on these feelings forever. Not to mention I already paid for her whole bachelorette party and the bridesmaid dress and contributed to the cost of her wedding jewellery. And now I just feel used.

So am I being a petty AH by refusing to go?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Downvoted Commenter:** Your friend told you she didn't feel pretty enough to have you stood up next to her on her special wedding day. I was all for saying you weren't the asshole until you mentioned your mother. It's telling that your mum has been able to see how insecure Sophie and you haven't when she's meant to be YOUR friend. The fact your mum has pointed out that Sophie has always been insecure and tou, her best friend, haven't noticed that speaks a lot about your friendship.

The fact your response is that ""maybe"" your friend deserves to feel like a princess on her wedding day kinda seals it for me. YTA

> **OOP:** I meant “princess” like maybe she deserves to have her cake and eat it. And yes, it’s a maybe, because I’ve never thought getting married means you get to treat the people you love like crap.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Her decision shows she’s not actually your friend. Friends don’t actually care if you’re prettier than them.

And honestly. I think your BF sucks for still going. He should stand by you. His friend fiancé disrespected you. He should see they are a unit and realize you two are a unit. If one of them hurts you, it should hurt him.

Anyone who tells you to swallow disrespect cares more about their peace than your well being.

> **OOP:** Well, he said “should I also not go” and I was like “no let’s not become those people, it’s not a boycott”. If I didn’t want him to go he wouldn’t, but if he didn’t then Sophie’s brother would know why and then it would become a whole big thing. Plus then his sister who is also my friend would feel like she shouldn’t go and I just didn’t want to start the domino effect. Especially since I don’t even know if I intend to tell anyone why I’m not going

**OOP's response to a downvoted comment regarding the competition between herself and Sophie for attention**

> **OOP:** The “spotlight” she’s referring to is specifically male attention (and I guess looks based attention generally from people we meet). And yes, I’m aware of that but that’s not what I consider to be spotlight, or not the be all end all, anyway. Sure, I get approached more by men. But Sophie was always the one with more friends, better grades, the person teachers actually liked, she was in clubs and well known. I considered all that to even out or even swing in her favour, honestly.
> 
> But yeah, it’s true I never realised that the male /looks attention thing bothered her that much. But to be fair, mothers do pick up on things about your friendships when you’re younger that sometimes you don’t. Sophie never let on that this one thing bugged her to this extent.

+

> It’s true that I’ve always got more male attention/people commenting on my looks, I admit that. But in the grand scheme of life, I never felt like that was a big deal. Sophie dated often while my current boyfriend is my second ever relationship. She has always had more friends, been more popular, even better academically. It’s not like she’s come second to me in everything. Just in this one thing. So I guess I just figured it evened out, or even that she was “winning” out of the two of us.
> 
> The thing is, I probably would forgive her, if she ever bothered to apologise. But clearly she still thinks she’s in the right here.

**Commenter 3:** NTA. That's because you have been used. Wtf is wrong with your dad & stepmom? Sophie hurt you so deeply, and they tell you to take one ror the team. That is truly awful for them to expect you to do. Also, your boyfriend is still going to be in the wedding because the groom is his best friend? So, in essence, he's saying that it's okay for the groom's fiancee to devastate you, as long as he still gets to go.

You really need to find new friends and a new boyfriend. Unfortunately, it's not so easy getting new parents. You should really let your parents how horrible they made you feel by putting their interests over their own daughter's.

You are no longer in the wedding, so send Sophie a bill for the bachelorette party and the wedding jewelry. Let her know that because you are no longer the MOH, it is her new MOH's obligation to pay. If she refuses, take her to small claims court.

Don't go to the wedding. It will be so uncomfortable for you, and you won't enjoy a minute of it.

> **OOP:** My boyfriend is going because his whole family is going and I told him not to skip it on my account. Because if he also skips then it’ll become a big thing. I don’t want him to boycott in solidarity, I think that’s childish.

**OOP on if she is professionally more successful than Sophie?**

> **OOP:** No, not at all. I’ve inherited some savings, and my boyfriend takes care of our household expenses so I have more disposable income. But Sophie is far ahead of me professionally and is much more career minded.

**Commenter 4:** Hmm wow I wonder if your better financial situation is viewed by Sophie as an extension of something like your looks that you didnt have to ""work"" for. Although of course inherited moeny/relationship financial support absolutely shouldn't be thought about in those terms.

Your boyfriend is also Sophie's brother's best friend. Did you meet your boyfriend through Sophie's family? I wonder if she feels like your family and even her family all favor you (her mother, brother, aunt, cousin, groom) and the wedding was just another reminder.

> **OOP:** I guess I kind of met him through her family. Her brother and my bf did the same sport that’s how they knew each other. My stepbrother also competed in the same sport so I knew who he was anyway but they were in different categories. But yeah I guess I got talking to him and stayed in his orbit because of Sophie’s brother because they stayed friends all those years so he was kind of around.
> 
> Obviously it’s weird looking back on it now because you question how you remember things. I always felt like I was the annoying one, not in a mean way, but we’re the only two girls in the immediate family (she has a brother, I have all stepbrothers) and I was always the “difficult” one because I didn’t like trying new things or I just wasn’t as easy going. The boys always thought I was a bit of a stick in the mud.

**OOP explains more about her family's background with Sophie's family and friend group**

> **OOP:** Firstly, our families are close, as in, our mothers were/are close, and we were close. My mother was single for a while so I guess yeah, we did get more absorbed into her family because we went over there more rather than them all coming to us. Then she got with my stepdad and it was more equal because the boys would hang out all together although my stepbrothers are quite a bit younger. She wasn’t really close to my stepbrothers because of the age gap, and I wasn’t really close to her brother for most of my life. It was only when my now boyfriend and I were getting closer that I got a bit more absorbed into their friend group and now talk to her brother a lot more. I didn’t just “steal” her family or something. Same with her mum, I’m not close to her really, but she’s my mum’s best friend and I’m closer to my own mother than Sophie is to hers, hence how I got this info. I assumed she didn’t say the comment exactly like that because that’s not even how my mum relayed it to me, and my mother god bless her is lucky if she remembers even the general idea of what someone tells her. So it was Chinese whispers. And okay it’s an assumption that she wasn’t really harsh about how she said it because i don’t know her to be cruel. Maybe she is and I don’t know. So yeah okay that was an assumption, but it wasn’t a defence. However she said it wasn’t the right thing to say.
> 
> But as for the groom, idk maybe I’m just nuts but this man saying “she’s perfect” and literally meaning that I am “perfect” in his eyes seems like an insane comment. Why would he think that? Why would he say that in front of his fiancé and her brother and his own friend? He doesn’t even know me well enough to confidently hold that opinion. Like it would come out of nowhere.
> 
> But it seems kind of unfair to say it’s my fault I didn’t know how she felt. She did tell me about her insecurities, and I told her about mine, and we supported each other. She just never mentioned that they had anything to do with me.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/HCvUydCUOu): **October 29, 2025 (nearly three weeks later)**

Update - My friend didn’t want me as MOH because of my looks

So idk if anyone wanted an update but the situation has somewhat concluded now and I thought I would provide some closure.

Firstly, some digging was done by my boyfriend and myself, and we thinkkk we found the root(s) of the issue. 

A couple of months ago, my bf, Sophie’s brother, the groom, and Sophie were out for drinks. I remember this night, I had an event for another friend and couldn’t go. Over drinks, the groom apparently asked when my bf was going to propose to me, and my bf said “probably sometime next year”. Groom then made a comment to the effect of “why would you wait that long, she’s perfect”. 

Now, according to both my boyfriend and Sophie’s brother, Sophie was really mad about this because Groom waited several years to propose to her. She’s been bringing it up to him regularly since. Obviously we all assume he meant “perfect for you” not literally perfect, but Sophie appears to be taking it personally. 

The second thing is that my mother did a little gentle probing and it turns out that at the bridesmaid fitting, Sophie’s mum told Sophie that she should have chosen a dress that wasn’t going to make me look better than her (I don’t think she said it like that to Sophie this is just how she relayed it to my mum) and draw attention. 

According to Sophie’s mum, her aunt and cousin said the same thing and I guess one of ganged up on her about it. She also has been on Sophie about a pre wedding diet. So it seems like these two things got blown out of proportion and ended up in Sophie’s request that I not be MOH.

I ended up deciding not to speak to Sophie about any of this. She’s planning her wedding, she should enjoy this time, I don’t want to make this about me, or our friendship. And if I’m being totally honest, I was kind of done with the friendship after the initial conversation. I wanted to know the reasons for my own peace of mind but the truth is, nothing was going to change the fact that she took her feelings out on me, who only ever wanted to support her. None of these things came from me or had anything to do with me but she chose to take a wrecking ball to a 20 year friendship rather than confront the people who upset her. I can’t wrap my head around that and I’m not going to try going forward.

That being said, I decided to go to the wedding, as my boyfriend’s plus one essentially, just for closure to this entire mess. Now that I’ve calmed down, I really don’t feel any particular way about going. I’ll eat, I’ll drink, I’ll clap, and Sophie will just be the wife of my boyfriend’s friend from now on, I guess. I haven’t told anyone why I’m not MOH, I just said in the group chat that it was for “personal reasons” and everyone can speculate. Once the wedding is over, I’ll tell our mutual friends the truth and they can do with that info what they will.

Sophie has reached out since to talk, but I sent her a message telling her that I’ll be at the wedding as a guest and that I hope she enjoys this time in her life and wishing her the best and haven’t been replying to anything else. It’s surprised me how quickly I’ve reached the numbness of just not caring anymore, but that’s where I’m at. I genuinely wish her the best but I just have zero interest in being part of her life anymore. I just can’t see her or anything about our friendship the same way anymore.

So…that’s that. I don’t really know what else to include. If anyone has anything else to ask that I’ve missed, feel free to ask. Thank you to everyone who commented!

**Relevant Comments**

**Downvoted Commenter:** Please don’t tell your mutual friends the whole story. Why stir up more drama? Let the whole thing fade away and move on.

> **OOP:** Because they’re going to want to know why we’re not hanging out or close anymore. And I have no reason to lie to my friends.

**Commenter 1:** The fiancé could have realised his own mistake in delaying his proposal and is advising his friend not to do the same. Sophie may just be very emotional and stressed with the wedding so you’ve done the right thing by giving her space. I do wonder if she is also recognising that she overreacted and now wants to make amends before the wedding?

You know her best though after two decades of friendship. It’s really hard losing a friend over silly drama though, I’m sorry OP

> **OOP:** I had also known my boyfriend for over a decade before we got together. It’s not like we started from scratch, and we both went into it knowing we thought we were going to get married. So it’s not the same situation at all and I don’t think it’s at all relevant to Sophie’s relationship.
> 
> I know she is trying to salvage the friendship by reaching out. But it’s like all my feelings have evaporated. I don’t feel like there’s anything I want to say or share with her. She’s the kind of person who would take her issues out on Someone over something purely superficial. I don’t want to engage with that at all

**Commenter 2:** INFO: Your initial post ended with you saying that you had already paid for a bunch of stuff because you were MOH. Did she offer to reimburse you for that? Do you think she waited to drop you from MOH until after you spent the money? Good for you for looking out for yourself.

> I don’t think she dropped me when she did because of the money. I do believe it was a coincidence. And she would probably make a plan to pay me back if I bugged her about it but I paid for those things for someone I loved at the time. I don’t want to take away from her experience just because I can.

**OOP responds to a downvoted [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oj0945/update_my_friend_didnt_want_me_as_moh_because_of/nm7jt8p/) about not having to tell the truth to the friend group regarding Sophie asking her to step down from MOH and let Sophie have the wedding she wants**

> **OOP:** I did solve it. I did what she asked. I didn’t want to drop out, she dumped me. Why should I have to stop myself receiving support from and being honest with my friends because she chose to misdirect her anger?
> 
> Regardless of what she feels because of things that have never come from me, I have been a good friend to her. I don’t think she is better off without me but it doesn’t matter. But she wasn’t thinking of 20 years of friendship when she chose to make everything my fault, so clearly it didn’t mean that much to her either.

**OOP responds on Sophie's insecurities and life being better for Sophie without OOP in it, dropping the friendship between both of them**

> **OOP:** It’s not that I never noticed she has insecurities. Everybody has insecurities. I just never thought her insecurities were focused on me, in comparison. I don’t take my feelings out on other people and I’m not a punching bag for people to do the same to me. And mind you, all this stuff I found about? NONE of that is things she ever bothered to tell me, or explain to me. She never tried to let me in to what she was feeling, or gave me the chance to be understanding, she just presented it as like “sorry you’re just not good enough anymore” as if it was my fault. Again, I just don’t have anywhere to go from there. Someone who does that isn’t someone I want to share my life with. That’s not to do with my ego, that has to do with keeping my associations positive.

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Editor's note: the latest update is over a couple weeks old, and it has not been posted to the sub here**

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/u/RightNose8825/s/q6LRjgyIpX): **December 8, 2025 (1.5 months later)**

I tried posting this update elsewhere on reddit but between the rules and the moderation it wasn’t working and with everything else that’s been happening lately I don’t have the energy lol. So here it is for anyone that wants it in case it doesn’t get posted anywhere else.

Original posts on my profile.

So, a lot of people wanted an update post wedding and I didn’t really think I was going to do one because it was just a wedding, right? Ha. Wrong. Ish.

So key things:

\* Everyone in our families ended up figuring out the general reason for me not being in the wedding. I didn’t tell them. Sophie’s brother got it from her fiancé and I guess kind of hinted to their parents. I didn’t entertain any conversations about it and was travelling anyway so idk what happened there but I know third hand that there were conversations happening. Sophie stopped reaching out shortly after that happened.

\* My boyfriend and I got engaged while travelling. Very sudden, I have a placeholder ring because it was so unplanned we are still in the process of sorting out the real one lol. We only told our own parents and decided it would stay this way until after the wedding.

\* I did not go “all out” on my outfit for the wedding, sorry to disappoint some of you haha

All in all, the wedding was nice, smooth. I was sat at a table with my boyfriend and his family and two of my stepbrothers, and obviously didn’t get ready with the bridesmaids, so mercifully managed to avoid any awkward questions or mentions of the situation. Like I said, I’ve barely been home and a wedding isn’t the time to catch up with people so it was a very “normal” wedding experience. Small talk, food, etc. I got from the conversations I did have that people assumed I’d dropped out of being MOH because I was busy this time of year, which I am, and I didn’t correct anyone.

Everything was fine until the speeches, during which Sophie’s now husband, who I’ll call Nick for the purpose of the story, congratulated me and my boyfriend on our engagement. We are STILL wracking our brains to think how tf he found out. We only told our parents. I didn’t wear a ring to the wedding. All our siblings/friends were shocked. We were absolutely mortified, I think all the guests were as well. Sophie was clearly very upset. I won’t be so self absorbed to say it ruined the evening but i was definitely squirming for the rest of the time we were there. We didn’t make our exit immediately because that would have caused more drama but we left earlier than intended. Our parents don’t even know Nick so they wouldn’t have spilled the beans. We didn’t confront him because he was pretty tipsy by the time speeches came around and afterwards it just didn’t seem appropriate, and now they’re on their honeymoon. My bf is planning to bring it up with Nick when they get back, but he’s pretty angry that Nick did that and doesn’t think they’ll be hanging out going forward. I sent Sophie a DM expressing how sorry I was about what happened which she left on read. Which is fair. I honestly don’t know what the fuck is going on.

Our friends still don’t know the full story btw. I’m not really free to even meet up with people between now and the new year and I think I just want to give this all some breathing room and enjoy the holidays, so I won’t be in a hurry to tell them. Obviously they’re all pleased about the engagement and shocked about what happened. None of them have spoken to Sophie, since she’s away right now and I guess avoiding everyone.

So that’s that. Really not the update I thought I’d be giving or one I wanted. I’m pretty shell shocked right now tbh. This has all just got so much uglier than it ever needed to be. But idk if these two things are even related. Maybe they’re not. I’m still a bit creeped out that Nick managed to find out something literally only 5 people knew and we don’t know how.

And…yeah. I don’t know what else to say.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Waw that engagement announcement really came out of nowhere, what an awkward situation. The groom is dumb.

Anyway, nothing to feel guilty about and actually nothing to pursue here. Even though she will never not see it as you did it to steal her thunder. And you you have nothing to prove or to justify. 

Congratulations on the engagement! And for the ex-friend that’s another page turned in life. 

> **OOP:** It totally came out of nowhere. I guess we have to wait to find out how he found out. But my bf is now thinking he didn’t know, he just wanted to say it and happened to be right. We won’t know until they’re back from the honeymoon

**Commenter 2:** You might want to tell your friends your side of the story, or else Sophie and Nick might change the story and make you out to be the bad guy before you even get a word in.

> **OOP:** I don’t think Nick would care enough to say anything to my and Sophie’s mutual friends. From what I’ve heard he didn’t agree with her decision anyway. But I will tell them my side of the story when I next see them, if they believe a different version, I have my receipts should I need them, but if they believe I’d do something unkind without even getting my side, jury’s out on whether I’ll go chasing after them to set the record straight either. I don’t think they would though

Antartica Compound, Sublevel 3.

""Keith O'Donnell, head geneticist at the New Organism Vitality & Advancement genetics company. They want me logging from day one, so here’s day one.

The air down here smells like oil and rust. We’re beneath an abandoned NORAD-adjacent facility, built in the fifties, decommissioned in the eighties, and repurposed for NOVA Genetics in the nineties. Gotta love recycling.

What we’ve found—or what NOVA claims we’ve found—could be a major breakthrough in biochemistry. 

They call it Syberium — a viscous, violet liquid, drawn from the Chersky Range four years ago in Russia.

After examination, it yielded potential benefits for the subjects. Proceeding 14 tests, the conclusive answer is that Syberium acts as a growth accelerant and is extremely potent; as of now, only 20 CC is needed for complete growth. 

But...again, none of the subjects have made it out of the newborn stage,(sigh) all dying from rapid cellular decay.

I fear the Syberium itself is missing to endure the constant strain of duplicating molecules. We'd need a stabilizer of some sort.""

(Click)
04/10/1991 – Personal Tape 1

""They hired me four months ago. Since then I’ve lived in the compound. Food, objects, comforts — whatever I request appears at my door. No questions asked.

There are at least five other scientists here. We’re not alone, though it often feels like it.""


""Every two days we’re marched to a repurposed barracks for dinner. Rust creeps along the floor. Dead plants crumble in their pots. Appetite killer.

Tonight something unusual happened: the cameras and mics went dead for a heartbeat. In that gap Mark — our resident ‘conspiracy’ biologist — whispered about a program from the 80's called Overgrowth. He said this facility sits on it's bones. He continued talkinga bout it for a damn while, but while talking he bumped my foot with his and handing me a crumpled piece of paper under the table, I took it quietly and pretended to still listen to his blabbering.

Before he could finish, three guards rushed in and hauled him off, muffling his screams as he fought.""


04/22/1991 – Tape 5

""Syberium-DNA trials continue. We’ve stabilized fragments. But it still doesn't look good;(deep sigh) we've now done avian, oceanic, and terrestrial. None of them pass as newborn. But everybody knows stubbornness wins in the end.""


04/22/1991 - Personal Tape 2

""Every failure is logged, and shipped straight back to NOVA HQ. I wonder where they go? Incinerators? Freezers? A second lab? Never asked. Sometimes I wonder if we’re the only lab.""


""Also Mark hasn't come back, so guess what he said had some weight behind it.""


04/23/1991 - Tape 6
""Stabilized fragments. Still dying. I’m tired.”

04/29/1991 – Tape 7

""New orders. New material.

Apparently, a German drilling project uncovered microbial life in glacial pockets that could be useful to our project. NOVA doesn't know what it is, so they're sending me to harvest.""


04/30/1991 - Personal Tape 3

""The world’s gone quiet since the Berlin Wall fell. Wars ended, empires crumbled. But in the shadows, men like our mysterious CEO pick through the ruins looking for scraps of god.

(Chuckle)
And I’m the one stitching them back together.""

05/12/1991 – Tape 9

""Arrived at the McMurdo-adjacent outpost. White horizon in every direction. The sky feels too big here. The silence is too absolute... It's driving me crazy.""


""I saw a penguin get eaten by an orca.

Orcas scare me. Just like what we're about to do.""


""We descended into a canyon previously covered by ice.

The algae was right there. (Window tap tap) Dinoflagellates, frozen in glacial caves, alive after what seems to be millions of years. I took samples.""


""I tested it on a mouse's fibroblast cells. Cancer took them over. The algae repaired them. Whole again. As if the disease never existed. But in the process it fused itself with the cells.

From what I could gather, there is no adverse side effect to the now ""healthy cells"".""


(Hmm)""If the algae is compatible with the subjects DNA,  if Syberium and the algae work together. We won’t just bring them back. We’ll bring them back perfected.""

05/20/1991 – Personal Tape 4

""If this works, history rewrites itself. Not some Land Before Time fantasy. Not just cloning. Something more. Something beyond.

Antarctica, Lab Dome C.

""Day 22 with the algae culture. This stuff is patient, eternal.

The bioluminescence seems to be part of the ""healing"" process of the cells; it can't seem to be destroyed, and it repairs itself at every iteration of the elimination tests.""

(2 days later)
""After further testing, It's only weakness seems to be heat, but for it to do anything it has to be hitting close to 3000°C.""

06/07/1991 - Personal Tape 5

""I might receive a new sample of theropod for the next test; they told me it would be finally time to mix the two substances together while growing a living being.""


""I'm hearing voices, but I can't discern if it's in my head or the al...no, can't be; it's just the cold and nothingness. I won't let it get to me; I can't.""


06/15/1991 – Tape 17


""Test subject designation: S-42. Deinonychus embryo. First hybridization trial complete: algae + Syberium + Deinonychus DNA.

For the first time, the cells didn’t implode. Division held. Nuclei remained intact.

I’m not looking at soup anymore. I’m finally looking at life.""

(A few hours later)
""She hatched today. Size of a raven, talons like scalpels, eyes bright and alert. When I extended my gloved hand to the containment box she chirped — not hissed. Not snapped. Chirped.

I’ve handled rats, chimps, even one unlucky goat. None ever looked at me the way she did, tilting her head as if asking a question.""


""Her colour came after a few hours — black as a starless sky.

I’m calling her Nyx. Little shadow.""


06/22/1991 – Personal Tape 6

""Nyx follows me everywhere. She curls near my workstation like a cat, watching, listening, I actually ended up writing her name instead of her designation on the report, she's really gettin' to me.""

""Today I noticed her spine; there's subtle luminescence under the skin. A thin glowing line from neck to tail. Not constant, but pulsing when she eats or plays. The algae is expressing itself through her physiology. Surely a reaction of the bonding with the cells.""

06/23/1991 - Personal Tape 7

""NOVA wants results. They’ll get more than that. They’ll get monsters. Raptors aren’t supposed to be affectionate. But of course that's not what they want; they want carnival attractions with teeth. 
But hey... at least Nyx...she’s affectionate toward me.""

07/01/1991 – Tape 22

""New orders again. Transfer to a higher-capacity site, codename Excelsior. Location is classified even to us until departure.""

""They argued with me, of course. Said Nyx was too fragile for transport. I insisted. So I built her a crate with bedding. When the helicopter lifted, she shrieked until I put my hand on the box. Then she went quiet.""



""I don’t know what Excelsior is. But I know this: she’s coming with me. And I would burn this whole compound before leaving her behind.""

07/05/1991 – Tape 23

Colorado Compound, before departure.

""Dr. Brennan handed me an envelope with a number and three lines of code. In case containment fails, in case things go ‘beyond salvage.’ She always was a good one.""

07/12/1991 – Personal Tape 8

Site Excelsior

""We arrived. And this place…
(Scoff)
Imagine a military base fused with Disneyland’s underbelly. Tall fences, endless labs, hidden on red desert salt flats. The air smells of sodium and sulphur.""


""There are dozens of scientists. Geneticists, engineers, ex-military handlers. Some look pretty excited, some a little haunted.

Nyx hated the trip. Complained the whole way, she sleeps in my chamber now, curled right next to me. Like a watchdog.""

(August–October 1991)

08/01/1991 – Tape 28

""Goddamn thing....Excelsior’s projects dwarf mine. Three Utahraptors grown in parallel: Specimens U-1 through U-3. Thrice Nyx’s size, thrice her aggression.

They seem… synchronized. When one tilts it's head, the others follow. When one growls, the others echo. It's Not communication. Not mimicry. Something deeper. A hive-mind-like behaviour.

And then the hairs. They’re like structures on their skulls, similar to antennae. They vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies, resonating in their hollow nose chamber, generating a droning roar. Heavy. Mechanical. Like standing under a military helicopter motor.

NOVA calls it a ‘novel adaptation.’ I say it’s a warning.""

""Their genes are...weird; they mixed in the saltwater crocodile to give them reptile features, making them look like ""real"" dinosaurs. It also makes them hyper aggressive. They somehow put in cicada as well...explains why the droning is cranked to 11.""


""ALSO Dinosaurs had feathers, goddamn airheads.""


08/18/1991 – Tape 32

""Nyx is scared of the Utahraptors. She presses against me when their chambers hum with that awful sound. It resonates throughout the whole complex, vibrating metal and glass slightly.

They’re machines. Bred for amusement.

I fear them. Yet I pity them. But mostly—I hate what they represent.

Because if Nyx is my miracle, then the raptors are someone else’s monster.""


09/02/1991 – Tape 37

""The CEO visited today.

A man in a burgundy suit, decorated by a simple black tie with a gold inlaid DNA strand pattern. His face obscured by round sunglasses and lack of light. They never gave a name. Never spoke above a whisper. Only watched through glass as the Utahraptors were fed live prey.

The Raptors were extremely vocal the whole times the CEO was there except when he spoke, then they shut right up as if their vocal cords were cut.

When he left, every handler stood straighter. The strength of gravity itself seeming to shift.

Whoever he is, he doesn’t want amusement. He wants power. The ‘park’ is just a mask. I feel it.""


09/22/1991 - Personal Tape ø


""The CEO summoned me into his office, first time I’ve ever been up there. Felt like walking into a different world. Polished black marble instead of rust. Carpeting so thick my sneakers sank. And cold. Not air-conditioned cold — vacuum cold. Like standing in a server room with no servers.

The secretary, no badge, no name, she just nodded once and led me through a long corridor lit by violet strips in the floor. No sound except my own footsteps.”


“His office was…lovely. Massive bookshelves rising from floor to ceiling curling themselves like ribs to the entry doors, within the shelves an extreme adornment of books varied as the colors of the light spectrum.

A cherry mahogany desk, a single chair behind it, an exquisite couch to repose oneself, behind it all a wall of black marble exquisitely inlaid with gold accents representing the solar system adorned with thousands of stars.

He stood with his back to me, hands clasped behind him. Same suit, same inner fear. When his voice came it wasn't speaking. It was a whisper that felt like it landed directly in my inner ear. Like a demon making me surrender to his wicked whims.

‘Doctor O’Donnell,’ he said. ‘You’ve done well. The little one—Nyx—is proof of concept. Proof that Syberium and the algae can coexist without degradation.’”

(Pause)

“My mouth was dry. Like the desert we were stationed in.
The room was dark, very dark.

He then turned. I still couldn’t see his eyes; the sunglasses
completely masking his sockets.

He didn’t sit. He leaned closer. ‘We’ve waited long enough for men to catch up to their ideas,’ he whispered. ‘Now our ideas will grow men.’”

""He walked a few feet and pressed a button on the wall, a drink came out, a delicate marshmallow smelling espresso cup.

The smell was like Lsd... tickling the back of my amygdala, striking a complete fear response immediately replaced with pure benign pleasure.

The coffee then began to smell like the freshly buttered pancakes my mom used to make in the morning for me, then cinnamon buns like my grandmother's place.

The scent shifted every few seconds, until it returned to a soft fire licked marshmallow aroma, all those flavors seeping of nostalgia, the man then sipped the cup gently.

I noticed when his lips parted from the drink, his tongue was partly purple as though stained by a food.

He proceeded to sit down on the chair rolling it to the start of the desk, depositing his ceramic on a coaster.""

(paper shuffle)

“He slid a folder toward me. No logo. No title. Inside, a requisition order for primate embryos and human stem cell lines.

The bottom line read, simply: ‘Phase Two: Homo sapiens trials. Directive Immediate.’

I stammered something about protocol. Ethics committees. He laughed — no sound came out, just a low vibration in my eardrum.

Then he said: ‘You'll see the files. You know the potential. We’ve cured cancer. We’ve accelerated evolution. You think our species can wait?’

I didn't understand what he was talking about but...I couldn't say no to the boss.”

(Deep breath)

“I left with the folder under my arm. His whisper still in my skull.”


10/15/1991 – Personal Tape 9

""I remembered Mark today. That note — OVERLORD PASS OVER 557 — has been burning in my mind. Curiosity finally won.

I slipped into my manager's office after lights-out. Computer still running. Login screen waiting. I typed in OVERLORD… password 557.

It worked.

Whole directories opened like a vault. Dozens of projects, dates stretching back into the eighties. But one file was marked red. Project Overgrowth.""

(DRRRRR—static)
(Click)

""It was a human trial. Subject codename: HELIX.

Male, early forties. Terminal — stage four liver cancer. The file described him as ‘selected for expendability.’ Government phrasing for dying anyway.

They placed him in a sealed observation room with a faint NOVA logo on the door. Bed. Chair. Nothing else.

First injection: Syberium, direct to the neocortex, targeting ARHGAP11B — the gene linked to cortical expansion.

On paper it was simple: accelerate brain growth, heal the body. A miracle in a syringe.”

(Pause. Paper shuffle)
“But it didn’t heal. It rewrote.

By day 3 the cancer was gone, but the scans showed something worse.

The Syberium had threaded into every cell, photo-reactive, violet veins glowing under the skin.

His immune system didn’t just kill tumors — it killed everything, rebuilding tissue with a strange lattice, the chemical, binding itself to the host.

He didn’t speak anymore. He didn’t sleep. He sat awake, eyes open, as if listening to something outside human range.""


""Day four — the skull fractures began. His brain pushed against bone, swelling, cracking sutures and then resealing itself with every pulse.

Like the body couldn’t decide if it was healing or birthing something new. The glass walls shook from his screams.

When they resumed injections, the swelling receded, but his eyes stayed purple — and the room itself seemed darker around him, like the light bent away.”

(Silence. Deep breath)
""They noted psychological collapse. Recording transcript, day five:

‘42…42 is the answer…atoms tell me…they glow, like stars, endless, endless. You can’t contain it. It doesn’t belong to you…’

Then he lunged at the glass. Whispered through blood and cracks:

‘You cannot control what you do not understand. The old wrath will return. We have stolen the throne.’”

And then, in stamped red:
[PATIENT TERMINATED].

Signed with nothing but a DNA helix emblem. No names. No initials.""

I was just about to take a sip of the milk Ethan handed me when, out of nowhere, my phone started ringing. 

The caller said. “Don’t drink it. It’s been drugged” 

My hand trembled so hard that I nearly spilled the milk 

The voice on the other end sounded frantic. 

The caller said. “We only have half a minute to talk. so listen carefully. 

This is Melissa. I’m calling from tomorrow. Right now, I’m at your funeral. 

“At 3 AM. your husband is going to throw you off the balcony while you’re asleep. You’ll die from the fall” 

I froze, instinctively glancing at Ethan, who seemed so caring and gentle. I couldn’t believe what I heard. 

The voice on the other end continued, speaking slowly and clearly. 

She said. “If you don’t believe me, check his secret WhatsApp account. He’s been seeing another woman behind your back for a long time. 

“His whole plan is to set you up to die in an ‘accident‘ during this honeymoon. 

“Listen, if you want to live, don’t let your guard down. You have to find me before 3 AM. I’ll keep you safe.” 

Then the call abruptly cut off. 

I was totally baffled. Melissa was my best friend, and she was fast asleep in the next room. 

How could she have called me with something so bizarre? 

I tried calling back, but the number was invalid. 

Ethan came out of the kitchen, flashing me a warm smile as he nudged me. 

He said, “What’s wrong, babe? Hurry up and drink your milk before it gets cold.” 

Staring at Ethan’s gentle smile, I couldn’t shake off this uneasy feeling creeping up inside me. 

Even if I wanted to dismiss that call as a sick joke, I couldn’t ignore it. Not when my life was on the line. 

I made up some random excuse, set the milk aside, and headed to Melissa’s room, phone in hand. 

But when I confronted Melissa, she just shook her head and denied everything. 

“What are you even talking about? It’s pouring outside, and the signal’s dead. I couldn’t have called you even if I wanted to,” Melissa said.

Sure enough, when I checked my phone, I had zero bars. 

I was utterly bewildered: what was that phone call I’d just received? 

I heard that voice loud and clear. It was unmistakably Melissa. 

Could it really have been Melissa from the future calling me? 

Just replaying her words in my mind made my skin crawl. 

Ethan was busy in the kitchen, and his phone was just sitting there on the coffee table. 

Luckily, Ethan never bothered to lock his phone around me, so I unlocked it in no time.

When I saw the messages from the insurance agent on his WhatsApp, the hairs on my arms stood on end. 

Ethan had actually taken out an accidental death insurance policy on me just before our honeymoon. And he was listed as the sole beneficiary. 

I clutched my chest, my heart pounding out of control. I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a coincidence. 

But when I switched over to his secret WhatsApp account, the only contact listed there made my blood run cold. 

It was a contact with no name, just a girl’s profile pic. The chat was packed with her own private selfies and a flood of angry questions. 

She texted: \[When are you finally going to divorce her? 

\[Ethan, could you kill her? That way, you’d be mine forever.\] 

The more I scrolled, the more my hands trembled. 

Suddenly, a cold voice rang out behind me. 

Ethan asked, “Honey, what are you looking at?” 

I instinctively shook my head and hurriedly closed everything on the phone, trying to make it look untouched. 

I said, “It’s nothing, really. My phone just lost signal, so I wanted to check if yours was acting up too.” 

Ethan’s cold demeanor eased a bit, and he gave me a faint smile. 

He said, “That makes sense. It’s probably just the storm messing with the signal. It should be back to normal once the rain clears up tomorrow. 

“Don’t overthink it. Come on. Have some fruit, honey.” He brought over a plate of sliced fruit. 

I forced a smile, reaching for a piece of fruit, ready to eat it.

If Ethan really had been trying to kill me while I slept, then my not drinking the milk meant he definitely would have tried to drug me with something else. 

I checked the time. 

It was 11 PM. There were five hours to go until 3 AM. 

As long as I stayed close to Melissa until then, I should be safe. 

I managed a weak smile. 

I said, “Honey, my stomach doesn’t feel so good. I think I’ll skip the fruit tonight. I’ll sleep in Melissa’s room, okay?” 

“No way,” Ethan shot back. 

Ethan, who never said no to me before, was suddenly weirdly firm. 

I was stunned, totally at a loss for words. 

Just then, Melissa came out of her room, looking like she was about to watch a show. She said, “Are you two fighting? 

“Listen up, Ethan. Laura’s my bestie, and if you even think about messing with her, my fists will have something to say about it.” 

Melissa was a sports school grad, always loud and straightforward. 

Hearing her, I instantly felt a bit safer and quickly shot Melissa a desperate, secret look, hoping she’d pick up on my silent plea. 

Melissa got the message instantly and jumped in, saying I should sleep in her room with her. 

Ethan’s face darkened as he gave Melissa a look I couldn’t quite figure out, then glanced at me. He still wouldn’t back down. 

He insisted, “No way. Laura’s with me tonight. 

“We’re newlyweds. This is our honeymoon. Having you here as a third wheel is already pushing it.” 

Melissa never liked Ethan. She always thought he was sketchy. 

Since this honeymoon was happening abroad, she only came along because she was worried I might get into trouble. 

But after Ethan said that, Melissa had no choice but to back off.

1pyd48p,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1pyd48p/i_cant_get_rid_of_my_ex/,I can't get rid of my Ex!,"Okay so I've never written one of these before but I follow this subs YouTube channel and I'm hoping to get some advice on what you would do 😏

I (f34) am a recovering alcoholic, I feel like this will be relevant to explain (not justify) some of the horrible choices I've made. About four years ago I went through a messy break up. Things got physical one night and I moved me and my son out the next day and in with my mom. I fell deep into depression and started drinking even more. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD. So when I started getting bad... I got really bad. My already bad health got worse and I ended up hospitalized multiple times, having multiple major emergent surgeries. I was on bed rest for almost a solid year and a half. I continued drinking and got more and more depressed and lonely. I signed up for a couple of dating apps and eventually started talking to ""T.""

Now T is a very nice guy and we immediately started dating. I couldn't leave my house for the first few months of our relationship so I never met his family or friends. Everything I knew about him came directly from him, but at that point I was just so thankful that there was someone who seemed to want to spend time with me and stick with me through all the hospital stays that I didn't even really think about that. Eventually I was able to leave the house a bit more. He ALWAYS wanted to go do something, whether it was going out for dinner or just running errands. He told me his car was broken down, so I did all the driving. He constantly pushed for more than I could handle and still to this day credits himself for how good I am now. I slowly started to learn that the things he had told me weren't true. He didn't have a car, he was not a manager where he worked, he had a felony record. I was still drinking so I kind of just let all those red flags slide. I remember at the time knowing I had to get sober and that my goals would not align with his lifestyle. He knew I was an alcoholic but I hid my drinking so he thought I was sober at that time. I was drunk the day we met. Fast forward about five months and I got really drunk one night and very bluntly told him, he was a liar and our ideas of the future just do not align.... All true but I was horrible and mean about it. The next day he asked me if we could work on things and even tho I knew we weren't going to last, I felt guilty and said yes. So for the next couple of weeks I tried so hard to fall for him. Then I got a new job. The night I received my first paycheck, I drank so much I almost ended up back in the hospital. Within the week, I had gotten myself fired and fallen down so many times I was covered in bruises head to toe. My mom had a coming to Jesus talk with me and somehow managed to get through to me in my darkest moment. I quit drinking. I started going to meetings. I found a sponsor. T was seemingly by my side through it all. Three weeks after quitting drinking, T and I were in my car when his phone started ringing through the Bluetooth speaker and a girl's name popped up on the screen if my radio. I didn't want to assume and accuse but he definitely was weird. Answered the call but was all one word answers and hung up asap. That night I drop him off and he's distant. I go home and he calls me and admits he's been taking you that girl and he thinks she loves him more than I did. We break up. They last less than forty eight hours. I stay going to meetings. T insists that we should still be friends and I reluctantly agree. I'm also a recovering people pleaser and the guilt from when I was drinking had me incapable of or unwilling to set boundaries. Fast forward a month and it's Ts birthday. His mom bailed on their plans and he wasn't going to do anything. I invited him to eat dinner with us and made a cake. We ate and I took him home. Two hours later he's calling me yelling me his roommate pulled a gun on him (his roommate was a drug addict) and he took all his stuff and was going to sleep in a empty house a couple blocks away. It was the middle of winter. I told my mom what was going on and we end up going to get him. She gives him two weeks to stay in the heated garage (there's a couch and TV out there) and we both give him every lead we can on finding a place. He says no one is returning calls but after a while we were both sure he's not even contacting them. He's blowing all his money on weed and designer hats. The two weeks end but he still comes over to hang out fairly often and leaving to sleep who knows where. But Everytime there is bad weather my mom end up going to find him and let him crash in the garage.  That has slowly turned into him just assuming he's always welcome. It's been a constant cycle of me setting a boundary and then giving him ""one night"" that turns into multiple days a week. To be clear, I have told him many times he can't keep staying here and needs to figure something out. He says he knows and is trying but every ""plan"" he tells me about is all telling on other people that don't come through. It's gotten to the point where he just lets himself in, I'll wake up thinking I'm home alone and he's in my shower. He tried to climb into bed with me one time. He eats and drinks anything he wants without asking, makes snide remarks about what I'm watching and how he should get to pick, even though he wasn't invited in the first place.  It's infuriating. My mom and I are both over it but also don't feel right leaving him outside in the snow or rain. This has been going on for almost a year. Since getting sober, I found an awesome job, have fixed my credit and am in general just getting my life back on track. I'm about to buy a house. So I feel like this friendship has an expiration date, without it being my mom's house being a factor, I just know he's going to all but move himself in. I've tried to talk to him a thousand times but he doesn't seem to understand that I really value my space and this next step is just for me and my son. Not him. Most recently, it was Christmas and his family bailed on him again so he crashed in the garage. Nothing it of the ordinary. He leaves in the middle of the night to go to work. We have no plans to see each other lined up. At one point the next day, he texted me asking if I wanted to hang out and I said I was busy maybe later. Well later we had a fuse blow in the garage and no stores were open to replace it. I text him letting him know. We hang out in the garage, so no power or heat means that we're not doing that. At one in the morning I get a text asking me to unlock the door so he can make coffee. So I asked if he was here, he said yes. He had been in my garage for hours without saying anything. I said wtf you can't just show up like that and stay whenever you want, you didn't live here. He said he knows but also sees no problem with it. He left that night and I know he's aware that I was pissed, I said as much but yet he's still texting me everyday like nothing happened. I'm short with him and won't invite him over and he's smart enough not to ask... For now. But that's how this always goes, he crosses a boundary, I tell at him and he gives me space for a couple days just for it all to happen again. At this point he doesn't even feel like a friend, more like an obligation. So how do I break this cycle? I didn't want him to be hurt but he's not my responsibility and I'm sick of feeling used. 

Oh and I figured out that the roommate that pulled a gun was never supposed to be a roommate. He was a friend that T just pushed himself on and never left and I guess that's how he got him to finally leave.

He also tried to get a job where I work but didn't get it thankfully.

Is it wrong to just ghost him at this point?",1,1766984167.0,okstorytime,6,1.0,False

And if I’m being honest, life hasn’t been all it’s cracked up to be. I suffered the loss of many people. Most I thought I’d never recover from. I’ve lost friends, family, loved ones. Some still a phone call away, if I’m being quite honest with myself. Others are buried six feet beneath the ground. I’ve loved things that tried to kill me. Most of them were substances, but sometimes they were people. I mistook survival for affection and chaos for connection. I stayed too long in places that were shrinking me because at least they felt familiar. I’ve spent years hating the mirror. I’ve spent years hating food. I’ve spent years hating me. But never enough to do anything about it. Years convincing myself that I was the problem, that if I could just be smaller, quieter, easier, everything would hurt less.
And although life hasn’t always been kind, there have been things worth hanging around for. There were still puppy kisses and long hugs from my mom. There were new people, new faces, new friends. Most that will stand beside me at my wedding and graduations. Some as the bridesmaids and another the groom. There were beautiful views, first kisses, and love. There were new foods and places, and music. Really good music. There were late night drives for icecream and bellyaches from too much laughter. There were coffees made, hand written letters, and really juicy oranges. There were birthday candles I didn’t expect to blow out. And there was the last time I held a blade to my wrist. 
Maybe life does hurt sometimes. Sometimes more than it doesn’t. But the pain doesn’t last forever. It stops when I hear my sisters laugh, my favorite song, or seeing people smile. So I stay. Not because it never hurts, but because even on the worst days, there’s always something small that makes the staying feel a little more like living. ",1,1766984067.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I’ve always had mild ADHD traits, but \~2.5 years ago I was in a pretty bad car accident. I walked away without obvious injuries and felt “fine” at first, but over time my symptoms have gotten much worse.

Main issues now: time blindness/chronic lateness; overpromising (especially at work) then panicking to deliver; procrastination + trouble starting; starting projects and not finishing; getting pulled into “side quests” (cleaning/reorganizing/laundry) when I’m supposed to do one thing; bigger emotional swings; interrupting/impulsivity; and weird clumsiness/bumping into things at home.

The most damaging part is time estimation + overpromising. I truly believe tasks will take way less time than they do and I can do far more in a day than is realistic. Example: I thought packing for a trip would take 3 hours. Instead I cleaned, reorganized, did laundry, then packed… and I was FOUR hours late. At work I’ll tell my boss something will be done by X time, then I’m up until 4am to make it true. It’s exhausting and starting to affect my credibility.

I’m taking this seriously: I see a therapist + psychiatrist and I’m on medication. Head MRI after the accident was normal. I don’t drink; I do have coffee. Sleep is a problem because nights turn into “just one more thing,” so I usually get \~6–7 hours/night (sometimes less), even when I plan to go to bed early.

Not looking for diagnosis—looking for practical tools.

Questions:

	1.	If time blindness/overpromising is your main struggle, what helped most?

	2.	Any scripts/systems to stop overcommitting at work?

	3.	How do you prevent nighttime spirals (one small task becomes 2–3 hours)?

	4.	Anyone else worsen after an accident/major life event (even with normal imaging)—what helped you stabilize?

I am now 230lbs and lost almost 100lbs and from what everyone said.
I balanced three meals a day, my first and last meals being the heaviest and hardiest, full of protein and extra nutrient. I get on average 7-10 hours of sleep a day, and I worked out for 30 minutes to an hour a day, and the result had been phenomenal. I lost so much weight, and I haven’t been this confident in my life. I’m proud of what I’ve done and how far I’ve come. But for women who r struggling, don’t give up, this is coming from an athlete to no-lete. But I say now no matter what, try to get three good meals, whether it be soup, sandwiches, eggs n toast, or something, just let it be made from ur hands and good ole veggie, fruit, or something u can cook. That makes all the difference, don’t cut out what u hate but its all about counting, count the chips (check the back of the bag), count the granola bar, count the coffee with its sugar and cream, but don’t CUT. eat what makes u happy, and live life i did it in a year, but I didn’t give up what I loved. I compromised and told myself I don’t need a double Big Mac I need the Big Mac, same fill different sizes. It’s all about moderation. I just thought differently, I thought about size and how I didn’t need as big as portion but I drank a lot of water too, almost a litre or two a day too. Get a big water bottle. It’ll help trust me, drink it everyday.
Then get on YouTube, start with YouTube if u aren’t comfortable with the gym, tons of workout videos and types, LOOK AT TYPE, it will matter and u will figure out what u like more and what works for u. CARDIO, HIIT, strength, mobility, or flexibility, start somewhere. Start with 30 minutes, and go up from there. You will get a difference and go for 3-5 days a week of working out and build up, don’t push urself babes. It’ll suck start slow and go, don’t rush. It’s about building discipline not motivation. So start slow, but be happy with what u do. If u see a YouTuber u like doing something, try it and see if h like it, if not, move on and try a different YouTuber. All YouTubers aren’t a one size fit all, I found mine in Yoga with Adrienne and Kassandra, Chloe ting, Coraline Giovani and a few others. But focus on a specific few that u LOVE. Bcuz that makes all the difference.

Over the past few seasons, especially regarding character balance and the infamous tier lists, I have seen a lot of people wondering about the odd predicament of Storm's pick rate. Even since her notorious buffs in Season 1 made her a consistently viable character all the way to the present day in Season 5.5, Storm has had a comparably low pick rate from many other duelist characters, even ones who have been nerfed to hell and back or play completely different to their original forms. Many answers have been posed, such as her relatively lackluster design, odd class placement, or requiring team coordination; but I firmly believe in one fundamental disappointment as the key to Storm's relative obscurity:

**Storm's character design doesn't make you** ***FEEL*** **powerful.**

For reference, let's take a look at The Thing, a character I think succeeds in everything that Storm fails at IN TERMS OF CHARACTER DESIGN.

https://preview.redd.it/33y1y5swj2ag1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=58d4544c18775310543e6f59c820bedd7afe8918

When you get a KO with Stone Haymaker, that dopamine rush is made all the more powerful thanks to the work of the Rivals art team and whatever mythical batch of substances that was apparently slipped into the lead designer's coffee that day. Giving someone the Anthony Joshua vs. Jake Paul Special just makes you feel like a big bully - you hear the big impact of the hit and the bell ringing in your ears, you see their corpse ragdoll into the nearest car or rock or what have you, you hear the ""**THAT'S HOW WE DO IT ON YANCY STREET!**"" It. Feels. Great.

Now, for those of you who are able; I want you to boot up Rivals, go into the practice range, and get a KO with the Bolt Rush ability on Storm (the secondary fire, for those uninitiated). This is Storm's equivalent of the Stone Haymaker: a powerful secondary fire that packs a considerable punch, with the added bonus of being a hitscan attack that pierces (it took me four months to learn that last little tidbit. Cue the ""The More You Know"" graphic.)

It is unfathomably pathetic. The only noise you really hear on the base skin is this little charge-up thing that happens when she's holding her hands up, and the animation just feels like Ro's clapping her hands with a bit more force than normal. This is Storm summoning an entire lighting bolt to shock whichever idiot decided to piss her off that day, and it feels no more impactful than one of Hawkeye's explosive arrows that nobody decides to use 90% of the time.

And this is generally the theme of most of Ororo's kit, from the Wind Blade's wimpy little whistling noises to the nonexistent ambience of the Goddess Boost. The only part of her kit that ever makes you feel like a true Omega-level mutant is the ultimate, because turning into a hurricane and wreaking havoc on the backline will never not feel awesome.

So here are the top 3 things I want for Storm's potential design update:

[Source: X-Men 97 S1 EP 8 \\""Tolerance Is Extinction\\"" \(When is she getting this skin btw??? NetEase get on this\)](https://preview.redd.it/er5swm2an2ag1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=196041c21e3c7bb65832c869ab81247a6aa5b63f)

1: **Storm needs to be loud as f\*\*k.**

The biggest contributor to the success of the Stone Haymaker's hype is that BELL, man. Every sound effect that Storm has should be turned up or re-recorded. Especially on the Goddess Boost ability, I want to hear the wind whistling and the thunder roaring 24/7. That Bolt Rush ability? Give it more impact noise. The Goddess Boost activation where you summon a bunch of lightning bolts? Add a bunch of thunder and lightning crackles when you activate/hit with it. And please, I beg of you, give the primary fire more than that little whistle thing it does right now.

2: **Abilities need new animations.**

This one would be more time-intensive to implement, but a lot of Storm's attack animations feel very nothing-burger right now. Let Storm put her entire body into some of these attacks, let the animation summon more lightning or wind visuals, etc. Biggest offender of this is the Goddess Boost ability. That is just Storm raising her hands up or waving downward. No work was done there.

3: **More weather effects!**

I briefly touched upon this in the last critique, but I feel like there's just not enough weather imagery in the moveset in general. Sure, there's some good stuff being done with the empowered Tornado mode, but that's such a lackluster form of CC that I've never had it do anything substantial in my games. (Pause for people in the comments to ask what rank I am.)

I understand that this update is in *no way* the top priority that NetEase should be working on right now, but I think even just doing something like making the Goddess Boost have a rolling thunder in the background or having the Bolt Rush have more lightning effects would do wonders for Storm's current ambience issues. Heck, maybe that would even be enough to shut up the ""just rework Storm to be a strategist"" crowd. (That's a lie. They will never stop.)

Let me know your thoughts on this idea, or whether or not you think any other characters deserve more love in terms of aesthetic \*looks meaningfully at Phoenix\*.",14,1766983902.0,marvelrivals,1,0.85,False

The threading on my adjustment dial ring got stuck during re-assembling and it has been stuck and i cant turn it clockwise/anti-clockwise.

It would mean a lot to me if you guys have an advice regarding to this, as I really do look forward to brew more amazing coffee using this grinder.

I was just about to take a sip of the milk Ethan handed me when, out of nowhere, my phone started ringing. 

The caller said. “Don’t drink it. It’s been drugged” 

My hand trembled so hard that I nearly spilled the milk 

The voice on the other end sounded frantic. 

The caller said. “We only have half a minute to talk. so listen carefully. 

This is Melissa. I’m calling from tomorrow. Right now, I’m at your funeral. 

“At 3 AM. your husband is going to throw you off the balcony while you’re asleep. You’ll die from the fall” 

I froze, instinctively glancing at Ethan, who seemed so caring and gentle. I couldn’t believe what I heard. 

The voice on the other end continued, speaking slowly and clearly. 

She said. “If you don’t believe me, check his secret WhatsApp account. He’s been seeing another woman behind your back for a long time. 

“His whole plan is to set you up to die in an ‘accident‘ during this honeymoon. 

“Listen, if you want to live, don’t let your guard down. You have to find me before 3 AM. I’ll keep you safe.” 

Then the call abruptly cut off. 

I was totally baffled. Melissa was my best friend, and she was fast asleep in the next room. 

How could she have called me with something so bizarre? 

I tried calling back, but the number was invalid. 

Ethan came out of the kitchen, flashing me a warm smile as he nudged me. 

He said, “What’s wrong, babe? Hurry up and drink your milk before it gets cold.” 

Staring at Ethan’s gentle smile, I couldn’t shake off this uneasy feeling creeping up inside me. 

Even if I wanted to dismiss that call as a sick joke, I couldn’t ignore it. Not when my life was on the line. 

I made up some random excuse, set the milk aside, and headed to Melissa’s room, phone in hand. 

But when I confronted Melissa, she just shook her head and denied everything. 

“What are you even talking about? It’s pouring outside, and the signal’s dead. I couldn’t have called you even if I wanted to,” Melissa said.

I heard that voice loud and clear. It was unmistakably Melissa. 

Could it really have been Melissa from the future calling me? 

Just replaying her words in my mind made my skin crawl. 

Ethan was busy in the kitchen, and his phone was just sitting there on the coffee table. 

Luckily, Ethan never bothered to lock his phone around me, so I unlocked it in no time.

When I saw the messages from the insurance agent on his WhatsApp, the hairs on my arms stood on end. 

Ethan had actually taken out an accidental death insurance policy on me just before our honeymoon. And he was listed as the sole beneficiary. 

I clutched my chest, my heart pounding out of control. I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a coincidence. 

But when I switched over to his secret WhatsApp account, the only contact listed there made my blood run cold. 

It was a contact with no name, just a girl’s profile pic. The chat was packed with her own private selfies and a flood of angry questions. 

She texted: \[When are you finally going to divorce her? 

\[Ethan, could you kill her? That way, you’d be mine forever.\] 

The more I scrolled, the more my hands trembled. 

Suddenly, a cold voice rang out behind me. 

Ethan asked, “Honey, what are you looking at?” 

I instinctively shook my head and hurriedly closed everything on the phone, trying to make it look untouched. 

I said, “It’s nothing, really. My phone just lost signal, so I wanted to check if yours was acting up too.” 

Ethan’s cold demeanor eased a bit, and he gave me a faint smile. 

He said, “That makes sense. It’s probably just the storm messing with the signal. It should be back to normal once the rain clears up tomorrow. 

“Don’t overthink it. Come on. Have some fruit, honey.” He brought over a plate of sliced fruit. 

I forced a smile, reaching for a piece of fruit, ready to eat it.

If Ethan really had been trying to kill me while I slept, then my not drinking the milk meant he definitely would have tried to drug me with something else. 

I checked the time. 

It was 11 PM. There were five hours to go until 3 AM. 

As long as I stayed close to Melissa until then, I should be safe. 

I managed a weak smile. 

I said, “Honey, my stomach doesn’t feel so good. I think I’ll skip the fruit tonight. I’ll sleep in Melissa’s room, okay?” 

“No way,” Ethan shot back. 

Ethan, who never said no to me before, was suddenly weirdly firm. 

I was stunned, totally at a loss for words. 

Just then, Melissa came out of her room, looking like she was about to watch a show. She said, “Are you two fighting? 

“Listen up, Ethan. Laura’s my bestie, and if you even think about messing with her, my fists will have something to say about it.”

I belong to a social group that meets monthly at people's houses. I've never hosted because the numbers can be anything from 4 to 20 people and I don't have  enough lounge space if 20 people turn up.

I have 2x 2-seater couches, a single armchair, and 2 office chairs. No dining chairs as we don't have space for a dining table. No bar stools as we don't have a breakfast bar. We sit on the couch for everything. No kids.

Part of me feels bad for never hosting, but the practical part of me says it's gonna be tricky when I can only seat 7 people and offer coffee to 8 (only have 6 mugs and a couple of keep cups).

My parents have 30 mugs in the cupboard, and seats for 25+ people between their couches, indoor dining set, outdoor dining set, camping chairs, bar stools, decorative armchairs etc.

Maybe different but remember

Winters warm where you and I

Kissing whiskey by the fire

With the snow outside

And the summer comes

In the river swims at midnight

Shiver cold, touch the bottom

You and I with muddy toes

Stay or leave

I want you not to go

But you should

It was good as good goes

Stay or leave

I want you not to go

But you did

Wake up naked drinking coffee

Making plans to change the world

While the world is changing us

It was good, good love

You used to laugh under the covers

Maybe not so often now

The way I used to laugh with you

Was loud and hard

Stay or leave

I want you not to go

But you should

It was good as good goes

Stay or leave

I want you not to go

But you did

So what to do with the rest of today's afternoon?

Hey, isn't it strange how we change everything we did?

Did I do all that I should?

That I coulda done

Remember we used to dance

And everyone wanted to be you and me

I want to be too

What day is this?

Besides the day you left me

What day is this?

Besides the day you went

So what to do with the rest of the day's afternoon?

Hey, isn't it strange how we change everything we did?

1pycsy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1pycsy7/physical_dominance_how_to_use_body_language_to/,Physical Dominance: How To Use Body Language To Command Respect,"# **Physical Dominance: How To Use Body Language To Command RESPECT (Science-Based Guide)**

Look, nobody teaches you this stuff. We grow up thinking respect comes from credentials, titles, or being the loudest person in the room. But here's what years of research shows: respect starts way before you even open your mouth. Your body is broadcasting messages every second, and most people are screaming ""don't take me seriously"" without realizing it.

I spent months going through research papers, behavioral psychology books, and studying everyone from FBI negotiators to alpha CEOs. The pattern is clear. Body language isn't some woo-woo concept. It's biology, neuroscience, and raw human psychology working together. And once you understand how it works, you can literally reprogram how people perceive and respond to you.

## 1. Stop Apologizing With Your Posture

Your spine is your power cable. When you slouch, you're not just looking weak, you're literally changing your brain chemistry. Research from Harvard shows that holding expansive postures for just two minutes increases testosterone (dominance hormone) by 20% and decreases cortisol (stress hormone) by 25%. Meanwhile, contracted postures do the opposite.

**The fix:** Stand like someone just attached puppet strings to the top of your head, pulling you upward. Shoulders back, chest open, chin parallel to the ground. Not puffed up like you're trying too hard, just neutral and grounded. Practice this against a wall for 5 minutes daily until it becomes automatic.

Walk into rooms like you own the building. Not arrogant, just confident. People can smell uncertainty from across the room. Your body needs to say ""I belong here"" before your mouth says anything.

## 2. Master the Eye Contact Game

This is where most people fuck up completely. They either stare like psychopaths or avoid eye contact like scared rabbits. Both kill your credibility instantly.

The research is clear: confident people maintain eye contact 70-80% of the time during conversations. Here's the rule: when listening, hold steady eye contact. When speaking, you can break away occasionally to think, but always return to their eyes. This signals you're engaged but not desperate for validation.

**Advanced move:** The ""triangle technique"" used by interrogators. Your gaze moves slowly between their eyes and mouth, forming an invisible triangle. It's engaged but not aggressive. Practice this during low-stakes conversations first, like ordering coffee or chatting with coworkers.

**What Everybody is Saying** by Joe Navarro (former FBI counterintelligence agent, 25+ years of experience) breaks down exactly how body language reveals hidden thoughts and emotions. This book is insanely good. It's based on actual field work, not theory. Navarro explains how to read people and project confidence through nonverbal cues. Best body language book I've ever read, hands down. This will make you question everything you thought you knew about human interaction.

## 3. Control Your Space Like Territory

Confident people take up space. Insecure people shrink. It's that simple. When you sit, don't cross your arms or legs tightly. Spread out naturally. Put your arm on the back of the chair next to you. Plant your feet firmly on the ground, shoulder width apart.

This isn't about being an asshole who takes up three seats on the subway. It's about claiming your legitimate space without apology. Your body should signal ""I'm comfortable existing here.""

**In meetings:** Don't lean back like you're bored or lean forward like you're begging for approval. Sit upright, slightly reclined, hands visible on the table or armrests. This posture says ""I'm relaxed because I'm confident.""

**Standing conversations:** Face people directly, feet planted. Don't shift weight back and forth or fidget. Root yourself like a tree. People unconsciously perceive stillness as strength.

## 4. Slow Down Everything

Nervous people move fast. They talk fast, walk fast, gesture frantically. It screams anxiety. Confident people move deliberately because they're not rushing to prove anything.

**Walk slower.** Cut your normal pace by 15%. Each step should be purposeful, not hurried. This single change makes you appear more authoritative immediately.

**Talk slower.** Pause between thoughts. Let silence exist. Most people are terrified of silence and rush to fill it with verbal diarrhea. Confident people use pauses for emphasis and to let their words land. Watch Obama speak. The man uses pauses like a conductor uses rests in music.

**Gesture slower.** When you move your hands, make it count. Big, controlled movements beat small, jittery ones. Think of how martial artists move, smooth and intentional.

## 5. Master the Handshake and Touch

Your handshake is a 3 second job interview. Research shows people form lasting impressions from handshakes alone. Here's the formula: firm (not crushing), full palm contact, two to three pumps, maintain eye contact the entire time, slight smile.

The ""dead fish"" handshake murders your credibility. The ""bone crusher"" makes you look insecure and trying too hard. Practice until you nail the Goldilocks zone.

**Strategic touch:** Light, appropriate touch (shoulder tap, arm touch during conversation) releases oxytocin and builds rapport. But this is advanced level stuff. Done wrong, it's creepy. Done right, it makes people trust and like you more. Start with handshakes and high fives until you develop social calibration.

## 6. Vocal Tonality Is Body Language

Your voice is part of your physical presence. Deep, resonant voices command more respect than high, squeaky ones. This isn't about what you say but how you say it.

**Lower your pitch naturally:** Speak from your chest, not your throat. Imagine your voice coming from your sternum. Record yourself and listen back. Most people are shocked by how high-pitched they sound.

**Reduce uptalk:** Stop ending statements like questions. That rising inflection at the end of sentences makes everything sound uncertain. Make statements land with a downward inflection.

Try the **Finch app** for daily habit tracking and confidence building exercises. It gamifies self improvement with a cute bird companion that grows as you complete tasks. Sounds dumb, but it actually works for building consistency with new behaviors like posture correction and vocal exercises. Plus it has mental health check ins that help you track progress.

## 7. The Power of Stillness

Fidgeting, touching your face, playing with your phone, tapping your foot, all of it broadcasts nervousness. Research in kinesics (study of body movement) shows that status correlates directly with stillness. High status people are economical with movement.

**Practice this:** Sit completely still for 5 minutes. No adjusting, no scratching, no shifting. Just breathe and be present. It's harder than it sounds. Your body wants to discharge nervous energy through movement. Train yourself to absorb that energy instead.

In conversations, resist the urge to constantly nod or give verbal affirmations like ""uh huh"" every two seconds. Be present, listen, but don't perform listening. Stillness signals you're secure enough to just exist without constant validation seeking.

## 8. Strategic Symmetry and Mirroring

This is ninja level stuff. Subtly matching someone's body language creates unconscious rapport. If they lean in, you lean in (after a delay). If they cross their legs, you do the same (not immediately, that's weird). This technique, called mirroring, activates mirror neurons in the brain and makes people feel connected to you.

But here's the key: do it naturally and with about 20% of their movements. Full on mimicry looks creepy. Partial mirroring feels natural.

**Charisma Myth** by Olivia Fox Cabane (executive coach for Fortune 500 CEOs, Stanford instructor) is the ultimate guide to developing magnetic presence. She breaks down charisma into learnable behaviors, including body language, vocal tonality, and presence. The book combines neuroscience with practical exercises. I finished this in two days because I couldn't put it down. Best investment for anyone wanting to command rooms and build genuine influence.

**BeFreed** is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google AI experts. You tell it what you want to work on, like improving confidence or mastering body language, and it pulls from verified books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom audio learning plans. You can adjust the length from quick 15-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The app includes both books mentioned above plus hundreds more on communication and presence. What makes it different is the adaptive learning system that evolves based on your specific challenges and creates structured plans around your goals.

## 9. Enter Rooms Like You Own Them

Never hesitate at doorways or entrances. That split second of uncertainty tells everyone you're not sure if you belong. Walk in with purpose, scan the room once (not nervously darting your eyes), then move to where you want to be.

**The power pause:** When you enter a room, especially for presentations or meetings, pause for two seconds before speaking. Let people notice you. This builds anticipation and frames you as someone worth paying attention to.

Remove ""permission seeking"" behaviors like knocking timidly, apologizing for entering, or saying ""sorry to interrupt."" Just enter, acknowledge people if appropriate, and proceed with your purpose.

## 10. Facial Expressions Matter More Than You Think

Your resting face broadcasts your internal state. If your default expression is anxious, tired, or annoyed, people respond accordingly.

**Practice neutral confidence:** Slight upturn at the corners of your mouth (not a full smile, just not frowning), relaxed forehead, soft but direct eye focus. This signals approachability combined with strength.

**Kill the nervous smile:** Stop smiling when you're uncomfortable or during serious conversations where it's inappropriate. Nervous smiling destroys authority. Save genuine smiles for moments that actually warrant them.

Record yourself on video during practice conversations. You'll be shocked at the weird shit your face does that you're completely unaware of.

---

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: your body language right now is the result of years of conditioning, trauma, insecurity, and social programming. Changing it isn't a weekend project. It takes consistent, deliberate practice until these behaviors become automatic.

But here's the good news: unlike changing your face or height, body language is 100% under your control. You can literally reprogram how people perceive you starting today. The research is clear, the techniques work, and the only thing standing between you and commanding genuine respect is consistent action.

Start with one thing. Just one. Master your posture this week. Next week, add eye contact. Build from there. Your future self, the one who walks into rooms and people actually shut up and listen, is already inside you. You just need to let your body express it.",2,1766983234.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

She said. “If you don’t believe me, check his secret WhatsApp account. He’s been seeing another woman behind your back for a long time. 

“His whole plan is to set you up to die in an ‘accident‘ during this honeymoon. 

“Listen, if you want to live, don’t let your guard down. You have to find me before 3 AM. I’ll keep you safe.” 

Then the call abruptly cut off. 

I was totally baffled. Melissa was my best friend, and she was fast asleep in the next room. 

How could she have called me with something so bizarre? 

I tried calling back, but the number was invalid. 

Ethan came out of the kitchen, flashing me a warm smile as he nudged me. 

He said, “What’s wrong, babe? Hurry up and drink your milk before it gets cold.” 

Staring at Ethan’s gentle smile, I couldn’t shake off this uneasy feeling creeping up inside me. 

Even if I wanted to dismiss that call as a sick joke, I couldn’t ignore it. Not when my life was on the line. 

I made up some random excuse, set the milk aside, and headed to Melissa’s room, phone in hand. 

But when I confronted Melissa, she just shook her head and denied everything. 

“What are you even talking about? It’s pouring outside, and the signal’s dead. I couldn’t have called you even if I wanted to,” Melissa said.

Chapter 1 

Sure enough, when I checked my phone, I had zero bars. 

I was utterly bewildered: what was that phone call I’d just received? 

I heard that voice loud and clear. It was unmistakably Melissa. 

Could it really have been Melissa from the future calling me? 

Just replaying her words in my mind made my skin crawl. 

Ethan was busy in the kitchen, and his phone was just sitting there on the coffee table. 

Luckily, Ethan never bothered to lock his phone around me, so I unlocked it in no time.

When I saw the messages from the insurance agent on his WhatsApp, the hairs on my arms stood on end. 

Ethan had actually taken out an accidental death insurance policy on me just before our honeymoon. And he was listed as the sole beneficiary. 

I clutched my chest, my heart pounding out of control. I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a coincidence. 

But when I switched over to his secret WhatsApp account, the only contact listed there made my blood run cold. 

It was a contact with no name, just a girl’s profile pic. The chat was packed with her own private selfies and a flood of angry questions. 

She texted: \[When are you finally going to divorce her? 

\[Ethan, could you kill her? That way, you’d be mine forever.\] 

The more I scrolled, the more my hands trembled. 

Suddenly, a cold voice rang out behind me. 

Ethan asked, “Honey, what are you looking at?” 

I instinctively shook my head and hurriedly closed everything on the phone, trying to make it look untouched. 

I said, “It’s nothing, really. My phone just lost signal, so I wanted to check if yours was acting up too.” 

Ethan’s cold demeanor eased a bit, and he gave me a faint smile. 

He said, “That makes sense. It’s probably just the storm messing with the signal. It should be back to normal once the rain clears up tomorrow. 

“Don’t overthink it. Come on. Have some fruit, honey.” He brought over a plate of sliced fruit. 

I forced a smile, reaching for a piece of fruit, ready to eat it.

But I stopped myself and set it back down. 

Looking back now, that phone call was most likely real.

If Ethan really had been trying to kill me while I slept, then my not drinking the milk meant he definitely would have tried to drug me with something else. 

I checked the time. 

It was 11 PM. There were five hours to go until 3 AM. 

As long as I stayed close to Melissa until then, I should be safe. 

I managed a weak smile. 

I said, “Honey, my stomach doesn’t feel so good. I think I’ll skip the fruit tonight. I’ll sleep in Melissa’s room, okay?” 

“No way,” Ethan shot back. 

Ethan, who never said no to me before, was suddenly weirdly firm. 

I was stunned, totally at a loss for words. 

Just then, Melissa came out of her room, looking like she was about to watch a show. She said, “Are you two fighting? 

“Listen up, Ethan. Laura’s my bestie, and if you even think about messing with her, my fists will have something to say about it.” 

Melissa was a sports school grad, always loud and straightforward. 

Hearing her, I instantly felt a bit safer and quickly shot Melissa a desperate, secret look, hoping she’d pick up on my silent plea. 

Melissa got the message instantly and jumped in, saying I should sleep in her room with her. 

Ethan’s face darkened as he gave Melissa a look I couldn’t quite figure out, then glanced at me. He still wouldn’t back down. 

He insisted, “No way. Laura’s with me tonight. 

“We’re newlyweds. This is our honeymoon. Having you here as a third wheel is already pushing it.” 

Melissa never liked Ethan. She always thought he was sketchy. 

Since this honeymoon was happening abroad, she only came along because she was worried I might get into trouble. 

But after Ethan said that, Melissa had no choice but to back off.

1pycoas,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAdmissionsPH/comments/1pycoas/my_experience_working_with_kingston_international/,My Experience Working With Kingston International College Singapore and Apex Company,"My Experience Working With Kingston International College Singapore and Apex Company

This post is about Kingston International College (Singapore) and the recruitment and operations company Apex that works with and promotes its programs.

I worked for Apex remotely in a consultant and operations role, directly involved in recruiting, student communication, payments, and internal processes related to Kingston International College programs.

1) Work Conditions at Apex

I regularly worked 10–12 hours per day, 5.5 days a week, often starting earlier than scheduled and staying late due to constant pressure and unrealistic expectations.
Overtime was enforced but never paid.

There was no proper employment structure. No official contract, no legal protections, and no transparency around pay calculations.

The work environment was extremely toxic. Being shouted at, pressured, blamed, and publicly scolded was normal. Management relied heavily on fear, guilt, and constant urgency to push people to work longer hours. Taking any kind of break was looked down on, for example; going to the toilet for over 5 minutes, getting coffee, or not working extra on the 1 day off.

After resignation, earned commissions were withheld, despite being completed and tracked while employed. The only explanation given was that employment had ended.

2) Verbal Abuse and Intimidation

Verbal abuse from management was frequent and normalized.

I was:
	•	Called stupid, useless, and incompetent
	•	Spoken to in a degrading and aggressive manner during calls
	•	Subjected to intimidation, including statements involving threats toward my family
	•	Publicly humiliated as a way to apply pressure

There was no HR, no reporting system, and no accountability. This behavior was tolerated internally and treated as normal.

This environment had a serious impact on my mental health and was a major reason for leaving.

3) The Reality of Kingston International College Programs

This is the part potential students need to read carefully.

Internship Pay Is Misrepresented

Students are often told internships pay around 900 SGD.
In reality, many receive only 400 SGD per month.

The remaining amount is taken by intermediaries or classified as fees, without this being clearly explained upfront.

Students are expected to live in Singapore, one of the most expensive cities in Asia, on 400 SGD, often without proper warning.

Internship placements are frequently low skill service or retail roles, including cafés, convenience stores, or similar positions. This is not transparently disclosed during recruitment.

4) Diplomas and Education Value

The diplomas offered through Kingston International College are private diplomas with limited recognition.

There are no guaranteed outcomes, despite how the programs are marketed. Many of the skills taught can be learned independently or through far cheaper alternatives.

5) Bali Programs

The Bali programs promoted by Apex are extremely overpriced for what they offer.

Participants are effectively doing the same work as staff, under long hours and pressure, while paying to participate. The “training” aspect is overstated, and participants are treated more like unpaid labor than students.

6) Final Warning

This post is based on direct firsthand experience working inside Apex and dealing with Kingston International College programs.

If you are considering:
	•	working for Apex
	•	enrolling in a Kingston International College programs
	•	joining their Bali programs

Ask for everything in writing, including:
	•	net pay after deductions
	•	internship job type and location
	•	diploma recognition
	•	legal protections
	•	refund and exit terms

This has become a fun hobby that has resulted in weekend rituals, conversations, and sharing my creations with friends over breakfast. With so many devices and tools out there I truly do think this is a fun way to be creative and to make something you can be proud of. 

The Ratio Six is the newest addition to the lineup. Still working on the recipe I like for it. Any suggestions are welcomed!

Looking forward to a new espresso machine in the new year. The Hibrew H10a has been a fun machine to learn on, but after a little more interest in the hobby an upgrade will be a welcomed sight. This was my first piece of equipment I bought. Been using this machine for nearly 2 years. With bi-monthly deep cleaning this still runs exceptionally well. 

After a little trial and error the Encore ESP Pro has been a nice addition for those mornings on the go when I dont want to mess with the K6 grinder which makes very nice espresso.

I moved from using 38mm GravelKing SK's with TPU tubes to 30mm P Zero Race tires.  
I never had a flat with the SK's but I'm doing more group rides this winter and less light gravel rides, and wanted a speed boost.

My First ride was 20 miles and fine, but got a pinch flat as soon as i hit my drive way.  
my drive way is a moderate incline certainly not flat, and a mild transition from the road.

At first i thought it was because i reused my TPU from my 38mm tire, so i used my spare (also 38mm tpu) and it did the same thing immediately hitting my drive way. ( snake bit 2 sharp holes)  
This was confusing for me because i did go over speedbumps and roll off a curb at my coffee shop on my route without issue. But my drive way apparently hates the combo.

I'm using Butyl in the rear for now, the front tire has held up, but have ordered TPU in the right size to try it again.

I'm running 85psi in the rear and 78 in the front.

Is there a to installing them wrong, should i just know i need to unweight or dismount prior to my drive way? (nothing real sharp just a slight lip before the transition from road to driveway).",1,1766982793.0,cycling,10,1.0,False

I love him and he is a great and very loyal boyfriend who respects and loves me infinitely more than I deserve. I’m homeschooled and my friends go to public school along with my bf (they knew him first and I met him through them bc they go to my church), and they all know each other really well bc they all go to the same events for school, which I think is a green flag bc my friends think my bf is a great guy. The issue is, one of my friends, we’ll call her Sarah (18F), talks to him wayyy more than she should. He’s really loyal and my friends are also his main friends so I totally get them talking a lot and him engaging in conversations. I honestly didn’t notice the issue until it got bad enough for one of my other close friends, we’ll call her Megan (18F), to bring it up. We were out for coffee when she said she noticed how oddly close Sara is with him. She mentioned how it made her feel bad for me bc of how much Sara laughs and lowk flirts with him whenever she’s around him. He’s a very oblivious person when it comes to girls (he didn’t know I liked him when I made it so obvious), so I know he means no harm when he engages in conversations with Sara, bc he doesn’t know she might have a thing for him. The thing that makes me kind of brush it off is that she has a very flirty personality so it’s not out of the ordinary, but even if I had a flirty personality, I would never flirt with my friends bf. Is it bad that I feel uncomfortable with that or am I just self centered? Bc I love that we’re all friends, my bf is very honest about his past relationships or crushes, and I’m not a jealous person, it just doesn’t sit right with me. It’s not him at all, it’s the fact that something about the way she acts with him makes me think she likes him. Does anyone have any advice on how to confront her?

They are still getting approved by aj. The two food items (dessert display and stew pot) will probably be 70 and 50 saphs, the bonsai plant will be 50 saphs, the desk and wall-mounted mirror will be probably 150 or 100, the pink coffee table will be 60, and the skull will be 50. Also please be aware that the prices are subject to change due to me not remembering the exact prices I plan to set them at right now. 

I also updated my master-chart of all my items and sets. If anyone wants any item or set in specific, please don't hesitate to dm me so I can get it in stock for you! 

I also have other shops full of rares, old items, holiday items, and cheaper items. Although obviously all those profits go to my masterblocks, and the masterblocks are my main focus.

My user is ziggyandthespiders, and if you buy anything from me, thank you for your support! ",15,1766982328.0,AnimalJam,0,0.95,False

No: 1,"I am a singular instance of a person consisting of multiple instances and variations of myself, consisting of the singular and the plural, this is a contradictory statement and a flat out lie.

My existence is limited to that which I can only remember and imagine to that extent I can only be one person, and yet I do not feel like one person, I consistently; to my understanding, exhibit traits MPD, though I can assure you that my thoughts are my own even the ones that come out of nowhere, this is to be expected for my mind is an echo chamber of input and those echos take on personalities of their own and begin to speak, the past the present and the future all congregate in my mind to from ideals of us and me.

My reality is still chained by biology, the brain is an addict to familiar and my success lie in how far I can push comfort away and grasp the burning bones of change until my flesh screams at me to let go, I do not want to let go. Comfort is smothering me like a warm hug, I hate hate hugs not because it uncomfortable, it's not familiar, it's an odd sensation that doesn't feel earned.

Why is it that you are so beautiful to me? Can't you see how far we've come? All the mistakes and lost connections we've endured, that night when you said to yourself ""I'm going to kill myself"" with such conviction I swear I felt the all Heavens and Hells shake with fear convinced a God would walk to their gates and burn it all down for the crime of creating existence, and yet we went to bed in tears, woke up feeling better, that is why I hug you so, you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Biology is limited to what is needed not what is desired or optimal, early hominoids exist in groups consisting of family and friends, life was unforgiving and short alone so gathering together made it easier to stay alive, ""I watch your back you watch mine"" and so it carries on this trait to band together was written into our genetic and epigenetics code making it essential we come and work together, live together, survive as one, we need each's hand to hold when it gets dark all we have is each other when the nightmares creep in the shadows, and all I could think was ""oh God I'm so glad you're here with me now"". We can be like that forever if you want, cause I want to.

The dark is cold and my heart is heavy with possibilities, I don't have long now my time grows near, remember the sun and remember the rain, that time we laughed till our sides acked and our throats sore, the smell of the sunflowers we grew that summer in the backyard, could we do that again one day, do you remember that kiss how my skin prickled and spirits sang, that taste of coffee with friends, I didn't have the cash at the time but they would not accept no, all those memories, even now when we're so sure this will be the death of me, how many deaths have I survived, I've lost count and here we are now about to die again, we are so young in the daylight so sure of eternity, I'll await you here forever if need be, this is why I hug you so.",1,1766982324.0,DeepThoughts,0,1.0,False
