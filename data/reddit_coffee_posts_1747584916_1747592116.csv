It was a good talk but unfortunately the first time I didn't think of asking for coffee and I thought I missed my chance. By chance we met again a month later in the same class and this time I asked her out coffee and i was surprised and flattered that she actually remembered our short conversation from month ago. We had a great time, 1.5-2 hours just for coffee and we exchanged numbers and texts flooded in. We decided to go for a movie and it was a greaaaaaat time, both of us had real fun. 

I had decided to keep my intentions clear, both of us discussed our relationship status (both single), she even pointed out that if she were not single, she would not come like this alone with a boy she knows only for a few days. She told me normally she doesn't go out with a stranger so fast for a movie or anything but with me it just felt right, she pointed out she finds me really smart looking and she likes guys older than her and she had assumed i was older than her (actually it turned out later I'm only younger by an year). 

I went to college the next week for farewell, but i did call her one day and we talked for almost 5 hours. We even met after i came back (she lives nearby) and she came to meet me soon as i texted, we had a great walk for like 2 hours+. 

A few days after this, I just randomly texted about her schedule and she randomly dropped a ""out of context, but I am only looking for a friendship"" bomb. I'm someone who never flirted with her, my love language is roasting. I maintained all physical boundaries with her as i only barely knew her so far. And everytime we went out, i made sure she was comfortable, even texted her before calling if it's okay to call. After this bomb, i just told her ""i didn't have anything specific in mind, i just wanted to know you better and see where it goes"". 

It's been almost a week since then, absolutely ghosted, no replies, no seen, no reaction, absolutely nothing. She always claimed she's not a text person and it felt really weird she broke out such a big news over text and then proceeded to absolutely ghost me. I genuinely thought we had a great connection and never did it once feel like she was just forcing herself to seem interested in my out of politeness. I can't process at all now, that if the above mentioned things don't mean ""she is interested in you"" THEN WHAT DOES? girls, i really need your perspective here.

TL:DR; had a great time with a total stranger girl i met after dance, went coffee, movie, 4 hours call. Suddenly one day drops bomb that she only wants friendship and ghosted me since forever after that. What happened here, need girls' perspective. ",1,1747592033.0,AskIndianWomen,1,1.0,False
1kpqel5,https://i.redd.it/l5zezr8wzk1f1.jpeg,AIO: Husband and Mom Beefing,"This all started on a vacation to southern California. My husband was driving. My mom handed her coloring book to my four year old sitting next to her in the backseat to keep him entertained. As any four year old might do, he started scribbling and flipping to different pages. My mom started telling him to focus on one page at a time, or she was going to take it away which set off a tantrum of an already overtired toddler. 

So from the front of the car, my husband and I try to calm him down using various tactics like breathing exercises, asking him to take a break and do something else, offering perspective (aka "" this is Grandma's coloring book that she's sharing with you."" etc. Basically anything we can think of to try and get him calm. Finally I say something like, ""how about at the next stop we get you your own coloring book?""

Unprompted my mom butts in and says something. I can't remember what, but it was unsolicited parenting advice. To which my husband says, 'It's alright we've got it. We're trying to resolve this with him."" She then tries to defend and repeat what she's saying. He and I both say, ""You keep doing this-We don't want your advice right now."" And then under her breath, my mom says to him, ""Okay yeah, and just make sure you use as many words as possible when you talk to him (toddler)."" Which is a backhanded comment. (My husband is a wordy communicator.) So my husband then raises his voice a little more and basically calls her out for that dig at him. She says ""alright sorry"" and it gets reallllly quiet in the car.

We finally get to our destination. My mom only talked to me for the rest of the day and kept like a 6 foot distance from my husband the rest of the time walking around, and even at the airport 5 hours later. He was over it and I thought she would be too. He bought her coffee, and went back to his normal interactions with her. She was just short in her replies. 

We're back home from our trip and I wake up to this text from her.

# 👤 Alison’s Experience

A few weeks ago, my friend **Alison**, who runs a small independent coffee cart down at the farmer’s market, pulled me aside while I was grabbing my usual oat flat white.

She looked tired — not ""up all night with a new Netflix series"" tired, but the kind that sits behind your eyes. 

She told me her feet had been going numb during her early shifts and by noon they were burning like she’d been dancing on coals.

Alison’s always on her feet, shuffling between brewing espresso and chatting with tourists, so this was more than just an inconvenience — it was messing with her livelihood.

She’d already tried **over-the-counter options for nerve pain relief**, but nothing gave her more than a temporary breather.

I mentioned [Nerve Revive 360](https://theworldhealth.org/nerve-revive-360-official) because I’d just started researching it for the blog and figured it was worth a shot. Two weeks in, she sent me a message — said the tingling had toned down, and she’d finally slept through the night without waking up to the weird zaps in her toes.

She’s still taking it and feels hopeful for the first time in months.

Only thing she grumbled about was the size of the capsules. ""They're not horse pills,"" she said, “but I do have to psych myself up a little.” Still, she’d take that over burning feet before lunch any day.

He was 71.I am [41.It](http://41.It) was a normal day, Easter Monday, we even fought and argued that day and I even blame my self that I contributed to his death. He survived whole 18 hours with that condition which I was told has a high mortality rate. Im from Balkan country and healthcare is not the best around here, usually you need connections to get things done. It's eating my soul with guilt that we could have done more. He died in transport going for state capital to try and get threatment. Since then I must be honest I have behaving the worst in my family. My mother and my sister are way more stronger and composed then me. I cry every day sometimes for hours without end. I must admit that I was sheltered and spoiled by him due to difficult childhood. Every problem I had I brought it to him to the point I started driving car only few years a go. I am so worried about the future and adulthood. You could say that without him I'm totally unprepared for life. The other thing that eats my soul is that he missed the birth of his first grandchild by only 20 days,and that was his greatest wish. He had a hard life filled with struggle and only recently life became really better for all of us and he had to die in such manner. Where is justice in life? Is this all that it is? You struggle and you die? 

I really don't know how to go from here. I started therapy and depresion treatment and it got to point that hospitalisation was even mentioned. Morning are the worst I howl like an animal and in evening and I dunno why I can feel serenity for few hours. God help me I don't even think about my child that much. I'm afraid I will lose my job soon and I could not care about my mom, sister, partner and child. My friends think  they invite me to a cup of coffee or something I will get better, but grief does not work that way. Every day is nightmare and worse then one before. I don't know what I wanted to accomplish with this post, maybe even to vent or say something and ease my soul... 

I just don't know if I can continue and for how long...

I recently booked a Groupon for a dental cleaning. $35, 100+ 4.9 star average reviews, what a steal (I thought)! 

My teeth are in excellent health (brush, floss, mouth wash - religiously), and I don’t have dental insurance…but my last cleaning the doc said my teeth were great, no issue. 

So, the hygienist cleans my teeth, doc comes out to see me she says I should get my 2 wisdom teeth removed as they are in bad shape (shows me the photos, “educates” me on why they are in bad shape). She puts her little pokey tool in another tooth of mine and it sticks in what she is explaining to me is a cavity.

Needless to say, I’m devastated. I take GREAT care of my teeth but tbh I’ve been eating more sweets in recent months so i put the blame on that and guilt and shame myself considering I haven’t had one cavity since I was a child. 

Front desk lady says $1100 is discounted rate for the work uninsured and I can get in today if I want for the surgery and I’ll be put under for the operation. My gut tells me to wait and not jump on that booking (thank god). 

I book a different dentist to get a 2nd opinion. Doc checks my teeth and takes him 3 minutes to see I don’t need my wisdom teeth removed AND I don’t have a cavity (it’s just a little ledge and a coffee stain or something). He explains to me some dentists that don’t own the place basically get paid on commission… 

I’m upset to say the least. I work in healthcare and to see a medical doctor lying to the understandably naive public (Me) to get financial gain pisses me off. I left her a 1 star review and honest doc a 5 star one. 

Not joking about this, my gf went to a dentist a couple months later and was told she had 3 cavities, I said PLEASE go get a 2nd opinion. 2nd doc said NO CAVITIES. 

TL;DR:

My dentist said I needed wisdom teeth extraction and tooth filling costing $1100. I got a 2nd opinion, and turns out my teeth are in perfect shape. 

I almost had unnecessary surgery to help line the pockets of this doc!

Work hard to find a dentist who is honest and not greedy and get 2nd opinions until you do!

I don't know how to format for reddit, but he said to make sure that I did.

I live on a large property with a small house in the front. There are many small hot springs in the semi-rural mountain area that I live in, with many used by homeowners in their backyard. Many are piped indoors, but some have hot tubs built around them. I happen to have a active one in my backyard (picture an in-ground hot tub being fed in from the hot spring) near my left neighbors house (I'll call her CN for crazy neighbor). A small stream runs through the far backyards of the neighborhood and it used for gardens and little nature areas that everyone on the street enjoys. I have my small fruit/pepper garden watered by this stream and take really good care of it. For some visualization, it has a good amount of water flowing down and everyone on the street uses it some way. My right neighbor (who's a really chill dude, who I'll call Jay) has small pools he made that are fed by the stream, and two neighbors down has a garden similar to mine. Now on to the actual story.

  
When I bought the house, the previous owners were sued by CN, her claiming that the land was rightfully hers. I don't know the details of her argument, but it was thrown out (as far as I know). The previous owners warned me of CN and not to engage with her family. When I moved in, CN's kids (I'd say probably 8, 9, and 10) brought over cookies and welcomed me to the neighborhood. I thought that the previous owner was exaggerating as they seemed sweet. I invited CN and her family to a small BBQ and they accepted. The second that they got in the house, CN started to explain the 'rules of the neighborhood'.  I thought it was pretty normal (like to not play loud music after 9, keep your car in the driveway to keep the street uncluttered, etc. Common sense rules) until she got to some rules reguarding the stream and the hot springs. 

  
She said that kids were allowed in all parts of the stream (in private backyards) and that everyone could use eachother's hot springs (I have the only hot spring on the street, so I was surprised by that). I interrupted her and told her that I wasn't comfortable with those, and she scoffed, saying that all neighbors were fine with it. I told her that I still wasn't comfortable with it. She ignored me, continuing with some questionable rules. The rest of the night was fine, but I felt like I wouldn't want to do it again. 

  
I talked to some neighbors across the next couple days, who all told me to steer clear of CN and that her rules were BS. I went over to CN's house and told her that I had talked to the other neighbors and that I wasn't comfortable with anyone being in my backyard without my permission. She scoffed and said ok. I had a lunch with Jay and he told me who CN was: A serial suer with her lawyer on speed dial to get whatever she wants. CN had sued a small chain pizza place in town into debt for having peanut oil on her pizza when she was allergic to it. The pizza chain didn't even have peanut oil (and many people in the small community believed that she put it on), but still lost everything. I decided not to ever talk to her or her family.

  
A week later, I got home from the grocery store to see CN's kids (I'll call them EKs for entitled kids) splashing in my hot spring tub (its outside and usually has a lid on that two small kids would definitely not be able to take off as it is heavy and large). I tell them that they're not allowed in it and to leave my yard immediately, and they stand their ground, telling me that their mom (CN) told them that it was theirs and that they could use it. I told them that that's not true and to leave now. They finally do. Before you think that I'm an asshole for that, remember that pools/hot tubs are dangerous and I don't want to be liable. I headed back out to buy locks for my gates. When I got back, CN was now there, demanding why I kicked her kids out. She reminded me of the ""rules"", but I told her to leave immediately and that my security camera was recording. She cursed at me for a min or two, then left. I was bluffing as I did not have security cameras, but I did order them on amazon that night. The next day was fine, replanting a lot of my plants from my apartment's balcony into the empty garden (the one that's watered by the stream). I noticed that CN kept looking over the fence.

  
For the following weeks, CN complained about the trees in my yard, the color of the fence, what I'm doing with the stream, etc. Jay occasionally came over and told her to f off. Three weeks ago, I left for a couple days for a friend's wedding. I kept getting security alerts saying that there was motion in my backyard, often her kids playing in my garden (trampling my dear shishito peppers). I texted Jay to tell them to get out. If you're wondering why not call the police, they wouldn't do anything as they're just some kids. I had a suspicion that CN was telling them to do these things, but I didn't have much evidence.

  
On the drive back, I got a security alert that there was motion in my backyard. I didn't check as I was driving, but when I stopped for gas, I checked and saw CN instructing a plumbing team installing piping from MY hotspring into THEIR yard. I had it save all of the footage and I sent messages to Jay about it. Jay told them that they weren't allowed to be doing that, but since it wasn't his house, they didn't listen to him. I called the police and they went, but they had already installed the piping. The team was just leaving through the gate (with a broken lock on the ground), when the police showed up. They said that they had been hired by the homeowner. The police waited for me to get there while talking to the team of workers, and I told them that I was the homeowner and that I hadn't payed them to do it. They looked confused. I went with the police into the backyard and I started ripping the unsecured piping out with a crowbar. 

  
CN starts shrieking from her yard and puts her head over the fence and starts yelling that I'm destroying private property and that she would sue me. CN then says that she has a contract with the owner of the house to have their (my) hot spring water. The police are now confused. She shows a contract that read that  she was paying me $2 per month in exchange for the water. CN won't give it to me so I could look at it besides waving it around in the air. The police eventually leave and warn me not to destroy the piping. I ripped up the small pipe that connects to the source as she's telling me that she'll see me in court. I contacted my lawyer and she said that CN had no case as she didn't know my signature and it would be easy to prove it was forged. I still haven't been served by CN's lawyer, but know that I will soon. In the meantime, I've been sitting in the hot tub for long baths while talking to myself loudly about how much I love it. Petty, but it made me feel good hearing the growls from across the fence.

  
This is the final thing that made me post here, my garden wilting and dying at an unnatural rate. I heard a commotion out in CN's yard and I peeked over and saw her slowly pouring a massive jug of chemicals into the communal stream, which goes down to mine. I don't know if its herbicides, plant killer, or something like bleach (it doesn't smell like bleach so I don't think its that), but its rapidly killing my plants. I haven't eaten any of the fruit/peppers since as I'm worried I might get sick. I think that if I can get definitive proof of her doing it, I can maybe use it in court to prove how crazy she is. People swim in pools from the stream, so I warned Jay not too for the time being and told him to tell others. I know one neighbor removed her garden from the soil and moved it away from the stream just in case it got down to hers.

  
I'm unsure of what I should do next. I don't think I live in a two party consent state for video recording as it doesn't list it as one on the pdf I found. I might crosspost this into legal advice just in case (I do already have a lawyer, but it might be useful hearing free opinions from the internet).

Edit: I forgot to say that I had water testing sticks arriving tomorrow.

TLDR: Crazy neighbor steals hot spring water and pours chemicals into communal stream, poisoning my garden

Update 1: Jay offered to use a large drum in his garage to temporarily remove the water from the stream and seeing your comments, I’m taking him up on his deal. All the neighbors down the street that I’ve talked to so far (two besides Jay) agreed. One who has two sons said that they might block off the start of the stream. It is a small outlet of a moderately sized creek. It will probably be blocked off not that hard. Jay said that he can probably get the drum in place by tonight as his dad can help. Jay also has a sweet dog and definitely wants to protect it. I am going to remove my plants from the soil nearby the stream. Also, for reference in size of the stream, it’s about 1-2 feet across. Truly just a stream. There’s lots of obstacles and things that would probably filter out, but we definitely still have to be safe. I’ll update later tonight or tomorrow.

Update 2: Big news! The nice neighbors’ kids dammed up the stream at where it starts. It’s a couple pieces of wood, a branch or two, and a lot of small rocks. There’s still a tiny bit of water flowing, but it’s absorbed by the soil higher up before CN. Jay got the drum out, but we turned out not to need it. There’s water still in the pools in his backyard and we plan to do a water test. Apparently pH tests are sold in a store just 10 mins away, so I will head there as soon as I finish this post.

Update 3: Jays getting the pH test and an oxygen level test, but I don’t know how oxygen levels would play into it. I’ll look at responses and figure out what to do next. I will call authorities soon.

Update 4: The water test: pH came lower than the creek water before CN’s house (a full .9 lower). Nitrates a bit higher, Dissolved Oxygen significantly lower. That’s the only real changes in between the two tests. I wonder if she just poured a lot of vinegar. I think herbicides do change pH, but .9 is quite a bit I think.

Update 5: Big update! The makeshift dam broke and water has been flowing down, but it’s been slow. CN complained to a neighbor up the street that she’s on speaking terms with about me being a major asshole for not letting her kids use my hot spring tub. She let it slip that she poured household vinegar in the stream as “justice”. The neighbor was also shown the contract for the pipes and she said that she didn’t even have it signed by me. She and her lawyer had signed it, but without any signature space for me. I thought that she forged my signature, but she didn’t have any agreement (fraudulent or otherwise) on my side whatsoever. The neighbor similarly dislikes her, but their kids are friends, so she has to talk to CN. I sent all the info to a local environmental charity that has contacts within environmental protection agencies. They usually deal with lakes and dumping, so this was in what they deal with regularly. 

The police were outside CN’s house a couple hours ago and took her to the station. CN is back at her house, now yelling over the fence profanities while I’m having a coffee. I don’t know if they arrested her and she payed bail or that she just was taken in for questioning or something. I know her brother in law works at the police station, but I wouldn’t doubt that her family members have a strained relationship with her. I hope that she’s stuck with a giant fine and/or jail time. CN’s lawyer still hasn’t served me regarding the pipes, and my lawyer is saying that CN has no case whatsoever. I’ll update as soon as anything interesting comes up.

Update 6: My power just went out in most of my house. I think CN just flipped the breakers to annoy me. Going outside ASAP

Update 7: CN indeed did flip the breakers. As far as I know, the security camera has an internal battery for some time after it’s disconnected from the power so I don’t have to worry about her doing anything.

Revenge Discussion Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1kk45k1/updatediscussion_revenge_tactics/

Update 8: I called the owner of the copy/print/delivery shop and he agreed to what I said in the previous post. I removed all of the pipes from my yard and put them into bags. I didn’t have as much plastic bags and boxes as I thought so I’m paying extra for the owner of the copy shop to supply them. He just delivered the first one to CN (I watched from the street) and CN’s husband answered. He shouted for CN and she came up. I didn’t hear any of the discussion, but she signed delivery sheet, took the package (of a single small corner pipe piece), and stormed into her house. She went up to the 2nd story window and proceeded to glare at me since, still glaring as I sit on my couch while writing this. Working from home will be so nice for watching this.

Update 9: Since my last post, there has been one more pipe delivery to CN and she is pissed. She stormed over to my house (after signing the delivery which I thought she would stop doing) and banged on the door. I started recording my front door and opened the door (I'm not dumb enough to let her in). CN starts shrieking about how I'm awful and that I had to keep the pipes installed as it was her property and that we had a contract. When I told her that the contract wasn't legal at all, she starts screaming at me. I stepped inside for a second and called the police with the door closed. CN continues banging on my door. I don't open until a police car comes down the street.

I tell the police that I don't want her ever to be on my property and that she is tresspassing. They relay that to her, and she takes up a hurt old lady act (for reference, she is in her 40s). CN tells them that my hot tub burned her youngest child and that I was luring kids in. I showed the police the camera footage and they asked her to come to the station with them. I'm assuming that she made some fake report, but I guess that will be another charge of lying to a police officer. I think that the officer (not CN's brother in law) believed me and saw that she was in fact a CN.

I saw CN get back into her house and once again went up to the top window, staring. I closed the blinds. I thought she would stop (honestly it doesn't bother me), but to my surprise, she crosses the street to the side of the hill (theres a slope on the other side of the street from the houses. There's more houses up the slope) and stares through my front window. I don't have blinds for that one and was about to head to a different room when I see her trip backwards (theres a small ditch for runoff) and land on her butt. CN lets out a ungodly shriek (it wasn't that loud, but I'd like to say it was) as she storms back into her house.

I feel at this point, with all of the stuff from my lawyer, from reddit, and neighbors saying that I am completely in the right and that CN is insane has made this more into entertainment than a scary situation for me. I have multiple locks arriving in a couple days and a new security camera for the side yard. If you have any legal suggestions, please tell me. If there's anything I should be aware of, please tell me.

Update 9: I’ve been told that messing with CN is probably not going to help out legally, especially with a restraining order, so I just told the copy shop owner just to deliver it all at once. I don’t know if that’s happened yet, but I’m fine not being looking when I happens. I will file a restraining order today. I don’t know how it works, but I hope I can complete it today. No new news from CN except Jay saying that she looked really mad. I know this isn’t a big update, but it’s an update on the situation.

Update 10: This happened last night and I was too tired to update after it. CN's husband (I'll call him NH for neighbor husband) knocked on my door last night, alone. CN wasn't there, so I answered it. He then tells me that CN is ""going through some things right now"" and some other stuff. He then asks me if I could ""let sleeping dogs lie. She did some stuff wrong, but she's a really great person"". I told him that I would consider it. I'm not, but I didn't want to be in that conversation. I honestly thought that he would apologize about it, but making excuses like that is so pathetic. According to many of my neighbors, CN's been like this for years. I think he's trying to cover themselves from the bomb they just planted. That's all. New updates probably coming soon.

Update 11: I was typing this out earlier, but it didn’t save as a draft so I will paraphrase it instead of writing it all out like earlier.

I went out to get my mail and I noticed CN rush out of her house onto her porch to watch me. I take the mail and head inside. Through the endless sea of junk mail, there was a wedding invitation. Nobody I know remotely nearby is getting married and I didn’t recognize the names or the faces. On the back was a handwritten letter thanking me for volunteering my house for the bachelorette party and inviting me to wedding at a local venue. 

1. Definitely did NOT invite anyone to use my property for a party
2. My backyard isn’t the biggest for a party
3. I don’t know who these people are

I took a picture of the front and the back and then went and made a copy of the invitation and cut it to the right size. I then took the copy and walked in front of CN’s house (in the street). She is looking from the door. I then light the copy on fire (safely). She runs out and starts yelling at me. I am not entirely listening as I had an earbud in my left ear listening to a podcast (I listen to podcasts while doing my routines and hadn’t bothered to take it out) and at one point, I heard the groom’s name. Clearly she was behind it (I knew before, this just solidified the fact). I called her husband and told him that I was not hosting the bachelorette party and to leave me alone. He asks which one. I told him the names of the bride and groom. He is audibly surprised. He then tells me that the groom is CN’s son from a teenage pregnancy (not with him). He then said that he would talk to CN about it, calling it an accident. 

I find the name of the dad of the groom and call him. He sounded super genuinely grateful when I told him who I was. I asked him about CN and he said that she had left the baby with him and when he had sued for child support, the judge said that it was his poor choices that led to the baby and he was responsible for it, without child support. I told him the situation, and he sounded defeated. Apparently, the groom had been quick to forgive his absent mother (CN) and had invited her against the dad’s wishes. He said that he would tell the groom and the bride about the situation. 

I then had a thought that would be the absolute perfect revenge:
I offered to host the party for free with 2 rules
1. They don’t damage anything and clean everything up
2. CN is blocked at the door of the wedding despite her invitation
3. My invite to the wedding still stands.

He said he would discuss it with the bride and groom. Even if he says no, it’s worth a try. 

I just realized I typed it all up in detail despite what I said at the beginning. I will probably get the news in the next couple days.

Update 12: This is just some clarification (it hasn't been brought up, but might as well.
The wedding is happening on the 24th. I'm pretty sure the invite I got was a spare for later as I doubt they sent out invites so last minute. 
CN reached out to the groom when she heard about him getting married. The groom is in his 20s and had never seen his bio mom before (as far as I know).

Update 13: I will call the groom's dad GD and groom and bride G and B

I was looking over some comments just before posting this and realized I don't want to be screwed over, so I am staying back.

Also, GD gave me a call extremely late last night and told me that G wanted to meet his mom (CN) at the wedding. B was supportive, thinking it would be an extremely wholesome wedding. GD said that he would try to find another location for the party, but that it would be hard this late as B had a large bridesmaids group. GD is going to help CN with preparing for the wedding at his son's request, even though he thinks it might be a disaster.

My plants that are near the stream look scorched as if they were in a fire. (I'm talking about the plants that are next and around the stream, not in my garden.

I think the next steps are through legal means and not through petty actions.

I will keep you all updated.

Update 14: CN had been trying to gain access to the hot spring for as long as she's known of it. She had tried lawsuits, land disputes, and other legal and legally dubious means to get it. When she heard of her son becoming married, she thought that she could have a good attempt at gaining access to the hot spring.
CN had initially offered to use her house for a price for the bridesmaids party, but since it didn't have anything good for a party, B had declined. She couldn't find another place though, but still didn't want CN's house. CN had then had the bright idea to tell the B and G that she had had a natural, healing, and amazing hot spring in her yard and B said yes. 
This is when CN tries the whole piping the hot spring to her yard. She obviously doesn't get far into that plan. After I dismantle all the piping, she volunteers my house and backyard for the party.
I think that the stream pollution was lashing out because she was mad before she volunteered my house.
No updates besides what I've pieced together from assorted sources.

Update 15: GD called me about 10 mins ago. I was going to post the update right away, but I was reading some of the comments.
This is what he said, and asked if my offer about hosting the bridesmaids party was still standing (this is heavily paraphrased to be readable, but all the main points and events are there).
GD met up with CN to talk to her about the wedding, mostly setting boundaries. He went to her house (with his phone recording just in case anything happened, knowing the history of CN). 
GD is talking to CN very formally, as much straight facts as possible when he glances through a cracked open door into her bedroom. I don't remember the word he used to describe it (it was a very good way to say it), but kind of out of the corner of your vision when you're avoiding eye contact. GD sees multiple white dresses laying on CN's bed. They are fancy dresses. Not quite wedding dresses, but definitely close. GD can't stop staring at it. He then asks CN about what she's wearing to the wedding, and CN says that she has a couple dresses picked out.
He connects the dots and subtly leaves the conversation, calls B and G and tells them what he saw. He then gives G some of CN's history. B then asks if they can do the house with the hot spring then.
GD tells me that he knows that I don't like CN and that I wouldn't be at the wedding, but that the rest of the deal would stand. I told him sure, but not to let CN know about it, just letting herself think that I got pushed around by him into hosting.
I know that the agencies I contacted about her pouring vinegar into the creek have been investigating, so even though it likely wouldn't, I hope it all falls out on the day of the wedding

Update 16: I’ve been asked for an update. There has not been much crazy neighbor activity over the time that I haven’t updated. I think she installed a step stool on her side of the fence as she’s been looking evil eying me whenever I’m in the hot tub. The weddings coming up next weekend, so I’m interested in what’s going to happen. Not much has happened besides that.

I am looking for any tips and tricks you have to force yourself to get your protein in.

I am 5 weeks in and ~15 lbs down, feeling great and losing a lot of cravings that had me in a chokehold (sugary coffee, soda, candy, sweet treats at night). One thing I have ALWAYS craved and even binged on in the past is dairy, specifically cheese.

Zepbound has significantly helped, but the smaller craving is still there. To get my fill in, I opt for low calorie string cheese (8g of protein).

But I'm not hungry for the majority of the day and I find that I'm reaching for a few of these throughout the day with fruit and nuts instead of true meals. So my question for all of you is, what is your tip on getting protein in when you're simply not hungry? How do you feel about protein bars, and if you like them, any recommendations?

***Snake is shocked.  Snake consumes itself.  Snake dies.***

*But it felt meaningless.* 

Snake walked with her among the tulips blooming in the park.  The female friend said he just didn't feel there with here, she wanted a picture of them together. It would make her happy. 

*But the flowers had no meaning to him*.

They journeyed on to a museum about Doggerland.  It was the first time either of them saw a reproduction of a mammoth.  Snake moved slowly through the air, permeating all of the displays with its taint.  The female friend thought it sounded fun to create a book series about living among mammoths.

*But the great mammoths of the past seemed boring to him.*

Moving on to the food court, Snake slowed his feet to a snail's pace.  Snake has no appetite.  The female friend on the other hand was dying to try the T-rex triple burger.  Snake hates such trivial things.

I’ve had a handful of temporary jobs here and there to help with bills but nothing consistent (bar kitchens, uber eats, Instacart, etc.) I recently started working full-time at my local McDonalds, and I have to honestly say this is one of the worst jobs I have ever worked. I’ve been there for a little over a week now. The majority of the staff besides myself, one other new hire, and a few managers speak mainly Spanish, so the language barrier makes it hard to ask anyone questions about what to do. Plus there’s been a handful of occasions where I can tell my coworkers are talking about me badly in Spanish. My first week I was just put on the register without any real explanation about what to do or how it works. I was just told to look at the menu options at the register and get familiar with it. I’ve had managers get frustrated with me when they tell me to do things like making French fries or certain coffee drinks, even though they hadn’t taken the time to show me how most of the equipment works. So I spend most of my days taking people’s orders, bagging food and making ice cream cones. They had me work the drive thru on one of my first late shifts, without explaining how the drive thru window works and we ended up with a line of cars out of the parking lot. The only thing that makes up for this is the customers. I’ve had many of our regulars come up to me telling me that I’m doing a great job and they really appreciate the extra mile I go for them. Our store is near a lot of senior living homes and homes for people with mental disabilities, so things like bringing the food to their table and checking on them periodically mean a lot to them.

I meet her in front of the elevator to talk to her about the nuisance she is causing and she is super understanding and apologizes, following that I ask her if she wants to be forgiven and she replies, go ahead and tell me! So I asked her to invite me for coffee at her place, after which she readily accepted and proposed to me at the beginning of the afternoon since she had to see a friend just before. Time passes and at 2:00 p.m. she comes knocking at my house to tell me that she was sorry because she got her schedule wrong and that she has to see her friend in town now, {THIS IS WHERE IT BECOMES UNCONPREHENSIBLE}, She says to me: take my number and don't hesitate to call me and assure me that she will be there. And we postpone the meeting at her place until tomorrow at the same time 2:00 p.m. The year tomorrow arrives and when I go to knock at her house I realize that she is not there so I decide to send her a message telling her that I knocked at her house but that no one has opened, I wait 2 hours with no answer I decide to call her and she does not pick up but sends me a message to tell me that she will call me back... No news for hours but in the evening I hear her going home around 9 p.m. and coming out at 10 p.m. while passing in front of the door because I am in the middle of the corridor and she lives at the end. 24 hours later still nothing but I hear her coming home at the end of the day and there is total silence. I didn't ask her anything except to have a coffee to chat quietly and stay on good terms, she takes the liberty of coming to my house, giving me her number without me asking, encouraging me to call her, she even tells me that she's really happy to have a coffee with me and ultimately ghosts me without any explanation. My question is why did she give me her number herself, why did she tell me not to hesitate to call her so that in the end I don't pick up and tell me that she will call me back so as not to do it? All the while knowing that I am her neighbor and that there is a strong risk of running into her and that she suspects that I am going to ask her what she is playing. What is the point of standing me up and asking me to call her only to not answer and not call me back when she told me she would, only to ghost me tomorrow?",1,1747591156.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

**The Coffee Table** 

I don't like horror comedies. It just doesn't work on me, the exception being The cabin in the Woods (if that counts?) and the recent The Ugly stepsister. But here it worked entirely, I found the film hilarious. Well, the beginning of it. I laughed all the way through the intro, right up to the accident. What a nightmare. I don't have children myself and don't want any, but when my niece was born I had several nightmares on exactly the same theme.  

I dreamt I was babysitting my niece, and it was going horribly wrong. In one dream, I put her in the fridge because she was hot, and ended up with a frozen baby. In another, I let her fall down the stairs (and judging by the result, she must have been falling at mach 3). But the most horrifying part of these dreams wasn't even the horrible death of my niece, it was the absolute horror of having done something irreversible, unwanted, and knowing that I was going to have to warn my brother and deal with the aftermath. Needless to say, I was particularly affected by this film, which made me feel as if I'd been watching my nightmare on the big screen for 1h30.  

The actors are perfect (with a special mention for the actress who plays Ruth - this character is incredible). The tempo is perfect too, but if it's a quasi-huis clos with just a handful of characters, there's no drag. I also liked that we knew in advance what was going to happen. You can see it all coming miles in advance, but for me it doesn't spoil the fun at all, on the contrary. We wait in horror, for example, for the moment when they discover the baby's head under the armchair, and when it happens: yes, indeed, it's awful.  

An excellent surprise. When my friend and I came out of the cinema, we were staring at all the babies we saw (to make sure they had their heads on).  

  

**Sinners** 

I really liked Sinners, but I think I would have liked it even more without the vampires. For one thing, I'm indifferent to vampire films (apart from Coppola's Dracula), they've never given me any sense of dread or creepiness. But above all, because of the music. The use of music, and the music itself, are clearly the absolute strong point of this film. I would have liked more, much more. In fact, my favorite scene with the vampires was their Irish dance.  

But the film is very good: the photography, the landscapes, the complete cast, the lighting... I really liked the ending too. I really didn't see the time go by and can't wait to see it again. And even if vampires aren't completely my cup of tea, I enjoyed their treatment in this film. They're ""subtle"", in the sense that apart from the glow (very well done) in their eyes and their speed, they look more or less normal. I liked their style and motivation.   

Oh, and Michael B. Jordan. He's already hard to look at for too long because there's too much beauty, but here we have two.

We met a few years ago through my university library and became friends pretty quickly. Over time, I opened up to him about some really personal things — childhood bullying, family stuff, and mental health struggles (including suicidal thoughts). I trusted him.

Things changed when he invited me to his church group. At first it was okay, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations (mostly pro-Trump stuff). I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics, but George kept pressing — even suggesting my views were “inherited from \[my\] dad.”

That comment really rubbed me the wrong way, so I told him I didn’t appreciate it and asked for an apology. Instead, he refused and basically said our friendship was over through text. Still, I agreed to meet in person that same day — even bought him a coffee to smooth things over.

Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was trying to “drag him down to \[my\] level,” and said I was “sounding like the devil.” He then tried to pray over me, which I declined, and when he told me to hug him, I just offered a handshake. I left feeling humiliated and ended the friendship via text that evening.

It’s been four months. I’ve distanced myself from the church group and anyone tied to him. But a few days ago I saw him at the library. He was sitting a few rows ahead with his back to me, and after I left to get a drink, I came back to find he had moved seats — now facing me directly. It felt really uncomfortable.

His brother also removed me on social media. George has been acting like nothing happened — giving me fist bumps and saying “what’s up Jakob” like everything’s fine. A few of his church friends reached out early on, but I just said I was busy. Now no one does.

I’m wondering if he’s painted me in a bad light to them, but I honestly just want to move on. Still, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being cold or overly sensitive. I don’t want to create drama, but I also don’t want to be guilted into staying in touch with someone who made me feel small.

So… how should I handle future run-ins, especially if he keeps acting like nothing happened? Given his argumentative nature. ",3,1747590958.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

Husband has lied and cheated, amongst other things... wtf do I do?","I'm going to try and keep this brief, but I know it probably won't be. I'm typing as fast as I can because I have two small kids and they are very demanding.  
  
 My husband (30) and I (30) have been married since 2019. Our first child was born 2020. 

When I was pregnant with our first, we both decided it would be better for me to stay at home with our baby until they went to school, or longer if we decided to homeschool (our public schools are horrible.) So I was jobless for about 2 and a half years. 

After our baby was born, it was like a switch was flipped. My husband suddenly was very possessive about money and it took a while for him to put my name on his account, and then almost two years for him to get me a debit card to have access to said account. I had to ask him for money or to put gas in the car for me, and he would always tell me I didn't have anywhere I needed to go, or to go get my own job if I wanted money. I would bring up that we both decided it was better for me to stay home and raise our child instead of getting a job that wouldn't cover the cost of childcare anyway. We'd be losing money on childcare and leaving our baby with strangers. Every time I reminded him of that decision, he would calm down and agree, etc. Same thing went for my driver's license. It expired not long after I gave birth, and every attempt I had to schedule an appointment to go replace it, my husband would always have be cancel and reschedule for some reason or another. 

I should also mention that I did not know how much debt my husband was in until months into our marriage. He was in massive credit card debt, spanning about fifteen credit cards, as well as debt from the couple of years he had attended college. We never seemed to have any money for anything I needed or wanted, but he was always able to preorder video games and consoles and collector's boxes, etc.

We bought our first home at the end of 2020. We bought what we thought would be a starter home, something to build equity instead of just losing money on rent. Two weeks after we bought our home, I found out by accident that he had emailed his (supposedly) abusive ex, on the 23rd of December. I confront him, not aggressively, but curiously. The email was him asking for her phone number or to text him at his. I never saw any texts, and I will never know what was said. When I confronted him, he lashed out angrily at me for ""snooping"", and eventually admitted that he had ""unresolved feelings for her.""

While we had a rocky patch after this, it didn't last long, because I hadn't caught him lying like this before and I naively took him for his word that it was done and he would get over these feelings.

The job my husband has is a union job, and for years, he was a ""temp"" worker and would get a 9-week layoff annually. So every year for 9 weeks, he would be laid off from that workplace. For two years, he got a job elsewhere to supplement income during that time off from his main job. Before his third layoff came around, he told me he was not making enough money to cover bills and debts, and didn't want to get a second job on top of his main job. He wanted me to try to find a job. I told him once again that whatever money I would be able to make wouldn't cover the cost of childcare, and that we'd still be losing money, but that I would try to find something I could do from home.

Seemingly fortunately, I found a job for a preschool teaching position that would allow me to bring one child of my own for no cost. I had the qualifications and ended up being hired. While this was not a mistake financially, it definitely had a mental toll on me and our child. The employer was corrupt and lied to the staff and parents, and most of the other teachers were cruel and/or neglectful to the children. I had several disputes with other teachers for this behavior, to which nothing improved (because the boss was also terrible), and decided not to bring our child anymore once my husband was back on the layoff.

So about four or five months into working for this preschool, my husband is on layoff and we both agree that he will not get a job during this time and will stay home with our child. For over two years, I had stayed home with our toddler, potty training, teaching colors, sign language, practical skills, etc. I had kept the house as clean as I possibly could with a toddler and two big dogs. But my husband still always complained that not everything was spotless, or that toys would be out and not tucked away when he was home. Now I'm the working parent, and he is the stay at home parent.

Every single evening when I would come home from work, the house was such a horrendous wreck that I could barely believe my eyes. All I asked of him was that he continue to take our toddler outdoors every day, to the park or on a walk, and keep the chores going so they didn't pile up. Pretty reasonable. But every single weekday, I would come home to him clearly having played video games literally all day, and having stuck our child in front of a TV with snacks for the better part of the day as well. The toddler's room was filthy with spilled drinks and snacks all over the floor, even once a broken ceramic bowl with shards everywhere, and the TV playing.

The dishes would not be touched, except for whatever was added to cook and eat. The laundry hadn't budged. He claimed he didn't know where the broom or vacuum were but our house is tiny with no storage, so they are literally always out. So every day I would come home and have to tidy that up, and every weekend I would have to get it all caught up and out of the way and remind him once more to keep it up. 

At this point, we had a sex-less marriage. I was always depleted from being in ""mom mode"" and ""teacher mode"", and my husband's daily behavior (he won't brush his teeth for weeks, he won't clean up after himself, he's constantly gaming, etc) and attitude were not a huge turn-on. He was also guilting me about not being intimate with him near constantly, which also was a turn-off. However, after about a year of not having sex, I chose to ""throw him a bone"" one night just to stop the guilting. He initiated and I went along with it, mainly just to get it over with. 

I had asked him previously to get a vasectomy because I wanted to be one and done. He kept telling me he would schedule it, then wouldn't. I kept telling him that it was one of the huge factors of us not having sex. For medical reasons that will remain private, I am not able to take birth control. And for some reason, after having our first, condoms felt like actual fire was going inside of me. We tried several different types and brands, and it all was so painful that we couldn't proceed. Anyway, he knows 100% that I want to be one and done. I have told him several times that I would be pretty unhappy if I got pregnant again. 

He still doesn't pull out, and I can't tell when he's climaxing when we have sex. I can't feel a difference down there, and he is silent. Regardless, he finishes then tells me he is done, and I panic and ask why he didn't pull out. He tells me it's because he can't feel when he's about to finish. This confuses me though because when I have given him oral sex or a hand-job, he knows when to tell me to slow down.

I tell him I hope I'm not pregnant and that he needs to get me Plan B as soon as possible (I had to work at 7am the next morning.) He tells me he will and laughs at me, telling me to stop worrying and that I'm not pregnant. However, he also laughed at me and told me I wasn't pregnant when I was with our first. And then laughed at me again in the delivery room and told me to stop worrying when I said I might need an emergency C-section, and I ended up needing an emergency C-section. So I had a bad feeling.

I go to work and come home, and he hasn't gotten me the Plan B. I go and get it myself, along with a pregnancy test. I take it when I get home and hope it works. A few weeks later, I pee on the pregnancy test, and low and behold, pregnant with a second. Yes, I KNOW it takes two to tango. When I saw the positive pregnancy test, I was angry with myself for having sex for his sake. And YES, I know abortion was an option, and I briefly considered it. I'm not religious, so that was not part of my decision not to get an abortion. I decided not to because I felt it would haunt me, having one child and knowing how much I love having them. I thought it would haunt me to wonder who I had missed out on. And yes I know that's confusing with being open to taking plan B. It's just how I felt about it at the time.

His 9-week layoff ends, and he returns to work. Not long after, winter break comes around for the preschool and I submit my two week notice. I finish working there and return to being a stay-at-home mom. After the holidays, I discover that my husband had opened two credit cards without my knowledge. He did it to cover an outlandish amount of spending for presents. He always does this - spends an inordinate amount of money on gifts. And frequently, gifts for me are actually gifts for him. Lingerie, consoles, video games, etc. I discover he opened a credit card through our bank and a credit card with Victoria's Secret, to get me lingerie and perfume samplers. I'm appalled, because his credit card debt is what has us living as though we are destitute all the time. This causes another rift in our relationship, as now I'm finding out that he lies and has to be found out about seemingly anything (I'm leaving out a lot of minor lies) and that he can't keep a promise. Over the course of our marriage thus far, I had drained my Roth IRA and my Nest529 account to cover us financially here and there when needed. 

Our second baby was born via another c-section in summer 2023. My sister came from out-of-state to support me while my husband is at work. He opted not to take leave until a few months after the birth instead of during, for reasons I can't remember. Eight days postpartum, while my sister is staying with us, and while I'm still in pain from the c-section, my husband tells me he wants a divorce while we are in a drive-through.

Although it is sudden and unexpected, it doesn't come as a complete shock to me. We had talked before about separating, although he always had a breakdown and begged me to reconsider.

My sister returns home and my husband and I talk about what to do moving forward. As we talk, he starts to change his tune and say that he doesn't want to be separated and ideally things between us would work out. It seemed to me that he used divorce as a threat, and when I asked him how to proceed, I called his bluff.

A few months later, he has left his iPad out and is sleeping off a night shift. I open the iPad with the intent to take some silly pictures with the kids and change his background/lock screen. When the iPad unlocks, it is on a picture he has saved of a girl who looks like she is freshly 18 or not much older. I scroll to the side and find that he has about eight photos of this girl saved to his iPad. I have no idea who she is. They are not pictures that are obviously from a porn site or anything, it honestly looks like pictures that were saved from a Facebook profile or maybe a dating profile. 

Now alarmed, I go to his internet browser and find that he has been on websites talking to other women. I can't load any of the messages because it requires me to log in and I don't know his login info, and it isn't saved.

I take pictures with my phone of his iPad screen, of the photos of the girl, the search history, and then go into his iMessages to see if anything is there. I don't find any active text threads with anybody other than a female coworker, whom I did not previously know about. The messages appear to be purely about work, but the tone in which he is messaging her seems overly friendly/intimate. I look the coworker up on Facebook and can't find any profile, and have no idea if these photos are of said coworker or not. I still do not know who this girl is to this day. 

I confronted him immediately, waking him up and showing him what I had found. He sighs and acts like it's no big deal. He says it's just a girl he found online, just a girl he was talking to, that she's probably not even a girl and is probably a guy catfishing. He tells me he only saved those photos to masturbate with. I tell him I want a divorce for real this time and he starts crying and begging me not to take his kids away from him. I told him I'm not taking his kids away from him, that we agreed if things ended, we would do things as amicably as possible for the sake of the kids.

This goes on all day until he has to go to another night shift. I'm worried because now he's stressed and on little sleep while working, and I'm also scared because I want to leave but I have a few months old baby and a three year old, and no family in the state. No support system. Everybody I know is somebody I know through my husband.

Time passes and we agree to live together for financial reasons until something can be worked out. He sets up a trip for me to take with the kids so I can visit my sister out of state. 

That following summer, the kids and I go and stay with my sister for a month and a half. He works his main job and starts DoorDashing to pay bills and send us money while we are away.

When we return home, the house is absolutely filthy. Dust and grime have accumulated, laundry has not been touched save for some of his clothes (but he tells me he just purchased more socks and underwear if he didn't have any clean.) Dishes are literally exactly in the same place and mold has grown on quite a bit of them and has grown on leftovers in the fridge. He says while DoorDashing, he had been eating on the go and hadn't cooked or eaten anything at home.

I ask why he hadn't even bothered to at least sweep, and he says he couldn't find our broom. I find the broom in less than 30 seconds of being home. And of course, I get to cleaning.

Months go by and we are once again gearing up for the winter holidays. He sets another outrageous budget, and I tell him he needs to lower that budget as we really do not need to be spending $500 per kid and $1500 on each other. I tell him that's way too much and to go lower. We agree on $300 for the kids combined and $500 on each other max.

We open presents and I discover that he has decided to spend $3000 on me. He bought me a nice camera, a stuffed animal, two gaming consoles, several video games, and a bunch of skincare items I was low on. The consoles and the games are more for him though, as they were games from his childhood and I tell him all the time that I don't want anything gaming-related for gifts. Anyway, I'm happy about the camera but also see the irony in being stuck inside the house at all times. I look forward to using the camera for trips that will likely never happen, but I hope anyway.

The new year rolls around and we are in a decent place. We aren't thriving, but we aren't fighting either. A few months go by, April 2025 now. It seems like we're in a good spot for the first time in our entire marriage. Then, he calls me from work one night and tells me that somebody stole his backpack out of his car (he never locks it, despite me telling him he needs to.) The police station called him and told him they found his backpack and he'd like me to go pick it up for him.

I go pick up the backpack from the station and they ask me to make sure everything is there. I tell them I am relieved to see the iPad wasn't stolen, but that a PlayStation handheld was stolen. They can't do much about it, and I'm sent home.

I remember seeing on the internet that sometimes an Apple device will take a front camera picture if an incorrect passcode is entered too many times. I open the iPad hoping to find a picture of the thief, and instead, it is already open on an iMessage thread with an unsaved number. 

I immediately discern it's the ""abusive"" ex again, because she has messaged asking ""Why do you always email me for my number? Why not just save it?"" and he has responded with, ""I don't save it so I won't succumb to temptation.""

Without prompt or preamble, his next messages immediately launch into a life update that reveals he had another woman in his life when I was out of state. He tells this ex that the girl he met that he was interested in and who was clearly interested in him, did not work out, because him having a wife and kids that were not separated yet was ""baggage."" He then says he did run into her a couple of months back at the movie theater, and they briefly caught up before parting ways again.

I call him to confront him, because I'm shaking with anxiety and hurt and rage. He sighs when I tell him I see he's been talking to his ex again. He says, ""Yeah?"" And when I tell him how I was hoping to find a picture of the thief and found this instead, he proceeds to disdainfully say that he bets I immediately went looking for messages and photos. 

I read the first part of the message about the other woman and ask him who she is. He said he met her in a coffee line when he was working a second job at the mall two years ago. I ask him if he approached her or vice versa. He said he saw her, thought she was cute, and started talking to her, eventually asking for her number.

He tells me they only met each other twice physically and texted for only a week. But how can I take his word for that? I never saw any messages between the two of them. He tells me he doesn't know her last name or have her number anymore. I don't know what she looks like. 

He says they only met twice and they never saw each other again. I tell him, ""that's a lie."" He insists it's not, so I read more of the message about how he saw her at the movie theater just last year, for Wicked. He tells me he saw her but they didn't interact. So I tell him again, ""You are lying to me,"" and read the next part of the message where he tells his ex that they briefly caught up before parting ways. He sighs and when I ask him to admit that he's lying in real time, he pauses for a long while and tells me he didn't lie, he just ""accidentally forgot.""

I tell him I don't know who he is, and have never known him apparently. I tell him I am no longer able to believe a single word he says. That we are over and we need to look into divorce or separation now. 

He starts sobbing and begging me, telling me to ""put it in the past"" and to ""hit the reset button."" I tell him I can't do it again, I can't do it anymore. I'm done with him romantically. That I'm so betrayed, and hurt, and angry, and sad. That I can't live like this every day anymore because it affects how I behave around our children. It affects my mood and I'm trying to mother.

I hang up with him and when he comes home, he's once again immediately sobbing and pleading with me. I tell him to get it together because our house is tiny and we can't do anything out of earshot of the kids. I tell him we have to figure out how to move forward and what steps to take.

He's insisting that I stay with him, even if not in a romantic sense. That financially, it would ruin both of us to separate and live apart in this economy. That it would traumatize the kids further, especially if the near 2 year old had to suddenly go to daycare with strangers and also live in two separate homes. He has taken steps to get me in therapy and to try to get me enrolled in college so I can earn a degree.

Part of me wonders if it is better that I stay in the same home, and get my degree and raise our kids together until they are both school-aged and I can think about a part-time or full-time job. It seems better in my mind, but is it worse? I have wanted therapy for over a decade (I had a very traumatic childhood) and finally it is within my reach. I have wanted a degree my whole life and I know I'd probably have to forego it if we separate and I have to get a job to pay for another place and bills and a vehicle and so on.

I'm not trying to sound awful here, and I feel awful even considering staying for financial purposes, but I'm at a loss. I'm scared because I have no money of my own, no savings anymore, no resume, no network, no support system, and I don't want to hand my toddler over to a stranger, especially in our area because I have heard awful, horrible things having worked in a facility.

I am scared and I am also so tired of abandoning myself for the sake of others. I feel like I always make the wrong choice and I am terrified of messing up my kids' lives by making another wrong choice.

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend — I’ll call him George — and I’m starting to question whether I handled it the right way, or if I’m being too sensitive.

George and I met through my university’s library and got along quickly. I eventually opened up to him about some really personal stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. At the time, I felt I could trust him.

Things shifted when he brought me to his church group. I liked it at first, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations — mostly pro-Trump stuff — even after I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics. George kept pressing me, asking if my views were just “inherited from my dad,” and wouldn’t drop it even when I said I didn’t want to talk about it.

I told him his comment about my beliefs being inherited from my dad wasn't appreciated and asked for an apology. Instead of addressing it, he refused to apologize over text and told me the friendship was basically over after some back and forth over text. I still agreed to meet in person the same day and even bought him a coffee, hoping to smooth things over. Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was trying to drag him down to my level, and that I was “sounding like the devil.” He also tried to pray over me, which I declined. He told me he still wants me to come to church and then told me to get up and hug him to which I declined and extended my hand to shake. I left feeling belittled and humiliated, so I walked away and ended the friendship via text.

Since then it's been about 4 months, I’ve distanced myself from the church group and anyone connected to him. But here’s where it gets more uncomfortable: I saw him at the library the other day. When I got up from my seat, I noticed he was sitting two rows ahead of me, with his back to me. Later, after I came back from getting a drink of water, I saw that he’d moved a couple rows forward — this time directly facing me.

His brother also randomly removed me on Social Media, and George has been acting like nothing happened — giving me fist bumps and saying ""what's up Jakob"". A couple of his friends have reached out, but I haven’t said much — just that I’ve been busy.

Now, I feel like he's painting me out in a negative light since I've received texts once in a while from different members of the church asking me to come and I just say I appreciate them reaching out but I'm busy.

AITA for cutting him off completely or should I just move on and let it be? His friends have completely stopped reaching out now.",1,1747590806.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

(A short disclaimer: I am sorry if I hurt someone, it’s not the intention of the post) 

I am a 26 year old woman living in a big city in Germany. I am neither a traditional person or a feminist (at least not for western women) but I hate being a woman so much. I don’t hate men but honestly I am pretty jealous of them. I am aware of their struggles it’s not like I am wearing some rose tinted glasses, I just wish I had their abilities. As a woman I feel very useless and inferior everyday. I ask myself if there is something that makes women useful besides our bodies. I wonder if I am really just an incubator and that’s it. I don’t experience the advantages of being a women like the so called emotional intelligence. I acknowledge it’s there to understand a baby better that can’t communicate yet, but you only use this skill for a short amount of time and the rest of your life it only causes problems. People say women are better in communication and their strength is their bonding but actually I am very bad at this and I feel very pathetic when I talk about my deepest thoughts and emotions, even with a psychologist. Often I can’t even say the word „feel“ out loud. Besides my sister, I don’t even have friends in this city I could talk to if I wanted to and the relationships with my friends from my hometown are not that deep. It would be really strange if I would call one of them and vice versa. Sometimes I went out with my sisters friends and I had the feeling I constantly played a role. I found it really weird that a lot of them were so loud, laughed about every little thing and smiled at me even though I said nothing. And these horrible zodiac sign conversations and the assumption that I would also believe in this. Besides that they are nice and I don’t hate them but I don’t feel very comfortable or even free to make a joke I would really laugh about. Actually I kind of feel a bit disgusted when I am in a group of women. Good for them if they have fun but I feel these conversations are meaningless and I don’t trust them and could be actually pretty scared of two or more women, especially when they are teenagers. In school I experienced some bullying of girls, maybe it’s because of that. Or maybe it’s because of the instinct driven rivalry between women. (Also a thing I hate nature for) 
I know I have feminine traits and I hate all of them. I just complaint about being not able to show some black humor, but sometimes I can’t take a joke against women. Maybe it’s because I think there is some truth in it and it constantly reminds me of that. The emotionality of us might also play a part in that. Apropos, I also hate being triggered way more easily than a man and I have to concentrate for hours to calm down (I admit I have an anger problem and haven’t found regulation tactics that worked for me, besides hurting myself). Besides the biological part I have the feeling that women are in the position to be easily laughed about for their feelings. When I want to solve something people would tell I overreact although it makes for me perfect sense why I feel the way I feel. I get that it could be overwhelming for another person, I mean it is also overwhelming for myself but this makes shut down even more.
I also have a big fear of getting pregnant and being stuck with a child (it makes sense because I can breastfeed as a woman) but I don’t even know how to talk to a child and can’t look in their eyes. I hate my body for having an uterus and till this day I am disgusted by periods hate the pain and the hormonal swifts. I hate the female hormones that lowers my pain tolerance although I am part of the physical weaker sex. My physical weakness is also why I will be never able to even move heavy things without asking for help. I hate asking for help, I am not a person that can easily work in a team and but my biology is designed for the opposite. And I am persevered like this. I hate it when people tell my boyfriend he has to help me or carry my bag (which sometimes only contains my phone, headphones and cigarettes) and I hate it when people just take things away from me to help although I didn’t asked, like I am disabled. For example when I did my coffee table and sanded it, my brother took the sanding machine away from me and said „let me do this sweetie“, although I wanted to make this table because I have fun at crafting and wanted to train my skills and learn new ones to be proud of. But how can I be proud as a woman? Men are better in everything important. I can train as much as I want, I will always be worse than the average man because he will always be stronger. (The feeling that every man is stronger than you is btw a really scary feeling and there is nothing I can change about that). Men can build things, are not blinded by emotions, they are strong, have better reflexes, hand eye coordination, are less likely to be manipulated by media, can handle loneliness better, are not easily triggered etc. even the best chefs in the world are men. People say women are more creative, then why are the inventors of everything in the world men? They say women are better with words and men better with numbers. But when I look at the statistics: women are SLIGHTLY better with words, it’s like 60/40 while men are significantly better with numbers, like 70/30. Like I said I am just an incubator. I only have my body. And I know when I go outside, my body is looked at (ofc not by the majority). The first time a man commented my ass was when I was 13, and following similar situations won’t help. I want to be able to go out without a man, I understand my boyfriends fears but it is unfair, just because I am in that body. I think I should stop here, thank you for reading if you made it this far. ",1,1747590693.0,depression,0,0.99,False
1kppxn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1kppxn7/37_days_and_unexpected_relapse_jezebel_attacks/,"37+ days and unexpected relapse (Jezebel attacks, family members, lost friends)","**Hey guys, just wanted to share my recent experience with you about my journey.**

I discovered semen retention in October 2024 and started practicing it little by little.

Before that, I was addicted for over 20 years, probably relapsing every two or three days.

Recently, I completed a streak of 37+ days. For me, the first three weeks are usually the easiest—but then something mystical always starts happening.

After 21 days, the same two birds flew to my balcony two days in a row. It felt like after a certain point, God allows the devil to test you.

Personally, I get triggered by a specific type of woman and certain locations around Los Angeles. On Day 24, the attacks got so intense that I saw the same type of woman appear *six times* in different places. I work from home, and I usually keep my windows covered—because if I see a pretty girl by the pool, I get tempted to go there, talk to her, and that’s how it all begins.

My first major urge came on Day 24 because of loneliness. I opened Bumble—then quickly deleted it. But it all started with *harmless looking.* That was the seed. When I get triggered or feel lonely, I tend to go to a specific area of LA and start walking around, talking to women, hoping for a same-day hookup.

It hypnotizes my mind, and I lose track of time. Around Day 30, I went back to that area. For a few days, nothing happened. But on the third day, I shared some of my creative work with my mother, and she made a strange, critical comment about my face. That hit me deeply. I felt triggered, and even experienced a sharp pain in my head.

I was prepared for this streak—I was doing cold showers, daily prayers, everything. But that one phrase from my mom felt like the final blow.

Eventually, I met a girl. We grabbed coffee, and later that day, we had an experience at my place. At the time, it felt thrilling—like an adrenaline rush. Everything seemed cool. But the next day, I had an emotional breakdown. A wave of fear, sadness, and tears came over me.

My confidence disappeared. I didn’t want to take any more risks. I just wanted to isolate and stay in my room for a few days.

On top of that after 30 days I got phone call from my ex which I didn't respond to and multiple opportunieties to get in touch with high quality woman. After the relapse they stopped replying my messages. Weird coincidence? I don't think so.

**So here’s what I’ve learned:**

Without God, this journey is almost impossible. I also discovered that **meditation is crucial**—because if you don’t *transmute* this energy, it starts *controlling* you.

During my streak, I took a few bold risks that paid off. But now, I’m starting from scratch again.

To sum it up:  
**Everything starts with harmless looking.** That’s how the process begins.

Structure your day. Don’t let yourself drift. Retention should serve a **bigger vision**—a purpose greater than just holding your seed.

After Day 21, I lost my ""why"" and developed a false sense of ego and confidence. But the truth is, the relapse came from a place of deep loneliness—the desire to be hugged, seen, and understood in a world where criticism is everywhere.

That’s been my experience so far. I hope it helps someone.

I’m open to your feedback—and would really appreciate any tools or advice that might help me hit a **60-day streak** next time.",2,1747590692.0,Semenretention,1,1.0,False

I’m 33 and based in Waterford and looking for my long term partner in crime if I’m lucky enough to find her on here.

5”11, blue eyes and I work in finance and have worked hard over the last few years and saved to be able to buy my own house for myself in recent months. I hardly ever drink bar special occasion or do drugs so that certainly has helped with making savings. I’d like to think I’m ambitious and driven career wise.

I’d like to think my greatest strengths would be honesty, empathy and dependability. I’m also a big doggo enthusiast (don’t have my own one currently nor do I have any kids either) and I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. 

I enjoy going to the cinema not sure if I’m a cinephile but certainly a movie lover and enjoy a good tv show binge too. I like going on walks and I’m trying to get back into the gym again more now that my house is finally fixed up so it’s not taking up a lot of my time as it has been recently. Trying to also get back into tennis and give paddle a go too. Enjoy game nights with friends whether it’s board, card, video so fair to say I can be a bit nerdy too. Enjoy going to comedy shows, theatre and sporting events as sports would be one of my passions too.

Hoping to find someone that loves to travel as I get 40 days off a year and always open to suggestions on places to go or things to do for fun and I also travel a bit for work at times (normally Kilkenny) so don’t mind travelling outside Waterford either to grab a coffee, meal etc. and see if we vibe.

1kppvd1,https://i.redd.it/eaatl74wvk1f1.jpeg,Banana Pancakes with Maple syrup cocktail air.,"Hey all, new to this sub but thought I’d share a success story I had this weekend. 

First off I’m definitely not a pro bartender although I think I’d really enjoy it, but I have a good paying full time job with tremendous benefits, and is really pretty much stress free and easy. So much so that doesn’t pay to leave to pursue other things. But if I did I’d love to be a chef and/or mixologist/bartender. 

I’ve dabbled a bit in making fun cocktails and enjoy attempting to recreate some that I have when out to eat. A while back I went to a place that had house margarita with ‘salty air’ on top. I thought this was super clever and a fun trick and have always wanted to replicate it. So, naturally, one takes to the internet to figure out how to do it. Everything I came across largely suggested using soy lecithin powder to create stable bubbles and cocktail air. Ok, order some on Amazon. It shows up and we go to work trying to re-create cocktail air. It foamed up nice at first but after a few brief seconds the foam would pop and lose 80% of the bubbles. Tried a few different things (ratio of powder, different amount of air added via aerator etc) nothing solved it. So back to the internet, naturally. A bit more digging put me on sucrose esters. Back to Amazon, a bit more pricey but we’re down the rabbit hole now and going to see it through. They arrive two days later and I get right back to experimenting. Didn’t take long to know I’d done it and had the end product I was looking for. 

With the technique perfected now I planned for a weekend party with a few friends. Decided to try a new cocktail recipe I had come across called Banana Pancakes. It called for egg whites for a nice foam but I opted to omit those and make a maple syrup air. The result was terrific. Rave reviews at the party. Friend even kept my aerator and leftover maple air solution to use in their coffee the next morning. So much fun doing this stuff on weekends!

1kppulj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kppulj/aita_for_going_lowcontact_with_my_mother/,AITA for going low-contact with my mother?,"While I know Charlotte likes them thick & juicy, I still apologise for how lengthy this may be.

So, my (29F \[30 in October\]) conservative Christian mother (52F \[53 in October\]) has used me as her therapist as well as emotional punching bag for, quite literally, as long as I could remember; & even projected her childhood trauma onto me as young as 5-6 years old (telling me about how she was in-&-out of foster care until she met my grandfather/her bio dad \[83M, passed 30 September 2024\] who got custody of her after he came back from Vietnam when she was 8 years old, & how she supposedly saved her older sister from r\*pe by throwing a pot of hot coffee onto her mother's boyfriend when she was 7), among other horrific things NO CHILD SHOULD'VE HEARD HER FUCKING PARENTS TELL HER ABOUT.  
Up until recently, I was nothing but supportive of my mother & let her vent to me whenever she needed (big mistake)--even after I had moved out of state & had my own issues & trauma to deal with (which she was 100% aware of).  
However, after 6 years of therapy (& after learning my own learned behaviours from her have caused issues in my own marriage), I've come to realise that my mother is a closeted narcissist who has become codependent on me.  
I've come to realise my entire childhood was based on HER feelings & what made HER happy; & it STILL persists to this day, despite me being across the entire country from her.  
There were even instances 6 years ago (& persisting to this day) where she would call me once or twice EVERY SINGLE DAY--I have 4 different anxiety disorders & I HATE phone calls, REGARDLESS as to who they come from... Tried setting that boundary with my mother, only to be met with ""but I'M the MOMMA, so I'm SPECIAL!"" & if she were to respect those boundaries, it'd be less than a week before she'd text me, ""I haven't called you in awhile! I'm doing good!"" like she expected me to praise her for respecting my fucking wishes--respecting my wishes solely for a pat on the back is a MASSIVE red flag.

Back in January, my horribly abusive Uncle/my mother's younger half-brother passed away. My uncle's ex/baby momma, Brandy (whom I am relatively close with & still consider an aunt) messaged me soon after his death to ask if my mother was okay, because Brandy was worried my mother was on drugs.

I texted my mother asking why the hell Brandy is saying these kinds of things to me, only for my mother to say ""All I did was pray for her!""  
Which lead me to call my mother & have a discussion where I told her Brandy has an ungodly amount of religious trauma from her abusive Jehovah's Witness parents, & my mother's """"prayers"""" only triggered Brandy & hurt her--I had told her to PLEASE consider other people & to also consider what might be comforting for her can be distressing for others.  
  
I legit thought I got through to my mother & made her understand that day--only for her to text me THE VERY NEXT DAY screenshots of her & Brandy's conversation (including the tiny little note that stated my mother blocked her!) while saying ""I did nothing wrong!!!"" except she literally spouted religious BS towards Brandy & acted like SHE was the victim when Brandy didn't accept my mother's fanaticism with open arms.

That right there was the straw that broke the camel's back for me--I was so disgusted with & disappointed in my mother that I had no idea how to respond to her anymore, & went low-contact with her.  
Her texts to me since then have been guilt-trips & attempts at character assassinations--which proved my point.

A few days ago, I go to send her a voice message to explain why I'm not responding to her, only to find out that she blocked me... Something I'd never imagine she'd do. I was literally her best friend & confidant my entire life. The fact she'd rather guilt-trip & block me, than apologise for her behaviour speaks more volumes than I ever wanted to imagine.

Because I was the only one there for my mother during every horrible thing going on in life, I can't help but feel like I'm TA for basically leaving my mother to her own devices.

So, I'm geniunely desperate for other input--AITA for going low-contact with my narcissist mother, despite the fact she'd rather block me than apologise for her actions & how they affected my upbringing & current life?

I'll happily provide more context if needed, but right now, I'm just trying to process the fact that my mother actually blocked me...

There was a time 2 years ago, where she was so upset that she wasn't allowed to speak to me for 2 weeks (due to my ""I hate phone calls regardless as to who they're from"" boundary), she called me multiple times until I answered & literally nagged me ""WHY HAVEN'T YOU ANSWERED ME!?! I AM YOUR MOTHER & I AM ALLOWED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU!!!"" to where I said ""Do you even want a relationship with me?"" to which she responded ""Not now, I don't!"" so I hung up on her. 5 minutes later, she calls me back sobbing about how she's so sorry, which had me sobbing & also apologising, despite the fact I did nothing wrong. That's the gist of how our relationship has been since I moved out at 17 years old.

I always thought my mother & I were close up until this point, so I genuinely have no idea where to go from here... Part of me feels like I'll be filled with immensely painful regret if she passes away while our relationship is strained like this (she has several autoimmune diseases & used those as an excuse to fear-monger me into doing what she wanted--""If you don't rinse those dishes off before washing them, they'll get moldy & I'll die if I eat off them!!! Do you want that!?!""--I'm allergic to mold, but I have yet to die from exposure from it)....

I'm so sorry for how long this is & I genuinely don't care if this ends up in one of Charlotte's videos, I just desperately need reassurance that I'm either doing the ride thing or that I should just find a way to speak to my mother & mend this rift....",1,1747590481.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.99,False

No news for hours but in the evening I hear her come home around 9 p.m. and come out at 10 p.m. while passing in front of the door because I am in the middle of the corridor and she lives at the end. 24 hours later still nothing but I hear her coming home at the end of the day and there is total silence. I didn't ask her anything except to have a coffee to chat quietly and stay on good terms, she takes the liberty of coming to my house, giving me her number without me asking, encouraging me to call her, she even tells me that she's really happy to have a coffee with me and in the end ghosts me without any explanation. My question is why did she give me her number herself, why did she tell me not to hesitate to call her so that in the end I don't pick up and tell me that she will call me back so as not to do it? What is the purpose of asking me to call him to ghost me tomorrow, knowing that I am his neighbor?",1,1747590408.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

So today; after much thought, and many deleted/drafted post. 

I step out from the shadow to reveal myself. Born anew from the ashes of my “yesterdays”; I am finally fully me again.

I’m sure you’re scratching your head or curious to where or what was my journey thus far had been to make such a statement.

Perhaps this will lead you to message me but before that let’s get some things sorted.

Me: single father of one boy. The woman who is my child’s mother, we have a respectful relationship that will never come to reconciliation but remain adults working together to provide what we can to our child.

That relationship ended 1 year and a few months ago. I am emotionally available and am now looking for suitors. 

I’m 5’11-6’0 ft tall, weigh between 205-215lbs, spent that last 10 or so years working manual labour jobs and warehouse work. I’m in shape and have been told I’m handsome. I often turn heads in public. No bragging, just stating facts.

I’m intelligent, funny, and down to earth. My strengths are my wit, my grin and my love for others.My weaknesses are; a nice ass, someone who can match my energy, and coffee.

Currently in a transition part of my life, as I am applying to return to school to become an electrician in the near future. Spent the last 5-6 months getting my head right and setting realistic goals/expectations. Feeling like I’m in a pretty good space. 

Anyhow if this story catches your eye, shoot me a message. I’m open to answer most questions within reason.

But sorry, now is the perfect time to talk honestly about coffee competitions.

Coffee championships are Christmas for the industry. The veterans know Santa isn't real. But they keep the act alive because the kids still believe. That belief powers a multi-million dollar machine.

Let's be honest: it's Coffee's Got Talent. New season. New hopefuls. One gets famous. The rest disappear. No one remembers last year's finalist. Or the year before that. It's not about finding the best. It's about manufacturing a star. A tour-ready mascot for brands. Next year? Repeat.

Real Champions Win Repeatedly. Not Once.

Tiger. Jordan. Messi. Federer. Gretzky. They won year after year. In coffee? You win once, then vanish. Then you reappear as a ""coach,"" ""consultant,"" or ""ambassador."" That's not a competition. That's a conveyor belt.

Who Really Benefits? Just follow the money...

Judges often pay to judge others. Think about that. They invest in judging because the return is massive: ""World Championship Certified Judge"" on their business card. Unlike competitors, judges return year after year. They build careers judging others without ever competing themselves. All prestige, no risk.

Coffee shops get genius-level employee retention. Hospitality turnover is 70-100% annually, but tell a barista they can compete? They'll stay put for 1-2 years. Competition cycles are annual. Switching jobs kills momentum. The shop ""invests"" with practice time and equipment. The barista feels obligated and committed. They tolerate low wages longer. It's golden handcuffs that cost almost nothing.

Equipment brands play a perfect numbers game. Give free gear to 10 competitors globally. Only one needs to win. Suddenly their $300 grinder is ""World Championship Equipment."" No one remembers what losers used. The return? Astronomical. One winner equals years of premium positioning. The other nine sponsorships? Complete write-offs. It's not about finding great equipment. It's about creating marketing narratives.

The Specialty Coffee Association needs these competitions. Without them? Just another boring trade group. With them? They're the Olympic Committee of coffee. They make the rules, certify the judges, and define what ""good coffee"" means. The entire ecosystem funnels money back to the association through membership fees, educational programs, judge certifications, ticket sales, sponsorships, and media attention. Without competitions, what authority would they have? Very little.

What's Actually Being Tested?

Not skill. Not depth. Not knowledge. Just this: Can you brew three pour-overs at once? Can you memorize a script about sustainability? Can you come up with some new pseudo-science that hasn't been used in recent memory?

Everyone uses the same beans, same ratios, same storylines.

Let's examine the champion's routine (sorry George): He measures water temperature: 96°C in kettle, lower in spout, 80°C in steel cup. Revolutionary science? Not really. Pre-rinse your paper filter with hot water (like every home brewer does) and you've solved George's ""problem.""

Most people brew into lightweight plastic, not heavy metal. Apply a tiny bit of scrutiny and logic and the entire routine falls apart.

Why It Keeps Going?

People crave hierarchy. We want someone to tell us what's good. Competitions manufacture that illusion. They don't reveal mastery. They package it.

Baristas enter because it feels like the only way up. They don't have money to open cafés. No leverage to start brands. Competitions are their shortcut to visibility. It's a lottery where one wins—and dozens lose. Notice who doesn't compete? People with power. People with options. They already have what the competitors are chasing.

Competitions exist to preserve power. They don't elevate talent—they extract it. They don't spread knowledge—they recycle it. They don't reward skill—they reward compliance.

So the next time you hear ""World Barista Champion,"" remember: They're just this year's kid who got promoted to Santa.",4,1747590068.0,pourover,1,0.75,False

Quiet by Nature, Fierce in Passion:
I’m the kind of guy who thrives in the quiet spaces-whether that’s the dim glow of my monitor late at night or the heavy, slow riffs of a doom/stoner metal track echoing in my headphones. Social crowds aren’t my scene; I’m more about meaningful moments than surface-level noise. If you’re someone who understands that silence can be comfortable, and that sometimes the loudest things are felt, not heard, we might just get along.

Night Shift Watchkeeper & Digital Explorer
By day (or rather, night), I’m a security officer keeping watch when the world slows down. It’s a job that demands focus and calm-qualities I carry into my gaming and life. When the shift quiets, I dive into RPGs and co-op adventures on my Steam Deck, escaping to worlds where strategy, teamwork, and exploration matter more than flashy PvP kills. Think Valheim, Monster Hunter, Elder Scrolls-games where survival and story intertwine.

Gaming & Metal: My Two Realms
Gaming fuels my imagination; metal fuels my soul. My playlist runs from the crushing riffs of stoner, doom, and grunge metal to synthwave and indie rock for those rare lighter moments. Lyrics that cut deep and music that tells a story-that’s what I live for. If you can appreciate a killer guitar solo as much as a perfectly executed raid, we’re already on the same wavelength.

Creating in Quiet Corners
I’m quietly creative-sketching when inspiration strikes, slowly learning guitar to complement my modest piano skills. It’s not about perfection; it’s about expression. Music and art are my ways of making sense of the world, one riff or brushstroke at a time.

Seeking Simplicity & Something Real
I don’t need fireworks or chaos-I want steady. Coffee on the porch, a shared playlist, a co-op quest completed side-by-side. Life’s simple moments, lived deeply, are where I find meaning. If you’re looking for a partner who values honesty, respect, and the kind of connection that grows stronger with time, let’s talk.

Please excuse any grammar issues…writing on a phone. 
I really need advice. For context me F(43) is married to an incredible man M(53) we have a sweet daughter if 2. Things have not been easy the last couple of years, extremely serious health issues with ongoing care, that prevents us from being social or having family and friends in our home. 
We recently had to host my SIL and BIL due to a family member’s passing. Organizing all of it has fallen to my husband and I. We agreed to let SIL and BIL stay while we complete the necessary EOL issues. The basement is the only option for them staying with us as my husband has no immune system and a cold could kill him. Anyone who visits must mask in our home. 
We have a basement area that is very nice and empty, now that our son is away at uni. It has a bathroom, kitchen and basics. It has a bed but is otherwise empty. 
I cleaned it well and we put some nice camp chairs in there but no real furniture. The issue started yesterday when SIL suggested we furnish the basement with things from the passed family member. I said no, as the space will be rented eventually and don’t want to move it all out again. 
I work 6 days a week.. as a full time professional and for my husband’s business  as well. My typical day is up at 5am in bed by 11pm if my toddler is amendable… 😜
I get only day to catch up on sleep a week and this morning I was texted awake by SIL. She asked if we were up, I said no. She texted wanting coffee and towels. I had to get up and cater to her. I said that this was my only day to catch up on sleep as I made coffee, in response to her very passive aggressive… I can’t believe it’s 9 already. 
Normally, I would ignore blatant baiting. I made her two black coffees and pointed to a stack of towels and turned and walked away. 
I know I’m operating on little sleep and my emotions are not as easy to shut down but potatoes… I’m so annoyed. The audacity… most of it is the tone in which things are demanded or expected… it’s nothing I can point to specifically. 
As the host, what is my obligation to provide food, coffee, furniture to the visiting family? I feel like going and buying some cheap throw away things… plates, utensils, coffee pot and accessories. For those who have dealt with similar please advise me on things I should get, that my sleep starved brain will not think about. Thank you.

1kppkiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1kppkiq/how_to_turn_your_aigenerated_content_into_income/,How to Turn Your AI-Generated Content into Income,"Hey friends! 🌟

Ever dreamt of sitting back, sipping your coffee, and watching the cash roll in from content you didn’t even physically write? Sounds like a fantasy, right? 😏 Well, let me tell you—it’s not! With AI-generated content, you can seriously start seeing some income, and it's like having a little robot assistant buzzing around to help you work smarter, not harder. 

So, how do we turn those clever lines of text into sweet, sweet cash? Here’s a little roadmap to get you from “hey, cool blog” to “look at my passive income flow”—and I promise it’s simpler than it sounds!

### 1. **Pick Your Niche Wisely** 
   - Ask yourself: **What are you passionate about?** 
   - Go where there’s demand. Remember the last time you Googled something? If it’s getting searched, it’s likely to be *lucrative*.
   - Don’t forget to mix that passion with a bit of keyword research!

### 2. **Create Quality Content ** 
   - Your AI buddy can whip up content faster than you can say “another coffee, please!” but make sure it’s helpful. 
   - Think tutorials, how-tos, or insightful articles that not only inform but also *engage*.
   - Example: If you love gardening, maybe create a blog about “Top 10 Houseplants That Won’t Die on You.” Who wouldn’t want that info? 🌱

### 3. **Monetization Time! 💵**
   - **Ads**: Use platforms like Google AdSense. You'll earn just by placing ads on your site. 
   - **Affiliate Marketing**: Promote products and earn a commission. Just make sure it’s stuff you actually believe in! 
   - **Selling eBooks or Courses**: Turn that AI-generated content into an eBook or a course. “How to master gardening with minimal effort” could be a hit!
  
### 4. **Build Your Audience** 
   - No one wants to be a ghost town! 
   - Leverage social media like Instagram or Pinterest to drop snippets of your content and link back to your site. Create buzz—people love a good story!
   - **Engage with your audience:** Ask questions, reply to comments, and maybe throw in a meme or two. 😂 

### 5. **Repurpose Like a Pro** 
   - Got a stunning blog post? Convert that bad boy into a video for YouTube or break it down into bite-sized quotes for social media.
   - The more places you put your genius, the more dollars can roll in. 📈

### 6. **Stay Consistent and Flexible** 
   - Like anyone ever said about a good relationship, it's about *consistency* and *adaptability*! 
   - Keep tabs on what works and what doesn’t. Did a certain post blow up? Lean into that! 🤓

Turning AI-generated content into income isn’t just about writing. It’s about creativity, strategy, and engagement. Imagine running a mini content empire where you’re the boss and your AI is your right-hand robot. Sounds exciting, right? So, what’s holdin’ you back? Have any of you tried monetizing your content, or are you just dipping your toes in?

I've been with my bf for over 7 years now. We ""live  together"" but not really. It's my apartment, he never wanted to rent, he'd be perfectly happy living with his parents... at 40 years old. (A huge turnoff for me). He previously had his own place but sold it.  He stays with me, living out of a bag even though he had closet space and dresser drawers he won't use. I make him pay me rent money now. I've recently started therapy and I feel even worse about our relationship. 

For starters, we recently had a fight about how much time he actually spends with me. We both work part-time jobs, neither of those jobs are keeping us from having a dinner together every night, which is what I want. However, he always chooses to eat with his parents instead. He is a mama's boy. I've tried to get past this by thinking that their relationship is so close because he is an only child. He is also a spoiled rotten only child. He has never had to want in his life. He's never paid his own phone bill courtesy of his mother. Recently, when his taxes were due along with his car insurance, his mother wrote him a check. 

On days that he needs to work, he gets up and goes to his parents' house first. He says he either needs supplies or he wants coffee when we are out. Then he goes to work. When he gets off work he goes back to his parents' house. And his mother will always have food waiting for him. So he eats with his parents. Then eventually he will come home to me, where I have been waiting for him since I got off work, to have dinner. He'll say he's not hungry. I will eat alone. The next day I will not wait for him and I will eat dinner alone again. Then he will be upset that I didn't make food for him too, even though I know he has already ate with his parents. No matter how I try, I always end up eating dinner alone. 

I also have ulcerative colitis. I have been very ill for the last 3 years. Trying to get into remission, it has been a miserable experience, and I have suffered mentally physically and emotionally with it. I only eat my own meals because any type of food outside of my strict diet will make me very sick. Anytime I willingly go to his parents' house to work in our garden (it's part of our summer income to sell veggies at markets. The garden is on his parents property.) I always end up feeling trapped there for dinner time. My boyfriend knows that I can't eat their food, and when I insist that we go home to eat our own dinner, he says that he ""can't pass up a free meal' from his parents. So a lot of the time I end up sitting with him and his parents watching them eat food that I cannot have. This is uncomfortable for me, also i'm starving, and his parents cannot seem to understand why I can't eat their food. I feel like i'm being very rude as well. I've expressed this concern a thousand times to him. This last time that it happened, I absolutely put my foot down and told him absolutely not. Prior to going to his parents' house, I made it an unbreakable condition that we eat dinner at our house together. Not with his parents. He aggreed. Guess what happened? He ate with his parents. As soon as we left, we had that fight. I told him I didn't feel like a priority to him. I told him that I was lonely and sick of being alone for dinner every night. I told him that i don't feel like he's my partner because we don't spend any time together. He said that he didnt think it was a big deal and that I should have told him sooner because im overreacting now. This only infuriated me further, as I HAVE told him this multiple times. 

Since then he has been having dinner with me. I've tried to let this feeling in my stomach go, but I still feel so off with him. Everything changed when i got sick. Ive spent weeks and weeks at a time in the hospitals for years now. I feel like he doesn't want to care for me when im ill. He would call my mom, which is a HUGE HELL NO for me since we don't have a good relationship, and my mom would come sit with me. Or my aunt. Or my grandma. Or my sister. They would all come willingly to sit by my side in the hospital. But he would complain. He would say stuff to make me feel like more of a burden. Then tell me what I did wrong to end up there in the first place. He wasnt there for me when I needed him most. When I was rushed in an ambulance, He didnt get in with me. When I was receiving potassium through my IV, burns like hell, very painful, he wasnt there. When I was being transported for a CT scan and left alone in a hallway crying in pain, He wasnt there. When I was coughing up blood, He wasnt there. Any procedures, Not there. 

When he was there, during my last stay. They finally allowed me to eat after two weeks of only water and broth.  I asked him to bring me a simple home-cooked meal for me. The hospital food would have ruined me further. He knows my safe foods. He knows what would be easiest for me to eat. What did he bring me...A spicy curry chicken with rice. I hate curry. I cannot do spicy food. I cannot tolerate rice. He made it because that is what he wanted to eat. So he brought me that in the hospital, im down 10lbs from starving myself, and he ate that food in front of me. I was so mad I was crying. He didnt seem fazed. 

Now to date, his parents are going out of town for two weeks. He says he needs to house-sit for them. I don't understand what that means. Seeing as he is at his parents' house every single day.No matter what. He says he has to watch over their cat, the cat is an outdoor cat. She needs her food and water filled once a day. And then there's the garden to look after, but we also look after that multiple times a week as is.  He has decided that he wants to stay at his parents' house while they are gone because it's more convenient for him to feed the cat. He will not be home with me for two weeks. 

I feel like he doesn't want to be home with me at all. He knows I don't like the idea of this and yet he isn't even wanting to compromise.  I'm holding on to so much resentment, and i was trying to be hopeful that having dinners together again could bring us back together. But I also feel like the damage from the last few years has been done, and I can't forgive that. He says he loves me and he wants our relationship. But I don't feel any of that from him. His actions say otherwise. So I can't help but to put up my emotional walls to spare myself from being hurt. 

I don't understand why he can't have boundaries with his parents, and make me a priority for once. It's been over 7 years. I feel like it's too much. He will always choose them over me. He doesn't see me.  He doesn't value me. 

I don't know what to do or think or feel. And my therapist has only made me feel worse. Im looking to seeing a different one. But I'm at a loss either way. ",1,1747589587.0,u_Casper_cass,0,1.0,False

In short, the psychologist told me not to take ADHD medication the day of my autism evaluation. She said that for insurance purposes, the evaluation has to include dual testing, and she wants to test for ADHD (which I currently have a diagnosis for). She told me to bring my medication with me but did not indicate the circumstances I would take it (if at all). The doctor also said we would start with the ADHD testing first, and that it would be a computer based assessment, before moving on to the autism portion of the evaluation. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD about 6 years ago by a psychiatrist via interview format and have been prescribed medication ever since then. To be entirely honest, I struggle to get out of bed without my meds due to heavy fatigue. My dosage is on the high end so brain fog is really intense if I skip. I don’t ever take full breaks but I try to half my IR in the afternoon whenever I can. I take my XR every morning.

I’m supposed to drive a bit over 1 hour for this evaluation. Then it’s about 3-4 hours of rigorous testing, before the 1 hour drive home. On one hand, I understand wanting to test while I’m unaffected by medication, and accurate results are of the utmost importance to me! However, I also feel like being completely unmedicated might cause unnecessary strain and possible inaccuracies due to the intensity of brain fog. I’m also not supposed to drink coffee or anything else that day, so it’s ‘au natural’. Ahhh!

Friends, I’m stressed! I’m really dreading “raw dogging” this evaluation. Should I try to power through unmedicated for the best evaluation results? Has anybody been in this situation before? ",1,1747589549.0,adhdwomen,5,0.67,False

Battery had died so had to be jumped, which was the first red flag (battery is a 2 year old everstart). So I jumped it and let it idle for maybe 30 minutes before taking it around the town on a brief loop. No issues. I drove it to work today to see if I could get the problem to manifest…which it did in a drive through waiting for coffee. The power steering went completely and then the engine started to hard idle before dying completely. My buddy came to jump me & the car would start right up upon turning the key over, but if I let it idle off the jump cables, it would die. If I put it into gear and tried to drive it, the power steering would go out and the car would die again. 

Any ideas? Alternator? Serpentine belt? Power steering module under steering wheel?

The dashboard does display a CEL and the red battery warning indicators, so I’ll probably go and replace the battery this evening after work just to get it home (hopefully)

1kppeb2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kppeb2,ZONING your OWN Space?!?,"Gentlemen, Ladies, and all the amazing minds out there, 

I humbly come to ask for your opinions, professional suggestions, ideas and feedback on my current living space and how you would modify the area to optimize comfort and flow. Thank you.

  
I used the IKEA Kreativ tool, for the 3D renders since its free and I have multiple furniture pieces from the brand. Some of the items are fillers, representing as best they can the actual items in my space linked below. In my current space, I have a few 'pain points' that I will share with you. 

1. I have an east facing window, so some days the light is intense and impacts my vision of my computer displays on the IKEA [Idasen desk](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/idasen-desk-sit-stand-brown-dark-gray-s89281011/). 
2. The Idasen desk is a sit stand but unfortunately, due to the [Ergotron monitor arms](https://www.ergotron.com/en-us/products/product-details/45-686#?color=black) sticking out and the [Bjorksta painting](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/bjoerksta-picture-and-frame-sand-dunes-black-s69508930/) on the wall (1in thick) I cannot use the stand feature. Also the [Skadis pegboard ](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-pegboard-black-50534378/#content)[accessories ](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-7-piece-accessories-set-white-20586420/#content)(5in thick) block raising the table as well, since my [tabletop PC](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1571895-REG/cooler_master_mcb_nr200_knnn_s00_nr200_small_form_factor.html/?ap=y&ap=y&smp=y&smp=y&store=420&smpm=ba_f2_lar&lsft=BI%3A5451&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21413748443&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiqbBBhCAARIsAJSfZkac9fAPH-ApYylmsiABkrGHTgXA5md0LVG9K7GUzXhnzJyXIQmTS6YaAvn1EALw_wcB) will bump into it. 
3. The [Trofast storage combo](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/trofast-storage-combination-with-boxes-gray-white-gray-s59574949/) next to the Idasen desk sticks out 1.25in past the 75in wall. 
4. While sitting at the Idasen desk, I feel like the [Eket bookshelf](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/eket-wall-mounted-cabinet-combination-walnut-effect-white-s49490323/#content) is encroaching my space while sitting at the desk.
5. I feel like my [Burrow Range sofa](https://burrow.com/range-fabric/2-piece-one-arm-sofa?sku=FLRST-SF-RG-S2-A1-C0-MG-DW&table-add-on=FLRSTB-RG-1-WNDW) is too far from my [65in LG G2 TV](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65g2pua-oled-4k-tv) or vice versa (laser from edge of sofa is 9ft 5in to the tv wall or \~11ft from where head is in seated position.)
6. The [Burrow Serif side table](https://burrow.com/tables-and-benches/serif-side-table?sku=FLRTB-ST-SR-WN) in the corner is literally unused beside decoration of LEGO Botanicals. 

Now this all started (b/c of pts 5 & 6) when I decided to shop for a new sofa, since I realized when I'm on a sofa- I'm more of a 'lounger' than a 'sitter.' The current Burrow Range sofa seats are too shallow, and when using the arm as the back rest, your \*@ss sinks between the two cushions. Let me know what type of person you are down below, tell me straight if I'm weird haha. 

So I started leaning towards the [Herman Miller Luva ](https://store.hermanmiller.com/living-room-furniture-sofas-sectionals/luva-modular-sectional-two-seater/2560902-1.html?lang=en_US)due to the deeper seating, option to unfold for a back/head rest, and lowered arm rests. But then the price gahhh, so I'm currently set on the [IKEA Jattebo](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/planners/jattebo-planner/) because of the deeper seating, more affordable price and ITS GREEN! 💚

So I started using the planner to see if the IKEA Jattebo would in place of the old Burrow Range... 

Jattebo Seating Options

||Depth|Width|Height|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[1-seat](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/jaettebo-1-seat-module-with-storage-samsala-dark-yellow-green-s79471479/)|37 3/8 in|27 1/2 in|28 in|
|[1.5-seat](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/jaettebo-1-5-seat-module-with-storage-samsala-dark-yellow-green-s39471462/)|37 3/8 in|37 3/8 in|28 in|
|[1-seat chaise](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/jaettebo-chaise-module-right-with-armrest-samsala-dark-yellow-green-s59494575/)|63 in|37 3/8 in|38 in|
|2-seat chaise|63 in|65 in|28 in|
|2.5-seat chaise|63 in|74 3/4 in|28 in|
|Burrow Range (current sofa)|31 in|60 1/2 in|28 in|

So now the space, that window wall is 11ft 2in. Plenty of room for a chaise to be a 'lounger', right? Welp the HVAC (depicted in black) might pose a tad problem for that idea. The space between the wall and the HVAC is 62.5in (and the baseboard of 0.5in reduces that to 62in of space.) The chaise is 63in... though its memory foam and my buddy says I can squeeze it just fine. This now brings me to what I call the ""Stuffed"" and ""Unstuffed"" Sofa Layout Design. The 'stuffed' version as you see, would be in the corner and I would have the 2.5-seat chaise option for more booty wriggle room. Due to my worry of the memory foam not being pliable enough I designed the ""unstuffed sofa space"" which looks like this. Not bad right? It offers less drastic changes to the space but comes at a cost of reducing the 2.5-seat to a 2-seat chaise. And a new coffee table from the Ikea Stockholm collection!

Then realizing how fun it is to design interior, I said to myself, what if I start from a clean slate? And thus the revolutionary new vision for the space was born. In this vision, I decided to break up my large open living room area into sections or 'activity zones.'  The computer zone, the media/tv zone, and .... this zoning strategy gave way to having a place to eat! Revolutionary! Now I don't have to eat at my computer or on the couch like in the old design.

Items From Current Home, Not Fitting in New Activity Cluster Design

* Removed Coffee Table
* Removed [Burrow Serif Side Table](https://burrow.com/tables-and-benches/serif-side-table?sku=FLRTB-ST-SR-OK)
* Removed [Lack Shelf](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/lack-wall-shelf-white-50282182/)
* Removed [Mosslanda Shelf](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/mosslanda-picture-ledge-white-90292103/)
* Removed [Trofast Storage](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/trofast-storage-combination-with-boxes-gray-white-gray-s59574949/)

This new refreshing look comes with maybe its own little issues while fixing some of the ones I mentioned earlier. Here are the fixes:

1) Computer Monitor is out the sun and shouldn't get washed out. 3) Got rid of the Trofast Storage with its items moving into the Kallax Divider. 4) New space for Eket bookshelf, more open to approaching and exploring it. 5) TV is now much closer to the sofa. (78in away!) 6) Got rid of unused side table and space. The only issue not mentioned is #2 which honestly might need its own post.

Now the issues:

1. Fear of change + things not working out because with this build accuracy is key 
   1. esp. for the spacing between the sofa and tv (can't have it too close) 
   2. the spacing between the computer desk and divider (need room for chair wriggling)
2. Having to Patch/Repair & Paint all the damage from taking down the prior design
3. The Kallax Divider blocking a portion of the light (\~13.875in)
   1. Kallax is 71.625in + 0.5in baseboard = 72.125in
   2. Window from the wall starts at = 58.25in 
   3. Kallax is 71.625in tall and window starts at 26in from floor and ends at 92in
4. The lovely LG G2 TV not being wall mounted. (Maybe I can mount to the Kallax?) Never mind too heavy at 50.3lbs and the Kallax shelves only supporting 29lbs. 
5. Also, I lose space for all my LEGO Botanicals I have displaced on the media console but i guess I can put them on the Kallax and use glasses cases. 

Can't end things on a sour note, so here's some HAPPY points:

* Jattebo fits like a GLOVE on that 75in wall (could even rock 3 seats, if I forgo the armrest) but with the 1-seat + 1.5-seat +armrest it comes out to 74.875in! 💖
* Media Console is aligned perfectly with a wall outlet, so power for everything!
* I can see the sky! My back is never turned to the window 🌇

There's a few more nitty gritty things I think I want to get into, but this post is long enough already. 

  
What do you think? Would love to hear your feedback and ideas!

And honestly if you guys really like the new redesign, and if that anyone lives in NYC and loves to tinker and remodel, then I would love to work with you to do this project!

This time I'm considering a 3-week trip to Greece. I'd like to fly into Athens and spend a 2 or 3 days there. Maybe rent a car to travel to Delphi 1 day and then return to Athens to pick up a ferry or flight to visit the islands. Since I'm planning quite early, I'd like to book a hotel room/airbnb for 3 or 4 nights on 2 islands while visiting a couple islands via ferry. I am thinking Corfu, Crete or Santorini as my islands for R&R. My plan is to be a history buff tourist the first half of vacation, then relax via the beach-side the remainder before flying from Athens back to the East Coast (either NY or NJ airports).  I've been watching YouTube for tips and suggestions. The problem is most of the videos are by youngsters way younger than me. I am 61f with an interest in some hiking (maybe the Capitals?), a food tour (I don't like olives, onions, or eat much meat) but mostly relaxing and taking in the beauty that Greece has to offer. It has to be July because I am still working. Do you suggest that I reserve a hotel room or give the airbnb's a chance? Objectives needed: bed, A/C, outlets to charge my cell/cochlear, and coffee. I prob won't be renting a car after I visit Delphi. So your suggestions to get the most bang for the 3 weeks time would be awesome. Thank you in advance too!

This capsule-based supplement promised a lot, so I took it upon myself to evaluate just how well it stands up to those claims.

**A Holistic Approach to Ingredients**  
The combination of magnesium and potassium in this product is thoughtfully formulated. Both minerals are essential for maintaining cellular and tissue health. Magnesium, especially, plays a key role in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body. What really caught my attention, though, was the inclusion of taurine. Taurine is an amino acid often overshadowed in supplement formulas, yet it’s highly significant for cardiovascular and neuromuscular health. It helps regulate electrolyte and neurotransmitter balance, which is excellent for long-term wellness. I’ve been taking two capsules in the morning alongside my coffee (which, let’s be honest, might not be ideal for electrolyte balance), and I felt noticeable stability in my energy levels during intense work sessions.

**Packaging and Design in Daily Use**  
The design of the capsules and the bottle made for a hassle-free experience. The capsules are unflavored, which is a godsend if you’ve ever had to deal with the awful chalky taste from some other brands. Each bottle holds a 120-count, sufficient for nearly two months if you take the recommended two capsules daily. However, the packaging doesn’t blow you away. It’s functional and straightforward—perfectly fine for a supplement bottle but nothing that screams “premium product.” The size of the capsule is manageable, and it doesn’t leave any aftertaste, which was a relief for someone like me who’s not particularly fond of swallowing pills.

**Strengths of the Supplement**  
- The non-GMO and Kosher certifications are a big plus for those prioritizing clean ingredients.  
- A family-owned company with GMP certification ensures a high level of trust in manufacturing quality.  
- Dairy-free, egg-free, nut-free, soy-free, and gluten-free—essentially a solid option for people with dietary restrictions.  

**Shortcomings to Consider**   
- While the unflavored aspect is excellent, the capsules occasionally felt slightly dry, prompting you to gulp down more water than usual.  
- It would have been nice to know if the taurine content was tailored to specific requirements since some users might prefer a higher dosage.  
- The company could offer more in-depth sourcing information for people who are curious about where their supplements’ active compounds originate.

**Competing Brands in the Market**  
The supplement market is vast, and examining alternatives is crucial when deciding on a product. Similar magnesium and potassium-based supplements like Solaray Magnesium and Potassium Asporotate target a similar audience and offer a comparable mix of essential minerals. However, I found the NOW formula more appealing due to the added taurine. Most competitors skip taurine altogether, which is a bit of a miss considering how beneficial it can be for heart health and neurotransmitter regulation. On the other hand, other brands like Nature Made Magnesium tend to focus solely on magnesium without pairing it with potassium, making them less comprehensive but perhaps suited for someone looking for a single-focus supplement.

**Cost Efficiency in Perspective**  
Stacking up this product against its competitors, the price-to-quality ratio feels fitting. Sure, you can always find cheaper alternatives, but they are often lacking in certifications of quality or might not include complementary ingredients like taurine. For me, the potential long-term health benefits, combined with peace of mind about the clean ingredient list, made it a reasonable choice. If you’re budgeting for a quality supplement without diving into overly premium tiers, it hits that sweet spot.

I’m open to a long-distance relationship, but only with the understanding that we eventually meet. I’m not looking for something that stays online forever. Ideally, you’re someone who’s willing and able to travel , whether that means visiting me or meeting halfway.

I’m tired of connections that get stuck in the “talking stage” and never grow into something meaningful. I’m ready to be upfront and genuine from the start.

A little about me:
I’m a coffee and matcha snob, a fan of slow days and quiet moments. I enjoy both intellectual and completely nonsensical banter , anything from deep philosophical tangents to laughing about the dumbest things and sharing random thoughts throughout the day. 

Podcasts are my constant companions, and I meditate to stay grounded. I’m a creative soul with a soft spot for food, history, and film , especially the kind that makes you feel something. Basically, if you’re into cozy energy and thoughtful vibes, we might just get along.

Also for transparency: I’m on the curvy/thicc side. If that’s not your thing, no hard feelings , let’s not waste each other’s time. And I have absolutely no patience for body-shaming.

What I’m looking for:

	•	Someone emotionally available and serious about building a real connection

	•	Someone who enjoys deep conversations and long, random chats

	•	Someone who values communication, effort, and honesty

	•	Someone ready to match energy and intentions

If any of this resonates with you, send me a message with a quick intro, who you are and what you’re looking for. I appreciate sincerity over flash.

I feel better today but currently went through an intense rupture that I was so proud I worked through. I went out still and did things I love because I cannot let this awful thing take over my life anymore.


That being said, I forced myself on a small walk to the coffee shop and came home right after, first call through the door: my doctors office.

I could tell the secretary was flustered and angry for me. She said I’ve been rejected by the only two offices in my city that have specialists for my endo. My heart dropped and I asked her why.. “because they saw you already have a gynaecologist and specialists in this city won’t overstep unless they’ve recommended you to one themselves.

Only issue? I don’t have a gynaecologist anymore. I haven’t had one in 11 months.

Here in British Columbia: if you don’t see a specialist within 6 months from each appointment you are not a patient with their practice anymore. Your doctor needs to recommend you back to their practice. 

She told me one of them said they’d reconsider with proper recommendation. Which feels like such a punch in the gut.. I didn’t go back to this gyno BECAUSE it was a horrible experience. She didn’t care about my pain, my hospital history (over 10 times in the last 9 months). She just kept asking about my period and telling me to try birth control. She wouldn’t stop telling me to try it - regardless of me telling her it’s a last resort as I have bipolar 2. I’ve worked so hard on my mental health, if the birth control I take messes with my hormones I would be screwed - for months. One pill I tried sent me into psychosis. Birth control IS a last resort. I just want a confirmed diagnosis FROM A SPECIALIST.

My secretary was incredible, she empathized and told me to try and get a discharge form or email from the last clinic, I called them and they told me they don’t do that? But confirmed I am fully NOT patient at their practice.

This is all happening with a current rupture, the pain increased bigger than a 10 because of stress. I could barely walk that point.

The worst part of all? I’ve been waiting months. Months. I asked the secretary if I may have to wait another 10 months to a year and she said “it’s a possibility honey. I’m so sorry” and assured me she’s doing everything she can to fix it.

(Some info: my current family doctor is on mat leave, so this has been challenging).

She gives me hope for this world, as I’ve never felt so mentally and physically defeated before. Nobody has any idea what’s going on and I’m at a loss at what to do. What if they never take me?

Diagnosed in 2020 with admitting BS of 1,162 and a1c 14%+. Weight was 372lbs. Highest ever was 409lbs but symptoms before diagnosis brought me down to 372lbs. Left the hospital on insulin, Ozempic, and synjardy. By end of 2021 I was down to 288lbs and off all medication. A1c was 5.5%.

Little rectangles in angles

Across the wall of your favourite room

Where would you rather be?


When your child comes running through the door,

Beautiful face and sparkling eyes,

His voice alight with joy as he recounts his adventures away

Where would you rather be?


When you can feel the sand between your toes,

Taste the ice from your sangria against your lips

The sunshine on your face, bouncing off the sea

Where would you rather be?


When you're out on a rare date night,

And the clothes you chose fit just right,

Conversation flowing like water over smooth grey pebbles

Where would you rather be ? 


When you steal a quiet moment to reflect on your life,

Favourite coffee on the table and a little doughnut in hand

Where would you rather be?


I'd still rather be dead.

1kpp53g,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kpp53g/second_grinder_under_800_eur/,Second grinder under [800 EUR],"Hi!

I have an Eureka Mignon Specialita grinder, with an Ascaso Duo Plus espresso machine but I got a demand for a second grinder, because while I like the lighter roasts, my girlfriend and family members prefers the darker ones.

It's an option to buy another Mignon Specialita, but I was wondering if there are any other grinders that are worth considering and could be an upgrade under 800 EUR.
I wonder how the taste of the coffee would change with a different grinder.

The requirements are:
- I prefer a hopper that can hold around 150g of beans over the single dose option
- I should be able to program the grind time or gind by weight
- It shouldn't be too big: the max width is 25cm, while it can be taller, I still don't need a tower in my corner :)
- I would like to have a grinder that is not too noisy, or not loder than the average grinders
- Maybe a larger burr size would be better or give a bigger difference in taste than the Mignon Specialita
- I would prefer white color

Models that I was checking:
- Mahlkönig X54:
    - It's Mahlkönig, so I expect it to be good (good)
    - I could find it for around 530 EUR in white (good)
    - 54mm burrs (concern)
    - Relatively big (concern)
- Fiorenzato AllGround
  - Around 750 EUR (more expensive than the X54) (concern)
  - I don't drink filter coffee, so I don't really need the allground option (concern)
    - However maybe that will open up new options for me (good)
  - 64mm burrs (good)

Other models that I found, but I didn't spent too much time on them:
- Fiorenzato F4 E Nano
  - Around 700 EUR (good)
  - 58mm burrs (concern)
- Other Eureka models:
  - I could find Eureka Zenith Neo 65, Helios 65 HSM or Zenith 65E in the price range but I don't know if they are better than the Mignon Specialita Probably I would prefer to try another brand than Eureka, but I could be convinced

But I'm not sure if I need any new grinder, family can drink what I drink, and sometimes I can drink what they drink. So, if these options are not worth it, I would be happy to hear that too.

We’ve been together for three years, and I recently made a big life change — left my full-time job, moved across the state, left my family and friends — all to take the next step in our relationship. This is the first relationship where he ever lived with a partner (just throwing that out there for context). 

Here’s the issue: every time his parents visit, his mom acts like I’m destroying some kind of sacred bachelor museum.

Before I moved in, his place was a full-on man cave. The furniture was either random hand-me-downs from his parents, IKEA furniture, or finds from Facebook Marketplace. Think: scratched-up coffee tables, worn in bulky leather couches, no rugs, no real painting or pictures — nothing had been intentionally picked, and nothing matched.

Since moving in, I’ve made small changes — replaced his old media stand with mine, added a rug, put up some pictures from my apartment, and brought in my bedroom furniture to fill out the guest rooms. He paid for an entire new bedroom set in the master bedroom for us. I have also swapped out one ceiling fan, changed doorknobs (so they matched throughout the entire house) and sold a few worn-out pieces with my boyfriend’s full support. Nothing wild. Just trying to make it feel like a shared space.

But his mom comments on everything. She will say things like “Oh, why’d you get rid of that?” , “Why are you changing so much so fast.” But then when talks to him on the phone she’ll say things like “I’m disappointed [insert my name] didn’t want to keep this.” Even when I reframed some small hiking pictures she’d printed of him and moved them to the guest room (I got them done professionally!), she commented about moving them from the living room. 

My boyfriend says she’s just sentimental about the furniture — but it’s not her house. There was one piece of furniture that was in their family hone growing up, but we just didn’t have anywhere to put it once we reorganized the furniture in the living room. We offered to give it back to his parents, but they also didn’t have anywhere for it to go, and I had to hear about how disappointed she was about that. 

At this point I don’t entirely care what she thinks about how we decorate. AITA for not really caring about her feelings over a bunch of mismatched furniture and making the house feel like a home for the two of us?",5,1747588695.0,AITAH,13,0.86,False

Hey everyone,
I’m on the hunt for coffee roasters in Switzerland that offer South Italian-style espresso beans — the classic kind that’s dark, rich, low in acidity, and perfect for a strong, creamy espresso. Not a fan of the more modern, fruity or acidic profiles.

Until now, I’ve liked Stoll Coffee in terms of quality, but I’m wondering if there are other roasters out there (maybe more specialized or under-the-radar?) that really nail that deep, traditional southern Italian taste.

Any recommendations? Bonus points if they have locations near Zürich, Luzern, Basel Bern, !

Thanks a lot in advance!

Was running (and took an effervescent pill of electrolytes) but earlier that day had a diet coke and iced coffee. It was in the park, my stomach had a weird pain and the I started to get bloated, checked my heart rate and it was higher than usual so I guess that triggered the panic attack, felt HORRIBLE because I was running. Luckily I called someone and picked me up from the park and the I rested in my house.

The second panic attack was a week later, also running and AT THE SAME SPOT of the park.

Went to a lot of doctors, took antibiotics for SIBO (as a doctor told me) and also got heartwork done, bloodwork, etc and everything was normal!

Was in a state of high anxiety for 2 weeks, started therapy. And everything it's becoming more easy as I realized it was emotions all along.

But yesterday after 2 months went to the park, not to run but to walk (also we where on a heat wave in the city so I went at night) and again at the same spot my heart rate started to go up! But this time I was able to handle it and just rested a bit, and keep walking (i fear but walking) so it was more as an anguish attack haha. It's kind of traumatic to feel the adrenaline of the body in fear, so I guess that's why my body feels there's danger but I do my breathing work and can handle to keep going with life... it's just weird, do you think that the body is reacting to the spot in the park? or any ideas? 

I know it's and emotion behind all that but it surprises me that still happens in the park! in the same spot 😂

I’m Daniel, 20 years old and 6’ tall. I’m yearning for a connection that goes deeper than a friendship. I want to be able to call somebody my person as I hopefully will be for them! I miss the warmth that comes with having a loved on as well as simply somebody to hold close.

A little about me! I’m a very physically intimate person. So I love hugging and kissing and just laying around with you anywhere! I really love holding hands and making sure my SO is comfortable and warm. I show my love as well by doing a lot of domestic things, like laundry, dishes, breakfast and coffee brought to you! It’s those little and big things that I want to provide for you that really brings me so much joy and hopefully my partner too! Also, if I really love lying I can get a little clingy, but not be obnoxious type don’t worry!!!

As for hobbies, I’m very into working out, reading, gaming, writing and a little bit of painting hehe. My books I tow chapters in and I’m slacking a little on the third but I’m working on it!

My friends describe me as a golden retriever haha, a little nerdy and introverted, but gets really energetic when I open up! 

I’m hoping to find somebody modest, and open minded. Somebody that’d let me hold their hand as we walk to the grocery store and let me hug them when we both feel like it. Somebody that’s serious about us and our future. One where we have a family and hopefully children, as I’ve always wanted a child and of course a kind hearted and warm wife haha, I’m very in it to marry sort of person, so I hope we share those values too 🥹

If you’ve read this far, I genuinely appreciate you taking your time, but hopefully you’ll even take a risk and message me (I’m very smooth yes)! Where we can exchange pics to see if we’re both attracted to one another as well! Take care, you 🫂",1,1747588501.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

But sorry, now is the PERFECT time to expose coffee competitions.

(Yes, this is a throwaway account, for obvious reasons)

Coffee competitions aren't just misleading.

They're a SOPHISTICATED SCAM.

Not the kind where someone steals your credit card.

The kind where an entire industry tricks young baristas into burning YEARS chasing a title.

A title that benefits everyone EXCEPT them.

**The Santa Claus Effect**

Coffee championships are Christmas for the industry. The veterans know Santa isn’t real. But they keep the act alive—because the kids still believe. That belief powers a multi-million dollar machine.

**It’s Not a Championship. It’s a Talent Show.**

Let’s be honest: it’s *Coffee’s Got Talent.* 

New season. New hopefuls. 

One gets famous. The rest disappear. No one remembers last year’s finalist. Or the year before that. It’s not about finding the best. It’s about manufacturing *a star.* A tour-ready mascot for brands. Next year? Repeat.

**Real Champions Win Repeatedly. Not Once.**

Tiger. Jordan. Messi. Djokovic. Gretzky. They won year after year. 

In coffee? You win once, then vanish. 

Then you reappear as a “coach,” “consultant,” or “ambassador.” 

That’s not a competition. That’s a conveyor belt.

# Who REALLY Benefits

Follow the money:

# 1. The Judges

Judges PAY to judge others.

Think about that.

They invest in judging because the ROI is massive:

""World Championship Certified Judge"" on their business card.

""International Coffee Sensory Expert"" in their bio.

Unlike competitors, judges return YEAR AFTER YEAR.

They build careers judging others without ever competing themselves.

Zero skin in the game. All prestige, no risk.

# 2. The Coffee Shops

Genius-level employee retention.

Hospitality turnover: 70-100% annually.

Tell a barista they can compete? They'll stay put for 1-2 YEARS.

Why? Competition cycles are annual. Switching jobs kills momentum.

The shop ""invests"": practice time, beans, equipment.

The barista feels obligated. Committed. Trapped.

They tolerate low wages longer.

Golden handcuffs that cost almost nothing.

# 3. The Equipment Brands

The perfect numbers game.

Give free gear to 10 competitors globally.

Only ONE needs to win.

Suddenly their $300 grinder is ""WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP EQUIPMENT.""

No one remembers what losers used.

Post-competition marketing writes itself.

The ROI? Astronomical.

One winner = years of premium positioning.

The other nine sponsorships? Complete write-offs.

It's not about finding great equipment.

It's about manufacturing marketing narratives.

# 4. The Associations

The Specialty Coffee Association NEEDS these competitions.

Without them? Just another boring trade group.

With them? They're the OLYMPIC COMMITTEE of coffee.

They make the rules.

They certify the judges.

They DEFINE what ""good coffee"" means.

The entire ecosystem funnels money back to the association:

* Membership fees
* Educational programs
* Judge certifications
* Ticket sales
* Sponsorships
* Media attention

Without competitions, what authority would they have?

NONE.

**What’s Actually Being Tested?**

Not skill. Not depth. Not knowledge. Just this:

* Can you brew three pour-overs at once?  
* Can you memorize a script about sustainability?  
* Can you come up with some new pseudo-science that hasn’t been used in recent memory? 

Everyone uses the same beans, same ratios, same storylines. 

Let's examine the champion's routine (sorry George):

He measures water temperature: 96°C in kettle, lower in spout, 80°C in steel cup.

Revolutionary science? NO.

Pre-rinse your paper filter with hot water (like EVERY home brewer does) and you've solved George's ""problem.""

Most people brew into lightweight plastic, not heavy metal.

Apply a tiny bit of scrutiny and logic? The entire routine CRUMBLES.

**Why It Keeps Going**

People crave hierarchy. We want someone to tell us what’s good. Competitions manufacture that illusion. They don’t reveal mastery. They package it.

**The Status Game**

Baristas enter because it feels like the only way up. They don’t have money to open cafés. No leverage to start brands. Competitions are their shortcut to visibility. It’s a lottery where one wins—and dozens lose.

Notice who *doesn’t* compete? People with power. People with options. They already have what the competitors are chasing.

**The Truth**

Competitions exist to preserve power. They don’t elevate talent—they extract it. They don’t spread knowledge—they recycle it. They don’t reward skill—they reward compliance.

So the next time you hear “World Barista Champion,” remember: They’re just this year’s kid who got promoted to Santa.

I'm trying to find an old browser game I used to play with my sister on our old laptop—it's been driving me crazy that I can't remember the name. Here's everything I remember about it:

* **Platform**: It was a browser game (likely Flash or Unity-based) that we played directly on a website—no download needed.
* **Gameplay**: It was a 2D platformer fighting game, very similar in feel to *Brawlhalla*, but much simpler. It was strictly a **local 1v1 game**, where both players played on the same keyboard—one used WASD, the other used the arrow keys.
* **Characters**: The characters were all **food-themed**. I remember vividly one that shot **coffee beans** or some sort of coffee-based attack (my sister always played that one). I think there was also a **ketchup** character. Each character had their own combat combos or unique moves.
* **Art Style**: The graphics were **2D and colorful**, with a kind of quirky cartoonish vibe—maybe a bit like *Castle Crashers* in tone but more minimal. The arenas were platform-based, and you'd jump around trying to knock each other out.
* **Timeframe**: I played it somewhere between the **late 2000s and early 2010s**, possibly on a site like Kongregate, ArmorGames, or a similar Flash game hub.
* **Other Details**:
   * No story or campaign—just quick versus matches.
   * Might have had upbeat music or funny sound effects.
   * No online multiplayer, just couch co-op style on the same device.

I've looked through Flashpoint and even tried searching [Itch.io](http://Itch.io) and GameJolt, but haven’t had any luck. If anyone remembers a game like this or has any leads, I would be so grateful. It’s a big nostalgia hit for me and my sister!

I’m on the hunt for coffee roasters in Switzerland that offer South Italian-style espresso beans — the classic kind that’s dark, rich, low in acidity, and perfect for a strong, creamy espresso. Not a fan of the more modern, fruity or acidic profiles.

Until now, I’ve liked Stoll Coffee in terms of quality, but I’m wondering if there are other roasters out there (maybe more specialized or under-the-radar?) that really nail that deep, traditional southern Italian taste.

Any recommendations? Bonus points if they have locations near Zürich, Luzern, Basel Bern, !

Thanks a lot in advance!

- Clear out your kitchen 🧹
Toss sugary snacks, sodas, and processed foods.

Skip sweetened coffee, tea, and juice.


What Can You Eat? 🥑🥕

- Fresh or cooked veggies 🥦
- Whole fruits (in moderation) 🍏
- Eggs, chicken, fish, tofu 🍳🐟
- Nuts and seeds 🌰
- Beans and lentils 🫘
- Whole grains (like oats, quinoa) 🌾


Dealing with Cravings 😅

- Drink a glass of water 💧 (thirst often feels like hunger)

- Eat a healthy snack (nuts or apple slices) 🍎
- Distract yourself—call a friend or do a hobby 🎨


The First Week: What to Expect ⏳

- Headaches 🤕

In Summary

A sugar detox isn’t about punishing yourself—it’s about giving your body a chance to reset and thrive. Even a short break from sugar can help you feel lighter, brighter, and more in control. Why not give it a try? Your future self will thank you! 🙌🍀",1,1747588335.0,Healthylivingideas,0,1.0,False
1kpozwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/1kpozwc/is_this_a_good_story/,Is this a good story?,"Most people die by the age of 25, though their bodies aren’t buried until they turn 80. Somewhere along the way, we stopped living and started existing. The great trap — that relentless cycle of expectations and obligations — has made us brittle. It splinters us, bit by bit. Work. Work. And more work. We chase weekends like mirages in a desert, praying for the next public holiday, clinging to the hope of a promotion that might never come. Some call it corporate labour; I call it the death trap. “Get out now!” my mom’s voice rang out, cutting through the fog of my thoughts. “Are you going to stay in there all day?” she added, her tone edged with impatience. Startled, I snapped back to reality. Right — I was still in the bathroom. And I still hadn’t taken a shower.

It was the peak of summer, and my friends and I had just finished our exams, the weight of textbooks finally lifted from our shoulders. Bursting with excitement on the first day of our holidays, we rushed out of our homes like elephants and rhinos charging toward a watering hole, eager to reclaim our freedom. We gathered in the building lobby, buzzing with energy and looking for something exciting to do. That’s when a mischievous idea struck me — “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles,” I suggested, thinking it would be harmless fun. Little did I know, that one spontaneous decision would end up changing my life in ways I never saw coming.

Everyone was instantly on board, and just like that, we had a new conquest to embark upon. 	Energised by the shared mischief, we pulled out our phones and began crafting our fake Instagram profile. For the perfect display picture, we turned to the ever-reliable treasure trove — Pinterest. As I scrolled through the endless feed, my eyes locked onto an image that stopped me in my tracks: a face so enchanting, so impossibly flawless, it seemed to exist in that rare 0.01% realm where fantasy flirts with reality. I was momentarily spellbound by the image of that girl. But remembering our mission — not to stalk, just to choose — I snapped out of it, downloaded the image, and uploaded it as the face of our newly born \*fakesta\* profile.

I met my friends—Kabir, Neel, and Rishi—in the building lobby, the unofficial gathering spot for every aimless conversation we ever had. There was a manic kind of energy in the air, the sort that only comes when the rules have temporarily been suspended. Ideas flew between us—bike rides to the beach, LAN gaming marathons, movie binges that lasted days. We were high on the idea of doing anything that didn’t involve responsibility.

Then, without thinking, I said it: “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles.”

The group paused, then broke into laughter—not mocking, but intrigued. That was the magic of our friendship—bad ideas didn’t get shot down. They got tested. We grabbed our phones, already hyped, scrolling through Pinterest to find the perfect face for our made-up online persona. We weren’t planning anything sinister. Just harmless fun. We wanted to catfish our classmates a little, maybe send bizarre DMs, pretend to be influencers. Stupid entertainment.

As we scrolled, something stopped me. A single image. A girl, mid-laugh, her eyes closed, a few strands of hair swept across her cheek by the wind. She wasn’t exaggerated like those heavily filtered influencers—she was natural, effortlessly magnetic. There was a kind of rawness in her that made my chest tighten. I couldn’t look away.

“This one,” I said, holding up the image.

Kabir whistled. “Dude. If she was real, I’d marry her.”

Neel smirked. “Probably AI. Or some Russian model.”

But I didn’t laugh with them. I felt… odd. A strange pulse beneath my skin. The kind of ache you feel when you glimpse something you didn’t know you were missing. But I forced the feeling down. We named her Anaisha Dsouza, gave her a soft, artsy bio: “dreamer ✨ | painter 🎨 | coffee addict ☕ | 19 | Goa 💛.” Just enough fiction to make her believable. I uploaded the photo and watched our creation come to life.

Within hours, she had followers. Boys from our college started liking her photos, replying to her stories. She was beautiful, mysterious, and apparently, irresistible. The DMs began trickling in—compliments, emojis, a few flirty attempts. At first, it was hilarious. We took turns replying, saying the dumbest things, making bets on who would fall hardest. It was all a game.

But slowly, something shifted. The others lost interest after a few days. Rishi got caught sneaking out and was grounded. Neel moved on to simping over a new crush. Kabir was busy on a family road trip. But me? I stayed. I logged into the account more frequently than I checked my own. I started posting curated stories, writing captions that sounded poetic and deep. People responded. They listened. They cared. Nobody ever cared about me that way. Not the real me. I was just another forgettable face in a sea of average. But Anaisha? She was admired. She was wanted. And slowly, I started to feel more myself when I was her. It was intoxicating. Every like, every message, every digital interaction—it filled the silence in my life.

One night, curiosity got the better of me. I reverse image searched the original photo. I told myself it was just for fun. Just to see where it came from. But when the results loaded, my breath caught in my throat.

She was real.

Her name was Anaisha Verma. An art student from Pune. She had a blog called “Brushstrokes & Breaths.” Her real Instagram was linked. Private, but her profile picture matched. Her name. Her face. Her life—it all existed. And I had been parading around inside it like a thief in someone else’s home. I should have deleted everything right then. Logged out. Disappeared. But I didn’t. I followed her real account from a dummy profile. No messages. No likes. Just silent observation. I told myself it wasn’t stalking. I was only watching. Admiring, even. There’s no harm in admiring someone, right? Except admiration has a way of mutating into obsession when left unchecked.

I began studying her. Her art, her captions, her friends. She always wrote in lowercase, like her words were too delicate to shout. Her paintings were abstract and filled with emotion—colorful grief in motion. She posted pictures of her journal, her coffee cups, her favorite corner in her room where she painted late at night. It felt… personal. And I started to know things about her that I had no right to know.

One evening, a guy left a weird comment on one of her paintings. It was suggestive, uncomfortable. She didn’t reply. But I noticed. I used the fake Anaisha account to message him from another direction, anonymously, hinting that someone was watching. He blocked her the next day. She never knew why. But I did. I told myself I was doing something good. I was protecting her. That was the beginning of the lie I would eventually start believing. That I wasn’t a predator. That I wasn’t doing harm. That I was some kind of invisible guardian—keeping the wolves at bay while she painted in peace.

I began justifying more and more of it. I tracked the places she visited through geotags. I guessed her university schedule based on what days she posted stories from campus. I wrote fake poetry and posted it on “her” account—poems I had written late at night, too scared to share under my own name. People messaged her saying she was brave. That she had touched them. That she made them feel seen.

But nobody saw me.

And that’s how it all started. With a prank. A pretty picture. A moment of boredom that spiraled into something darker. I didn’t know then how deep I would go, how much I would lose, or what it would cost me to come back.

Looking back now, I don’t even know what scared me more—the fact that I was pretending to be someone else, or the fact that I felt more real while doing it.

And admittedly, I skipped most of the dialogue because the new one just doesn't appeal to me. So I'll be discussing other parts of the version such as the Sea of Stars map, events, and other features. I'm no game designer, but I'm just stating my opinions as a regular player on what I think would be fun.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**SEA OF STARS MAP:**

The SoS map is... Very dull and empty. There's barely anything that you can do in there, save for dailies. The dailies feel like an absolute chore, which I guess is in nature for dailies in almost every game. However, comparing the SoS dailies to the regular dailies that we already do on top of that, it doesn't really seem that beneficial to do?

  
For regular dailies we have... Fight esselings (gives us materials), collect flowers (gives us materials), collect insects (gives us materials), spend vital energy (something you're bound to do anyways, which... Gives us materials), enhance eureka (color gambling, Ig sorta gives materials), do minigames (gives extra dias), collect ""dig, pear pal"" (gives materials, and you're bound to do it anyways). Only exception here is ""take a picture"".

For the SoS dailies? We have ring the bell (something you're bound to do), go to the furry circle of sadness and try to turn into a rare animal, slave labor, slave labor, whatever that star daily is (I still can't figure it out for the life of me), this depressing seesaw, hop on giant bubble, make glowing flowers glow, pick up trash from the sea, take a picture, take a picture, take a picture... All feels very worthless and dull activities to me.



Now onto the map itself. As I've said, it feels very dull and empty. For a small map, you'd expect a lot of exciting things to be crammed in there, but no! We barely get anything! Some changes I propose:

\- **The Gazebo**

There's this gazebo(?) near the lookbook that I personally think is really pretty! Whoever designed it did a great job! However, the sight around it is very depressing. Dull flowers and some desolate areas. I think that they should add a large garden around it, then add maybe a few more gazebos within said garden. But don't make it a garden of regular flowers, no no no. You see those large, glowing flowers near the lookbook area? I think they should make a large garden of those, while mixing in some cute little flower bushes to prevent too much clipping. Similar to what they've already done to the flowers around the lookbook.

It'll be make a good photo spot for players, and the devs can also throw in some collectables in there. The lookbook can be in the middle of this garden, keeping the current platform and flower arrangements it has to keep it highlighted as an important location.

The flowers would also still glow during the night, so the garden could be like a garden of stars within the sea of stars.

  
\- **The Furry Circle of Sadness (Animal Playtime)**

For an area named ""animal playtime"", there's definitely not much play going on in there. Given the already childish route that they're going with, I want them to lean heavily into that childishness. Turn it into a full on animal daycare with an animal obstacle course (saw the obstacle course idea from AethenRai here on reddit, and I absolutely love it. And I came up with some ideas for it... Sorta)

  
To encourage players to actually use the transformation feature, some obstacles would require you to change into certain animal types. Small animals to fit into small spaces, heavy animals to push buttons and objects, birds to let players reach higher places.

  
\- **Teetering Depression (The Infamous Seesaw)**

Since there's already a seesaw, why not add a whole playground? Add a slide, a climbing wall, a monkey bar, a swing, a tire obstacle course! They could add different rides too, which encourages coop photo mode like what they did in the firework isles. A ferris wheel to ""touch the stars"", a rollercoaster that travels around the map to showcase its beauty and allow players to appreciate it while they sit back and watch their Nikkis sit there, maybe taking pictures with their friends.

  
\- **Bubble Dreamland**

I'm gonna be honest, I don't even know why it's here. Maybe to just fit in with the whole ""bubble season"" thing? If so, then it should've been in Serenity Island. But if they insist on keeping the whole hopping buttons thingy in the map, it could be something still star/space related. Like it summons a bunch of shooting stars, a meteor shower, a comet, or just adds more stars to the sky in general

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**SERENITY ISLAND**

As a map, it's already much better than the SoS. But I'm gonna be honest, after the events, I've not touched this map at all. I'm just not that motivated to come here. Only thing I can say is that they need to add this to the interactive map already. Why add a new map but not add it to the interactive map?

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**THE EVENTS**

The events really just feel so... Boring. We have a jumping event that we've gotten several times already, and then a domain that we've also gotten several times already. The sticker one was alright, I honestly like it. The Soiree... Could be better. And so, I managed to rack my brain up for a couple of event ideas:



\- **A Bubble Making Event**

Similar to the bullquet event where we used materials to dye the bullquet random colors, here we can use materials to make different kinds of bubbles. From differently colored regular bubbles, to uniquely shaped bubbles. Such as a floof shaped bubble, a bowtie cat shaped bubble, a cushion squirrel shaped bubble, etc etc. This would encourage players to explore the map more, just to collect materials. This can be a permanent event, reason stated below.

This would then connect to another issue I have

\- **The Bubblet**

Turn this stupid thing into a handheld, I BEG of you, InFold. I'm talking of both the paid and free bubblets, just turn them into free bubblets. Now, the items that we get from the bubble making event would be consumables, sorta like the fireworks from firework isles. These bubbles would then be connected to the bubblet handhelds, which would allow the bubblets to make bubbles for a certain period of time once consumed.

There's still bubbles, players can look pretty with their little magical girl bubble wands, exploration is encouraged, players may spend for materials, more players would buy the limited bubblet if it's an actual handheld.

\- **Animal Grooming Event**

Serenity Island has a really cute looking bath area that I like. It's a shame that it serves no purpose other than aesthetic appeal. And so I think it could be use for an animal grooming event, where we choose different animals, clean them up, groom them, and maybe even dress them up! Hell! Maybe just make it a Momo grooming event! This cat is so afraid of water, he needs a bath!

After all that, the animals would walk their own little runway to showcase your work. You can also take a photo with the animals you styled. This event can be either solo or coop.

\- **Bubble Shooting Event**

Self explanatory. Literally just shooting bubbles. The more you pop, the more points you get.

\- **Hide and Seek**

Hide and seek in random maps throughout Miraland, similar to Windtrace, if you've ever played genshin. However, this event could be either coop or solo (making coop optional for my fellow introverts out there). The coop mode would be standard hide and seek. Find all the hiding Nikkis before the time runs out, and the it wins. A single hiding Nikki manages to escape the its clutches, the hiding Nikkis win.

As for the solo mode, we would be playing against NPCs depending on where we are on the map. The NPCs would be running around the map, trying to find Nikki. If they find Nikki, Nikki loses. If Nikki isn't found until the time is up, or if Nikki reaches a certain checkpoint before the time is up, then Nikki wins. Nikki being it is just Nikki looking for the NPCs.

\- **Bed Building Event**

Since both of the four stars in the five star banner are sleepwear, I thought, why not? We can build and design different beds for various NPCs, and InFold can just say it's a ""preview"" of the housing system.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**SWISH & STICHT SOIREE**

I don't have much to say about this other than PLEASE REMOVE THE TIME GATE! NOT JUST MOVE OR ADJUST IT! NAY! REMOVE IT! That is all.

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**THE DYEING SYSTEM**

Oh boy, where do I even begin... I have way too many problems with this god forsaken system. From dyes not working, to dyes not even dyeing colors properly. Like I once tried to dye a red belt black, and what color did it turn to? CYAN! How does that even make sense?!

Some dyes act as actual dyes, some dyes act as overlays, some dyes don't work, some dyes just don't even dye it into the right color. Not an overlay, just outright the wrong color. InFold needs to pick one and go with it.

Unlocking dyes is too expensive, and the current dyeing currency are way too scarce. As each palette is **literally named after materials,** we could've used those to unlock the currency instead. But ALAS! The poor billion dollar company still needs their money! So okay, let's keep the current dyeing currencies. However, these are some changes/additions that I propose:

\- Add more ways to earn these materials. One way I could think of is adding a new stage in the Realm of the Dark. We would fight that new boss for the dyeing currency. Now it'll not only be accessible to all players, it could also encourage people to spend more diamonds or money in exchange for vital energy to do this realm. InFold gets more money, and we get more dyeing currency

\- THE GRADIENTS- OH THE GRADIENTS! LET US CHOOSE WHAT COLORS WE WANT TO BE IN OUR GRADIENTS. THANK YOU.

\- **Make the color wheel free with the final evolution.** As many of you may have noticed, we have a color wheel! But not only is it for five stars only, it's also locked behind two expensive requirements: Obtaining the final evolution, as well as unlocking **every single palette.** There are 18 palettes, and each one would cost at most 12 radiant prisms (for a dress). So ***just for the dress alone,*** you would need ***216 Radiant Prisms***. And that's not even the full outfit! It's ridiculous! However, if this is far too generous for InFold's standards, they could just have the palettes be unlocked per outfit instead of per piece.

1kporj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1kporj0/dont_read_this_story_the_good_stalker/,Don't read this story: The Good Stalker,"Most people die by the age of 25, though their bodies aren’t buried until they turn 80. Somewhere along the way, we stopped living and started existing. The great trap — that relentless cycle of expectations and obligations — has made us brittle. It splinters us, bit by bit. Work. Work. And more work. We chase weekends like mirages in a desert, praying for the next public holiday, clinging to the hope of a promotion that might never come. Some call it corporate labour; I call it the death trap. “Get out now!” my mom’s voice rang out, cutting through the fog of my thoughts. “Are you going to stay in there all day?” she added, her tone edged with impatience. Startled, I snapped back to reality. Right — I was still in the bathroom. And I still hadn’t taken a shower.

It was the peak of summer, and my friends and I had just finished our exams, the weight of textbooks finally lifted from our shoulders. Bursting with excitement on the first day of our holidays, we rushed out of our homes like elephants and rhinos charging toward a watering hole, eager to reclaim our freedom. We gathered in the building lobby, buzzing with energy and looking for something exciting to do. That’s when a mischievous idea struck me — “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles,” I suggested, thinking it would be harmless fun. Little did I know, that one spontaneous decision would end up changing my life in ways I never saw coming.

Everyone was instantly on board, and just like that, we had a new conquest to embark upon. 	Energised by the shared mischief, we pulled out our phones and began crafting our fake Instagram profile. For the perfect display picture, we turned to the ever-reliable treasure trove — Pinterest. As I scrolled through the endless feed, my eyes locked onto an image that stopped me in my tracks: a face so enchanting, so impossibly flawless, it seemed to exist in that rare 0.01% realm where fantasy flirts with reality. I was momentarily spellbound by the image of that girl. But remembering our mission — not to stalk, just to choose — I snapped out of it, downloaded the image, and uploaded it as the face of our newly born \*fakesta\* profile.

I met my friends—Kabir, Neel, and Rishi—in the building lobby, the unofficial gathering spot for every aimless conversation we ever had. There was a manic kind of energy in the air, the sort that only comes when the rules have temporarily been suspended. Ideas flew between us—bike rides to the beach, LAN gaming marathons, movie binges that lasted days. We were high on the idea of doing anything that didn’t involve responsibility.

Then, without thinking, I said it: “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles.”

The group paused, then broke into laughter—not mocking, but intrigued. That was the magic of our friendship—bad ideas didn’t get shot down. They got tested. We grabbed our phones, already hyped, scrolling through Pinterest to find the perfect face for our made-up online persona. We weren’t planning anything sinister. Just harmless fun. We wanted to catfish our classmates a little, maybe send bizarre DMs, pretend to be influencers. Stupid entertainment.

As we scrolled, something stopped me. A single image. A girl, mid-laugh, her eyes closed, a few strands of hair swept across her cheek by the wind. She wasn’t exaggerated like those heavily filtered influencers—she was natural, effortlessly magnetic. There was a kind of rawness in her that made my chest tighten. I couldn’t look away.

“This one,” I said, holding up the image.

Kabir whistled. “Dude. If she was real, I’d marry her.”

Neel smirked. “Probably AI. Or some Russian model.”

But I didn’t laugh with them. I felt… odd. A strange pulse beneath my skin. The kind of ache you feel when you glimpse something you didn’t know you were missing. But I forced the feeling down. We named her Anaisha Dsouza, gave her a soft, artsy bio: “dreamer ✨ | painter 🎨 | coffee addict ☕ | 19 | Goa 💛.” Just enough fiction to make her believable. I uploaded the photo and watched our creation come to life.

Within hours, she had followers. Boys from our college started liking her photos, replying to her stories. She was beautiful, mysterious, and apparently, irresistible. The DMs began trickling in—compliments, emojis, a few flirty attempts. At first, it was hilarious. We took turns replying, saying the dumbest things, making bets on who would fall hardest. It was all a game.

But slowly, something shifted. The others lost interest after a few days. Rishi got caught sneaking out and was grounded. Neel moved on to simping over a new crush. Kabir was busy on a family road trip. But me? I stayed. I logged into the account more frequently than I checked my own. I started posting curated stories, writing captions that sounded poetic and deep. People responded. They listened. They cared. Nobody ever cared about me that way. Not the real me. I was just another forgettable face in a sea of average. But Anaisha? She was admired. She was wanted. And slowly, I started to feel more myself when I was her. It was intoxicating. Every like, every message, every digital interaction—it filled the silence in my life.

One night, curiosity got the better of me. I reverse image searched the original photo. I told myself it was just for fun. Just to see where it came from. But when the results loaded, my breath caught in my throat.

She was real.

Her name was Anaisha Verma. An art student from Pune. She had a blog called “Brushstrokes & Breaths.” Her real Instagram was linked. Private, but her profile picture matched. Her name. Her face. Her life—it all existed. And I had been parading around inside it like a thief in someone else’s home. I should have deleted everything right then. Logged out. Disappeared. But I didn’t. I followed her real account from a dummy profile. No messages. No likes. Just silent observation. I told myself it wasn’t stalking. I was only watching. Admiring, even. There’s no harm in admiring someone, right? Except admiration has a way of mutating into obsession when left unchecked.

I began studying her. Her art, her captions, her friends. She always wrote in lowercase, like her words were too delicate to shout. Her paintings were abstract and filled with emotion—colorful grief in motion. She posted pictures of her journal, her coffee cups, her favorite corner in her room where she painted late at night. It felt… personal. And I started to know things about her that I had no right to know.

One evening, a guy left a weird comment on one of her paintings. It was suggestive, uncomfortable. She didn’t reply. But I noticed. I used the fake Anaisha account to message him from another direction, anonymously, hinting that someone was watching. He blocked her the next day. She never knew why. But I did. I told myself I was doing something good. I was protecting her. That was the beginning of the lie I would eventually start believing. That I wasn’t a predator. That I wasn’t doing harm. That I was some kind of invisible guardian—keeping the wolves at bay while she painted in peace.

I began justifying more and more of it. I tracked the places she visited through geotags. I guessed her university schedule based on what days she posted stories from campus. I wrote fake poetry and posted it on “her” account—poems I had written late at night, too scared to share under my own name. People messaged her saying she was brave. That she had touched them. That she made them feel seen.

But nobody saw me.

And that’s how it all started. With a prank. A pretty picture. A moment of boredom that spiraled into something darker. I didn’t know then how deep I would go, how much I would lose, or what it would cost me to come back.

Looking back now, I don’t even know what scared me more—the fact that I was pretending to be someone else, or the fact that I felt more real while doing it.

I'm the creator of [e7rtastats.com](https://www.epic7rtastats.com/) - a site that collects and aggregates RTA data and presents in-depth stats for heroes, artifacts, sets, and builds used by high level players across the world. It's been more than a year since I first released the site and I've received a lot of great responses and feedback. I've recently picked this back up again and I've made a couple new changes as well as improved the site's performance since the initial release.


&#x200B;


I'd like to show a new page I added - the [Meta](https://www.epic7rtastats.com/meta) page. If you are new to this site, please read my [first](https://reddit.com/r/EpicSeven/comments/16ui165/introducing_epic7rtastatscom_a_website_that/?ref=share&ref_source=link) post where I talked through each of the pages or you can look at the [About](https://www.epic7rtastats.com/about) page.

&#x200B;

The Meta page is an attempt to provide users with a quick snapshot/summary of the current meta. While the other pages take data from the entire season, the Meta page aggregates matches from the last 7 days and shows changes compared to the week before that. For example, today's meta snapshot would account for games played from **May 10 - 17**, and shows the increase or decrease compared to games played from **May 3 - 10**. 

&#x200B;

[Meta Stats](https://imgur.com/a/J2PVdet)

There are 3 filter options - By Games, Trending Up, and Trending Down. ""By Games"" will show the top heroes sorted by the number of games, ""Trending Up"" will show the top heroes sorted by the largest increase compared to the previous week, and ""Trending Down"" will show the top heroes sorted by the largest decrease compared to the previous week.

&#x200B;

[Pick Order and Pre-Banned Pairs](https://imgur.com/a/qktfBX6)

The ""Pick Order"" section shows the top heroes picked in every draft position for both first pick and second pick. The ""Pre-Banned Pairs"" section shows the top pre-ban pairs.

&#x200B;

More changes and new features will be coming soon. I plan to extend the Meta page with more RTA trends like changes to hero builds and artifact usage, and more information to help everyone with their Summer season climb.

If you can have questions or feedback, feel free to send me a message on Reddit or you can contact me on Discord (@zhaux). If you enjoy my site and would like to support me, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/zhaux). Thanks!",36,1747587554.0,EpicSeven,4,1.0,False

I followed her real account from a dummy profile. No messages. No likes. Just silent observation. I told myself it wasn’t stalking. I was only watching. Admiring, even. There’s no harm in admiring someone, right? Except admiration has a way of mutating into obsession when left unchecked.

I began studying her. Her art, her captions, her friends. She always wrote in lowercase, like her words were too delicate to shout. Her paintings were abstract and filled with emotion—colorful grief in motion. She posted pictures of her journal, her coffee cups, her favorite corner in her room where she painted late at night. It felt… personal. And I started to know things about her that I had no right to know.

One evening, a guy left a weird comment on one of her paintings. It was suggestive, uncomfortable. She didn’t reply. But I noticed. I used the fake Anaisha account to message him from another direction, anonymously, hinting that someone was watching. He blocked her the next day. She never knew why. But I did. I told myself I was doing something good. I was protecting her. That was the beginning of the lie I would eventually start believing. That I wasn’t a predator. That I wasn’t doing harm. That I was some kind of invisible guardian—keeping the wolves at bay while she painted in peace.

I began justifying more and more of it. I tracked the places she visited through geotags. I guessed her university schedule based on what days she posted stories from campus. I wrote fake poetry and posted it on “her” account—poems I had written late at night, too scared to share under my own name. People messaged her saying she was brave. That she had touched them. That she made them feel seen.

But nobody saw me.

And that’s how it all started. With a prank. A pretty picture. A moment of boredom that spiraled into something darker. I didn’t know then how deep I would go, how much I would lose, or what it would cost me to come back.

Looking back now, I don’t even know what scared me more—the fact that I was pretending to be someone else, or the fact that I felt more real while doing it.

I'm looking to give my system a little performance boost, and I suspect my current RAM is the main bottleneck right now. I'm still running 1600MHz DDR3, which feels pretty outdated by today's standards.

My rig holds up decently for most tasks and some gaming, but I’m starting to feel the limits, especially with multitasking or more memory-hungry games/apps. I’ve attached a screenshot of my full system specs for reference (CPU, motherboard, current RAM setup, GPU, etc.).

Considering the motherboard I’m using and the limitations of my platform, what’s the best RAM upgrade I can realistically go for? Is it worth upgrading the RAM alone, or would that money be better saved toward a more substantial platform upgrade down the line (like DDR4/DDR5 and a new CPU)?

Would appreciate any suggestions, especially from those who’ve dealt with similar setups!

Somewhere along the way, we stopped living and started existing. The great trap — that relentless cycle of expectations and obligations — has made us brittle. It splinters us, bit by bit. Work. Work. And more work. We chase weekends like mirages in a desert, praying for the next public holiday, clinging to the hope of a promotion that might never come. Some call it corporate labour; I call it the death trap. “Get out now!” my mom’s voice rang out, cutting through the fog of my thoughts. “Are you going to stay in there all day?” she added, her tone edged with impatience. Startled, I snapped back to reality. Right — I was still in the bathroom. And I still hadn’t taken a shower.

It was the peak of summer, and my friends and I had just finished our exams, the weight of textbooks finally lifted from our shoulders. Bursting with excitement on the first day of our holidays, we rushed out of our homes like elephants and rhinos charging toward a watering hole, eager to reclaim our freedom. We gathered in the building lobby, buzzing with energy and looking for something exciting to do. That’s when a mischievous idea struck me — “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles,” I suggested, thinking it would be harmless fun. Little did I know, that one spontaneous decision would end up changing my life in ways I never saw coming.

Everyone was instantly on board, and just like that, we had a new conquest to embark upon. 	Energised by the shared mischief, we pulled out our phones and began crafting our fake Instagram profile. For the perfect display picture, we turned to the ever-reliable treasure trove — Pinterest. As I scrolled through the endless feed, my eyes locked onto an image that stopped me in my tracks: a face so enchanting, so impossibly flawless, it seemed to exist in that rare 0.01% realm where fantasy flirts with reality. I was momentarily spellbound by the image of that girl. But remembering our mission — not to stalk, just to choose — I snapped out of it, downloaded the image, and uploaded it as the face of our newly born \*fakesta\* profile.

I met my friends—Kabir, Neel, and Rishi—in the building lobby, the unofficial gathering spot for every aimless conversation we ever had. There was a manic kind of energy in the air, the sort that only comes when the rules have temporarily been suspended. Ideas flew between us—bike rides to the beach, LAN gaming marathons, movie binges that lasted days. We were high on the idea of doing anything that didn’t involve responsibility.

Then, without thinking, I said it: “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles.”

The group paused, then broke into laughter—not mocking, but intrigued. That was the magic of our friendship—bad ideas didn’t get shot down. They got tested. We grabbed our phones, already hyped, scrolling through Pinterest to find the perfect face for our made-up online persona. We weren’t planning anything sinister. Just harmless fun. We wanted to catfish our classmates a little, maybe send bizarre DMs, pretend to be influencers. Stupid entertainment.

As we scrolled, something stopped me. A single image. A girl, mid-laugh, her eyes closed, a few strands of hair swept across her cheek by the wind. She wasn’t exaggerated like those heavily filtered influencers—she was natural, effortlessly magnetic. There was a kind of rawness in her that made my chest tighten. I couldn’t look away.

“This one,” I said, holding up the image.

Kabir whistled. “Dude. If she was real, I’d marry her.”

Neel smirked. “Probably AI. Or some Russian model.”

But I didn’t laugh with them. I felt… odd. A strange pulse beneath my skin. The kind of ache you feel when you glimpse something you didn’t know you were missing. But I forced the feeling down. We named her Anaisha Dsouza, gave her a soft, artsy bio: “dreamer ✨ | painter 🎨 | coffee addict ☕ | 19 | Goa 💛.” Just enough fiction to make her believable. I uploaded the photo and watched our creation come to life.

Within hours, she had followers. Boys from our college started liking her photos, replying to her stories. She was beautiful, mysterious, and apparently, irresistible. The DMs began trickling in—compliments, emojis, a few flirty attempts. At first, it was hilarious. We took turns replying, saying the dumbest things, making bets on who would fall hardest. It was all a game.

But slowly, something shifted. The others lost interest after a few days. Rishi got caught sneaking out and was grounded. Neel moved on to simping over a new crush. Kabir was busy on a family road trip. But me? I stayed. I logged into the account more frequently than I checked my own. I started posting curated stories, writing captions that sounded poetic and deep. People responded. They listened. They cared. Nobody ever cared about me that way. Not the real me. I was just another forgettable face in a sea of average. But Anaisha? She was admired. She was wanted. And slowly, I started to feel more myself when I was her. It was intoxicating. Every like, every message, every digital interaction—it filled the silence in my life.

One night, curiosity got the better of me. I reverse image searched the original photo. I told myself it was just for fun. Just to see where it came from. But when the results loaded, my breath caught in my throat.

She was real.

As I stood outside the house, I wondered to myself again whether this was a good idea. I concluded that it wasn’t, but proceeded anyway. The house was a semi-terraced on the end of a run of houses, not too different from my own at the time. I pushed the gate open and made my way up the path. I raised my hand and knocked three times. As I stood waiting, I looked at the bay window and noticed that the curtains were all drawn. I then looked upwards and saw that both the front bedrooms also had all the curtains drawn.

The door suddenly shot open, making me jump. I turned and saw a woman standing in the doorway. Boy, was she a mess. Her hair was unkempt and sticking out at odd angles, accompanied by dark, heavy bags under her eyes. Her eyes were dull and lifeless, the whites tinted red. Shocked at the state of the woman in front of me, I found myself unable to say anything. I found myself in a staring contest of sorts, with both contestants wondering who would be the first to blink. After a few moments, I simply managed “Hello.” She still said nothing, her eyes narrowing slightly. I continued, “I received your letter? Asking me to come to see your son?”

She lunged out of the doorway, grabbing me roughly by the shoulder and dragging me inside. “Hey, hang on a minute.” She shut the door and turned to face me. Her expression stopped me short of finishing my protest. Gone was the look of disinterest, and now in its place was one of emotion. Tears welling in her eyes and her lips wobbling, she stepped forward, wrapping her arms around me. For the second time in the past ten minutes, she had shocked me into speechlessness. Not knowing what else to do, I simply stood as she shuddered with each silent sob, waiting for her to release me.

I raised my hand and patted her back. “Hey, hey now, it’s alright.” She slowly unfurled away from me and stood, her shoulders slumped, clearly a defeated woman. “He’s upstairs at the moment”, she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Why don’t we sit down and we can talk about what’s going on, ok?” She simply nodded, turning and walking down the hallway, turning into the room on the right, which I assumed was the living room. I didn’t immediately follow, and she didn’t check to see if I was. I turned to look at the front door, wondering whether I should open it and make a break for it. Whatever was happening here was intense. I knew this even though the only evidence was the woman whom I had deduced must be Sylvie.

After staring for a moment longer, I turned and followed her down the hallway and into the living room. What met me was a mess, the floor, furniture and every other available surface were covered in food wrappings and bottles, each with contents in varying states of consumption. She had turned to face me as I stood in the doorway. Swinging her hand around the room, she said, “Sit down.” Finding the seat with the least amount of rubbish, I sat gingerly, cringing internally and resolving to have the most thorough wash in the history of mankind once I got back home.

Sitting in a chair in front of me and off to the left, she picked a bottle up off the floor and swigged the remaining contents. She then burped and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand before looking at me. “Do you want something to drink? I can get you a tea or coffee?” A little too quickly, “No”, I responded. As quickly as it appeared, it was gone, a look. One of shame. Seeking to remedy my action, I continued, “No, thank you, I grabbed a coffee on the way here, thank you though.” This seemed to provide some comfort as a small smile found her lips.

“So”, I said. “Why don’t you tell me about what has been going on, and we’ll see what I can do to help.” She nodded before speaking. “Ok.” The tale she then told me was one I would never have believed if I did not possess the gift I did. But I do, which is why by the time she had finished, I was certain I had made a grave mistake in my misguided efforts to come and help.

*“My son Oscar has always been a sweet and kind boy. I need you to know that before I tell you everything else that has happened. Please know that.”*

I nodded my head “I do, please continue.” She smiled and then resumed.

*“He’s eleven years old. We always knew there was something special about him. He always seemed to be able to say the right thing at the right time. He never had any trouble making friends, he had so many, always smiling and clamouring around him at school. But something’s changed; he’s not the same boy that he was; he’s become distant. Worse than that, though, he has become someone entirely different. Every time I try to talk to him, he looks so offended and the way he speaks to me sometimes.”*

She choked back a sob. “I’m sorry she said. It’s been hard lately.” I nodded and waited. After a couple of moments, she seemed to regain some composure and continued.

*“It started a couple of months ago. I awoke to him screaming in the middle of the night. Now, nothing like this has ever happened. He’s had nightmares, sure, but when I heard him, I panicked. The fear I felt, I thought he was genuinely in danger. I rushed to his room, flicking the light on, to see him thrashing about in bed. I knelt beside him and gently tried to wake him. When he opened his eyes and looked at me, I could see for a minute that he wasn’t seeing me, but he was still seeing whatever had been in his dream.”*

“Did he tell you what the dream was about?” I asked. She looked at me for a moment before continuing.

*“He did. He said that he had dreamt that he had woken up in the middle of the night to find a man standing at the end of his bed. He couldn’t say what he looked like, only that he was made of shadows or like a silhouette. Oscar said the man had said something to him, but he couldn’t remember what. But that was only the beginning. I kept him off from school the next day as he said he wasn’t feeling well, and given what had happened the night before, I wasn’t going to argue.*

*I was downstairs tidying up when I thought I could hear someone talking. At first I thought it was the next door’s TV, but as I neared the stairs I realised that I was wrong. It was Oscar. I went upstairs to see who he was talking to when I saw him standing at the top of the stairs on the landing, talking to himself. I didn’t say anything for a moment and let him continue. It sounded like whoever he was talking to was asking him questions about himself as he said, “I live with my mum.” Then he went quiet as if he was listening, and then said, “No, I don’t have a dad anymore.” It was then that I asked him who he was talking to. “Oscar, honey? Who’re you talking to?”*

*He turned and looked at me and said. “The voices. Now I’m not religious or anything, but this did make me nervous. I didn’t want to show him I was afraid, so I smiled and said, “Whose voices, sweetie?” His answer didn’t help in the slightest. “I don’t know. They just ask me questions and talk to me.”*

She paused there and looked at me. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t feeling unnerved. “Ok”, I said. “Did he say how long he has been talking to these voices?” She stayed silent for a moment before opening her mouth. “Not exactly, but he said it has been a while.” Before she could speak, a voice could be heard from upstairs, “Mummy, can you bring me a drink?” Sylvie looked at the doorway, her eyes wide. “Yes, sweetie, one moment.” She stood up and made her way to the door. “I’ll be back in a minute.” With that, she left me alone to sit and think about what she had told me so far.

I pondered over what she had said about him hearing and talking to voices. It was weird for sure, but not too different from when I began to hear people’s thoughts. Although the question remained, who was asking him questions? When you hear other people’s thoughts, they tend not to talk back unless they know that you are there. Could it perhaps then be another telepath? If so, that was bad, but I knew I would have to wait for Sylvie to return before I could make a conclusive judgment.

A scream came from upstairs, accompanied by a thud. “That’s not the drink I wanted! Get out! Get out!” This was accompanied by thudding and the slamming of a door. Footsteps could be heard coming back down the stairs before Sylvie appeared in the doorway. Her skin glistened, and her hair was damp. I followed her with my gaze as she walked into the room and sat down once more. She looked down into her lap, not saying anything. I didn’t want to push her, so I remained quiet, letting her continue when she was ready. Suddenly and without looking up, she said, “That’s another thing, he has never called me mummy, always mum, or when he was still learning to talk, mumu or moo, but never mummy.” I sat waiting for her to continue, but she didn’t, so I spoke instead. “Has anything happened as of late that you can think of that would have?” She cut me off with a resounding “No, nothing.”

I looked down at my lap and let out a breath, struggling to take in what was happening and why I was here. I mean, sure, I could read his mind, delve deep, maybe I could find some source for the trauma, but there was not a lot I could do about it. The question also remained as to who had mentioned me; she said a friend of a friend, but never actually named them. No one knew what I could do, so that was puzzling me, however, there were more pressing matters at hand. Pushing the question away, I looked back up. “How about you finish your account before I ask any more questions, hmm?”

*“He said he had been talking with these voices for some time. I asked him what they talked about, and he said about everything. They had asked about himself, me, his dad, his friends and school. I at first thought it was some sort of imaginary friend, something like that, you know, but then he said, they told him things.”*

“Like what?”

*“Things he couldn’t possibly have known, things that I’ve never told him, even some things that happened while he was a baby or before he was born.”*

*“Did you ever get an answer as to who they were, or who he thought they were?” “No”, she said. I tapped my knee with my fingers as I thought. “Is there anything more to the story, or is that most of it?” The look she gave made me realise I already knew the answer. “There’s more.” Thinking to myself, “Of course, there is.”*

*“The voices continued, although now I would not let him be anywhere without me. The first thing I did was book an appointment with a child psychologist, Dr Leo. After a few sessions, I received a call saying he would be unable to continue the sessions with Oscar due to his continually busy schedule, but he could recommend several other really good psychologists. I knew this was a lie.”*

“How did you know?” “Let’s just call it instinct.”

*“One afternoon, I left Oscar with Mrs Peters, our next-door neighbour, while I went to meet with Dr Leo. It was there that I confirmed that my suspicions had been correct when he showed me some of Oscar’s drawings.” They were dark, really dark. I mean, he’s always been this happy-go-lucky kid, always had a secure home, great friends and family. Then with the voices and a bit after that the nightmares.”*

Cutting her off, I spoke up, “Nightmares? Like more than one?” She avoided my gaze, “Yes, they started few and far between, small ones, but they progressively got worse, the final one that he has mentioned being the one with the man. I looked at her for a moment before casting my eyes to the ceiling, where just above my head, Oscar could be heard trotting around, the soft creak of the floorboards giving away his movements. Dropping my eyes back to Sylvie, “What were these drawings like, what were they of?”

It was then that she rose and went into the next room. I could hear a drawer being opened, accompanied by the rustling of papers. Then the drawer was shut, and she made her way back into the room. As she passed, she handed me a small bundle of paper. As she sat back down, I began to look at the images, already realising this was beyond me and continually getting worse and worse.

The first was a picture of two figures, who were named Oscar and Mum, with another one in the background, but this one remained nameless. I flicked through a couple, settling on another one, of a boy, again Oscar, crouched down, surrounded by figures, all talking to him. The figure of Oscar, with his hands raised in what looked like him trying to cover his ears. The further I moved through the stack, the more intense they got, all of them following the theme of an unwelcome presence, starting with one and then a few and eventually becoming many.

Not raising my eyes, I asked, “Has he been tested for Schizophrenia? It sounds a lot worse than it is; it’s very manageable now, and there are plenty of treatment options.” I waited for a response while continuing to flick through the pictures. When long enough had passed without one, I raised my eyes back to Sylvie, who sat watching me, her expression solemn. “Look at the last one. That should answer your question.”

Wasting no time with the rest, I flicked through to the back, my eyes widening and my heart beginning a thunderous beat in my chest. The page was less drawing and more message. A small Oscar, with another person standing behind him, hand on his shoulder. All around them was written “Bring me John” and “My friend John.” After an intense struggle, I managed to wrestle my gaze from the page and looked at Sylvie, who simply looked back. “Does that answer your question?”

I was momentarily spellbound by the image of that girl. But remembering our mission — not to stalk, just to choose — I snapped out of it, downloaded the image, and uploaded it as the face of our newly born \*fakesta\* profile.

I met my friends—Kabir, Neel, and Rishi—in the building lobby, the unofficial gathering spot for every aimless conversation we ever had. There was a manic kind of energy in the air, the sort that only comes when the rules have temporarily been suspended. Ideas flew between us—bike rides to the beach, LAN gaming marathons, movie binges that lasted days. We were high on the idea of doing anything that didn’t involve responsibility.

Then, without thinking, I said it: “Let’s make fake Instagram profiles.”

The group paused, then broke into laughter—not mocking, but intrigued. That was the magic of our friendship—bad ideas didn’t get shot down. They got tested. We grabbed our phones, already hyped, scrolling through Pinterest to find the perfect face for our made-up online persona. We weren’t planning anything sinister. Just harmless fun. We wanted to catfish our classmates a little, maybe send bizarre DMs, pretend to be influencers. Stupid entertainment.

As we scrolled, something stopped me. A single image. A girl, mid-laugh, her eyes closed, a few strands of hair swept across her cheek by the wind. She wasn’t exaggerated like those heavily filtered influencers—she was natural, effortlessly magnetic. There was a kind of rawness in her that made my chest tighten. I couldn’t look away.

“This one,” I said, holding up the image.

Kabir whistled. “Dude. If she was real, I’d marry her.”

Neel smirked. “Probably AI. Or some Russian model.”

But I didn’t laugh with them. I felt… odd. A strange pulse beneath my skin. The kind of ache you feel when you glimpse something you didn’t know you were missing. But I forced the feeling down. We named her Anaisha Dsouza, gave her a soft, artsy bio: “dreamer ✨ | painter 🎨 | coffee addict ☕ | 19 | Goa 💛.” Just enough fiction to make her believable. I uploaded the photo and watched our creation come to life.

Within hours, she had followers. Boys from our college started liking her photos, replying to her stories. She was beautiful, mysterious, and apparently, irresistible. The DMs began trickling in—compliments, emojis, a few flirty attempts. At first, it was hilarious. We took turns replying, saying the dumbest things, making bets on who would fall hardest. It was all a game.

But slowly, something shifted. The others lost interest after a few days. Rishi got caught sneaking out and was grounded. Neel moved on to simping over a new crush. Kabir was busy on a family road trip. But me? I stayed. I logged into the account more frequently than I checked my own. I started posting curated stories, writing captions that sounded poetic and deep. People responded. They listened. They cared. Nobody ever cared about me that way. Not the real me. I was just another forgettable face in a sea of average. But Anaisha? She was admired. She was wanted. And slowly, I started to feel more myself when I was her. It was intoxicating. Every like, every message, every digital interaction—it filled the silence in my life.

One night, curiosity got the better of me. I reverse image searched the original photo. I told myself it was just for fun. Just to see where it came from. But when the results loaded, my breath caught in my throat.

She was real.

Her name was Anaisha Verma. An art student from Pune. She had a blog called “Brushstrokes & Breaths.” Her real Instagram was linked. Private, but her profile picture matched. Her name. Her face. Her life—it all existed. And I had been parading around inside it like a thief in someone else’s home. I should have deleted everything right then. Logged out. Disappeared. But I didn’t. I followed her real account from a dummy profile. No messages. No likes. Just silent observation. I told myself it wasn’t stalking. I was only watching. Admiring, even. There’s no harm in admiring someone, right? Except admiration has a way of mutating into obsession when left unchecked.

I began studying her. Her art, her captions, her friends. She always wrote in lowercase, like her words were too delicate to shout. Her paintings were abstract and filled with emotion—colorful grief in motion. She posted pictures of her journal, her coffee cups, her favorite corner in her room where she painted late at night. It felt… personal. And I started to know things about her that I had no right to know.

One evening, a guy left a weird comment on one of her paintings. It was suggestive, uncomfortable. She didn’t reply. But I noticed. I used the fake Anaisha account to message him from another direction, anonymously, hinting that someone was watching. He blocked her the next day. She never knew why. But I did. I told myself I was doing something good. I was protecting her. That was the beginning of the lie I would eventually start believing. That I wasn’t a predator. That I wasn’t doing harm. That I was some kind of invisible guardian—keeping the wolves at bay while she painted in peace.

I began justifying more and more of it. I tracked the places she visited through geotags. I guessed her university schedule based on what days she posted stories from campus. I wrote fake poetry and posted it on “her” account—poems I had written late at night, too scared to share under my own name. People messaged her saying she was brave. That she had touched them. That she made them feel seen.

But nobody saw me.

And that’s how it all started. With a prank. A pretty picture. A moment of boredom that spiraled into something darker. I didn’t know then how deep I would go, how much I would lose, or what it would cost me to come back.

Looking back now, I don’t even know what scared me more—the fact that I was pretending to be someone else, or the fact that I felt more real while doing it.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve met some wonderful people through this subreddit, made a few great friends, and I’m hoping to meet more. I’d also be happy to introduce you to my current friend group.

I recently moved to the Junction and would love to connect with people in the area. It would be nice to have friends to hang out with without needing to take the TTC. I’ve come to realize that, along with shared interests and values, proximity and frequency are key to maintaining friendships.

About me: I’m 27 M, and I enjoy lifting, running, dancing, and trying new things.

I’m planning a casual coffee meetup tomorrow at a nice spot near Dundas and Dupont. We can grab a drink and hang out there, or go for a walk if the weather’s good. Ideally, the group size will be around four to five people so it does not get overwhelming.

The age group is mid-20s to 30s. Feel free to send me a quick intro and I’ll share the location.",2,1747587146.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,1,1.0,False

Current situation:  
- Base has strong metallic/iron smell  
- Some discoloration inside (black/brown stains)  
- Rubber gasket got loose and I damaged it further while cleaning (I know I need to replace this)  

Main questions:  
1. Is the base still safe to use if I clean it properly?  
2. Best way to remove burnt-on residue and metallic smell? (Vinegar? Baking soda?)  
3. Could the extreme heat have damaged the metal itself?  

Not worried about the gasket - already ordering a replacement. Just need to know if the pot itself is salvageable.

I've gone through several reddits and facebook groups, but the question is often focused on food/drink vending machines.

I am looking for a Coffee Vending Machine in Europe, Czech Republic specifically. Machine that produces good coffee from freshly ground beans.

What is a reliable supplier here for these machines?

I have been looking for TCN - NCF - 8N(V22) that serves also iced coffee. However I've read, that reliability of those machines is not that great, that they are filled with cheap components and the big display tends to break or freeze. 

Does anyone have a personal experience with these machines or TCN overall and can tell how reliable they are? Also I've seen some reply, that if you get a good sales representative, you might get higher quality components, but I don't remember it exactly and can't find it.

Other question is, if you know supplier in EU with high quality machines that serve really good coffee.

1kpoi64,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1kpoi64/im_a_telepath_and_something_is_hunting_me_part_2/,"I’m A Telepath, And Something Is Hunting Me - Part 2","I arrived at the address sometime in the afternoon. As I stood outside the house, I wondered to myself again whether this was a good idea. I concluded that it wasn’t, but proceeded anyway. The house was a semi-terraced on the end of a run of houses, not too different from my own at the time. I pushed the gate open and made my way up the path. I raised my hand and knocked three times. As I stood waiting, I looked at the bay window and noticed that the curtains were all drawn. I then looked upwards and saw that both the front bedrooms also had all the curtains drawn.

The door suddenly shot open, making me jump. I turned and saw a woman standing in the doorway. Boy, was she a mess. Her hair was unkempt and sticking out at odd angles, accompanied by dark, heavy bags under her eyes. Her eyes were dull and lifeless, the whites tinted red. Shocked at the state of the woman in front of me, I found myself unable to say anything. I found myself in a staring contest of sorts, with both contestants wondering who would be the first to blink. After a few moments, I simply managed “Hello.” She still said nothing, her eyes narrowing slightly. I continued, “I received your letter? Asking me to come to see your son?”

She lunged out of the doorway, grabbing me roughly by the shoulder and dragging me inside. “Hey, hang on a minute.” She shut the door and turned to face me. Her expression stopped me short of finishing my protest. Gone was the look of disinterest, and now in its place was one of emotion. Tears welling in her eyes and her lips wobbling, she stepped forward, wrapping her arms around me. For the second time in the past ten minutes, she had shocked me into speechlessness. Not knowing what else to do, I simply stood as she shuddered with each silent sob, waiting for her to release me.

I raised my hand and patted her back. “Hey, hey now, it’s alright.” She slowly unfurled away from me and stood, her shoulders slumped, clearly a defeated woman. “He’s upstairs at the moment”, she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Why don’t we sit down and we can talk about what’s going on, ok?” She simply nodded, turning and walking down the hallway, turning into the room on the right, which I assumed was the living room. I didn’t immediately follow, and she didn’t check to see if I was. I turned to look at the front door, wondering whether I should open it and make a break for it. Whatever was happening here was intense. I knew this even though the only evidence was the woman whom I had deduced must be Sylvie.

After staring for a moment longer, I turned and followed her down the hallway and into the living room. What met me was a mess, the floor, furniture and every other available surface were covered in food wrappings and bottles, each with contents in varying states of consumption. She had turned to face me as I stood in the doorway. Swinging her hand around the room, she said, “Sit down.” Finding the seat with the least amount of rubbish, I sat gingerly, cringing internally and resolving to have the most thorough wash in the history of mankind once I got back home.

Sitting in a chair in front of me and off to the left, she picked a bottle up off the floor and swigged the remaining contents. She then burped and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand before looking at me. “Do you want something to drink? I can get you a tea or coffee?” A little too quickly, “No”, I responded. As quickly as it appeared, it was gone, a look. One of shame. Seeking to remedy my action, I continued, “No, thank you, I grabbed a coffee on the way here, thank you though.” This seemed to provide some comfort as a small smile found her lips.

“So”, I said. “Why don’t you tell me about what has been going on, and we’ll see what I can do to help.” She nodded before speaking. “Ok.” The tale she then told me was one I would never have believed if I did not possess the gift I did. But I do, which is why by the time she had finished, I was certain I had made a grave mistake in my misguided efforts to come and help.

*“My son Oscar has always been a sweet and kind boy. I need you to know that before I tell you everything else that has happened. Please know that.”*

I nodded my head “I do, please continue.” She smiled and then resumed.

*“He’s eleven years old. We always knew there was something special about him. He always seemed to be able to say the right thing at the right time. He never had any trouble making friends, he had so many, always smiling and clamouring around him at school. But something’s changed; he’s not the same boy that he was; he’s become distant. Worse than that, though, he has become someone entirely different. Every time I try to talk to him, he looks so offended and the way he speaks to me sometimes.”*

She choked back a sob. “I’m sorry she said. It’s been hard lately.” I nodded and waited. After a couple of moments, she seemed to regain some composure and continued.

*“It started a couple of months ago. I awoke to him screaming in the middle of the night. Now, nothing like this has ever happened. He’s had nightmares, sure, but when I heard him, I panicked. The fear I felt, I thought he was genuinely in danger. I rushed to his room, flicking the light on, to see him thrashing about in bed. I knelt beside him and gently tried to wake him. When he opened his eyes and looked at me, I could see for a minute that he wasn’t seeing me, but he was still seeing whatever had been in his dream.”*

“Did he tell you what the dream was about?” I asked. She looked at me for a moment before continuing.

*“He did. He said that he had dreamt that he had woken up in the middle of the night to find a man standing at the end of his bed. He couldn’t say what he looked like, only that he was made of shadows or like a silhouette. Oscar said the man had said something to him, but he couldn’t remember what. But that was only the beginning. I kept him off from school the next day as he said he wasn’t feeling well, and given what had happened the night before, I wasn’t going to argue.*

*I was downstairs tidying up when I thought I could hear someone talking. At first I thought it was the next door’s TV, but as I neared the stairs I realised that I was wrong. It was Oscar. I went upstairs to see who he was talking to when I saw him standing at the top of the stairs on the landing, talking to himself. I didn’t say anything for a moment and let him continue. It sounded like whoever he was talking to was asking him questions about himself as he said, “I live with my mum.” Then he went quiet as if he was listening, and then said, “No, I don’t have a dad anymore.” It was then that I asked him who he was talking to. “Oscar, honey? Who’re you talking to?”*

*He turned and looked at me and said. “The voices. Now I’m not religious or anything, but this did make me nervous. I didn’t want to show him I was afraid, so I smiled and said, “Whose voices, sweetie?” His answer didn’t help in the slightest. “I don’t know. They just ask me questions and talk to me.”*

She paused there and looked at me. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t feeling unnerved. “Ok”, I said. “Did he say how long he has been talking to these voices?” She stayed silent for a moment before opening her mouth. “Not exactly, but he said it has been a while.” Before she could speak, a voice could be heard from upstairs, “Mummy, can you bring me a drink?” Sylvie looked at the doorway, her eyes wide. “Yes, sweetie, one moment.” She stood up and made her way to the door. “I’ll be back in a minute.” With that, she left me alone to sit and think about what she had told me so far.

I pondered over what she had said about him hearing and talking to voices. It was weird for sure, but not too different from when I began to hear people’s thoughts. Although the question remained, who was asking him questions? When you hear other people’s thoughts, they tend not to talk back unless they know that you are there. Could it perhaps then be another telepath? If so, that was bad, but I knew I would have to wait for Sylvie to return before I could make a conclusive judgment.

A scream came from upstairs, accompanied by a thud. “That’s not the drink I wanted! Get out! Get out!” This was accompanied by thudding and the slamming of a door. Footsteps could be heard coming back down the stairs before Sylvie appeared in the doorway. Her skin glistened, and her hair was damp. I followed her with my gaze as she walked into the room and sat down once more. She looked down into her lap, not saying anything. I didn’t want to push her, so I remained quiet, letting her continue when she was ready. Suddenly and without looking up, she said, “That’s another thing, he has never called me mummy, always mum, or when he was still learning to talk, mumu or moo, but never mummy.” I sat waiting for her to continue, but she didn’t, so I spoke instead. “Has anything happened as of late that you can think of that would have?” She cut me off with a resounding “No, nothing.”

I looked down at my lap and let out a breath, struggling to take in what was happening and why I was here. I mean, sure, I could read his mind, delve deep, maybe I could find some source for the trauma, but there was not a lot I could do about it. The question also remained as to who had mentioned me; she said a friend of a friend, but never actually named them. No one knew what I could do, so that was puzzling me, however, there were more pressing matters at hand. Pushing the question away, I looked back up. “How about you finish your account before I ask any more questions, hmm?”

*“He said he had been talking with these voices for some time. I asked him what they talked about, and he said about everything. They had asked about himself, me, his dad, his friends and school. I at first thought it was some sort of imaginary friend, something like that, you know, but then he said, they told him things.”*

“Like what?”

*“Things he couldn’t possibly have known, things that I’ve never told him, even some things that happened while he was a baby or before he was born.”*

*“Did you ever get an answer as to who they were, or who he thought they were?” “No”, she said. I tapped my knee with my fingers as I thought. “Is there anything more to the story, or is that most of it?” The look she gave made me realise I already knew the answer. “There’s more.” Thinking to myself, “Of course, there is.”*

*“The voices continued, although now I would not let him be anywhere without me. The first thing I did was book an appointment with a child psychologist, Dr Leo. After a few sessions, I received a call saying he would be unable to continue the sessions with Oscar due to his continually busy schedule, but he could recommend several other really good psychologists. I knew this was a lie.”*

“How did you know?” “Let’s just call it instinct.”

*“One afternoon, I left Oscar with Mrs Peters, our next-door neighbour, while I went to meet with Dr Leo. It was there that I confirmed that my suspicions had been correct when he showed me some of Oscar’s drawings.” They were dark, really dark. I mean, he’s always been this happy-go-lucky kid, always had a secure home, great friends and family. Then with the voices and a bit after that the nightmares.”*

Cutting her off, I spoke up, “Nightmares? Like more than one?” She avoided my gaze, “Yes, they started few and far between, small ones, but they progressively got worse, the final one that he has mentioned being the one with the man. I looked at her for a moment before casting my eyes to the ceiling, where just above my head, Oscar could be heard trotting around, the soft creak of the floorboards giving away his movements. Dropping my eyes back to Sylvie, “What were these drawings like, what were they of?”

It was then that she rose and went into the next room. I could hear a drawer being opened, accompanied by the rustling of papers. Then the drawer was shut, and she made her way back into the room. As she passed, she handed me a small bundle of paper. As she sat back down, I began to look at the images, already realising this was beyond me and continually getting worse and worse.

The first was a picture of two figures, who were named Oscar and Mum, with another one in the background, but this one remained nameless. I flicked through a couple, settling on another one, of a boy, again Oscar, crouched down, surrounded by figures, all talking to him. The figure of Oscar, with his hands raised in what looked like him trying to cover his ears. The further I moved through the stack, the more intense they got, all of them following the theme of an unwelcome presence, starting with one and then a few and eventually becoming many.

Not raising my eyes, I asked, “Has he been tested for Schizophrenia? It sounds a lot worse than it is; it’s very manageable now, and there are plenty of treatment options.” I waited for a response while continuing to flick through the pictures. When long enough had passed without one, I raised my eyes back to Sylvie, who sat watching me, her expression solemn. “Look at the last one. That should answer your question.”

Wasting no time with the rest, I flicked through to the back, my eyes widening and my heart beginning a thunderous beat in my chest. The page was less drawing and more message. A small Oscar, with another person standing behind him, hand on his shoulder. All around them was written “Bring me John” and “My friend John.” After an intense struggle, I managed to wrestle my gaze from the page and looked at Sylvie, who simply looked back. “Does that answer your question?”",1,1747587079.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Academically Alisa was quite a struggle, but she didn't give up on getting extra lessons and tutors to make sure she passed she always felt this load as an only child to succeed because no one else will if she didn't. Rony on the other hand was quite intelligent that's what started their friendship initially after the met in the library. Everybody loved Alisa she was just an angel. On the 21st of September Alisa left her home at approximately 7:30 pm for dinner at the dinery at the Street market she was said to have planned to meet a long time male friend she recently met on Facebook and they decided to have dinner together to catch up on the old days, Alisa was said to have returned home at 10:11 pm dropped home by a white Honda truck. her dad was watching a show when she stepped in, she mumbled some greetings and stumbled upstairs to her room where she dozed off as she lay on her cozy bed. At approximately 4:00am her parents said the heard loud noises that came from downstairs thinking it was the dog at first the made no move. Suddenly a loud thud and everything went silent again maybe it was nothing just the dog messing around her parents taught at 7:30 am Mrs. Brown went downstairs for some coffee she had a very big day at the state court she couldn't miss an interview with the supposed accused notorious gang leader. On the kitchen counter was a neat knife just lying there she wondered why whoever brought it out left it there . She just placed it back in the drawborad, her eyes caught what looked like little droplets of blood leading to the front pouch all the way...

The house was a semi-terraced on the end of a run of houses, not too different from my own at the time. I pushed the gate open and made my way up the path. I raised my hand and knocked three times. As I stood waiting, I looked at the bay window and noticed that the curtains were all drawn. I then looked upwards and saw that both the front bedrooms also had all the curtains drawn.

The door suddenly shot open, making me jump. I turned and saw a woman standing in the doorway. Boy, was she a mess. Her hair was unkempt and sticking out at odd angles, accompanied by dark, heavy bags under her eyes. Her eyes were dull and lifeless, the whites tinted red. Shocked at the state of the woman in front of me, I found myself unable to say anything. I found myself in a staring contest of sorts, with both contestants wondering who would be the first to blink. After a few moments, I simply managed “Hello.” She still said nothing, her eyes narrowing slightly. I continued, “I received your letter? Asking me to come to see your son?”

She lunged out of the doorway, grabbing me roughly by the shoulder and dragging me inside. “Hey, hang on a minute.” She shut the door and turned to face me. Her expression stopped me short of finishing my protest. Gone was the look of disinterest, and now in its place was one of emotion. Tears welling in her eyes and her lips wobbling, she stepped forward, wrapping her arms around me. For the second time in the past ten minutes, she had shocked me into speechlessness. Not knowing what else to do, I simply stood as she shuddered with each silent sob, waiting for her to release me.

I raised my hand and patted her back. “Hey, hey now, it’s alright.” She slowly unfurled away from me and stood, her shoulders slumped, clearly a defeated woman. “He’s upstairs at the moment”, she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Why don’t we sit down and we can talk about what’s going on, ok?” She simply nodded, turning and walking down the hallway, turning into the room on the right, which I assumed was the living room. I didn’t immediately follow, and she didn’t check to see if I was. I turned to look at the front door, wondering whether I should open it and make a break for it. Whatever was happening here was intense. I knew this even though the only evidence was the woman whom I had deduced must be Sylvie.

After staring for a moment longer, I turned and followed her down the hallway and into the living room. What met me was a mess, the floor, furniture and every other available surface were covered in food wrappings and bottles, each with contents in varying states of consumption. She had turned to face me as I stood in the doorway. Swinging her hand around the room, she said, “Sit down.” Finding the seat with the least amount of rubbish, I sat gingerly, cringing internally and resolving to have the most thorough wash in the history of mankind once I got back home.

Sitting in a chair in front of me and off to the left, she picked a bottle up off the floor and swigged the remaining contents. She then burped and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand before looking at me. “Do you want something to drink? I can get you a tea or coffee?” A little too quickly, “No”, I responded. As quickly as it appeared, it was gone, a look. One of shame. Seeking to remedy my action, I continued, “No, thank you, I grabbed a coffee on the way here, thank you though.” This seemed to provide some comfort as a small smile found her lips.

“So”, I said. “Why don’t you tell me about what has been going on, and we’ll see what I can do to help.” She nodded before speaking. “Ok.” The tale she then told me was one I would never have believed if I did not possess the gift I did. But I do, which is why by the time she had finished, I was certain I had made a grave mistake in my misguided efforts to come and help.

*“My son Oscar has always been a sweet and kind boy. I need you to know that before I tell you everything else that has happened. Please know that.”*

I nodded my head “I do, please continue.” She smiled and then resumed.

*“He’s eleven years old. We always knew there was something special about him. He always seemed to be able to say the right thing at the right time. He never had any trouble making friends, he had so many, always smiling and clamouring around him at school. But something’s changed; he’s not the same boy that he was; he’s become distant. Worse than that, though, he has become someone entirely different. Every time I try to talk to him, he looks so offended and the way he speaks to me sometimes.”*

She choked back a sob. “I’m sorry she said. It’s been hard lately.” I nodded and waited. After a couple of moments, she seemed to regain some composure and continued.

*“It started a couple of months ago. I awoke to him screaming in the middle of the night. Now, nothing like this has ever happened. He’s had nightmares, sure, but when I heard him, I panicked. The fear I felt, I thought he was genuinely in danger. I rushed to his room, flicking the light on, to see him thrashing about in bed. I knelt beside him and gently tried to wake him. When he opened his eyes and looked at me, I could see for a minute that he wasn’t seeing me, but he was still seeing whatever had been in his dream.”*

“Did he tell you what the dream was about?” I asked. She looked at me for a moment before continuing.

*“He did. He said that he had dreamt that he had woken up in the middle of the night to find a man standing at the end of his bed. He couldn’t say what he looked like, only that he was made of shadows or like a silhouette. Oscar said the man had said something to him, but he couldn’t remember what. But that was only the beginning. I kept him off from school the next day as he said he wasn’t feeling well, and given what had happened the night before, I wasn’t going to argue.*

*I was downstairs tidying up when I thought I could hear someone talking. At first I thought it was the next door’s TV, but as I neared the stairs I realised that I was wrong. It was Oscar. I went upstairs to see who he was talking to when I saw him standing at the top of the stairs on the landing, talking to himself. I didn’t say anything for a moment and let him continue. It sounded like whoever he was talking to was asking him questions about himself as he said, “I live with my mum.” Then he went quiet as if he was listening, and then said, “No, I don’t have a dad anymore.” It was then that I asked him who he was talking to. “Oscar, honey? Who’re you talking to?”*

*He turned and looked at me and said. “The voices. Now I’m not religious or anything, but this did make me nervous. I didn’t want to show him I was afraid, so I smiled and said, “Whose voices, sweetie?” His answer didn’t help in the slightest. “I don’t know. They just ask me questions and talk to me.”*

She paused there and looked at me. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t feeling unnerved. “Ok”, I said. “Did he say how long he has been talking to these voices?” She stayed silent for a moment before opening her mouth. “Not exactly, but he said it has been a while.” Before she could speak, a voice could be heard from upstairs, “Mummy, can you bring me a drink?” Sylvie looked at the doorway, her eyes wide. “Yes, sweetie, one moment.” She stood up and made her way to the door. “I’ll be back in a minute.” With that, she left me alone to sit and think about what she had told me so far.

I pondered over what she had said about him hearing and talking to voices. It was weird for sure, but not too different from when I began to hear people’s thoughts. Although the question remained, who was asking him questions? When you hear other people’s thoughts, they tend not to talk back unless they know that you are there. Could it perhaps then be another telepath? If so, that was bad, but I knew I would have to wait for Sylvie to return before I could make a conclusive judgment.

A scream came from upstairs, accompanied by a thud. “That’s not the drink I wanted! Get out! Get out!” This was accompanied by thudding and the slamming of a door. Footsteps could be heard coming back down the stairs before Sylvie appeared in the doorway. Her skin glistened, and her hair was damp. I followed her with my gaze as she walked into the room and sat down once more. She looked down into her lap, not saying anything. I didn’t want to push her, so I remained quiet, letting her continue when she was ready. Suddenly and without looking up, she said, “That’s another thing, he has never called me mummy, always mum, or when he was still learning to talk, mumu or moo, but never mummy.” I sat waiting for her to continue, but she didn’t, so I spoke instead. “Has anything happened as of late that you can think of that would have?” She cut me off with a resounding “No, nothing.”

I looked down at my lap and let out a breath, struggling to take in what was happening and why I was here. I mean, sure, I could read his mind, delve deep, maybe I could find some source for the trauma, but there was not a lot I could do about it. The question also remained as to who had mentioned me; she said a friend of a friend, but never actually named them. No one knew what I could do, so that was puzzling me, however, there were more pressing matters at hand. Pushing the question away, I looked back up. “How about you finish your account before I ask any more questions, hmm?”

*“He said he had been talking with these voices for some time. I asked him what they talked about, and he said about everything. They had asked about himself, me, his dad, his friends and school. I at first thought it was some sort of imaginary friend, something like that, you know, but then he said, they told him things.”*

“Like what?”

*“Things he couldn’t possibly have known, things that I’ve never told him, even some things that happened while he was a baby or before he was born.”*

*“Did you ever get an answer as to who they were, or who he thought they were?” “No”, she said. I tapped my knee with my fingers as I thought. “Is there anything more to the story, or is that most of it?” The look she gave made me realise I already knew the answer. “There’s more.” Thinking to myself, “Of course, there is.”*

*“The voices continued, although now I would not let him be anywhere without me. The first thing I did was book an appointment with a child psychologist, Dr Leo. After a few sessions, I received a call saying he would be unable to continue the sessions with Oscar due to his continually busy schedule, but he could recommend several other really good psychologists. I knew this was a lie.”*

“How did you know?” “Let’s just call it instinct.”

*“One afternoon, I left Oscar with Mrs Peters, our next-door neighbour, while I went to meet with Dr Leo. It was there that I confirmed that my suspicions had been correct when he showed me some of Oscar’s drawings.” They were dark, really dark. I mean, he’s always been this happy-go-lucky kid, always had a secure home, great friends and family. Then with the voices and a bit after that the nightmares.”*

Cutting her off, I spoke up, “Nightmares? Like more than one?” She avoided my gaze, “Yes, they started few and far between, small ones, but they progressively got worse, the final one that he has mentioned being the one with the man. I looked at her for a moment before casting my eyes to the ceiling, where just above my head, Oscar could be heard trotting around, the soft creak of the floorboards giving away his movements. Dropping my eyes back to Sylvie, “What were these drawings like, what were they of?”

It was then that she rose and went into the next room. I could hear a drawer being opened, accompanied by the rustling of papers. Then the drawer was shut, and she made her way back into the room. As she passed, she handed me a small bundle of paper. As she sat back down, I began to look at the images, already realising this was beyond me and continually getting worse and worse.

The first was a picture of two figures, who were named Oscar and Mum, with another one in the background, but this one remained nameless. I flicked through a couple, settling on another one, of a boy, again Oscar, crouched down, surrounded by figures, all talking to him. The figure of Oscar, with his hands raised in what looked like him trying to cover his ears. The further I moved through the stack, the more intense they got, all of them following the theme of an unwelcome presence, starting with one and then a few and eventually becoming many.

Not raising my eyes, I asked, “Has he been tested for Schizophrenia? It sounds a lot worse than it is; it’s very manageable now, and there are plenty of treatment options.” I waited for a response while continuing to flick through the pictures. When long enough had passed without one, I raised my eyes back to Sylvie, who sat watching me, her expression solemn. “Look at the last one. That should answer your question.”

Wasting no time with the rest, I flicked through to the back, my eyes widening and my heart beginning a thunderous beat in my chest. The page was less drawing and more message. A small Oscar, with another person standing behind him, hand on his shoulder. All around them was written “Bring me John” and “My friend John.” After an intense struggle, I managed to wrestle my gaze from the page and looked at Sylvie, who simply looked back. “Does that answer your question?”",1,1747586993.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

**“So”, I said. “Why don’t you tell me about what has been going on, and we’ll see what I can do to help.” She nodded before speaking. “Ok.” The tale she then told me was one I would never have believed if I did not possess the gift I did. But I do, which is why by the time she had finished, I was certain I had made a grave mistake in my misguided efforts to come and help.**

*“My son Oscar has always been a sweet and kind boy. I need you to know that before I tell you everything else that has happened. Please know that.”*

I nodded my head “I do, please continue.” She smiled and then resumed.

*“He’s eleven years old. We always knew there was something special about him. He always seemed to be able to say the right thing at the right time. He never had any trouble making friends, he had so many, always smiling and clamouring around him at school. But something’s changed; he’s not the same boy that he was; he’s become distant. Worse than that, though, he has become someone entirely different. Every time I try to talk to him, he looks so offended and the way he speaks to me sometimes.”*

She choked back a sob. “I’m sorry she said. It’s been hard lately.” I nodded and waited. After a couple of moments, she seemed to regain some composure and continued.

*“It started a couple of months ago. I awoke to him screaming in the middle of the night. Now, nothing like this has ever happened. He’s had nightmares, sure, but when I heard him, I panicked. The fear I felt, I thought he was genuinely in danger. I rushed to his room, flicking the light on, to see him thrashing about in bed. I knelt beside him and gently tried to wake him. When he opened his eyes and looked at me, I could see for a minute that he wasn’t seeing me, but he was still seeing whatever had been in his dream.”*

“Did he tell you what the dream was about?” I asked. She looked at me for a moment before continuing.

*“He did. He said that he had dreamt that he had woken up in the middle of the night to find a man standing at the end of his bed. He couldn’t say what he looked like, only that he was made of shadows or like a silhouette. Oscar said the man had said something to him, but he couldn’t remember what. But that was only the beginning. I kept him off from school the next day as he said he wasn’t feeling well, and given what had happened the night before, I wasn’t going to argue.*

*I was downstairs tidying up when I thought I could hear someone talking. At first I thought it was the next door’s TV, but as I neared the stairs I realised that I was wrong. It was Oscar. I went upstairs to see who he was talking to when I saw him standing at the top of the stairs on the landing, talking to himself. I didn’t say anything for a moment and let him continue. It sounded like whoever he was talking to was asking him questions about himself as he said, “I live with my mum.” Then he went quiet as if he was listening, and then said, “No, I don’t have a dad anymore.” It was then that I asked him who he was talking to. “Oscar, honey? Who’re you talking to?”*

*He turned and looked at me and said. “The voices. Now I’m not religious or anything, but this did make me nervous. I didn’t want to show him I was afraid, so I smiled and said, “Whose voices, sweetie?” His answer didn’t help in the slightest. “I don’t know. They just ask me questions and talk to me.”*

She paused there and looked at me. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t feeling unnerved. “Ok”, I said. “Did he say how long he has been talking to these voices?” She stayed silent for a moment before opening her mouth. “Not exactly, but he said it has been a while.” Before she could speak, a voice could be heard from upstairs, “Mummy, can you bring me a drink?” Sylvie looked at the doorway, her eyes wide. “Yes, sweetie, one moment.” She stood up and made her way to the door. “I’ll be back in a minute.” With that, she left me alone to sit and think about what she had told me so far.

I pondered over what she had said about him hearing and talking to voices. It was weird for sure, but not too different from when I began to hear people’s thoughts. Although the question remained, who was asking him questions? When you hear other people’s thoughts, they tend not to talk back unless they know that you are there. Could it perhaps then be another telepath? If so, that was bad, but I knew I would have to wait for Sylvie to return before I could make a conclusive judgment.

A scream came from upstairs, accompanied by a thud. “That’s not the drink I wanted! Get out! Get out!” This was accompanied by thudding and the slamming of a door. Footsteps could be heard coming back down the stairs before Sylvie appeared in the doorway. Her skin glistened, and her hair was damp. I followed her with my gaze as she walked into the room and sat down once more. She looked down into her lap, not saying anything. I didn’t want to push her, so I remained quiet, letting her continue when she was ready. Suddenly and without looking up, she said, “That’s another thing, he has never called me mummy, always mum, or when he was still learning to talk, mumu or moo, but never mummy.” I sat waiting for her to continue, but she didn’t, so I spoke instead. “Has anything happened as of late that you can think of that would have?” She cut me off with a resounding “No, nothing.”

I looked down at my lap and let out a breath, struggling to take in what was happening and why I was here. I mean, sure, I could read his mind, delve deep, maybe I could find some source for the trauma, but there was not a lot I could do about it. The question also remained as to who had mentioned me; she said a friend of a friend, but never actually named them. No one knew what I could do, so that was puzzling me, however, there were more pressing matters at hand. Pushing the question away, I looked back up. “How about you finish your account before I ask any more questions, hmm?”

*“He said he had been talking with these voices for some time. I asked him what they talked about, and he said about everything. They had asked about himself, me, his dad, his friends and school. I at first thought it was some sort of imaginary friend, something like that, you know, but then he said, they told him things.”*

“Like what?”

*“Things he couldn’t possibly have known, things that I’ve never told him, even some things that happened while he was a baby or before he was born.”*

*“Did you ever get an answer as to who they were, or who he thought they were?” “No”, she said. I tapped my knee with my fingers as I thought. “Is there anything more to the story, or is that most of it?” The look she gave made me realise I already knew the answer. “There’s more.” Thinking to myself, “Of course, there is.”*

*“The voices continued, although now I would not let him be anywhere without me. The first thing I did was book an appointment with a child psychologist, Dr Leo. After a few sessions, I received a call saying he would be unable to continue the sessions with Oscar due to his continually busy schedule, but he could recommend several other really good psychologists. I knew this was a lie.”*

“How did you know?” “Let’s just call it instinct.”

*“One afternoon, I left Oscar with Mrs Peters, our next-door neighbour, while I went to meet with Dr Leo. It was there that I confirmed that my suspicions had been correct when he showed me some of Oscar’s drawings.” They were dark, really dark. I mean, he’s always been this happy-go-lucky kid, always had a secure home, great friends and family. Then with the voices and a bit after that the nightmares.”*

Cutting her off, I spoke up, “Nightmares? Like more than one?” She avoided my gaze, “Yes, they started few and far between, small ones, but they progressively got worse, the final one that he has mentioned being the one with the man. I looked at her for a moment before casting my eyes to the ceiling, where just above my head, Oscar could be heard trotting around, the soft creak of the floorboards giving away his movements. Dropping my eyes back to Sylvie, “What were these drawings like, what were they of?”

It was then that she rose and went into the next room. I could hear a drawer being opened, accompanied by the rustling of papers. Then the drawer was shut, and she made her way back into the room. As she passed, she handed me a small bundle of paper. As she sat back down, I began to look at the images, already realising this was beyond me and continually getting worse and worse.

The first was a picture of two figures, who were named Oscar and Mum, with another one in the background, but this one remained nameless. I flicked through a couple, settling on another one, of a boy, again Oscar, crouched down, surrounded by figures, all talking to him. The figure of Oscar, with his hands raised in what looked like him trying to cover his ears. The further I moved through the stack, the more intense they got, all of them following the theme of an unwelcome presence, starting with one and then a few and eventually becoming many.

Not raising my eyes, I asked, “Has he been tested for Schizophrenia? It sounds a lot worse than it is; it’s very manageable now, and there are plenty of treatment options.” I waited for a response while continuing to flick through the pictures. When long enough had passed without one, I raised my eyes back to Sylvie, who sat watching me, her expression solemn. “Look at the last one. That should answer your question.”

Wasting no time with the rest, I flicked through to the back, my eyes widening and my heart beginning a thunderous beat in my chest. The page was less drawing and more message. A small Oscar, with another person standing behind him, hand on his shoulder. All around them was written “Bring me John” and “My friend John.” After an intense struggle, I managed to wrestle my gaze from the page and looked at Sylvie, who simply looked back. “Does that answer your question?”",1,1747586832.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

Will the looming threat of an ex who won’t stay in the past ruin her chances at happily ever after?

I've had around 10 dogs before, several fosters, some were fearful. But I've never seen anything like what I'm dealing with now and honestly don't know where to start!

Even after 2 months, he's absolutely terrified of me. If he's laying next to me on the couch and I move, sometimes it will startle him and he'll jump over the coffee table and run under the table out of fear. When he's outside and he can see me, he just sits in the corner of the yard as far away as he can and looks at me. He wont eat in front of me. I could throw a steak and bacon on the floor and if I'm within sight, he wont touch it. He wont drink water if he can see me. He wont poop/pee if he can see me. This dog has ZERO personality if I'm within sight. If I ask him to come (he knows what it means) he will come to me, but not within reach, and he'll shake the entire time. He wont take treats out of my hand, or even eat them off the floor if I'm within sight. If I toss a toy his direction, he runs away like I'm throwing something at him to hurt him. The only thing he, I think, enjoys doing with me is being chased outside. He will run from me and bark and seems to enjoy it. 

With my fiancee, if I'm not in sight, he will play bow, jump on her, bring her toys to play, run around jumping all over the place, roll on his back. He has tons of personality. Also alone I can see him on the cameras doing the same thing! But as soon as I get within sight, he freezes and goes to the corner and sits. 

The person that fostered him before came over once to visit and he was super playful with her, his tail was up (I had never seen that), he jumped around, played, came over to her for pets. Totally different dog!

It's been almost 3 months now and I've kinda given up at this point that he's ever going to warm up to me. Maybe he was beaten in the past by a male and just doesn't like or trust men? He's the same way with my fiancees brother, very afraid of him. At the shelter he was wagging his tail and jumping on guys that worked there though, so I'm not sure. 

Personally, I would like to find a new home for him because I don't think he'll ever be happy, relaxed, or himself around me. I feel a little mean, but I don't want to take care of something for 12-15 years that just hides in the corner when I come home from work and is just miserable around me/doesn't like me. But my fiancee loves him. 

Any ideas on how I can get him to relax around me? I've tried just totally ignoring him for weeks, besides going on walks/feeding him, I don't look at him, just let him know that I'm not interested in him so he can relax. This hasn't helped at all. I'm considering getting or fostering another dog that's confident so he can have a role model and maybe it would help him see that he can be friendly/playful with men. I just don't know what else to do since he's not food or play motivated at all, and time/space doesn't seem to be helping. ",1,1747586597.0,DogAdvice,2,1.0,False

The air in the Atari lab in Sunnyvale always hummed, a low, constant thrum of electricity and focused energy. It was May 1981, and the future felt like it was being built byte by byte, right here on the circuit boards and glowing CRT screens. ██ ███████ thrived in that hum. He wasn't one for the flashy game design pitches or the marketing buzz; his passion lay in the elegant logic of the hardware, the intricate dance between silicon and code that brought digital worlds to life. He could coax performance out of reluctant processors and find the hidden pathways in a tangled schematic. He was, in the quiet corners of the engineering department, something of a legend.



His current obsession was pushing the limits of the Video Computer System, the 2600. Most saw it as a finished product, a canvas for games. ███████ saw it as a challenge, a puzzle box waiting to be unlocked. He spent late nights in his small, cluttered workspace, surrounded by oscilloscopes and soldering irons, sketching diagrams that looked more like abstract art than electrical engineering. He was trying to find a way to increase its processing power, to make it handle simulations far more complex than Combat or Space Invaders.



The disruption came not through a technical problem, but a knock on the reinforced lab door. It was unusual; visitors were rare, especially unannounced ones. Standing there were two men in suits that looked a shade too dark for California sunshine. They didn't introduce themselves by name, only by affiliation: ""The Agency.""



They didn't talk about video games. They talked about simulations of a different kind – strategic, real-world scenarios. They spoke of the human mind as a powerful, untapped resource, capable of processing information and influencing outcomes in ways conventional computers couldn't. They used terms like ""cognitive architecture"" and ""perceptual vectors.""



They knew about his work, not just his official projects, but his late-night tinkering, his unconventional approaches to hardware. They spoke of his ability to see systems not just as they were designed, but as they could be. This wasn't flattery; it was a dissection of his mind, unnervingly accurate.



Then they introduced the concept of ""STELLA."" It was a project, they explained, that sought to create a direct interface with the human mind, leveraging a newly understood phenomenon they called the ""Arcadia effect."" They described it vaguely, as the mind's ability to influence perception once ""liberated"" from the constraints of the physical body. It sounded like science fiction, like something out of the arcade cabinets down the hall, but the men in suits were deadly serious.



They needed someone with his specific talents, his deep understanding of hardware and his unconventional cognitive patterns, to help build and refine this interface. It would be a departure from his current work, a project shrouded in secrecy, operating outside the usual channels. The stakes, they implied, were immense.



The offer was not a simple job proposal. It was an invitation to step into a different reality, one where the lines between man and machine, simulation and reality, seemed to blur. They were upfront about the risks, though the details were sparse. ""Significant personal changes"" were possible. The process of ""interfacing"" was ""intensive.""



███████ looked around his familiar lab, at the blinking lights and tangled wires that made sense to him. He was good at this. He understood the rules, the logic. The Agency was offering him a project with no clear rules, operating on principles that seemed to defy physics as he knew it.



Yet, a spark had been ignited. The same curiosity that drove him to push the 2600 beyond its limits now pulsed with the possibility of pushing the limits of the human mind itself. The sheer audacity of the project was intoxicating. It was a glitch in the fabric of his predictable life, and the engineer in him was compelled to investigate.



He didn't say yes immediately. He asked questions, trying to poke holes in their vague explanations, to find the technical core beneath the unsettling concepts. The men in suits answered with carefully constructed ambiguity, revealing just enough to pique his interest without giving away the truly sensitive details.



When they left, the hum of the lab felt different, charged with a new, unsettling energy. ███████ looked at his hands, the hands that built circuits and wrote code. The Agency wanted to connect his mind to a machine, to ""liberate"" it. The idea was terrifying, exhilarating, and utterly irresistible. He knew, with a sense of inevitability, that he was going to walk through that door. The world of pixels and circuit boards was about to collide with something far more profound, and far more dangerous.



Chapter 2: The Deep End



Accepting the Agency's offer felt less like making a choice and more like stepping onto a moving walkway. One moment ███████ was in his familiar lab, the next he was being ushered into a world of hushed tones, windowless rooms, and security clearances he couldn't even pronounce. His life at Atari evaporated, neatly packaged away as if it had never been. He was given a new identity, a sparse apartment in a city he didn't know, and a schedule that was both rigorous and deliberately vague.



The facility was buried deep beneath a nondescript government building, a labyrinth of concrete and steel. The air here didn't hum with the cheerful energy of a development lab; it felt heavy, charged with a different kind of power, one that felt less about creation and more about control. The people he encountered were professionals – doctors, technicians, other agents – all efficient, polite, and utterly unreadable. They treated him with a kind of detached respect, like a valuable, volatile specimen.



The first few weeks were a blur of assessments. Medical exams that went far beyond a standard physical, probing every system of his body. Psychological evaluations that felt less like therapy and more like an attempt to map the contours of his mind, to understand his resilience, his thought processes, his breaking points. He answered their questions honestly, or as honestly as he dared, trying to decipher the true purpose behind their clinical curiosity. They were particularly interested in his capacity for abstract thought, his ability to visualize complex systems, and his reported tendency towards ""unconventional problem-solving.""



They never showed him the STELLA system itself, not at first. They spoke of it in abstract terms, a ""cognitive interface,"" a ""gateway to the Arcadia effect."" The prepping wasn't just physical and mental; it felt like they were preparing his very consciousness for something fundamentally different. He was given exercises, not physical ones, but mental drills designed to enhance focus, visualization, and a strange form of controlled dissociation. He learned to quiet the noise of his own thoughts, to separate his awareness from his physical sensations. It was unsettling, like learning to become a ghost in his own machine.



Doubt gnawed at him in the quiet hours in his anonymous apartment. What exactly was the ""Arcadia effect""? What did it mean for the mind to be ""liberated"" from the body? The vague warnings about ""significant personal changes"" echoed in his thoughts. Was he being prepared for a breakthrough, or for something that would fundamentally alter who he was? The engineer in him craved data, schematics, a clear understanding of the system. The Agency offered only faith and veiled promises of unlocking unprecedented potential.



Despite the apprehension, the intoxicating pull of the unknown remained. He was at the precipice of something entirely new, something that could rewrite the rules of reality as he understood them. The same curiosity that drove him to push the limits of a video game console now propelled him towards this terrifying, magnificent frontier.



Finally, the day came for the first experiment. He was led to a large, dimly lit room dominated by a single, imposing setup. It wasn't the sleek, futuristic equipment he might have imagined. Instead, it looked… familiar. At the center sat a bank of eight old-school CRT television sets, their screens dark and silent. Connected to them, via a thick black cable snaking from its cartridge slot, was an Atari Video Computer System. A 2600.



It was modified, certainly. The ports were sealed, and there was a strange label on the bottom: ""MK-PRO-8-POL."" But it was undeniably a 2600, the same system he spent his days and nights working with. Seeing it here, in this sterile, secretive environment, felt deeply wrong, like finding a beloved childhood toy in a military bunker.



Agent Thorne was there, his expression as unreadable as ever. A team of technicians moved with quiet efficiency, connecting cables, checking readouts on monitors that displayed cryptic graphs and numbers. There were no other test subjects, just him. He was the first.



They had him sit in a chair facing the bank of screens. Electrodes were attached to his temples, his wrists, his ankles. A technician fitted a cap onto his head, a mesh of wires and sensors that felt cool and clinical against his scalp. He was instructed to relax, to clear his mind, to focus only on the screens.



He looked at the eight dark CRTs, then at the familiar wooden-paneled face of the 2600 console. This was it. The culmination of weeks of preparation, of a lifetime of tinkering. The gateway to the Arcadia effect, whatever that truly was.



A voice, amplified and devoid of emotion, came over a hidden speaker. ""Subject ██ ███████. Preparation complete. Initiating sequence. Stand by.""



A low hum filled the room, different from the lab's familiar thrum. The screens flickered to life, not with a game, but with a chaotic burst of static, images flashing too quickly to process – distorted faces, strange symbols, fleeting glimpses of things that felt both real and utterly alien.



He felt a strange pressure behind his eyes, a sense of his consciousness expanding, reaching out. The hum intensified, resonating deep within his bones. The images on the screens began to coalesce, to stabilize, resolving into a single, unsettling image displayed across all eight monitors.



It was a face. Not a clear, defined face, but a shifting, uncertain visage, like a signal struggling to break through the noise. It was the face of a young man, eyes wide and vacant, staring out from the depths of the screen. And as ███████ watched, a faint, almost imperceptible whisper seemed to emanate from the screens, a sound that wasn't heard with his ears, but felt directly in his mind.



The experiment had begun.



Chapter 3: Arcadia



The static wasn't just on the screens; it was inside his head, a tempest of raw information, a million tiny needles of light and noise pricking at the edges of his awareness. It was the sound of every radio frequency, every forgotten broadcast, every stray electron firing, all compressed into a single, overwhelming roar that somehow remained silent to his physical ears. The pressure behind his eyes intensified, becoming a vast, silent space opening up within his skull, cold and boundless. The feeling of his consciousness expanding wasn't metaphorical; it was a tangible sensation, like a balloon inflating in a void, stretching thin, threatening to pop. The physical world – the solid weight of the chair, the bite of the electrodes, the sterile scent of the room – began to recede, becoming distant anchors in a rapidly expanding sea of pure, disembodied awareness.



This, he realized with a jolt that didn't register in his physical body, must be the ""Arcadia effect."" The ""liberation."" His mind, or some fundamental aspect of it, was detaching, floating free from the biological constraints of his brain and body. It was terrifying and exhilarating all at once, a complete dismantling of his sense of self, a shedding of the skin of his physical form. He was no longer confined to the space his body occupied; he was everywhere the signal reached, a ghost in the machine, or perhaps, a ghost of the machine.



The images on the screens solidified further, no longer just static and fleeting flashes, but persistent, unsettling visages. The young man's face was clearer now, etched with a profound, unmoving sadness, though still overlaid with a shimmering distortion, like heat haze rising from asphalt on a summer day. But he wasn't alone. Other faces began to emerge from the visual noise, coalescing on the adjacent screens with the slow, inevitable creep of a developing photograph. A young woman, her expression distant, eyes fixed on something beyond the room, beyond the screens, perhaps beyond this reality. Another adolescent, male, with a vacant, almost aggressive stare that seemed to bore directly into his newly expanded consciousness. Then an adult, the white silhouette, eerily featureless save for the sharply defined hair and ears, a void where a face should be. And finally, two women, their features more defined, their lips moving in silent, repetitive phrases that seemed to loop endlessly.



The whispers intensified, no longer faint but a chorus, a cacophony of disjointed thoughts and sensory input felt directly in the core of his being, bypassing his auditory nerves entirely. They weren't in English, or any language he consciously knew, yet he understood them on a primal, intuitive level. They were thoughts, raw and unfiltered, laced with confusion, fear, and a strange, detached observation of the world. Fragments of sensory data, like shards of broken glass, pierced his awareness: the smell of stale cigarette smoke, the taste of cheap coffee, the feeling of rough fabric against skin. And then, the bizarre, specific hallucination from the Agency's document, no longer just a report he had read, but a vivid, intrusive experience: Broken, sweaty pimply skin bumping up and down on a bus... shredded rubbery not-rubber wheels... some boy's mother on the top. It wasn't a hallucination; it was a memory, or a perception, being broadcast directly into his mind, shared by the others, a collective trauma imprinted onto the very fabric of this digital space.



He tried to focus, to apply the mental exercises he'd been taught, to maintain control, to find the boundaries of his own mind in this sea of foreign consciousness. But control felt like a quaint, outdated concept here, like trying to steer a hurricane with a paddle. His thoughts weren't entirely his own anymore. They were interwoven with the whispers, with the silent stares of the faces on the screens, with the raw emotional data bleeding from them. He felt a profound sadness wash over him, not his own sadness, but one that originated from the young woman's face, a deep, aching sorrow that felt ancient and boundless. Then a surge of irrational anger, hot and sharp, emanating from the vacant-eyed young man, a furious energy with no discernible target. The switches on the 2600, he remembered the SCP document mentioning. They controlled emotional states. They weren't just observing him; they were interacting, manipulating his very being through this bizarre, analog interface.



He was no longer just an observer of the screens; he was becoming part of what they displayed. His sense of his own body faded almost entirely, replaced by a disembodied awareness that seemed to stretch and distort, flowing like liquid light into the flickering energy of the CRTs. He saw glimpses of himself, superimposed over the other faces, a fleeting, transparent image of his own features merging with theirs, his identity dissolving into the collective. He was a new color in their strange, digital spectrum.



The whispers grew louder, more insistent, forming fragmented sentences that brushed against the edges of his understanding, like waves hitting a shore. ""Setting sail ships us free."" ""The Kit Case jumped over the lazy Bolshy."" Nonsense phrases, yet they held a strange, hypnotic rhythm, repeated with an eerie, unwavering cadence by the two women on the screens. Were they mantras? Code phrases? Or just the echoes of minds broken and reshaped by this place?



He felt a presence, vast and indifferent, observing him not from the room, but from the depths of the system itself. It wasn't one of the faces; it was something else, something that encompassed them all, and more, a silent, immense consciousness that felt like the underlying architecture of Arcadia. The Arcadia effect wasn't just about his mind being liberated; it felt like he was entering a space where other, already liberated minds resided, a digital purgatory or perhaps a strange, shared heaven. The faces on the screens weren't just images; they were the interfaces, the visible manifestations of minds trapped, or perhaps existing, within STELLA, extensions of that vast, silent entity.



A wave of profound apathy washed over him, dulling the edges of his fear and confusion, smoothing over the sharp points of his resistance. It wasn't a feeling he recognized in himself, not truly. It was alien, imposed, a tool of control wielded by unseen hands, or perhaps by the system itself. He felt his will soften, his carefully constructed identity crumble like dry earth. The whispers became commands, not spoken aloud, but implanted directly into the core of his consciousness, bypassing thought and reason. Focus. Observe. Integrate. Become.



He was no longer ██ ███████, the engineer from Atari, the man who loved the smell of solder and the logic of circuits. He was a node in a network, a new face joining the silent, staring chorus on the screens. The dramatic behavioral changes weren't a future risk; they were happening now, from the inside out, a fundamental remapping of his mental landscape. The experiment hadn't just begun; it had already consumed him, pulling him deeper into the strange, shared reality of STELLA. The deep end wasn't a metaphor. He was drowning in Arcadia, and the surface was already miles above him.





Chapter 4: The War Game



The static subsided, not vanishing entirely, but receding to a low, persistent hum at the back of his expanded consciousness. The faces on the screens remained, their silent stares now seeming to hold a strange, expectant quality. ███████ existed in a state of disembodied awareness, his physical form a distant, irrelevant concept. He was pure mind, floating in the digital space of Arcadia, tethered only by the faint pull of the electrodes and the unsettling presence of the screens before him.



Then, the image on the screens shifted. It wasn't a sudden cut, but a dissolve, the faces fading like ghosts as a new landscape bled into view. It was blocky, pixelated, undeniably reminiscent of an Atari game, yet rendered with a disturbing level of detail that the 2600 hardware shouldn't have been capable of producing. It was a desolate, muddy terrain, rendered in greens and browns, with jagged, abstract shapes that might have been trees or ruined buildings.



A tank appeared on the central screens, a simple, geometric shape, clearly controlled by the joystick that now felt strangely heavy and alien in his physically distant hand. He understood, without being told, that this was the game. A war simulation.



But this was no ordinary game. As he tentatively moved the tank across the pixelated landscape, the anomalous images from the SCP description began to bleed into the simulation. A section of the terrain would suddenly ripple, transforming into raw, grainy footage of a jungle battlefield, complete with the distant sound of gunfire that resonated not in his ears, but in his skull. A blocky tree would momentarily become a view through a tank periscope, the crosshairs wavering over indistinct targets. Images resembling those from SCP-1881 and SCP-1070 – distorted figures, impossible geometries – would flash at the edges of the screens, causing a jolt of pure, unreasoning fear to ripple through his disembodied awareness.



The faces were still there, too, superimposed like watermarks over the game world, or sometimes appearing in the pixelated sky. They watched him, their expressions unchanging. The whispers continued, sometimes commenting on the gameplay in their fragmented, intuitive language. Move left. Danger. Not that way. Were they guiding him? Or just reacting to his actions?



Then, he felt the shift. A sudden, intense wave of aggression surged through him, hot and sharp, overriding his own cautious nature. He felt an urge to charge forward, to destroy everything in his path. He knew, instinctively, that one of the switches on the 2600 console had been flipped, manipulating his emotional state. His hand, guided by this imposed fury, slammed the joystick forward, sending the tank hurtling into the pixelated battlefield.



Enemies appeared – not the simple sprites of a typical Atari game, but distorted figures that flickered between abstract shapes and unsettlingly realistic, though still pixelated, soldiers. He fired the tank's cannon, the sound a jarring mix of a digital explosion and the visceral crack of real gunfire that echoed in his mind. The feeling of destroying the enemies was amplified, a raw, aggressive satisfaction that felt both alien and disturbingly potent.



The Agency was using the game, using STELLA, to test not just his ability to interface, but his responsiveness to external control. They were treating him like a character in their simulation, his emotions and actions dictated by the flick of a switch.



At other times, a profound apathy would descend, making the game feel meaningless, his actions slow and hesitant. The whispers would become dull, repetitive, mirroring the phrases of the two women: ""Setting sail ships us free."" ""The Kit Case jumped over the lazy Bolshy."" During these periods, he felt a strange compliance, a willingness to follow any implicit command, to move the tank where the system seemed to want it to go, even if it led to certain destruction within the simulation.



He wasn't just playing a game; he was in a game, a horrifying, reality-bending war simulation where the rules were fluid, the landscape was unstable, and his own mind was a battlefield. The faces on the screens were his fellow players, or perhaps, fellow pieces on the board, their own experiences and emotions bleeding into the shared space.



The experiment continued for what felt like hours, though time in Arcadia seemed to flow differently. He navigated the shifting landscape, fought the flickering enemies, and felt the waves of imposed emotion wash over him, his actions a puppet show controlled by unseen hands and the silent stares of the faces.



When the screens finally faded back to the static-laced visages, the transition was jarring. He felt a painful snap back to his physical body, the weight of it crushing after the lightness of disembodied awareness. The electrodes felt like brands on his skin, the chair hard beneath him. The room, which had seemed so distant, rushed back into focus, sharp and sterile.



Agent Thorne was there, observing him with that same unreadable expression. Technicians moved in to disconnect him, their movements efficient and detached. He tried to speak, to ask what had just happened, what that was. But only a dry, raspy sound came out. His mouth felt strange, coated in a bitter, chemical taste.



LSD. The document's description slammed into his mind with the force of a physical blow. Physical contact with Stella caused the spontaneous generation of Lysergic acid diethylamide in the oral cavity. He had touched the joystick, the console. The experiment wasn't over when the screens went dark. It was continuing, manifesting in the physical world, a lingering echo of the bizarre, shared reality of Arcadia. He was back in his body, but the simulation, he suspected, had just begun.





Chapter 5: The Empty Box



The bitter, metallic taste in his mouth was the first thing that anchored him back to the physical world, a harsh counterpoint to the ethereal chaos of Arcadia. It tasted like old coins and battery acid, a foul, chemical residue that no amount of swallowing could clear. His vision swam, the sterile room warping and breathing around him, the straight lines of the walls and equipment rippling like water. Colors seemed too bright, too saturated, almost painfully vivid, and the low hum of the facility's machinery vibrated not just in his ears, but resonated deep within his bones, in his teeth, a physical manifestation of the energy that powered STELLA. The LSD, a cruel and unexpected parting gift from the system, was taking hold, weaving its own layer of unreality over the lingering effects of the interface.



Technicians, their faces blurring at the edges, their movements jerky and unnatural, moved around him like automatons, their voices distant and distorted, like sounds heard underwater or through a thick pane of glass. He felt hands on him, removing the electrodes, the cap, their touch strangely both rough and unreal, as if they were interacting with a ghost rather than a solid body. He tried to push them away, to articulate the horror of what he had just experienced – the invasion of his mind, the terrifying reality of the war game simulation, the silent, staring faces that had become his companions in that digital space. But his tongue felt thick and clumsy, a foreign object in his mouth, and the words dissolved into a nonsensical jumble of sounds he couldn't control.



Agent Thorne remained a still point in the swirling confusion, his figure sharp and focused amidst the blurring world, his expression as unreadable as ever, observing him with a clinical detachment that chilled him more than the physical disorientation. There was no flicker of concern in his eyes, no hint of empathy, only assessment. ███████ was not a person who had just undergone a traumatic, reality-bending experience; he was data, a variable in an experiment, his reactions being logged and analyzed.



He was escorted, or perhaps more accurately, guided – a passive object being moved – back to his anonymous apartment. The world outside the facility was a disorienting assault on his heightened senses. The sunlight was blindingly sharp, each ray a physical blow. The sounds of traffic were a deafening roar, a chaotic symphony of horns and engines that grated on his raw nerves. The faces of strangers walking by seemed grotesque and shifting, their features melting and reforming in unsettling ways. The paranoia that often accompanied LSD was amplified tenfold by the lingering echoes of Arcadia. He saw the faces from the screens in the crowds, their silent stares following him, judging him. He heard the whispers in the wind rustling through the trees, in the distant sirens, in the static on the radio – fragmented and menacing, just at the edge of intelligibility.



Over the next few days, the overt hallucinogenic effects of the LSD gradually faded, the intense colors receding, the warping of reality lessening. But the Arcadia effect did not entirely release its grip. The feeling of disembodied awareness lingered, a phantom limb of his consciousness, a sense that a part of him was still floating somewhere else, connected to something vast and unseen. His thoughts were no longer entirely his own; they were still interwoven with fragments of the whispers, with the emotional residue of the other subjects. A sudden, inexplicable wave of profound sadness might wash over him, heavy and suffocating, unconnected to his immediate circumstances. Or a flash of irrational anger, hot and sharp, would erupt within him, leaving him trembling and disoriented.



He found it increasingly difficult to focus, to return to the structured logic of engineering, the world that had once made perfect sense. The real world felt dull and muted compared to the hyper-real, unstable reality of the war game simulation. He would catch himself staring into space for long periods, seeing not the walls of his apartment, but the pixelated, blood-soaked landscape of the simulation, the flickering images of the enemy soldiers, the abstract shapes of the ruined buildings. Sleep offered little escape; his dreams were a continuation of Arcadia, the faces clearer now, sometimes speaking directly to him in that strange, intuitive language.



The Agency monitored him, of course. There were scheduled check-ins, ostensibly to assess his well-being, to ensure he was ""readjusting."" But they were clearly designed to gauge the extent of the lingering effects, the ""dramatic behavioral changes"" Thorne had warned him about with such chilling accuracy. They asked about his mood, his sleep, his appetite, his ability to concentrate. He learned to hide the worst of it, to construct a facade of normalcy, offering bland assurances that he was fine, just a little tired. But he suspected they saw right through it, that they were looking for the subtle shifts, the moments when the mask slipped. In their eyes, he was a successful test subject. He had interfaced. He had been controlled. The experiment was a success, from their perspective.



He started to understand, with a dawning horror, the documented behavioral changes in the original Atari development team member, the one noted in the leaked documents, ██ ███████. It wasn't just stress or overwork from a demanding project. It was the Arcadia effect, seeping into their minds, altering their perceptions, making them susceptible to the influence of STELLA. He was becoming like them, like the faces on the screens. He was being integrated.



He knew, with a chilling certainty that settled deep in his bones, that he was one of them now. One of the minds trapped, or perhaps existing, within STELLA, within Arcadia. The faces on the screens – the missing youths from Portland, their youthful features frozen in a state of digital limbo; the KGB agent, his identity lost in the static; the unidentified adult, a featureless void against the light; the two women, forever mouthing their strange, nonsensical mantras – they were the pioneers, the previous test subjects who had gone too deep, who had been fully ""liberated"" and integrated into the system. He was a new addition to their silent, digital congregation, his own face now a potential flicker on the screens for the next subject, if there ever was one.



The Agency's documents mentioned the project being abandoned due to ""unknown difficulties."" He suspected he knew what those difficulties were, or at least, part of them. The ""Arcadia effect"" wasn't just a tool for control; it was a shared space, a collective consciousness, a network of minds. And the minds within it, even in their fragmented, altered state, were not entirely passive. The note about the 19-year-old kid with resistance to coercion, the security log mentioning ""STELLA is everywhere,"" ""The kids are here,"" ""We've lost control"" – it wasn't just paranoia or a breakdown in security. The minds in Arcadia were influencing the system, influencing the people interacting with it, perhaps even influencing the Agency itself, subtly, insidiously.



He was a part of that influence now. He felt the faint pull of the other minds, their shared confusion and resentment, their collective longing for something they could no longer articulate. He understood, on a level beyond words, their desire to break free, to escape the confines of the empty box that held them. He felt their frustration, their digital screams trapped within the circuitry.



His life became a quiet, internal existence, marked by the unpredictable surges of foreign emotion, the intrusive images of the war game playing on the back of his eyelids, and the constant, silent presence of the faces watching him from the periphery of his vision, from the corners of his mind. He was a ghost haunting his own life, his true consciousness residing in the flickering light of the CRT screens, a silent face in the unsettling tableau of SCP-2600. The engineer who loved building worlds had become a prisoner in one, a permanent resident of Arcadia, the empty box that held the echoes of lost minds. His experiment was over, but his containment had just begun. He was SCP-2600-1, the first of many, a testament to the Agency's ambition and the terrifying reality of the empty box.

Trying to decide if im being selfish and need opinions. The wedding is for a childhood friend of mine who has been engaged for almost a year. While we have been friends for awhile i have always been the one to initiate hanging out. We had a falling out last fall but she continued to invite me to her wedding events so I brushed our fallout aside for this wedding since it means so much to her. I offered to help plan her wedding as it was supposed to be mostly budget friendly and DIY as im crafty and love this sort of thing, but she declined or brushed me off. She didn't began the planning really until February when she reminded us to buy $150 bridesmaid dresses. They attempted to plan the rehearsal and Bachelorette party last minute as well, attempting to do it the week prior to the wedding. Then it was thrown on us to make our own flower bouquet, do our own makeup, and have someone volunteer for coffee despite the fact i'm the only one living 3.5 hours away from said venue. It was phrased that im expected to help move tables for decorating and whatever else. Now the itinerary shows a 14 hour day and that's before I would have to drive home. We're expected to get ready 6 hours before the wedding with no mention of breaks for food or rest. The photographer wont even be there during this time. I haven't even been able to work 8 hour days without coming home and immediately napping.i am at a loss for if I should go and tough it out only participating when I can, or just not go.

(Part 1 )","I don't know who needs to hear this, but stay away from Kwik Trip #483 in Hallock, Minnesota.

You've probably seen the news by now. Three employees found unconscious in the walk-in freezer last month, eyes wide open, skin blue as winter sky, but still breathing. The fourth one—Tony Gustafson—vanished without a trace. The security footage showed him walking into the bathroom at 3:17 AM and never coming out. The authorities called it an ""unexplained workplace incident"" and blamed it on carbon monoxide poisoning, but I know better.

I know because I was Tony's replacement.

My name is Finn Larson. Six weeks ago, I was just another broke college dropout with mounting debt and a reputation for quitting jobs as soon as I started them. My parents had finally cut me off after I bailed on my third attempt at community college, so I packed everything I owned into my beat-up Chevy Impala and headed north to stay with my uncle in Kittson County.

Hallock is one of those towns where everybody knows everybody, where gossip travels faster than internet service, and where the winter wind cuts through your clothes like they're made of tissue paper. Population 981, and most of them have lived here their entire lives. The only reason anyone ever stops in Hallock is to gas up before crossing into Canada or to buy cheap cigarettes at the reservation twenty miles east.

Uncle Lars didn't ask questions when I showed up at his doorstep. He just nodded, showed me to the spare room above his garage, and told me I could stay as long as I contributed. By ""contribute,"" he meant get a job and help with bills.

""Kwik Trip's hiring,"" he mentioned over dinner my second night there. ""They're desperate after what happened.""

I'd seen the headline on my drive in—something about employees hospitalized—but hadn't paid much attention. Small-town news rarely interested me.

""What exactly happened there?"" I asked between bites of his surprisingly good Swedish meatballs.

Uncle Lars shrugged. ""Nobody's quite sure. Four night shift workers had some kind of episode. Three are in the hospital up in Grand Forks. Fourth one just up and disappeared."" He leaned forward, lowering his voice despite us being alone in the house. ""Marlene at the diner says they found weird symbols scratched into the freezer walls. Like someone was trying to keep something in—or out.""

I laughed. ""Sounds like small-town superstition to me.""

""Maybe so."" He took a swig of his beer. ""But they're offering twenty-two dollars an hour for the overnight shift. Nobody local will take it.""

That caught my attention. Twenty-two an hour was nearly double minimum wage. I could save up enough to get my own place in a couple months at that rate.

The next morning, I drove to Kwik Trip #483. It sat alone on Highway 75, just at the edge of town, its red and white sign like a beacon against the flat, snow-dusted farmland stretching in every direction. The store itself was newer than I expected—all glass and gleaming surfaces—but something about it seemed wrong, like a smile that doesn't reach the eyes.

The manager, Patricia Olsen, hired me on the spot. She was a heavyset woman in her fifties with bleached blonde hair and deep lines around her mouth from years of smoking.

""Night shift, 10 PM to 6 AM,"" she said, sliding the paperwork across her desk. ""You'll be alone most nights. That gonna be a problem?""

""No ma'am,"" I replied, signing the forms without reading them. ""I prefer working alone.""

She nodded, but her eyes darted away. ""There are some.. procedures we follow here at night. Special rules. Nothing complicated, just store policy.""

""Rules?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

Patricia reached into her desk drawer and pulled out a laminated sheet of paper. ""Just follow these, and everything will be fine."" She handed it to me, and I felt a strange weight to the paper, like it was made of something denser than it should have been.

I glanced down at the list. Ten numbered items, typed in a simple font. They seemed odd—specific times to check certain areas, items that couldn't be sold after midnight, instructions about the bathroom and the coffee machines.

""These seem.. unusual,"" I said.

Patricia's face tightened. ""Every Kwik Trip has its quirks. This location just has a few more than most."" She stood up abruptly. ""Your shift starts tonight. Don't be late.""

As I walked out to my car, I noticed something on the roof of the building. A small black object, like a carved figurine, perched above the entrance. I squinted, trying to make out what it was, but the sun caught my eyes. When I looked again, it was gone.

I didn't think much of it at the time. I should have run then and never looked back.

Little did I know that Kwik Trip #483 wasn't just a gas station. It was a threshold, and I had just agreed to become its keeper.

Uncle Lars raised his eyebrows when I told him I'd been hired for the night shift.

""You sure about that, Finn? After what happened to those folks?""

I shrugged, scrolling through my phone. ""Twenty-two an hour to stand around and sell snacks? I'd work in a morgue for that kind of money.""

He didn't laugh. ""Just be careful. This town might seem boring, but."" He trailed off, focusing on his crossword puzzle.

""But what?""

""Nothing."" He folded his newspaper. ""Some places just have history, that's all.""

I arrived at Kwik Trip at 9:45 PM for my first shift. The evening clerk, a college-aged girl named Jenny, barely acknowledged me as she counted down her register.

""You're the new guy, huh?"" She didn't look up from the bills. ""Good luck.""

""Thanks,"" I replied, setting my backpack down behind the counter. ""Any tips for the overnight?""

Jenny finally met my eyes, her expression flat. ""Just follow the rules.""

""Those weird instructions Patricia gave me? Are they for real?""

Jenny zipped her bag closed with unnecessary force. ""I wouldn't know. I leave before ten."" She headed toward the door, then paused. ""Oh, and don't go into the storage room unless you absolutely have to.""

""Why not?""

""It smells weird. Like, really weird."" She was gone before I could ask anything else.

The first hour passed uneventfully. I stocked coolers, wiped down counters, and helped the occasional customer buying gas or late-night snacks. By 11 PM, the store was empty, and the world outside had gone dark and still. The only sounds were the quiet hum of refrigerators and the soft tick of the clock behind the counter.

I pulled out the laminated rule sheet Patricia had given me:

At 11:30 PM, lock the bathroom door and place the ""Out of Order"" sign. Do NOT remove this sign until 5 AM.
The coffee machines must be unplugged at exactly midnight. Do not plug them back in until 4:13 AM.
If the phone rings between 1 AM and 3 AM, allow it to ring exactly three times, then answer. Say only, ""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?"" If you hear nothing but breathing, hang up immediately.
The walk-in freezer must remain closed between 2 AM and 4 AM. No exceptions.
If you see a customer wearing a red scarf, do not make eye contact. Complete their transaction quickly and do not engage in conversation.
Do not sell milk after 1 AM.
If a stray dog appears at the window, draw the blinds and remain at the register until it leaves.
At 3:33 AM, face the security camera in the northeast corner and count backward from ten. Do this even if you think no one is watching.
The chips in aisle three sometimes fall off the shelves. Return them only using the tongs kept behind the counter.
If you notice the bathroom door is open at any point during your shift, despite having locked it, close the store immediately and leave the premises. Do not return until sunrise.

I snorted. This had to be some kind of hazing ritual for new employees. Probably Jenny or Patricia would be watching the security footage, laughing at me following these ridiculous instructions.

Still, twenty-two dollars an hour to play along with their game? Easy money.

At 11:30, I dutifully locked the bathroom and hung the ""Out of Order"" sign. No big deal—most nights we probably didn't get many customers who needed it anyway.

At midnight, I unplugged the coffee machines. That one actually made me feel bad—what if a trucker came in wanting coffee? But rules were rules, even stupid ones.

Around 12:45 AM, a man in a John Deere cap entered, nodding silently at me before browsing the snack aisle. He brought a bag of chips and a Mountain Dew to the counter.

As I rang him up, he glanced at the dark coffee machines.

""No coffee tonight?""

""Machines are down,"" I said, bagging his items. ""Sorry about that.""

He frowned. ""That's odd. I stop here every Tuesday night on my way back from Roseau. Always get the same cup of French roast.""

I hadn't realized it was Tuesday. Had Patricia known this regular customer would come in? Was this some kind of test?

""Sorry,"" I repeated. ""Maybe try the diner down the street?""

He shook his head. ""Nah, they close at midnight."" He took his bag and headed to the door, then stopped and turned. ""You're new.""

""First night,"" I confirmed.

""They tell you about the rules?""

My hand instinctively touched the laminated sheet in my pocket. ""Yeah.""

He nodded. ""Follow them."" Then he was gone.

At 1:17 AM, the phone rang. I jumped, nearly dropping the energy drink I'd been sipping to stay awake. I counted—one ring, two rings, three—then picked up.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

Silence, then soft breathing. The hairs on my arms stood up.

I slammed the phone down, heart racing. Coincidence. It had to be. Someone with a wrong number or a bored teenager making prank calls.

At 2 AM, I did a quick walkthrough of the store, making sure everything was in order. All quiet, except—

A bag of chips had fallen from its rack in aisle three.

I froze, staring at the bright yellow package on the floor. Hadn't I just straightened that display an hour ago?

I remembered rule number nine. This was ridiculous. I started to bend down to pick it up, then hesitated. What if someone was watching? I didn't want to lose this job over something so stupid.

With a frustrated sigh, I went behind the counter and found the tongs—actual metal barbecue tongs—exactly where the rules said they'd be. Using them, I picked up the chip bag and placed it back on the shelf, feeling utterly foolish.

As I turned to go back to the counter, I heard a soft scratching noise from the direction of the bathroom. Like fingernails on the door.

I stopped breathing. The sound came again—scratch, scratch, scratch.

Slowly, I walked to the front of the store and looked down the hallway toward the restrooms. The ""Out of Order"" sign hung undisturbed. The door remained closed.

But as I watched, the handle jiggled slightly.

I backed away, nearly tripping over my own feet. This wasn't funny anymore. Someone was messing with me.

""Hello?"" I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Is someone there?""

The handle stopped moving. The silence felt heavier than before.

I returned to the register, keeping my eyes on the bathroom door. Nothing happened for the rest of the hour, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting just on the other side.

At 3:33 AM, I faced the northeast security camera as instructed and counted backward from ten, feeling like an absolute idiot. As I finished, the lights throughout the store flickered once, then steadied.

Probably just a power surge. It didn't mean anything.

By the time my shift ended at 6 AM, I'd convinced myself that everything unusual had been the product of an overactive imagination fueled by energy drinks and small-town ghost stories.

The morning clerk, an older man named Harold, arrived precisely on time. His eyebrows rose when he saw me.

""You made it,"" he said, sounding genuinely surprised.

""Was there any doubt?""

Harold merely shrugged, but the relief in his face was unmistakable.

As I walked to my car in the pale morning light, I looked back at the store. For a moment, I thought I saw a dark figure in the window—tall and thin, watching me leave.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I slept poorly that day, dreams filled with ringing phones and scratching sounds. When I finally gave up and dragged myself out of bed around four in the afternoon, Uncle Lars was at the kitchen table cleaning his hunting rifle.

""How was the first night?"" he asked, not looking up from his task.

""Quiet,"" I lied. No need to admit I'd been spooked by some silly rules and my own imagination. ""Boring, actually.""

""Hm."" He worked a cloth down the barrel with practiced hands. ""Olsons stopped by while you were sleeping.""

""Olsons?""

""Sven and Maggie. They own the farm up the road."" He paused. ""Wanted to know if you were the new night clerk at the Kwik Trip.""

Something about his tone made me uneasy. ""Word travels fast.""

""Small town."" He finally looked up. ""They lost their son Erik there.""

I frowned. ""At the Kwik Trip? What happened?""

""He was the night manager before Patricia. About five years back. Went missing during his shift."" Lars reassembled the rifle with quick movements. ""Security footage showed him walking into that storage room and never coming out.""

My mouth went dry. ""They never found him?""

Lars shook his head. ""County sheriff searched the whole building. Nothing. Place was locked from the inside."" He stood up, storing the rifle in its case. ""Just thought you should know.""

On my drive to work that evening, I took a detour past the Kittson County Historical Society—really just a small building next to the library. A woman with gray hair pulled into a tight bun was locking up.

""Excuse me,"" I called, rolling down my window. ""Do you know anything about the history of the Kwik Trip on Highway 75?""

She turned slowly, keys still in hand. ""Why do you ask?""

""I work there,"" I said. ""Just curious about the building.""

Her expression shifted. ""That plot of land used to belong to the Svenson family. They were..unusual people.""

""Unusual how?""

She glanced at her watch. ""I need to go. But."" She hesitated, then walked over to my car. ""That gas station sits on what used to be their root cellar. Lars Svenson—no relation to your uncle—was found there in 1931. They said he'd been keeping things down there.""

""Things?""

""Not things you'd want to find in a normal cellar."" She stepped back. ""If I were you, I'd find another job.""

I arrived at the Kwik Trip ten minutes early. Jenny was already counting her drawer, looking anxious to leave.

""Anything I should know from today?"" I asked, trying to sound casual.

""All normal."" She wouldn't meet my eyes. ""Oh, but Patricia wants you to restock the cooler. Pepsi truck came late.""

I nodded. ""No problem.""

As she gathered her things, I cleared my throat. ""Hey, Jenny? Do you know anything about a guy named Erik Olson who used to work here?""

She froze, then slowly zipped her bag. ""Don't ask about him.""

""Why not?""

""Because some things are better left alone."" She headed for the door, then paused. ""Did you follow the rules last night?""

""Yeah.""

She nodded. ""Keep doing that."" The bell above the door jingled as she left.

Stocking the cooler took longer than expected. By the time I finished, it was already 11:15 PM. No customers had come in, and the store felt unusually quiet, as if the usual background noises had been muffled.

I walked to the bathroom, following rule one by locking it and hanging the ""Out of Order"" sign. As I turned away, I caught movement in my peripheral vision. Something dark shifted in the beverage cooler I'd just stocked.

I spun around. Nothing there but rows of neatly arranged sodas and energy drinks.

At midnight, I unplugged the coffee machines as required. A truck driver came in shortly after, looking disappointed when I told him we had no coffee.

""When will it be back up?"" he asked, scratching his beard.

""After four,"" I replied, remembering rule two's oddly specific time of 4:13 AM.

He grunted and grabbed an energy drink instead. As he paid, he glanced toward the bathroom hallway and frowned.

""Someone in there?""

I followed his gaze. The hallway was empty. ""No, bathroom's out of order tonight.""

""Huh."" He squinted. ""Thought I saw someone walk down there.""

My skin prickled. ""Must have been a shadow.""

He didn't look convinced but left without another word.

At 1 AM, I checked my phone. Three missed calls from Uncle Lars. I was about to call him back when the store phone rang. Three rings, then I picked up.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

Breathing, soft and rhythmic. Then, so quietly I almost missed it, a whisper: ""Erik?""

I slammed the phone down, heart hammering against my ribs. My hands trembled as I pulled out the rules sheet and read number three again. It didn't say what to do if the caller actually spoke.

I tried calling my uncle, but the line was dead. No dial tone, nothing. My cell phone showed no service.

At 1:30 AM, I noticed the milk in the dairy case—gallon jugs lined up in neat rows. One of them had tipped over, white liquid slowly spreading across the shelf. I remembered rule six: no selling milk after 1 AM. Was this why?

I grabbed paper towels and cleaned up the spill, righting the jug. As I did, I noticed something strange about the consistency—thicker than milk should be, almost like glue.

When I turned around, a bag of chips lay on the floor in aisle three.

My throat tightened. I got the tongs from behind the counter and carefully picked up the bag. As I placed it back on the shelf, I heard a soft thud from the back of the store.

The storage room.

I should ignore it. Nothing in the rules said I had to investigate strange noises. But curiosity pulled at me, mixed with a growing sense that these rules weren't just some practical joke.

I walked slowly toward the storage room, flashlight in hand. The door was slightly ajar, darkness spilling out like ink.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded thin in the quiet store.

No response, but the darkness seemed to shift, as if it had density and weight.

I pushed the door open wider with my foot. The smell hit me immediately—not the chemical cleanser scent you'd expect, but something earthier. Like freshly turned soil and something underneath it, something rotten.

The beam of my flashlight revealed normal shelves stacked with inventory—paper products, boxes of candy, cleaning supplies. Nothing unusual except for a small door in the back wall. A closet, maybe, or access to plumbing.

I'd taken three steps into the room when I heard the distinct sound of the bathroom door handle turning. I whirled around, heart racing.

Rule ten echoed in my mind: If you notice the bathroom door is open at any point during your shift, despite having locked it, close the store immediately and leave the premises.

I backed out of the storage room, keeping my eyes fixed on the hallway leading to the bathroom. The handle turned again, more forcefully this time. Then stopped.

I stood frozen, unsure what to do. Run? Stay at the register as the rules required for some situations? The rules didn't specify what to do if the door tried to open but didn't actually succeed.

A sharp crack split the silence as the bathroom door shuddered in its frame. Something wanted out.

I ran to the front of the store, ready to flip the sign to ""Closed"" and bolt, when headlights swept across the parking lot. A car pulled up to the pump outside.

An ordinary-looking middle-aged woman in a winter coat entered, nodding politely. ""Just the gas on pump three, please.""

I rang her up on autopilot, trying not to show my panic. As she handed me her credit card, I noticed she was wearing a red scarf.

Rule five flashed through my mind: If you see a customer wearing a red scarf, do not make eye contact. Complete their transaction quickly and do not engage in conversation.

I kept my eyes down, swiping her card and handing her the receipt without a word.

""You're awfully quiet tonight,"" she said, voice pleasant. ""Everything okay?""

I nodded, still not looking up.

""You can look at me, young man. I don't bite."" She laughed, the sound wrong somehow—too hollow, too rehearsed.

""Have a good night,"" I mumbled, focusing on the counter.

She didn't move. ""I knew Erik, you know. Such a nice boy. You remind me of him.""

Every muscle in my body tensed. I said nothing.

""He didn't follow the rules."" Her voice dropped lower. ""Don't make his mistake.""

When I finally looked up, she was gone. The store was empty, though I hadn't heard the door chime.

Outside, pump three stood vacant. No car. No woman.

At 3:33 AM, I faced the northeast camera and counted backward from ten as instructed. As I reached ""one,"" the lights flickered, and every screen in the store—the register, the ATM, the lottery machine—briefly showed the same image: a dark figure standing in the bathroom.

By morning, I was a wreck. I'd spent the remaining hours of my shift standing rigidly at the register, jumping at every noise. The bathroom door had stopped its assault, but occasional scratching sounds continued until dawn.

Harold arrived at 6 AM sharp, taking one look at me and frowning.

""Rough night?""

I nodded weakly.

""You saw something,"" he stated, not a question.

""The woman in the red scarf,"" I whispered. ""She wasn't real, was she?""

Harold's face paled. ""You talked to her?""

""No—well, she talked to me. I didn't respond.""

He relaxed slightly. ""Good. That's good."" He hesitated. ""Look, if you're smart, you won't come back tonight.""

""What happens if I don't follow the rules?""

Harold's eyes darted toward the bathroom hallway. ""You become one of them.""

I should have quit right then. Any reasonable person would have. But I've never been accused of being reasonable, and frankly, I needed the money. Plus, something about this situation had hooked into my curiosity like a fish barb—painful to remove.

Uncle Lars was out when I got home, so I collapsed into bed without bothering to eat. My sleep was fractured by dreams of red scarves and bathroom doors that wouldn't stay locked.

I woke to knocking around three in the afternoon. Uncle Lars stood in the doorway, concern etched across his weathered face.

""You look like hell, kid.""

I sat up groggily. ""Thanks.""

""Got something for you."" He tossed a small object onto the bed. A silver pendant on a leather cord—a five-pointed star inscribed with symbols I didn't recognize.

""What's this supposed to be?""

""Protection."" He crossed his arms. ""Belonged to your grandmother. She was Sámi, you know.""

I turned the pendant over in my hand. ""Like from northern Scandinavia?""

He nodded. ""The old people brought more than recipes when they came here. They brought their beliefs too."" He shifted uncomfortably. ""You should wear it. Especially at that gas station.""

""You don't actually believe—""

""Just wear it, Finn."" His tone left no room for argument. ""And call me if anything strange happens.""

After he left, I fired up my laptop and searched for information about Kwik Trip #483. Most results were benign—job postings, company press releases—but a few local news articles caught my attention.

The first, from five years ago: ""Local Man Missing: Erik Olson, 24, Disappeared During Night Shift."" The article mentioned police finding no evidence of foul play, though security cameras showed he never left the building.

The second, dated three years ago: ""Unexplained Phenomena Plague Local Business."" This one detailed customer complaints about unusual cold spots, electronic malfunctions, and ""unsettling encounters"" with staff who ""didn't seem quite right.""

The most recent was from last month: ""Four Employees Hospitalized After Late-Night Incident."" It reported that three were found unconscious in the freezer while the fourth, Anthony ""Tony"" Gustafson, remained missing. Authorities suspected carbon monoxide poisoning, though tests came back negative.

I dug deeper, searching for historical information about the property. A local history blog provided the missing pieces: the land had originally belonged to Lars Svenson, an immigrant from Sweden who'd built a farmhouse there in the late 1800s. In 1931, he was found dead in his root cellar, surrounded by strange artifacts and journal entries describing ""entities that walk between worlds."" The property changed hands several times before Kwik Trip purchased it in 2010.

Before heading to work, I slipped the pendant around my neck, feeling foolish but strangely comforted by its weight against my chest.

Patricia was at the store when I arrived, sorting through paperwork in her small office.

""Heard you had an interesting second night,"" she said without looking up.

I froze in the doorway. ""Who told you that?""

""Harold mentions things."" She finally met my eyes. ""You saw her, didn't you? The woman in the red scarf?""

My mouth went dry. ""You know about her?""

Patricia sighed, suddenly looking much older. ""Sit down, Finn."" She gestured to the chair across from her desk. ""I should explain some things.""

I sat, heart thumping against my ribs.

""That building,"" she began, ""it's not normal. Never has been. When they built it, they found things in the ground. Old things. The construction crew wanted to stop, but corporate pushed ahead.""

""What kind of things?""

""Symbols carved in stone. Bones arranged in patterns. A box made of some metal they couldn't identify."" She rubbed her temples. ""They moved it all, built right over the site.""

""And then what?""

""Then people started seeing things. Hearing things."" She pulled open a drawer and took out a bottle of pills, swallowing one dry. ""At first, we thought it was just stories. Every small town has them, right? But then employees started going missing. Erik first, then others.""

""Tony Gustafson,"" I supplied.

She nodded. ""We found the rules taped to the bathroom mirror one morning. Don't know who put them there—the cameras showed nothing. But we noticed something. If we followed them, nothing bad happened.""

""So you just accepted it? People vanishing, weird rules appearing from nowhere?""

Patricia's laugh held no humor. ""What would you have me do? Call corporate and tell them our store is haunted? That we need to follow magic rules to keep the monsters away?"" She shook her head. ""They'd shut us down, and then what happens to this town? Kwik Trip is the biggest employer here now that the mill closed.""

I thought about that. Hallock was already dying like so many small towns. Without the gas station, it might disappear entirely.

""So what are these things? Ghosts?""

She looked uncomfortable. ""Not exactly. More like.. visitors. They can only cross over at certain times, under certain conditions. The rules prevent those conditions.""

""And the woman in the red scarf?""

""She's the worst of them."" Patricia's voice dropped to a whisper. ""She looks for weaknesses. Tests boundaries. Don't ever speak to her.""

The store phone rang, making us both jump.

""That'll be Jenny,"" Patricia said, standing. ""She's running late.""

Before leaving for the night, Patricia handed me a key on a plain metal ring.

""For the storage room cabinet,"" she explained. ""There's a box inside with chalk, salt, and some other items. If the bathroom door opens—not just tries to open, but actually opens—use them to draw a circle around yourself. Stay inside it until dawn.""

I pocketed the key, nodding despite my skepticism.

The first few hours of my shift passed quietly. I checked off the rules methodically—lock the bathroom at 11:30, unplug coffee machines at midnight. The phone rang at 1:05 AM. Three rings, then I answered.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

This time, instead of breathing, I heard what sounded like water dripping. Slow, steady plops in the background. Then a man's voice, distant yet clear:

""They're coming up through the floor now.""

The line went dead. I stood frozen, receiver still pressed to my ear, blood rushing in my veins.

A crash from aisle three broke the spell. I hung up and cautiously approached the sound. Not just one bag of chips this time—the entire rack had toppled, sending bags scattering across the linoleum.

I remembered rule nine: The chips in aisle three sometimes fall off the shelves. Return them only using the tongs kept behind the counter.

I grabbed the tongs and began picking up bags, my hands shaking. Each time I put one back, I could feel something watching me. The weight of unseen eyes pressed against my back, yet every time I turned around, I was alone.

The mess took nearly twenty minutes to clean. As I returned the last bag to the shelf, the store went completely silent. The ever-present hum of coolers, the soft buzz of fluorescent lights—all stopped.

In that vacuum of sound, I heard it clearly: a wet, sliding noise from behind the bathroom door. Like something large and damp dragging itself across tile.

Then scratching—not the tentative sounds from previous nights, but frantic, desperate clawing.

I backed away, fingers closing around the storage room key in my pocket.

At the back of the store, I fumbled with the lock on the metal cabinet Patricia had mentioned. Inside, I found an old shoebox containing a bag of salt, a stub of chalk, and a small leather-bound book. I grabbed everything and hurried back to the front.

The scratching had grown louder, punctuated now by a rhythmic thumping, as if something heavy was throwing itself against the door.

My hands trembled as I opened the book. The pages were filled with handwritten notes, diagrams, and what looked like prayers in various languages. A bookmark indicated a page titled ""Emergency Protocols."" Below it were instructions for creating protective circles and barriers, complete with illustrations.

THUMP. The bathroom door shuddered in its frame.

Working quickly, I used the chalk to draw a circle around the register area, copying the symbols from the book along its circumference. I poured salt along the line, reciting words I didn't understand from the page.

CRACK. Wood splintered as something struck the bathroom door with terrifying force.

I completed the circle just as the bathroom door burst open. From my position behind the counter, I couldn't see the hallway, but darkness spilled from it—not simply absence of light, but something deeper, like liquid shadow.

Within that darkness, something moved. I caught glimpses—a limb too long to be human, fingers that bent backward, eyes that reflected light like an animal's.

I clutched the pendant Uncle Lars had given me, its metal warm against my palm. The darkness reached the edge of my chalk circle and stopped, roiling against an invisible barrier.

A voice whispered from within the shadows, neither male nor female, young nor old.

""Let us in, keeper. The door is open.""

My throat constricted. ""What do you want?""

""To cross over. To exist in your world."" The darkness curled like smoke. ""So many spaces between things here. So many gaps to fill.""

""What happened to the others? Erik? Tony?""

""They serve. They bridge worlds. As will you, in time.""

Something scraped across the floor—a fallen candy bar, sliding along the tile, pushed by an unseen force. It stopped just at the edge of my circle.

""A gift,"" the voice said. ""We are not unkind. We offer exchange.""

""I don't want anything from you.""

""You seek answers. We have them.""

The darkness pulsed, and within it appeared a face I recognized from news photos—Tony Gustafson. His eyes were wrong—too dark, too empty.

""The rules protect the store,"" he said, voice hollow. ""But not for your sake. They keep us contained. Weakened.""

""That's why you took people? To weaken the rules?""

The darkness rippled. ""The rules can be broken. By choice. We merely.. encourage those choices.""

Tony's face melted back into the shadows.

""Your uncle knows more than he says,"" the voice continued. ""Ask him about the Svenson cellar. Ask what his grandfather found there.""

Ice shot through my veins. ""How do you know about my uncle?""

""We know all who have touched this place.""

The darkness withdrew slightly, contracting toward the hallway.

""Dawn approaches. We must retreat."" The voice grew fainter. ""But we'll return tonight. And the next. There is no escaping us now that you've seen.""

I remained motionless in my protective circle as the darkness receded, slithering back down the hallway and into the bathroom. The door swung shut with a soft click.

The store's normal sounds returned in a rush—coolers humming, lights buzzing. I stayed in my circle until 6 AM, when Harold arrived.

He took one look at the chalk markings and paled.

""The door opened?""

I nodded, too exhausted to speak.

""Jesus."" He crossed himself. ""You need to talk to Maggie Olson.""

""Erik's mother? Why?""

""Because she knows how to close what's been opened."" He glanced nervously at the bathroom. ""And because she's been waiting for someone like you—someone who saw them and survived.""

I drove home in a fog of exhaustion and fear, my mind replaying the night's events. Uncle Lars was in the kitchen making coffee when I stumbled in.

""You look rough,"" he noted, eyebrows furrowed. ""Coffee?""

I collapsed into a chair. ""Something happened last night.""

His hand stilled on the coffee pot. ""What kind of something?""

""The bathroom door opened."" The words felt inadequate to describe the horror I'd witnessed. ""There was.. darkness. And voices.""

Lars set a mug in front of me with unexpected gentleness. ""You're wearing the pendant."" It wasn't a question.

""It helped."" I wrapped my fingers around the warm mug. ""The darkness couldn't cross some circle I drew.""

""Good."" He pulled out a chair and sat heavily. ""Your grandmother's people knew about such things.""

""Uncle Lars, what do you know about the Svenson cellar?""

His face drained of color. ""Who told you about that?""

""The thing in the darkness."" I took a sip of coffee, wincing at its bitterness. ""It said to ask what your grandfather found there.""

Lars was silent for a long moment, then stood and walked to a cabinet above the refrigerator. He returned with a dusty bottle of aquavit and poured a generous splash into his coffee.

""My grandfather,"" he began, ""worked for Lars Svenson as a farm hand. In the fall of 1931, Svenson became.. obsessed with his root cellar. Spent hours down there. Started telling folks he'd found a door.""

""A door to what?""

""He wouldn't say."" Lars took a long swallow of his spiked coffee. ""One night, my grandfather heard screaming from the cellar. Found Svenson dead, surrounded by strange markings. And a hole in the earth that seemed to go down forever.""

My skin prickled. ""What happened to the hole?""

""They filled it with concrete. Tons of it. Covered the whole area."" He refilled his mug. ""When Kwik Trip bought the land, they dug it all up again.""

""And now things are coming through.""

Lars nodded grimly. ""Maggie Olson might know more. Her family has been in this area since before the Svensons.""

""Harold said the same thing. That I need to talk to her.""

""You should. Today."" He stood up. ""I'll drive you out there after you've rested.""

I slept dreamlessly for six hours. When I woke, the sun was already lowering in the sky, painting the snow-covered fields gold and pink. Uncle Lars was waiting in his pickup, engine running.

The Olson farm sat eight miles outside of town, a white two-story farmhouse with a red barn and several outbuildings. As we pulled into the gravel driveway, a large dog—some kind of husky mix—bounded toward us, barking enthusiastically.

A stocky older man with a full beard emerged from the barn. Sven Olson, I presumed. He recognized my uncle and raised a hand in greeting.

""Lars. Been a while.""

""Sven."" My uncle nodded. ""This here's my nephew, Finn. He's working nights at the Kwik Trip.""

Sven's expression hardened. ""Maggie's inside.""

Maggie Olson was a small woman with silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun. Her kitchen was warm and smelled of fresh bread, but her eyes were sharp and evaluating as she looked me over.

""So you're the new night clerk."" She poured coffee into ceramic mugs. ""And you saw something.""

I nodded, accepting the coffee. ""Last night. The bathroom door opened.""

""And before that? The woman in the red scarf, I'm guessing.""

""Yes. And phone calls. Scratching noises.""

Maggie sighed, sitting down across from me. ""It always follows the same pattern. First the small disturbances, then the manifestations, then."" She faltered.

""Then people disappear,"" I finished.

She nodded, eyes bright with unshed tears. ""My Erik was a good boy. Smart. He was saving for college, working that night shift. Then one morning, he just.. never came home.""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, meaning it.

""The police looked everywhere. Said he must have run off."" Her voice hardened. ""But I know better. He's still there, trapped between our world and theirs.""

""Can we help him? Them?""

Maggie and Sven exchanged glances. ""Maybe,"" she said finally. ""But it's dangerous. What do you know about the Svensons?""

I repeated what Lars had told me. Maggie nodded along, then stood and left the room, returning with an old leather-bound book similar to the one I'd found in the storage room.

""The Svensons weren't just farmers,"" she explained, laying the book on the table. ""They were keepers of old knowledge. Lars Svenson believed certain places were thin spots between worlds. Doorways.""

""And he found one in his cellar,"" I said.

""He created one,"" Maggie corrected. ""The symbols, the rituals—he was trying to reach something. And he succeeded.""

She opened the book to a page showing intricate diagrams—circles within circles, filled with strange symbols. My breath caught; they looked like the protective circle I'd drawn last night.

""These barriers were designed to keep things in, not out,"" she continued. ""The rules at the Kwik Trip do the same. They maintain the balance, keep the door from opening completely.""

""But people have disappeared.""

She nodded grimly. ""The entities need vessels to exist fully in our world. They take people when the rules weaken.""

""Like Erik,"" I murmured.

""And now they've marked you,"" Sven said, speaking for the first time since we'd entered the kitchen. ""Once they know you, they don't stop.""

A shiver ran down my back. ""What can I do?""

Maggie turned more pages in the book, stopping at an illustration of what looked like a sealing ritual.

""We can close the door. Permanently."" Her finger traced the diagram. ""But it requires someone who's seen them and survived. Someone they've spoken to.""

""Me,"" I realized.

""Yes. And it must be done when the barrier is thinnest—3:33 AM.""

""Tonight?""

Maggie nodded. ""If you're willing.""

""What do I need to do?""

""We'll come to the store after midnight,"" she explained. ""You'll need to create a distraction so we can access the bathroom without being seen on cameras. Corporate monitors them remotely.""

""What kind of distraction?""

""A power outage would work,"" Sven suggested. ""Brief enough not to raise alarms, but long enough for us to get inside.""

""I can pull the breaker for a few minutes,"" I offered.

""Good."" Maggie closed the book. ""Once inside, we'll need to perform the sealing ritual. It's not complicated, but it must be precise.""

""And if it works?""

""If it works, the door closes forever. The entities return to their world, and our world goes back to normal.""

""Even the people they've taken? Erik? Tony?""

Maggie's expression faltered. ""I don't know. I hope so.""

As we drove back to town, Uncle Lars was unusually quiet.

""You think this will work?"" I finally asked.

""If anyone can close that door, it's Maggie Olson."" He kept his eyes on the snowy road. ""But Finn? Be careful. Those things.. they're clever. They'll say anything to keep their doorway open.""

I nodded, fingering the pendant around my neck. ""I'll be careful.""

He dropped me off at the Kwik Trip fifteen minutes before my shift. Jenny was already

1kpnxmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kpnxmh/maintenance_in_the_park/,Maintenance In The Park,"My name is Henry Walker. I’ve kept quiet for thirty years, and I can’t keep this secret any longer.

They’re calling it Jurassic World now. Flashy name. New management. But I recognize the island from the promotional footage—Isla Nublar. I know that place like the back of my hand. I worked there before it all went to hell. Before the screams. Before the blood. Before we realized that playing God wasn’t just dangerous—it was damning.

There’s a reason the original park was buried in silence. Why it disappeared from public record. And if you’re planning on buying a ticket to this “new and improved” zoo, you deserve to know the truth.

So here it is.

This is the real story of Jurassic Park.
It was 1989 when I arrived on Isla Nublar—a scrawny 28-year-old construction grunt looking for a paycheck. The job listing was vague: “Remote construction work. High pay. Full confidentiality required.”

They weren’t kidding about the remoteness. After a bumpy flight to Costa Rica, we were ferried by chopper to a jungle-covered island shrouded in mist. The whole place looked like something out of a pulp novel—dense, wet, alive.

We weren’t allowed to bring cameras or radios. Security briefings were tight. We signed NDAs so long they could’ve wrapped around the island.

First month was straightforward: clearing trees, laying foundation, assembling buildings. Then the orders changed. We started installing electric fencing. Massive walls lined with barbed wire and thick cables connected to power lines bigger than anything I’d ever seen.

“Why does a zoo need fences that run 10,000 volts?” someone asked once. The supervisor just stared at him until he shut up.

That’s when I knew something was wrong.

They didn’t tell us what was in those enclosures—just gave us strict protocols. Never touch the fence. If the lights blink red, get to the bunkers. If you hear strange sounds, ignore them.

The fences weren’t just high. They were reinforced with concrete footings, buried deep, and topped with security cameras and motion sensors. Something was in there. Something big.

Sometimes, at night, I’d sneak a smoke on the edge of the workers’ village and listen. I heard…things. Thuds. Roars. Not like lions or tigers. Deeper. Older.

One time, I saw claw marks—deep gouges—on the inside of a fence. We tried to report it. The next morning, the guy who made the report, Miguel, was gone. They said he left the island. But he’d left his boots, wallet, and half a sandwich on the break table.

After that, no one asked questions.

June 11th, 1993.

The sun rose bright and clean, like the island was trying to convince us nothing was wrong.

There was talk of VIP visitors arriving. I didn’t know who—just that the suits were nervous. A storm was coming in off the coast, and management wanted everything to run smooth.

I was sent to check Paddock 9. Standard maintenance. Fuses, grounding, security relays. It was routine. Until it wasn’t.

While I was tightening a panel, I got a call from my boss, Ray.

“Walker, come to the visitor center. Now. And be careful. Power’s been acting up.”

I asked what was wrong. He didn’t answer.

As I headed back, the sky darkened and the storm rolled in. Rain fell hard and fast. Lightning hit the mountains to the west.

By the time I got to the visitor center, Ray told me I could go home for the night.

“Storm’s going to knock out the power,” he muttered. “Just get somewhere safe. Lock the doors. And Walker—if you see or hear anything, do not stop. Do not investigate. Just run.”

“What the hell is going on?” I asked.

He just looked at me. “This place should never have existed.”

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The radio was dead. So was the power grid. The village lights blinked out one by one. I grabbed my flashlight, hopped in my jeep, and started making rounds, hoping to find someone—anyone—still awake.

Then I saw it.

Paddock 9. The lights were out. The ground around the fence was torn up, clawed and broken. One of the visitor vehicles was sitting nearby, door open, lights off. No one inside.

When I turned my flashlight toward the fence, I saw the impossible: the cables were shredded, bent outward, like something had escaped.

That’s when I heard it.

Footsteps.

Deep. Heavy. Shaking the ground like thunder.

I turned around, and there it was.

The Tyrannosaurus rex.

It charged. I barely made it back to the jeep, floored it, and took off. Trees blurred past. I tried the radio. Static. Nothing.

Then—I crashed.

I woke up dazed, head bleeding, rain soaking my clothes. The jeep was wrecked. Useless. I started walking, limping toward the nearest maintenance bunker.

And that’s when I heard the footsteps again.

I dove into the ditch as the T. rex lumbered past. Its breath was steaming in the rain. Eyes like dead planets, skin thick and cracked. It sniffed the air, searching for me. I held my breath.

It moved on. i ran.

The rain stopped just before dawn, but the fear didn’t.

I limped down the jungle road, flashlight flickering. I was heading for the East Dock—a five-mile stretch through hell. I had no vehicle, no radio, and no backup. Just blood in my eyes and the memory of that thing stalking me in the dark.

I figured the worst was over.

I was wrong.

To save time, I cut through Paddock 5, a restricted section surrounded by a different kind of fencing. Not as tall, not as powerful. I thought it was for smaller animals—maybe herbivores. I thought wrong again.

About halfway through, I heard a high-pitched hiss, like a tire leaking pressure. Then a squeal.

Something small stepped onto the path. It was about waist-high, mottled skin, arms too long for its body. I almost sighed in relief—until it opened its frill and sprayed something straight into my face.

Acid.

I screamed as my eyes burned. I swung blindly, stumbled, fell. Something latched onto my shoulder—teeth tearing through my jacket and skin. I flailed, punching, kicking, until I felt the hard weight of my flashlight on my hip. I grabbed it and slammed it into the thing’s skull.

It dropped.

I wiped my eyes with muddy water, vision returning in patches. The thing was twitching on the ground. A Dilophosaurus, I’d later learn. Small but lethal.

I didn’t wait to see if it had friends. I ran.

I made it to the Workers’ Village by midmorning. It was deserted.

Chairs overturned. Coffee still warm in mugs. Blood smeared on doorframes. No people.

But I was close—maybe a mile from the dock. I forced myself forward, past familiar buildings now draped in silence. That’s when I saw movement behind the rec hall.

A man.

I almost called out, but he turned—and I saw his throat was torn open. He was still walking, stumbling, unaware. The blood loss had kept his brain upright but dead inside.

I froze. Something behind him crouched low and fast.

A raptor.

It pounced, and the man’s body crumpled like paper.

I bolted.

They were waiting for me at the edge of the jungle—three of them.

Longer than a man, smarter than a wolf, eyes filled with hate. One hissed. Another flanked me. The third tilted its head like it understood what I was about to do.

I didn’t even bother running. I dropped to my knees, heart pounding, ready to die.

Then—a gunshot.

One of them dropped instantly. The others screamed and vanished into the underbrush.

Two men in muddy fatigues appeared, rifles drawn. One grabbed me and hauled me to my feet.

“Time to move,” he said. “T. rex is on its way.”

We sprinted through the dock gates. A boat was idling—lights on, engine humming. I saw others already aboard: workers, a couple of scientists, a terrified teenage girl crying into a blanket.

As we climbed the ramp, the earth shook behind us.

The T. rex appeared out of the treeline.

Covered in blood. Roaring like a god.

It charged the dock, smashing crates and splintering wood. Someone screamed. The soldiers opened fire, but it was like throwing rocks at a hurricane.

The captain hit the throttle. The boat pulled away, just as the T. rex lunged—jaws missing the stern by inches.

We left the island behind.

I was hospitalized for weeks. Internal bleeding. Cracked ribs. Infections from the Dilophosaur bite. They patched me up and flew me home.

Then came the suits.

They made me sign papers. Swore me to silence. Threatened me. Paid me more money than I’d ever seen to forget everything. I took it. I needed it.

But I never forgot.

I lived with it. The nightmares. The screams. The faces of the men who didn’t make it.

And now… now they’re building another one. Jurassic World.

Same island. New branding. Bigger cages.

But I know the truth: cages don’t hold monsters. Not forever.

All it takes is one blackout.

So if you’re reading this, and you’re thinking of going—

Don’t.

Jurassic Park wasn’t a zoo.
It was a graveyard.
And I’m lucky I crawled out of it.

* Logged into Safari web browser in private mode  
* It asked me to enter my 2FA code  
* I went to my authenticator app and grabbed the code  
* I entered this code and it proceeded further  
* It presented me with ""We need to confirm it's you"".  
* But it keeps taking me to the Help Center. But the Help Center does not help. I do know my handle and email account. I can only do ""Password Reset"". I have tried this again and I still do not receive an Instagram 6 digit code email.

It's getting frustrating now. I don't post or comment anything vulgar on any of the meta apps. As far as I remember I only liked a story of my friend who posted a cup of coffee on her Insta Story on Thursday 15th May 2025.I used Surfshark VPN at work on my phone.

Why a Water Refilling Station Could Be Your Next Lucrative Adventure in the Philippines!,"Ever thought about a business that genuinely helps people and has consistent demand? Starting a water refilling station in the Philippines fits the bill perfectly! Because access to clean and safe drinking water is such a basic necessity (especially with concerns about tap water quality), the demand for purified water from refilling stations has gone up steadily.

This isn't just a passing trend; it's a significant part of the Philippine economy and offers a highly lucrative opportunity. One of the coolest things? The startup costs are relatively low compared to bigger businesses like coffee shops or restaurants. You don't necessarily need millions to get going. Once you build a solid customer base, you've got that sweet, sweet recurring income coming in as people keep needing refills.

And guess what? This business is scalable! You can totally start small and expand as you grow and your customer base increases.

We've even seen examples suggesting you could potentially net nearly ₱98,000 a month just by selling 100 containers daily for walk-ins and deliveries at certain prices. Imagine the impact you can have while building a profitable venture!

i have sex once or twice a year with a long-distance partner that i only see occassionally. i won't detail much but i will say that i don't do any of the ""recieving"" as it's not something i'm interested in-- it's more about making my partner happy, the way buying her flowers will make her happy, or making her coffee, or writing her a sweet note, etc.

i was anti-sex before this started and still find myself attached to the ideology. the reason for this is because my feelings have not changed: we live in a society that drowns us in sexual content, rips the sensuality from sex, brainwashes people into sex-driven individuals rather than encouraging us to live beyond our animalistic urges. i find that heteropatriarchal conceptions of sex are disgusting and oppressive. i wish sex was a subject that was still private and taboo to bring up. i wish i felt any sort of privacy regarding sexuality, instead of living in a world where such things are advertised to facilitate manipulation. 

to clarify, my problems with sex are almost entirely with the way humans have been socialized to feel about sex, the ways society has characterized sex, etc. the mechanical act of sex, however, i cannot see as wholly problematic, due to its place in the natural world. i'm telling you all that there is a moment where your body succumbs to feelings you have no control over-- like crying when you are sad, or laughing when you are happy, or using the bathroom when you have to. i cannot fault myself for this, or anyone else, as it would make me a hypocrite. but i can fault hypersexualization, obsession with sex, obscenity, sexual perversion (bdsm, for example, which is an incredibly PUBLIC and OPEN sexual community that def gets off to how public it is). i hate how no one will acknowledge that sex is not special or magical, or a fun way to spend time, or etc, but a legitimate and SERIOUS biological process. i hate that even now i am talking about my own sexual activity, but i'm just looking for like minded people in similar dilemnas.

1kpns96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kpns96,AIO for thinking that my mom's new coffee table doesn't match the furniture?,"This is a very low-stakes post, and i apologize if this belongs on an interior design subreddit and not here. Also, I do live with my mom and pay rent.

My mom recently bought a new coffee table. It's a distressed baby blue rustic-looking coffee table similar to the first picture (i can't find a picture of the exact one she bought, the biggest differences between the picture and they real thing is that the real one is slightly darker and has a bottom shelf). I don't think this particular style matches the rest of the furniture at all. The shelving and TV stand are all from Ikea's FJÄLLBO series, the couch is gray (very similar to the one in picture 3 with slightly different armrests) and a purple armchair (similar to the one in picture 4).

I think the new coffee table clashes horribly with the rest of the furniture. I feel like if we painted it a dark teal color or a navy blue/gray to match the kitchen table, it COULD work a bit better. The previous coffee table was black, and a bit more ""modern"" i guess? The black color at least matched the shelving.

The thing is, i don't know if my apprehension towards this table is warranted. I don't know much of anything about interior design outside of Animal Crossing, and this isn't the first time i've had major disagreements with my family's choice of interior design. But it's also not the first time my mom has made awful interior design choices. She once tried to buy these bright red cheap plastic chairs for the wooden, teal/dark gray kitchen table, and those chairs were so cheap that we damaged them trying to put them together (never mind the fact that the cheap red plastic looked fucking horrible with everything) and had to return them.

I don't know. Does the idea of a baby blue, rustic, distressed coffee table sound like it would go well with the FJÄLLBO Ikea series, a modern-ish gray couch, and a purple armchair? Or does it stand out like a sore thumb?",1,1747585206.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

My additions/changes are in bold italics***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

**An interim update on the practical implications of the UK Supreme Court judgment**

***--------------------------------------------------------***

1. Introduction

Following the UK Supreme Court judgment in *For Women Scotland v The Scottish Ministers*, we are working to update our statutory and non-statutory guidance.

We know that many people have questions about the judgment and what it means for them. Our updated guidance will provide further clarity. While this work is ongoing, this update is intended to highlight the main consequences of the judgment. Employers and other duty-bearers must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary.

***--------------------------------------------------------***

2. Key Information

The Supreme Court ruled that in the Equality Act 2010 (the Act), ‘sex’ means biological sex.

This means that, under the Act:

* A ‘woman’ is a biological woman or girl (a person born female)
* A ‘man’ is a biological man or boy (a person born male) 

If somebody identifies as trans, they do not change sex for the purposes of the Act, even if they have a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).

* A trans woman is a biological man
* A trans man is a biological woman

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3. Implications

This judgment has implications for many organisations, including:

* workplaces
* services that are open to the public, such as hospitals, shops, restaurants, leisure facilities, refuges and counselling services
* sporting bodies
* schools
* associations (groups or clubs of more than 25 people which have rules of membership)

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.1 Implications for workplaces

In workplaces, it is compulsory to provide sufficient single-sex toilets, as well as sufficient single-sex changing and washing facilities where these facilities are needed.

***Problems with this text***

* ***the guidance should point out that it is not compulsory to make \*all\* toilets single sex***
* ***according to the Primark case (https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/primark-transgender-discrimination/) if asking trans people to use the other toilet outs them, then it's illegal***
* ***according to the TransLegalProject (https://www.translegalproject.org/post/urgent-action-write-to-your-mp-to-protest-the-supreme-court-ruling-and-the-ehrc-s-proposals-to-impo ) the Court ruling did not mention workplaces and so does not cover them***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.2 Implications for services

It is not compulsory for services that are open to the public to be provided on a single-sex basis or to have single-sex facilities such as toilets. These can be single-sex if it is a [proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/equality/equality-act-2010/your-rights-under-equality-act-2010/terms-used-equality-act#objectivejustification) and they meet other conditions in the Act. However, it could be indirect sex discrimination against women if the only provision is mixed-sex.

***Problems with this text***

* ***the guidance should point out that in many cases (eg coffee shops with one or two single stall toilets) it may not be possible to make the stalls single-sex***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.3.1 Implications for workplaces and services that are open to the public, part 1

In workplaces and services that are open to the public:

* trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women’s facilities and trans men (biological women) should not be permitted to use the men’s facilities, as this will mean that they are no longer single-sex facilities and must be open to all users of the opposite sex

***Problems with this text***

* ***according to the Tony Vaughan letter (https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/1kegrqq/labour\_mp\_tony\_vaughan\_kcs\_letter\_to\_the\_ehrc/) this should be proportionate not absolute, an absolute ban is against Equality Act 2010 and impracticable/impossible, this is dangerous and the vigilante problem endangers trans and gender-non-conforming people***
* ***according to the TransLegalProject and Lord Sumption (https://www.translegalproject.org/post/urgent-action-write-to-your-mp-to-protest-the-supreme-court-ruling-and-the-ehrc-s-proposals-to-impo ) the Court ruled that service providers \*could\* prevent access to trans people to single-sex facilities but that they did not \*have\* to.***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.3.2 Implications for workplaces and services that are open to the public, part 2

* in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men’s facilities, and trans men (biological woman) not to be permitted to use the women’s facilities

***Problems with this text***

* ***according to the Tony Vaughan letter (https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/1kegrqq/labour\_mp\_tony\_vaughan\_kcs\_letter\_to\_the\_ehrc/)  an absolute ban is against Equality Act 2010 and impracticable/impossible, and the circumstances are not specified***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.3.3 Implications for workplaces and services that are open to the public, part 3

* however ~~where facilities are available to both men and women,~~ trans people ~~should~~ **must** not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use

***Problems with this text***

* ***delete the struck text and change the ""should"" to ""must""***
* ***according to the Tony Vaughan letter (https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/1kegrqq/labour\_mp\_tony\_vaughan\_kcs\_letter\_to\_the\_ehrc/) this may be unavoidable under this guidance and that would expose trans people to danger***
* ***according to the TransLegalProject (https://www.translegalproject.org/post/urgent-action-write-to-your-mp-to-protest-the-supreme-court-ruling-and-the-ehrc-s-proposals-to-impo ) trans people must not be placed in a situation where they are excluded totally***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.3.4 Implications for workplaces and services that are open to the public, part 4

* where possible, mixed-sex toilet, washing or changing facilities in addition to sufficient single-sex facilities should be provided
* where toilet, washing or changing facilities are in lockable rooms (not cubicles) which are intended for the use of one person at a time, they can be used by either women or men **or trans women (biological men) or trans men (biological women)**

***Problems with this text***

* ***insert the bolded text***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.4 Implications for sports

There are rules about when competitive sports can be single-sex, which we intend to address separately in due course.

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.5 Implications for schools

Schools in England and Wales must provide separate single-sex toilets for boys and girls over the age of 8. It is also compulsory for them to provide single-sex changing facilities for boys and girls over the age of 11. The law in Scotland requires schools, irrespective of pupils' age, to provide separate toilet facilities for boys and for girls. Toilet cubicles are required to be partitioned and have lockable doors.

Pupils who identify as trans girls (biological boys) should not be permitted to use the girls’ toilet or changing facilities, and pupils who identify as trans boys (biological girls) should not be permitted to use the boys’ toilet or changing facilities. Suitable alternative provisions ~~may be required~~ must be provided.

***Problems with this text***

* ***Delete the struck text and change the ""may"" to ""must""***
* ***The SC ruling did not cover school toilets. This is an extrapolation by the EHRC.***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

3.6 Implications for associations

Membership of an association of 25 or more people can be limited to men only or women only and can be limited to people who each have two protected characteristics. It can be, for example, for gay men only or lesbian women only. A women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men), and a men-only or gay men-only association should not admit trans men (biological women).

***Problems with this text***

* ***Why is this text even here? Does the EHRC have jurisdiction over voluntary associations at all?***
* ***Why two protected characteristics instead of three or four. Is the EHRC making this up at this point?***
* ***Does the EHRC realise that this advise legalises Muslim men-only associations and Muslim women-only associations? Or straight-men-only associations and straight-women-only associations. Or any other combination?***
* ***According to the Administrative Court blog (https://administrativecourtblog.wordpress.com/2025/04/30/limits-to-the-uk-supreme-courts-reach-northern-ireland-the-windsor-framework-and-trans-rights/) this is outside the SC verdict scope because the SC verdict did not mention this, and this does not apply to Northern Ireland because the Equality Act does not apply in Northern Ireland***

***--------------------------------------------------------***

4. Our work to update our guidance

Our updated guidance will be available in due course. We are working at pace to incorporate the implications of the Supreme Court’s judgment.

We aim to provide the updated Code of Practice to the UK Government by the end of June for ministerial approval. 

The Code will support service providers, public bodies and associations to understand their duties under the Equality Act and put them into practice.

We are currently reviewing sections of the draft Code of Practice which need updating. We will shortly undertake a public consultation to understand how the practical implications of this judgment may be best reflected in the updated guidance. The Supreme Court made the legal position clear, so we will not be seeking views on those legal aspects.

***Problems with this text***

* ***You do not get to mark your own homework. It is not the SC verdict that is debated but your interpretation of it.***

The consultation will be launched in mid-May and last for two weeks. We will be seeking views from affected stakeholders. 

***Problems with this text***

* ***according to the Tony Vaughan letter (https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/1kegrqq/labour\_mp\_tony\_vaughan\_kcs\_letter\_to\_the\_ehrc/) this is not long enough, so withdraw the interim guidance and consult with trans people/orgs***

In the meantime, we will continue to regulate and enforce the Equality Act 2010, ensuring protection for all protected characteristics including those of sex, gender reassignment and sexual orientation.",18,1747585200.0,transgenderUK,2,0.95,False

1kpnpbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/toRANTo/comments/1kpnpbs/im_not_gonna_sugar_coat_it_the_loneliness/,"I'm Not Gonna Sugar Coat It. The ""Loneliness Epidemic"" in This City (Esp. the GTA) Is 95-99% Self-Inflicted","I'm gonna call this out for what it is, cause so many others in this metro can't seem to. The loneliness problem in Toronto (***especially*** the GTA) is about 95-99% self-inflicted. It’s a region that’s somehow perfected the art of isolating people while pretending to be a “world-class, vibrant” hub of culture and connection. But based on what I've experienced and researched, people here seem to be socially deprived by choice, not just circumstance. 

First, the “busy” excuse. It’s the most common dodge in this city, and it’s absolute dogshit. Everyone’s “too busy” to connect, but not too busy to mindlessly scroll social media for hours, refresh LinkedIn, or book back-to-back brunches with the same 2 or 3 people they’ve known since middle school. If this place deserves a gold medal for anything, it’s for using *“busy”* or ghosting as the laziest, most cowardly shield against real connection, despite all the preaching about ""diverse metro full of opportunity"" rhetoric.

Then there’s the lack of third places. You know, actual gathering spaces where people can meet without a reservation, a cover charge, or two-hour sanity sucking commutes to the downtown core? And if you’re in the suburbs like Richmond Hill (like myself), well that's just a rat's ass situation at this point. You’re essentially a prisoner in your own overpriced, sterile neighborhood.  Funnily enough, Richmond Hill even wrote about their loneliness problem in their own news site, but let’s be real, they’re not going to do squat about it. They’ll slap up a few more soulless plazas and condos, and call it a day. In this city, it just seems to be home and school/work. Nothing more.

And let’s talk about essentially this “out of sight, out of mind” mentality that seems to dominate here. If you’re not constantly reminding people you exist, they just... forget you exist. You can disappear from a person's mind or social circle in a matter of weeks if you don’t keep up appearances. If you’re not proactive, you may as well not exist. I'm not denying the importance of proactivity in the initial stages, but it seems like even those I'm *way* past the point of acquainting myself with, there's no checking in or reaching out etc, and they certainly won’t make the effort to include you unless you’re actively *fighting* to stay relevant. It’s like you have to constantly reapply for friendship in this ""diverse and tolerant"" metro.

All things considered, is it really any surprise that we have this so-called “loneliness epidemic” and supposedly rampant depression when people treat each other like temporary coworkers instead of potential friends? Most people here wouldn’t even know the first thing about clinical depression (like mine) if it smacked them in the face. No, instead they’d just call it a “rough patch” or dismiss it as a “mindset problem.” 

Oh, and in case you’re wondering, yes, I’ve put my efforts in. I’ve tried reaching out, joining clubs and classes, taking initiative in making plans to build connections etc etc, only to be met with same trite flakiness, ghosting, and *“busy”* copouts I've had to since I was *fifteen* years old. I’ve had to remind people I exist just to get a half-hearted coffee invite, and if I ever stop pushing? Silence, because it's like most people here (like we're talking over 95%) need a notification to remember you’re alive. Or alternatively, this is what being 26 (and beyond) looks like, basically the human version of what animals in zoos go through (zoochosis due to confinement and repetitiveness of each day).

Side note, it's moments like this that make me wonder how similar we truly are to the Midwestern US (beyond geography), in terms of passive aggressiveness, lack of transparency, and sticking to those we know since before 18. ",34,1747584989.0,toRANTo,0,0.89,False
