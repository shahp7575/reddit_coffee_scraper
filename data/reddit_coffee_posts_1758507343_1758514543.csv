1nncokk,https://www.reddit.com/r/straightspouses/comments/1nncokk/my_ex_swore_she_wasnt_bilesbian/,My ex swore she wasn't bi/lesbian.,"Well...this my situation, but i need to say that we are still being very good friends. But by obvious reasons, is not like before.
To start, she and I knew each other since high school and started our relationship shortly before going to college. We officially broke up at the beginning of this due to multiple reasons (you can imagine). And she didn't have those signs that many of you have mentioned about your ex-partners. She didn't change her habits (not at the beginning), she didn't change her friends, clothes/style, tastes. She was always very feminine, even with her occasional plaid shirts that are already clich√©. 
I hadn't realized until now, but several of her crushes were quite feminine men. When we went out to the mall or the local cinema, she would point out all the beautiful girls and compliment them (I never heard her do that with guys),She said it was because she liked how they dressed or just their style, although sometimes her compliments were a little suggestive to the point where it made you think about her. Honestly, I thought before our relationship started that she was bisexual, but she always denied it, even got upset if I asked her.  Apparently, among our friends, I wasn't the only one who thought so. One of our mutual friends thought my ex was dating another girl, a colleague at work. The friend told me that she thought so because of how my ex acted with that girl. They looked like a couple. And when our friend asked my ex if the other girl was his girlfriend, my ex got pretty upset. In fact, during high school, she told me that she thought he liked another girl, but hours later she denied everything, saying that it was a joke and that she couldn't imagine herself in a relationship with another woman üßê. She did something similar in those weeks, I had asked her if she would like to go see a movie, and her response was ""sorry, I'm going with my girlfriend.""I was surprised, and then he said ""haha, that's not true, I don't have a girlfriend, I can't go."" Those kinds of jokes were a bit recurrent, when she was my girlfriend those kinds of ""jokes"" stopped completely and it even bothered her when I reminded her of it. 

Two years ago she had started to show a strange and even somewhat homophobic attitude, when one of her friends had left her boyfriend for another woman. My ex was weird, she said ""how can she do that, those relationships aren't right,"" she was uncomfortable every time that that friend of her family was mentioned. The same thing happened when we saw an LGBT couple in a park once. She was uncomfortable, but she kept looking at the couple, almost with interest. She kept talking about them (good things, bad things, etc). Sorry if this is too long, I want to give all the context from years ago.
Things got weird early last year. She'd given up her homophobic behavior and started talking to the family friend again. She started watching other types of series, Ginny and Georgia and Orange is The New Black was the main ones, but she watched it when I wasn't with her. Throughout the year things happened that made me think she wasn't bisexual, she was almost certainly gay.  She was more flirtatious with other girls, I once discovered on her phone a photo of a woman in lingerie, and two girls kissing. At this point the relationship was already at an impasse. She avoided intimacy, and on several occasions even a kiss, saying she wasn't comfortable, but I didn't pressure her to try it. We stayed together, but we almost seemed like roommates.Oddly enough we still had a lot of fun when we played video games or watched movies, maybe that's why we haven't finished yet. It's funny, isn't it? We were never very good as a couple, but we were good as friends.

What finally buried our relationship was what happened at a work party near of New Year's. I had strong suspicions that my ex had strong feelings for another woman at her work. Throughout the year, my ex had shown more interest in the LGBT community, and sometimes asked questions that made me suspicious about her and her sexuality. But she always said she was just curious. I don't know if she was cheated to me before, but when she came back she confessed to me that she kissed that girl I had my suspicions about (Although now, looking back, I do believe he cheated on me with another girl before. My ex started going to a coffee shop in the mornings and told me she'd become friends with a waitress, but after a while, she stopped mentioning it). She told me she only did it out of curiosity, that she wasn't drunk, that it was just for the moment, that the other girl told her she was attractive, and that my ex just did it. I won't go into details because it was a long conversation. But she ended up telling me the truth, that she had slept with that other woman.She swore she wasn't gay, that she didn't mean to cheat on me, but it just happened.We broke up days later. My ex tried to get us back together, but it just can't go on after that. Regardless of the fact that she cheated on me with another woman, she cheated, and there was no reason to stay together.

I didn't speak to her until around July. And wow, things changed quite a bit. She completely changed her style, now wearing leather jackets and patterned shirts, wool hats, and carrying a rainbow umbrella wherever she goes. She went to Pride in our city, and a few days later she started a relationship with a friend who had also come out as a lesbian. She apologized and confessed that she had always liked women, but was in denial, and thought that with me she could be ""straight."" And yes, shes gay, she always know it.  I won't lie, it did affect me to discover that she didn't really love me, mainly because I thought for a while that the relationship would go for a long time. Yes, it still hurts, especially knowing how happy she is now. She shares a lot of photos and videos with her girlfriend, something she rarely did during our relationship.I never understood why she denied it. Her family wasn't homophobic. I know this because her brother was openly homophobic, and in our area, they don't discriminate against the community. 

Resume: My ex swore she wasn't a lesbian and struggled with her sexuality, until she cheated on me and slept with a woman. My ex is now openly lesbian, and he has a girlfriend he's very happy with. I've accepted it, but it did affect me a little to discover she never loved me in that way.

Just thinking about it feels like someone pressed their thumb into the middle of my chest and will not let go. Still, if that day ever comes, here is the ugly, honest blueprint of how I will survive.

I will delete everything that smells like you. Hide or turn off my socials...  the whole archive of our dumb selfies and heart emojis. I will scrub my feed like I am cleaning out an infection. I will block you, not to punish you but because I know myself well enough to know I will crawl through any tiny crack. No crumbs, no excuses, no second chances.

I will find a job that does not make me pass the streets we walked. I will refuse to be ambushed by memories at every corner. I will stop listening to our songs. I will delete playlists and avoid that chorus that collapses me into a puddle between checkout lines. If music can be a time machine, I will burn the ticket.

I will move far. New skyline, new coffee shop, new everything. If nobody knows my name where I sleep, maybe your ghost will finally stop ringing my doorbell. I will revert to the old version of me for a while. Walls, quiet, fortress mode. People will think I am fine. Joke is on them.

When boredom gnaws, I will post nonsense to make noise. I will act like I do not care while secretly cataloguing every ache. Or I might do the opposite and fling myself from one person to the next. Quick warmth. Hollow mornings. Temporary anesthesia.

My liver will probably file a complaint. I will get a huge tattoo and another piercing just to have something physical to point at and prove I chose it. You are my last hurrah. After you, I might slide into grayness, safe and small. I might self-destruct and then, like always, gather the shards and rebuild something meaner, shinier, smarter.

Who knows... I might even beg or even gun for 2nd chance. I dunno but thats something i never did with anyone. I usually runaway from the pain and everything. 

But I pray that day never comes. I like where we are now. Messy, imperfect, alive. Things could be better or worse, and I will weather it all with you. Life is too short. I plan to spend whatever time I have with you, arguing and laughing and stealing fries and staying up for no reason and making terrible decisions and making better ones. I choose the harder, sweeter work of staying. I choose us. Please let that be enough.",1,1758513969.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False

It was always champagne at parties like that‚Äîthe kind where everyone was pretending to be effortlessly rich, effortlessly interesting, and effortlessly not dead inside. The penthouse of Moretti Tower, a glass-and-steel middle finger to gravity.

Sixty-ish guests swarmed the place, doing the same three things on loop: drinking, gossiping, and hoping someone was watching them while they did it.

The skyline of Atlanta sparkled below like it was in on the joke. You thought you were above it all, standing up there, drenched in LED light and narcissism. But the city didn‚Äôt care about your champagne or your secrets. It just blinked back at you, indifferent.

The DJ was spinning a beat that sounded like it was genetically engineered to numb people with too much money and not enough substance. Waiters glided through the crowd with trays of liquid distraction, their smiles tight, eyes glazed from too many fake laughs.

Everyone talked in whispers there. And they were all whispering about him. The man of the hour.

Giovanni Aidan Moretti.

The name was dropped every few minutes. The women‚Äîmostly silicone and sequins‚Äîstole glances toward the second floor, where a door sat closed. They tossed hair over tanned shoulders and tried to out-seduce each other with their whispers.

‚ÄúSeen him yet?‚ÄùOne blonde said to a brunette, her lips glossy enough to catch moonlight.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù the brunette breathed.

In the underworld, he was king. Giovanni Aidan Moretti was a name that held weight, not in the Instagram influencer kind of way. He owned the southern territories of the Moretti empire like they were Monopoly properties he was bored of collecting.

Young, polished, with that studied air of mystery that wasn‚Äôt mystery at all‚Äîit was distance. And distance is power. The party was in his honor. His newest ‚Äúbusiness venture,‚Äù whatever that meant. The kind of venture that might need a burner phone.

As sunlight clawed its way into the penthouse, the crowd dissolved. Vanished into town cars and rideshares, their high heels echoing like afterthoughts. The party ended the way most lies do‚Äîquietly, without closure.

And Giovanni was a no-show. Like he‚Äôd thrown the party just to see what would happen when he didn‚Äôt show up.

Champagne flutes lay on their sides like tiny casualties of capitalism. Napkins crumpled in corners. The dance floor had gone from glittering to grim.

At 8:45 a.m., the elevator chimed.

She stepped out‚Äîhair pulled back in a bun. No heels. No shimmer. Just a plain black hoodie, jeans, and a tote bag that looked like it had been through a few things.

Millie ‚ÄúMillie‚Äù Foster. Twenty-five. She was the kind of woman who knew that behind every ‚Äúfun night‚Äù was a morning like this one. Broken glass. Sticky floors.

Her eyes scanned the room like a detective at a crime scene. She took it all in, one disaster at a time. She headed straight for the kitchen. Priorities. Dishes clattered like bones. She moved with the rhythm of someone who didn‚Äôt need praise, just progress.

By the time she hit the living room, the sun was spotlighting the mess in high definition. She glanced at her phone‚Äî10:00 a.m. She needed to hit the patio or risk throwing her whole day off balance.

She bent to fix a pile of fashion magazines‚Äîcarelessly stacked nonsense designed to tell people whom to envy‚Äîwhen a moan cut through the silence. Not the good kind. The kind that made your blood run cold.

She froze.

‚ÄúWhat the‚Äî‚Äù she muttered, spinning.

And there he was.

A guy.

He was a walking clich√©, but the kind that still managed to punch you in the gut. Barely-there boxers rode low on his hips like they had something to prove, peeking out beneath a half-buttoned shirt that clung to a chest sculpted with just enough arrogance. Tattoos curled down his arms, visible hints of whatever mythology he‚Äôd decided to live by. The kind of ink that screamed, I make my own rules, but probably had a backstory involving tequila and ego.

His hair was artfully messy‚Äîthe kind that cost $80 to look like you didn‚Äôt care‚Äîand his eyes, a criminal shade of blue, squinted against the sun.

Who the hell is this guy? Her eyes asked the question her mouth couldn‚Äôt yet form.

Then, like some half-dead prince rising from the aftermath of his own party, he blinked at her.

‚ÄúYou must be the cleaning lady,‚Äù he said, his voice a gravel-soft rasp that slinked under her skin before she could defend herself. That tone. Weaponized indifference.

‚ÄúAnd you must be Mr. Moretti?‚Äù she squeaked and hated herself for the way it came out‚Äîlike a cartoon character caught in a wind tunnel of pheromones.

‚ÄúYou make me sound so old.‚Äù He groaned, dragging a hand down his face like he was trying to erase himself. ‚ÄúAidan Moretti. And yes, he is me. But call me Aidan. And for the love of all that‚Äôs holy, please do something about that window. I need blackout curtains. My brain is staging a mosh pit.‚Äù

Right. Blackout curtains. As if the sun was the enemy here and not the bottle he‚Äôd probably emptied five hours ago.

Millie didn‚Äôt say what she was thinking‚Äîthat maybe his highness could chug some coffee like the rest of humanity. Instead, she glanced at the window where sunlight poured in with the kind of joyful aggression that made people like him hiss.

‚ÄúBlackout curtains?‚Äù she asked, eyebrow barely raised. ‚ÄúThat might make the cleaning part tricky, Mr. Moretti.‚Äù

‚ÄúAidan,‚Äù he repeated, slower this time, like she was the one missing the point. He crossed his arms, exposing more ink and more muscle. ‚ÄúYou can start cleaning after I wake up.‚Äù

Of course. He was a man accustomed to issuing commands. But Millie didn‚Äôt back down. She never did.

‚ÄúYou can go back to your room while I continue cleaning here,‚Äù she offered. ‚ÄúI promise I‚Äôll be quieter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to sleep on the couch,‚Äù Aidan said, eyes drifting toward the spot just behind her. ‚ÄúSo, let me sleep. Wait until I wake up, then you can start cleaning. You can have a bottle of wine outside while you wait, if you‚Äôd like. Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt report you.‚Äù

Like he was doing her a favor. Like lounging on someone else‚Äôs leather sofa with a glass of stolen cabernet was a dream worth living. Millie bit her lip. Hard. This was already a scheduling nightmare, and somewhere out there, another client was expecting her not to be ten hours late because Giovanni Aidan Moretti wanted to nap.

‚ÄúActually,‚Äù she said carefully, ‚ÄúI have somewhere to be after lunch, Mr. Moretti.‚Äù

‚ÄúAidan,‚Äù he corrected smoothly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs skip the formalities.‚Äù

He lifted one annoyingly perfect eyebrow, wearing that face like a weapon‚Äîequal parts challenge, charm, and trouble.

‚ÄúI have another client‚Äôs house to clean,‚Äù Millie said, trying to keep it professional.

‚ÄúCancel it,‚Äù he said, like it was the easiest thing in the world. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll triple your rate.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you heard me, Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ôõ Beauty Sleep

Millie heard him‚Äîshe just couldn‚Äôt believe it. Tripling her rate? Just like that?

Of course he would. In Aidan‚Äôs world, money wasn‚Äôt just power‚Äîit was the answer to everything. Throw enough cash at a problem, and it vanishes. Including the fact that this man clearly hadn‚Äôt been told ‚Äúno‚Äù since preschool.

Millie chewed on the offer. Not literally, but in that way people do when money and morality are trying to arm-wrestle behind their eyes. Tripling her rate would quiet the demon light blinking on her dashboard.

But canceling on a client? That wasn‚Äôt her brand.

‚ÄúGenerous offer,‚Äù she said, and it was. ‚ÄúBut bailing on someone isn‚Äôt my style."" Of course it wasn‚Äôt. She had principles.

She shifted gears, recalibrated. ‚ÄúHow about this?‚Äù she said with the voice of a woman who had backup plans for her backup plans. ‚ÄúI can push my next appointment and come back later. Cleaning gets done, and you get your beauty sleep.‚Äù

Aidan stared at her. Not just looked‚Äîstared. And his silence dragged on a little too long, like he wanted her to squirm under it.

‚ÄúBeauty sleep?‚Äù he echoed, brow arched like a man who hadn‚Äôt heard a sincere compliment in years. ‚ÄúYou think I look like I just lost a bar brawl?‚Äù

He kind of did. And somehow, that only made it worse. Because he also looked like the kind of guy who won the bar brawl, then bought the bar, then burned it down just to watch the flames.

She shrugged. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean it as an insult. Just saying‚Äîyou look like someone who could‚Äôve used a few more hours of sleep.‚Äù

That earned a twitch at the corner of his mouth‚Äînot quite a smile, more like amusement brushing past.

‚ÄúWell, thank you. And do you want to know what I think you look like, Miss Schedule-and-Scrub?‚Äù His tone was light, but there was a subtle teasing beneath it.

‚ÄúNo need,‚Äù she said, cool and even. ‚ÄúI look like someone who‚Äôs here to clean, not make conversation or entertain. Let‚Äôs keep the lines clear.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Okay.‚Äù He let out a quiet chuckle, unbothered. ‚ÄúCrystal clear.‚Äù

But as Millie held his gaze a bit too long, she felt the smirk tug at the corner of her mouth‚Äîone she refused to let land.

She didn‚Äôt say what she was thinking: that yes, he looked a little wrecked, but in the kind of way that made people want to fry him eggs and ask if he was okay. Because that would‚Äôve crossed a line. And Millie didn‚Äôt blur lines‚Äîespecially not for men like him. And that was dangerous. That kind of thinking. Because it could lead somewhere soft. And softness was never safe with a man like this.

Then silence settled between them. She waited. Then‚Äîalmost imperceptibly‚Äîhis expression shifted.

Shit.

He exhaled. Not just a breath. A sigh.

‚ÄúOkay, fine, fine,‚Äù he muttered, dragging himself toward a bar setup she hadn‚Äôt even clocked before. Her eyes widened as he pulled out a bottle of rum. At‚Äîwhat‚Äî10:12 a.m.? Breakfast of champions.

‚ÄúChanged your mind about that beauty sleep?‚Äù she asked, trying to sound more amused than alarmed.

He twisted off the cap. ‚ÄúA bit late for that, wouldn‚Äôt you say?‚Äù he said, and then he did it‚Äîtook two huge gulps, straight from the bottle. No chaser. No self-preservation.

Millie‚Äôs eyebrows practically leapt off her face.

This was not part of the job description. Cleaning penthouses? Yes. Polishing marble countertops while watching a man spiral into a liquid abyss? Not so much.

‚ÄúUm, I think‚Ä¶‚Äù Millie started. She was trying to make this work‚Äîget out with grace, with a shred of her schedule intact. ‚ÄúMaybe I should come back when you‚Äôre feeling‚Ä¶ more yourself, Mr. Moretti.‚Äù

‚ÄúAidan,‚Äù he corrected again, and this time, the rum actually sloshed when he raised it, like the bottle itself was drunk too. ‚ÄúAnd honestly, you staying might not be a terrible idea.‚Äù

Ah. There it was. The pivot. The shift from hungover host to bored millionaire who hadn‚Äôt had someone tell him no in a while.

‚ÄúYou want me to stay?‚Äù Millie blinked at him, confused. ‚ÄúOkay. I can stay. You drink there while I clean. And you can pretend I‚Äôm not here.‚Äù

She was drawing a line in the sand, but he was already kicking it like a spoiled kid at the beach.

‚ÄúNot possible,‚Äù Aidan said, with that smirk. ‚ÄúI can hardly ignore your presence.‚Äù

There it was again. That glint in his eye. Not the dull stare of a man nursing a hangover. No‚Äîthis was interest. Mischief.

‚ÄúChange of plan,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúStay and keep me company. Cancel your other appointments. I‚Äôll double, triple‚Äîwhatever it takes‚Äîyour rate. Hang out with me while I finish this bottle. And once I‚Äôm too out of it to care, then you can start cleaning.‚Äù

Millie‚Äôs jaw twitched. She was holding it together, but barely. The man was infuriating‚Äîrich, reckless, and way too aware of the effect he had on people.

‚ÄúLook, Mr. Moretti‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAidan,‚Äù he reminded her again, with a smile. ‚ÄúThink of it this way‚Äîyou wouldn‚Äôt want me leaving a scathing review on your agency‚Äôs website, now would you?‚Äù

Oh. Wow.

Millie actually scoffed‚Äîout loud. ‚ÄúJust... wow.‚Äù She folded her arms. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve got a whole day ahead of me, and it does not involve babysitting hungover clients who use bad reviews as a threat.‚Äù

There was heat in her tone, yes. But underneath it? She was irritated‚Äîbut not afraid. And that? That made her dangerous in a different way. Because people like Millie‚Äîpeople with backbones‚Äînever backed down cleanly.

Aidan‚Äôs brow shot up, like he was pleasantly surprised by the pushback. Like he hadn‚Äôt been told ‚Äúno‚Äù by someone who wasn‚Äôt trying to sleep with him in years.

‚ÄúThreat? Never,‚Äù he said, so faux-innocent it might‚Äôve been charming if it weren‚Äôt soaked in ego. ‚ÄúBut a man of my‚Ä¶ stature‚Äù‚Äîhe let the word linger, inflated with smugness‚Äî‚Äúcan certainly make life inconvenient for your agency.‚Äù

Millie‚Äôs eyes narrowed.

‚ÄúYou stay,‚Äù Aidan added, lifting the bottle, ‚Äúand I don‚Äôt destroy your agency‚Äôs reputation with my fancy-pants connections. Deal?‚Äù

There it was again. The veiled threat, wrapped in a drunken smile and confidence.

Millie stood still, weighing her options like someone staring down a broken elevator and deciding whether to take the stairs. This was absurd, yes. Borderline unprofessional. And yet... the man was like a car wreck made of charm and unresolved trauma‚Äîyou didn‚Äôt want to look, but something in you had to.

She let out a sigh. One of those slow, begrudging exhales.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay until noon, and that‚Äôs it. Triple my usual rate, and you leave a glowing five-star review, mentioning me by name for exceptional service.‚Äù

Aidan lit up like a kid offered ice cream before dinner. ‚ÄúDeal!‚Äù he exclaimed, clapping once, loud and gleeful‚Äîtoo gleeful.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ do you have a name?‚Äù

Millie tilted her head but decided to give him the smallest inch. ‚ÄúAmelia Foster.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome, Amelia,‚Äù he said, with a theatrical wave toward the couch. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get acquainted.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt move immediately. Just stood there, tote bag still hanging from one shoulder, watching him.

And as she finally stepped toward the couch, one thought sat quietly at the back of her mind, What the hell did I just agree to?

‚ôõ The Offer

‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a hundred bucks for every can you finish, Amelia,‚Äù Aidan said, casual like he was betting on a coin toss.

Millie stared at the beer can in her hand, tilting it just to watch the bubbles fizz. This guy was throwing around a hundred bucks a can like it was pocket change. She was on her fifth, and the buzz was hitting, but it didn‚Äôt make this whole situation feel any less absurd.

‚ÄúThis is ridiculous,‚Äù she mumbled, half to herself, taking another sip. The beer was good, sure, but not that good.

Aidan, sprawled on his fancy couch, raised his glass of some amber liquor. ‚ÄúI told you, a hundred bucks a can,‚Äù he said, smirking. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre five deep. That‚Äôs five hundred bucks. And you‚Äôre still stressing about your next cleaning appointment?‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt even flexing, not really‚Äîjust tossing out numbers like they didn‚Äôt mean anything. It pissed her off, but she was too tired to call him on it. Besides, the cash was why she was here, wasn‚Äôt it? Sitting in this stupidly nice place, drinking his overpriced beer, instead of scrubbing someone's floors.

She met his gaze, her jaw tight. He leaned forward, his eyes sharp, like he was trying to figure her out.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, dragging out the word, a glint of mischief in his voice. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt exactly seem like the typical cleaning lady.‚Äù

There it was‚Äîthat patronizing tone, wrapped in a compliment. Like she was too interesting, too something, to be stuck doing what she did. As if her job was some kind of costume she was wearing wrong.

Millie‚Äôs fingers tightened around the can. He didn‚Äôt know her‚Äînot the overdue bills piling up, the late-night fights with her mom itching to shove her out, or the endless applications going nowhere. He didn‚Äôt see the exhaustion, the pressure, or the constant edge she lived on. And she wasn‚Äôt about to unpack any of that for some rich guy who thought tossing around beer and big tips made him different from the rest of his entitled circle.

She shot him a look. ‚ÄúGuess looks can be deceiving. You don‚Äôt exactly strike me as someone who‚Äôs ever touched a mop.‚Äù

Aidan grinned, unfazed, swirling his fancy liquor. ‚ÄúTried cleaning a sink once in college. Flooded the place. Total disaster.‚Äù

She snorted, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, sounds about right. Leave the dirty work to us little people.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre admitting you‚Äôre one of the little people? And you‚Äôre okay with that?‚Äù His smirk was back, all smug and teasing.

She leaned forward, matching his energy. ‚ÄúThree hours ago, I thought you were just a jerk.‚Äù

He raised an eyebrow, leaning in too, like he was actually curious. ‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow?‚Äù She took a slow sip of her beer, letting the pause hang. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre an arrogant jerk. With way too much cash to burn. It‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù

He laughed, clutching his chest like she‚Äôd wounded him. ‚ÄúHarsh, but fair.‚Äù That grin didn‚Äôt budge. ‚ÄúCome on, though, I‚Äôm growing on you, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a bad rash,‚Äù she fired back, but the corner of her mouth twitched, betraying her.

Aidan raised his glass, still chuckling. ‚ÄúTo rashes, then.‚Äù

She shook her head, watching him sip his drink. He was insufferable, but there was something about him‚Äîcharming in a way that got under her skin. It pissed her off how easy it was to talk to him, like he wasn‚Äôt some rich guy who‚Äôd never worried about an empty tank in his life.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said, setting her can down with a soft clink, ‚Äúwhat do you actually do? Besides sit around on a pile of money your parents or grandparents probably earned for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bold assumption,‚Äù he said, smiling like it didn‚Äôt sting. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre cute, so I‚Äôll let it slide.‚Äù He leaned back in his chair, glass dangling from his fingers, that maddening glint in his eyes making another appearance. ‚ÄúNow the real question is‚Äîdo you want the boring truth, or the version that might make you nervous?‚Äù

Millie‚Äôs stomach flipped, but she kept her face neutral. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù she said.

Aidan leaned back on the couch, all casual confidence, like he had nowhere to be and nothing to prove. His blue eyes caught the light, sharp and piercing, and for a second, Millie felt seen‚Äîreally seen, not just some cleaning lady blending into the background. It stirred something in her gut, a warm twist she blamed on the beer, though she wasn‚Äôt entirely sure.

‚ÄúSo the boring part,‚Äù he said, stretching the words like he was bored just thinking about it. He took a slow sip of his drink and then continued. ‚ÄúEndless paperwork, pointless meetings with people I‚Äôll probably forget‚Äîor eventually cut loose‚Äîand a mountain of family crap I‚Äôm supposed to act like I care about.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the spicier part?‚Äù he went on, his voice dropped just enough to make her lean in. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say there are names I can‚Äôt mention, places I can‚Äôt show my face, and nights I‚Äôm better off forgetting.‚Äù

Millie rolled her eyes to cover the shiver creeping up her spine. ‚ÄúWhat, you‚Äôre in some secret club? Running underground fight rings or something?‚Äù

Aidan‚Äôs laugh was quiet, almost intimate, like they were sharing a secret. ‚ÄúNot quite. But‚Ä¶ not entirely off, either.‚Äù

There it was again‚Äîthat glint in his eyes, like he was playing a game she didn‚Äôt know the rules to. He raised his glass, toasting her like she was a challenge he was excited to take on, or maybe just something new to mess with.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm betting you don‚Äôt scare easy, Amelia,‚Äù he said, her name rolling off his tongue like a test, soft but daring. ‚ÄúOr am I wrong?‚Äù

Millie felt that spark in her chest. Aidan‚Äôs gaze had a way of cutting through her, seeing too much, and the worst part was she seemed to like it. Although it threw her off, it made her feel unsteady in a way she wasn‚Äôt used to.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised,‚Äù she said, her voice wobbling just enough to betray her. She wasn‚Äôt sure if she was lying or not.

Aidan stood up, all easy confidence. ‚ÄúAnother beer?‚Äù he asked, but it wasn‚Äôt really a question. His tone said he already knew she‚Äôd stay. ‚ÄúThen, maybe later, let‚Äôs see what kind of trouble we can stir up?‚Äù

That was Millie‚Äôs moment to bolt. Grab her bag, mutter some excuse, and get the hell out. But she didn‚Äôt move. She just sat there. And her mom‚Äôs voice nagged at her‚Äîdon‚Äôt be stupid, you can‚Äôt afford to mess this up‚Äîand the threat of sleeping in her car felt way too real. Five hundred bucks was already hers. Two more beers would make it seven hundred. That was gas, groceries, maybe a week of not stressing about bills.

Be practical, Millie. You can do this, she told herself.

But deep down, she knew it wasn‚Äôt just that. When was the last time someone paid her to just be there, to sit and talk like she mattered? Aidan‚Äôs world, with his fancy penthouse and bottomless wallet, was a far cry from her reality, and for a second, she wanted to stay in it.

She nodded, her better judgment slipping. He saw it, of course‚Äîhis eyes caught everything.

‚ÄúGood girl,‚Äù Aidan said, his stride easy, confident, like a man who never had to chase anything‚Äîbecause it always came to him. He grabbed a can, cracked it open, then looked back over his shoulder, lips tugging into a slow, crooked smile.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said, voice low and smooth, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you and I get to know each other a little deeper this time, Amelia?‚Äù

‚ôõ Hopefully, No Regrets

Aidan handed Millie a bottle, fingers brushing hers. Contact. Brief. Charged. The kind that doesn‚Äôt just stay on skin.The kind of contact people romanticize in movies and bad paperbacks. Millie felt it. That involuntary catch in her breath, like she‚Äôd been jolted awake mid-fantasy.

Because who does this happen to? Not her. Not a cleaner. Not the girl who cuts coupons and drives a car with one working window.

Aidan stepped closer, shrinking the space between them. The city outside blurred into irrelevance, the skyline smothered as the curtains hummed shut.

And then it was just dim lighting, expensive shadows, and that sharp breath of space between two people who should know better.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù he murmured, barely a voice, more like a spell. His breath brushed her cheek. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs better with just a little bit of light.‚Äù

Millie should have rolled her eyes. Should have stood, grabbed her bag, and walked out with her $500 worth of dignity intact. But instead, she stood still. Caught in the moment like a bug in amber.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre used to getting your way, aren‚Äôt you, Mr. Moretti?‚Äù she said, her voice light but threading on edge.

Aidan‚Äôs lips curled‚Äînot quite a smirk. A dare. ‚ÄúAidan, please,‚Äù he corrected, softly. Like it was a sacred thing. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ maybe. But I don‚Äôt mind earning it when it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù

He leaned in, closer now. With no question, no hesitation, just raw, unfiltered heat between them.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he whispered, his voice a velvet caress skimming her skin, low and intimate. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pull away.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a demand‚Äînot exactly. It was the illusion of choice, daring her to resist.

And she didn‚Äôt.

Millie leaned in, not because it was smart‚Äîshe‚Äôd long abandoned that‚Äîbut because danger always had that stupid, magnetic pull. And then, Aidan‚Äôs lips crashed into hers, and it was anything but gentle. It was a storm of hunger, bruising and insistent, his mouth claiming hers with a deliberate, performative intensity that felt like his signature‚Äîdesigned to consume, to linger, to ruin her. His tongue swept against hers, teasing and possessive, coaxing a soft moan from deep in her throat as her body surrendered to the heat.

Taxi Apps and Booking in Moshi

Tanzania‚Äôs bigger cities, like Dar es Salaam, now use ride-hailing apps such as Bolt, but Moshi isn‚Äôt quite there yet. While a few app-based services pop up from time to time, most travelers stick with traditional, pre-booked taxis for their trips.

You can arrange rides to and from any location, including the airport, hotels, and safari park gates.

Local operators often confirm bookings over WhatsApp or by text. Knowing your ride is sorted lets you focus on your adventure, not on tracking down a ride at the last minute. When traveling at night, ask for driver details and check that the car matches the description. Always sit in the back for safety and keep your phone and bag close. Most drivers are friendly and speak some English, adding a layer of comfort and trust you won‚Äôt always get with public minibuses.

From Moshi to Zanzibar: Seamless Transfers

Getting from Moshi to Zanzibar is a breeze with well-planned taxi and flight connections. First, a taxi takes you from your hotel or guesthouse in Moshi to Kilimanjaro International Airport (about 45 minutes) or to Arusha for more flight choices.

A reliable Zanzibar taxi can be the reset button you need after busy days on the mainland.

Popular Routes and Costs in Zanzibar

Zanzibar‚Äôs Abeid Amani Karume International Airport sits close to Stone Town, but many visitors head further north or east to reach famous beaches like Nungwi, Kendwa, and Paje.

Route Typical Price (USD, One-way) Travel Time

Groups (families or friends of 3-7) save by splitting the fare. Larger van taxis can be pre-booked for comfort and space.

Every driver knows that clear communication is key, especially when you‚Äôve just flown over from the mainland. Many Zanzibar taxi operators have English-speaking drivers, which takes the pressure off tired travelers. You can share your plans, ask for a quick stop, or get tips on the best food spots along the way with no language barrier.

1nncjt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nncjt6/why_i_almost_moved_out_over_a_pan/,Why I Almost Moved Out Over a Pan,"I was ready to burn the house down over a fork. Okay, maybe not *burn the house down*, but my patience was razor-thin. It wasn‚Äôt a fork, though; it was *the* pan. Leo‚Äôs frying pan, crusted with remnants of what looked like last night‚Äôs experimental stir-fry, sitting in the sink for the third day running. Seriously, how hard is it to rinse a pan?

I walked into the kitchen this morning, bleary-eyed and desperate for coffee, only to be greeted by the same greasy nightmare. Chloe, our resident neat freak and early riser, had already left for work, which meant she'd seen it too. I could almost *feel* her silent judgment radiating from her untouched coffee mug. This was getting ridiculous. My internal monologue was basically just screaming, 'Wash the pan! WASH THE PAN!'

Tbh, I was lowkey losing it. We‚Äôd had a chat about kitchen cleanliness a month ago, and things were good for like, a week. Then slowly, almost imperceptibly, the 'just leave it to soak' mentality crept back in. It was always Leo, our free-spirited graphic design student, who thought 'later' meant 'never.' I scrolled through our group chat, drafting passive-aggressive messages, then deleting them. I didn't wanna be the house mom, but someone had to say something before Chloe exploded.

That evening, after Leo had finally emerged from his room and, shocker, walked past the pan *again*, I just blurted it out. ""Hey, Leo, can we talk about the kitchen situation? Specifically, that pan."" He looked genuinely surprised, then a little sheepish. ""Oh, man, my bad, Maya. I honestly just... forgot."" Chloe walked in just then, groceries in hand, and her eyes immediately landed on the sink. The tension was palpable.

Instead of letting it escalate into a full-blown argument, I took a deep breath. ""Look, guys, it's not just the pan. It's the vibe. We all wanna live in a clean space, right?"" Chloe nodded, dropping her bag. ""Yeah, it's been getting to me, too, ngl. I don't wanna be passive-aggressive with notes."" We sat down, and it wasn't easy, but we actually talked it out. We decided to try a super simple, visual chore chart on the fridge, just for daily kitchen wipe-downs and *immediate* dishwashing. We even assigned a 'Pan Patrol' day. It sounds silly, but just getting it all out and agreeing on a concrete plan felt like a massive weight off my shoulders.

Now, a few weeks in, the kitchen is actually clean. Like, *actually* clean. It‚Äôs wild how much better the whole apartment feels. We even ended up having a few more house dinners because no one was dreading the clean-up. We realized we all just needed a clearer system and to actually communicate when something was bothering us, instead of letting it fester. My mental health? Thriving. Our friendship? Stronger than ever. We love to see it.

It wasn‚Äôt premeditated or anything like that, it was actually the best thing that has happened to me in hindsight. That Thursday started out like every other vacation Jessi and I took. Wake up, coffee, argue about being late to a destination that we have no check in for, get in the car, wait for Jessi to go inside and get something she forgot and then, and only then, may we pull out of the driveway. We made our way up the mountain, singing along to songs that we could agree on and chatting about the scenery on the way up.¬†  
  
Arriving at the cabin, her eyes were wide like a child in a candy store, she unbuckled her seatbelt and leaned closer to the dashboard. Jessi‚Äôs mouth agape with wonder and excitement- brought only one word to my brain-

‚ÄúBeautiful..‚Äù I said under my breath. She turned to me and cocked her head to the side like a dog who heard a siren.¬†

‚ÄúWhat was that, babe?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre beautiful, the sun is hitting your eyes just like it did on our wedding day.‚Äù She leaned in for a kiss- having not put the car in park yet, my foot pressed on the gas pedal as she rubbed my thigh, moving us towards the cabin ever so slightly.¬†

‚ÄúHow about we take this inside?‚Äù I whispered in her ear. She tugged on the bottom of my shirt and nodded. I shifted the car into park, turned it off and got out with my eyes glued to her. That night was everything we wanted, from the arrival to the dinner we made on the grill on the wrap-around deck to the deep conversation we had over a hot tub soak and a glass of wine. It must‚Äôve been about 5:00 in the morning when I woke up in the hot tub, my face barely grazing the surface of the water. I looked around to see that my phone had died from leaving the flashlight on for us. I stick my arms out in front of me to feel around to Jessica,

‚ÄúJess?‚Äù silence.

‚ÄúJessi, are you still out here with me?‚Äù I kept feeling around the water, trying to guide my right hand from one wall to another. I begin to mutter her name again when I feel‚Ä¶ her hair tangled around my fingers in the water, the jet pushing it and knotting it with each current.¬†

‚ÄúJessica, wha- what happened?‚Äù I lifted her head out of the water and pushed the mess of blonde hair out of her face.¬†

‚ÄúJessica, please, are you here with me?‚Äù I began smacking her face slightly at first but more and more as she continued to not respond.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck, Jessica? Stop doing this, stop this.‚Äù I climbed out of the hot tub beside her, grabbed her towel off of the side and wrapped it around her shoulders before slowly lifting her out of the pool. I tried to carry her inside of the basement door without causing any more harm. I continued up the stairs until we made it to the master bedroom. I laid her on the bed and tried to warm her up and make her comfortable as much as possible. I still don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt just call the police and have someone come and help me. I was shocked, I was scared and more than anything, *I* wanted to be the one to save her. She married me and I told her I would keep her safe. I didn‚Äôt, I couldn‚Äôt. I laid beside her, putting my head on her chest and wrapping my arms around her torso. And for the first time since I was born- I cried, and cried, and cried.¬†

I woke up in the morning, my eyes puffy and swollen- crust filling the inner corners. I slid my hand out from within Jessica‚Äôs and rubbed my eyes, looking up at her face. I slide my other arm out from under her and give her a kiss on the head.¬†

‚ÄúI love you, Jessi. Good bye, now.‚Äù I walk out of the bedroom, close the door and walk down the stairs. I search Jessi‚Äôs purse for a lighter and make my way to the garage. A few jugs of old gasoline, paint thinner and a spark later and Jessica, her grandfather‚Äôs cabin and our car is gone. I stood at the edge of the driveway for a bit, watching the dance of the flames, sending Jessica away with the embers that flowed up towards the clouds. I turned around and walked back home.¬†

It‚Äôs now been six years at this point, and with Jessica not having any family and me practically faking my own death, I have an office job in a tech company in Tokyo. My life since then has been incredibly mundane- I don‚Äôt want to go through losing someone again. But, that day, I found her. I walked into my office and there was Jessica, sitting at the secretary‚Äôs desk. She was twisting her hair and smiling as she was on the phone. I pause for a moment, not sure if I‚Äôm seeing what I think I‚Äôm seeing and continue walking towards her. I stand by the desk until she sets the phone back on the deck.

‚ÄúJ-J-Jessi?‚Äù She turned around, her blonde hair whipping behind her beautiful freckled-covered shoulders.¬†

‚ÄúOh my god! Max! We haven‚Äôt seen you in forever! I missed you so much!‚Äù¬† She jumped out of her chair and gave me a huge hug, almost pushing me to the ground.¬†

‚ÄúWe? W- what do you mean, we?‚Äù She smiles and looks down at her stomach.

‚ÄúUs! Silly! Oh come on, Thomas is so excited to meet his daddy!‚Äù She smiles at me, looking down and starts rubbing her stomach.¬†

‚ÄúDad? Jessi, what do you mean? I- it‚Äôs been- I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù I pull my arms away from her and put them over my eyes.¬†

‚ÄúJessi? Max? Max, please, I need you to calm down.‚Äù I took my hands away from my eyes, Stephanie, the secretary, was looking up at me with her big soft eyes.

‚ÄúMs. Stephanie, oh my god, what happened? I-‚Äù She cut me off.

‚ÄúListen, I think you need to go home for the day, I‚Äôm going to let the boss know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt have to do that, I‚Äôm totally fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, I said what I said. Now go, rest.‚Äù She shooed me away with her hands. I turned around and took the next elevator down to the first floor to get to the train. I checked my metro card, went through the tunnels and finally got to my platform. I took the only open bench on platform 7 and placed my briefcase on the seat beside me.¬†

‚ÄúMax, max? Wake up baby, it‚Äôs happening. We have to go now. Max, wake up!‚Äù I shook my head awake and looked up, Jessica was bent over the side of the bed, holding her nightgown up off the floor.

‚ÄúJessica? What‚Äôs going on Jessi? Are you okay?‚Äù I jumped up out of the bed and ran over to her side. I placed my hands on her sides and helped her sit down.

‚ÄúYou stay here and I‚Äôm going to go get things together, okay?‚Äù She nodded and I rushed to the closet to grab extra clothes for her and I and rushed back to the bed.¬†

‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs go baby.‚Äù I lifted her off the bed and led her to the front of the house, slid her shoes on and grabbed the keys- walking out in my socks. I shuffled her to the passenger side door and started rushing around the front of the car when I heard a blaring horn and felt a hand grab the back of my shirt. I felt my body land on the ground, I heard my neck crack as my head smacked the floor. I tried to lift my body up and look around, the fluorescent lights blinded me at first.

‚ÄúHey man, don‚Äôt move okay, I called the police and they‚Äôre on the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù I asked as he helped me lean up against a beam.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the train station, someone tried to wake you up for the train and you started sleep walking or some shit and almost got hit by the train dude, I have no idea how I got to you in time. Something out there must be watching over you, man.‚Äù

The cops arrived right after he said those words, with an ambulance in tow. It‚Äôs now been two months since the train station and I ended up turning myself in, it hasn‚Äôt helped suppress Jessica from my mind but, at least I now share a prison cell with her. ",2,1758513530.0,creepcast,0,0.75,False

Hey there,

I‚Äôm looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I‚Äôm open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that‚Äôs just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I‚Äôm 33, 5‚Äô10‚Äù, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I‚Äôm all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that‚Äôs hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It‚Äôs my way of feeling close to someone.

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone who‚Äôs fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I‚Äôd love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who‚Äôs not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I‚Äôd be glad to get to know you.

1nnccjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1nnccjm/househunting_with_mil_open_wrong_closed_wrong/,"House-hunting with MIL: Open = wrong, Closed = wrong","**Long Version (sorry for that - I've tried to keep it as short as possible)**

After 16 years of renting together, my partner (ADHD, predominantly inattentive type) and I (ASD, CPTSD, ADHD) started **house-hunting.**   
**Trigger**: our **new neighbor** who drinks from daybreak 'til bedtime, **blasts past every boundary**, up to ‚ÄúI know when you‚Äôre awake.‚Äù and yells out of the streets in the middle of the day.  
**Cozy, right?**

**So here was my plan:**  
**1**. Call partner‚Äôs mom, tell her we found a house we‚Äôre interested in.  
**2**. Invite her to come see it too - so she wouldn‚Äôt feel excluded, and maybe she‚Äôd notice details we‚Äôd miss.  
**3.** After the tour, ask if she could imagine supporting us financially - always as a loan, never as a gift.

**Extra context:**   
His mom‚Äôs worldview...   
To her, neurodivergence is ‚Äújust in your head.‚Äù   
Same with diabetes. Same with anything LGBTQ.   
Same with depression - best quote there: ""Why feelin' depressed?! THe sun is shining!""  
**Basically**: **if she doesn‚Äôt deal with it, it doesn‚Äôt exis**t.  
**BUT** she believed a woman who told her years ago that her boy *doesn‚Äôt* have dyslexia. No.   
The one and only reason he‚Äôs having a hard time, apparently, is that **he‚Äôs not from Earth** \- **he‚Äôs an alien** on a strange planet., far from home  
Add to that: **she‚Äôs called me ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù for years**, ever since I once walked out of an overwhelming argument 15 years ago (winter, snow, just shirt/jeans).   
That‚Äôs her definition of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt talk to him.‚Äù   
So‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the baseline...

We wanted this **talk before my partner‚Äôs birthday** BBQ with his side of the family, because doing it there would‚Äôve been pure disaster.

**Instead**: *Chaos...*

**We met her for coffee first.**   
I wanted s**afe ground, calm setting**.   
I wasn‚Äôt even planning to dig into financing before she saw the house.  
**She asked, I answered.**   
**Felt okay** \- honest, open, transparent.   
Then **I drop the part**: ‚ÄúMy mom can‚Äôt put cash on the table, she‚Äôd take a home loan on her condominium instead.‚Äù  
**!BAM!** immediate tackle: ‚ÄúSo **you expect me** to do **THAT** too, or what?!‚Äù  
Caught me completly off guard...  
**Context**: his mom and my mom don‚Äôt like each other. Both‚Ä¶ difficult in their own way.   
I didn‚Äôt want his mom to think mine wasn‚Äôt contributing - that would‚Äôve turned into some petty ‚Äú**which mom gives more**‚Äù competition.   
His mom knows mine isn‚Äôt well off, and she loves poking that sore spot.   
So yeah, I clarified.

**Fast-forward to the house tour:**   
**instead of walking straight into the house with us** and the realtor (the place is right by the driveway), she says she wants to **check out the garden with her son**.   
I was already skeptical.   
So I started my task measuring inside ‚Äî some numbers on the plan didn‚Äôt quite add up.   
**Ten minutes later, they still weren‚Äôt back.**   
So we head outside, and there they are: both leaning on an old, oversized pool, **frowns** written **all over their faces**.   
**The vibe?**   
Meh.

Luckily, the realtor knew her and **pulled her into a long conversation**.   
My partner seized the chance to drag me back inside because he had something to tell me: **suddenly I‚Äôm told she ‚Äúfeels overrun.‚Äù**   
**Not even in her own words** \- my partner relays it.   
I cut him off: ""*don‚Äôt tell me more""*, **I‚Äôll talk to her directly**.   
But first, I finished my measuring - mostly to **buy myself a moment to brace**.

Inside, **she shifted back** into ‚Äúall normal,‚Äù chatting with my better half about how she‚Äôd already decorate the place.   
**She avoided me**, though, and that stood out.   
On the way out, **I finally pushed i**t: I wanted to hear it from her directly.   
**She avoids** eye contact, **mutters**. (I usually avoid eye contact too, but when I'm in ""**THE MOOD**"", I can stare people to death)  
**I clarify again**: the reason I mentioned my mom‚Äôs loan at all was exactly to **avoid** that kind of misunderstanding.   
Eventually she goes, ‚Äúyeah, I got it,‚Äù though **who knows if she actually did**...

**On the way back,** partner and I **explain why I‚Äôm the one talking.**   
He had money problems 14 years ago, so we agreed I‚Äôd lead the financial talk.   
**She stares at him** and defiantly **calls him a coward**.   
**I cut in**: nope, not fair. She has no right to insult him like that. (And who was the one, who avoided me a few minutes ago....? Right....)

**At her car, final round:**   
I repeat we want openness. And I want a (damn) response...  
Her response:  
‚ÄúWith you, one could never talk in the past.‚Äù then ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre grounded.‚Äù and the best part ‚ÄúBut now I really need to tell you something: I love you so so so so (way too) much.‚Äù ‚Üí hug incoming.

**And here‚Äôs the kicker:**   
She calls me ‚Äú**grounded**‚Äù while **my heart is hammering** at 160, **chest heavy** like a **Kraken squeezing my ribs. Stomach, lungs - crushed**.   
**Masking mode**: SURVIVER MODE.   
Because **if** I‚Äôd actually **said what I thought** (still polite, careful), I‚Äôd **instantly be ‚Äúthe bad one‚Äù** again.   
Why that label? Because I **don‚Äôt just swallow her poison**.   
**She doesn‚Äôt see what she throws out** \- ‚Äúcoward,‚Äù ‚Äúyou should be ashamed‚Äù (both aimed at my partner) -and **I‚Äôm the villain** for **pointing out the damage**?

So yeah...   
**Lesson learned:**  
*Open cards?* ***Wrong***  
*Hold back?* ***Wrong***  
*Coffee first?* ***Wrong***  
  
**Heartbeat like a war drum, Kraken on my ches**t - **but hey, I‚Äôm ‚Äúgrounded.‚Äù**



**TL;DR**

After 16 years renting, we‚Äôre **house-hunting.**  
**Plan**:   
**invite partner‚Äôs mom to a viewing so she feels included**, then carefully ask if she‚Äôd support us (loan, never gift).  
**Coffee first:**   
she **asks about finances** ‚Üí **I mention my mom** would take a house loan ‚Üí she snaps‚ÄúSo **you expect me** to do **THAT** too, or what?!‚Äù

**Tour**:   
she avoids me, **mutters about feeling ‚Äúoverrun**.‚Äù - but **won't say it straight in my face**  
**Calls my partner a coward.**

**Ends with:**  
‚ÄúBut now I really need to tell you something: **I love you soooooooooooooooo much!**‚Äù + hug (I hate hugs)  
She calls me ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù while my pulse is 160 and I‚Äôm **masking like old eldritch gods.**

**Moral:**   
Whatever I do ‚Äî open, closed, soft, hard ‚Äî it‚Äôs always ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù",0,1758513031.0,autism,1,0.5,False

Etong si Enzo, was the one who reached out to me on IG. We chatted for a bit, etc. The convos turned more intense woth each passing day. He was love bombing me, telling me how I‚Äôm the one, the he loves me (after 2 days), how it‚Äôs me or no one etc. I felt very overwhelmed about all of it, kasi tbh I was open to exploring, getting myself in a short term relationship, not even thinking of long ter, etc. Pero sabi ko why not give it a try kasi wala naman mawawala etc.

I was always direct with my boundaries naman, told him i wanna get to know him first, and he respected that. He apologized for the things that made me feel uncomfy and really tried his best to go on my pace.

A few days ago, was our first datee, quick lunch lang siyaa, everything was fine naman, we were shy but clingy. It ended well. But then we decided to meet again after class (he waited until after my class) to have coffee. That‚Äôs when i started noticing some things. He wasn‚Äôt paying attention to my stories, one minute he‚Äôll listen while holding my hand the other minute he would let go to chat someone sa phone, then kalagitnaan ng date nagshashare na siya abt his life, tapos biglang napunta sa usapan ng ex, he told me they weren‚Äôt together, like niligawan niya, then he showed me a photo of them saved sa phone niya, also that same photo was still posted on his dump. It actually made me uncomfy HAHAHA, kasi it contradicts yung sinasabi niya na mahal niya ko, he loves me but still he has a photo of his ex?

Then yun, medyo naging sour na yung mood ko after that towards him, although paguwi naman nasabi ko sa kanya yung sentiments ko, he apologized, and said that he felt bad. Pero after nun parang wala lang ulit. Thenn fast forward sa next dayy, he mentioned how he wanted to see me. So i thought, that since i would be in school, why not meet during his vacant, 1 hr.

So we did, i was expecting him to engage sa convo sakin kasi syempre, siya tong nangulit na magkita, pero NO. No substance sa convos namin, he was busy, and tired (valid) but i felt kinda dissapponted. I left na parang ay gusto ko na magdetach kasi hindi matchh, pero then we called, and surprisingly, that convo with him felt so real and good. It was a mix of landi, deep talks, assurance, laughter. It felt natural so parang naisip ko despite the red flags, baka puede?

I have high walls pagdating sa relationships, I don‚Äôt trust easily, consistent siya the past days in reassuring me, validating me despite the mishaps. Pero today something felt different. Low chats, like if hindi ako magmessage he won‚Äôt, kung mag message man siya, parang feeling ko he only did so to say na nagmessage siya. He would call me and we‚Äôd talk, ok naman kami sa call. Pero sa text talagang wala, i kinda missed him, wanted to talk to hin but he was so busy with playingg haha. Tapos yun, after niya magplay matutulog na daw siya. Kanina sinabi ko i kinda missed him, but i‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs more comfy na now compared before. And then, sabi niya lang sorry tapos matutulog na siya.

I felt medyo hurt, kasi kapag may problem kami, lagi pinaguusapann, like magsosorry, validate, acknowledge, make it work etc. So to sum, i feel like i am attached na, pero i‚Äôm loosing him na rinn?

The longer I stared at Jackson‚Äôs name on my screen, the more I could feel my panic fading. Though it was just being replaced by white-hot rage. Suddenly all the stress and frustrations from the past few days came bubbling to the surface. And now I knew exactly where to aim it at.

I answered the call and before he could even say a word, I screamed at him for a good thirty seconds, cursing him out, calling him every name under the sun.

I took a moment to catch my breath and in that transitory silence, he asked if I‚Äôd gotten it all out of my system.

I told him not all of it. But just enough to think clearly. Then I asked him to tell me exactly what was going on. No bullshit, no lies. We were well past that now. The situation was completely fucked and he owed me answers.

He took a deep breath. And then he laid it all out.

He told me that when we‚Äôd gone out that night, I‚Äôd blacked out bad. I was throwing up, acting belligerent, barely able to walk straight. It was severe enough that he was forced to sober up in order to make sure that I didn‚Äôt get myself into any trouble. By the time he finally managed to pull me out of the bar, he actually felt sober enough to drive. He still considered calling an uber but ultimately decided that it wasn‚Äôt worth it. So he led me back to the car and threw me in the backseat. By the time he‚Äôd turned the engine over, I was snoring, out cold.

The drive back to my place was smooth enough until he turned off the highway and onto the residential street that was just a few blocks away from my building. He said that all the streetlights were out, and he had to slow down and squint ahead in order to be able to tell where he was going.

It became so bad that he decided to turn his high beams on. There were no other cars around, so he felt safe enough to do so. But the moment that his lights came on, they illuminated what looked like a woman sitting on the road about a dozen feet away. She was hunched over, face buried in her hands.

He said that he‚Äôd nearly jumped out of his skin upon seeing her. Because she hadn‚Äôt been there before he had turned on the lights. I asked him how he could be so sure of that since it had been so dark out. He just told me that he was certain of it. She hadn‚Äôt been there.

He got out of the car to go check on her but stopped himself after a few steps. He said it was so quiet outside that it felt surreal. No wind, no distant sounds of traffic, absolutely nothing. But the most disturbing part was that he‚Äôd thought the woman had been crying. Her head and shoulders were bobbing up and down as if she were sobbing furiously. And she continued to do so as he cautiously approached her.

But before he could get too close, he decided to drop the issue. Maybe it really was a woman in distress. But his gut was telling him something else. That he was actually in the presence of something extremely dangerous.

He walked back to the car and shut the doors. But when he looked at the road again, the woman was now standing, moving towards us with these unnaturally long strides. By the time that he‚Äôd overcome the initial shock of seeing it, she was standing right in front of the car. He said that there was something wrong with her face. Her features were uncanny, stretched out too far.

He began backing up when the woman suddenly slammed her head viciously down onto the hood. And then she did it again. And again. He panicked and hit the gas, but she followed the car wherever it went, sticking to the hood like glue. Continuing to bash her head.

So he put the car in drive instead. The vehicle lurched forward, and the woman bounced off of the windshield, her body catching a split-second of air before landing. He stopped and looked into the rearview mirror, seeing the outline of her figure sprawled out onto the pavement behind us. Unmoving.

I was still passed out so he just sat there in the dark and the silence as his mind moved a million miles a minute. He wondered if he‚Äôd just committed homicide. But given how the woman was behaving, surely he had an argument for self defense?

He began questioning how the woman had even managed to slam her head so many times with such force. Each one had sounded like a gunshot, each impact shaking the steering wheel. What the hell was she?

Ultimately he convinced himself that it was better to go out and check on her. Maybe she had just been wired on PCP or something else. If that were the case, then leaving the scene would‚Äôve been a really bad look for him.

He crawled over to his trunk and grabbed the crowbar he kept back there. He said he didn‚Äôt really know why because he should‚Äôve been able to handle her without it. She looked to be about a hundred pounds lighter than him. She should‚Äôve also been dead.

He said that the closer he got to her body, the weirder he felt. And he only understood why once he was standing right over it.

It was a mannequin. Realistic but still utterly artificial. He reached down and touched its skin and all he could feel was cold plastic. This thing wasn‚Äôt alive. It shouldn‚Äôt have had the capacity to be alive. He tried picking it up and found that it weighed no more than ten pounds.

He went back to the car and stared at the dents that had been left behind on the hood. They were larger than he‚Äôd expected, looked like they had been caused by a wild animal. Then he looked back at the woman/mannequin and saw her sitting up. Staring at him.

He got back into his car and drove away. A few minutes later, he dropped me off.

He said that he might‚Äôve been able to convince himself that it was a dream or a hallucination if there hadn‚Äôt been very real damage done to his car. Damage he was forced to look at everyday when he drove to work. He also knew what he saw. How real it felt.

For the entire next week, he lived his life on high alert. He said that he wasn‚Äôt sure what he was expecting to happen. But that he sure as hell didn‚Äôt feel safe.

But nothing did happen. At least not that week. Life went on as normal. By the time that the second week rolled around, he was starting to relax. He still couldn‚Äôt stop himself from looking over his shoulder, but he was more willing to accept that it had just been a one-off incident. He had been dealing with something dangerous and abnormal, but he was free from it now. He‚Äôd escaped it.

But then one morning he got the email. From an address that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible. He said that the dread he‚Äôd felt while reading it was something you had to feel in order to understand. The email by itself would‚Äôve been ridiculous but given what had happened, this just about drove him to a breakdown.

I brought up the line about the sewer. How the person in the story had supposedly dragged her into one. Based on his account of things, that hadn‚Äôt happened.

I didn‚Äôt mean to make it sound as if I thought he were lying about that part. But I did. At this point, I didn‚Äôt feel like I could trust the guy. He sounded earnest enough, but I‚Äôd gone through too much to accept that.

He just told me that the woman was lying. He‚Äôd never tried dragging her into a sewer. There hadn‚Äôt even been a manhole nearby. I asked him what reason it would have to try and frame him for something like that. What was the point? He told me didn‚Äôt know but that it didn‚Äôt matter. Clearly it was trying to fuck with him. Mess with his head.

I then asked him the inevitable question.

‚ÄúWhy the fuck did you forward that email to me?‚Äù

He went silent. I repeated the question.

He told me that he‚Äôd panicked. That he hadn‚Äôt been thinking straight. I told him that wasn‚Äôt a good enough excuse. That he had no right dragging me into this shit. Why couldn‚Äôt he have just found five inactive addresses and forwarded it to them?

He said that he‚Äôd tried that, but it doesn‚Äôt work. They had to belong to real people. The email he‚Äôd sent to me hadn‚Äôt even been the original. That one had stated that if he didn‚Äôt forward the message, she‚Äôd show up inside his closet. So that night he had set up a camera to face the closet in his room while he stayed awake at a 24/7 caf√© a few blocks away.

When he checked the footage the next morning, he could see her face peaking out behind his clothes.

‚ÄúIt knows exactly what you‚Äôre doing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou have to follow the rules. It knows when you try and skirt around them. It won‚Äôt accept that. It won‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôll never stop.‚Äù

Then I asked him why it had to be me. A selfish question, but I still wanted to know. Why did he *have* to send it to me?

He just told me he was sorry. I told him that wasn‚Äôt an answer. Why me? Why did I have to be part of this?

He then admitted that he‚Äôd feel guilty about screwing over anybody else. So I asked why I was different. Why he didn‚Äôt feel about doing it to me. He clarified that he did feel bad about it. That he hates himself for it. But that I had been there that night. That whether I liked it or not, I was part of this. I told him that didn‚Äôt make any sense. I hadn‚Äôt seen the woman that night. I wasn‚Äôt the one that she‚Äôd first sent the email to. He said that I was na√Øve to think that I was separate from all this. That I wasn‚Äôt involved. That eventually it would‚Äôve caught up to me. That she doesn‚Äôt forget.

I asked him why he‚Äôd bothered to call me then if he was just going to justify everything. Did he expect me to forgive him? Could he not live with this on his conscience or something?

He said that he wasn‚Äôt expecting forgiveness. But that he still owed me an explanation. That I at least deserved to know what had happened.

I asked him why he‚Äôd waited all the way until now to do so. He said that he couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. That this was no longer worth dealing with. He‚Äôd deleted his emails; he‚Äôd stopped looking at his phone. But that doesn‚Äôt stop her. She always finds a way. He‚Äôs been seeing them written out on dusty surfaces or carved into trees. One time a barista had stared him dead in the eyes and told him that the woman was going to disembowel him the next time he went into a washroom before smiling and handing him his coffee. She couldn‚Äôt be escaped. No matter what he did or where he went, she‚Äôd be there. He said that he‚Äôs already put countless others in danger, and it‚Äôs taken him way too long to realize that‚Äôs exactly what she‚Äôd wanted from him. What she‚Äôs been using him for.

So he was going to put an end to it. But first he wanted me to know that he really was sorry. That he should‚Äôve ended it the moment he‚Äôd gotten the first email and avoided all this.

I told him not to do anything drastic. That there was a plan in place to try and deal with her. But he wasn‚Äôt listening. I think I heard him scoff. He said that everything had already been set in stone the minute that he first saw her. Perhaps even before then. There was no point.

The last thing he told me before hanging up was that this was not going to get any better. That I‚Äôd been warned.

I left the bathroom and had the cops trace the call. They pinged him in the middle of some forest that was about an eight-hour drive away. They said they‚Äôd send somebody out there to check on him but that in the meantime, we needed to get going. That my eyes were starting to get red.

They led me into a slick-looking unmarked SUV with large tires that was waiting outside. Sat in the back with me were Luke and a SWAT officer. It might‚Äôve been the same one that had been there in the motel. I couldn‚Äôt tell for sure. The windows were all tinted from the inside and the front seats had been separated so we couldn‚Äôt see up there. This is all to say that we could‚Äôve been on Mars and I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to tell.

Luke explained that the location of the cave was ‚Äúclassified‚Äù information. That I was actually better off not knowing. I just nodded.

Once we started moving, Luke took out a small vial and dumped out a single white pill onto his hand. He offered it to me. ‚ÄúCaffeine pill,‚Äù he said.

I took it, swallowed it back with water. I‚Äôd taken caffeine pills a lot during college and this didn‚Äôt feel the same. This felt a lot better than caffeine. I didn‚Äôt question it.

Luke told me to settle in, but not too much. We were going to be driving for a while. He asked me what my favorite movie was and then pulled out a laptop. We finished Gangs of New York and were halfway through Fight Club when things started getting really bumpy.

It no longer felt like we were on a road. If we hadn‚Äôt been wearing seatbelts, we would‚Äôve been pinballing all over the place. At one point the vehicle stopped and we could hear the driver getting out. He began arguing with whoever was in the passengers seat and it quickly turned into something heated.

I asked Luke what was going on, but he just told me not to worry about it. A few minutes later we were moving again.

Another half hour and we had stopped again. Luke smiled, told me that we had arrived. Then he asked me again how I was feeling. I told him I was doing alright. Still alert. But that the pill he‚Äôd given me was starting to wear off. He said that was a good thing. That they needed to be out of my system entirely in order for me to sleep.

We got out of the car and stepped out into the woods. Deep woods. The air was heavy with moss, pine, moisture. Tall trees and dense foliage all around. I was surprised to find that we weren‚Äôt the only ones there. Turns out, our vehicle had been part of a larger convoy. Four SUV‚Äôs total. Stepping out of the cars were more SWAT, some others wearing FBI jackets and cargo pants.

I asked Luke why there were so many people here. Specifically why we needed so much firepower. He just told me that the FBI were here to ‚Äúobserve‚Äù and that the SWAT were here to make things go ‚Äúsmoother‚Äù. I tried pressing him for some more information, but he didn‚Äôt seem keen on giving me anything else. He just told me not to worry. That my safety was everybody‚Äôs number one priority. I sort of believed him.

We ended up having to hike about another mile before we reached the cave. There wasn‚Äôt an actual trail to guide us, so I just followed Luke as we pushed through the thick brush until we had reached the clearing where it sat.

It was a wholly inconspicuous entrance. Just a slight opening in a rock wall. We had to duck down to enter it. Luke handed me a flashlight, though it really wasn‚Äôt needed. Because everybody else had one as well.

Like I said, I had never been inside a cave before. But this was a far cry from what I had imagined. It didn‚Äôt seem natural. Instead of jagged walls and narrow passages, it was a wide path that sloped down gradually. Not steep enough for it to be too difficult to traverse but just enough that if you started running down, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to stop.

I looked around at the walls, the floor. It was just smooth, remarkably unadulterated stone. The air carried a faint scent of mold. It was a hard thing to make sense of. Hard to believe. I asked Luke if they knew who had built this place.

He shook his head, said that if anybody had built it at all, they didn‚Äôt have the slightest clue who it could‚Äôve been. Or for what purpose.

Every so often, the path branched off. Sometimes into two. Sometimes three. Very rarely there were four or five or even six different directions to choose from. But I guess they had already mapped out the place pretty well because they seemed to know exactly where to go.

Soon the fatigue had become a monster. I could feel my eyes starting to burn, my lids growing heavy. Whenever my vision would start to blur, I would squeeze my eyes shut for a few seconds before opening them again. I‚Äôm not sure if it really did anything. I‚Äôd never been so tired. Sometimes Luke would grab me by the shoulder and squeeze it, telling me we were almost there. A line he repeated for hours. When I asked him how long we had been walking, he told me he wasn‚Äôt sure. That this was a place where clocks and stopwatches weren‚Äôt able to function.

After an unknowable stretch of time, the floor finally leveled out and the path opened up into a larger chamber. Based on the echoes from our footsteps, the place was absolutely massive.

I could hear Luke take a deep breath before telling me that it was right up ahead. We walked a bit further and soon we could see it.

Everybody stopped. I could hear several mechanical clicks and realized it was the officers disengaging the safeties on their rifles. The cabin itself was a peculiar sight. It wasn‚Äôt some creepy, run-down place. It looked clean, modern. In any other setting, it would‚Äôve been inviting.

Luke told me that once we went inside, I just needed to follow him. To not look around too much. That as long as I did that, I didn‚Äôt have much to worry about. I just nodded. I didn‚Äôt have the energy to question much of anything anymore.

Inside it smelled like dust, old wood, something else that was extremely unpleasant but unidentifiable. I did what Luke said and followed him close while staring straight ahead. But then we turned a corner, and I nearly had a heart attack when I saw somebody crouched by the fireplace, looking up at us.

They were pale, naked, hairless. Their mouth was hanging open and a thick, oily substance was dripping from their lips.

I asked Luke what the hell that was supposed to be and he just told me not to look at it. That the SWAT would take care of it if necessary.

A few more turns and we had arrived in a bedroom. One of the officers closed the door and then everybody gathered around the bed and stared at me.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù Luke said to me. ‚ÄúAll that‚Äôs left to do is fall asleep.‚Äù

I put my flashlight down and took a long exhale and then moved forward, crawled onto the mattress. The sheets were cold to the touch as I pulled them over my chest. As I laid my head on the pillow, I noticed another one of the pale figures standing in one of the corners. And then another one crouching on top of a dresser as if ready to pounce at any moment. There were probably more that I just hadn‚Äôt noticed. I did my best to ignore them.

I closed my eyes but despite being as tired as I‚Äôd ever been, I couldn‚Äôt stop my heart from pounding. I tried performing some breathing exercises that I‚Äôd learned long ago and just barely remembered. But they worked. Slowly I was able to settle down. Soon I had passed out.

And then I woke up.

Still in the cabin but not underground. Luke, the FBI, the SWAT, they were all gone. None of the pale figures were there either. I was alone. I looked down at my hands. Then up at the ceiling. The air was warm. It smelt fresh. I realize that I was no longer tired. Not at all.

Was this a dream? Or had I just woken up?

I sat up and got out of the bed and stared out the window. The forest was a bright, vibrant green. Blue skies above. A pleasant enough scene but immediately I could tell that something was off.

It was the silence. Something so absolute that it couldn‚Äôt have been possible. No wind, no birds, no insects. I couldn‚Äôt even hear my own heartbeat.

These details led me to conclude that this had to be a dream. It just had to be. Of course I had never experienced a dream that had felt so real. So visceral.

What was I supposed to do here? I tried slapping myself in the face a few times. But then I thought about where I was in reality and wondered if I really wanted to wake up. It might‚Äôve been preferable to just hang around here.

And then I stared hearing something. Sounded like a continuous succession of quick, distant thuds. Getting louder. Closer.

Footsteps, I realized. Somebody running. Soon a figure had burst out from the trees, moving frighteningly fast as they sprinted across the clearing towards the cabin. Although I couldn‚Äôt get a clear look at them, I knew exactly who it was.

And then I heard the door swing open. I hesitated for a moment before opening up the window and jumping out. I looked back into the cabin and saw the woman standing still in the bedroom. Staring at me.

Up until that point, I had never actually seen her in the daylight. And I wish that hadn‚Äôt changed. She looked like something sketched based on a hazy recollection of a grotesque nightmare. Large eyes recessed into the skull. No nose, no ears. Thin lips curled into a wide, hateful smile. As if she were enjoying my fear.

But if this was a dream, then I shouldn‚Äôt have been in any danger. Right? Suddenly I wasn‚Äôt so sure.

I was almost certain that the second I started running, she‚Äôd be coming after me.

So I tried backing away slowly instead. The entire time I kept my eyes right on her, ready to bolt the second she made a move. Which she never did. Once I was far enough away where I could no longer see her, I could begin to breath again.

But then I thought about how strange that was. Breathing? Have you ever remembered breathing in a dream? Was that possible?

I tried purging that thought from my head and turned around, began venturing into the woods. No idea where to go. But I felt more comfortable walking as opposed to standing still.

I walked for a long time. I could feel the fatigue building in my legs. It felt so real. This had to be real.

But it couldn‚Äôt have been. Because the cave had felt real as well. So then what the hell was this?

My brain could hardly handle it anymore. I closed my eyes and dropped to my knees. Why the fuck did I have to deal with this? Why the fuck I had gotten so unlucky?

Soon I could no longer contain my frustrations, and I began to scream.

And I only stopped when my throat went hoarse. When I could no longer produce anything more than a croak. I stayed kneeling as I listened to the dying echoes of my voice through the trees.

It had felt good. Cathartic.

But instead of dying out, the echoes became louder. And it was no longer my voice. Something much more shrill in tone. A sound that made my hairs stand tall.

Something was mimicking my screams, repeating it back in sporadic intervals. Each one getting louder.

I stood up and looked around, trying to pinpoint where exactly it was coming from. After a while of squinting through the trees, I saw it. A pale figure. The woman. She was sprinting right towards me, but in a strange way. As if her body couldn‚Äôt keep up with the speed in which she was moving, causing her to continuously stumble forward like a crazed, wild animal. Still screaming.

I turned and ran, doing my best to weave a path through the dense forest while ignoring the screaming. I was so focused on getting away from her that I hadn‚Äôt noticed the sharp drop ahead. It appeared suddenly, without precedence. And I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from running right off of it.

I was airborne for a moment before I landed rough, tumbling down a steep hill until a tree broke my momentum.

My head was pounding and my back screamed in pain. For a second I thought I was paralyzed. When I realized that I wasn‚Äôt, I slowly pulled myself up, stumbling down the rest of the hill before looking back up it, expecting to see the woman staring at me from above.

But she wasn‚Äôt there. And the screaming had stopped.

I began to feel some relief before the frustrations returned. What the fuck was she doing? Trying to taunt me?

I continued walking through the forest until I reached a small creek. I knelt down and touched the cold water and realized how thirsty I was.

The water was clear enough that I was almost tempted to go ahead and drink from it. But I decided against that, simply splashing my face with it instead.

It was so refreshing that I just continued to do it. That was until I felt something grab onto me. I wiped the water from my eyes and looked down to see a set of pale fingers wrapped around my wrist. Suddenly it yanked me down into the creek and I was forced to use my free hand to try and push my head out of the water before I drowned.

But then it just yanked me down again. Harder this time. My face smashed into the one of the larger rocks and the pain was searing, my mouth filled with the taste of copper.

The grip was strong enough that I could feel my hand slowly sinking into the soil below.

I grimaced, shook my head. No way in hell I was going out like this. I planted my heels into the ground and began pulling my arm back as hard as I could. But it still felt like I was stuck so I panicked, began stomping wildly into the creek.

I became reckless enough that I started stomping on my own hand and while it hurt like hell, I didn‚Äôt stop. Because I could feel the grip beginning to break.

Once it did, I was launched backwards onto my ass. I crawled a good distance away from the creek before looking down at my hand and it was a gruesome sight.

The skin was bright red, in the early stages of swelling. A few of my fingers were horrifically bent.

And then I could feel the blood leaking from my nose.

I looked back at the creek and saw the woman climbing out of it. That horrid smile was still plastered across her face.

I started running again. Sometimes I‚Äôd turn around and see her in the corner of my vision before she disappeared. Sometimes I‚Äôd see her head poking out from the trees ahead and I‚Äôd pivot and change direction. Sometimes I‚Äôd hear footsteps behind me which stopped the second I turned around to check.

I didn‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôd been running. But I knew that I couldn‚Äôt go for much longer. My legs and lungs were burning. My head pounding. My nose, back and hand were screaming in pain.

Even my spirit was beginning to dwindle. A part of me just wanted to lie down and accept whatever horrible fate that the woman had in store for me.

But I wasn‚Äôt ready to resign to that just yet. So I kept on trudging ahead.

Eventually the forest floor gave way to a perfectly sheer cliff. I looked to my left and right and it seemed to extend indefinitely in either direction. As if the world had been sliced clean apart by some colossal blade.

I looked down, seeing what appeared to be clouds floating below.

Clouds. That didn‚Äôt make any sense.

But then none of this made any sense.

Maybe this wasn‚Äôt a dream. But it sure as hell wasn‚Äôt real life either.

I turned around, seeing the woman in the distance, once again sprinting towards me.

It had been terrifying the first time but now I was just getting tired of it. Why was she doing this? If she wanted me dead, why didn‚Äôt she just go ahead and do it? Clearly she had the means to do so.

But then maybe she couldn‚Äôt. Because I wasn‚Äôt actually awake.

I looked down at the clouds. Then back at the woman, still barrelling towards me. I could try and keep running, but I had this feeling that it wouldn‚Äôt solve anything. That I‚Äôd be running forever, and this shit would never end.

I realized that she was trying to break me. That she thought I was weak.

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes and stepped over the edge.

The sudden weightlessness was jarring. My heart was pounding, and I could feel an electric jolt moving up through my body. But then came the numbness. The light-headedness. And soon I could feel nothing at all.

The entire time, I was waiting for the impact. But it never came. Eventually I opened my eyes and found myself suspended in a white void. It didn‚Äôt feel like I was falling anymore. Just floating in this surreal dimension that seemed separate from time and space.

I remained floating there for a long while. Which I didn‚Äôt mind so much. Because it felt nice, as if my entire body were enveloped in a soft, warm blanket. I could feel no more pain. No more anxiety. I felt at ease. As if this was exactly where I belonged. Where I was supposed to be.

Slowly shapes began to materialize around me. Colors began to seep in. Then I could hear voices. I could feel myself laying down, my fingers gripping cotton sheets.

I was in a bed. In a hospital room. I sat up and looked at my fingers and saw them devoid of any injury. I touched my nose. No pain, nothing swollen. ¬†

After a while a nurse came in and she seemed surprised that I was awake.

I asked her how long I had been out for. All she could tell me was that I‚Äôd been checked into the hospital for just north of forty hours now.¬†

It took a few hours more before they‚Äôd cleared me to leave. Physically speaking, there was nothing wrong with me. As for the mental side, they said they still needed to run some tests. But I guess I seemed coherent enough that they were able to put those on hold.

The nurse told me to wait in the lobby. That somebody would be picking me up.

When I got down there, I found Luke and Brito already waiting for me. They were both smiling. They told me how relieved they were to see me awake. I told them that I had a lot of questions. But there was one that I needed answered before anything else.

‚ÄúWhat happened inside the cabin?‚Äù

Luke told me that once I‚Äôd gone to sleep, the woman had appeared at the side of the bed, bending so that her face hovered right above mine.

They said that they tried waking me up, but I wasn‚Äôt budging. Then they tried removing me from the bed, but they ran into ‚Äúcomplications‚Äù. Because that‚Äôs when the entities within the cabin decided to start coming after them.

For a short while, it turned into a shitshow. Bullets were fired; several people were injured. But no deaths, they assured me. One thing they noticed was that the woman never moved. At least not from where she was standing. They could see her body shaking as if she were desperately trying but unable to do so.

Ultimately everybody was able to make it out of the cabin. I was still completely passed out, so the officers alternated shifts carrying me as we made our way up and out of the cave.

I was still asleep once we‚Äôd made it to the surface. I remained asleep for the entire car ride. They said that it almost seemed like I was dead, save for the fact that I was still breathing. They said it was bizarre. Eerie. They‚Äôd never seen anything like it and didn‚Äôt know what to do. Even the doctors had no clue.

They asked me how I was feeling, and I told them that I felt fine enough. A bit strange. A bit shocked. But I was functioning.

The last thing I needed to know was whether or not the woman was still there.

Luke told me that she was. That they‚Äôd set up cameras in the bedroom and were continuously monitoring her. She still hadn‚Äôt moved. And if she ever did, I‚Äôd be the first one to know.

I‚Äôm back in my apartment now. I know I should be relieved and in the ways that matter the most, I suppose I am.

But the questions and concerns still linger. The guilt as well. About Elisa. The others who had received the email and hadn‚Äôt taken it seriously because why the fuck would they? Even guilt about Jackson himself. They told me that they‚Äôd found his body in his car, parked on an isolated stretch of road. Gunshot wound to the head. I understand what he‚Äôs done but I still can‚Äôt help how I feel. ¬†

I still haven‚Äôt checked my phone. Haven‚Äôt looked at any screens at all. They told me that I should be safe to do so but that‚Äôs a leap of faith that I‚Äôve still yet to take.

I know it‚Äôll take some time for things to go back to normal. I hope that eventually they will.

But there‚Äôs a voice in my head telling me that it‚Äôs going to take a lot more to truly get rid of her.",9,1758512637.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Has anyone here ever tried to make it last longer? I‚Äôm experimenting with different solvents like DPG, TEC, and glycerin to see if slowing down the volatility can stretch it to an hour or more.

Do you think a true espresso soliflore (not a sweet coffee gourmand, but straight espresso) is even possible, or is mercaptan just too volatile no matter what?

Would love to hear if anyone has attempted something similar.

I‚Äôm Imansa, but you can call me Ima, think of it as the fun-sized version of my name! I‚Äôm an 18-year-old (born March 18, 2007) from the tropical paradise of Sri Lanka, where the beaches are dreamy and the coconuts are always falling (watch your head!). Just wrapped up high school with my A/Ls and I‚Äôm gearing up to become a Software Engineering wizard at ESOFT Metropolitan University for the next 4 years. Yep, I‚Äôm about to trade my textbooks for lines of code and probably way too much coffee! ‚òïüíæ
So, why am I popping up in your feed? I‚Äôm on a mission to find my main squeeze, a super kind, totally awesome guy who‚Äôs all in for a serious relationship, with big dreams of marriage and building a life together someday. I‚Äôm a total rookie at this dating thing (never had a boyfriend, oops!), but I‚Äôve got a built-in BS detector to spot any shady vibes from a mile away. I‚Äôm ready to meet my partner-in-crime for life‚Äôs wild ride! üöÄ

All about Ima:
Personality: I‚Äôm a sweet, loyal goofball who‚Äôs got a heart the size of Sri Lanka‚Äôs biggest coconut! I‚Äôm shy at first (like, hide-behind-a-palm-tree shy), and phone calls make me sweat like I‚Äôm running a marathon. I overthink everything (is my cat judging me? Probably.), and I cry at cute puppy videos or sappy movie endings. But I‚Äôm also funny (I mean, my puns are pawsitively purr-fect), honest, and always ready to make you smile!

Appearance: Picture long, flowy black hair, tan skin that‚Äôs kissed by the island sun, and dark brown eyes that light up when I‚Äôm laughing. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 48 kg, slim, and I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôve got that ‚Äúcute girl next door‚Äù vibe. Basically, I‚Äôm like a tropical smoothie, sweet and refreshing! üòé

Hobbies & Vibes: I‚Äôm all about chilling with a good book, jamming to music that makes my heart dance, or baking cookies that vanish faster than you can say ‚Äúyum.‚Äù I‚Äôm a tech nerd at heart, love a good beach sunset, and I‚Äôm a pro at tripping over my own feet while daydreaming.

I‚Äôm not here for short-term flings or weird pickup lines (save those for the rom-coms!). I‚Äôm dreaming of a guy who‚Äôs ready to be my best friend, my cheerleader, and my forever plus-one. Someone who‚Äôs down for late-night chats, building a future, and maybe even raising a tiny human or two (or a whole squad of pets, I‚Äôm not picky!).

If you‚Äôre 18-26, a student or a working dude, and you‚Äôre all about that ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get married and make epic memories‚Äù life, hit me up! Slide into my DMs with your first name, age, what you do, where you‚Äôre from (city/country), and a photo so I can see your awesome face. üòÑ

Quick heads-up: This is my second go at this post because I‚Äôm super serious about finding the one. No games, no drama, just good vibes and maybe a few bad jokes! Let‚Äôs keep it kind and fun, okay?

So, whaddaya say? Ready to join me for some coconut-chasing, sunset-watching, life-loving adventures? Drop me a line, and let‚Äôs see if we‚Äôre a match made in tropical heaven! üå∫

Yours in giggles and good vibes,

Fremont Street was a ton of fun and it made me realize just how badly I needed to see a huge group of people have a good time. This was the high point of the trip. It really is a place that has a little something for everyone. I loved all the different performers and the group dances were The Best!

Dinners: Le Thai and Bangkok Street Food. Both had great food and service. Could not pick one over the other but BSF‚Äôs crab fried rice made my week. 

Lunch: Tacotarian in the Arts District. Tried the vegan birria platter. So good! Walked around the Arts District and window shopped all the second hand and vintage shops. Had the loco moco at The California cafe, then ice cream upstairs. Both were great.

Writer‚Äôs Block bookstore and cafe was a nice, peaceful break from the heat. Baked goods/coffee plus atmosphere were perfect.

Hi everyone!

I am looking for both friendships and relationships. I am an introvert, but I need social time too and I love spending quality time and really getting to know people. I believe in being open-minded and prioritizing healthy communication in both friendships and relationships.

I am a big bookworm (give me cozy books in any genre) and a coffee junkie - my favorite vibe is having deep convos over coffee or an old fashioned. I also love going out in nature and I am an amateur rollerblader as well - very bad at skating but love it nevertheless. I am curious and interested in trying out new hobbies and activities as well, although I am heat and noise sensitive so I take that into consideration.

Hola amorcito, I‚Äôm Princess Sapphire.
  A faceless Latina Domme who owns your imagination long before I show my face. I don‚Äôt need a picture to make you ache; my voice, my rules, and my control are the things that haunt you. ‚ô°

I‚Äôm a switch at heart, but I‚Äôm reveling in my Domme side‚Äî bratty, sharp, and deliciously demanding. I love to tease until you squirm, talk down to you, and reward the ones who truly earn it. Edging, denial, and calculated control are my playground; watching you unravel is my favorite kind of art. üíóüêá

‚ú®And yes,‚Äî When you prove your loyalty, I become nurturing, protective, and tender. Iron will, velvet hands: discipline and aftercare in perfect balance. I adore being pampered ‚Äî lavish me with attention and I‚Äôll lavish you back. ‚ú®

I have a little thing for accessories ‚Äî thigh garters, satin ribbons, and cute bunny ears make me weak. If you want to make me very, very happy, bring me those pieces as part of your tribute; seeing you provide them shows devotion and taste, and it delights me more than you know. üéÄüêá

How to tempt me:
‚Ä¢ Come with coffee, a tribute, or the accessories I love ‚Äî empty hands will never impress me. ‚ô°
‚Ä¢ Be consistent ‚Äî fleeting attention gets you nowhere. üíï
‚Ä¢ Respect my time, my rules, and my boundaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs how you earn more of me. üíó

Who catches my eye: devoted, yearning men who crave to give themselves, who communicate honestly, and who surrender with real intent. If you‚Äôre mature enough to give yourself and playful enough to take my bratty bite, we might fit. üêáüíò

~ Don‚Äôt waste my time if you‚Äôre a liar, a freeloader, or someone who can‚Äôt follow simple directions. I don‚Äôt chase ‚Äî I attract and choose accordingly. ~

So, are you trembling yet?
Show me devotion. Bring something sweet for me to enjoy cielito hermoso‚Ä¶ Prove you‚Äôre worth my attention, and I might let you taste the honor of serving Princess Sapphire. ‚ô°üíûüê∞

Thirty years together, what could go wrong?  
I didn‚Äôt know that moment would be our last song.

A drunk behind the wheel, swerving below.

One final laugh, one ""I love you"" heard.  

Now my life is a hollow shell,  
Each step an echo, each breath a hell.  
Her ring still rests where it always will. On her side of the bed, where time stands still.

PURDEW CHICKEN TENDERS üëç


(Tingles): beer and wine

I‚Äôm keeping a close eye. What I mean is when I have these I only have natural foods like vegetable meats and cheese and nothing risky while drinking because the second I see a bump I‚Äôll stop with the wine 

I lost a 25 of pounds during this experiment. I currently have a flare-up on one finger and not my whole hands like usual because I had a pastry from a coffee spot I was not used to for the first time. I suspect the oil. When I suspect a flareup I take ibuprofen and one off the counter allergy pill and hold on for dear life. 
Also, I‚Äôve touched nickel‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm actually allergic to fake jewelry but it doesn‚Äôt do anything to my hands. It‚Äôs the food

Coffee at 8pm just hits different, you know? And probably isn't a good idea. 

I like cold mornings with a hot cup of tea, mecha anime, and long walks through towering trees. Curiosity is the coolest thing, and so is having passion about your interests in life. Being driven to always learn more and grow is rad. So is being multi-faceted; opinions are welcome.

Married with the two most adorable kids in the world. No bias at all I swear. So if you want to talk about suburban parent shit, I got you.

I read. Like a lot. Actually it's being a problem, I can't build bookshelves for my library fast enough and there are stacks everywhere. You're going to find me in 40 years buried under a mountain of half read books and I wouldn't want it any other way. 

You know what I've always wanted to do? Take a year off from life and rent a boat and sail around diving on sunken ships. That would be fucking awesome, right?

But you know what would be even better? Just a cool friend to chit chat with through out the day. One to celebrate wins with, support during losses. The type of friend to argue about which dark souls is better but also contemplate the moral repercussions of stepping on bugs (it's not ok, they have a right to life too bruv). Maybe it's you.

My wife and I were staying at her family's lakeside cabin to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary. The cabin was small, but nice. The weekend was warm, the weather was good, and the lake looked like heaven. Her family had warned us not to swim in the lake ‚Äî some sort of parasites or something. I figured as long as we didn't put our heads under the water we would be fine.

We had arrived late on the Friday night and, as such, hadn't looked around much until the Saturday.

My wife and I sat on the shore, drinking our coffees, the lake sparkling like liquid glass in the early morning sunlight. I don't recall what we talked about, but eventually we arrived at the topic of the lake and the island in its center.

‚ÄúIt's not that far, I bet we could swim to it,‚Äù I mused.

‚ÄúWell, if it weren't for the parasites,‚Äù Sarah replied.

‚ÄúIf we keep our heads above the water we‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù I coaxed, getting up from the love seat and picking up my towel from the porch railing.

A few minutes later the two of us were splashing in the lake, talking and laughing like children at the beach.

We were both decent swimmers, so we didn't think much of the relatively short distance to the island as we began to swim out towards it, careful to keep our heads above the water.

The island wasn't anything special: a few birds, some living, a couple dead. Looking back, the lack of birdsong was odd, but at the time we were both distracted by having the whole island to ourselves.

We stayed on the island for most of the morning. There was a small pier and a quaint little run-down cabin on the island, but that was nothing unusual in the area. As the morning drew on we sat on the pier talking, our feet splashing in the water.

‚ÄúSo, what should we do for lunch? Beef or chicken?‚Äù I asked, a tinge of hunger sitting at the edge of my mind.

‚ÄúChicken, I've been looking forward to trying that new recipe you found,‚Äù she replied.

‚ÄúOk, last one back cooks!‚Äù I said as I jumped into the water. My wife jumped in after me as we began swimming back to the shore in front of the cabin.

The rest of the weekend went by in a blur.

Ever since we got back to our apartment she had been acting a little odd, the tone of her voice would occasionally drop to a flat monotone, or just be wrong for what she was saying. She also had a cough though, so I figured her throat was just playing up. I had a big project at work, so I tried to keep a little space between us to avoid catching whatever she had. She adamantly denied being sick.

There were a few moments that stood out over the last few weeks.

I walked into the bathroom to brush my teeth and found Sarah standing in front of the mirror, her face cycling through several different expressions, talking in different voices. First a deep, almost masculine voice, then a childlike voice, then one that almost sounded like me. Her head snapped around to look straight at me, the voices and facial expressions stopping instantly.

Another time I saw her looking straight at the ceiling, mouth wide open, both hands clawing desperately at the inside of her own mouth.

And most recently I got up to get a drink in the night and found her standing in the kitchen, hunched over in front of the fridge, eating raw fish. When she saw me she dropped to all fours and scrambled down the hall.

Each time she denied any knowledge of what I was talking about when I confronted her.

She had begun to seem distant over the past week, so when I heard her calling over the sound of the shower, I thought that maybe I was just being paranoid. Maybe I had just been imagining the distance.

The warm, steamy air hit my face as I opened the bathroom door. I stepped inside to find the shower empty. Before I could look around the room she grabbed me from behind the door and pulled me into a passionate kiss. It was a perfect moment for the second before I felt the crab-like legs grabbing at my tongue. I tried to pull away, but whatever it was in my wife's mouth bit down painfully on my tongue as something slimy, round, and squishy slid down my tongue and into my mouth, then it let go.

I recoiled, coughing and gagging. Whatever it was bit down on the back of my tongue. My wife smiled at me, mouth wide open. Behind her teeth I could see a bug-like face staring at me, its two front legs clawing at her bottom lip.

I could feel the legs working their way under my tongue, scraping and tearing away the flesh beneath as they searched for a foothold. I tried to scream, to cry out, but no sound came. I tried to pull whatever it was out with my hands, but it forced my jaw closed.

As soon as I stopped trying to pull it out I felt it move my jaw as my voice filled the room.

‚ÄúWhat's... what's for... for dinner honey,‚Äù the tone and inflection changing and morphing with each word, getting closer and closer to my voice.

Please, stay out of the water.",4,1758511294.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I have worked for my store for 2 and a half years, I was a supervisor for about 6 months early on but stepped back down to associate because of personal issues that I decided made it unfair for me to keep that position from someone else. Since then when have changed store managers twice and got our old lead manager(2nd in charge) back. J our new SM is a great guy and K (2nd) has always been amazing and I was thrilled she came back.  After the last SM left I have been  voicing that I would like to be a supervisor again now that things have settled at home. 
  I know just because I want a position doesn't mean I get it so I've been making sure to help how ever I can and go above and beyond in what ever I could i.e helping teach new hires, helping the new SM with issues any issues he had, calling the help desk for issues, food/coffee runs, starting and running the stores social media(per SM's request) truck team, markdown team, party planing/potluck planning etc. Never an issue, never told anything was wrong, always praised on being a great employee.  2 months ago my older brother passed away and I was crushed, I took my  3 bereavement days and 4 days I already had off before coming back.  About a month or so ago they rehired a girl we'll call V.  I didnt have have a problem with V and we generally picked on each other like sisters or hit on each other( nothing to crazy or uncomfortable) but when she left we were both sups. And had an argument, we made up 10 mins later but she walked out and quit.  I was excited she was coming back and we laughed about the whole ordeal like it was so stupid.  
  2 weeks after V came back a new girl, T, told me that she and V were going to be sups, I went told K and asked her if the was true and she said yes but they were seeing if they could and another supervisor position and then the would add me too.  I left the office but that stung a little but I let it go and went on.  Last week I pulled into work not really feeling it but still trying V told me I looked like a BA and I said thanks still in my car, then she turned to K and told her she didn't recognize me and thought they were gonna be robbed.  It felt high schoolish, but I tried to brush it off and went in.  Greeted T like ""heyyy boss lady"" and went to put up my lunch, side note it was a day we had truck and we have potluck those days but I hadn't heard anything about it.  T came in as I was locking my locker and asked what we were doing for potluck, I nonchalantly replied ""fuck if I know I just brought my lunch"" (not an uncommon response for me in employee only areas) and I walked out of the break room.  While waiting for the truck J gave everyone tasks and turned to T and V and told them they were the managers on duty, it reminded me that I had been looked over for the position and it hurt so I figured since I was not really cheery I would just keep to myself and just do my tasks.  Truck shows up we unload and start getting it unboxed and out on the floor, some of the boxes are long so I asked V if she could turn hers so I could put the last of this set on the table and it had a quick exchange:
Me: hey V can you turn your box so this one will fit?
V: sure you happy now
Me: nope never happy
V: yeah I can tell your miserable 
Me: yup that's me miserable b*tch
I assumed it was our usual banter put the box on the table and went to go to the bathroom.  While I was waited K came and told me she was feeling some hostility between me and V and didn't want any issues so we needed to come to the office. We sit down V says she has no issues, I relay the box thing and that we weren't serious and V says if someone give attitude she's giving it back. I was confused I said I hardly spoke to anyone today what did I do, V said she wasn't the only one who thought so and did I want to get the other person, I said sure.  She came back with T who said the exchange in the breaktoom was filled with attitude why would I say that to her.  Again I'm confused I didn't snap at her and like I said that's a pretty common response from me in areas with no customers. I continue to tell all 3 to just leave me be and I am fine but now it's 3 against 1 talking over me interrupting, not letting me talk and rapid fire ""what's wrong, somethings wrong, why are you upset, why do you have an attitude?"" I snapped, I slammed my hand on the desk and shouted pointing at K "" you want to know what's wrong you and J kept telling me when a position came up you would get me in and you skipped over me twice!"" 
  T and V asked like 5 times that it wasn't them i said no, so they walked out and told J to come in where I told him the same thing; for months I had been hyped up to believe that I would be a supervisor and had been taking on extra to show I  still could, that they had lied to me and while I know it's a business but that hurt to constantly be told how great i was and everything but not good enough. K was focused mostly on the fact that i called her a liar, J started telling me that here lately i had been giving 110% like I used to and that it was the little things such as i left my drink on the back counter twice, I sometimes forgot my walkie talkie, every time there's an issue I have to come up with a better solution, I've been on my phone on the floor.  Now to be fair the walkie talkie is considered part of our uniform when we are clocked in, and the drink I had been told that's no lie and my fault, the phone was making content for the 5 socials I had made like he asked, and if you ask me for ideas I give them not trying to one up anyone.  I chose not to remind them that I was still working through my brothers passing because they were going on about how I was good enough and they did care about me and they discussed it for days before choosing T and V.  That V didnt even was the position.  That hurt even more. I did point out that in those 2 months they never gave me any criticism on my work only praise and they said they should have communicated with me better.  I told them the damage was done and couldn't be undone I would be putting in my notice when I found a new job.  J then told me "" we'll now the management team isn't complete"" it is, all the spots have been filled.  I started to feel trapped and I just wanted out of the office so I just nodded said yep sure were all good let's go back to work, K hugged me and told me I wasn't going anywhere and to stop looking for a new job, V and T came back we all said we are good and went out.  One of the other associates told me when V and T came out the first time the didnt go back to work but off to the side to whisper and giggle like high school mean girls.  I felt ambushed, hurt, deceived, and gaslight. ",1,1758511223.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I needed a new apartment to stay in after my ex cheated on me with another man. He and I were together for six months and decided to get our own place. We were great, never got into any arguments, did chores together, and watched all kinds of shows and movies as a couple. It was only a couple of weeks in when we started arguing, always about little things, such as chores or if I mentioned a friend, especially if it was a guy. Every fight we had drifted us further apart. Until one day I came home from work and saw him and another man on the couch, completely naked. God, how I wish I had never found out. I yelled at him and ran out of the apartment crying. I went back a couple of hours later to get my stuff and leave. He didn't even try to confront me; he just sat on that filthy couch in silence.

I had to wait a few weeks for the lease to end so I could move on, sometimes sleeping in my car or at work. Then I came across an ad on Craigslist. (NEED NEW ROOMMATE: RENT $150/MONTH). I was excited and replied as fast as I could. I didn‚Äôt bother reading most of the post, just that his last roommate had moved away, and that he was deaf.

I didn‚Äôt find anything wrong with the post; the only thing I was wary about was that he was deaf. Only after I replied was I curious about how we would communicate, since I didn‚Äôt know any sign language. He was quick to respond, saying I could move in whenever I liked. I asked about the communication between us if I moved in. He assured me that I wasn‚Äôt a problem since he had notepads all around the apartment, as well as reading lips. I told him I‚Äôd be there tomorrow, and he sent me the address with a thumbs-up emoji.

The next morning, I made my way over to the man‚Äôs apartment. It was in a rough neighborhood, but I needed a place to stay, and $150 is a great deal. I went up the shaky stairs to the man‚Äôs door and knocked, only to realize that he wouldn‚Äôt hear it. I texted him I was there, and he opened up the door, like he was waiting for me. I was a bit startled when he flung the door open, but I put on a quick smile and reached to shake his hand.

‚ÄúHi! It‚Äôs nice to meet you. I‚Äôm Morgan.‚Äù

He grabbed my hand firmer than I expected and outstretched his arm to welcome me in. The inside of the apartment was very clean and tidy; a lot nicer than I expected from the outside of the building. The apartment had four rooms: one bathroom, two bedrooms, and the living room/kitchen. He follows behind me close into the apartment, so close actually that I could feel his breath on my neck. I played it off, thinking that maybe his social skills weren‚Äôt that great.¬†

He sits down at the dining table behind the couch in the living room and offers for me to sit down. I sat down across from him as he started to write on his notepad.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alone?‚Äù I was a bit puzzled by his question.

‚ÄúYes, I am. Are you sure 150 is enough? This place is really nice.‚Äù

He scribbles down on his notepad.

‚ÄúYes. Rent is $150. The landlord and I have an agreement.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, okay. I only plan on staying for a couple of months until I can get my own place.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem. As long as you pay, you can stay for as long as you like.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, I really appreciate it!‚Äù

He smiles and nods his head and asks if I‚Äôd like anything to eat, I declined but thanked him again for the offer.¬†

After our exchange, he showed me to my room, and I went in to unpack. The room was bare, with only a bed set up with a TV on the dresser. He stayed by the door and watched me unpack everything for 15 minutes before going into the living room. I stayed in my room most of the day to set up my room and unwind. I only heard him get up from the living room a handful of times to go into the kitchen and slam the cabinets around. Apparently, he doesn't know how loud those cabinets are; it sounded like thunder the way they echoed into my room. I went out and tapped him on the shoulder to let him know I was done and heading to bed soon. He grabbed the notepad off the couch next to him and started writing.

‚ÄúI ordered pizza online if you wanted any. Should be here soon.‚Äù

I told him, 'Sure,' and joined him on the couch, turning on the TV. The TV¬† flickered on with the biggest subtitles I‚Äôve ever seen; they took up a good half of the TV. I started flipping through channels for a while until he snatched the remote from my hand and put on reruns of ‚ÄòThe Twilight Zone‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt complain since it was his TV and I love the show anyway.¬†

Only 10 minutes go by before I hear a knock at the door. I tap him on the shoulder and tell him the pizza is here. He nods, and I get up to answer the door. I get the pizza and place it on the dining table. I tell him I have to use the bathroom first, and he gives me a thumbs-up for going to the table. I come back into the living room, and he has a slice for me ready on a plate. He waves his hand towards it to have me join him. I sit and look at the slice, and it looks like he has put Parmesan on it for me already. I took a bite, and it was chalky with a slightly sour taste; I thought maybe it had expired.

We finished the meal, and I thanked him again, letting him know I was heading to bed. He grabbed his notepad and said it was his pleasure, then told me to get some sleep. I go to bed and wake up a couple of times with stomach pains. I had to keep going to the bathroom all night. Luckily, the bathroom was right across from my room. I didn‚Äôt get any sleep.

I got up in the morning and saw him at the dining table, looking out the window until he noticed me. He had a coffee waiting for me. I sit down and sip on the coffee. Then I saw him writing.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you sleep?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot great, I think that pizza made me sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm not feeling well either.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking a sick day, I need some sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúHope you feel better.‚Äù

I said ‚ÄòYou too‚Äô before going back to bed. It was almost noon by the time I woke up again. I open my eyes to see him standing at the foot of my bed with a kitchen knife. I was terrified, but he panicked and shook his head and arms around. He grabbed his notepad from his pocket.

‚ÄúI thought I saw a mouse.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you not do that in my room?! You gave me a heart attack!‚Äù

He apologized and left my room.¬†

After that, we didn‚Äôt interact too much, just in passing. Whenever I left for work or to get groceries, he was always home, reading. I don‚Äôt think he worked or ever left the apartment. He was always there when I was.¬†

My friend texted me asking to see my new apartment. I agreed since I hadn‚Äôt seen her in forever. She knocked, and I answered the door and greeted her. I introduced her to my new roommate, and he seemed displeased. He went to write on his notepad.

‚ÄúNice to meet you. I didn‚Äôt know we were having company.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I should have asked.‚Äù He put on a fake smile.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm heading to my room.‚Äù

My friend and I sat on the couch and talked about everything going on. She asked what it was like living with a deaf man. I said it wasn‚Äôt too bad and joked, saying he didn‚Äôt talk much. She stayed for a while and left when night came around. I texted my roommate saying she was gone, but he never responded by the time I went to bed.

In the middle of the night, I woke up in my dark room, with a heavy weight on me, unable to move. The man was on top of me with his hands around my neck. I was barely able to breathe. I struggled with him, trying to get him off. I was able to reach the alarm clock on my nightstand and hit him with it. He finally let go. I grabbed my phone and ran into the bathroom, locked the door, and called the police.

‚ÄúPolice have been dispatched to your location. They‚Äôll be there soon. Please stay on the line.

My whole body was pressed against the door. He pounded harder and harder on the door to get in. I was crying and sobbing, wishing it would end. He stepped away from the door, and I had some sense of relief for a second. I heard him run into his room, only to run back to the door. This time, he pounded the door with something heavy. My heart sank.

‚ÄúPlease hurry! He has something! He‚Äôs trying to kill me!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be there in a minute, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

Each pound of the door was thunderous. Each time he would hit the door, I would hear a crack‚Äîonly a few swings in, he had made an opening into the door. He tried reaching in to unlock the door, and I hit his hand as hard as I could. He let out an awful scream of pain before swinging at the door again.¬†

He finally broke in with the hammer he had used. I ripped off the shower rod and hit him with it, but it didn‚Äôt do much. He swung the hammer into my side, feeling my ribs crack. I winced in pain before he hit me in my shoulder, only missing my head by a few inches. I was on the ground, barely lucid, before the police finally showed up and grabbed him. They took him in the police cruiser and called an EMT for me.

They got statements from both of us. Apparently, he claimed I attacked him first, and he wants to sue me for the whole thing. We have court in the morning, but I wanted to make this public.

1nnbllu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nnbllu/my_deaf_roommate_has_been_trying_to_kill_me_since/,My Deaf Roommate has Been Trying to Kill Me Since I Moved in,"I just recently moved into an apartment with a deaf man, and ever since I moved in, he‚Äôs been acting strange. I needed a new apartment to stay in after my ex cheated on me with another man. He and I were together for six months and decided to get our own place. We were great, never got into any arguments, did chores together, and watched all kinds of shows and movies as a couple. It was only a couple of weeks in when we started arguing, always about little things, such as chores or if I mentioned a friend, especially if it was a guy. Every fight we had drifted us further apart. Until one day I came home from work and saw him and another man on the couch, completely naked. God, how I wish I had never found out. I yelled at him and ran out of the apartment crying. I went back a couple of hours later to get my stuff and leave. He didn't even try to confront me; he just sat on that filthy couch in silence.



I had to wait a few weeks for the lease to end so I could move on, sometimes sleeping in my car or at work. Then I came across an ad on Craigslist. (NEED NEW ROOMMATE: RENT $150/MONTH). I was excited and replied as fast as I could. I didn‚Äôt bother reading most of the post, just that his last roommate had moved away, and that he was deaf.



I didn‚Äôt find anything wrong with the post; the only thing I was wary about was that he was deaf. Only after I replied was I curious about how we would communicate, since I didn‚Äôt know any sign language. He was quick to respond, saying I could move in whenever I liked. I asked about the communication between us if I moved in. He assured me that I wasn‚Äôt a problem since he had notepads all around the apartment, as well as reading lips. I told him I‚Äôd be there tomorrow, and he sent me the address with a thumbs-up emoji.



The next morning, I made my way over to the man‚Äôs apartment. It was in a rough neighborhood, but I needed a place to stay, and $150 is a great deal. I went up the shaky stairs to the man‚Äôs door and knocked, only to realize that he wouldn‚Äôt hear it. I texted him I was there, and he opened up the door, like he was waiting for me. I was a bit startled when he flung the door open, but I put on a quick smile and reached to shake his hand.



‚ÄúHi! It‚Äôs nice to meet you. I‚Äôm Morgan.‚Äù



He grabbed my hand firmer than I expected and outstretched his arm to welcome me in. The inside of the apartment was very clean and tidy; a lot nicer than I expected from the outside of the building. The apartment had four rooms: one bathroom, two bedrooms, and the living room/kitchen. He follows behind me close into the apartment, so close actually that I could feel his breath on my neck. I played it off, thinking that maybe his social skills weren‚Äôt that great.¬†



He sits down at the dining table behind the couch in the living room and offers for me to sit down. I sat down across from him as he started to write on his notepad.¬†



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alone?‚Äù I was a bit puzzled by his question.



‚ÄúYes, I am. Are you sure 150 is enough? This place is really nice.‚Äù



He scribbles down on his notepad.



‚ÄúYes. Rent is $150. The landlord and I have an agreement.‚Äù



‚ÄúAh, okay. I only plan on staying for a couple of months until I can get my own place.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem. As long as you pay, you can stay for as long as you like.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you, I really appreciate it!‚Äù



He smiles and nods his head and asks if I‚Äôd like anything to eat, I declined but thanked him again for the offer.¬†



After our exchange, he showed me to my room, and I went in to unpack. The room was bare, with only a bed set up with a TV on the dresser. He stayed by the door and watched me unpack everything for 15 minutes before going into the living room. I stayed in my room most of the day to set up my room and unwind. I only heard him get up from the living room a handful of times to go into the kitchen and slam the cabinets around. Apparently, he doesn't know how loud those cabinets are; it sounded like thunder the way they echoed into my room. I went out and tapped him on the shoulder to let him know I was done and heading to bed soon. He grabbed the notepad off the couch next to him and started writing.



‚ÄúI ordered pizza online if you wanted any. Should be here soon.‚Äù



I told him, 'Sure,' and joined him on the couch, turning on the TV. The TV¬† flickered on with the biggest subtitles I‚Äôve ever seen; they took up a good half of the TV. I started flipping through channels for a while until he snatched the remote from my hand and put on reruns of ‚ÄòThe Twilight Zone‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt complain since it was his TV and I love the show anyway.¬†



Only 10 minutes go by before I hear a knock at the door. I tap him on the shoulder and tell him the pizza is here. He nods, and I get up to answer the door. I get the pizza and place it on the dining table. I tell him I have to use the bathroom first, and he gives me a thumbs up for going to the table. I come back into the living room, and he has a slice for me ready on a plate. He waves his hand towards it to have me join him. I sit and look at the slice, and it looks like he has put Parmesan on it for me already. I took a bite, and it was chalky with a slightly sour taste; I thought maybe it had expired.



We finished the meal, and I thanked him again, letting him know I was heading to bed. He grabbed his notepad and said it was his pleasure, then told me to get some sleep. I go to bed and wake up a couple of times with stomach pains. I had to keep going to the bathroom all night. Luckily, the bathroom was right across from my room. I didn‚Äôt get any sleep.



I got up in the morning and saw him at the dining table, looking out the window until he noticed me. He had a coffee waiting for me. I sit down and sip on the coffee. Then I noticed him writing

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you sleep?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot great, I think that pizza made me sick.‚Äù  
  


‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm not feeling well either.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking a sick day, I need some sleep.‚Äù



‚ÄúHope you feel better.‚Äù  
  


I said ‚ÄòYou too‚Äô before going back to bed. It was almost noon by the time I woke up again. I open my eyes to see him standing at the foot of my bed with a kitchen knife. I was terrified, but he panicked and shook his head and arms around. He grabbed his notepad from his pocket.



‚ÄúI thought I saw a mouse.‚Äù



‚ÄúCan you not do that in my room?! You gave me a heart attack!‚Äù



He apologized and left my room.¬†



After that, we didn‚Äôt interact too much, just in passing. Whenever I left for work or to get groceries, he was always home, reading. I don‚Äôt think he worked or ever left the apartment. He was always there when I was.¬†



My friend texted me asking to see my new apartment. I agreed since I hadn‚Äôt seen her in forever. She knocked, and I answered the door and greeted her. I introduced her to my new roommate, and he seemed displeased. He went to write on his notepad.



‚ÄúNice to meet you. I didn‚Äôt know we were having company.‚Äù



‚ÄúSorry, I should have asked.‚Äù He put on a fake smile.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm heading to my room.‚Äù

Why do stimulants have to be so necessary? I've had experiences with everything; caffeine, nicotine, meds. Nicotine is moreso a crippling addiction I could honestly live without, and medication is a great push. But neither of those chill me out like caffeine does.

I don't know if its a placebo effect, but for a couple of months I stopped drinking caffeine due to getting mono and GI issues and I was just completely winded up. I thought it was the stress of my body that was making me so antsy, but when everything started to come down and my head was still completely all over the place, I felt so lost. I started meds around this time and while it was great to get things done, I still never felt as if anything was slowing down. It's like for a large portion of the year, I've been completely unable to take my time and appreciate things. 

But for the past week or so, I've been indulging in the occasional coffee or Pepsi Max. I was nervous because I'm already on stimulants and I've had concerns about my heartrate (nothing's actually happened, I just get nervous), but I found myself more lax than I have been in ages. I didn't even notice it fully until today; I woke up the same frantic mess as usual, went through the whole morning pacing and doing random shit, then had a Pepsi Max and all of a sudden everything feels so fine. I am completely calm. A little tired in the eyes, but my mind isn't racing and I feel like I can actually focus. I felt a similar sense of control before I quit a couple months ago and completely lost it.

Am I crazy for feeling like meds and caffeine have differing affects on me? Should I stop taking meds in favour of caffeine, or double up my dose? I already feel calm enough to quit smoking, it's so strange. I think I need caffeine in order to function, or at least have a clear head. But I'm probably putting my heart through so much stress.

1nnbktc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnbktc,"Dream Glow Slime, a review by Mike Dearth","Here we go, it's finally happening. Thanks for your patience, things happen and I was busy for a while and I wanted more time to give attention to detail in a way I feel I should give to every shop. I used to roast coffee and ""cup"" it (basically take a small spoonful and aspirate it in your tongue by quickly and sharply sucking the coffee up, it really helps to notice all the flavor profiles as coffee is the most complex beverage on Earth) so I have a little understanding about how to review. Thanks again, please remember my experience with slime is very limited so I don't know all the things about it but I want to! Here we go:

1. When you realize:

Texture: crushed silica + coated clear
Color: opaque pink with a gold(ish)/copper(ish)/bronze(ish) glitter
Scent: inspired by Phlur father figure (green figure orris, musk, sandalwood. 
Experience level: advanced 
Size: 7 oz
They did mention in the notes that the slime is discounted because of fallout when played with especially when ripped or inflated. 

The slime is nice and cooling when you take it out of the container, which was a really nice experience for me, although that may be a common occurrence with all slimes, I don't really know. It is a thicker coated slime so it wasn't tacky or anything and so it wasn't as runny or gooey as a lot of clear slimes can be, really easy to play with one hand. Now for the crushed silica, before I mixed the slime all together I turned it over to see the silica and it was iridescent in color and looked like a crushed crystal so that was really pretty and an accurate description! The slime when mixed, stretched, and inflated makes little bubble pops here and there, I would describe it as a nice stretchy slime that doesn't rip if you decide to play aggressively. The silica adds a nice slightly gritty texture as the slime has approximately an inch thick layer of the silica. As far as the scent goes, I don't agree with the description but it does smell like a nice light fragrance you'd find in Abercrombie and Fitch or Banana Republic. I'd recommend this slime to anyone who likes a coated clear that doesn't have an overwhelming amount of gritty texture and doesn't want an overwhelming fragrance. 


2. Late night phone calls

Texture: Jiggly water jelly 
Color: Purple with purple glitter and a blue glitter ""underneath"" if that makes sense 
Scent: gumdrops, sugared lemon, musk
Experience level: advanced 
Size: 7 oz
They noted that it is made with Korean glue

This slime was also cool to the touch and it feels like a really gooey coated clear as it had zero tackiness. I want to talk about the color, but I'd like to give a short preamble about it. When I first got into slimes, I bought ultraviolet from Slime Obsidian (I know, boooo, hisssssss) and that's what really turned me into slimes because that color just blew my mind, man the things people can do with slime just blow my mind! Chemistry is an amazing science and I wish I paid more attention in school. Anyways, this slimes coloration blows ultraviolet out of the water because of how skillfully it was made. To me, it honestly seems like a two-toned color in how the purple with purple glitter seems to always stay ""on top"" of the blue glitter (the glitter confused me because I thought it was blue colored slime not purple slime with blue glitter!) so, in my opinion, I think this is the best colored slime I have yet to experience. It is a more slow stretch slime as I felt like the polymers were straining against me stretching it anymore quickly. It makes nice pops when stretched, inflated, and then squeezed. To me it is definitely a two hander that you don't want to play with over anything but a clean, hard surface because of how runny it is, not like water in your hands but closer to an egg white if I can say so. Like 'when you realize' I definitely don't get those fragrance notes but it does smell like a nice shampoo. I wouldn't recommend this for kids or anyone inexperienced with slimes in general but I would recommend it for people who love color and a thinner coated clear. 

3. Central Park 

Texture: K-glue snow fizz 
Color: orange like an orange peel
Scent: fall breeze (fresh autumn breeze, amber woods, red currant, crisp apple, phone needles.)
Experience level: intermediate 
Size:7 oz
They described it as a crunchy, fizzy Korean glue snow fizz that feels like a coated slime. I thought that they all have that coated feel. 

I saved this one for last because, and I say this honestly, this has to be my second favorite slime of all time m, a little underneath a ground pumice or fine sand slime. This slime had a slight tackiness to it but as I played with it, it went away so I might have been imagining it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It's a nice thick slime packed with snow fizz and as it's played with it gets nice, light, and airy - it's seriously something to be experienced by anyone who likes slime. The description that kept coming to the forefront of my mind was ""plump"",  I don't really know how else to say it, it just feels like a plump slime. I rolled it into a ball after playing with it a bit and it held its shape, I imagine that's because of the snow fizz giving it structure. Again, the scent descriptions they use aren't what I would describe them as, I would say it has the scent of a nice autumnal candle from a good candle shop, nice and light and very pleasant. I would recommend this slime to anyone who loves a textured slime that's nice on the hands and really fun to just mindlessly stretch, inflate, and squeeze as it's crunchy and sizzly!


I really hope this was an enjoyable experience and that I didn't annoy too many of you (hopefully none). Please feel free to give me pointers on what you'd like to see in future reviews, or if you even want anymore which wouldn't hurt my feelings, I'm just glad to be a part of this great community of people. Thanks for the encouragement to do this, I really feel like I'm beginning to really understand that there are definite tiers of slime and just because a slime appear to be top tier on Facebook or YouTube it doesn't mean that it is. Also, I'm gonna need to have a lot of self control because I want to buy all the nice slimes from all the nice slime shops. One more thing, let me know which slimes I should review next: Rodem, Slime Sweet Pea, Slime Fantasies, Momo, and coming in the mail to my house hopefully soon - Soft Punk Slime.

I never wanted to fall in love, I didn't even want to like you. But somehow you got under my skin.

I thought I could play off these feelings as me being starved for affection, years of neglect and abuse, a childhood filled with anxiety and sadness. But really you were easy to love. You have this amazing presence and calm about you.

I couldn't give you me without giving you more, without giving you all of it. Wanted or not. I gave it still. And now, I just cry at the most crazy random parts of my day. Over coffee, in the car driving to work, before I go to sleep, in the shower. I just cry. An overwhelming presence and deep sadness that grips my chest.

I hate who I've become. I don't recognise the woman in the mirror. I wish I didn't have this need to be close to anyone, to be wanted or needed in this way. I wish I didn't have this unreasonable need for closure from you.

You affected me in the loveliest and the most horrendous ways.

I feel the depression creeping in, I know this presence, it's been here before. It has a home here, a reserved space. I don't want this nor do I need this.

We could have been friends. You, a real proper friend. I would have prefered a friend to what has been left. A void. A nothing. A pain. A hurt.

But you'll never know this, because you don't care.

So here, this, this is my closure.

We both agreed once we know this was solid we would meet then as we are both in two different lifestyles according to him. 

Well the start was great, good chemistry and exploring but then I introduced him to my circle of friends. From that night I saw a lot of hostility in regard to my male friends(never slept with any of them). The fact I talk to them or talk about them but yet in the other breath says that he doesn‚Äôt mind. A lot of double standards especially as he had coffee till 8.30pm with a past friend he was intermit with (just to disclose I did not have a problem with that once we had a chat).
To then go on two days after this he makes comment on me having my phone face down (I do that around people the be polite and not be distracted and immediately rectified the problem once I notice it because he does not like it) he then made comment on if I feel uncomfortable going on social media around him which for me i replied with a no. Then fast forward 2 hours we are looking at reels on my phone and I said I thought i sent one to a friend  in which there was a short banter convo where my mate said I hate you and my reply was love you. Not it a way that means I love you it a f you response really. This set this person off. Talking about boundaries morals and that he doesn‚Äôt believe I should talk like that to anyone else but him.

Thousands of karma. Lots of interaction discussing hobbies, desiring friendship and trying to relate to different communities. I'm a housewife, I'm Black, I'm a gamer, I love fashion, my wife is a professor, I love animals and anime and art and music.. I've made an effort to share who I am and connect with people in so many ways virtually and it doesn't work. 

There's this plague of small talk that can never be purged. Hesitancy to have real conversation - like they'd rather be doing something else than getting to know me. I *get* that if you're in your mid 20s like me you also struggled to learn how to socialize because our adulthood started in the pandemic. We got used to seclusion. Then the world began to further fall apart when the mandate was lifted. Now everyone is wary of each other.. when I just want to sit with coffee or a show amd yap about small fun things. Future plans. A restaurant you want to try. Happiness and politics. Family and life.

Why is it so hard? I'm a nice person.. I dont think I'm such a nuisance or eyesore that I'm unlikable. I try my best to be selfless and not always talk about myself. Or burden others with my baggage. I try so fucking hard to hope that one day I'll meet people who care enough to actually talk to me. I'm 26... I'm terrified of hitting 30 and being just as alone as I am now. It's **not enough that I'm married.** The codependency is overwhelming when your spouse is the only true human interaction you get for months at a time. I'm so tired of trying. Of being ignored.

Am I overthinking and focusing too much on the negatives or are my feelings valid and I‚Äôm being gaslight into thinking it‚Äôs okay?,"[tl;dr] - relationship of 2.5 years started going downhill after moving in together 1 year ago. Boyfriend is never around, never does his share for our household and chores, doesn‚Äôt ask me about myself or day or week. Always on his phone. I tell him it‚Äôs bothering me and I feel alone and want him to participate in this relationship more and he tells me that it‚Äôs all because of me and being negative and only focusing on the problems and what he doesn‚Äôt do. That he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me because there isn‚Äôt anything to talk about. Am I actually overreacting and only focusing on negatives and asking too much of him or am I valid in feeling alone in this relationship? 




I [25F] have been in a relationship with my boyfriend [28M] for 2.5 years. At first it seemed really great and like I found my person. He put effort in and always made me feel heard and seen and loved. 
But since moving in with him 1 year ago, it feels like the relationship has taken a turn for the worse. I‚Äôve been living with one foot in and one foot out for months now unsure about how I‚Äôm feeling and if I‚Äôm being delusional or too hung up on the negatives or not. Which is why I‚Äôm having a hard time deciding if I should keep trying to make it work and solve the issues with him or leave and save myself the trouble. 


I‚Äôll try to make this long list/story somewhat short and to the point. 

Before I moved in I made it very clear that I will not become the housekeeper/maid/cook/personal shopper etc and that if I‚Äôm moving in I want it to be a true partnership within the home and relationship. I grew up in a home like that and vowed to never put myself in that position because that‚Äôs not what i want for my life or relationship 

It was okay for the first month or so but then it turned into feeling like I‚Äôm a)the only person even living here and b)the only person even in the relationship.

I would come home from work and cook dinner and clean up the house a bit. Every-time it would be trash or dishes that he would leave wherever he sat. It started becoming my responsibility to do the general laundry (towels, bedding, blankets etc) because he just wouldn‚Äôt do it. Then it turned into me being the only one doing the grocery run and getting the household supplies (toilet paper, paper towel, soap, dishwasher pods) and given yes he pays for half of the bill but will never actually go do it for us himself if I‚Äôm busy with work. He won‚Äôt clean unless I tell him and even then he‚Äôll only clean his stuff and his area and do a few swipes of the vacuum and that‚Äôs his clean. He won‚Äôt take the trash out or empty the recycling, he won‚Äôt put the laundry in the bin or pull out stuff for dinner even if I ask him to. He won‚Äôt cook dinner cause he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know what to make or how‚Äù even though he was capable of this before I moved in‚Ä¶.

So I addressed it with him, I said I felt really alone in the relationship because I work the same amount he was and yet was still the only one keeping up with the household share of duties plus some since he just wouldn‚Äôt do it. I also said it sucks when I‚Äôm literally at work come home to an empty messy home go to bed alone and do that consistently because he‚Äôs always ‚Äúdoing stuff‚Äù. 
He told me that he does do it and I‚Äôm being dramatic in saying he doesn‚Äôt help with anything. He said he cleans and he doesn‚Äôt cook because I just do it and doesn‚Äôt do the dishes because I just do it and etc etc same response to every task ‚Ä¶. Because I just do it and don‚Äôt give him enough time to do it. 

At first I was like okay well then I will leave it for you to do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure you can guess where this is going. 

I would ask him to unload the dishwasher on his day off when I‚Äôm working. But he wouldn‚Äôt do it because he forgot or ‚ÄúI was going to do it‚Äù even though he had all day to and it‚Äôs now 8pm and it‚Äôs still not done.

This grew into the reasoning for everything that I just didn‚Äôt give him enough time or he forgot or he was going to do it. 

Anytime he had a day off he would wake up leave the house and not come back till 9-10-11pm and the tasks that he said he would do never get done. He goes golfing, he goes skateboarding, he drives around on his e-bike with friends he smokes a bunch of weed and fucks around idek but it always comes first before doing anything for our home. And this is an every night thing. The only time he‚Äôs ever actually at home is when none of his friends can hang out with him and he has nothing else to do. But then he still doesn‚Äôt do anything for us  or the household. 

I ask him how his day is and what he did, how golf was where he went etc etc I take him coffee to work sometimes when I‚Äôm able to as a surprise I make dinner, I plan dates I do a lot. He doesn‚Äôt reciprocate and can barely even hold a conversation. All his responses are close ended and one word, he doesn‚Äôt return the question of how was your day or how was work. He told me that this isn‚Äôt something he feels like he should have to do because we already live together and it doesn‚Äôt matter much.  It‚Äôs literally like pulling teeth out with pliers trying to get any resemblance of a conversation going with him that‚Äôs not about him. He literally does not ask me a single thing about myself. 

So I brought it up again and I got the exact same response. The cycle continued for another month so I brought it up again this addressing that I‚Äôm also sick of him only wanting to hang out with me when there is literally no other options for him that day/evening. He also picked up the great habit of coming home in the evening and just going on his phone till he falls asleep. Completely ignorant to me talking to him or sitting next to him he‚Äôs that absorbed into his phone. So when I told him all of this He continued saying I‚Äôm being dramatic and always focused on the negative and never am positive and uplifting and supporting him. 
He also said that he ‚Äúlikes to be busy‚Äù and that if I can‚Äôt accept him for that then I should leave. And him going on his phone helps him unwind and that he thinks it‚Äôs important to be able to be in each others presence without always having to talk. 

I told him I understand but being busy doesn‚Äôt equate to neglecting the relationship, me his partner, and anything to do with the household and chores. 

This continued through this summer and now it‚Äôs September and i recently got back into school for my medical program that is an incredibly demanding and busy program. It comes with a lot for studying and being at classes.

Starting off September He went away on a trip with his friends and when he got back he didn‚Äôt ask me a single thing about my week didn‚Äôt ask me how my first day of classes was or if I‚Äôm excited. If I met any new friends, what I did over the week while he was gone literally not a single thing. I literally picked him up from the airport and once I got out the few one word responses to me asking him about his trip it was silent. He couldn‚Äôt come up with a single thing to say and then once we got home he just went on his phone and went to bed. 

So I decided to pull back on a lot of what I‚Äôve been doing around the house and decided to wait and see if he would pick up the slack or offer to help or literally anything to show he actually wanted to be a participating partner in our home and relationship. I stopped initiating conversations stopped asking him about his day literally everything to see if he even noticed or cared or decided to start initiating it.

Literally radio silence. The other day he knew I was home all day doing the online classes and that they are from 8am-5 pm and that I don‚Äôt have a break between any of them to even make food. He came home after work at 5 picked himself up some supper didn‚Äôt text me to see if I wanted anything or if I was hungry or if I‚Äôd want to go out for dinner after my classes literally nothing. Came home said hi went on his phone while he ate his dinner he got only for himself then got up went to bed and continued watching his phone. The next night same thing happened only this time he broke a glass and then got mad at me because I stacked the dishes in the drying rack badly and that‚Äôs why it broke. Even though it was sat there all day and night with no prior issue. And somehow that was mine to clean up he literally didn‚Äôt even bother to try to help pick up all the glass. Just stared at me like a toddler and then went to the bedroom to go on his phone. 

This has been the exact same pattern. I asked him one morning if he could grab me a coffee on his way back from getting an oil change since I was at home studying and he told me ‚Äúmaybe but only if it‚Äôs a convenient stop‚Äù I said okay but we literally live down the road from 15 coffee shops so like??? And what did he do not get me anything instead came home with his own then grabbed his golf stuff and left again. Texted me after golf asking what I was making for dinner and if I wasn‚Äôt making anything to let him know so he could stop for himself. 

Then I accidentally had socks mixed in with his laundry and after he finished doing his laundry instead of setting my stuff on my dresser so I could put it away he just threw it all on the ground on my side of our bed.

And there is so so much more but this will become wayyyy to long if I keep going. The general consensus of it though is although this sounds pretty cut and dry I‚Äôm very confused.

He keeps telling me that I‚Äôm overreacting and being negative and unhappy and making problems out of no where and always telling him how bad of a job he‚Äôs doing and that I‚Äôm approaching these things wrong when I have an issue - literally like he wants me to gentle parent him. He says that I‚Äôm calling him the worst boyfriend ever etc etc and then he ends up pouting until I apologize for getting upset with him and we return to the same cycle. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm in a gas lit room with honestly what I am starting to feel like is a narcissist that refuses to do anything unless it benefits him. The relationship is good enough to him because he‚Äôs happy because he has zero responsibilities and does whatever he wants in every second of free time while I am picking up the slack of everything he just will not do. 

So I guess my reason for posting‚Ä¶. Is are all these things truly just negatives and overreactions or are they valid feelings and frustrations that are being blatantly ignored by my partner?

Aria's POV



I stood in front of the chapel.



Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.



The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.



Everything was perfect.



Except I wasn't the bride.



‚ÄúI really need to see Jace today.‚Äù



I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.



""No you don‚Äôt. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.



I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.



But I have my reason to be here.



""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.



Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.



Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.



She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.



All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.



So he made the easy call‚Äîmarrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.



He didn‚Äôt want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.



Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.



‚ÄúLet me in or I‚Äôm starting to yell.‚Äù I choked.



The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""



He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.



I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.



Instantly, I felt out of place.



Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.



And me?



I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.



""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.



No it couldn‚Äôt be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.



But poverty had a scent, apparently.



""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, ‚ÄúMake it quick.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù



The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.



And there he was.



The man I used to love.



Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.



Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.



When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.



""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.



And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.



Hey, Jace?!



That‚Äôs the best I could do?



His face was ice cold.



""You shouldn't come, Aria.‚Äù he said with a frown. ‚ÄúYour ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""



Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done.



""Don‚Äôt you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.



He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I‚Äôm wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""



Wow.



I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.



I just didn‚Äôt realize how deep it ran.



""Maybe chasing Alpha‚Äôs sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You‚Äôll lose it all.""



Anger flared across his face.



""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.‚Äù he said freezingly, ‚ÄúAre we done here?""



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.



""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""



Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.



From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.



Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO‚Äôs sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.



""Right, your job.‚Äù The jerk shrugged, ‚ÄúYou got your job all thanks to me. Now that I‚Äôm not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""



Was he fucking kidding me?!



""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.



‚ÄúCome on, Aria. You really gonna be so na√Øve?‚Äù



He walked closer, smirking.



""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""



He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.



""Give me my job back,‚Äù I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. ‚ÄúMy dad‚Äôs debt. My grandma‚Äôs medical bills‚Ä¶I need the money. You of all people should know what it‚Äôs like to be poor. Don‚Äôt. Make. Me. Beg.""



I was throwing my pride at his feet.



But he just laughed.



""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he‚Äôd been waiting for this moment.



He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.



""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I‚Äôll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""



I widened my eyes in shock.



Then I slapped him. HARD.



‚ÄúFUCKING HELL‚Ä¶What the hell are you doing?! I‚Äôm getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!‚Äù He roared covering his swollen face.



""Fuck you, Jace!‚Äù I yelled, ‚ÄúYou're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey‚Äîcongrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""



Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.



Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.



God this couldn‚Äôt be any worse.



I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.



But I still let him get to me.



Now what do I do?



My salary barely covered my rent, my father‚Äôs debt and grandma‚Äôs bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.



So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I‚Äôd rather die than that‚Ä¶



""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.



Too late.



I slammed right into the man in front of me.



He was tall. So tall I felt like I‚Äôd just walked into a brick wall.



His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.



In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.



‚ÄúAh!‚Äù I gasped and looked up.



This was the most handsome man I‚Äôd ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.



When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.



Suddenly, I recognized who he was.



This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.



Jace‚Äôs brother-in-law.



THE legendary. Grayson Hart.



‚ÄúAria Collins?‚Äù



His voice was sexy and velvety.



He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.



Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.



But wait.



How did he know my name?



Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria‚Äôs POV



Of course I recognized him. God, who didn‚Äôt?



I‚Äôd met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was‚Äîlinked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.



But there was no way he‚Äôd know who I was.



‚ÄúI-I‚Ä¶Hello, Alpha Grayson,‚Äù I stammered.



He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, ‚ÄúEscort Ms. Collins out.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Alpha.‚Äù



The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson‚Äôs perfectly tailored suit.



‚ÄúWait a minute. You‚Äôre not going to say something about my shirt?‚Äù It‚Äôs torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.



He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.



I looked down. A blank check.



‚ÄúI need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.‚Äù I gritted with humiliation.



But he didn‚Äôt even glance back and just walked away.



‚ÄúGod,‚Äù I muttered under my breath.



Can you believe these rich bastards?



They think they can buy everything with money.



People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.



‚ÄúOh my god‚Ä¶Aria Collins?‚Äù



Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.



Great. Just when I thought today couldn‚Äôt get any worse.



‚ÄúHello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.‚Äù I said dryly.



I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.



These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.



After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.



‚ÄúWhat are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That‚Äôs a new low even for you,‚Äù Layla snickered.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to win anyone back.‚Äù I tried to push past them.



But they blocked me.



‚ÄúWhat happened to your shirt?‚Äù Brielle snickered. ‚ÄúDid you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?‚Äù



They burst into laughter together.



‚ÄúYou could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn‚Äôt give a damn,‚Äù Sabrina squeaked. ‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôs marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack‚Äôs sweetheart. And you‚Ä¶well you‚Äôre just a poor-ass small-town girl.‚Äù



I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.‚Äù



Their jaws dropped.



‚ÄúJace would never say that!‚Äù Brielle cried.



‚ÄúAnd my perfume isn‚Äôt cheesy!‚Äù Sabrina screamed.



‚ÄúWord for word,‚Äù I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúNow move. Or I‚Äôm rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.‚Äù



They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.



Rich people were assholes.



Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.



I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.



It‚Äôs almost night. But I had no idea where to go.



I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she‚Äôd ask too many questions. Like why I hadn‚Äôt brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn‚Äôt staying at my apartment. I didn‚Äôt want her to know how bad things had gotten.



I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.



So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.



She texted back right away inviting me to come over.



Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.



Then I heard them.



‚ÄúHey, nice shirt!‚Äù



A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.



I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they‚Äôd get bored and leave.



‚ÄúC‚Äômon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you‚Äôre working with.‚Äù



Go away. Go away. Go away.



‚ÄúYou rip that shirt yourself? Damn that‚Äôs wild. I like that in a girl.‚Äù One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.



‚ÄúFuck off!‚Äù I snapped, my voice shaking.



But it only fired them up.



‚ÄúOh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!‚Äù

1nnb6o7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnb6o7,AITAH for telling my friends first before confronting the other friend?,"One of my friends (19 M), we can call him Jay, and I (23 F) have been arguing about a situation that has two sides. This one‚Äôs going to be a doozy and I apologize for how long this might be. Jay and I became friends exactly 31 days ago. I haven‚Äôt known Jay for very long. Over the past couple weeks hanging out I have brought him around my close friend group. Let‚Äôs name them Sam (26 M), Tom (23 M) and Kris (22 M). I had some incidents with Kris before, making me think that he really does not like woman and he takes it out on me since I‚Äôm the only girl in the group. He always tried to throw insults at me but I would always shut them down. I‚Äôve always been honest and there for him from day one. 

When me and Jay had our first interaction in person, we talked about our past relationships. He mentioned leaving his ex because she cheated on him multiple times, he became controlling, and didn‚Äôt like who he was becoming. I didn‚Äôt ask for many details and Jay never said anything further about what he meant. Jay said that he needs focus on growing as a person after all that trauma. So who is this girl? Jay told me that June(19 F) is his ex. Which to mine and his surprise, is my cousin. He said he didn‚Äôt know that we were related. My close friends always had a weird feeling about Jay from the start. Over time I started to see things in Jays behavior that made me uncomfortable. I did some more digging to find out if I‚Äôm the only one who feels this way. 

I‚Äôm typically someone who doesn‚Äôt keep things behind people‚Äôs backs and like to talk things out. People who know me, know this about me as I do it often. After thinking and talking to my close friends about it. I wrote a letter to Jay expressing how me and the others feel. 
To sum up my letter that I wrote to jay I said:
 ‚ÄúI need to be honest about how I‚Äôve been feeling. Some of your comments come across as disrespectful or hypocritical, and they‚Äôve started making people uncomfortable‚Äîwe can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre joking or serious. You often dismiss others, instead of listening, and it makes me not want to open up anymore. At times, you act differently than what you preach, and it feels like you‚Äôre creating an image that isn‚Äôt real. Others in the group have also noticed this behavior and it‚Äôs caused tension. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to keep bringing you around.‚Äù 

I then sent it to him. He nick-picked the paragraph without reading it all. Jay wanted to know who exactly have been saying these things about him. I told Jay ‚ÄúAll of that and you‚Äôre more interested in who said what instead of how I and others felt? Someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs more interested about who‚Äôs saying things is someone who‚Äôs not willing to work on themselves.‚Äù Jay then said he‚Äôs too busy to craft a response and he will talk to me later. We left it at that and the day goes on without me hearing anything from Jay. 

Later that night, I was hanging out with my close friends. We decided to stop at a gas station and saw that Jay was there. We hung out there for some time away from Jay, then quickly headed out after our coffee. I see Jay is talking to two others that I‚Äôm not fairly close with. I got home and still havnt heard anything from Jay. 

As I‚Äôm getting ready for bed, my mom comes into my room and warned me about Jay. I‚Äôve only spoken about Jay once to my mom. Then never again afterwards. My mom came home from hanging out with Junes family. Mom then asked me if I hang out with Jay. I said sometimes. She told me it‚Äôs probably best to not bring Jay around. That June was in an abusive relationship with him. He tried to control her about what she wears upon other things. Jay once pushed her into a wall while arguing. That Jay has done a lot of bad things, with June and her mom calling him a psychopath and a stalker. June and her family moved away because Junes mother didn‚Äôt want Jay finding out where they live and have a restraining order against Jay. Also Jay knew the entire time that I am Junes cousin. 

I was shocked. I then quickly went to the gc with my close friends being in the chat. No jay. I told them what just happened, I started ranting on about every detail about my experience. Tom then stated that he knew something was off about Jay from the beginning. With Sam backing him up. Tom then proceeded to say Jay was acting creepy recently and asking what Im gunna do now. I saw Kris popping in and out of the gc but saying nothing. I told them, I‚Äôm not sure but there‚Äôs always two sides of the story. Sam then said ‚ÄúAbuse and stalking is all i need to hear to be weary of him‚Äù I told Sam, ‚Äúonly if this is all true. We don‚Äôt know that for sure.‚Äù 

Seconds later while still in talking in the gc, Tom and I receive a text from Jay asking who‚Äôs talking bad about him. The only person who was in the gc that would tell Jay what‚Äôs going on, is I assumed Kris. I confronted Kris and he admitted to telling Jay the conversation we were having. Telling me that I‚Äôm talking bad about Jay. I told him I simply was not talking bad intentionally, I was talking about what happened. I wanted to get some advice from my close friends. I didn‚Äôt think Kris would immediately turn his back on me. I was going to confront Jay once I get more of a clear response crafted but Kris ran to Jay before we finished the conversation in the gc. I didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to talk to Jay yet. At this point the rest of the group are upset at Kris and Jay. I then got a call from Kris with Jay connected to the call. Accusing me of spreading lies, that ‚Äúrunning my mouth to the group before talking to Jay was a shitty thing to do.‚Äù I told them I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with wanting to talk to them about it first before I say anything to Jay. I was looking for support. 
They then continued to tell me that I‚Äôm being fake, that I‚Äôm spreading false info, that June and her mother don‚Äôt like me and they are really bad people. 

Jay was tracking everybody that ‚Äúmight be involved in the gc‚Äù that night we ran into him at the gas station. Confronting people if they ever talked bad about him. Not knowing the gc is only just me and my close friends. Which I reminded him who was in the chat. I told Kris again I thought I could trust him. That I was going to talk to Jay but Kris beat me to it. I never said any of this was 100% true. They continued to talk over me to a point where I couldn‚Äôt get a word in at all. After hearing them belittle me, disrespect me and my family, I snapped. 

This is where I might have been the a hole. I told them ‚Äúplease shut the f*ck up and listen to me! You‚Äôre not letting me talk at all, where was I?‚Äù Kris then said ‚Äúokay I‚Äôm done‚Äù then ended the call. I told both of them ‚Äúdo not expect me to respect you after disrespecting me.‚Äù 

It sounds like Jay is trying his best to cover up some things. With Kris being oblivious. Jay never said he didn‚Äôt abuse, stalk or did any of these bad things to June. Jay blew up at the fact that there was false info of a restraining order and that ‚Äúnothings true‚Äù. I had enough, I messaged Junes mom myself. She said ‚Äúeverything is true but no restraining order at the moment but I said I will put a restraining order on him if he continues to act the way he was since the reasonings will be justified in court. He honestly is a bad guy, I wouldn‚Äôt let him get in your group‚Äù. 
So my mom misheard Junes mom. Thinking they already had it against him. I want to apologize to Jay and tell him that the restraining order is a misunderstanding but I don‚Äôt know if I should. Kris and Jay think I‚Äôm the ahole for telling, what I thought were my close friends, about the whole incident with what my mom said before talking to Jay first.

I vacationed here as a kid and it‚Äôs always stuck with me, so now that I‚Äôm retired it feels like the right time to come back.

My biggest non-negotiable is reliable high-speed internet. Cable at the very least, but ideally fiber. I know broadband coverage can vary by exact address, and I‚Äôd really like to hear which towns or neighborhoods have internet that actually stays up when a winter storm rolls through. Close behind that on my worry list is healthcare. I saw a post here from someone who languished trying to get help for their knee and finally went to MA to get diagnosed. I‚Äôm used to Boston-area access, where you can see a specialist or get diagnostics in days, not months. I don‚Äôt have big health needs right now, but I know that will matter more as I get older. For context, I currently pay about $1,400 a year for a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO plan in Massachusetts and I‚Äôd love to know what kind of experience people in Vermont have with availability and insurance options.

I‚Äôm leaning toward southern Vermont so I can stay within easy reach of my Massachusetts family.  Manchester or Dover have caught my eye but I‚Äôm open to anywhere that fits the bill. 

I‚Äôd like to be close enough to at least a supermarket and a handful of restaurants or shops. I‚Äôm not expecting the walkable convenience I have now in suburban Massachusetts, where I can stroll to coffee shops and grocery stores, but I‚Äôd rather not drive an hour just to pick up groceries.

One thing that surprised me as I‚Äôve been reading posts here is the talk of traffic issues. Coming from Massachusetts that almost sounds funny, but I get that ski season, leaf-peeper weekends, and harsher winters can create their own headaches on the roads. And of course I‚Äôm curious about the other realities of living here year-round: how people handle snow removal and heating costs, what property taxes are like from town to town, and any of those little day-to-day details that only locals really know.

Like on the snow removal front I assume I can pay someone to plow the driveway. Though I‚Äôve noticed paved driveways are not the norm, can those be plowed?

I currently live in a condo so I haven‚Äôt had to deal with snow removal‚Ä¶.. ever, well with the exception of digging out. 

If you‚Äôve made a similar move, or if you just have some lived-in Vermont wisdom I‚Äôd really appreciate your perspective.

1nnawl8,https://i.redd.it/5qy8u6jjomqf1.png,No Longer Be Your Luna  ‚Äì Watching him make a fool of himself with another woman on stage ‚Äì Full Novel Collection | Direct Access (First Comment Link),"Chapter 1:

\*Jane\*

I didn't expect to spend my thirtieth birthday like this‚Ä¶ at a party my Alpha mate had thrown ‚Äòfor me', watching him make a fool of himself with another woman on stage.

I clutched a glass of champagne tightly in my hand and my wolf growled to rip that bitch apart. Xander's shirt was half unbuttoned now, his tie long gone, and his cheeks were flushed from drinking too much whiskey. While his Beta Mia shamelessly wrapped her arm around his waist, her slender fingers dancing across his back. They sang together even if their voice was terrible.

She was younger than me, she wore a tight, low-cut dress. The red fabric clung to every curve of her body, the neckline plunging dangerously low. Her blonde hair flowed down her back, teasing my husband's skin every time they made physical contact.

Since three years ago, Mia replace her dead father as Xander's current beta and personal assistant,I watched their professional relationship gradually evolve into something. Little touches escalated into literal groping, small laughs escalated into inside jokes, and late nights at the office discussing ‚Äòpack business' for some reason now required expensive champagne and takeout.

I looked around at the ‚ÄòHappy Birthday to My Luna' balloons decorating the room, how ironic.

Mia leaned against Xander, whispering something in his ear that made he threw his head back in laughter. He looked at her as if she was the funniest person.

I hadn't seen him this happy for a long time.

The last time was seven years ago at our mating ceremony, at that time, the light in his eyes only shining for me.

People around were all laughing but I knew they were actually mocking me. The pack Luna, sitting here while her Alpha pratically groped his Beta in front of everyone.

""Five bucks says Alpha Xander and Beta Mia will kiss before midnight,"" I heard a female voice said.

""Please,"" another one responded. ""They'll do more than just kiss. Have you seen the way he's looking at her?""

I turned around slowly to look at the people speaking, making sure to calm my features. It was two young members who had just joined our pack ‚Äì a blonde and a brunette, both looking barely old enough to drink. I wasn't surprised, as only someone completely ignorant of the company hierarchy would say something like that in front of the Alpha's Luna.

When they finally noticed me staring, instead of showing appropriate respect, she tilted her head and arrogantly asked, ""Do you also work at Blackwood Group?""

I didn't respond. I just stared at them coldly.

Before I was about to retort words that would make them regret someone called out to me.

""Luna Jane! There you are, birthday girl!""

I knew who it was even before I turned. Gamma's daughter Giana. With a champagne flute in hand, her red lips stretched into what most would believe to be a friendly smile. But I knew better.

We all worked for the Blackwood Group, the world leading luxury jewelry company. It was part of being in the pack. Xander was of course as CEO and Alpha, Mia was his devoted beta and ‚Äòindispensable' executive assistance, and Giana was the sales director. Her post was right below me, so she was one of the few people who called me by my name like a friend, even though we weren't friends.

""Giana,"" I nodded at her, as she stopped in front of me.

She air-kissed both of my cheeks, her expensive perfume practically choking me. ""Happy birthday! You have to tell me how it feels to be thirty.""

Don't worry, you'll find out soon, I wanted to say. But instead, I offered a fake smile.

""You know,"" she continued, ""Everyone has been asking about you all night. ‚ÄòWhere's Luna?' ‚ÄòWhen do we get to speak with our Luna?'""

""Is that so?""

""Yes,"" she nodded, ""But it's so difficult for you to get any time with them. No opportunity to chat.""

Her eyes drifted to the stage, and Xander and Mia swayed together, sharing microphones and laughing like they were on a private date rather than a work event.

""By the way,"" Giana began. She dropped her head as if she were telling me a secret. ""What did you think about their performance? The Alpha and Beta have such‚Ä¶ chemistry on stage, don't they?""

Damn bitch. She was mocking me.

Still, I managed a forced smile at Giana. ""That's great. I'm very happy with the surprise my husband prepared for me.""

Before she spit another vicious words, the guests erupted into applause around us for the performance of their Alpha and Beta. I guessed they were done with their nonsense.

But Xander brought the damn microphone back to his lips. ""Thank you, everyone. We're having such a great time that we're going to sing one more song. In honor of my Luna"" He said the last part and points at me.

More applause. More cheers. But I smiled stiffly. All I wanted to go home, and forget about this damn birthday.

Giana looked at me with pity. ""Well, ""she said. ""I'll catch up with you later."" She hurried off.

""Oh shit, she's Luna Jane? No way""

The two blond girls whisper again from behind me.

I turn again and glare at them the last time. They both awkwardly avert their gaze and quietly walk away.

Good.

I turned back to the stage, my heart pounding. The chords of Taylor Swift's ‚ÄòLove Story' began to play.

Mia's eyes locked with Xander's, and her hand was touching his arm, making my stomach twist. She was completely shameless, and he was too drunk to notice‚Äîor worse, he didn't care. I watched Mia's fingers leave my husband's arm, trailing lower and lower, and lower.

I finally snapped.

I let the empty champagne flute crash to the floor as I walked toward the stage. I could sense all eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realized what's happening. They were waiting to see if I would break down, if the nominal Luna would finally drop the mask and accept Mia's humiliation.

But I didn't care. I was done playing the perfect Luna.

Xander didn't even look up when I stopped in front of them. Mia locked gazes with me, but instead of moving away from my husband, she simply straightened up, one hand still resting possessively on his thigh.

""Xander,"" I hissed. ""It's getting late. We should leave.""

He finally looked up, blinking in confusion.

""Leave?"" he slurred the words and gestured with his free hand. ""Come on, Jane. It's your birthday!""

Fuck the birthday.

""We. Are. Leaving,"" I said again. ""Now."" I repeated.

He mumbled like a baby and tries to pull me down to the floor ""Noo, Stay, Have fun with me, don't be such a wet blanket""

The annoyance was obvious in his voice. He looked at me like I was ruining the party.

I didn't say anything., walking backstage, my eyes landing on the event manager who'd been hovering near the sound booth.

""End it,"" I commanded immediately. ""Shut everything down. Now.""

He blinked at me. ""Luna Jane, the party is scheduled until‚Ä¶""

""I don't care when it's scheduled for,"" I cut him off, making him flinch. ""This is my birthday party, and I want it over. Cut the lights, stop the music. All of it.""

He nodded quickly and turned to the technicians, relaying my orders. Within seconds, the light dimmed, the music cut off mid-note and everywhere was silent.

When I walked back to center stage, all that was left was the sound of my high heels. I grabbed my husband's arm and pulled him firmly toward the edge of the stage. ""We're leaving,"" I said, loud enough for those nearby to hear.

Mia started saying something, but one look from me had her sinking back to the bench and shutting her mouth.

""Jane‚Ä¶"" Xander stuttered as he stumbled behind me. He was shocked by my sudden assertiveness, but I wouldn't engage. He was too drunk for me to argue with him.

As if he understood that I was in a sour mood, he became quiet. For once, I was the one in control.

I walked with Xander till we get to our car parked outside. Mike, our driver sees us coming and quickly rushes to open the back seat door. Then he helped me set Xander inside. I entered the passenger seat before slaming the door shut. I sighed, ""Take us home.""

Chapter 2: The Aftermath.

\*Jane\*

I couldn't sleep.

Xander was fast asleep beside me. He'd had no trouble nodding off, obviously not very concerned with the fact that he'd singlehandedly ruined my night.

I traced the sharp line of his jaw with my eyes, trying to search for evidence of his betrayal.

Just say a word, a name. That was all I want.

But there was nothing. Not even a twitch.

Of course not. Xander was extremely calculated, even in sleep. He always wanted to control everything, me included.

My eyes drifted to the dresser, where his phone kept lighting up. I looked back at Xander. Before I could convince myself not to, I reached for his cell.

It felt like I was committing a serious crime as I tapped my finger against the screen. It lit up, but Xander had taken the extra precaution by setting his notifications to private.

The only thing I could see was the sender, and all twenty-something texts‚Ä¶ and counting were coming from the same person. I peered down at the profile picture. It was a tiny, blurry picture even though it looked like Mia.

I spent the entire night spiraling, replaying that horrible birthday party in my head, wondering what was really going on between Mia and Xander.

I eventually gave up on sleep, and dragged myself to the kitchen. By 6 a.m., I'd consumed three cups of coffee.

I looked up when the smell of mints came to my nose. Xander appeared in the kitchen doorway, dark hair disheveled, rubbing his temples.

""Morning,"" he mumbled, shuffling toward the coffee pot. ""Last night was great. You good?""

Was it? I wanted to ask, but instead, I answered, ""Just tired."" I'd tried to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness still managed to slip out.

Xander paused mid-sip, his gray eyes narrowing slightly over the rim of his mug. The kitchen suddenly felt too small, and the tiny peace I'd felt here has vanished completely.

""What's wrong, Jane?"" He dropped his voice, sounding more concerned than he really was.

What's wrong? I almost laughed. I gripped my mug tighter. ""I'm. Fine.""

He frowned again and set his coffee down. ""You don't sound fine."" He reached for the coffee pot, refilled his mug and slid into the chair beside me. ""Talk to me Jane.""

I turned to look at him. My husband. He was devastatingly handsome. Xander was almost a whole foot taller than me, towering over most of the pack. His dark hair fell in tousled waves, still messy from sleep. A lifetime ago, I would have buried my fingers in the silky strands and planted a sweet kiss on his full lips.

Now when I looked into his gray eyes, it felt like I was looking at a stranger. Even the strong line of his jaw, his usual early morning stubble that used to make my knees weak did nothing to me anymore.

As he gazed at me innocently, I found myself transported back to how we'd met at the Werewolf Academy. Eighteen-year-old Xander had been leaning against the brick wall right outside the dining hall. I'd barely even noticed him as I walked past, but he'd spotted me immediately and declared, ""You're mine.""

And like every typical sixteen year old would, I laughed in his face. I'd believed he was feeding me some elaborate line, toying with my feelings. I didn't even sense any sort of partner relationship between us.

""You're lying,"" I'd told him flatly. ""You don't even know me.""

But that didn't deter him. He spent months pursuing me relentlessly. He would slip notes into my textbooks, get me coffee, escort me to and from class. He was attentive, caring‚Ä¶ just perfect.

I finally cracked and agreed to be his girlfriend. But with a condition. ""If I find my destined partner when I turn eighteen, I'm breaking up with you,"" I'd said to him. Xander grinned with so much confidence I almost took the words back. ""Agreed. But you won't want to.""

He was right. On my eighteenth birthday, when my wolf finally roared to summon her mate, I'd felt that unique sensation directed at none other than Xander. It made me the happiest person in the world.

Now, that memory tasted bitter in my mouth. It was tainted by his involvement with his Beta and how that had turned me into a laughing stock.

""You embarrassed me last night,"" I finally blurted. I set my mug down hard enough that coffee spilled over the rim. ""And what was that karaoke performance with Mia? Everyone was watching.""

His jaw tightened at the mention of her name. ""God, jane. You always do this‚Ä¶ make trouble out of nothing.""

""Nothing? You think it's nothing?""

""Do you know how many women would kill for your life?"" He gestured around our large kitchen with its marble countertops and advanced appliances. ""I've given you everything. Luna title. This house. The cars. The vacations.""

What was he even talking about?

""And it's never enough."" He ran his hands through his hair in frustration. ""It's always Mia this, Mia that. She‚Äôs my Beta. I'm tired of it Jane. So damn tired.""

This was my fault now? After everything he'd put me through?.

I glared at him for a moment. But I also knew that if I pushed further, he'd reach for his phone and call my mother. She never took my side, and thought it was my luck to marry Xander. After all, she couldn‚Äôt live without Xander‚Äôs money.

‚ÄúSo how would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?‚Äù

He sighed. ""I don't want to argue with you, Jane. Actually‚Ä¶"" he paused, straightening his shoulders. ""There's something I need to discuss with you. I've been thinking it's time.""

My stomach dropped. This was it. Xander was about to ask for a divorce. Mom was going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Paris next month.

But when Xander opened his mouth, he said, ""I think we should consider an open marriage.""

I sat still, waiting for the punchline, because it had to be a joke. But his expression remained serious. It finally dawned on me. Xander was not joking.

""Absolutely not,"" I yelled. ""Are you out of your mind?""

""I'm not asking for your opinion, Jane. I'm telling you what's going to happen.""

I couldn't believe what was happening. A divorce would have been much better than this. But I just had to know‚Ä¶ ""Why?""

He looked away before answering. ""I want a pup. It's been seven years. Blackwood couldn't be without an heir.""

My mouth flew open. Did he wake up with the sole purpose of hurting me? I knew what that statement meant. My inability to conceive had made me a failure. Eight rounds of IVF, eight times I'd put my body through hell, and eight times we'd failed.

""How dare you say that to me?"" I hissed. ""That's not my fault!""

""Jane‚Ä¶ you need to calm down.""

""The doctor always says we're both healthy."" My voice broke. ""Just the embryos are‚Ä¶ unusual.""

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault either. Maybe it‚Äôs just us together.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt believe he said that.

I reached for the buttons of my blouse, let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I was standing naked in front of him. ""I can try again."" I leaned into him, grabbed his hand and placed it over my chest. ""Does this not move you anymore?""

Xander's face hardened into something I didn't recognize.

‚ÄúJane‚Äù He snatched his hand away from me and rose to his feet. ""Put your clothes on, Jane. This isn't about sex."" He turned away from me as if the sight was distasteful and grabbed his keys from the counter.

I fumbled with my clothes. ""Where are you going?""

He didn't look back. ""Out!"" He walked away, toward the stairs.

""Wait,"" I shouted, my voice shaking.

Xander turned around, impatient. ""What?""

""Let‚Äôs do it. The open marriage.""

""Good"" He said before left.

\--

I spent the next couple of hours pacing in the kitchen, drowning myself in coffee while wild thoughts ran through my head. When the door finally opened again, I was sitting at the kitchen table, coffee mug in hand. Xander walked in first.

""Hey,"" I began. ""We should‚Ä¶"" I turned my attention back to the door at the sound of heels. Mia walked in, wearing her signature low-cut dress, wheeling a large suitcase behind her.

No.

""Jane,"" Xander said casually as if this was completely normal. ""Mia's moving in. She's my girlfriend now.""

I had always prided myself on my ability to remain calm regardless of what was going on. But for the first time in my life, I understood what it meant to want someone dead.

Chapter 3: Cast Aside.

\*Jane\*

When Mia stepped through the kitchen door, I was shocked and confused. The sight of her, grinning like this was her home. My wolf howled in outrage inside me. I couldn't believe he actually went through with this. I'd technically agreed to it, but I never truly thought he would bring her here. ""You can't be serious. Xander.""

""I'm very serious,"" he replied, taking Mia's suitcase and setting it down with a thud as if to say she was here to stay.

But she can't. I won't accept it. I moved to block the staircase. ""I'm the Luna of this pack and I won't allow it.""

They exchanged glances and simply walked around me like I was nothing more than furniture.

""I am your Alpha."" His alpha tone made me winch. ""It's my house. I provide you with a place to stay. If you don't like the arrangement, you're free to leave.""

I stood there, paralyzed to the spot. I replayed the entire morning in my head. How did things escalate so quickly?

As if they hadn't hurt me enough already, Mia turned to face me, her smile reeking of triumph. ""You'll need to move to the guest room, Jane. I'm not sharing a bed with you and Xander.""

I couldn't breathe. And what was even worse? Xander was right. I couldn't do anything about it.

I could only stand there, frozen and hollow as they disappeared into our bedroom. The door closed with a soft click that somehow felt worse than if it had slammed. I could hear them whispering and laughing, and that finally pulled me out of whatever kept me rooted in place.

I rushed through the hallway and out of the pack house, not bothering to close the door behind me. I stumbled into the garage, barely even standing on my feet.

Vitto, Xander's bodyguard, stood by the cars. His head snapped up as I walked in, eyes widening as he took in my disheveled appearance.

‚ÄúLuna, you-‚Äù

I extended my trembling hand. ""The keys. I need the Rolls-Royce.""

His brows knitted together. ""Alpha Xander didn't mention‚Ä¶""

""The keys, Vitto,"" I commanded, adding more force to my voice. ""Now.""

He hesitated for a bit before retrieving them from the lockbox and handing it to me. I pulled it from his grasp and jumped into the car. Vitto's worried expression in my rearview mirror was the last thing I saw before reversing out of the garage.

I drove without destination for over an hour, mind spinning. All I could see was Xander and that bitch.

I'd planned to get a manicure today. I could firmly say that I was no longer in the mood. I couldn't help but wonder how long he'd been planning this. He'd mentioned open marriage just a couple of hours ago and now he'd actually brought his lover home.

What disturbed me the most was how empty I felt inside. I couldn't cry. Couldn't scream. I was numb. My previous pack psychologist had called it a ‚Äòdefense mechanism.' ""You're denying your true feelings,"" she'd insisted during our sessions. ""Cry it out, Jane""

She might have been right, but right now, I didn't want to pay attention to anyone's opinion.

I just wanted a drink.

Without overthinking it, I pulled the car into the hidden lot behind Moonfall. I'd discovered the bar three years ago after a particularly vicious fight with Xander. This place has become my favorite bar since then. It was located on the very outskirts of werewolf city, hidden down an unmarked road. Particularly, there were no paparazzi lurking around, meaning no headlines like, ""Blackwood Pack's Luna Spotted Drinking Alone, Rumored Marriage Trouble with Alpha Xander.""

The moment I pushed the door open, the scent of shape-shifters from various clans hit me. Here, pack hierarchies and politics didn't matter, we were just ourselves. Unlike the pretentious establishments in the city where werewolves flaunted their status and treated other shapeshifters with disdain, Moonfall welcomed all.

I slid onto the leather barstool and caught the bartender's eye. ""Whiskey. Neat. And keep it coming.""

The bear shifter bartender, a huge man with a thick beard nodded and placed a heavy crystal tumbler in front of me. He poured my drink and leaned forward. ""Rough day?""

I took a long sip, sighing as the liquor burned the back of my throat. ""Not interested in talking.""

He shrugged. ""Fair enough. Name's Bob if you change your mind.""

I nodded at him and went back to my drink. I understood bartender's liked to listen to customer's, but now, I just wanted to lick my wounds alone.

I'd just finished my second drink when strong arms suddenly wrapped around me from behind. I stiffened instantly.

""Kate! There you are, sweetheart!"" A foreign deep voice said almost too loudly, as if he wanted someone to hear him.

The tall, handsome stranger slid onto the stool beside me. He smelled of pine forests after rain, a scent that made my wolf stir with unexpected interest. He was a werewolf too. I looked up at him, and almost did a double take. He was handsome, painfully so.

He had raven black hair, dreamy blue eyes, full kissable lips, set into what looked like a permanent smile. He was looking at me in such a way that almost made me weak in the knees. Almost.

The man suddenly leaned in close, grabbing my hands. ""Play along. I'll explain later.""

Before I could respond, a furious looking woman stormed across the bar toward us. ""Aaron!"" she snapped. ""So this is why you've been ignoring my calls?""

The stranger, Aaron, tightened his grip on me. ""You shouldn't be doing this in front of my wife.""

I didn't think her voice could get louder, but it did. ""Your wife?!""

He lifted my left hand where Xander's wedding ring was. ""Yes, Hazel. My wife.""

Her face suddenly twisted in disgust as she turned to face me. ""Seriously? You married this scumbag?""

""Hey!"" Aaron yelled. ""You can't talk to my wife like that.""

But her attention didn't shift from me. ""You can't see what your jerk of a husband did?"" I stared blankly at her, waiting for her to explain. ""He disappeared after we slept together. Not even a text! Just vanished like it meant nothing!""

Aaron looked deep into my eyes and brought my hands to his chest. He was trying real hard to sell this apologetic husband story. Xander needed to learn a thing or two from him. ""Because it didn't mean anything,"" Aaron replied, his eyes still on mine. ""It was a one-night stand. Just one night.""

""You absolute jerk! You made me believe‚Ä¶""

He held up a hand. ""I never promised you anything.""

""Go to hell,"" she spat at him. And then she turned to face me, eyes filled with pity and contempt. ""Good luck with your marriage to this piece of trash."" She stormed toward the exit, shouldering past a group of fox shifters.

Everything happened so fast that I sat frozen, my whiskey completely forgotten.

Aaron released my hand and exhaled dramatically. ""Thank the moon goddess that's over."" He ran his fingers through his dark hair. ""Sorry about dragging you into that. She's been following me for weeks. Showed up at my workplace yesterday.""

I blinked at him, still trying to process what had just happened. The confrontation had pulled me out of my misery for a moment, but I could feel it returning slowly.

He turned toward the bar, lifting his hand to signal Bruno. ""Let me buy you a drink. You definitely earned it, playing along like that.""

I stared at him, then glanced toward the door where Hazel had disappeared. The whole encounter had lasted maybe two minutes, but I was still dumbfounded.

My glass was empty. My marriage was in shambles. What could I possibly lose by having a drink with a handsome stranger? ""Let's get two glasses.""

Aaron grinned at me then turned to Bob. ""Two glasses it is.""

Chapter 4: A Crazy Plan.

\*Aaron\*

I could sit here and say that recruiting the help of this woman in avoiding Hazel was all a crazy coincidence, but that would be a lie.

I spotted her the moment I walked into the bar. She wasn‚Äôt just the most beautiful woman I‚Äôd ever seen, she was unique. Her scent hit me suddenly, almost knocking off the fragile bar stool. My wolf howled inside me, clawing at my chest in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. I shifted uncomfortably, surprised by my reaction.

The platinum band had been a disappointing surprise. Whoever her husband was, he better thank the moon goddess. He‚Äôs a damn lucky bastard.

The last time my wolf had been this restless was the night I met my mate Yve.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve been introduced. I‚Äôm Aaron.‚Äù

‚ÄúI gathered.‚Äù

Right. Hazel had been yelling my name with so much rage. ‚ÄúGreat. It‚Äôs only fair if you tell me yours‚Ä¶ even the playing field a little.‚Äù

She finally turned to face me, assessing me quietly. She said nothing, her eyes meeting mine for a second, maybe two. But it was enough.

Her lips parted slightly and I caught myself staring, mesmerized by the subtle curve of her mouth.

Shit. She probably thinks I was trying to flirt with her. I raised my hands in mock surrender, leaning away from her. ‚ÄúJust to be clear, I‚Äôm not trying to flirt. Women are‚Ä¶‚Äù I chuckled, shaking my head, ‚Äúfrankly, troublesome.‚Äù

She arched an eyebrow, letting me know I‚Äôd said the wrong thing. ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù she said flatly. ‚ÄúYou just happened to use a complete stranger as a shield against some innocent ex. Because all men are the same, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

Before I could defend myself, she turned away, reached for her glass of whiskey sitting on the bar and downed it in one gulp. My eyes widened, but I decided it was smart not to comment on it.

It had been exactly three weeks since I‚Äôd moved out of Claudia‚Äôs apartment and into this crumbling, half-condemned corner of Los Angeles. The kind of neighborhood people warned you about on online forums and true crime podcasts. Stray dogs howled at night. Power flickered if you dared to microwave something. The streets had more cracks than pavement, and the buildings leaned like they were whispering secrets to each other.

But no matter how hostile or decayed this place felt, it was still safer than where I came from.

We were supposed to start a new life here. Me and Claudia. A life in California, under big skies and second chances.

It‚Äôs not something I talk about because who would believe a 5‚Äô10 man over a 5‚Äô1 woman?

She didn‚Äôt hurt me with fists. It was all with words‚Äîmeticulously cruel ones. She had a gift for it. A scalpel for a tongue. She called it ‚Äújust being honest,‚Äù but honesty doesn‚Äôt leave you crying in parking lots, questioning your entire worth.

Claudia humiliated me every chance she got. She weaponized my vulnerabilities, the ones I gave her willingly, lovingly. She called me pathetic in front of her friends. She laughed at me in text threads she forgot to hide. And when I tried to leave, she got worse. Spiteful. Vindictive. She emptied my bank account under the excuse of needing money for her singing career, which never took off. Because let‚Äôs face it, the woman has about as much discipline as a wet sock.

Now I am here. Three weeks in. Barely surviving.

The only thing holding me together was the tiny gym in the basement of my crumbling apartment complex. The weights were rusty, the air was stale, and the mirrors warped. Strangely, there was a considerable number of weights. And there was enough weights here to complete my circuits. Since I couldn‚Äôt afford BJJ classes, lifting plates and doing reps was all I could do against the creeping madness of being twenty-four, broke, and completely alone.

I had nothing to show for anything but an associates degree and an academic dismissal record from UCLA, another one of Claudia‚Äôs many legacies. I had done well in community college back home in Florida, getting high marks. But all of that was over now.

As I finished my final overhead press, a deep tremor shook the building. The plates on the rack rattled like teeth. It was the third one that week. They had to be earthquakes. This city was after all sitting on the San Andreas fault.

The scientists on the news speculated it was subsidence. That they were ‚Äúshifting fault lines,‚Äù they and ‚Äúunderground instability due to water tables.‚Äù But these tremors felt too light, too sporadic, and too deliberate to be natural.

Squishy, writhing sounds were reported to have been heard along with the tremors by utility workers both on the surface and below ground. There were whispers of shadows moving in sinkholes, of screeching that didn‚Äôt sound human. But nothing was verified.

Before I could contemplate any of this further, I heard the door open.

I looked over and saw tanned skin, twin braids, black yoga shorts and a burgundy sports bra that framed her like she was carved from marble. Her eyes were soft but alert, deer-like. Her body was chiseled and toned, like that of a CrossFit instructor. Abs were slightly visible on her midriff.

She didn‚Äôt notice me as she walked past with her air pods in, stretching absently. As I moved through my circuit, I caught her reflection in the warped mirrors and caught her glancing at me too.

Thirty minutes later, I was done. As I made for the door, I passed one last mirror.

Our eyes locked. I then caught a ghost of a smile as I glanced into the mirror. Was that directed at me? I didn‚Äôt see anyone else besides the two of us in that tiny gym.

I didn‚Äôt think too much of it as I hauled myself back up the stairs and let myself into my apartment, muscles sore from all the weightlifting. The next morning, I was up early. Not that I could sleep very well, let alone need an alarm clock. The nightmares did a better job waking me up.

The tremors continued, still not showing patterns typical to earthquakes. They came in pulses, like breathing. Like something under us was stretching, waking up.

A baby‚Äôs cry jolted me upright. The sound came from outside my apartment.

I stepped out onto the narrow balcony. And there she was. The CrossFit lady from last night.

She sat on the porch next to mine, holding a softly crying baby close to her chest. No makeup now. Just sweatpants, a faded tank top, and those same braids trailing down her shoulders. Her tattoos were more visible now: a winding snake disappearing under the waistband of her pants, a mandala design on her shoulder, and just beneath her collarbone, a compass inked in black.

We locked eyes.

I braced for the usual gestures I get from girls. The eyerolls, turn aways, maybe a muttered ‚Äúwhat are you looking at?‚Äù as they glared at me.

But I was stunned when she smiled at me. Her expression was warm and welcoming. Her nose piercing glistened in the dawning light. She raised her tiny hand in a gentle wave.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she chirped with a slight pink hue washing over her cheeks.

I blinked, returning a crooked smile while waving back awkwardly. ‚ÄúH-hey.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou new around here?‚Äù she asked, voice low, almost lyrical. She sounded American, but something in her tone hinted at roots further south.

‚ÄúS-somewhat.‚Äù

She held my gaze, and her smirk. ‚ÄúMe too. Moved in two days ago.‚Äù

Her phone slipped from her pocket. ‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù She leaned over to grab it, and I caught another tattoo along her spine. It was some kind of text. Foreign. Faded. Like a scar she made beautiful.

The ground trembled again‚Äîmore forcefully this time. A soft¬†*crack*¬†echoed nearby. Somewhere close, maybe beneath us, something shifted.

She flinched. Just slightly.

‚ÄúYou feel that?‚Äù I asked.

She nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYeah. I have.‚Äù She said slightly rocking her baby.

We stood there in silence; the air was tight with a hint of unease.

I rubbed the back of my neck and adjusted my tie. ‚ÄúPlease excuse me. But I must get going.‚Äù

Her mouth curved into a wider smile, teeth glistening in the light. ‚ÄúHave a good day, Papi.‚Äù

I nervously glanced back and peeped a silent thanks as I walked away. I felt my cheeks flush a dark shade of red. If she called me Papi one more time, I swear I was going to melt into a gooey puddle on the floor. I walked to work like I always did. Four miles through a city that seemed to sag more with every step. The sidewalks had new cracks. Light poles leaned slightly further. Somewhere in the distance, I saw a patch of sidewalk that seemingly dipped into the ground.

A city utility truck was parked next to it, but no one was working. The cones had just been haphazardly placed there seemingly without thought. The caution tape attached nearby was fluttering like poorly poled flags.

I didn‚Äôt stop. I never did. When your life is unraveling, the best you can do is keep moving forward and pretend you‚Äôre still part of the world.

My job was at a massive, two-story building on the edge of the industrial district. It was a plain, mostly windowless two-story building located at the middle of assfuck metropolitan nowhere. The building is made of faded stucco and industrial concrete. It was designed more like a prison than a place where people worked eight hours a day.

From the outside, it looked like a cheaply built, square-shaped building with brutalist architecture. But inside, it was a labyrinth of cubicles stretching into fluorescent infinity. Dozens upon dozens of people sat in their little gray pens, their voices rising and falling like radio static as they answered calls, took complaints, and tried not to scream.

Thank God I didn‚Äôt work on the phones. I had my associate‚Äôs degree, which meant I was just qualified enough to be buried under spreadsheets instead of voicemails.

The front doors slid open, doors screeching slightly against the floor. I was immediately hit with the scent of burnt coffee and printer toner. The hum of bad lighting and worse ventilation in this makeshift warehouse-like building settled into my bones like it always did. This place didn‚Äôt just feel like a prison‚Äîit¬†*was*¬†one. A beige coffin they paid us to climb into for eight hours a day.

I remembered what one of the phone reps had once joked that working at a call center is like being in a prison they pay you to be at.

‚ÄúBout time you dragged your sorry behind in here, Martin,‚Äù chuckled a voice from behind the receptionist's desk.

It was Angela.

The office secretary‚Äîand unofficial queen of sarcasm. A short, sharp-tongued African American woman in her twenties with perfect eyeliner, impossibly long nails, and a voice that could cut through drywall. She had a gold tooth that glinted every time she smiled.

‚ÄúYou tryna set a record for ‚Äòmost zombies avoided during a morning commute‚Äô or what?‚Äù she said, raising one painted brow.

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù I muttered, cracking a smile despite myself.

She nodded once. ‚ÄúMhm. You look like you fought off three sinkholes and a bad haircut on the way here.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt wrong. I nevertheless gave her a mock salute and headed toward the accounting corner. My cubicle was in the back left corner of the building, away from the worst of the call center noise but close enough to hear it leak through the thin walls. The overhead fluorescents buzzed like dying flies.

I sat down at my desk, logged in, and opened my first spreadsheet of the day. Line after line of vendor totals, expenses, revenues, balance reconciliations, and overdue reimbursements. The kind of mindless repetition that blurred the hours and dulled your soul in equal measure. $16.50 an hour. No benefits. No 401(k). Just the soft promise that if I stayed long enough, I might get a .50 cent raise.

My boss, Martha, made her appearance around 9:30 AM. I heard her before I saw her‚Äîheels clicking down the linoleum like gunshots. Martha was Jamaican, in her early fifties, with close-cropped hair, brilliant earrings, and a laugh that came out like a punchline to a joke you weren‚Äôt sure you wanted to hear. She had a gold tooth like Angela, but hers caught the light like a warning. She had a wicked, dark sense of humor that made some people uncomfortable‚Äîbut I liked it.

‚ÄúMartin,‚Äù she said, peeking over my cubicle wall like a cat scoping prey. ‚ÄúYou still alive?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù I muttered, fingers tapping numbly at my keyboard.

‚ÄúGood. Keep it that way. Dead men don‚Äôt process expense reports.‚Äù

She laughed to herself and sauntered off, leaving the faint scent of her cocoa butter lotion.

The day dragged on like it always did. Coffee. Data entry. Boring emails. Then more spreadsheets. But sometime around noon, the power flickered. The monitors blinked. The lights overhead dimmed for a heartbeat.

No one said anything. Everyone just froze for a moment. A few of us glanced around the low ceiling and suffocated claustrophobic walls around us, eyes darting around. After a minute or two of eerie stillness, the murmurs and mutterings between friends and coworkers continued as people resumed their calls and activities.

Eight hours later, my shift ended, and I went over to my locker in the common area where you had to surrender your belongings before being let into the facility. I took out my bag and changed out of my work clothes into athletic wear. I immediately hit the streets and began my two-mile walk; I wanted to get home before sunset.

As I proceeded down the street, I walked up a rather steep ramp that had a view of both the overpass, along with the beach and the green hills just below the horizon. As I passed by one intersection, my eyes twitched slightly at the sight of what I was seeing as my eyes scanned the horizon below. The homeless camps looked as if they were bunched further together, as if they were somehow being pushed together.

It was subtle. The kind of change you'd only notice if you saw the place every day like I did. Tents that once stood apart now pressed shoulder to shoulder, like frightened animals. And where there had once been trash fires and voices, there was now silence and smoke that curled in tight spirals.

I stopped walking. Something about it gnawed at the back of my brain. Then the ground beneath me¬†*twitched*.

Not a quake. Not the full-body shake of tectonic plates rubbing together. This was sharper. Quicker. Like something huge had just¬†*moved*¬†underneath the concrete‚Äîshifted its weight and went still again.

I looked around. A few cars passed by on the overpass above, indifferent. A cyclist swerved wide to avoid a pothole and didn‚Äôt even flinch. I rubbed my eyes. Maybe I was tired. Maybe my brain was trying to make sense of the caffeine crash and the flickering lights from earlier.

As I kept walking, the sky was melted into a deep orange, then red, the kind of sunset that looked like the world had been dipped in fire. Shadows stretched out in strange ways‚Äîlonger than they should‚Äôve, curling and jagged, bending against the grain of the buildings.

I treaded up the sidewalk, the soles of my sneakers tapping softly against the cracked concrete. The sun had nearly dipped behind the hills, bleeding amber and violet across the sky like bruises. The air smelled faintly of salt, sweat, and ozone.

And once more‚ÄîI saw her. The Hispanic woman from the gym.

She was coming down the slope toward the apartment complex, her hands lightly gripping the handles of a black stroller. Her infant daughter was bundled inside, tiny fists rising and falling as she dozed.

She wore yoga shorts and a fitted sports bra, her figure lean and powerful, like someone who worked hard for her peace. Her long dark hair was braided into two tight plaits, and her skin glowed golden in the dying light.

She tilted her head just a little, and her mouth curved into a warm, quiet smile. A genuine one. The kind that felt like it didn‚Äôt get used enough but hadn‚Äôt forgotten how.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said softly, her smile brightening.

‚ÄúH-Hey,‚Äù I stammered, nearly tripping on a raised section of sidewalk.

‚ÄúJust getting back from work?‚Äù she asked.

I nodded. Too hard. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt flinch at my awkwardness. Didn‚Äôt look away.

‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù

I forced a smile. Tried to hold myself together like I hadn‚Äôt been unraveling all day.

‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶ predictable, I guess.‚Äù

She let out a small laugh. It was light and real and made something flicker in my chest I didn‚Äôt want to name.

‚ÄúPredictable means stable,‚Äù she said with a ghost of a smile tugging at her lips.

‚ÄúI-I-I‚Ä¶‚Äù I rubbed the back of my neck, heat crawling into my cheeks. Jesus. Me and my neurodivergent slow brain. Hesitating, flailing, stammering like a car with octagon wheels,

She tilted her head again, studying me. Not with judgment, but curiosity. Like she was waiting for me to catch up to myself.

‚ÄúI should get going,‚Äù I said. I didn‚Äôt mean it, not really. I just didn‚Äôt know how to handle standing in front of a woman who looked like she walked off the cover of Vogue and spoke to me like I was worth her time. But instead of brushing it off or saying goodnight, she looked at me and asked looking up at me with a pouty lip and puppy eyes: ‚ÄúDo you want to walk with me?‚Äù

I blinked. The baby stirred slightly in the stroller.

My brain tripped over itself, repeating old advice:¬†*Don‚Äôt date single moms. It‚Äôs complicated. You‚Äôre not ready. She‚Äôs out of your league.*

Then, the voice that had been whispering in my ear for months‚Äî*You‚Äôre broken, no one wants you, you‚Äôre not enough*‚Äîsuddenly fell silent.

‚Äú...S-sure,‚Äù I said.

Her smile returned, cheekbones pressed higher on her face. She turned, and I fell in beside her.

The sidewalk curved gently toward the complex, and as we walked, I noticed how quiet the evening was. No dogs barking. No traffic. No laughter from the playground up the block. Just the crunch of gravel beneath our feet, and the low creak of the stroller wheels.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do you do?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in accounting,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAt a call center. Not glamorous. What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI work full time at a warehouse. I‚Äôm a supervisor.‚Äù she said.

I nodded. ‚ÄúYou seem like you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ good at it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI try.‚Äù She looked down at her daughter with a quiet affection. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my ‚Äòwhy.‚Äô‚Äù

There was a silence after that, but not a bad one. A soft one.

Then, just as we reached the gate of the complex, the ground beneath us gave a sudden, short¬†*jolt*. The stroller‚Äôs wheels bounced slightly. I reached out instinctively, steadying it before it could tip.

Her eyes darted to me. ‚ÄúAnother one?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I said slowly. ‚ÄúFelt that one under my feet.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the third time this week.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird. Doesn‚Äôt feel like earthquakes. More like‚Ä¶ movement.‚Äù

We both turned and looked back toward the hill, toward the horizon where the last sliver of sun dipped beneath the horizon.

And for just a second, I thought I saw something¬†*shift*¬†in the asphalt far up the road. Like the street itself had¬†*breathed*. Her hand tightened slightly on the stroller.

We sat on an old wooden bench near the entrance to the apartment courtyard, just beyond the iron gate that never quite latched right. The stroller was parked beside us, the baby asleep and swaddled in a soft yellow blanket, her breathing slow and even.

The air had cooled just enough to raise goosebumps, the pavement still radiating the day's heat in long, tired exhales. Above us, the sky had gone a shade darker, stars struggling to break through the haze of city light. She leaned back on the bench, braids falling over her shoulders. She then tilted her face to the sky like someone trying to remember what peace felt like.

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Rosa,‚Äù

‚ÄúMartin.‚Äù

She let off a light toothy smile.

I tilted my head and asked. ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm from El Salvador,‚Äù she began. ‚ÄúMy family‚Ä¶ they weren‚Äôt safe.‚Äù

I sat still, letting her speak, Tilting my head slightly.

‚ÄúMy cousin was murdered when I was seventeen. Shot in front of our house by some gang guys. I think it was a message. Something about turf. No one ever explained it, not really.‚Äù

My eyes widened slightly.

‚ÄúA man offered to get me out. Said he would sponsor me. That I could send money home. He made it sound like salvation.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut when I got here,‚Äù Her lips pursed, and her voice got heavy. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt long before they started shuttling me around to various hotels around California. They drugged me, tattooed me, beat me.‚Äù I could see the tears coming down her cheeks.

I tilted my head as a breeze moved through the park. The leaves rustled just slightly.

‚ÄúHis name was Diego. He‚Äôs MS-13. A shot-caller, I think. Women were like currency to him.‚Äù She then looked down at her stroller. ‚ÄúI got pregnant, and he got worse. Possessive. Violent. I left when I was seven months in. Hid in a homeless shelter for weeks.‚Äù

I held a hand to my mouth. ‚ÄúGod.‚Äù

She took a breath, steadied herself. ‚ÄúThey helped me file for something called a T visa. For survivors of trafficking. I had to tell them everything. About Diego. About the others. I still get calls from law enforcement sometimes, asking for more names.‚Äù

I just stared at her. I didn‚Äôt say a word. I didn‚Äôt know much about immigration laws. I just knew that many of the workers at the call center spoke broken English and I‚Äôm highly confident many were not here legally.

‚ÄúThose let you stay for four years. After three, you can apply for permanent residency if you‚Äôve cooperated and stayed clean?‚Äù I asked.

She nodded. ‚ÄúThat, and my daughter was born here.‚Äù

Another silence passed, this one thicker. Then she turned her gaze to me. ‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù

I shifted on the bench. ‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are¬†*you*¬†running from?‚Äù

I frowned and furrowed my eyebrows. ‚ÄúHer name was Claudia. She‚Ä¶ she said a lot of things. Most of them stuck.‚Äù

I stared down at my hands. The words came slowly in a tone that was laced with both sorrow and grief. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd call me names. Said I was broken. That I wasn‚Äôt enough. That no one would ever want me. Said I was too weird. Too robotic. That my voice made her want to scream. She used to make fun of the way I stim. Or the way I go quiet when there‚Äôs too much noise.‚Äù

Rosa‚Äôs jaw dropped slightly.

‚ÄúShe said I was on the spectrum and that no one would love someone like that. Like me.‚Äù

Rosa tilted her head, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúL-like you? On the spectrum?‚Äù

I let off a deep sigh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ on the spectrum.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat explains a few things. So let me guess, she weaponized it?‚Äù Rosa said, her voice a blade.

‚ÄúYeah. But I thought it was love, so I stayed. I kept trying to be better. Quieter. Less‚Ä¶ me.‚Äù

Rosa reached out and touched my hand. Her fingers were rough with calluses but gentle. I looked over to her and we locked eyes. She wore no makeup, eyeliner, or blush, not that she needed it. God, this woman was gorgeous. I just stared at her, feeling her hand on mine. I then placed my hand on hers. Rosa‚Äôs smile grew wide and glistening.

The ground beneath us tremored slightly. We both looked around frantically. Rosa held onto the stroller a little more tightly.

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI'm no geologist, but that didn‚Äôt feel like an earthquake.‚Äù

She took her hand off mine and held it to her head. ‚ÄúI-I have a lot of laundry to do. I need to get going. Ill see you later!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey wait!‚Äù

She looked back at me, grip maintained on the stroller.

‚ÄúI actually have laundry to do to. Would it be okay if‚Ä¶‚Äù I struggled to get the words out.

Her frown quickly turned into a smirk. ‚ÄúJoin me? While doing laundry?‚Äù she then laughed.

I felt my cheeks flush. ‚ÄúForget it. It was a dumb ques-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay. It can get pretty lonely at the laundromat. I could use the company.‚Äù She said with a glistening grin.

Later that evening, we both went to the laundromat. We both had a large stack of clothes we needed to take care of. The TV in the complex laundromat window glowed blue through the entire room. We were both loading up laundry into the machine.

Just then, a breaking news banner crawled across the bottom of the screen.

**""Violence in South L.A. linked to suspected MS-13 resurgence‚Äîmultiple stabbings, one missing person, bodies found near riverbed.""**

Rosa turned her attention away from the thong, and me. Her eyes locked onto the screen, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Her voice was quiet. Controlled. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre moving again.‚Äù

I looked at her. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs Diego?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer right away. ‚ÄúIt could be him. Or someone he knows. If he knows where I am...‚Äù

I saw it. Just for a second. The crack in her armor.

We stood there under the flickering laundromat light, the hum of bad wiring vibrating faintly in the silence. Then she turned to me, her expression different now. Measured, careful.

‚ÄúWould you... feel comfortable staying with me tonight?‚Äù

My brain stuttered. ‚ÄúWh-what?‚Äù

She rubbed her arm. ‚ÄúIf you, you wouldn‚Äôt mind. Its just‚Ä¶ so I can feel safe.‚Äù

I stood there and stared at her for what felt like hours. The memories crept inside my head like a parasitic amoeba.

‚ÄúMartin?‚Äù she tilted her head. ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúY-yeah I‚Äôm fine. Are you sure you‚Äôre okay with that? I-I don‚Äôt want you to feel uncomfortable.‚Äù

She giggled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. I don‚Äôt bite.‚Äù

She gave a small nod and motioned toward the stairwell. We moved quietly, the creaking of the old stairs somehow louder in the dark. When we reached her apartment, she unlocked the door, nudged it open, and stepped aside for me. It was small but clean. The baby was still asleep in her stroller. Rosa gently lifted her into a small bassinet tucked in the corner of the bedroom.

‚ÄúYou can set your stuff down anywhere,‚Äù she said, slipping off her sandals.

I hovered awkwardly just inside the doorway, my eyes flicking to the bed. It was modest, with a thick comforter and a small lamp on the nightstand.

‚ÄúDo you...‚Äù Rosa said slowly, turning toward me, ‚Äúfeel okay sharing the bed?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôve never done that before.‚Äù

She blinked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never shared a bed with a girl?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI mean... I‚Äôve dated. But I was always guilted into sleeping on the couch. She said I breathed too loud.""

Rosa stared at me for a long moment, her face unreadable.

‚ÄúShe made me feel like a parasite,‚Äù I added quietly. ‚ÄúEven when I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong.‚Äù

She looked like she wanted to say something but didn‚Äôt. Instead, she came from the other room after setting Sofia in her crib. She climbed into her side of the bed. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs space,‚Äù she said, patting the spot next to her.

I stood frozen for a second longer, then moved slowly, sitting on the edge of the mattress like it might give out under me. I kicked off my shoes and lay back stiffly, arms crossed over my chest like a mummy. Rosa wrapped her arm around me, snuggling up to me closely, burying her face in my neck.

The ceiling was dim. My breath was too loud in my ears. I could feel Rosa, however, soundlessly giggling and smiling into my neck.

Then, the flashbacks came.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just... so needy all the time, Martin. It‚Äôs exhausting.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDo you even know how to be normal? Like, just for a day?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou should be grateful someone like me even talks to you.‚Äù*

My jaw clenched. I felt like I was underwater again, drowning in the echoes.

I blinked and saw Claudia‚Äôs face in my mind, twisted with scorn. The smell of wine on her breath. The way she used to smile¬†*after*¬†the cruelty.

‚ÄúMartin?‚Äù

Rosa‚Äôs voice pulled me back, but I didn‚Äôt answer right away.

I was still there‚Äîon that couch, arms wrapped around my knees, hoping silence would make the yelling stop.

‚ÄúMartin,‚Äù she said again, softer this time. Her hand gently touched my arm. I flinched.

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù I breathed, moving to the edge of the bed, back facing her.

‚ÄúSorry? For what?‚Äù she asked, lying towards me.

I pressed my fingers to my temples. ‚ÄúI-I-I-‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt get the words out.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. It will be okay.‚Äù She said tightening herself to me like a koala bear. ‚ÄúJust hold me please.‚Äù

I sighed and turned around to face her. Slowly. We lay there for a while in silence, both of us lying there, eyes closed, lights off. A distant siren echoed, and underneath it...A¬†*low*¬†rumble. Deep. Faint. Like something was dragging itself slowly beneath the city‚Äôs skin. Neither of us spoke. But we both heard it.

She gently pushed me onto the bed. I swallowed hard and adjusted myself accordingly. She slid next to me and clambered onto me like a koala bear, burying her face in my neck. I could feel her breathing into me as she giggled.

The next morning, the sky was chalky, bruised yellow. I gingerly let myself out the door, glancing over my shoulder at a sleeping Rosa, and then over to the nursery where baby Isabella was. I carefully walked down the uneven stairs of the apartment complex, trying not to wake the baby.

‚ÄúPlease come home.‚Äù I faintly heard her mutter under her breath as I left the room.

But upon traversing onto the street, my eyes set upon the streets before me, and a creeping dread settled into my gut.

The roads, tarmac and pavement before me warped like old skin, looking a lot more disjointed than they did yesterday. Cracks widened overnight, becoming jagged, dark, and¬†*wet*. The asphalt peeled back in long, curling strips like snakeskin. Trash cans, mailboxes and other utilities lay toppled over. Their contents spilled over onto the streets or otherwise half-swallowed by shallow depressions and potholes in the ground. Pigeons, crows and other birds picked at food wrappers, then flew back into the sky. As the familiarity of my surroundings settled into my senses, a cold dread settled into my gut as the realization about my usual route fell upon me like a ten-ton anvil.

**There were sinkholes, everywhere. A lot more than yesterday.**

But three of them had appeared near the bus stop I normally passed, gaping like open mouths.  
One was filled with murky water while the other two were just dark. But the most unsettling thing about the area was that there were no signs, no cones, or indeed, the presence of very many utility workers. There was just spray paint on the concrete in orange that read ‚ÄúTEMP CLOSED‚Äù in a rush-job scrawl. I nevertheless resumed my walk to the call center, treading carefully along the pavement.

I arrived at the call center a half hour later.

Security gates didn‚Äôt buzz open anymore; they were just left ajar. I just walked on by. I immediately noticed the parking lot only had a fifth of the automobiles that were normally there. When I entered, the fluorescents inside flickered like the pulse of something sick. It was hot, scorching hot, like the air conditioning stopped working. It was like walking into an oversized oven.

It also felt eerie. Namely because there was no good reason to miss work or school today. There were no incoming natural disasters or orders from the state government to evacuate. Yet people were seemingly bolting without permission from anyone. I didn‚Äôt even need to swipe my badge to get in. The call center‚Äôs main lobby, normally buzzing with noise, energy and life, today was empty.

There was no receptionist. No coffee machine hum. No quiet morning chatter. Just silence.

I made my way to the second floor where most of the windows were. The overhead lights buzzed faintly. Only a few desks were occupied, scattered like survivors. Of the forty or so people who normally made up the floor, I counted¬†**less than ten.**¬†And close to all of them were not their usual selves. Even the loud, cheerful ones looked haunted.

I noticed one woman with pale, sunken eyes. Another woman was visibly shaking, hands wrapped around a Styrofoam cup that had long since stopped steaming as she stared mindlessly at her screen.

I passed by Mitch from sales. Normally boisterous and rowdy what being he was in sales. Always showing off sports stats. Today, he stared at his screen like it was the edge of a cliff.

‚ÄúMitch?‚Äù I asked.

He glanced up at me, then his attention went back to the screen.

‚ÄúYou hear about Greta?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúShe saw the ground swallow a whole house. Right near her condo. She said she could hear people screaming, but there was nothing she could do. The road looked like soup. She quit. Took off last night without even a notice. She didn‚Äôt even pack her stuff.‚Äù

He turned to me, slowly. His eyes were¬†*red*. Not just tired‚Äîbloodshot and threaded like something had broken in him.

‚ÄúThis place‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not safe anymore. Not this city. Not this building. You feel it?‚Äù

I nodded. It was becoming painfully obvious.

Later that morning, I passed by the security desk again. The guard‚ÄîCamilla, a usually chipper girl‚Äîwas slumped forward in her chair, watching grainy camera feeds twitch with static.

I asked her about the missing people. About the roadblocks, and the sinkholes. She didn‚Äôt answer at first. Just kept watching the feed.

Then, without looking at me, she said: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay here.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

She finally looked at me. Her eyes were¬†*too dry.*¬†Like she hadn‚Äôt blinked in hours. She turned back to the monitors.

‚ÄúGet out while you can.‚Äù She said in a low, yet unassuming voice. ‚ÄúTomorrow. Preferably tonight.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúThe paychecks get processed tomorrow.‚Äù

She glanced over at me, expression hardened as he slowly shook his head. ‚ÄúAnother hundred dollars doesn‚Äôt mean shit when you‚Äôre dead. I know what I‚Äôm doing. Mama lives in Nevada.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt pay too much heed. I just went over to my desk and resumed my duties as usual. I was busy as usual. But I noticed that new work was not coming down the pipeline and into my inbox. My boss wasn‚Äôt looking over my shoulder or sending me emails like she normally did. Indeed, I haven‚Äôt run into her at all since I came in this morning.

Before I knew it, it was five. I clocked out and headed out the door. The security guard I passed earlier wasn‚Äôt there, and the building felt even more empty than this morning. It was so quiet I could hear my own voice bounce off the walls. I felt the ground below me lightly shake, but it was followed by a slithering, writhing sound. The rumbling intensified.

The lights then went out. It took me about a half a second to register that the power just went out.

I then heard loud crashing sounds coming from outside.

The automatic door was jammed, and I had to force it open. As I stepped outside into the midday sun, I came into a parking lot that was now completely empty. This was when I got the emergency alert on my phone:

UNUSUAL SEISMIC ACTIVITY DETECTED! TAKE SHELTER! EVACUATE IF POSSIBLE!

My heart fell in my chest as I witnessed the two-story building next to ours collapse into the ground, falling into a massive sinkhole. Cement crumbled inward like paper. A cloud of¬†**dust and screams**¬†billowed into the air. And through it ‚Äì I heard it.

**The writhing, and the wet slapping. The friction of something unnatural squeezing through bedrock, coming from directly below. It had to be massive.**

I didn‚Äôt need a second invitation. I quickly made my way out of the plaza and onto the main road. I normally took an hour to get home, but I was determined to reach Rosa, so I decided to move as fast as I could.

I got another buzz on my phone. Another emergency alert? Maybe it was Rosa?! I took it out of my pocket to check for any possible updates. But I was surprised to see who it was.

‚ÄúHey! Martin? It‚Äôs Claudia. I heard the reports and wanted to know if you were doing alright! Are you still in Los Angeles? Are you alright? Are you safe? Please let me know! I worry so much about you.‚Äù

Unbelievable. It was Claudia. Now of all times she decides to reach out to me? After three months of total silence? I sighed deeply, looking down at the text, completely dumbfounded. I regardless ignored it and phoned Rosa.

She picked up‚Äî*thank God*‚Äîbut she was already mid-sentence, voice frantic.

‚ÄúMartin‚Äîit‚Äôs a madhouse here. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. People are‚Äî‚Äù

*‚ÄúWhat? Rosa, slow down‚Äî‚Äù*

‚ÄúA car just sank outside.¬†*It was just parked*, and the whole street opened like a zipper, and-‚Äù

**I then heard a scream from her end of the line.**¬†It was a raw,¬†**soul-ripping sound**¬†that made my blood run cold.

‚ÄúSOMETHINGS DOWN HERE! IT‚ÄôS-‚Äù

The call cut off. And what followed was an eerie, unsettling silence. I shook my head and made my way onto the tarmac.

Then it burst through the road before me. Chunks of asphalt flew like thrown bricks and debris. And from the earth rose¬†**what I could only describe as a grotesque splice of giant earthworm, tapeworm and leech.**¬†**It was a massive, fleshy, annelid. The best image that comes to mind is that of the sandworms from Dune, the graboids from Tremors and the carnictus from King Kong**

**It was covered in slime and glistening mucus. It was as long as a charter bus. Its maw was lined with spiraling, grinding teeth. It had no eyes, just a large, gaping, open mouth aligned with razor-sharp teeth, wide enough to look like it could swallow a car whole.**

**It was writhing slowly through the air.**¬†It reared up from the street with a screech like tearing metal, flailing about like a baby bird clamoring for food. The creature then¬†**slid back down**¬†into the road, tunneling¬†**just below the next building.**¬†The sidewalk connected to it cracked like glass.

**Then it hit me. There were little to no sinkholes at the foot of the buildings laden on solid cement. I deduced the giant worms couldn‚Äôt break through the concrete foundation.**¬†But the¬†**tarmac**?

The¬†**roads**? The¬†**sidewalks**? Or even the tarmac?¬†**They were risky.**

I moved around the building to the side exit, across the narrow strip of cement walkway.  
**Not the road.**¬†At that point, I wasn‚Äôt walking anymore, I was running or otherwise jogging towards the apartment, being extra careful to avoid the more brittle and fragile parts of the road.

I was exhausted by the time I finally reached the apartment half an hour later, careful to avoid the roads and tarmac, practically sprinting from building to building.

The door was ajar, and a chill ran down my spine. Knowing what I knew about Rosa, it wasn‚Äôt like her leaving the door open like that. It was too quiet. I heard nothing coming from the apartment. No baby cries. I heard no humming either. The light was on but barely. I couldn‚Äôt see anything through the closed blinds.

The door creaked faintly as I nudged it open with my foot. Inside, the lights were dim‚Äîbarely flickering from a loose ceiling fixture, casting everything in sickly yellow hues. Something wasn‚Äôt right. Of the handful of times, I‚Äôve been here, it‚Äôs never been this eerily quiet. The fact that the door wasn‚Äôt even closed furthered my unease.

‚ÄúRosa?‚Äù I called softly.

‚ÄúMartin?‚Äù Came her voice. But she didn‚Äôt sound like her sprightly self.¬† It was flat. Measured. Like someone reading from a script.¬†**Her tone was off**. No trembling, no relief, no panic. The tone was far too calm considering the circumstances.

I stepped inside cautiously, trying not to make a sound on the creaking laminate floor.

She was kneeling in the living room. Rigid. Shoulders high. Her eyes met mine, wide and glassy, like a trapped animal. Her lips mouthed ‚Äúyou came,‚Äù but her eyes were pleading with me not to take another step forward.

That‚Äôs when I heard a gun cocking and something cold being pressed to the back of my head.

‚ÄúHands up, g√ºero.‚Äù

Chapter 1 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 001

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.



""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. 



He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""



My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""



I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that st\*\*id handmade card on his desk. 



The one I'd spent hours making, like a f\*\*l who still believed in fairy tales. The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. 



Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.



My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.



""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""



The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. 



""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.



""Is there someone else?""



The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""



One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.



""How long?""



""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""



""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped ki\*\*ing me goodbye in the mornings.



""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""



""I didn't want to hurt you.""



A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""



My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. 



Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.



""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.



""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""



I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.



The world stopped.



I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.



""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""



Stefan's silence said everything.



Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving to\*\*ts at our engagement party. 



Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.



My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.



""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at st\*\*id, naive Camille.""



""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""



""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""



He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""



Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.



""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""



""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""



""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. 



""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""



Bl\*\*d dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.



""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""



""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""



""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""



I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.



""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""



I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.



""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""



""Where are you going?""



""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""



My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.



I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""



""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""



""Camille, please...""



""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""



""For what?""



""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""



I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bl\*\*dy fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.



Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.



My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.



Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.



In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, bl\*\*d stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.



I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.





Chapter 2 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 002

The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. 



The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else's life.



The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.



When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I'd left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.



My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.



I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. 



Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.



The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.



My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.



""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""



I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.



The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.



""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""



I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.



More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.



""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""



A third set of footsteps made my bl\*\*d freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.



""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""



I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. 



Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.



What a joke.



The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:



\---



""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""



Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""



Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.



""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!



I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.



Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.



No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.



Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.



\---



""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""



I opened my bedroom door.



They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.



""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fianc√©?""



Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""



""Explain what? How you've been sl\*\*ping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""



""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.



""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""



""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. 



""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""



Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.



""It wasn't like that,"" she started.



""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sl\*\*ping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out li\*\*erie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""



""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""



""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.



His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""



The silence that followed was deafening.



Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""



The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a g\*\*shot.



""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""



""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""



I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.



""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""



I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.



""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""



""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""



I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""



Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.



""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""



I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.





Chapter 3 ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW 003

I swirled the ch\*\*pagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years.



The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.



What a joke.



""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.



My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. 



Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.



I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm w\*\*e.



\---



The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.



I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. 



They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.



Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.



""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""



She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.



I wanted to vomit.



Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. 



Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.



And she didn't even appreciate it properly.



I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad.



How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.



""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis... Mom... had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""



That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.



It was beautiful.



\---



My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.



""Darling, you're being needy.""



""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""



""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.""



""I just... the way she looked at me...""



""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""



""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""



""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""



I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak.



Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.



But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.



The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. 



Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.



God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.



A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. 



Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.



Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.



The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. 



Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.



Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.



Where I could watch her.



I took another sip of ch\*\*pagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. 



Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.



No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.



My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""



I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.



By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.



Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.



The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.



Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.



Id\*\*t.



I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. 



How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.



She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.



Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.



My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. 



Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.



But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.



Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. 



The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.



""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""



But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. 



Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.



It had looked almost like... understanding.



Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.



I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.



But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.





Chapter 4 STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW 004

The sc\*\*ch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. 



My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.



Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes,  already looking past her, always looking for Rose.



Rose.



Even her name felt like betrayal now.



My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""



Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.



The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.



\---



""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""



I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

1nnatel,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nnatel/i_just_terminated_a_relationship_via_whatsapp/,I just terminated a relationship via Whatsapp message,"AITA? I was dating this girl for a few months, went exclusive a couple months back.

The problem here is we each have some grievances against each other:

On her side, she felt like I wasn't a very caring person. First up, I didn't greet her in the morning via whatsapp, which she mentioned to me, after which I did greet her, but only said good morning and nothing else, which she felt was rather uncaring too. In truth in the morning before my coffee kicks in I really don't feel like chatting with anyone, but for her sake I did it.

Another issue is that she felt I was a very poor talker; few examples:

1. She was asking me about liking other girls' insta posts / stories, and how come I didn't like hers, to which I said well if you had new ones of course I'd like or comment on them, but going back to like all your old ones is kinda stalker-ish right? She wasn't too happy on that - felt like I should have said more sweet stuff to her.

2. She took a double dose of medicine at night and told me, I just said to take care and hope she felt better in the morning. She felt I should have told her to be more careful next time etc etc etc

3. Final straw - she told me she had some insta stories so I checked it out and told her she did some beautiful effects on the last story. She went ""how about the other stories"" and I went ""well this is the nicest one"". She was like okok you win and I send a tongue out emoji, upon which she lost it.

Basically she feels I'm an uncaring person and she's doing all the emotional labor in the relationship.

On my end I feel like I did take care of her, apart from driving over to fetch her when we go out and covering the bills, I also send food when she hasn't got enough to eat at home and fruit for her (she earns less and has to support parents). My primary complaint is that she only makes time for me a couple times a month, her reason being that she is tired from work and only comes out on Saturdays, so if she meets friends then we can't meet that week. 

I also don't like to be constantly dumped on for being a poor sweet-talker. As per her own admission she was actually looking for something to pick on me so that I would say stuff to comfort her and make her happy.

Also basically after we got together, she kinda felt like I pushed her into the relationship because I asked once and then a month later, she said alright as she liked me but she would really have preferred that I wait longer (6 months or more dated from us getting to know each other). This made her feel some pressure (her words). Imo she could have said no, I would just have re-evaluated the whole thing then.

Recently I went for a work trip for a week and a couple days in she started sounding cold via text. So I asked her if anything was wrong and she said we would discuss when I got back. I got back and asked her on Sunday, she said she wanted to talk face to face. I said I've been waiting a long time and I'm stressed out, please tell me now what this is all about. She refused and saying I was being pushy again, and said we could discuss on the next Saturday. By this time I was sick of everything and just messaged her that I don't think we are a good fit, I think she treats me poorly and let's call an end to it. Then I went to sleep.

I do know that breaking up via Whatsapp isn't the standard for dating etiquette, but I was very fed up about having to sit around another week to find out what she was angry about again. So AITA?

PART I.,"[PART II](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1n88i4b/i_booked_an_escort_not_of_our_world_part_ii/)¬†is up! You can find it in the link!

It started like any other day.

I work a typical 9 to 5 in a gray-walled office wedged between a refinery and a cold storage depot. It was nothing glamorous. Just payroll, inventory, and data entry. The warehouse out back hums with forklifts and pallets and smells like oil, steel, and stale coffee. It‚Äôs industrial purgatory. My job is to make sure the numbers line up and nobody‚Äôs skimming off the top.

I usually clock out around dusk, when the sodium lights flicker on and the sky turns bruised and yellow. That night, I lingered a little longer‚Äîtriple-checking a shipment invoice that didn‚Äôt sit right. A truckload of supplies had gone unlogged. No signature, no weight data, no product line. Just a blank space where there should have been something. Or someone.

From my second-floor office window, I had a clear view of the backloading dock.

That‚Äôs when I saw the truck.

A large, white freight hauler‚Äîunmarked, the kind that smells like bleach and cold sweat‚Äîbacked into the far bay with its lights off. It rolled in slow, deliberate, like it didn‚Äôt want to be seen. A man in a reflective vest emerged from the cab, then opened the rear doors.

And then‚Ä¶ they stepped out one by one.

Four women. At first glance, they looked like human girls, but they had unusual features. I couldn‚Äôt quite make them out as they each wore oversized coats they pulled tight around their bodies, as if they were trying to disappear into the fabric. Their eyes were wide searching the shadows, like prey searching for their predators. One stumbled slightly as she hit the concrete, catching herself with trembling fingers.

I should‚Äôve called someone.

But something stopped me. Something about their faces.

They were beautiful. Almost too beautiful. The kind of beauty that feels more¬†*designed*¬†than born. I squinted against the glass, trying to parse what I was seeing.

For example, one woman‚Äôs skin had a faint reddish hue, not from blush or windburn, but something deeper. She had undertones that shimmered when the light caught her cheek just right. Small, curling horns poked through the top of her head, as her dark black hair was cropped short just below her neck.

They looked too connected to her forehead to be prosthetic.

I told myself they were costumes. Makeup. Some kind of elaborate viral stunt. A haunted house promo maybe, or one of those weird immersive theater things rich people pay thousands for.

But what kind of show leaves its actors looking like they‚Äôre terrified out of their minds? What kind of role demands fear that raw?

One of the girls looked right at me.

I caught the longing in her eyes, the fear, and the desperation. And in that moment, I knew she wasn‚Äôt playing a part.

None of them were.

A few men emerged from the yawning darkness of the warehouse. Their movements were slow, casual, like this was routine. No shouting, no barking of orders. Just calm, practiced movements. They didn‚Äôt have uniforms, but they wore dark jackets and work gloves. One of them held a clipboard, as if this was just another delivery to log.

The girls hesitated at the edge of the truck‚Äôs shadow, but a sharp gesture from one of the men sent them filing inside in a single, obedient line. No protest. No resistance. Just the slow, hollow shuffle of sandaled feet on concrete as they filed one by one single file into the warehouse.

Something about their silence made the hair rise on my arms.

Without thinking, I grabbed my keys and left the building. My heart jackhammered in my chest as I went to the back of the building, out of sight, where my vehicle was parked. I slid into my car and pulled away from my usual spot, circling around the far end of the lot, just past a rusted chain-link fence, where many unused vehicles remained in an unpaved lot. I tucked in beside a few of them, out of view, and killed the engine.

From there, I had a clear line of sight to the warehouse‚Äôs open bay.

The men were stripping the girls.

They peeled away the oversized coats like they were shedding packaging. The garments hit the floor in limp piles, revealing the girls' barely clothed bodies. Just jean shorts and bikini tops were covering them. The warehouse lights glared down on their skin, sterile and unflinching.

Each girl stood stiff as a statue. Eyes shut tight, arms locked at their sides like it might protect them, or maybe because they‚Äôd been told not to move. Their bodies trembled slightly in the chill, but they didn‚Äôt make a sound.

And then I saw them.

Really saw them.

The green-skinned girl was the first to break my sense of disbelief. Her hair was writhing, coiling. At first, I thought it was some kind of clever prop, but my blood chilled when I now got a better look. Each strand of her hair was alive, wriggling independently like it had its own mind.

Snakes! Her hair was made of snakes!

They hissed and coiled, agitated, though she stood perfectly still. Her skin wasn‚Äôt painted. It was smooth, lime-colored, patterned faintly with scales that shimmered under the fluorescent lights. Her pupils were vertical slits, and I swear‚Äîwhen she opened her eyes for a flicker of a second‚Äîshe looked directly at me.

The red-skinned girl beside her was slightly taller, her horns curling back over her head like ram's horns, polished and dark. Her skin was a muted crimson, not firetruck red but more like old blood. There was something subtly wrong with the air around her, like heat shimmered off her body even though it was cold. Her expression was blank, distant, but her lips parted slightly, showing two elongated canines.

She had to be a succubus.

The aquatic girl, blue as sea glass, stood next to her. Her skin had a faint iridescence, and her collarbones bore subtle ridges where her gills fluttered, as if testing the air. Her eyes were wide and silver-flecked, and her feet, fully webbed, shifted on the concrete like she didn‚Äôt know how to stand upright for long. She had long, elaborate dark blue hair that cascaded down her back. She looked... newer. Less hardened. Her arms were mostly human, but around her elbows the scales thickened, hinting at something underneath that didn‚Äôt belong on land.

She looked a lot like a mermaid, only with legs.

And then there was the third woman, the fairy.

God, she looked fragile. And she was so small. She had to be no taller than five feet. The kind of thin that suggested she hadn‚Äôt eaten in weeks. Her skin was a cold shade of ivory with almost runic veins etched all over her body in elaborate patterns. Her mouth was clamped shut, but when she turned slightly, I caught a glimpse of her wings. They were long, slender, not the cartoonish kind, but real, elaborate and elegant. Her normally happy expression was absent, replaced by a cold, gaunt look.

One of the men walked up behind them and began fastening black zip ties around their wrists; tight, unforgiving. He moved mechanically, as though binding exotic animals for transport. He looped their ankles with chains, thin enough to walk in, thick enough to control. The girls flinched at the contact but said nothing. The succubus winced as the plastic bit into her wrists. The mermaid‚Äôs eyes welled slightly, but the tears didn‚Äôt fall.

Then the man did something that made my blood run cold.

He slapped the gorgon across the ass, hard. The sound echoed through the empty lot like a gunshot. She didn‚Äôt react. She didn‚Äôt cry out or turn her head. But I saw the snakes recoil violently, hissing, writhing with fury she couldn‚Äôt show.

The men herded them deeper into the warehouse like livestock.

I just sat there, trying to process what the fark I was seeing.

Because in that moment, one horrifying thought lodged deep in my skull:

These girls weren‚Äôt just being trafficked.

They weren‚Äôt even human.

My fingers were frozen on the steering wheel, heart pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. My brain was screaming at me to call someone. Anyone! But who the hell would believe me? Hey, officer, I just watched four mythological monster girls get taken into a warehouse at the center of the city.

Yeah, because 911 wouldn‚Äôt tell me not to tie up the line.

As they were led further inside, the light grew dimmer. The warehouse swallowed them, but not entirely. A single floodlight buzzed overhead, casting a broad yellow cone over a low, makeshift couch positioned just beyond the bay entrance‚Äîcobbled together from old cushions and tarp-covered padding. It looked like something torn from a brothel or holding cell. Stained. Improvised.¬†*Used*.

The girls were sat there in a silent row, facing the lot. Facing¬†*me*.

I sank lower in my seat, heart pounding again. From the shadows of the junked patrol cars, wedged between a rusted pickup and a hollowed-out school bus, I prayed they couldn‚Äôt see me.

But something told me they could.

The men who brought them in moved to the back of the warehouse. One flipped a switch. The bay doors began to roll shut with a slow metallic groan, but they stopped just shy of closing completely. Maybe five or six feet off the ground. Enough to let in air. Or maybe to let something else out.

Then they left the girls alone.

And in the silence that followed, the girls sat motionless‚Äîlike artifacts on display, too exhausted to cry and too hopeless to run. Their heads drooped, and their limbs, still bound, trembled subtly. Some stared at nothing. Others scanned the warehouse‚Äôs rusted walls with the expression of someone already dreaming of escape.

Then, all at once, their eyes locked with mine.

It was almost imperceptible. No sudden movement. No gasp. Just a shift subtle, mechanical, instinctive‚Äîas their eyes aligned with mine. As if they‚Äôd known I was there. It wase the whole time. As if they‚Äôd been¬†*waiting*.

Their gazes didn‚Äôt move from me. They didn‚Äôt dare turn their heads, didn‚Äôt twitch or gesture or alert their handlers. They stayed perfectly still, communicating only through their eyes. A look passed between them, brief, but barely perceptible. Then back to me.

And what I saw in their expressions wasn‚Äôt malice or hunger.

It was¬†*grief*. Unfiltered, soul-flattening¬†*grief*. The kind you don‚Äôt fake.

The gorgon girl sat with her knees pressed tightly together, her wrists zip-tied behind her back, shoulders curled forward like she was trying to hide her form. Her snakes no longer moved‚Äîthey hung limp, defeated, as if they, too, had been broken. Her green skin was mottled now, blotched along her arms and thighs, and there were bruises and deep purple welts just below her bikini line. Her eyes locked on mine. And behind them, desperation.

The succubus looked older. Not by years, but by mileage. Her light red skin shimmered faintly under the light, not glittery but¬†*raw*, like an open wound healing over. Her horns curved back like polished obsidian, beautiful but scarred‚Äîone chipped at the base, like it had been cracked with a blunt instrument. Her chest was bound by a fraying bikini top that looked too tight, clearly not designed for comfort. Her lips moved slightly, whispering something I couldn‚Äôt hear.

The mermaid girl sat with her legs drawn up, feet tucked beneath her. Her blue-scaled skin looked drier than before, as though the air was hurting her. The edges of her gills twitched, struggling to take in oxygen, and her chest rose and fell rapidly. Her bikini top was damp in places, stained with something that didn‚Äôt look like water. There were red rings around her wrists, deeper than the others, like she'd struggled the most. Her silver eyes welled with tears that never fell.

And the fairy girl‚Ä¶

She sat straight-backed, as if posture was all she had left. Her legs were crossed at the ankles, but the chain dug into her skin, leaving little bloody half-moons. Her skin was paler than the others, almost translucent now, the veins beneath glowing faintly blue in the dark. Her eyes, glimmering like diamonds, glinted as they found mine. She looked at me the longest.

It wasn‚Äôt hunger. It was¬†*recognition*. Like she knew who I was. Or had known someone like me once. And still, I didn‚Äôt move. A part of me¬†*wanted*¬†to. To leap from the car and scream at the men, alert law enforcement, rush in there with a tire iron like some kind of bargain-bin savior. But another part, deeper, colder, hesitated.

Because I¬†*knew*¬†things. I‚Äôd read the stories. The reports. The conspiracy threads.

Succubi don‚Äôt need consent. They drain you while you sleep. Medusas turn men to stone‚Äîsometimes only from the waist down. And mermaids? The old kind, the¬†*real*¬†kind? Much of mythology says they pulled sailors into the deep just to watch them drown. And lastly, not all fairies were benevolent.

These women could have lured dozens to their deaths. Maybe more. Could I really afford to take my chances? But if that was true, if these weren‚Äôt victims but predators..

Then who were¬†*those men*?

I glanced back at the warehouse. No insignias. No badges. No containment gear. Just gloves and zip ties. Who do they work for anyway?

If they were from the SCP Foundation, or the Global Occult Coalition, or whatever black-budget monster-hunting agency the internet whispered about, why were they¬†*here*¬†of all places? Why a rotting warehouse off I-95 in the industrial epicenter of North Miami? Why not a deep-sea lab or some forest bunker where no one could see? It didn‚Äôt make sense. But it was more reason to believe that this wasn‚Äôt containment. It was commerce.

And I had a suspicion as to precisely what kind.

My hands moved before my conscience could catch up. I pulled out my phone, my heart was still pounding, and didn‚Äôt even bother opening Google. This wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd find on Yelp.

So, I downloaded Tor. Because whatever those girls were, they weren‚Äôt the only ones being sold. And I guarantee you I wouldn‚Äôt have found them anywhere else.

Within minutes, I was browsing the dark web and it wasn‚Äôt long before I discovered the classifieds. I wont go into detail of what else I came across, just know I found what I was looking for.

It surprisingly did not take too long. Within minutes I was browsing escorts on an exclusive dark web form. And I found women of various ‚Äòexotic‚Äô subspecies on a website not normally accessible on google. They had fairies, pixies, succubae, harpies, and even the bird-like sirens all available for ‚Äòrent‚Äô on their site. They have clients of all kinds, ranging from human to non-human.

Confirmed.

My only question was, if they were being trafficked from other dimensions or worlds, then it would stand to reason that some kind of government agency would be watching stuff like this. Getting curious, I decided to look up the instructions needed to ‚Äòbook‚Äô a session.

But before I could type a single letter, something happened.

A low mechanical whine filled the air outside my vehicle, coming from across the lot. I looked up from the phone to turn my gaze immediately upon the warehouse. I saw the door yawning open. Thick shadows peeled away as halogen lights spilled out from within. And there they were.

The girls. All four of them. Led out in single file, like livestock.

The two men from before‚Äîheavyset, pale-skinned, wearing nondescript utility jackets‚Äîushered them forward with quick, mechanical hand gestures. I could hear faint commands muffled through the air: ‚ÄúKeep your eyes down.‚Äù ‚ÄúMove.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo noise.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt need to threaten. The girls were already broken in.

Each of them was bound now. Not just zip ties around their wrists like before, but full restraints‚Äîankles shackled together with thick, black iron cuffs, arms trussed behind their backs with heavy leather belts. And this time‚Ä¶ each one had a¬†**ball gag**¬†strapped into their mouths, tightly enough that their cheeks bulged and their breathing rasped through their nostrils.

Their outfits‚Äîif you could even call them that‚Äîwere degraded even further. Small bikini tops stretched taut across their chests, barely covering anything. Short shorts clung to their hips like afterthoughts, riding high between their thighs. They weren‚Äôt costumes anymore. They were¬†*uniforms*. Assigned. Dehumanizing.

The¬†**gorgon woman**¬†walked at the front. Her green skin shimmered slightly under the fluorescent light, and her snake-hair writhed weakly, like it had been sedated. Her eyes scanned the area as she walked, darting left and right in brief jerks. She looked for an escape route, maybe. I watched her gaze pass over the lot. And then, it hit my car. Her pupils sharpened. Locked. Our eyes met.

Behind her, the¬†**succubus**¬†shuffled forward, her crimson skin marked with bruises along her ribs. Her horns had been shaved down since I last saw her. Roughly. Unevenly. A punishment, maybe. Her tail twitched behind her like it was trying to hide.

The¬†**mermaid girl**¬†walked in stiff, halting steps, her webbed toes curled in shame. Her gills flared weakly with each shallow breath, irritated from the dry air. She winced with every step, like the asphalt burned her feet.

The fairy, or nymph-like girl was the last to be loaded. She was tiny‚Äîno taller than 4‚Äô11, but the way she moved, the way her body trembled with each step, she looked even smaller. Fragile. Breakable. Her translucent wings had been cruelly pinned‚Äîfolded tight against her back beneath a leather harness that pressed down hard, the wing joints visibly strained and twitching under the weight. Every few seconds, they fluttered instinctively, as if trying to open, only to be jerked back down by the restraint.

They were loaded into a large white truck again‚Äîsame model as before, only now without the subtlety. The rear doors were wide open, revealing a padded interior with low red lights, a bench lining either side, and steel rings bolted to the walls‚Äîanchor points

One by one, the girls were pushed up the small ramp and chained inside. The doors slammed shut with the finality of a tomb.

I made a decision.

I threw my phone into the passenger seat and turned the key in the ignition. I didn‚Äôt care about the form anymore. I needed to¬†*know*¬†where they were going. I pulled out slowly, keeping three car lengths behind the truck as it rolled out of the warehouse lot and onto the main road. I killed my headlights.

The city was quiet at this hour, nothing but low neon glows and the occasional flicker of a crosswalk sign. The truck didn‚Äôt move fast. Like it had no fear of being followed.

It took me less than ten minutes to realize where they were going.

**The Strip is just outside the Miami International Airport.**

A ring of sleazy motels, gas stations, hourly-rate rooms, and concrete towers baking under yellow-orange streetlamps. I passed a billboard advertising ‚ÄúFantasy Island Spa‚Äù and another offering discounted ‚Äúcompanionship services.‚Äù Every building seemed to lean sideways with mildew and regret.

The truck pulled into the back lot of a one-story motel that didn‚Äôt even bother hiding its purpose. No signs. No lights. Just faded brick and boarded-up windows. The kind of place where you checked in through a thick glass slot and never asked for towels.

I parked again, this time behind a shuttered laundromat across the street. I watched the men open the back doors to the truck.

First came the¬†**gorgon woman**¬†again. Still at the front. Her feet dragged as they pulled her out by the arm. She tried to resist, but her shackled legs gave her no leverage. One of the men¬†*shoved*¬†her forward, and she fell hard onto the gravel, the gag making a wet, choking thud against her lips. She whimpered. A sound I could barely hear but¬†*felt*¬†in my teeth.

The snakes on her head twitched frantically, like they were trying to fight back. Two men got out of the vehicle and hoisted her up. She walked gingerly on two feet barely covered with sandals, the two men guiding her up the paved sidewalk.

The motel itself met every definition of ‚Äòseedy‚Äô you could think of. It was only one story, and the building itself couldn‚Äôt have had more than a dozen rooms carved into it. The overhead sign was gone, and the neon-lit vacancy light was only half lit. A single row of doors lit by flickering amber bulbs that hummed with bugs

The faded green paint peeling like sunburned skin and security bars warped from age or misuse. The overhead sign was gone, torn off or collapsed long ago. Only a skeletal frame remained, rusted through and straining against the wind. Beneath it, a busted neon¬†*VACANCY*¬†light glowed half-lit and stuttering, casting the letters¬†*V-A-C-C-Y*¬†across the parking lot like a joke no one was in on. The place looked like it was functional, but barely.

I saw them take the gorgon woman to one of the doors, I faintly made out the number 12 just above as the door opened and she was escorted inside. I looked back down at my phone, and reopened the Tor browser. My eyes went to the unnamed website where I found the escort services. I adjusted my location accordingly to Miami.

I waited a few minutes.

And then, I found her. It was the gorgon woman. I texted the number below. I waited a few more minutes before I got a response. The reply came in a green text bubble. Simple. Too simple.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

That was it. There was no name or greeting. Just a blunt set of instructions. It felt less like an invitation and more of a transaction.

I stared at the message for a while. My thumb hovered over the screen. A part of me kept waiting for a second reply. Or a clarification. Or maybe even a joke, but that was wishful thinking at this point. I wanted a reason not to go in there, and there were too many to list. I wanted to believe that the gorgon lady wanted to eat me, or turn me into stone. But I just couldn‚Äôt.

I glanced back across the street.

Room 12 was dark again, the window light had been clicked off. The only thing marking it from the other rooms was the faint, uneven scrawl of the number above the door, its paint chipping off.

The parking lot was still empty. No cars, pedestrians or other signs of life, except for a single curtain twitching in one of the rooms further down the row. I didn‚Äôt like that. Someone was watching. Or something was. I sat back in the seat and tried to breathe, but my lungs were tight.

This wasn‚Äôt curiosity anymore. Not really. It was something colder, heavier. Like I‚Äôd seen too much already, and now I wasn‚Äôt¬†*allowed*¬†to look away. No. I¬†*couldn‚Äôt*¬†look away.

I stared at the message again.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

I took a deep breath and exited my vehicle, making my way across the street and to the motel. I walked up to door number 12. I knocked twice. I technically was a brown belt in BJJ and had light striking skills with taekwondo, so in that department I had some kind of plan should someone want to get physical with me.

After a few minutes, the door slowly opened, and the gorgon woman looked up at me. I saw that she was covered in a silky smooth, see-through bathrobe. She tucked a few snakes behind her ear as she let off a meek, yet nervous smile.

‚ÄúPlease come in.‚Äù

I nodded as she took my hand and guided me into the room. Her hand was cold.

Her 5‚Äô2 frame he gently guided my 5‚Äô10 self to the bed. The snakes coiled behind her ear twitched once more as if whispering something I wasn‚Äôt meant to hear.

The door shut behind me with a soft click that sounded louder than it should have in the silence. The room was dimly lit, only by a bedside lamp with a cracked shade. The air was thick with a strange mix of scents: cheap rosewater, stale sweat, and perfume that had a rosy, yet pungent odor. It was inviting, yet it stung my nostrils.

There was no music, or TV. Only the sounds of her and my breathing filled the room.

She gently sat me down on the bed an stood over me. She then very slowly undid the sash, dropping it to the floor, letting the robe fall open. She was wearing a tight-fitting thong and a bra. It wasn‚Äôt long before I noticed the cuts, bruises and welts along her body. Her eyes were heavy.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

She forced a smile and nodded, then straddling me on the bed. She begun to ravish my neck, purring like a kitten.

‚ÄúSo strong. So handsome.‚Äù She giggled.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have sex.‚Äù

She then looked at me like I killed ten people. I then picked her up and gently laid her on the bed. She sat up to look at me as I sat down next to her.

‚ÄúCan we‚Ä¶ talk?‚Äù

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúTalk?‚Äù

I nodded.

Her eyes went wide as she pressed her fingers to her temple. ‚ÄúT-talk? You w-want to-you want to talk?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúTo get to know you better.‚Äù

Her eyes widened as she just stared at me like I was the president of the United States.

‚ÄúNobody has ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶.‚Äù she stammered, and then shook her head. ‚ÄúIm not allowed to answer questions.‚Äù

I then heard a pounding on the door.

‚ÄúAlina! You better not be telling anyone anything about us!‚Äù she heard someone scream.

‚ÄúOh no. He sounds drunk.‚Äù She raved, and then turned to me. ‚ÄúYou need to-‚Äù

The door slammed open and a tall man about my height came out.

‚ÄúYou! Outside! Me and the lady need to have a little talk.‚Äù

I glanced at the gorgon woman. Now the fresh tears were streaming down her face as she clutched the blanket from the bed to her chest.

I got up from the bed, frozen and I just stared at the man, my stupid neurodivergence not knowing what to do.

‚ÄúAre you deaf?! Leave now!‚Äù he then stormed over to me.

His breath hit my face, sour and hot, as he grabbed a fistful of my collar. My brain lagged for a split second, choking on the sudden pressure, the shouting, the chaos.

And then everything snapped into place. I didn‚Äôt think‚ÄîI¬†*reacted*. I went for a straight body lock, my hips turning, and I drove him backwards off his balance, tackling him hard onto the dirty motel floor with a hollow¬†*THUMP*¬†that shook the lampshade.

The moment he went to the ground, I immediately got into position wrapping my legs around one of his. He tried to scramble, but I was already repositioning.

I grabbed his leg, controlled the heel, dropped my weight sideways, and twisted. Fast. Brutal. A perfect heel hook. There was a pop. Then a scream. High-pitched, animal, involuntary.

He flailed, slamming his fists on the floor, howling in raw, guttural pain as his knee exploded under the torque. I moved over to his head and executed an anaconda choke around his neck. He was out cold in seconds.

I stood, chest heaving.

The gorgon woman was still on the bed, shaking, her snakes hissing low and defensive around her face like a living halo. But she was staring at me differently now, with widened eyes filled with awe and admiration.

‚ÄúYou-‚Äù she stuttered. ‚Äú-You fought for me.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI guess I did what anyone would do.‚Äù

She let off a slight smirk, looking up at me like a lost child who just found her mother. She let out a breath that was almost a laugh, and a small, trembling smile curled at her lips.

I turned to her, helping her off the floor. ‚ÄúAlina, we don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äù

She took my hand slowly, like she was afraid she‚Äôd wake up if she moved too fast. Her fingers were cold and delicate, but they gripped mine like she didn‚Äôt want to let go, a light smirk playing on her lips.

I peaked out the door. I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Then I turned back to Alina.

‚ÄúCan you walk?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù She then winced. Her balance swayed as she stood, her hand slapping against the wall to steady herself.

‚ÄúThen we‚Äôre leaving. Right now.‚Äù

We stepped out into the heavy, damp night air. The parking lot was still empty‚Äîno headlights, no engines, no sign of the other traffickers. We both emerged from the room. But she was still wobbly, holding onto the doorframe for support. I turned back to her.

‚ÄúUgh. My head.‚Äù She said holding a hand to her head.

Without thinking, I moved back to her, and swept her up into my arms. She was lighter than I expected‚Äîlike she was made of silk and bone and smoke. Her arms instinctively wrapped around my neck, her face resting just under my chin. I felt her breath on my collarbone. Soft, yet Shaky. The snakes on her head curled quietly, docile now, like they too had calmed.

After a few steps, I felt her shift slightly in my arms.

‚ÄúYou smell like‚Ä¶ laundry detergent,‚Äù she murmured, voice barely audible.

I tilted my head. ‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ that a bad thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ warm,‚Äù she said, slightly giggling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre warm.‚Äù

I glanced down. Her cheeks had gone faintly pink, and she was staring up at me, eyelids heavy. That little smile returned, slightly drowsy, but undeniably real. Something soft bloomed between us, buried beneath the fear and bruises and neon motel lights.

As we walked over to the car, she reached up with her hand to trace my jawline, her touch featherlight‚Äîlike she wasn‚Äôt sure I was solid. Her smile brightened, a flicker of something radiant breaking through the haze of everything she'd endured.

I opened the passenger door for her. She hesitated only a moment before slipping in, curling up against the seat like it was the first real rest she‚Äôd had in days. Maybe weeks. As I pulled away from the laundromat, the silence in the car felt different. Not empty. Just‚Ä¶ full of things we couldn‚Äôt say yet.

The cite rolled past in blurred halos of orange and blue. Traffic lights blinked on empty corners. Planes cut across the sky far overhead, heading to places that still felt like fiction to people like us. Every now and then, I could feel her eyes on me. Watching. Studying. Not in fear, but in curiosity. Like she was trying to memorize me. Each time I glanced over, she‚Äôd quickly look away, but not before I caught the edge of a smile playing on her lips.

Outside, the streets of Miami drifted by, quiet and gleaming with midnight sheen. But inside that car, something had changed. This wasn‚Äôt a rescue anymore. It wasn‚Äôt survival.

It was the start of something else.

Something far more nefarious than a local escort ring.

I pulled into the quiet suburban street just after 2:00 a.m. The neighborhood was still, with only the hum of distant sprinklers and the occasional wind chime from a neighbor‚Äôs porch disturbed the silence. The house sat near the end of the cul-de-sac. I always found some comfort in its symmetry allowing me a clear view of the whole circle.

I parked in the driveway, shut off the engine, and turned to Alina. She was asleep the whole ride, her head resting against the passenger window.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here.‚Äù I said flatly.

She got up and opened her eyes. Her snakes twitched softly under the dome light.

I got out and opened the passenger side door for her, offering my hand. She looked up at me tenderly, her snakes hissing quietly, sniffing my hand with their forked tongues. She reached up and took it with a smirk, fluttering her eyes up at me as she stumbled out of the vehicle and onto her feet.

She winced once when her bare foot touched the concrete, but she said nothing. Her arms clung to mine as they moved, probably still getting over the effects of the drugs. She gradually, however, regained her footing.

Inside, the house smelled faintly of lavender fragrances and books. The kind of place that held warmth in the walls and memories in the carpet. It was a typical suburban home.

‚ÄúMy dads in New York with his fianc√©e,‚Äù I explained, leading her down the hall. ‚ÄúAnd my mom‚Äôs in Texas visiting my aunt. I‚Äôm house-sitting. Keeping things in shape. Paying rent. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say a word as her eyes went all around the house, quietly taking in the framed photos, the soft lighting, the reality of it all. She looked like she didn‚Äôt know whether to cry or collapse. I stopped at the guest room door and opened it for her.

There was a clean queen-sized bed with folded gray blankets, a small desk, a reading lamp, and a single dresser. But compared to where she'd come from, it might as well have been heaven. She walked in slowly, running her fingers along the blanket, like she was scared it would disappear. Then she turned to me.

""Martin?"" she said softly.

I tilted my head from the doorway. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you‚Ä¶ stay with me?‚Äù Her voice cracked just slightly. ‚ÄúJust for tonight. I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to be alone.‚Äù

I hesitated for a beat. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to‚Äîbut because of the way she looked up at me. From her 5'2 height, tilted her chin, her golden-green eyes wide and shimmering under the soft hallway light. Her snakes curled slightly inward, almost bashful, like they were reflecting her nervousness

I rubbed the back of my neck. ‚ÄúOh-Ok.‚Äù

She smiled, an actual, genuine smile, gleaming pearly whites. The tension in her shoulders dropped. She climbed onto the bed slowly, curling up near the pillows but leaving space beside her.

I slowly sauntered over and sat down at the edge of the bed, unsure of what to do. I felt awkward, towering beside her, my 5'11 frame making the bed dip slightly. But she didn‚Äôt seem to mind. If anything, she scooted closer.

‚ÄúAre you gonna lie down?‚Äù she pouted, looking up at me with longing eyes.

I nodded, then slowly rested next to her. She immediately snuggled up next to me and buried her face in my neck, wrapping her arm around my torso. She curled gently into my side. I could feel her smiling and giggling

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre warm.‚Äù she purred.

I looked down at her, and then really noticed how delicate, yet beautiful she looked under the lamplight. Bruised, but strong. Shaken, but resilient. And‚Ä¶ Jesus Christ she was gorgeous.

I just reached over and pulled the blanket up around us both and killed the light. Her breathing slowed. Her snakes finally went still.

I laid back with her, letting the silence wrap around us like another layer of warmth.

And just before sleep pulled her under, she murmured, almost inaudibly:

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it.‚Äù I half smiled.

And in the dark, with her hand on my chest and her cheek against his shoulder, she finally closed her eyes. I did too.

That was probably the best sleep I have had in a while.",1,1758508306.0,Odd_directions,1,0.67,False

Her reason: she felt emotionally dependent on me, couldn‚Äôt go more than a few days without seeing me, and needed space to figure herself out.

It was a respectful breakup no drama, just love and best wishes. I gave her the space she wanted, cut contact, and focused on myself. Since then I‚Äôve been to therapy, learned about our attachment styles, crushed it at work, and traveled a lot. I‚Äôve grown a ton.

Four months after the breakup she reached out to return a few of my things. I kept it short: just grabbed my stuff, no small talk. Recently, I‚Äôve noticed little signals that make me wonder if she still feels something.

Now I‚Äôm debating asking her for coffee. My goal isn‚Äôt to rehash the past but to get clarity: does she see a future, or is it 100% done? Living with the uncertainty has been draining.

1nnapic,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1nnapic/dream_job_might_be_out_of_reach_for_autistic/,Dream job might be out of reach for autistic adult. Advice please,"Hello y'all. This is a long one. Tldr below. 

I 25(F) have run into something of a realization regarding how I am treated at work places and I need some advice. For relevance I was diagnosed with Asperger's at the age of 8 but I wasn't told until I was 17. Additionally I am one of 6 children and half of us have autism and I am considered high functioning. But I struggle daily with social interactions.

So, ever since I was in third grade I wanted to become a teacher. My teacher was particularly kind to me and I adored her. I grew up never considering another career. As I got older I slowly realized I was a bit different from other kids. I didn't make friends easily but I Velcroed myself to those who stuck around. Again I didn't know I was diagnosed with anything and I suspect that affected how I saw myself growing up.

Some background.

I have worked at multiple childcare types of jobs. My favorite was a boy scout merit badge director. I also had an internship at a planetarium where I did ""star talks"" essentially I got free range on the sky dome and got to teach the audience about anything I wanted for 15 minutes before a show. I also worked at a very popular coffee shop for nearly 4 years before leaving for this current job opportunity.

This new job stretched me unlike any experience I have ever had before. And it has been extremely difficult to not just up and quit. 
I may have met my breaking point. This job started out confusing. I applied for an assistant position and they offered me the full lead teacher position for their summer camp at a private school. I accepted since it sounded similar to the boy scout position. I was ecstatic. 

I started my first day and had the lead preschool person come to me asking what I had planned for preschool. I panicked for a second because I was in charge of watching and teaching the 5 year olds and older. I was told not to teach preschool but apparently I missed where they wanted me to PLAN preschool.

By some grace of God I panicked for about 5 minutes and came up with some lesson plan right out of my butt and handed it to her with the materials out of the supply room and all was well.

I came to realize I had expectations I wasn't told about before hand OR it was something I didn't understand fully when they described it to me originally. Sometimes I need absolute ""Explain it to me like I'm 5 years old"" instructions when I enter something new. I was cooked.

After the initial misunderstanding I started doing all the things people came to me for but I had a few parent interactions that were very hard. Eventually the summer was ending and I was excited to start a new, less demanding, position at the school.
They offered me an assistant nursery position so I took it and we had a meeting about what to expect a week before it started. 
They asked about my experience and I said I had more experience with children 2-4 than 0-1. So I was placed in the toddler room. 
I asked for a detailed job description this time to avoid the misunderstandings from the last position. I never received it. I had a week to plan for the new room but I didn't know what they wanted me to plan for. I emailed about what criteria I needed to match for preschool readiness and asked why I hadn't received the day schedule for the children.
I got a rather blunt and almost short tempered email back that basically said they don't have the information yet. I wasn't sure what to do. So I had to completely make up a day schedule and made a weeks of lesson plans in just two days. I ended up using chat gpt for a few things since I had literally no idea what to do.

Why would it be up to a brand new associate graduate to be responsible for the actual CREATION of an entire program in less than a week? I got an email back around this time about how the preschool teachers would visit me in the end of our second week to discuss what I should teach? Two weeks late?
So they come and it's just.. week one ""all about me"" week 2 ""my name"" and literally no other information.
I thankfully remembered a lot of the stuff from school being expected of this age group like teaching how to hold a pencil, name, color, shape and size recognition. Fine and gross motor play. Potty training, etc.
But I felt strange that none of these things were even brought up in this discussion. 

Now, this is the part where I need advice. Now that I have been in the position for about a month I have wanted to quit since week 2. I feel like the main boss stopped liking me since I have ""failed"" to meet their outrageous criteria for what was originally supposed to be an assistant position. But I am all by myself in a separate room from the other nursery staff with seven 2 year olds. For 9 hours. mon-fri. I've had a parent who also works at the school complain about me for not changing her daughter on time. I've heard other things but she's the only one who has ever said anything to me. She was upset her daughter hadn't been changed yet even though it wasn't time on my daily schedule to change the children and she came 20 minutes early. I felt it was unfair. She has since complained about me to my boss and honestly I'm over working here.
I had a talk with my boss where I wanted to bring up all the miscommunications I've experienced working there and all she said was that I need to do better. That I am not socializing well enough with the children. 

That hit me hard. I realized my ability to socialize was actually the reason my boss was distancing herself from me. I also saw online a few weeks ago my position at the school was posted to hire. Which I thought was weird but this place was slow for everything so I didn't think much of it. But then I was told at this meeting that they were already conducting interviews for ""another person for the toddler room"". They didn't say assistant. The posting was for my position.
With all this I am good and done with this place. But I feel I may not be cut out for being a teacher. I have learned it has incredibly long hours, a ton of social challenges and without a strong support system I'm incapable of keeping up.

I never thought my social skills wouldn't be enough for the one thing I wanted to do in life. And this isn't the first place to have mentioned having trouble with my.. lack of abilities.
Granted I know I have grown a lot since having multiple jobs but maybe I should try another career path? Perhaps one with clearer expectations and more balanced responsibilities.
I want to leave as soon as possible without burning this bridge. How can I salvage this?

T.L.D.R. I want to leave my dream job because my social skills may not live up to workplace expectations. And it has been horrible with communication and has blamed me for what I believe is their short coming. Also I want to leave this job without burning any bridges but I'm at my wits end.",5,1758507995.0,autism,4,1.0,False

I haven't played many immersive sims (OG Deus Ex, Cruelty Squad, Dishonored 1 - Cruelty Squad's the only one I outright enjoyed through and through) and based off of that video, I was expecting the game to end up easily turning into a fun power fantasy with unique, cool powers and weapons like turning into objects, blasting enemies with psychic attacks, and grenades that recycle objects and enemies into materials to gain resources to make more upgrades and gain even more powers easily. Unfortunately, Prey 2017 was in fact *not* that, and was in reality a survival much more survival horror-oriented, with resources always being scarce and choices being deliberately hamstrung by said scarcity as to force decision making and problem solving.

What are games that ACTUALLY fulfill what I wanted from Prey 2017: a game that doesn't restrict your resource usage, lets you use a bunch of cool, unique powers that are fun to use, and can be broken very easily? I love the idea of turning into a coffee mug and vaporizing an enemy who looks and breathes in your direction with an explosive mind blast, but as far as I know, Prey is the only game that lets you do something like that, albeit by consuming a heavy amount of psi that can't be replenished easily, and I haaaaaate that. If failing even that, something that just lets me destroy enemies with brute force or style. Also, the recommendations don't have to be limited to immersive sims or even FPSes, though action-oriented games are preferred.

Roommate not as clean as I had thought was ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù,"For some background, I am married and live with my husband and his sister/my sister-in-law in a two bedroom apartment. For the sake of clarity, I will simply refer to her as a roommate.

I grew up in a very Asian household. Cleanliness was everything. I was put to clean a lot of things when I had free time. I learned at a very early age how to tolerate the harshness of bleach safely. I carried everything I learned about cleaning into adulthood and I pride myself in staying clean and organized.

I married a man who I knew does not have the same knack for cleanliness that I do. We‚Äôve had many arguments about it, but now he‚Äôs at the point where I don‚Äôt have to police him about leaving a mess. Things have been harmonious since then. I learned he is not the only one guilty of being less conscious of cleanliness when I started living with him and his sister.

To anyone curious, no, I did not consent to living all together in the same apartment. I found out that this would be the arrangement a bit too late before we signed the lease, and I haven‚Äôt had the heart to throw her out because she‚Äôs actually a good person (though I have made it final we will be getting our own place when our lease ends).

So unfortunately, his sister is not great at cleaning up unless there is company coming over. Any time she uses the kitchen to make coffee or food, I will always find residue of sauces, powders, and liquids on the counter. I have seen the fridge with her old expired food in the back with visible mold and sticky remnants of drinks slightly spilled. Shit, I‚Äôve seen a nearly empty bag of potato chips on the floor near the door to her room that started attracting ANTS.

She has sent me into her room once to retrieve something for her, and it is‚Ä¶a mess. Bear in mind we are all past our mid-20s.

In general, with our shared living spaces, she has the habit of leaving out dishes (sometimes for days on end) and leaving crumbs/small trash pieces on the floor to just be.

This is all very striking to me because my mother would have sent me straight to hell had I left my dishes on the table after a meal. I get most of my cleaning is out of trauma, but at least I‚Äôm not messy.

I acknowledge I‚Äôm not perfect either. I walk with shoes on in our apartment sometimes, and take my bike in and out without a worry, but all because I know I have every other Sunday to look forward to mopping the floor‚Ä¶which she has never offered to do. Or any deep cleaning of the kitchen or patio for that matter.

PART I","I don‚Äôt know if writing this down will make any difference, but I need to get this out. Somewhere. Anywhere. I just finished my first month at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern, a well known prestigious white shoe firm in downtown Brickell. I remember the interview like it was yesterday. It happened in a upscale resort in downtown Miami. They offered me a gargantuan salary, unbelievable benefits, and even a luxury vehicle. It was too good to be true.

But before everything went to hell, it started the way all good fairy tales do.

In a penthouse suite. A perk for working at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern.

I was standing in front of a full-length mirror in our bedroom fit for royalty, adjusting the lapels of my brand-new suit. Navy blue, crisp, tailored exactly to my short frame. The jacket still smelled faintly like plastic and starch from the department store. My hair‚Äîshort, black, parted neatly at the side‚Äîframed my face in a way I hoped made me look like someone who deserved to be walking into a place like Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern.

I tugged on the cuff of my blouse and tried to picture the week ahead: billable hours, conference rooms, and late nights hunched over documents. All the things I‚Äôd fought for in law school. All the things that were supposed to prove that everything from the volleyball scholarships to the law review, and endless nights of outlines and coffee were worth it.

Behind me, leaning in the bedroom doorway, was my tall, handsome fianc√©e, Derek.

God, Derek. 6‚Äô3, broad shoulders still carrying traces of his college football days. A crisp gray suit that looked like it belonged in GQ. He had the same smile he wore at our wedding just a few months ago. It was confident, easy, the kind of smile that convinced anyone they were exactly where they belonged just by being next to him.

‚ÄúYou look like trouble,‚Äù he said, smirking.

I rolled my eyes, but I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. ‚ÄúTrouble? I‚Äôm starting my first week at one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Brickell. That‚Äôs not trouble, that‚Äôs destiny.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm,‚Äù he said, pushing off the doorframe and crossing the room toward me. ‚ÄúDestiny, trouble. Same thing when you‚Äôre five-foot-one and have fire in your veins.‚Äù He kissed the top of my head, then leaned down so our eyes met in the mirror. ‚ÄúIs my tiny tornado ready to conquer the world?‚Äù

My cheeks burned instantly. He always did that, slipping in that pet name that made me sound both ridiculous and invincible. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me that,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù His reflection grinned back at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre five-one, Jackie. You whirl into people‚Äôs lives, knock them off their feet, and spin right out before they know what hit them. You‚Äôre my little tornado. And today? You‚Äôre about to tear through Brickell.‚Äù

I swatted him in the chest, laughing despite myself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so cheesy.‚Äù

‚ÄúCheesy gets results.‚Äù he said, and bent to kiss me.

On the dresser behind us sat our engagement photo album, spread open to a photo of us under an arch of white roses. It was a public proposal at a private gala. My parents were beaming, and my baby cousin was throwing petals. Derek held me like the world was his to keep. For that moment, I let myself breathe it in. My life was so perfect back then.

Had I known about the secrets that Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern were keeping?

I would have walked out of that penthouse and taken the first plane to Antarctica.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Derek said, slipping his watch onto his wrist. ‚ÄúTrain leaves in fifteen. Don‚Äôt want Miami to think their star recruit is late her first day.‚Äù

I playfully hit him as we walked out that door.

And that was probably the last time I saw him, or my life, in such a positive light.

We left our penthouse at seven sharp, the morning sun bouncing off Biscayne Bay, glittering like someone had scattered diamonds across the water. Derek‚Äôs hand found mine as we walked to the metro station, our steps in sync, the city already humming with movement.

On the platform, he squeezed my hand. ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said, tilting his head down at me, ‚Äúbig bad law firm ready for you?‚Äù

I smirked. ‚ÄúThe question is‚Ä¶am I ready for them?‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my girl.‚Äù

The cart was crowded, but we found a spot near the doors. Business suits, briefcases, the faint buzz of people reciting presentations under their breath. Miami mornings smelled like cologne, coffee, and ambition. It was a small car that alternated between stations. The rail system in downtown Brickell was not at all like it was in New York.

The cart glided into Brickell. There were crowds of people below us as we exited the cart and stepped out into the flow of commuters, the heat already thick in the air.

After a few blocks of walking, we reached two tall skyscrapers that were adjacent to each other.

Derek leaned down, kissed me quick, and nodded toward his building right next to ours. ‚ÄúGo on, Tiny Tornado. Time to make partner before lunch.‚Äù

I grinned, swatting his shoulder softly as we kissed one more time before we both went to different buildings.

Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern loomed ahead of me. A forty-story tower of black glass, the letters¬†*SSS*¬†gleaming in silver near the top. My chest tightened as I walked through the revolving doors into the marble lobby. Everything was polished to a mirror shine, including the floors, pillars, and even the elevator doors.

I caught a glimpse of myself again on the smooth surface of the elevator door. Small frame, neat suit, determined eyes. The elevator ride was silent, the kind where everyone stares at the floor numbers because looking at each other feels like trespassing.

When the doors slid open on the associates‚Äô floor, she was already waiting. Her voice was smooth, clipped, practiced. A woman in her mid-forties stood there, hair hanging loosely past her shoulders, pearl necklace, and a navy suit that probably cost more than my car.

‚ÄúJackie Delgado?‚Äù

She was Marsha Dawes, one of the firm‚Äôs partners. I‚Äôd read about her. Ruthless litigator. Built her reputation eating opposing counsel alive in depositions.

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù I said, forcing a smile and extending my hand.

She shook it briefly, her grip cool and precise as a light smile tugged at her lips. ‚ÄúWelcome to Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. We‚Äôve been expecting you.‚Äù

Her eyes lingered on me, like she was sizing me up for something far more than my r√©sum√©.

And in that moment, standing in the polished hall of one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Miami, I swear something shifted. The way she smiled‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt warm, it wasn‚Äôt welcoming.

It was knowing.

Like she already had plans for me.

‚ÄúCome this way,‚Äù Ms. Dawes said, pivoting on her heels with military precision. Jackie fell into step beside her, heels clicking against the immaculate marble floor.

We moved through a maze of hushed hallways lined with closed office doors. The carpet swallowed sound, the kind of luxury flooring meant to make clients feel as though their secrets were safe here, trapped inside a impenetrable vault, or a marble polished coffin.

Every wall was adorned with carefully chosen artwork, ranging from abstract canvases to impressionist pieces that seemed both meaningless yet expensive. The silence was dense, broken only by the occasional muted phone call or the faint shuffle of papers behind closed doors.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get you set up with your office and introduce you to some of the team.‚Äù Ms. Dawes said, her voice calm, clipped, yet slightly chipper. She walked with her hands clasped lightly in front of her, posture flawless.

I nodded, trying to keep my own steps steady. The sheer scale of the place was daunting, but there was something exhilarating about it too. This was¬†*it*‚Äîeverything I worked toward all my life.

As they walked, Ms. Dawes added, ‚ÄúJust listen, learn, and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions. Everyone here was once in your shoes.‚Äù She glanced sideways at me with a smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes. ‚ÄúAnd remember, Ms. Delgado, the letter you received from Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern was the only one we sent out this year. We wanted you.‚Äù

I blinked. The only one? She opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, Ms. Dawes continued, her voice a notch lower.

‚ÄúHave you selected the vehicle yet? It‚Äôs all part of the onboarding package.‚Äù

I tilted my head. ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ vehicle?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Ms. Dawes said matter-of-factly, as if she were asking whether Jackie had picked out her desk chair. ‚ÄúMost associates choose the firm‚Äôs standard issue‚Äîthis year we‚Äôve partnered with Mercedes. The EQE sedan, electric, top of the line.‚Äù Her lips split into a wide, toothy smile. ‚ÄúThe Mercedes is just one of the many perks you‚Äôll have. You‚Äôll want to look into the options by the end of the week.‚Äù

I was lightheaded. A car? Just handed to me like another piece of office equipment? It seemed surreal. That should have been a glaring red flag. But I was blinded by the casual nonchalant tone inn Marsha‚Äôs voice as the rational part of my brain dulled the reptilian side. It was a white shoe firm, so it wasn‚Äôt too uncommon.

Right?

‚ÄúOf course. Thank you. I‚Äôll look into it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Ms. Dawes replied, her heels clicking a beat faster.

We stopped in front of a door with a gleaming silver plaque. My heart stuttered when she read the engraving:

**Jackie Delgado, Associate**

My name. On an office door. This felt so unreal. Between the Mercedes, my own office, and the starting salary of two hundred and fifty grand, this had to be a fever dream.

Oh how I wish it WAS a fever dream.

Ms. Dawes opened it with a small flourish, stepping aside to let Jackie in. The room was bright, modern, and absurdly spacious compared to the cramped student lounges and libraries she‚Äôd lived in for years. Floor-to-ceiling windows stretched across one wall, revealing a stunning view of the Brickell skyline. The sunlight poured in, bouncing off glass towers, the Miami River below glinting like a ribbon of light.

‚ÄúWelcome to your new domain,‚Äù Ms. Dawes said, allowing the faintest curl of a smile to appear on her lips. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you to get settled. My door is always open if you need anything.‚Äù

I nodded, unable to find my voice, but Ms. Dawes was already striding down the hallway, her figure disappearing around the corner.

My first real office. Not a borrowed cubicle. Not a library desk.¬†*My office.*¬†A tangible symbol of years of sweat, sacrifice, and relentless drive.

I set my bag on the sleek white desk and walked to the window. From here I had a scenic view of the docks and the Biscayne Bay, our condo standing proudly against the horizon. I walked over to the glass, taking in the view. It was incredible.

The hushed atmosphere of the firm. The expensive artwork in the hallways. The quiet efficiency of the staff. The air smelled faintly of citrus polish and money. Everything here spoke of power, prestige, permanence.

I lowered myself into the plush leather chair behind the desk, the seat enveloping her as though it had been waiting for her all along. My gaze swept the room‚Äîthe empty shelves, the spotless desk, the waiting phone.

Why, WHY didn‚Äôt I notice the red flags? Why didn‚Äôt I take my grandfather‚Äôs advice?

I remembered my graduation from the University of Miami, the day I received my JD. Her family in the stands, faces glowing with pride. My father crying happy tears. My sister waving furiously, snapping photo after photo.

And her grandfather.

He had clapped politely, even smiled for the pictures, but his eyes had been‚Ä¶ skeptical. Distant. As if he knew something the rest of them didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too good for places like that,‚Äù he‚Äôd whispered when they hugged. ‚ÄúYou think they want you, Jackie. They don‚Äôt want you. They want what you‚Äôll give up for them. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.‚Äù

I had brushed it off at the time. Old man nerves. Overprotective worry.

But now, sitting in her pristine office with her name on the door, the memory tugged at my chest like a loose thread.

For the rest of that month, my life felt like a dream.

Work was steady, even exciting. Derek and I slipped into a routine: waking together, coffee on the balcony, splitting off into the Brickell crowds, meeting again on the train home. At night, we cooked together or went out with friends, laughing too loud in bars that overlooked the water.

At the firm, I was fed the kind of work every first-year associate gets: client memos, research assignments, and document review. None of it glamorous, but none of it sinister either.

At least, not at first.

‚ÄúOkay, ladies, which one of you is ordering the second bottle?‚Äù Daniela asked, twirling her wine glass in the Brickell caf√© where we always met for lunch.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got depositions this afternoon.‚Äù Sophie groaned, shoving her salad aside. ‚ÄúIf I show up tipsy, Dawes will have my head.‚Äù

Alexa smirked. ‚ÄúPlease. Dawes probably downs two martinis before breakfast.‚Äù

I chuckled, shaking my head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her hear you say that. I swear the walls in that place have ears.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe that bad?‚Äù Daniela asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúHonestly, she‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ helpful. I think she likes me.‚Äù I said managing a light smile.

‚ÄúOf course she does.‚Äù Sophie said, raising her glass in a mock toast. ‚ÄúTop of your class, volleyball star, law review golden girl. What‚Äôs not to like?‚Äù

Alexa leaned in. ‚ÄúI bet it‚Äôs Derek. Six-three, investment banker, looks like he walked out of a cologne ad. She probably thinks if she treats you right, you‚Äôll bring him to the Christmas party.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes, laughing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre terrible.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you love me, Jackie girl!‚Äù Alexa grinned.

The four of us talked about everything from weddings, to work, and Netflix shows. It was all so normal I almost forgot I was still the new girl at the most intimidating firm in Miami. Or that i felt something festering below the surface of my senses.

Almost.

That night, back in my office, I opened another file from Ms. Dawes. It was a standard-looking client binder: trust documents, contracts, corporate registrations, financial statements, and even tax returns.

But the tax ID number had an extra digit. thirteen numbers where there should have been nine.

At first I thought it was a typo. But when I keyed it into the firm‚Äôs system, the entry resolved into a real profile: a hedge fund registered out of‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶¬†*nowhere*.¬†*Yet somewhere.*

The jurisdiction zip code did not match anything I‚Äôd seen. Not offshore havens like the Caymans or Luxembourg. Nothing I could trace. It was just a string of symbols that looked almost mathematical.

No. Mathematical is an understatement. It looked‚Ä¶¬†**mythical.**

I looked up from my screen and closed the file, forcing myself to breathe. It was probably some internal coding system.

The next morning, I found another file. This one looked like a normal investment portfolio. Except the timestamps on the trades were wrong. Yet, they weren‚Äôt. I checked the client bank records and deposition notes.

***They were all recorded. And they confirmed everything I read.***

An account had invested in a defense contractor¬†***the day before***¬†they announced a massive government contract. They bought options in a tech company¬†***hours before***¬†the CEO‚Äôs scandal tanked the stock.

I stared at the dates, the hours, the precision of it. It wasn‚Äôt luck. It wasn‚Äôt even insider trading. It was impossible.

‚ÄúEverything okay in there?‚Äù Daniela‚Äôs voice came through the door, startling me.

I snapped the folder shut. ‚ÄúYeah! Just buried in paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúWelcome to the rest of your life!‚Äù she called back, and I could hear her laughing as she walked down the hall.

Later that week, Dawes dropped another file onto my desk herself.

‚ÄúPreliminary review,‚Äù she said crisply. ‚ÄúFlag anything unusual.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù I smiled weakly, pretending that I DIDN‚ÄôT read what I read or saw what I saw on those hearing and deposition notes.

She started to walk away, then paused. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink anything. Half the work we do is making the impossible look routine.‚Äù

I forced a smile. ‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

When I opened the file, I nearly laughed. It was an account ledger for a small religious foundation. But the foundation‚Äôs charter dated back further than any I‚Äôd seen‚Äîso far back it couldn‚Äôt be real.

And this was when my instincts stopped whispering and¬†***began to scream.***

Clay tablets, Babylonian cuneiform, scanned into the file. The entity had supposedly ‚Äúmerged‚Äù with three different cults over the centuries. They each had their own god, each absorbed seamlessly into the ‚Äúmodern foundation.‚Äù

The current directors had names I didn‚Äôt recognize, except one. A professor I‚Äôd read about in undergrad anthropology. Only he‚Äôd been declared missing in 1997.

But the signature on the audit line looked fresh.

I checked the deposition and hearing letters once more. And my heart fell in my chest upon seeing that said clients¬†***existed.***¬†¬†

I sat back in my chair, pressing my fingers to my temples.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I whispered silently to myself. ‚ÄúIs this supposed to be a prank?‚Äù

I wanted to ask Marsha about it. But she was out that evening. She had to meet a client.

At lunch that Friday, Sophie was venting about a partner‚Äôs demands.

‚ÄúI swear, they think we‚Äôre robots,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDo you know what it‚Äôs like to proof three hundred pages of contracts in six hours?‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like Tuesday.‚Äù Alexa muttered.

I sipped my iced tea, smiling faintly, though my mind wasn‚Äôt in the conversation. I was increasingly unsettled by the files I kept working on. I kept thinking about the numbers in those files, the way they didn‚Äôt add up but still somehow‚Ä¶ resolved.

Or about the zip codes to locations that seemingly didn‚Äôt exist in any physical space. Or about the hearing logs and litigation reports filed with the clerk of courts that proved the existence of clients that were shadowy organizations.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quiet,‚Äù Daniela said suddenly.

I blinked. ‚ÄúJust tired. Long week.‚Äù

Derek texted me later:¬†*Dinner at eight. Wear that red dress I like.*

I smiled, typing back,¬†*Always.*

I didn‚Äôt tell him about the file with the trades, or the cult, or the tax IDs that mapped to places I couldn‚Äôt find. I wanted to believe it was a prank. A mean, cruel hazing ritual my sorority liked to pull with the freshmen.

But that cold feeling settled into my gut. A feeling of mounting dread that raised the pitch in the voice of my instincts higher and higher as I did more legal work.

Each file felt like a pebble dropped into water, ripples spreading quietly, invisibly, until you realized the whole surface had shifted. And by the end of that first month, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was no longer looking at my work.

It was looking at me.

Hey you, moved back here over a couple of years ago. Wouldn't say I'm tied down here. Currently a corporate slave, business girly. Basically sold half my soul ü•π Looks like you too are venturing this hellish landscape. Gotta say, the apps suck here, so that 1% chance the universe does its thing here on Reddit of all places lol. 

Ahhh outside of that, I like to make art and music, cooking, reading, self care, museums, games, chilling with my dog and friends. Rainy days, snow, matcha, anime, nature, sunrises, speak a couple of languages, 21 countries and counting. I like to appreciate the nice moments, leaves changing color, laying on my bed after a billion hours of work, sound of rain on my window, first sip of coffee and moreee.

Looking for my person. A genuine connection with a good guy. My nail tech says I need a sweetie pie, yknow to match my Libra vibes. Not into hook up culture, big drinkers, smokers or sharing hehe. Into pushing myself to be the best version of myself. I like learning, being better. Would be ideal if you're similar in that sense. Empathy, patience, funny, smart, kind, adventurous. The kinda thing where you look at someone and they know what you're thinking. Sharing life with someone, best friend vibes and more if the stars align.

Hit me up if we have things in common, if you think we'd click. PM your asl, and what you're looking for. Ages 28-38. Your pic gets mine, gotta be open to verifying early on. And meeting irl if we click like that. I hope you all find what you're looking for ‚ú®",9,1758507933.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

*Lies a box that's always ringing*

*Where the angels keep on winning*

*And the singers keep on singing*

  
""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" 

To say that phrase took a weight off my shoulders would be the understatement of the century. I'd been working on this mission for well over a year, going over every minute detail with a fine-tooth comb. All those sleepless nights, the mountains of paperwork, the carpal tunnel syndrome from the chalkboard, it was all finally complete. I cried, I won't lie to you. A lot of us did. But we still had work to do. Landing on the moon was only step one, we still had to get Buzz and Neil home after all. After Neil took his famous steps and the boys began their duties, all of us in Houston settled down a bit. The cameras were set up, Walter Cronkite got on air, and it was go time.

  
""How's it looking out there Buzz?"" a voice from behind me said. I turned to see Charles Duke take a long drag of a cigarette from a shaky hand. Duke was one of our CAPCOM guys, and had direct communications with Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.

""Boy, it is something else up here I'll tell you. It is something else"" Aldrin replied. 

""Now keep a hold on yourself Buzz"" Duke said, ""You've only got a few hundred million eyes watching!""

  
A laugh filled the room. Joking was good, especially after how tense the pre-landing atmosphere was. Working on a project like this, you get really attached to its success. Now that Buzz and Niel were out of the landing module, it was time for me to get down to business. I was on the geology team. Doesn't sound groundbreaking, but it was at the time. We only had theories on what we'd find up there. Scientific hypotheses and assumptions are great and all, but they only get you so far. The first step of the surface mission was to collect some lunar dust samples. Once these got back to earth, I was one of the lucky few who got to handle it. With all the excitement over the successful landing, I was a little worried the guys would forget to bring me back any souvenirs. I glanced over at Duke, he was much calmer now. He saw my gaze and nodded.

  
""Alright Niel enough fooling around, make sure you get us that sample"" Duke said

""Roger that"" Armstrong replied. He pulled out his sample bag and collected a chunk of lunar dust. He placed it into his space suit compartment and moved on to his next task. Before I could see Armstrong's next task, the room erupted into applause. I looked up to see that Buzz Aldrin had planted the American Flag on the moon. Boy, that made me patriotic. I wondered what my dad would think. I didn't remember much of him, I was only six when he died. Cut down at Luzon only four days before the war ended. I hadn't thought about my old man in a while, but once I saw that flag flying on the lunar surface, he was all I could think about. After a phone call with President Nixon and a bit of kangaroo hopping on around the moon's craters, the tv cameras cut. Lucky for us in the command center, our cameras kept rolling.

  
""Sorry you missed this dad"" I thought

  
Once the cheers died down, the astronauts went back to finishing their mission objectives.

  
""Hey Buzz, don't forget the Dutch want one of those moon rocks"" Duke relayed. The Dutch ambassador had visited the launch site to give the astronauts messages of good luck from the people of the Netherlands, and one from the Queen herself. All he asked for in return, was a moon rock.

  
""Good call, let me go find a good one for the ambassador"" Aldrin replied.

  
At this point I got up from my desk and made my way to the back of the command center. After so many weeks of high stress, I felt more peace than I had in a long time. I was grabbing another cup of coffee when Duke came up and put his arm around me.

  
""Hell of a thing, isn't it?"" he said

  
""Yeah"" I replied ""Doesn't feel real quite yet""

  
""I'll say"" Duke said, taking another drag of his cigarette, ""The greatest achievement in history. That's what they're saying""

  
""At least they're modest"" I joked. Duke gave a hearty laugh, giving me a pat on the back. He turned around to check in on the astronauts.

  
""Hey Buzz, give me an update will you?"" Duke asked, but he was met with silence. I didn't notice, communication ran into hiccups all the time.

  
""Buzz?"" Duke said again ""Come in Bu-"" he stopped. At this point, I realized the whole room had stopped. You could hear a pin drop. I turned around to see what was going on. I looked up to the screens, and my coffee dropped from my hand. I was so transfixed, I barely even noticed the scalding hot liquid splash my shins.

  
Buzz had picked up a rock for the Dutch ambassador, the largest one around that was still small enough to take back in the lunar module. But the rock had a message. It was written plain as day on its underside:

  
""WE HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE

WE WILL BE HERE AGAIN

6812 6812 6812 6812

SATURN LISTENS

BREAK THE LOOP""

  
It felt like an eternity until anyone moved or spoke. It felt like my brain was on fire, I couldn't think. How do you comprehend the uncomprehensible? What did this mean? My mind was moving at a million miles per hour, when someone spoke.

  
""Is the cable feed off?"" Duke asked, clearly shaken

  
Buzz was silent.

  
""Aldrin, do you copy? Is the cable feed off?"" Duke asked again, agitated

  
""Y-yes sir."" Buzz replied. I could sense the fear in his voice.

  
""Good. Take that specimen back with you but do not say a word about it. Copy? Not a fucking word."" Duke said

  
""Copy"" Buzz replied.

  
Duke took off his headset and put his head in his hands. The room was silent as a crypt. After collecting himself, Duke stood on his desk and addressed the room.

  
""There are only 62 people in this room"" Duke said, a somber tone in his voice, ""Nobody outside of this very room has seen that footage. None of you will say a word of what you saw, understand?""

  
""No!"" a voice shouted. One of the mathematicians protested. ""We can't just keep this quiet!"" she exclaimed.

  
Duke pleaded with her to calm down, but she couldn't. One of the directors ushered the sobbing woman into the hallway. I didn't realize at the time, but looking back on it now, she was never seen again.

  
The room remained silent, but we understood. This was far above all of us. I sat back down at my desk, still unable to grasp what had occurred. I wanted to speak. To Duke, to Buzz, to anyone. But I didn't. I followed my orders to the letter.

  
The astronauts followed their orders to secrecy too. Ever wonder why they look so sullen in their first interviews back on earth? If you held an incomprehensible inscription in your hand, you would too. I was never allowed to see the specimen. None of us were. Rumor was that the CIA confiscated it right out of the module when it splashed down. I left my job at NASA a few months later. I began teaching at my local university, but I could never get that message out of my head.

  
What was it? A warning? A riddle? What did Saturn mean? What about the numbers? Who left this for us? I saw the message in my dreams for weeks. I obsessed over it. I wrote and rewrote the message looking for any hidden meaning but I found nothing. Every night I would look at Saturn through my telescope, staring at the celestial body as if it were a painting. One day, I noticed. On Saturn's north pole, there was a storm. This storm was a hexagon, or closer to a cube. A cube. I fell to my knees. Saturn's cube.

  
A cube.

PART I","I don‚Äôt know if writing this down will make any difference, but I need to get this out. Somewhere. Anywhere. I just finished my first month at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern, a well known prestigious white shoe firm in downtown Brickell. I remember the interview like it was yesterday. It happened in a upscale resort in downtown Miami. They offered me a gargantuan salary, unbelievable benefits, and even a luxury vehicle. It was too good to be true.

But before everything went to hell, it started the way all good fairy tales do.

In a penthouse suite. A perk for working at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern.

I was standing in front of a full-length mirror in our bedroom fit for royalty, adjusting the lapels of my brand-new suit. Navy blue, crisp, tailored exactly to my short frame. The jacket still smelled faintly like plastic and starch from the department store. My hair‚Äîshort, black, parted neatly at the side‚Äîframed my face in a way I hoped made me look like someone who deserved to be walking into a place like Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern.

I tugged on the cuff of my blouse and tried to picture the week ahead: billable hours, conference rooms, and late nights hunched over documents. All the things I‚Äôd fought for in law school. All the things that were supposed to prove that everything from the volleyball scholarships to the law review, and endless nights of outlines and coffee were worth it.

Behind me, leaning in the bedroom doorway, was my tall, handsome fianc√©e, Derek.

God, Derek. 6‚Äô3, broad shoulders still carrying traces of his college football days. A crisp gray suit that looked like it belonged in GQ. He had the same smile he wore at our wedding just a few months ago. It was confident, easy, the kind of smile that convinced anyone they were exactly where they belonged just by being next to him.

‚ÄúYou look like trouble,‚Äù he said, smirking.

I rolled my eyes, but I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. ‚ÄúTrouble? I‚Äôm starting my first week at one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Brickell. That‚Äôs not trouble, that‚Äôs destiny.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm,‚Äù he said, pushing off the doorframe and crossing the room toward me. ‚ÄúDestiny, trouble. Same thing when you‚Äôre five-foot-one and have fire in your veins.‚Äù He kissed the top of my head, then leaned down so our eyes met in the mirror. ‚ÄúIs my tiny tornado ready to conquer the world?‚Äù

My cheeks burned instantly. He always did that, slipping in that pet name that made me sound both ridiculous and invincible. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me that,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù His reflection grinned back at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre five-one, Jackie. You whirl into people‚Äôs lives, knock them off their feet, and spin right out before they know what hit them. You‚Äôre my little tornado. And today? You‚Äôre about to tear through Brickell.‚Äù

I swatted him in the chest, laughing despite myself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so cheesy.‚Äù

‚ÄúCheesy gets results.‚Äù he said, and bent to kiss me.

On the dresser behind us sat our engagement photo album, spread open to a photo of us under an arch of white roses. It was a public proposal at a private gala. My parents were beaming, and my baby cousin was throwing petals. Derek held me like the world was his to keep. For that moment, I let myself breathe it in. My life was so perfect back then.

Had I known about the secrets that Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern were keeping?

I would have walked out of that penthouse and taken the first plane to Antarctica.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Derek said, slipping his watch onto his wrist. ‚ÄúTrain leaves in fifteen. Don‚Äôt want Miami to think their star recruit is late her first day.‚Äù

I playfully hit him as we walked out that door.

And that was probably the last time I saw him, or my life, in such a positive light.

We left our penthouse at seven sharp, the morning sun bouncing off Biscayne Bay, glittering like someone had scattered diamonds across the water. Derek‚Äôs hand found mine as we walked to the metro station, our steps in sync, the city already humming with movement.

On the platform, he squeezed my hand. ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said, tilting his head down at me, ‚Äúbig bad law firm ready for you?‚Äù

I smirked. ‚ÄúThe question is‚Ä¶am I ready for them?‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my girl.‚Äù

The cart was crowded, but we found a spot near the doors. Business suits, briefcases, the faint buzz of people reciting presentations under their breath. Miami mornings smelled like cologne, coffee, and ambition. It was a small car that alternated between stations. The rail system in downtown Brickell was not at all like it was in New York.

The cart glided into Brickell. There were crowds of people below us as we exited the cart and stepped out into the flow of commuters, the heat already thick in the air.

After a few blocks of walking, we reached two tall skyscrapers that were adjacent to each other.

Derek leaned down, kissed me quick, and nodded toward his building right next to ours. ‚ÄúGo on, Tiny Tornado. Time to make partner before lunch.‚Äù

I grinned, swatting his shoulder softly as we kissed one more time before we both went to different buildings.

Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern loomed ahead of me. A forty-story tower of black glass, the letters¬†*SSS*¬†gleaming in silver near the top. My chest tightened as I walked through the revolving doors into the marble lobby. Everything was polished to a mirror shine, including the floors, pillars, and even the elevator doors.

I caught a glimpse of myself again on the smooth surface of the elevator door. Small frame, neat suit, determined eyes. The elevator ride was silent, the kind where everyone stares at the floor numbers because looking at each other feels like trespassing.

When the doors slid open on the associates‚Äô floor, she was already waiting. Her voice was smooth, clipped, practiced. A woman in her mid-forties stood there, hair hanging loosely past her shoulders, pearl necklace, and a navy suit that probably cost more than my car.

‚ÄúJackie Delgado?‚Äù

She was Marsha Dawes, one of the firm‚Äôs partners. I‚Äôd read about her. Ruthless litigator. Built her reputation eating opposing counsel alive in depositions.

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù I said, forcing a smile and extending my hand.

She shook it briefly, her grip cool and precise as a light smile tugged at her lips. ‚ÄúWelcome to Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. We‚Äôve been expecting you.‚Äù

Her eyes lingered on me, like she was sizing me up for something far more than my r√©sum√©.

And in that moment, standing in the polished hall of one of the most prestigious white shoe firms in Miami, I swear something shifted. The way she smiled‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt warm, it wasn‚Äôt welcoming.

It was knowing.

Like she already had plans for me.

‚ÄúCome this way,‚Äù Ms. Dawes said, pivoting on her heels with military precision. Jackie fell into step beside her, heels clicking against the immaculate marble floor.

We moved through a maze of hushed hallways lined with closed office doors. The carpet swallowed sound, the kind of luxury flooring meant to make clients feel as though their secrets were safe here, trapped inside a impenetrable vault, or a marble polished coffin.

Every wall was adorned with carefully chosen artwork, ranging from abstract canvases to impressionist pieces that seemed both meaningless yet expensive. The silence was dense, broken only by the occasional muted phone call or the faint shuffle of papers behind closed doors.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get you set up with your office and introduce you to some of the team.‚Äù Ms. Dawes said, her voice calm, clipped, yet slightly chipper. She walked with her hands clasped lightly in front of her, posture flawless.

I nodded, trying to keep my own steps steady. The sheer scale of the place was daunting, but there was something exhilarating about it too. This was¬†*it*‚Äîeverything I worked toward all my life.

As they walked, Ms. Dawes added, ‚ÄúJust listen, learn, and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions. Everyone here was once in your shoes.‚Äù She glanced sideways at me with a smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes. ‚ÄúAnd remember, Ms. Delgado, the letter you received from Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern was the only one we sent out this year. We wanted you.‚Äù

I blinked. The only one? She opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, Ms. Dawes continued, her voice a notch lower.

‚ÄúHave you selected the vehicle yet? It‚Äôs all part of the onboarding package.‚Äù

I tilted my head. ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ vehicle?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Ms. Dawes said matter-of-factly, as if she were asking whether Jackie had picked out her desk chair. ‚ÄúMost associates choose the firm‚Äôs standard issue‚Äîthis year we‚Äôve partnered with Mercedes. The EQE sedan, electric, top of the line.‚Äù Her lips split into a wide, toothy smile. ‚ÄúThe Mercedes is just one of the many perks you‚Äôll have. You‚Äôll want to look into the options by the end of the week.‚Äù

I was lightheaded. A car? Just handed to me like another piece of office equipment? It seemed surreal. That should have been a glaring red flag. But I was blinded by the casual nonchalant tone inn Marsha‚Äôs voice as the rational part of my brain dulled the reptilian side. It was a white shoe firm, so it wasn‚Äôt too uncommon.

Right?

‚ÄúOf course. Thank you. I‚Äôll look into it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Ms. Dawes replied, her heels clicking a beat faster.

We stopped in front of a door with a gleaming silver plaque. My heart stuttered when she read the engraving:

**Jackie Delgado, Associate**

My name. On an office door. This felt so unreal. Between the Mercedes, my own office, and the starting salary of two hundred and fifty grand, this had to be a fever dream.

Oh how I wish it WAS a fever dream.

Ms. Dawes opened it with a small flourish, stepping aside to let Jackie in. The room was bright, modern, and absurdly spacious compared to the cramped student lounges and libraries she‚Äôd lived in for years. Floor-to-ceiling windows stretched across one wall, revealing a stunning view of the Brickell skyline. The sunlight poured in, bouncing off glass towers, the Miami River below glinting like a ribbon of light.

‚ÄúWelcome to your new domain,‚Äù Ms. Dawes said, allowing the faintest curl of a smile to appear on her lips. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you to get settled. My door is always open if you need anything.‚Äù

I nodded, unable to find my voice, but Ms. Dawes was already striding down the hallway, her figure disappearing around the corner.

My first real office. Not a borrowed cubicle. Not a library desk.¬†*My office.*¬†A tangible symbol of years of sweat, sacrifice, and relentless drive.

I set my bag on the sleek white desk and walked to the window. From here I had a scenic view of the docks and the Biscayne Bay, our condo standing proudly against the horizon. I walked over to the glass, taking in the view. It was incredible.

The hushed atmosphere of the firm. The expensive artwork in the hallways. The quiet efficiency of the staff. The air smelled faintly of citrus polish and money. Everything here spoke of power, prestige, permanence.

I lowered myself into the plush leather chair behind the desk, the seat enveloping her as though it had been waiting for her all along. My gaze swept the room‚Äîthe empty shelves, the spotless desk, the waiting phone.

Why, WHY didn‚Äôt I notice the red flags? Why didn‚Äôt I take my grandfather‚Äôs advice?

I remembered my graduation from the University of Miami, the day I received my JD. Her family in the stands, faces glowing with pride. My father crying happy tears. My sister waving furiously, snapping photo after photo.

And her grandfather.

He had clapped politely, even smiled for the pictures, but his eyes had been‚Ä¶ skeptical. Distant. As if he knew something the rest of them didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too good for places like that,‚Äù he‚Äôd whispered when they hugged. ‚ÄúYou think they want you, Jackie. They don‚Äôt want you. They want what you‚Äôll give up for them. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.‚Äù

I had brushed it off at the time. Old man nerves. Overprotective worry.

But now, sitting in her pristine office with her name on the door, the memory tugged at my chest like a loose thread.

For the rest of that month, my life felt like a dream.

Work was steady, even exciting. Derek and I slipped into a routine: waking together, coffee on the balcony, splitting off into the Brickell crowds, meeting again on the train home. At night, we cooked together or went out with friends, laughing too loud in bars that overlooked the water.

At the firm, I was fed the kind of work every first-year associate gets: client memos, research assignments, and document review. None of it glamorous, but none of it sinister either.

At least, not at first.

‚ÄúOkay, ladies, which one of you is ordering the second bottle?‚Äù Daniela asked, twirling her wine glass in the Brickell caf√© where we always met for lunch.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got depositions this afternoon.‚Äù Sophie groaned, shoving her salad aside. ‚ÄúIf I show up tipsy, Dawes will have my head.‚Äù

Alexa smirked. ‚ÄúPlease. Dawes probably downs two martinis before breakfast.‚Äù

I chuckled, shaking my head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her hear you say that. I swear the walls in that place have ears.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe that bad?‚Äù Daniela asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúHonestly, she‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ helpful. I think she likes me.‚Äù I said managing a light smile.

‚ÄúOf course she does.‚Äù Sophie said, raising her glass in a mock toast. ‚ÄúTop of your class, volleyball star, law review golden girl. What‚Äôs not to like?‚Äù

Alexa leaned in. ‚ÄúI bet it‚Äôs Derek. Six-three, investment banker, looks like he walked out of a cologne ad. She probably thinks if she treats you right, you‚Äôll bring him to the Christmas party.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes, laughing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre terrible.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you love me, Jackie girl!‚Äù Alexa grinned.

The four of us talked about everything from weddings, to work, and Netflix shows. It was all so normal I almost forgot I was still the new girl at the most intimidating firm in Miami. Or that i felt something festering below the surface of my senses.

Almost.

That night, back in my office, I opened another file from Ms. Dawes. It was a standard-looking client binder: trust documents, contracts, corporate registrations, financial statements, and even tax returns.

But the tax ID number had an extra digit. thirteen numbers where there should have been nine.

At first I thought it was a typo. But when I keyed it into the firm‚Äôs system, the entry resolved into a real profile: a hedge fund registered out of‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶¬†*nowhere*.¬†*Yet somewhere.*

The jurisdiction zip code did not match anything I‚Äôd seen. Not offshore havens like the Caymans or Luxembourg. Nothing I could trace. It was just a string of symbols that looked almost mathematical.

No. Mathematical is an understatement. It looked‚Ä¶¬†**mythical.**

I looked up from my screen and closed the file, forcing myself to breathe. It was probably some internal coding system.

The next morning, I found another file. This one looked like a normal investment portfolio. Except the timestamps on the trades were wrong. Yet, they weren‚Äôt. I checked the client bank records and deposition notes.

***They were all recorded. And they confirmed everything I read.***

An account had invested in a defense contractor¬†***the day before***¬†they announced a massive government contract. They bought options in a tech company¬†***hours before***¬†the CEO‚Äôs scandal tanked the stock.

I stared at the dates, the hours, the precision of it. It wasn‚Äôt luck. It wasn‚Äôt even insider trading. It was impossible.

‚ÄúEverything okay in there?‚Äù Daniela‚Äôs voice came through the door, startling me.

I snapped the folder shut. ‚ÄúYeah! Just buried in paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúWelcome to the rest of your life!‚Äù she called back, and I could hear her laughing as she walked down the hall.

Later that week, Dawes dropped another file onto my desk herself.

‚ÄúPreliminary review,‚Äù she said crisply. ‚ÄúFlag anything unusual.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù I smiled weakly, pretending that I DIDN‚ÄôT read what I read or saw what I saw on those hearing and deposition notes.

She started to walk away, then paused. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink anything. Half the work we do is making the impossible look routine.‚Äù

I forced a smile. ‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

When I opened the file, I nearly laughed. It was an account ledger for a small religious foundation. But the foundation‚Äôs charter dated back further than any I‚Äôd seen‚Äîso far back it couldn‚Äôt be real.

And this was when my instincts stopped whispering and¬†***began to scream.***

Clay tablets, Babylonian cuneiform, scanned into the file. The entity had supposedly ‚Äúmerged‚Äù with three different cults over the centuries. They each had their own god, each absorbed seamlessly into the ‚Äúmodern foundation.‚Äù

The current directors had names I didn‚Äôt recognize, except one. A professor I‚Äôd read about in undergrad anthropology. Only he‚Äôd been declared missing in 1997.

But the signature on the audit line looked fresh.

I checked the deposition and hearing letters once more. And my heart fell in my chest upon seeing that said clients¬†***existed.***¬†¬†

I sat back in my chair, pressing my fingers to my temples.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I whispered silently to myself. ‚ÄúIs this supposed to be a prank?‚Äù

I wanted to ask Marsha about it. But she was out that evening. She had to meet a client.

At lunch that Friday, Sophie was venting about a partner‚Äôs demands.

‚ÄúI swear, they think we‚Äôre robots,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDo you know what it‚Äôs like to proof three hundred pages of contracts in six hours?‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like Tuesday.‚Äù Alexa muttered.

I sipped my iced tea, smiling faintly, though my mind wasn‚Äôt in the conversation. I was increasingly unsettled by the files I kept working on. I kept thinking about the numbers in those files, the way they didn‚Äôt add up but still somehow‚Ä¶ resolved.

Or about the zip codes to locations that seemingly didn‚Äôt exist in any physical space. Or about the hearing logs and litigation reports filed with the clerk of courts that proved the existence of clients that were shadowy organizations.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quiet,‚Äù Daniela said suddenly.

I blinked. ‚ÄúJust tired. Long week.‚Äù

Derek texted me later:¬†*Dinner at eight. Wear that red dress I like.*

I smiled, typing back,¬†*Always.*

I didn‚Äôt tell him about the file with the trades, or the cult, or the tax IDs that mapped to places I couldn‚Äôt find. I wanted to believe it was a prank. A mean, cruel hazing ritual my sorority liked to pull with the freshmen.

But that cold feeling settled into my gut. A feeling of mounting dread that raised the pitch in the voice of my instincts higher and higher as I did more legal work.

Each file felt like a pebble dropped into water, ripples spreading quietly, invisibly, until you realized the whole surface had shifted. And by the end of that first month, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was no longer looking at my work.

PART I","I don‚Äôt know if writing this down will make any difference, but I need to get this out. Somewhere. Anywhere. I just finished my first month at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern, a well known prestigious white shoe firm in downtown Brickell. I remember the interview like it was yesterday. It happened in a upscale resort in downtown Miami. They offered me a gargantuan salary, unbelievable benefits, and even a luxury vehicle. It was too good to be true. 

But before everything went to hell, it started the way all good fairy tales do. 

In a penthouse suite. A perk for working at Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern.

I was standing in front of a full-length mirror in our bedroom fit for royalty, adjusting the lapels of my brand-new suit. Navy blue, crisp, tailored exactly to my short frame. The jacket still smelled faintly like plastic and starch from the department store. My hair‚Äîshort, black, parted neatly at the side‚Äîframed my face in a way I hoped made me look like someone who deserved to be walking into a place like Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern.

I tugged on the cuff of my blouse and tried to picture the week ahead: billable hours, conference rooms, and late nights hunched over documents. All the things I‚Äôd fought for in law school.

My chest tightened as I walked through the revolving doors into the marble lobby. Everything was polished to a mirror shine, including the floors, pillars, and even the elevator doors.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got depositions this afternoon.‚Äù Sophie groaned, shoving her salad aside. ‚ÄúIf I show up tipsy, Dawes will have my head.‚Äù

Alexa smirked. ‚ÄúPlease. Dawes probably downs two martinis before breakfast.‚Äù

I chuckled, shaking my head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let her hear you say that. I swear the walls in that place have ears.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe that bad?‚Äù Daniela asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúHonestly, she‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ helpful. I think she likes me.‚Äù I said managing a light smile.

‚ÄúOf course she does.‚Äù Sophie said, raising her glass in a mock toast. ‚ÄúTop of your class, volleyball star, law review golden girl. What‚Äôs not to like?‚Äù

Alexa leaned in. ‚ÄúI bet it‚Äôs Derek. Six-three, investment banker, looks like he walked out of a cologne ad. She probably thinks if she treats you right, you‚Äôll bring him to the Christmas party.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes, laughing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre terrible.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you love me, Jackie girl!‚Äù Alexa grinned.

The four of us talked about everything from weddings, to work, and Netflix shows. It was all so normal I almost forgot I was still the new girl at the most intimidating firm in Miami. Or that i felt something festering below the surface of my senses.

Almost.

That night, back in my office, I opened another file from Ms. Dawes. It was a standard-looking client binder: trust documents, contracts, corporate registrations, financial statements, and even tax returns.

But the tax ID number had an extra digit. thirteen numbers where there should have been nine.

At first I thought it was a typo. But when I keyed it into the firm‚Äôs system, the entry resolved into a real profile: a hedge fund registered out of‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ *nowhere*. *Yet somewhere.*

The jurisdiction zip code did not match anything I‚Äôd seen. Not offshore havens like the Caymans or Luxembourg. Nothing I could trace. It was just a string of symbols that looked almost mathematical.

No. Mathematical is an understatement. It looked‚Ä¶ **mythical.**

I looked up from my screen and closed the file, forcing myself to breathe. It was probably some internal coding system.

The next morning, I found another file. This one looked like a normal investment portfolio. Except the timestamps on the trades were wrong. Yet, they weren‚Äôt. I checked the client bank records and deposition notes.

***They were all recorded. And they confirmed everything I read.***

An account had invested in a defense contractor ***the day before*** they announced a massive government contract. They bought options in a tech company ***hours before*** the CEO‚Äôs scandal tanked the stock.

I stared at the dates, the hours, the precision of it. It wasn‚Äôt luck. It wasn‚Äôt even insider trading. It was impossible.

‚ÄúEverything okay in there?‚Äù Daniela‚Äôs voice came through the door, startling me.

I snapped the folder shut. ‚ÄúYeah! Just buried in paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúWelcome to the rest of your life!‚Äù she called back, and I could hear her laughing as she walked down the hall.

Later that week, Dawes dropped another file onto my desk herself.

‚ÄúPreliminary review,‚Äù she said crisply. ‚ÄúFlag anything unusual.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù I smiled weakly, pretending that I DIDN‚ÄôT read what I read or saw what I saw on those hearing and deposition notes.

She started to walk away, then paused. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink anything. Half the work we do is making the impossible look routine.‚Äù

I forced a smile. ‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

When I opened the file, I nearly laughed. It was an account ledger for a small religious foundation. But the foundation‚Äôs charter dated back further than any I‚Äôd seen‚Äîso far back it couldn‚Äôt be real.

And this was when my instincts stopped whispering and ***began to scream.***

Clay tablets, Babylonian cuneiform, scanned into the file. The entity had supposedly ‚Äúmerged‚Äù with three different cults over the centuries. They each had their own god, each absorbed seamlessly into the ‚Äúmodern foundation.‚Äù

The current directors had names I didn‚Äôt recognize, except one. A professor I‚Äôd read about in undergrad anthropology. Only he‚Äôd been declared missing in 1997.

But the signature on the audit line looked fresh.

I checked the deposition and hearing letters once more. And my heart fell in my chest upon seeing that said clients ***existed.*** ¬†

I sat back in my chair, pressing my fingers to my temples.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I whispered silently to myself. ‚ÄúIs this supposed to be a prank?‚Äù

I wanted to ask Marsha about it. But she was out that evening. She had to meet a client.

At lunch that Friday, Sophie was venting about a partner‚Äôs demands.

‚ÄúI swear, they think we‚Äôre robots,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDo you know what it‚Äôs like to proof three hundred pages of contracts in six hours?‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like Tuesday.‚Äù Alexa muttered.

I sipped my iced tea, smiling faintly, though my mind wasn‚Äôt in the conversation. I was increasingly unsettled by the files I kept working on. I kept thinking about the numbers in those files, the way they didn‚Äôt add up but still somehow‚Ä¶ resolved.

Or about the zip codes to locations that seemingly didn‚Äôt exist in any physical space. Or about the hearing logs and litigation reports filed with the clerk of courts that proved the existence of clients that were shadowy organizations.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quiet,‚Äù Daniela said suddenly.

I blinked. ‚ÄúJust tired. Long week.‚Äù

Derek texted me later: *Dinner at eight. Wear that red dress I like.*

I smiled, typing back, *Always.*

I didn‚Äôt tell him about the file with the trades, or the cult, or the tax IDs that mapped to places I couldn‚Äôt find. I wanted to believe it was a prank. A mean, cruel hazing ritual my sorority liked to pull with the freshmen.

But that cold feeling settled into my gut. A feeling of mounting dread that raised the pitch in the voice of my instincts higher and higher as I did more legal work.

Each file felt like a pebble dropped into water, ripples spreading quietly, invisibly, until you realized the whole surface had shifted. And by the end of that first month, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was no longer looking at my work.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

My husband and i have 2 kids. One is in grade school, other is a toddler. I'd like to start off with I'm not complaining about my husband whatsoever when it comes to what he does and doesn't do. I'm grateful that I don't have to work full time and I get more time with my kids. Every single week day I help my daughter get ready for school.make sure everything is ready and good to go. I make sure my husband's lunch is packed and his coffee is made. I take both kids to her sports so he has some alone time after a long days of work. I do all I house chores plus I'll burn papers when I can so he doesn't have to. My daughter gets home from school we sit down and we work on her weekly vocabulary, spelling etc. Anything she needs to work on, I help her. I make every dinner. Every lunch for the kids and breakfast on the days that I'm off. I do all the cleaning, the laundry, grocery shopping,birthday parties, Christmas, 
 all appointments etc. I play with our son all day too. When he does get home our son is all over him.he doesnt mind however My husband you can tell is annoyed that he's not getting any alone time. Which i understand. He doesn't really get much at all.  I don't complain when he doesn't pick after himself. I don't complain when I come home to a messy house and he was at home all day without the kids and didn't lift a finger. I don't care because of him I can be home more often. I appreciate everything about him but idk if he appreciates me? 

All I expect of him is to go to work and out door labor, which he thoroughly enjoys and wants to do. Now he will occasionally clean up or do some chores that I'm grateful for. 

So into it here, I feel like my husband thinks I do nothing right. Least that's how I feel. I put our son to bed. He fought me brushing his teeth. He wanted to just get into bed. I finally lifted him up and put him in the crib. He was smacking and screaming bloody murder. I just put him in the crib told him I love him and good night. My husband immediately went, ""He's going to be doing that forever don't you think? I told him ""no, he was smacking me in the face (just because he was very tired and a toddler). He just went on how I just gave up and put him down. He fell asleep withing 2 minutes. 

He states everything I don't do right but it's very rare for him to tell me what I do, do. Not just that,  but with everything it's always what I did wrong. I don't think he'd being malicious,  but it sucks. It hurts. Anyone else go through this?",1,1758507479.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
