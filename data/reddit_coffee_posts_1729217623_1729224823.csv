1g69pcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1g69pcz/coffee_crush_need_advice/,Coffee crush (need advice!)," So I work at this coffee shop, and there is this guy that comes in every now and then. We'll call him Joe. 
 He's been a regular for a while, but I didn't really notice him till recently and now I've developed a crush. Apparently according to my other coworkers, I'm the only one has really chatted with, and he's really quiet with everyone else. So that's nice to know, but like, I feel like we both just get so nervous and it gets awkward 🫣. Like idk, I feel like a lil vibe, but I get all weird and quiet like he does too. It's very cringe guys!
 My other friends have said to go for it. And my supervisor said that she saw him like grinning and blushing after talking to me 🫢. Idk, I feel weird wanting to make the first move, like I'm not shy but I am awkward, and it's not like a ""the guy has to ask the girl out"" thing, but I'm at work and he's a customer, so I don't want to make it weird for him to want to come back and get coffee if me and everyone else is wrong 😗. But I also wonder if he feels the same way. It's a shame I haven't been able to catch him there on my day off. 
 Idk guy. Has anyone ever been in this position crushing on a customer, and what did you do? Did it work out?o",1,1729224710.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

We're just finishing out our itinerary for a trip coming up. We will stay in Hiroshima for 2 days/nights and I'd like to take the ferry from near Peace Park (Aqua Net Hiroshima) on the 2nd day. It doesn't appear you can book or reserve in advance, only purchase tickets at site... maybe day of? I'd hate for the day to sell out and miss going, and the other options eat up a lot of time in transit.

Any suggestions/recommendations from anyone who has done this bit? I'm hoping I can either get the tix the day before or just get up real early and settle back with a coffee. TIA!!

Thanks for clicking and reading about me!

I have been thinking about connecting with a few pen-pals over email communication some time now. I hope to connect with others of similar interests (and a few of our unique differences to learn from each other), as well, preferable around my age.

I am currently studying graphic design and practicing illustration.I love nature, animals, and even spiders/bugs. I absolutely love geeking out about tv shows, comic books, movies, and so on. I use to play a few video games, but nowadays I have been pretty occupied, however, I have been meaning to to get back into playing old school runescape, so I am totally down to have a friend to play some games with.

I tend to gravitate towards people of similar music tastes, so we can jam together and share each other's music playlists! My favourite genres are: metalcore, nu-metal, dream pop, electronic, a bit of rap, etc. 

It would be nice to be all cozy, grab a coffee in the morning and get to know you and your adventures over email. I would recommend for us to chat a little over the chat box first before exchanging onto emails!

I do have some chronic health issues, so I may not respond quickly at times. Due to that, it's easier for me to manage a few meaningful conversations/emails. 

Feel free to ask any questions about my personality/interests! Let me know about you!  (:

Best <3

No one wants to stop and talk, have a bit of fun, people keep to themselves. I'm used to having lunch with the boys at 12. Here everyone seems to just do there own thing. No one seems to joke around in between working, going out for coffee is a hassle. No one wants to look at my puppy photos, talk about their renovations, talk about sport.

Healthy relationships take care and attention. 

This weekend, how do you plan to or think you can intentionally care for your relationships? Consider taking time to get a cup of coffee with a friend Saturday morning or get your family together to do a much-needed chore around the house. Sunday dinners with your family or friends are also a great way to spend time with those you love. It can be literally anything and can be as simple as including another in something you have to do this weekend like grocery shopping or shoveling snow. 

These things may seem simple but you are caring for your relationship by intentionally seeking to make it stronger. 

In the comments below, share your goals for relationship care, ask for help coming up with ideas, or just share how you feel about devoting your time and energy to caring for the important people in your life.

It’s 2 AM, and I’m still wide awake,
Textbooks scattered, I’ve got deadlines to break,
Equations in my head, and graphs on the page,
This engineering degree feels like a cage.
But there’s one thing keepin’ me goin’ tonight,
A hot cup of coffee, man, I’ll be alright 
Coffee and finals, that’s how I survive,
Through circuits and code, I’m barely alive,
Pour me a cup, make it strong and hot,
‘Cause this week is rough, but it’s all I’ve got.
From sunrise to sunset, I’ll give it my best,
Powered by caffeine, forget all the rest,
Coffee and finals, it’s a wild ride,
I’ll sleep when it’s over, on the other side

Got my calculator, and my laptop hummin’,

Problem sets, they just keep on comin’,
Stress is risin’, but I’m holdin’ on tight,
With a mug full of java, I’ll make it through the night.
The clock’s tickin’ fast, but I’m not losin’ hope,
As long as there’s coffee, I know I can cope.

Coffee and finals, it’s a wild ride,
I’ll sleep when it’s over, on the other side.


Late nights in the library, head in my hands,
Tryin’ to remember every last command,
But with every sip, I find my stride,
Coffee’s my partner, my trusted guide.
Just one more exam, I can see the end,
With coffee by my side, we’ll get there, my friend.


Coffee and finals, that’s how I survive,

""Dear valued customer,

Thank you for your inquiry. Regarding grinding frozen coffee beans in your Timemore C3 grinder, we generally do not recommend it due to the potential for moisture residue, which could lead to rusting.

While we understand that some individuals prefer to freeze their coffee beans to preserve freshness, the moisture that may be present in frozen beans could pose a risk to the internal components of your grinder. Rusting could occur over time if the moisture is not properly managed.

However, if you still wish to proceed with grinding frozen beans, we strongly advise you to clean your grinder frequently to minimize the risk of moisture build-up. Please be aware that there is still a possibility of internal components rusting, even with regular cleaning.

We hope this information is helpful and appreciate your understanding. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us. Thank you for considering our advice and using our products.

Best regards,
Jay""

Well, although this doesn't make much sense since even unfrozen beans can retain quite a bit of moisture. Also as they said, we should always keep the grinder clean to avoid oxidation.

We met once and meshed perfectly. The type of chemistry that makes everything else fade away because you’re both in your own little bubble, happily orbiting each other and cracking all the jokes that only land 50% of the time with everyone else. I’ve been in many relationships (red flag, maybe?) and have not felt that kind of connection before or since.

Unfortunately we were both horribly toxic. He was controlling, selfish and misogynistic while I was dishonest, mercurial and self sabotaging. We loved one another deeply and quite passionately, so the relationship lasted almost 3 years before he finally ended it. There were a few smaller breakups that never lasted beyond 24 hours scattered throughout our time together, and by the end we were both exhausted by the constant loops.

I’m still grieving. It’s been over a year now and every month, sometimes every 2-3 weeks, there will be a day when I’m consumed with missing him and the connection we could have nurtured. It feels unfair and unreal to exist in a version of reality where I live 3,000 miles away from someone my heart doesn’t understand it needs to let go of.

I don’t know how many of you are still grieving, but I bet it’s a lot if you’ve found yourself here. I’m sorry it hurts. I can’t promise you’ll be okay anytime soon or that you’ll meet someone new who will be the person you were truly meant for. What I can say is that the growth I’ve achieved outside of that codependent, toxic union is staggering and that you too can be a whole, healthy person despite the pain you still carry.

The life I live now has more healthy relationships in it than ever before. I put care and effort into the people around me and treat myself with far more respect. I journal, write music and treat myself to small gifts or things that bring me joy in the same ways I imagine a partner would. I’m still learning to love myself and that’s the relationship I will be focusing on until I’m ready, someday, to open my heart again.

I remember some vids like her being a corgi girl that was the listener's roommate/GF another where she's a raccoon girl and trashpanda was involved, one were she's a recovering Yandere that her therapist told her to break up with the listener but the listener is 100% ok with it, and a couple were she's a supervillain that 1 where she does not want to share HER nemesis another where she is in her civilian mode moving in with her boyfriend \[the listener\] and turns out the they are a coffee themed hero the she fights but I think she teams up with him on the heroes side.

oh there is also one where she's a shy shapeshifter who is the listener's girlfriends but was too shy to ask the listener out so she made up a girl who could and gets found out because he runs into her and finds she has a dual sim phone which when he calls his girlfriends number her phone rings he knows she was a shapeshifter too so.

I know I wrote a lot sometime I run on with stuff but I thought it would be a good Idea to have a few vids I remember somewhat to help with finding her again since I like her vids.

also I think she is British. so if anyone has any idea who I am talking about plz help and thank you.",0,1729222780.0,asmr,1,0.5,False

And well, I'm just gonna post it here:  
Fialová (Czech for 'purple) would be about a Czech aristocracy that catches wind of Walter White's meth empire all the way over in America. This is specifically the Czech group that Lydia had in mind when she promised to distribute Walter's product all the way over to Europe in Season 5.   
We never see Walter (obviously) and nobody ever does. They just know him as Heisenberg, who exists as a myth. Most Czech aristocrats don't even believe it's made by a human due to how pure the product is

The title is a mix of every color in the Czech flag, as well as being a mix of Walter's blue product and the bloodshed that comes from this. This aristocracy views meth as coffee, basically. It undermines a lot of their daily lives and lavish lifestyle. Although things would go steadily once it's introduced, the real issue is also when it infiltrates the streets. We get to see how meth heads on the street go crazy for the product too, creating ripples that are small and subtle to eventually threatening to tear this aristocracy down - especially once Walter dies

As for the actual plot and characters, still ironing things out. All I know is I want it to focus on a man (thinking of the name Jakub right now) who is a part of this aristocracy and its facet departments (like banking) who realizes he's not so different from the meth heads in the street. It would also be cool to try to integrate Madrigal Electromotives and flesh it out further outside of Werner and boys

Lydia would probably be the only character from Breaking Bad that constantly shows up, and she's one of many pipelines who brings information about Walter and everyone else involved in the meth business down in Albuquerque. The reason things would also start to spiral is just because the aristocrats around Jakub want to try to control the flow of meth and disrupt things over at this receiving end. Maybe a Mike cameo when someone goes too far and tries to take a plane to Albuquerque, so they face the wrath of Finger... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Any thoughts on this spin-off idea so far? There's a chance I'll continue posting about it, but mostly major developments. I also need an idea for where to even post it all...thanks for reading!!",1,1729222461.0,breakingbad,0,0.67,False

I’ve known her for 2 years now and my crush developed in the last year or so. She’s gorgeous, soft-spoken, intelligent, and very feminine. I started realizing I really liked her because I’d start getting nervous around her and because I’d think about her outside of work. Between us, we have kind of a professional relationship, not really anything personal. We both are teachers and we teach similar subjects. 

Usually when I’m in public, I put on a mask that I’m very confident, but deep down I’m not. I’m currently going to therapy for this so I can change how I talk to myself. Anyways, at the end of my shift yesterday I was feeling very tired and drained, I didn’t feel like talking to anybody. All of a sudden at the end of the shift, she approached to talk to me. I was kind of flustered and long story short, I was so fucking awkward. Usually, I’m not like this around her, I’m generally more confident because of the mask I put in public. I really wanna ask her out for coffee, but I can’t muster up the courage to do so, probably because I put her on a pedestal and how I talk to myself. 

I feel like I get signs from her though.  The other day she told me that I’d be such a good “girl dad” (I usually give off like big brother vibes to my students, I’m funny but also strict with them). Btw I’m not sure what exactly that means tbh. She also finds me funny when I am confident, and smiles whenever I say hi to her. She has recently been approaching me to talk, she listened to my music recs in depth, I was impressed. When she asks me something she looks down and smiles, but I’m not sure if that’s just because she’s introverted. I basically get mixed signals. I really want to ask her out for coffee, but my thoughts are against me. I’m sick and tired of small talk with her, I thrive on deep conversations that are meaningful.

Any advice would be appreciated :)

1g68xrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g68xrh/mf_the_great_mistake/,[MF] The great Mistake,"Longtime confidant, Greg loves his job more than his wife and harbours a strong admiration for Edward. In cahoots, the two dickheads have drained the State’s coffers dry, and there’s no respite. Reality shall confront them, but only after they’ve lined their pockets and lavished themselves with mind-blowing pensions.

‘Without us, this city would be in the doldrums.’ Edward sucks on his cigar, kicks his feet onto the coffee table and savours the moment. ‘It’s just a damn pity we live in a democracy.’

‘Well, we have manipulated the system to suit our needs.’ Greg replies and taps his nose with his index finger. ‘We can do whatever we like. Nothing is stopping us.’

A pretender more than a blue-collar champion, Edward’s blood pumps Marxist red. He prefers to push a pen than perform manual labour and loathes dissenters. Occasionally, to fool the masses, he dons a high-visibility vest with a matching hard hat and will do anything for a front-page photo opportunity.

The path towards the point of no return began soon after the election. A campaign to protect a row of houses from demolition handed Edward the keys to the vault. To commemorate the occasion, a larger-than-life monument ought to pinpoint the exact location. A proud moment indeed where one billion taxpayer dollars was spent on nothing. No tar was laid, no road was built and no tunnel was bored.

‘It’s simple logic and arithmetic.’ Edward says and looks around the room. ‘These people can’t tie their shoelaces, let alone organise a chook raffle.’

A staunch unionist, Edward has Das Kapital stashed beside other documents in his briefcase and likes to read Karl Marx. He dreams of grand projects. The bigger the better, and nothing is off the table. Many hair-brained ideas come from his backers and the squandered billions make a mockery of the system.

‘The state’s wealth should be for the workers.’ Greg pours himself a fine whiskey and sinks deep into the plush, burgundy Chesterfield. And who works harder than us?’

Edward's failure to learn from previous errors only strengthens his resolve. Poor decisions continue to compound, and everything seems to make sense until the day it doesn't. Often, spur-of-the-moment ideas transform into grandiose projects with no reprieve. Emboldened to rule with an iron fist, he has mastered the art of spending other people's money.

A convoluted reality exists, and nobody dares to speak their mind. One wrong word and a posting to the gulag is assured. As a result, the backslapping hits disproportionate levels and blind loyalty is rewarded. He dishes out free tickets to the Grand Prix, Tennis, or any other government-subsidised international sporting event.

‘You know, someday all this will end.’ Greg drowns a double shot and worries about the staggering debt. ‘The next treasurer ought to be competent with numbers.’

‘For your information, accountants don’t surf.’ Edward hesitates, mid-swig, before laughing it off. His chuckle is hollow, and for a split second, he looks past Greg to the grand portraits lining the wall. ’We’re in this together, right?’

Operating straight from Machiavelli’s playbook, Edward disregards long-standing conventions and prioritises personal achievement over public accountability. He does things his way and dismisses genuine concerns. Democracy is a malleable state of mind, easily manipulated to suit his needs. An issue for the future generations to discuss.

Their contemptuous behaviour is no secret and supporters endorse the nonsense. Yet, when Greg’s receptionist stole a pen from the stationery cabinet, the police handcuffed her and charged her with theft. The rotten system loves to prosecute misdemeanours but celebrates outrageous costly decisions.

‘Let’s give these bastards a show.’ Greg stubs his cigar into the ashtray and readies himself for question time. ‘Don’t forget, you are the Messiah, and one day they will immortalise you in bronze.’

A proud Edward beats his chest and tightens his belt a notch. He laughs at the suggestion and tomfoolery abounds. A mind-bending project, written on the back of a napkin, gets the go-ahead and another photo opportunity arises. Out of the cupboard, Edward dusts his high-visibility vest and polishes his hard hat.

‘What harm can another thirty, fifty or perhaps even one hundred billion dollars, going to do?’ A defiant Edward walks the grand corridor, adorned with portraits of past leaders. ‘It’s just a number.’

‘That it is,’ dumbfounded by the latest venture, Greg fails to see the benefit of another white elephant. ‘This venture doesn't pass the pub test.’

‘Listen,’ Edward grabs Greg by the shirt and drags him close. ‘We are inside the tent pissing out, not outside the tent pissing in.’

The greatest minds in a generation steer the bus straight into a brick wall and await the accolades befitting an Emperor. They’ll award themselves medals, honorary doctorates, and give speeches to students. With medals pinned to their chests, they'll continue to syphon the taxpayer until their last dying breath.

In the end, there’s only so much money in the vault, and the inevitable is only a matter of time. With nothing left to redistribute, Edward’s modus operandi is done and dusted. Nobody likes a dickhead and in a desperate bid to escape the impending backlash, Edward a lame duck, contemplates his future. The emperor has no clothes, the tide has gone out.

Thrown under the bus, Greg grapples with the staggering debt and it’s the ordinary citizens who bear the brunt. All too normal in a world where the incompetent reign supreme. The laughter of two men, once buoyant with arrogance, haunts the city. A reminder of their folly, leaving future generations to pick up the pieces.

The End.

I love cuddling, I simply cannot get enough!  I am an easygoing person looking for someone like-minded to occasionally cuddle with :)

I find cuddling to be one of the ultimate ways to connect with one another. Nothing feels better than snuggling up and shielding each other from everyday stresses. I love giving people the feeling of safety and comfort. I die of happiness whenever someone trusts me enough to fall asleep in my arms.

My goals are simple. Share life stories. Laugh, cry, and cocoon each other in warmth. Provide a shoulder to lean on when the world is being crappy. Watch bad movies and make fun of them. Discuss deep philosophical questions. Experience each other and the world we inhabit.

I have been told that I have a deep, comforting, soothing voice and that I absolutely must mention this in my profile =P

I have a lot of experience with platonic cuddling and I am willing to share my CuddleComfort profile with reviews.

Until this week,"Posting to reddit because I have been so freaking sure I'm one and done I'm embarrassed to say anything otherwise to anyone else. Like I have sold all the baby stuff sure. 

So I have a 12mo and I've been whacked on the head with the newborn/pregnancy amnesia stick. Because in my head NO WAY was newborn harder than toddler 😂 And now that my kid is a little person and so amazing my stupid hormones are like ""maybe we could make *another* amazing human.""

But my firstborn is my baby. The center of my world. I love that we now have the freedom to go and do things that enrich her world and another baby would definitely put a damper on it. Our house already feels cramped. My first is already a handful. I already don't sleep (positive or negative here? I can function on nothing but coffee 🤷🏼‍♀️). I love the idea that someday we won't have to decide whether to go to her basketball game or another kids soccer. I can have the emotional bandwidth for her. Travel is easier. It's not a huge ordeal for my husband or I to go somewhere for the evening because it's JUST ONE KID. We're finally learning to sleep and eat and walk and communicate and in a lot of ways I finally feel out of the trenches. What if I never got to rock her to sleep again (she nurses to sleep, I assume another baby would too)? What if she thought I forgot her? What if I love her more than the baby? Or worse the baby more than her? I love that when she needs me I am always available. She's my little best friend that just also happens to poop her pants and scream at me when I don't move fast enough 😂 My body went back after her. What if it didn't after a second pregnancy? What if another pregnancy was much worse? What if it led to one of the many scary delivery stories? What if I couldn't pick up my toddler? 

BUT

I took apart her bouncer this week and it hit me how much I'd love to watch a baby go through that phase again. She slept on me for a while this morning and I realized how much I miss the hours of baby snuggles (I realize you don't get this with a toddler). I think it would be nice for my firstborn to have a built in little buddy. I think later in life it would be nice to have a bigger family at holidays. Someday it might give her someone else she can depend on when my husband and I are no longer around. I think she'd make a really good big sister. I've been seriously considering homeschooling with the current state of public education but I wouldn't want to do that to her as an only child. I think a second would be less daunting just because I know how at least some of this works.

I(m43) love my girlfriend(f39) of two years, but desperately want my freedom back. 

We moved in together six months ago . I honestly just want my autonomy and freedom back.  She is a hypochondriac and neat freak on a whole other level. Like, today, she sent me a picture of my coffee cup. I left on the counter. ""forgot to put your coffee cup in the dishwasher.""

She wants me to run everything by her before I do it, or before making a decision on anything. She always asks me what I'm looking at on my phone, or who I'm texting. It's to the point where I hardly even go on my phone anymore, because I don't want to explain everything. She also wants to know what I'm thinking about all the time. Everything around the house needs to be her way, or she gets flustered.  

I've tried talking to her. I straight up told her she's being a little overbearing and it's making me feel claustrophobic.  All it does is hurt her feelings. 

I desperately just want to be single again, so I can actually breathe. 

Do I tell her I just want to be single?  She is going to be crushed. Do I try to stick it out and see if it gets better? 

TLDR; should I break up with overbearing girlfriend? Or see if it gets better?",15,1729221020.0,relationships,18,0.89,False

1g68lj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tech_Philippines/comments/1g68lj5/i_went_to_the_pmc_iphone_16_midnight_launchheres/,I went to the PMC Iphone 16 midnight launch-here’s what I learned,"https://preview.redd.it/gr6ezwrklfvd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbac5703269b5d868c2b91bb6793adaa349afede

For the first time, Power Mac decided to hold an iphone midnight launch in Davao City, the same kind of event that people in Manila have seen for many years: DJ-hosted, guest singers/bands, freebies, etc.

Since my trusted iPhone 6 no longer supports many apps, I finally decided to buy a new one and I decided to get it during the PMC midnight launch because of FOMO. 

You see, other stores have better freebies than PMC. Abenson gives free ref, Robinson gives free airpods plus 50% apple watch, Digital walker has Marshall speaker, 8telcom offered Beats buds. PMC? some overpriced cables and iphone casing you can buy for a cheaper price at Lazada or Shopee.

But I decided to join the craziness of the PMC iphone launch. I want to experience and see the hype that some of my family members and friends are disgusted of. I wanted to have a story to tell: na nasubukan kong pumila at mag puyat during the launch of a new iPhone. 

Here are some of the things I either realized or confirmed during the PMC launch:

1. Hindi lahat ng pumila, bibili ng iphone. I S-U-S-P-E-CT that some of them were paid to line up. Iba na ang naka upo sa mga upuan pag dating ng gabi. Those people who lined up do not look like family members who served as proxy while the ate, or kuya or anak are still at work.
2. People take pride in owning an iPhone. For some people, the iphone is just a utility, but for some of those I saw at the event, owning an iPhone is an accomplishment, a reward for working hard. For them, the Iphone is a prized toy. Maybe that’s why they beamed up and proudly announced that they’re getting the pro and pro max variants when you ask them about the unit they’re buying. For some people, the iphone is the equivalent of the rich kid’s sports car or a diamond collection, so please do not judge them.
3. Not everyone who buys the latest iPhones is a financial lunatic. There were other people other than me who were upgrading from very old phones. Sa case ko, I bought the device with the intention of using it for many years kaya nag “future proof” na ako. Likely also the case with others who attended the event. Some people also appear to have paid their purchases with their savings. Nagbibilangan ng bills sa cashier. Sa pila ko, ako lang ata ang member ng Kaskas buddies.
4. Do not expect people to act classy simply because they can afford to buy an expensive phone. Yun katabi ko tinapon lang sa harap ng upuan nia ang basurang resibo niya. I also saw this very loud girl na ang lakas ng boses makipag tsismisan sa mga katabi kahit may nag pe perform sa stage. These people really annoyed me last night.
5. Some people were not making the most of their freebies and perks. Sadly, I met a lot of people there who were not even aware na may 5k na store credits for pre-orders. Logically for me, mas maganda din yung natanggap ng mga last in line: they got 5k credits, so siyempre makakapili sila ano gusto nila iuwi from the store unlike those people who arrived early who got 30k or 10k worth of  pre-selected items, na malamang di naman nila lahat magagamit.
6. May free food (Bo’s bottled coffee, pop corn from Taters and Cinnabon, but be prepared to go home late: naka uwi ako ng 3:30 AM and my customer number is below 100.

Uulit pa ba ako? Hindi na. Nakakapagod. Once is enough. Besides, wala akong plano bumili ng bagong iphone in the next five years. On the brighter side, may bago na naman akong experience worth sharing sa mga kaibigan ko sa sunod na magkikita kami.",89,1729220794.0,Tech_Philippines,24,0.98,False

Up until the end of Sept., we had a near perfect relationship. For some background, he is divorced and this is my longest serious relationship. Every situation we have had up until this point has always been solved with a simple, mild discussion and ended with us hugging and kissing. Moreover, both of us apologizing to the other and saying what we will work on in the future.

Eric started grad school at the very beginning of our relationship. He started his internship back at the beginning of Sept., which is not only a very emotional job, he works in a juvenile crisis center, but a completely different work schedule from mine. I work a typical 8-5 job and he works 3-10 or 11 but only on Mondays and Wednesdays with two zoom classes on Tuesday nights. I have also worked with the at risk population and understand how draining it is, I left the field after not being able to handle it. Also in the course of our relationship I got what seems to be my dream job which is also very cushy in terms of the tasks on a day to day. It is way more laid back and less emotional in general.

Also during this time, his mother has moved into his apartment more specifically into his living room. She is going to stay with him (his brother already lives with him) from Sept 2024 until May 2025. She lives eight hours away and is newly retired so she just moved down south for the colder months. I do not know how this plan came to be and how Eric feels about it in general. Above all else, Eric is polite. I do not know if he suggested this plan or not because he never complains about it but when listing things that make him stressed he will list ""my mom here"" or ""my mom is here now"" etc. This was an established plan a while ago but he would always say “when my mom gets here, can I start coming to your house more often” or “I can do my night classes at your house” etc. I even gave him a key to my house at the beginning of Oct. Also important to point out that his mother cooks and cleans for both Eric and his brother and that includes laundry. 

I began feeling a disconnect between Eric and I at the end of Sept. Around this time I started to express that I was having a difficult time with my job transition and needed a little bit of support and that I felt I wasn’t a priority to him anymore. I tried to express that I understood he also was going through a transition and that I gave him a lot of space and still think of him when I can like getting his favorite energy drinks which are hard to find, freezing my baked goods when I know I won’t see him for a couple days so they stay fresh for him, ordering us food, calling him after his shift so I know he’s okay. I even told him that “I don’t have to be the first priority but I would like to be in the top three at least.” I do not ask for much other than him coming over once in a while just to sleep even because I have bad insomnia and fall asleep better next to him. I will fall asleep by 11:00 when he is here and without him usually like 2:30. He still does not make an effort to do that. He has largely stopped all gestures of affection that he used to do like bringing me coffee once in a while during my lunch break which is alarming to me. I fudging loved it when he did that but I am not even asking for that. We have had at least nine or ten long conversations since I started feeling this way, all ending with him promising to do better. Now the conversations usually end with me crying and him saying “what because I didn’t come over one day, I’m in trouble now.” 

I feel like he wanted a mom and once his mom moved in with him I was replaced. Is he losing interest or am I being paranoid?

Coffee / tea shop?. summer dress or super cute sweater
Beach? Beach dress or accessories.
Mall always dressed out
Downtown gotta look nice for the fans

Some of my friends now like to make side comments about how I’m super dressed up when we’re just going shopping.
Back when we were in school I was super dressed up until we had a creepy math teacher I wore hoodies most of my senior year.

But if I defended myself it’s suspicious.
With all do respect the guys my friends are into are not even my type I just happen to be that friend who doesn’t have a boyfriend. So not only am I singled out I’m also made fun of for it.

And I’ve tried the apps and I’m nervous about date night places cause I don’t  want to be alone again in a place where I’m not supposed to be.

I am having a hard time with addiction wackamole. I have been sober from alcohol, again, since February. I just got sober, again, from nicotine this last Monday! So like three days! Well my BED has been tempered this year for the most part and I’ve lost 40lbs. However I’ve been gradually back sliding since the beginning of September and plateaued. Then on 10/2 I had thyroid surgery with an overnight stay in the hospital and since then I’ve been using the surgery recover excuse coupled with the sobriety from alcohol and nicotine to eat whatever I want and however much of it I want. This week specifically has been entirely off the rails! I’m laying in bed right now after a 3 day bender and I feel so gross and out of control. I know I can and will get back on track. Also I had been on Saxenda (liraglutide) and it was totally keeping the food chatter at bay. I had to get off it of 3 weeks ago prior to anesthesia and today was my first day titrating back on. I’m confident once I’m back on the full dose the noise will quiet down. But until then I need to stop giving myself permission and making excuses! I don’t know if anyone else has experienced this but it seems exceptionally easy for me to binge when I’m going out to eat. Also I’m a small person 5’1 and what could be considered normal or slightly over eating for another person can be a complete binge for me. I feel crazy and people are always like you didn’t even eat that much. But like tonight I had two bowls of chili with oyster crackers and a serving of peach cobbler but I know my body and my limits and I feel like trash now and can hardly move. Oh and I read someone else say this but some of my counteracting tricks that are indicative of my toxic BED are laying only on my left side for hours after a binge and drinking black coffee. I also find myself participating in occasional exercise bulimia. Sorry this post is so long. I guess I need to give myself grace and just focus on one day one moment at time.

He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 



It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.



After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.



So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.



The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.



In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.



It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.



As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.



The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…



I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.



Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  



As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”



My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.



Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.



In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.



Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  



“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.



“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”



I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 



For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.



Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.



After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.



“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.



But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.



When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.



Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.



When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.



“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.



I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.



After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.



The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.



When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.



As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 



Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.



My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 



The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.



But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”



I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?



I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.



A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.



I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.



“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”



I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 



“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.



“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.



For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.



My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”



The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.



“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.



Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.



My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.



I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.



“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”



I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”



I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”



After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.



Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.



The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 



I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.



I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.



The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.



By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.



Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 



As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.



When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.



Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.



Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.



The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.



She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.



Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.



After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.



“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”



We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”



Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”



His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”



“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”



“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”



The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.



“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”



My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.



“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 



A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.



I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”



I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”



“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”



I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”



Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.



One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.



I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.



Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”



And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.



Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.



When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.



“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.



“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”



I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.



Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.



“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.



“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”



Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.



“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.



Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.



“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”



I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.



“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”



Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.



But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.



“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”



Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”



I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.



“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.



“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.



“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”



“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.



I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 



The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.



I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.



He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”



I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.



“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.



“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”



The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”



I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.



The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.



Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.



That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.



I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.



Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.



We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.



By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.



My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 



On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.



But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on [me.](https://www.reddit.com/user/LCDatkin/)

If you're like me you're probably bored, looking to chat with interesting people and dreading the hard work of finding someone that is mutually interested and trustworthy enough not to ghost you. That requires a few things from me and you: putting in the work and a leap of faith. 

More about my title...

* Introvert - i'm not a hermit by any means but i prefer smaller gatherings and thrive in 1:1s or groups of 4 or less. I'm also a homebody that doesn't drink, doesn't party anymore, and can be often found on friday nights at home watching sports or a movie or binging a show.  

* Dreamer - I spend a lot of time in my head thinking about what ifs, or thinking about the past. It ties into point number one about being an introvert, a lot of things I don't say aloud. Maybe that's why i'm into the whole penpal thing because i can write my thoughts out and put it out there.  Fun random shower thoughts are conspiracy theories, what i'd do if i won the lotto, random side hustles, etc. 

* Nightowl - My circadian rhythm puts me the most awake at night, i can't sleep before midnight and i'm most awake between 10-1am.  I always wanted to try and be a morning person and do the whole 5am wake up and workout thing but that is NOT for me haha. As a result i do prefer sunsets over sunrises, no surprise there. 

* Parent - two young kids has monopolized my life and sucked away any free time for hobbies. If you have kids, maybe you can relate to this.  I have pockets where i can watch something or chat on my phone, but any hobbies that requires leaving the house is a no go until they're a bit older.

Dan put the Aeropress up to the mic to get the sound of him pulling out the plunger and they edit in a balloon popping explosion over it. This happens a **lot** when they say ""oh yeah make that sound again up close for the mic"" or ""haha wow did you hear that sound"" or anything like it; whatever they try to repeat for the mic or whatever you just heard was covered up by layers of sound effects added in post. 

Another thing that keeps happening is they preview the next 'part' of the video in a transition in a way that outright spoils an upcoming bit or joke by literally just showing the whole thing. Some previews at the beginning of the video have done this as well. The bits are a lot less funny when you literally just showed me what was happening, including the punchline.

I don't know how long this has been going on, I don't have the energy to go back through every 10MPH and take notes and see, but it's really irritating to see content that can already be on a pretty bad sliding scale of quality get further cut off at the knees by editing that is actively killing the funny parts. I'm not saying they're not funny at all of course but, as with basically everything GG ever does wrong, if they'd just dial it the fuck back a little bit instead of driving it into the ground it'd be a lot better.",0,1729219265.0,gamegrumps,7,0.36,False

1g67z8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1g67z8z/come_with_me_on_my_journey_to_find_my_signature/,Come with me on my journey to find my signature scent! Part 2 & 3 ,"In case you missed it, I am on the hunt for a signature scent. I have only the vaguest idea of what said signature scent(s) may be like. I knew 0 about perfume before I decided to become really into various smells. 
With that, let us begin in media res: 

second round tries, Hexennacht:

babooshka— slonk 
slow-baked sweet gourds, Russian tea cookies, pipe tobacco, Autumnal spice accord, caramel, nutmeg, honey, coumarin, beeswax absolute, cardamom sugar, crushed apples, black pepper, liatrix absolute.

On first sniff in the bottle this has a pretty strong autumnal spice accord. Candle-y. This might be too pumpkin spice-esque for me. 
Wet and we’re getting pipe tobacco. Like a lot. I’m concerned but waiting it out. The apple is sort of drifting around in there. I’m not getting any roasted gourds :( 
Where did that tobacco just go and what glory she hath left behind her!!!! So well rounded and fall-y, balanced enough that now there’s not one note really taking over, but they’re all still distinct. I never did get gourds, black pepper, or tea cookies though. 
The base notes on this LAST. I swear to God I smelled it in my hair still on wash day.

Is it my signature scent? No, not really. It just doesn't have That Feeling. I'm not Obsessed with it. FS: Meh. Maybe if it’s cheap in the swaps? 

garden party— dram 
petits fours, rooibos tea, lemon curd, rose petals, orange blossom.

I was so excited about the notes on this that I BB a dram during an Ajevie presale. I thought this could be It. Spoiler: I am disappointed. 
The top notes on this are kind of … odd? Right away you get the petit four, but it’s not a sweet vanilla petit four, it’s a lot closer to a buttered, savory biscuit. The rooibos peeks its head up a little right when it’s wet, but barely. I wish it was more forward. There’s a creamy note in this lemon curd that I think is souring with my skin chemistry. I think it’s the initial onslaught of the sharp lemon curd + the butter in the petit fours that’s making this off-putting opening smell. 
Dried down a bit and now we are getting some nice rose petals and orange blossom. The lemon curd smells more normal. I think it’s the butter/petit fours note that’s clashing so much at the beginning, because it’s died down some and I do kind of like this sort of soft floral we’re left with. I don’t think the weird beginning stage is worth it, though. 
Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: No 

sunday mourning—sample 
freshly-juiced blood oranges, stacks of buttermilk pancakes, rivulets of maple syrup, and a melty pat of butter.

In the bottle— the reviews for this I read cautioned about a day-glo, aggressive blood orange top note, but I’m not getting it. I AM getting a lot of maple and what I am assuming is meant to be buttery pancakes. 
While wet— Lots of maple. It’s a very realistic sweet maple syrup smell. Pancakes are not here for me. 
Dried down, this is a yummy maple scent. The orange is being very coy with me and kind of peeking her head up here and there. I think it would be cute and fun for a brunch date. It’s not really something I’d go for outside of that. 
Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: No 

belsnickel—sample 
strong coffee, streusel coffee cake, nutmeg, brown sugar, toasted almonds.

Very bitter coffee note. It’s definitely giving baked good. I don’t think I like toasted almond that much. I smell this one as soon as I open my little samples box, it is pretty strong. On a second wear I started to get a lot more streusel, but I don’t know that I like it for me.
Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: No 

third round tries: 

hestia— sample 
marshmallow and clove. This is quite heavy on the marshmallow, with juuuuust enough clove to give it a spicy 'kick'. (also very similar to Cloven, but with marshmallow in lieu of spun sugar)

This is a slutty little perfume. I mean this in the most delightful, complimentary way possible. I think if I met a girl on the street and she was wearing this I would fall in love with her instantly. She probably majored in poetry and wears a lot of black and goes to dive bars and smokes American Spirits. She’s cool, she’s fun, she’s daring, she’s sexy. I’m looking for something that’s giving a little more lace & ribbons for every day, though. **Update: did get a lot more marshmallow after 2 weeks resting. I’m kind of obsessed with this marshmallow note. **Update again: this would actually be the beginning of some kind of Thing for me 

Is it my Signature Scent?: No FS?: Maybe? 

Loup Garou— sample 
silver amber, fur, lunar musk 

This one haunted me for a while until I got the sample. I just kept seeing rave reviews and thinking about it. I wouldn’t usually go for an amber note (I had a bad experience with BBW Amber notes) but I was so intrigued. 
In the bottle you get a lot more fur. This was my first encounter with a realistic fur note and I was startled. It mostly went away for me once on. 
This is a very nice perfume. Like when a fancy lady walks past, she leaves this behind her, but not at all in an old lady or department store way. That musk is sooo clean and expensive.
Husband said: “Mid.” We’ll see if I wear it. 
Dear reader, I did not wear it. It went soapy. Really soapy. RIP. 
Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: No 

Le Chat Noir— sample 
Chimney smoke, freshly fallen snow, and the cool, dry, musky scent of a cat just in from a long winter stroll.

This was barely smoky on me. It’s slightly different than Loup Garou, maybe a little more masculine feeling. I don’t know the science behind the snow note but it’s very on the nose. I might have my husband wear it in the winter. Update: I destashed it and I kind of wish I hadn't because I do want the experience of smelling a snow note like this again. It was so photorealistic it made me literally long for winter (?? the worst season, IMO?? Perfume is weird.) 

Is it my Signature Scent?: No FS?: No 

Lavender Shortbread—sample 
delectably buttery shortbread cookies + Bulgarian essential oil.

In the bottle it is buttery shortbread biscuits. Like the little scottie dogs. Straight up, there’s no mistaking it. I’m not really getting any lavender, to be honest. My husband— despite saying he is not a gourmand fan— kept huffing my arm, so he definitely likes it. 
Later—
Okay, I confess. I slathered. It’s soooo buttery but just sweet enough and I definitely am getting the lavender now. I can’t believe how realistic it is. I am starting to understand the hype around Hex’s gourmands. 

Is it my Signature Scent?: Undetermined, in the runners up. FS?: No, actually… this kind of fell by the wayside for me once I got rounds 4 & 5 and I only used maybe 1/3 of the sample. 

Lavender London Fog— sample 
earl grey tea, steamed milk, vanilla, lavender simple syrup.
This girlie was sooo photorealistic for me once she was on. Straight out of the bottle and it’s a lot of bergamot. On wet, that bergamot top note is nice and hangs out for a while, actually. Once the milk really comes in it’s like sticking your nose in your teacup. Even the lavender note— which is kind of coming and going for me— is very much lavender simple syrup and not any other kind of lavender. Lovely and definitely a cozy scent. I really like how it smells on my laundry when I come across it. 

Is it my Signature Scent?: No. FS?: I went through this sample so fast, I ordered a dram. Oops. I'm not supposed to be ordering too many non-sample sizes, we must reserve our funds for The One... 

tldr; I ordered some more Hex samples and discovered that maybe I actually don't like florals or musks as much as I thought, and maybe I do need to smell like a marshmallow, but a slightly complicated marshmallow, with no almonds... We are on the right track. There's also a round of just Sorce and a round of just Nui Cobalt coming up!!  ",11,1729218771.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I step off the bus after paying and start walking home which is a few blocks over. Should take me about 20 minutes.

Im waiting for the sign to turn green to let me cross the street. Eventually it does and I step into the road to cross. I hear this sound of gunshots and sports car engines. it’s nothing new in mega city but this sounds extremely close as if it’s coming right for me. I turn my head and see a car with a man hanging out the window shooting behind him. Before I can react the car hits me at about 70 miles an hour. My bag busts open causing papers to fly everywhere and I fly into the air landing on my back. The car chasing after the one that hits me runs me over completely. As I stare at the sun and take my last breath I wonder if I could have done it differently. I have no family that will miss me, no pets, no kids no wife. Not even a job that will notice im gone. No friends. To mega city I was just another number. Just another casualty on the streets. I exhale for the last time and just like that im dead.

I ride the bus home. it’s like any other day but today i’ve got this weird feeling in my stomach. it’s probably  that turkey. 

3:45pm 15 minutes untill I die
I step off the bus after paying and start walking home which is a few blocks over. Should take me about 20 minutes.

4:00pm
Im waiting for the sign to turn green to let me cross the street. Eventually it does and I step into the road to cross. I hear this sound of gunshots and sports car engines. it’s nothing new in mega city but this sounds extremely close as if it’s coming right for me. I turn my head and see a car with a man hanging out the window shooting behind him. Before I can react the car hits me at about 70 miles an hour. My bag busts open causing papers to fly everywhere and I fly into the air landing on my back. The car chasing after the one that hits me runs me over completely. As I stare at the sun and take my last breath I wonder if I could have done it differently. I have no family that will miss me, no pets, no kids no wife. Not even a job that will notice im gone. No friends. To mega city I was just another number. Just another casualty on the streets. I exhale for the last time and just like that im dead. I woke up not knowing I would die today.",2,1729218593.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False
1g67vo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1g67vo4/i_hope_youre_in_a_better_world/,I hope you're in a better world. ,"My best friend since high school committed suicide in 2017. It was confusing because she was the most outgoing and happiest person in the world. 

It was a few days before Christmas and we both hung out for coffee and talked about our plans for the holidays. 

She told me that she really did appreciate our friendship and how much she wished the world was a better place. I didn't pay attention to the clues, thinking it was her normal attitude of being bothered about everything. 
I wish I could remember about other things we talked about, but that’s just the way it goes, right? You never know when the last time you see someone is, so you don’t make the effort to remember much.

The day she died, there was just this heavy sadness over her friends and family and everyone who knew her. It felt like she turned the lights off when she left. 

It taught me a lesson: that even the happiest looking person could be silently going through their darkest moment while putting on a smile. 

Every since, I visit her grave every year on December 22nd. I bring her beautiful flowers, and just hang out and talk to her about life. 

If you're reading this, I just wanna say I miss you so so much. The world is still a cold, dark and lonely place. Nothing has changed. 
I hope we meet again someday, in a world that’s more beautiful.

I (M) am wanting to improve my social life. There's an old co worker I had that I got along well with, we never had anything outside of a work relationship but we hit it off as friends back at our high school job. She's been on leave now for about a year. 

I thought about DMing her on instagram to see how she's doing (don't have her number), maybe ask to hang out.

However, I think she has a BF. I'm not looking to have a relationship with her, just seriously want to hang out as friends, get coffee or something. He can even come if he wants, I'd be fine meeting him and could understand if he would be concerned.

Is this something that I should avoid doing? I don't want to push any boundaries with their relationship, it's really not my intention.

Started a few years after I took Acutane in my teens. I am honestly so tired of thinking about food all day, what can I eat, what should I eat, how much should I eat. After every meal or snack my stomach grows in size. I always thought that was normal but after reading many posts on Reddit I’m starting to think it’s not. People say your belly should not get bigger after eating but mine does and it feels huge. I am trying to make changes to my diet. I do drink coffee, but trying to eat more whole foods, no dairy, little gluten. I am vegetarian already. I started drinking peppermint tea at night. I take simethicone when I have gas but it doesn’t always work. 

Has anyone had success with getting bloating to be minimal? What else should I cut out? Caffeine? All gluten? I just want to be able to eat like a regular person and not think about whether it’s safe or not all the time. Or should I just say screw it and eat whatever I want and deal with the bloating?

1g67nvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmetophobiaTalk/comments/1g67nvq/3rd_straight_night_of_my_stomach_hurting_and/,3rd straight night of my stomach hurting and feeling N*.,"Hey all, once again, sorry for all the posts. This just really sucks, and honestly just typing this out can make me feel better sometimes, even if no one responds.

2 nights ago, I made a post about having a bad cramp in my stomach right before I was going to go to sleep for the night.

I wound up sitting up, sipping tea, trying to calm down until 4am when I was finally able to go to sleep.

I woke up yesterday feeling even worse than I did the night before. My stomach/waist kept cramping up, and I felt like there was something laying in my stomach really badly.

I kept myself busy by doing laundry all day, and just cleaning the house to try and keep myself moving, and not thinking about feeling bad.

I felt hungry too, but the heavy feeling in my stomach was so intense yesterday, I felt too N* to eat. Plus eating with cramps usually just brings on more cramps for me.

My mom was also complaining of the same thing, minus the N*, but she actually had me make her dinner last night, ate it, and felt fine with no issues after that.

She drinks a ton of coffee all day on an empty stomach, so I think that was her issue, because she's totally fine today.

I finally felt a break last night around 10:30pm, and instantly took the opportunity to sleep.

I then woke up at 2:30am feeling so dizzy and shaky from not eating. So I got up, and ate a few gummy peach rings just to get some sugar in me to stop feeling so weak.

That helped until 7:30am, when I had to finally just try and actually eat something, even though I still felt pretty S*.

As I was eating, I could feel the stomach cramps start again. I finished my food, which was just some more light noodle soup, and toast, and thankfully didn't feel woozy anymore, but was having the cramps.

These cramps are all in my lower stomach/waist area.

I took a nap after that, and when I woke up, I didn't feel too bad actually. My dad asked him to make him something for dinner, so I went out and got started on that.

Halfway through that, the cramps came back, just as bad as yesterday again. I had to go to the bathroom like 3 times within an hour. No D*, but it felt like I was going to have some at some point. I still might.

It's also been like 14 hours since I last ate again now though, and I'm feeling kind of woozy again, but the cramps are too bad for me to want to eat. I know if I eat, the cramps will get worse.

The cramps and wooziness is making me N* though, and I'm panicking.

Once again, everyone is in bed, so I can't talk to anyone, or run around cleaning things without bothering someone, so I just kind of have to deal with it, and that makes me feel trapped.

I feel like it's hard to breathe, I'm shaky, kind of dizzy, a little N*, my stomach/waist hurts, and I keep having to go to the bathroom.

TMI, but the last time I went, it came out with such force, if it was D*, it would have been explosive.

I genuinely can't think of what could be causing this.

Usually I can point to a certain food I ate that would flare up my IBS, or something like that. For the last week and a half though, I really haven't been eating much, so I'm nervous I have an SV*.

I know realistically, if I were to V*, it probably would have happened by now, seeing as this is the 3rd day of this, but I still feel so awful, it's making me panic.
