1ifn9pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ifn9pg/first_time_buyer_i_could_use_some_help/,First time buyer ... I could use some help!,"Hello,

Thank you for reading my post! I currently drink my coffee from a Philips Senseo coffee pad machine. I have been doing this for many years, but now I am starting to get bored by the watery taste. I am looking forward to a better coffee experience and decided to go look for a bean machine. And this is where my journey starts.

I quickly noticed there are uncountable coffee machines, so I am trying to narrow down my choices. But now I am stuck and could really use some help and advice. Let's get started.

**Current situation**

I use a Philips Senseo pad machine for my coffee. For my cups of tea I use a Philps water cooker. Where both machines are positioned, I only have 2 power sockets available. Both machines use 1 power socket each.

**Which beverages**

With my new machine (yet to buy) I would like to be able to make the same cup size of coffee as my Philips Senseo does (can you tell me if that is called Americano, Lungo or something else?) and occasionally it would be nice if I could drink a cappuccino. I don't need any other milk drink or exotic coffee formats. Just a simple cup of coffee like my Senseo but made from beans, and occasionally a cappuccino.

Since I have only 2 power sockets available to make my coffee, tea and occasional cappuccino, I have these 3 options:  
  
\- the new machine makes all the beverages: coffee, tea, cappuccino (1 power socket)  
\- the new machine makes coffee and tea, and besides I use a separate milk frother (2 power sockets)  
\- the machine makes coffee and cappuccino, and besides I use a separate water cooker for tea (2 power sockets)  
  
**Preferences**

There are 3 preferences I have. The process of making a cup of coffee should be as easy and fast as possible. Cleaning should take as less time as possible. This is why I am not sure if I should buy a machine with milk options, since these machines require more cleaning as I understand correctly.

My last preference is that I prefer not to buy a machine that requires a new expensive water filter every other month. I am not sure though if this is a realistic preference. Perhaps every machine needs a water filter that needs to be replaced every other month? Maybe someone can explain this?

**Maintenance versus price**

I am struggling with the following. Should I better buy an expensive machine that in case of failure must be repaired at high costs, or should I buy a cheaper machine that I can throw away in case it fails after a few years. I think I like the last option better.

An example: I could buy a Jura form $ 800 and if it fails (outside warranty period) have it repaired for about $ 300. Or I could buy a machine between $ 400 and $ 500 and just buy a new one in case it fails (outside warranty period). Any thoughts on this?

**What would you advice?**

So now that you have some idea of what I am looking for, I hope you can give me some advice.

I have been told that De'Longhi makes good quality machines. Based on my input, could you advice me a specific De'Longhi machine? The thing I am most worried about is the milk cleaning part. I do not like cleaning parts and small tubes. But as far as I have seen, all De'Longhi machines seem to have milk options and there are no models without milk options. So if I would go for a De'Longhi machine, which one would be the easiest to clean and maintain?

Then there is the Siemens and Bosch machines. I noticed some of their machines, like [Siemens EQ300](https://www.siemens-home.bsh-group.com/uk/en/product/coffee-machine/automated-freestanding/eq3-fully-automatic-bean-to-cup-coffee-machine/TF301G19), have a simple steaming pipe you can pull down to make a cappuccino. In the videos it seems quite easy, like even a total noob like me could do it. Also it seems quite easy to clean. What are your thoughts about these machines? Are they any good?

If you are still reading, thank you very much!!! I hope you can give me some useful advice. Although I mentioned De'Longhi and Siemens/Bosch as possible options, I am open to any other suggestion. I am a total noob on this matter and any advice is very welcome. Hopefully with your input I will soon be able to enjoy a nice cup of coffee! :-)",1,1738464042.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I got my snacks then realized for coffee, they had a single self-serve thing of house blend, then if you wanted anything else, you had to order it at the counter.

I wanted decaf because it was like 8 pm, but I just really like coffee.  So I went to the counter.  

I'd like a large decaf, please.

*What size?*

Large. 

*What type of coffee?*

Decaf...

*Do you want milk or anything?*

No. 

*Really?*

Yes.  [Thinking, 'I know you're addicted to pumpkin spice caramel frappachinoes, but some of us actually like our coffee to taste like coffee.']

*Oh.  Well in that case, you can get it from the drip machine out there.*

I want decaf.

*Oh yeah.  Alright.*

(A minute later)

*Ummm I know you said no milk, but we only have decaf espresso, no normal drip decaf beans, so...*

Do you *have* to add milk to that? 

*Well, I could just add water and make an Americano.*

That sounds good. [Why wasn't that your first inclination?]

So I got my coffee, ate my snacks, then left.  As I finished my coffee on the way home, I realized it was DEFINITELY not decaf.  I guess I should have communicated better: I only specified 'decaf' three times!",1,1738463983.0,TalesFromTheCustomer,0,1.0,False

I find myself in the random regional airports, and of course the hub airports, looking around and wondering if anyone out there is a work traveler that seeks the attention and desire that I do. 

A little about me, I am down to earth and professionally driven, which obviously have me traveling for work. I love to laugh and make others happy.

The thirst hit while I was waiting for an order to roll on in.

I was told that water is only for customers who make a purchase that visit..... honestly? Starbucks has had my business for well over 10 years (sometimes daily for weeks at a time). Not anymore, a water. The staff over at Dutch Brothers happily gave me a water.

Also I kind of figures since Starbucks contracts couriers that work for uber and doordash (or any number of convenience courier services) I am kind of like a contracted employee in some way lol. 

I cannot accept that sbux is being put in the ground by any abuses of giving out free water to non customers. In 2024 sbux made an annual profit of 24.996bil.

I figured I’d do a few trial runs (and also help clean the pot) by brewing a few times with just water, no coffee grounds.

I poured hot water (175F/80C) into the bottom chamber, put the filter in, attached the top chamber tightly, and then put the moka pot on my gas stove on the lowest possible flame. I left the top lid of the pot open (following a James Hoffman video). After a few minutes the top chamber started filling with water and then, seconds later, it exploded with hot water all over my kitchen. 

The water came out of the top chamber, not out of the middle of the pot or the safety valve. No steam came out of the safety valve either.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Creating a home decor aesthetic kitchen is a delightful endeavor, blending functionality with style to transform one of the most important spaces in your home. A well-curated kitchen not only enhances your cooking experience but also reflects your personal taste. Let's delve into the secrets of achieving an aesthetic that resonates with warmth, elegance, and modern charm.

Key elements to consider when designing your home decor aesthetic kitchen include:

- **Color Palette:** Opt for soft hues like sage green, muted pastels, or classic whites that evoke a serene atmosphere. Accents of richer colors can be introduced through accessories to create a vibrant contrast.
- **Natural Materials:** Incorporating natural wood, stone countertops, and metal fixtures adds a rustic touch. These materials enhance the visual appeal and durability of your kitchen, making it both stylish and practical.
- **Open Shelving:** Ditching the traditional cabinets for open shelving can create a sense of space and accessibility. Use this opportunity to display aesthetically pleasing dishware, plants, or cookbooks, showcasing your personality.
- **Lighting:** Invest in statement pendant lights or under-cabinet lighting to create a warm ambiance. Layered lighting allows for both tasks and mood, ensuring that your kitchen remains inviting throughout the day.
- **Functional Decor:** Decorate with items that serve a purpose. Consider stylish canisters for storage, decorative cutting boards, or vintage utensils that add charm while keeping your kitchen organized.

To truly embody the home decor aesthetic kitchen, pay attention to details and choose pieces that evoke a cohesive theme. Infusing your personality into the design will make your kitchen a space where you enjoy spending time, whether cooking, entertaining, or simply enjoying a coffee break.

Embrace the intersection of utility and aesthetics in your kitchen decor, and watch as it becomes the heart of your home!

**--**

I've been in the BDSM community for over 20 years, starting out as a sub. Learned a lot over the years, so I do understand both sides of the dynamic. Because of my background, I'm more of a FemDomme, with a side order of Findomme, meaning money isn't a huge issue for me. Little sends make me happy too.

I am more of the Mommy Domme type, definitely not into humiliation, but can accommodate small amounts of it when necessary. I like to have normal chats about all sorts of things: the paranormal, movies, WWE, politics and so on. In other words, real things not just kink. 

I am faceless, until such time as my sub deserves to see my face.

I accept only via Throne (link in my bio).

If any of this interests you, feel free to send a DM stating your intention. Tribute will be expected once a dynamic is established. Chatting for more than 5 minutes will require a 'coffee' send at minimum.

Best,

Terri-- but you can call me Mistress, or Ma'am. I'll tell you when it's appropriate to use my given name.",1,1738462997.0,u_Pleasant-Fly-1053,0,1.0,False

I’ve been in the U.S. for about 6-7 months now, and while college has been great, it’s also been pretty lonely. As an international student, making friends hasn’t been the easiest, so I’m hoping to change that!

If you’re someone who:
Wants a study buddy for library sessions (so we can pretend to be productive together).
Enjoys coffee runs, chill hangouts, and random deep convos.
Is always down for food adventures and exploring the city.

Then we should totally be friends! I’m just looking for some genuine connections—people to share laughs, study sessions, and maybe even a little bit of academic suffering with. We can start a group chat on Instagram, share socials, and get to know each other before meeting up.

I have yet another itinerary check post to add to this subreddit. I hope mine can at least seem like I did a bit of research before pestering you guys! 

This will be and my GF's first time in Japan and we've decided to stick to just Tokyo for our first trip.

My itinerary is the result of a lot of casual research over the last 6 months combing through resources like tabelog, reddit and podcast recommendations from locals and expats, as well as with the understanding I am going to have to hit up at least some of the touristy stuff because - it's popular for a reason. We like to eat, drink, and window shop. (I know, very unique) We do not care for museums or historical sights. 

I tried to have a healthy mix of plans along with long spaces for just exploration being mindful of sticking to one part of the city at a time. Really tried my hardest to find great bars that I've seen highlighted for vibes. 

I am hoping to get any comments or critiques on my itinerary like: things I should adjust, are days too packed or light, or places I should drop or add.

1ifmu6i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifmu6i,Ski Public Transit Trip Report: Winter Park Express Train,"tl;dr: Pano was open

Today was the big day: the ski train to winter park. I live in Golden, so the train is kind of dumb for me. It doesn’t matter though because it’s the coolest thing ever. We started the day by driving to federal center to get on the first W line of the day at 5:57. Highway 6 west was already looking pretty heavy going to merge onto I-70, so I was feeling great that I wasn’t headed for I-70. If you need to drive to Union, you’ll probably be best paying for a garage to park for the day. Amtrak has a list of garages in the area here: https://www.amtrak.com/stations/den.html
I would recommend the light rail if it makes sense for you though. The light rail cost $2.75 or free if you have an EcoPass through work like I do. The light rail actually arrived at 6:04 and got to Union station at 6:35 or so. It’s a five minute walk to the ski train from there. The ski train leaves from the main area of Union, track 5 on the day I went. There’s lots of Amtrak employees and volunteers helping direct people onto the train and getting skis loaded. Thanks to the train nerd volunteers! Information about that: https://winterparkexpress.org/recruiting.html They have ski racks that look very much like those at ski resorts. It seems to me that skis without a bag is the easiest move if you are going for a day trip. Bringing your boots on with you and suiting up in Moffat Tunnel is the easiest. You can leave stuff at your seat for the day. The Amtrak folks are clearly working really hard to give people a good experience and make this train happen. In particular, the conductor Antonio is clearly working his ass off for a good experience and on time departure. 

On to the train. Y’all, I’ve lived in Germany for about a year and a half and traveled a lot by train in Europe. This train is significantly nicer than even first class in Europe. Big spacious seats that recline a lot with a foot rest. All seats have outlets. The lounge car has got snacks, coffee, and alcohol for purchase and has gigantic overhead windows. The train was sold out (405 people!!), but there was a fancy ass seat for everyone. It was scheduled to leave at 7, and it left at 7 sharp. I paid $60 a person round trip. That’s obviously steeper than the Snowstang, but seeing how nice this train is, no complaints from me. This was really a luxury experience. 

The train goes north from Union station then turns west to pass through Arvada. As a resident of the west suburbs, I was hoping that they could add another stop in Arvada. Seeing how much effort it is to herd a bunch of people holding long sticks that are not used to riding trains onto the train, I now worry that a second stop may be difficult. Maybe they can get creative, like loading people into waiting cars and attaching those cars to the train in Arvada. As full as this one is, maybe we aren’t so far off from supporting a second train from Arvada. The volunteers came through with a brochure about the route, so I’ve attached a photo of that to describe the rest of the route. Around the mouth of Coal Creek Canyon, we saw approximately 7 billion elk. The train arrived at Winter Park at 8:40, 30 minutes before scheduled. 

You meet some characters on public transit, and this time, I had a chat with quite the character. There was a teenager who was headed to winter park to skin up to Pano. He said he was talking the train instead of driving because he lost his license because of a DUI a few weeks back coming home from Loveland. I asked him why he didn’t just take the Snowstang to Loveland if he has a pass there, but he said his dad confiscated his pass because of that incident. He claimed that it all went down because someone hot boxed his car in the Loveland parking lot, but I don’t know if I believe it. His red ski bag absolutely reeked of marijuana when it got unpacked from under the train. To each their own I guess. 

The train rolled back into the Winter Park station around 4:15 to load back up. We were scheduled to go at 4:35, but had a 20 minute delay getting going because of a computer issue. The view down into Denver is really cool in the dark with all the city lights. We had to stop for a freight train to pass just before crossing Hwy 93. About a mile from Union station, the train stopped and then started going backwards. I think they briefly had us stopped in a train yard, presumably to let something else pass. We then backed into Union station to arrive at 7:10 (scheduled 7:05)

I will totally take the train again. Super unique and fun experience.

""Strong Language

My friend James and I decided to never re-tell the events of this hunting trip but I felt it necessary to tell people in order to move on. I have spoken with him and he reluctantly agreed that it wouldn’t hurt, I am going to be heavy on the detail in case any of you guys pick something up just know I changed our names but no one else’s.

I had recently quit my job and started doing a course, I was sick of my job at the time and wanted to study and get a proper formal qualification as I never went to university and kicked myself for it. My friend James is a small business owner that is somewhat seasonal so he had time during the winter. I was on a break from the private college who shut down twice a year so we decided that since neither of us had shot a deer that year and we would try to fill our freezer with venison in our downtime.

We had both just recently received our “R License” which allows us to hunt in State Forests in NSW, Australia, these forests usually have some kind of pine plantation on them, they are used by the government owned forestry corporation and there are hundreds in my state of NSW, Australia covering millions of acres. The forest we had chose was Mt David State Forest is located on the other side of the Blue Mountains and is about 16,615 acres. We had chose this massive expanse of land as I had heard good things from several friends about it and it reportedly had wild pigs and fallow deer on it.

So the trip was planned and on a frosty Friday morning in July (southern hemisphere remember) we set off for what was supposed to be a four day hunt.

The drive was great we spent the few hour trip talking about life, previous hunting trips etc. When we got near where we were supposed to be mobile reception dropped out which was of no surprise, most places you go hunting has zero reception.

It was about 11am at this time, the trip was slow due to my mate’s incredibly large addiction to coffee and his seemingly miniscule bladder, I think we stopped three times.

We had been driving on dirt roads for a few kilometers now and we were starting to come up to some pine plantations but we weren’t sure where to turn in so we kept following what we thought was the entry road. It was here the first weird thing happened, we rounded a bend in the road to reveal a man sitting in a ute (Pickup truck for our American friends) with a huge dog on the back. It was strange, we hadn’t passed a vehicle in miles and yet here this guy was drinking a can of beer at 11 something in the morning. It was as if he was waiting for something or someone. I mean why would you just be sitting there on a dirt road in the middle of the day doing nothing?
We slowly rolled alongside him, said G’day and asked him where the entry to the forest was, he was approximately in his 60’s and had a big full grey beard, he had all of his teeth and a dark blue jumper which us Aussies would call a Sloppy Joe and blue jeans. He started telling us that there had been deer around and blah blah just general stuff you talk to strangers about when in the country whilst he sipped away on his beer. Eventually after ten minutes of talking he offered to show us the entry to the forest. As we were following him James mentioned how strange it was to be in the middle of nowhere and to come across a man just parked on the road and that he was almost overly keen to help, but I pointed out we were in the country and people are generally more helpful and friendly.

Once we got into the forest the man pulled over and I again pulled alongside him and at this point we kind of did introductions he said his name was Slim, I said I was Kevin and introduced my mate James. At this point he offered to show us around the forest and where we could possibly camp. I said thanks but we’d be fine but he insisted so I felt obliged to do so just to entertain him.

Whilst following him around the pine plantations made day turn to dusk it is really dark amongst 20-30m high pine trees and gives it an eery feeling. James pipes up and goes: “There is no fucking way we are camping where he suggested, we don’t know who he is, we have all our gear here, he could want to know where we’d camp so he could come back and steal our stuff!”

I somewhat agreed but in that moment I felt he was just an old bored bloke that was happy to see some new faces.

During the half hour or so drive Slim would stop and tell us the good camp sites. Finally he shows us a big open clearing and says that is where most people camp. By the time he was done with the tour we wanted to get set up but had agreed to not camp where he said in fear of getting our gear knocked off. So we thanked him profusely and that is when the first instance we got that our instincts may be right when just about as he was getting back in his car he pauses and asks: “So where do you think you blokes will camp?” I shut up not knowing what to say when James goes: “Mate, we’re not sure yet we will probably have a drive around some more and worry about that later on today, it won’t take us long to set up once we’ve gone for more of a look around.” “I really think you blokes should camp in the clearing, that is where every other mongrel camps” Slim said authoritatively.

Slim kind of got a bit agitated at this point and narrowed his eyes towards James staring him in the eyes. “Well you bloody well better hurry up and decide, it gets mighty dark and cold mighty quick in this forest so you pair will want to get nice and bloody warm.” Slim barked. James thanked him for his concern and we hopped back in the car and waited until he drove off.

James sat in the car and whispered: “What the fuck man?” I looked and shrugged not knowing what to say but feeling far less comfortable than I did 45 seconds before.

Once we were certain Slim was gone we started looking for a concealed camping spot, somewhere out of the way and a place he didn’t show us. After what seemed like forever driving up and down these forestry roads and scratching the shit out of my year old 4wd on blackberry and other shrubs we found this little track that went into the forest about 50m and then there was a clearing. The best part was that we couldn’t be seen from any road and we were happy with that.

So we set up camp, James had his dome swag and tarp, I had a new dome tent that I had never set up before so it took a bit to get going and in the tent I had my flat swag as bedding but at the end of it I was looking and thinking how cool the camp looked and snapped a photo on my phone of the camp which would later save our asses from spending a night out in sub zero temps with just out hunting gear.

With camp set up we looked at the maps I had downloaded on my phone to see where the no/hunting zones were and where best to hunt, we decided our course of action, loaded our rifles and walked away from camp.

After a good scout about we saw next to nothing other than a feral sheep that had gotten itself caught up in some blackberries which we freed and it ran off into the edge of the pine plantation. We decided to make our way back to camp whilst we still had daylight left.

We headed back in the direction we confidently thought camp was and when we got to where we thought it should be we couldn’t find it. No worries we will do a lap around we must have missed the track we said. We walked and looked and walked for 3 hours, luckily we had head lamps as this made life easier, well ok we were still lost but it was comforting to have light. After a while we switched down to one headlamp so we didn’t run the batteries out of them both. At this point James had the shits because I should have marked a waypoint to camp on my phone’s GPS software. I had franticly been looking at my phone trying to find phone reception so I could get some google earth images to work out where we were in relation to the clearing we picked but no luck. It was then it struck me that I had taken a picture of camp and it should have GPS info in the meta-data. Luckily for us the app we were required to use, PDF Maps had an image import feature that I found and this gave us our waypoint back to camp and so we went.

We arrived back got the fire started and James opens the Captain Morgan spiced rum which over the course of the night we had pretty much drank the bottle due to James’s liberal servings. (I’ll point out that at this point all of our hunting gear was locked in the car with ammunition locked in a separate container per NSW firearms laws)

We decided that it was time to go to bed at around 11:30pm as we needed to be up around 5:30am to be hunting before first light. That is when I noticed something odd, My swag was all set up, I could have sworn I had placed the sleeping bag under the canvas flap of the swag but there was my sleeping bag rolled up in its own bag on one side of the tent. I put this down to my imagining of setting my bed up properly and more than a few drinks so I drunkenly set it up and went to bed.

5:25am my alarm goes off echoing in my hungover head, I hate mornings, I get up, my head hurts and I dry reach from tiredness and too much drink from the evening before. Our plan was to get up, go for a hunt and come back light the fire and cook brekky so we get set and head off on our hunt, we had scouted this area and walked there before light so we could be in place as we thought the deer may be feeding in this area but when we got there we could hear the drone of a diesel engine just puttering away, we couldn’t see it but it sounded close so that was that hunt screwed up and we went and tried another spot. We get to this spot and now it is about 6:15am and we see nothing yet we hear the diesel puttering away and seemingly as close as it was before even though we could barely hear it when we first go there. This didn’t strike us as unsual it was a Saturday morning and there was bound to be other hunters out there but aside from Slim and the sound of the diesel we had seen no trace of anybody.

We call it quits and go back to camp for breakfast, this is when things take a turn for the strange. We get back to camp and the fire was raging, stacked with wood that was burning hot and strong as if it had been going for a while this was really weird, we didn’t light it, the fire went out throughout the night, it was not burning in the morning, it didn’t even have any warm embers as we had limited firewood and were conservative with how much we burnt so it was just about out before we went to bed the night before.

James and I looked at each other we couldn’t explain it, we hadn’t even stacked wood on the fire in anticipation for when we got back, we are never that organised. At this point I remembered my sleeping bag being rolled up and ran to my tent, unzipped it and not only was the sleeping bag rolled up again my swag had been flipped around so the open end, where you place a pillow is facing the front of the tent and not the back. I DID NOT DO THIS. I called James to come check it out and I called again he eventually answered: “Ahh Kevin, y.y.you might want to come check this out” he kind of whimpered. I stood up, zipped my tent and walked over to the front of the car where James was looking at the still frosty windscreen of my 4wd, where I noticed someone had written something into the frost:

“STAY WARM BUT DON’T BURN”

At this point I went off: “JAMES YOU PRICK! Don’t fuck about like that after this shit happened with the fire and my swag.” But I knew he didn’t write it, he was too shocked, he can’t go this long without laughing if he was messing about. I think I just wanted it to be a joke but the look on his face said he was not joking and as time went on it would be proven he wasn’t joking.

After my outburst, James he turned to me and just screamed in my face not like a girly scream but a massive guttural scream that came from deep down in his chest he screamed for what seemed like a minute but I was sure it was only a few seconds, I jumped back… it scared the shit out of me. At this point he threw down his backpack and stormed off into dark pine plantation next to us.

I was pretty freaked out, I’ve known James for 10 years or more and he has never behaved erratically like this in the past. I didn’t follow him though, maybe I should have. I just felt he needed a moment and it was probably the shock of what had happened at camp combined with the stresses of home life and business.

I was going to start packing up camp as to me there was no way we were staying, someone had found us and was fucking with us big time and who knows how far they would take it.

It was then I looked into the flames and they grabbed 100% of my attention. There was nothing extraordinary about the fire but I walked closer feeling the warmth on my skin; not that I was cold anymore as adrenaline was still surging through my body with the events that had just transpired but I was fixated into the flames. I just sat down by the fire and watched the flames.

I put it down to a bit of shock but I didn’t feel I was frozen in fear I just couldn’t think of anything else better to do, I felt compelled to watch the fire.

I was there maybe 10-15 minutes when James comes back and sat in his camp chair next to mine not saying a word. The fire eventually died down to embers, it was about 11:30am this stage when I snapped out of the sleep-like trance and I heard that diesel 4wd in the distance get louder and louder to the point I could tell it was driving right by us on the road.

At this point we both sort of tilted our heads to listen whilst looking in the direction of the vehicle’s engine noise waiting for it to come through our hidden track but it just droned on past us and eventually out of ear shot. It must have just been another hunter or visitor to the forest - after all diesel 4wds in the bush are one of the most common types of vehicle.

I was fully alert by this stage and feeling much more at ease, I turned to James and asked him how he was which he replied with half a smile on his face:

“Fuck this guy, who the fuck does he think he is trying to fuck with us, just because we don’t live out in inbred country he thinks he can fuck with us and we’ll just move on out of his precious hunting grounds?” “Well Fuck that I ain’t going nowhere.”

I was surprised by his apparent anger and protest of what had happened as James is definitely not a guy who loves a fight and really he was not a usually an angry guy, but who can blame him for being angry after someone had disrespected us and messed with our camp whilst we weren’t there. It is one of the rules of camping: Unless you need help you do not go into another camp when it’s unattended. It is rude and will get you a beating if you wander into the wrong person’s camp.

So at this point, I asked James if he wanted to move camp, which before I sat down at the fire I was determined to do but now I wasn’t so concerned for some strange reason. He said no let’s give it another night as he rummaged around in the esky pulling out bacon and eggs for breakfast even though at this stage it was closer to lunch.

I had started to rationalise it and thought about what had happened and if it was really that bad: My sleeping bag was rolled up. We heard a vehicle in the distance but never saw it. The fire was burning when we got back to camp. STAY WARM BUT DON’T BURN was inscribed in the frost of my windscreen. My bed was messed with. It is weird the stay warm thing made sense with the fire going, the bed thing is also strange but somewhat non-threatening the only threatening thing was the Don’t Burn part of the message. But was it a threat or a warning? I didn’t know. I really didn’t.

After what turned out to be brunch we talked about what we should do. James suggested that we just go about our business and see if anything else happens, he said it could have been kids coming through trying to scare us and they’ve moved on, I hadn’t told him about how my sleeping bag was rolled up the night before yet but I sort of was nonchalant about the whole thing now and didn’t really care nor did I feel in that much danger, I was just a bit spooked out. I don’t know why my feelings changed so quickly as when James stormed off I was determined that we were leaving or at the very least, moving camp.

He said “We’ll stay just another night”.

I agreed and said we should just explore around the camp to see if we missed a cabin or other campers in the area.

So we stayed together and we looked around seeing nothing out of the ordinary in the immediate vicinity of camp but we followed the clearing which was long and narrow to one end and doubled back past camp to check if anything had happened (nothing did) and walked to the other end.

Once we got back to camp we decided to see what was on the other side of pine plantation. We had our rifles with us incase we saw some deer and to make sure they couldn’t be stolen. When we got to the other side of the pine plantation there was a beautiful clearing it was circular and covered on all sides as if someone just decided to clear and mow the area. It was a bit odd that this clearing was here, it didn’t seem like it was supposed to belong. Whilst pondering about the existence of this clearning I heard crashing on the opposite side of the clearing and into the brush. I quickly raised my rifle to see if it was a deer but what I saw couldn’t have been be further from a deer. I just caught a quick glimpse of blue jeans and workboots for like two steps that disappeared into the thick scrub. I screamed out: “HEY YOU COME BACK”

To which all we heard in reply was maniacal giggling.

I looked at James he was already looking at me and I suggested we go back to camp he/she/it might double back there to mess with us.

So we headed back to camp but came in a different way to the way we left and we stalked up on camp as if it was a deer we were about to shoot.

Both of us had our rifles in hand which I realised was odd as we’d usually have them slung over our shoulder I guess we were wary as to what happened.

Camp started to come into view, first the top of our 4wd then the top of my tent and then the whole of camp came into view: Nothing was amiss, just the fire gently smoking it’s last bits of wood away, everything seemed in its place and my tent had not been touched.

At this point I was slightly freaked out, James was as calm as he had been since he walked off into the bush by himself.

I was curious about this and asked him why he screamed into my face and stormed off.

His reply was:

“What the fuck do you mean? You are the one who yelled at me and you walked off!”

I got real mad and barked at him:

“Mate don’t bullshit me, you screamed in my fucking face and walked off down there” - Pointing towards the pine plantation we had not long walked through.

“Like Fuck I did, I came by and sat at the fire after you had your little tanty (tantrum)!”

I just went quiet, I knew full well the opposite happened and wasn’t about to push the issue any further. I’m a skeptical guy, I don’t believe in ghosts, afterlife or any of that crap I knew how it went down and he definitely went into the bush whilst I stayed by the fire.

At this point I went and said to James that we should pack up and leave before dark. We haven’t seen a deer or pig and we are wasting our time here to be terrorised by whoever we saw in the clearing.

“Don’t be a bitch man, nothing has happened let’s just go get our deer, I didn’t come here to come back empty handed and my freezer is empty” James demanded. I thought maybe he was right but I was still unsure. But I went along maybe it was just stress that is leading us to clash.

We hung around camp for an hour before gearing up to go on another hunt.

We walked straight down the road our track came off and down the bottom of the forest where the pine met a clearing and it then when to native gum scrub.

I felt safer when I had my rifle in my hand. I thought to myself at least if something happens I have some form of defense.

Over the top of the clearing we come across what seemed to be some old sheds from what must have once been a farm.

It looked like people would often camp here and Slim did point this area out to us during his tour.

We walked up to the sheds to investigate.

There was a dead wombat lying near the shed, it had been dead for a while but wasn’t smelly as it was the middle of winter.

Everything seemed normal and we moved on down the gully to sit out dusk and see if any deer would come out to feed.

We saw nothing but a few kangaroos and a wombat that walked within 5m of us so we knew we weren’t scaring the deer off as the other animals didn’t notice us.

We headed back with what we thought would be enough time to get back to camp before dark.

As we approached the sheds that’s when the truly weird shit happened, the wombat was gone, someone had moved it, you could even see the depression in the grass where it was once lying.

Now James started to get freaked out as he ordered: “Come on lets go back to camp” He started to march quickly back in the direction of camp. He was walking so fast I had trouble keeping up with him and he didn’t slow the entire way back I was always about 5m behind him.

We get back to camp just on dark. The fire was stacked with wood and covered with unmistakeable smell of diesel fuel as if we interrupted someone trying to light it quickly.

James completely ignored that when he pulled out his headlamp and was looking around camp as if he was looking for something. I felt compelled to do the same. My bed hadn’t been touched, James’s had pine cones laid over his swag in an arrow shape pointing towards the car this was weird but now we knew someone had been there. I looked over at my car and on the bonnet of the car was a small pool of liquid. It was blood.

There it was the wombat hanging upside down from one of its rear back legs in the tree over my 4wd spinning ever so slightly in the cold breeze. It’s entrails had been torn out hanging about a metre lower than the wombat’s upside down head. The blood was slowly running down its guts and dripping onto the bonnet of my car. That is when I noticed it had something in its mouth, it took me a while to work out what it was. It was a sock, more specifically it was one of my socks a black sock with blue on the heel and toes.

I called over to James and he saw it - he got mad, he just started shooting at the wombat in what must have been fear and anger, it was the first physical thing that had been left there. the first thing that both of us could truly know that it wasn’t either one of us, the first real proof that we were a part of some psycho’s reign of terror.

James calls it:

“You were right let’s pack up and get the fuck out of here.”

We both keep our rifles slung over our shoulders whilst we hurriedly pack up camp and prepare to leave that is when we hear the drone of the diesel coming up to our location. I sneak over to the track and hide behind a tree anticipating the 4wd to pass me so I can confirm it is this Slim guy. I chamber a round in my rifle and wait.

I finally start to see light crack through the trees “he is not far away now” I think to myself.

He is going slow maybe 10km/h as if he is looking for something. As he approaches my location he stops and I get my first confirmation it was Slim. He still doesn’t know I am there as I peak my head around the corner watching what he does.

He has his interior light on and is looking down at his lap which I find odd but then he lifts up what must be be a smoke as he licks down the side of it and puts it in his mouth and lights it up then he drives on but this time he nails it and by the time I lost sight of him he must have been doing 60km/h.

Did he know I was watching him? WTF it was so weird that he stopped exactly where I was hiding.

By the time I get back James has most of the truck packed, his swag, my swag are in the back so is all the other camping gear we just have to pack up the tent and his tarp and we’ll be out of here.

That is when we heard the diesel again but saw no lights, we then heard yelling:

“YOU BETTER LEAVE RIGHT NOW BOYS YOU DON’T WANNA GET BURNT” “LEAVE NOW OR BURN HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA” “LEAVE NO OR BURN HAHAHAHA, LEAVE NOW OR BURN HAHAHAHA” The voice said this over and over as we rush to the pack up. We left the tent and tarp there we didn’t care about that, we had everything else and we were both proper scared now.

We jump in our car and we fucking nail it towards what we think is the exit of the forest.

We bloody got lost again! I drive and drive for about 45 mins and I’m driving as fast as I can without crashing.

We then saw something we didn’t expect to see: Rural Fire Service Trucks.

They saw us too I honked my horn at them but they kept driving. Seeing as we were so lost we decided to follow them thinking they will be able to tell us how to get out.

So we followed the two trucks and sure enough they bloody drove straight to our camp site where there was Slim’s ute waiting for them.

We didn’t know what to do at this stage other than get out and see what the commotion was about. We were more comfortable knowing there was six firies there and that is when we pulled up and walked down the track to what was left of our campsite.

The whole camp was set on fire my tent was no more just a melted black mass on the ground the trees where James’s tarp was tied to were burning and once the firies were well on the way to extinguishing the fire the Chief started questioning us as to why we burnt the area.

The fire chief barks at us: “Why didn’t you put your fire out before you bloody left?“ “If it wasn’t for Slim radioing HQ the whole forest could have bloody went up!” “Fucking city wankers coming here not having a clue, don’t ever come here again, we mean it you ain’t fucking welcome around here again!”

I looked over at Slim wanting to kill him he looked back at me with an evil look on his face as he mouthed “Don’t say a fucking word.” His stare was so intense, I could have swore he said out loud: “Burn you cunts” but no one reacted so I must have imagined it but James would later confirm he thought he heard him say it as well. Due to this we didn’t protest to the accusations, Slim was well and truly under our skin now.

The firies put the last of the fire out and begrudgingly said we could follow them out and they directed us back to Oberon.

We got into Oberon late that night and checked into the local pub which had rooms to let at about 9pm.

As we were walking back to our car to get some clothes we saw the last person we wanted leaning up against the street rolling a smoke with a beer can on the bonnet.

We stopped dead in our tracks he raised his eyes over his rollie to look at us, an evil smile rolled across his face and then started that maniacal giggling that we heard back in the clearing.

We didn’t even bother returning the keys to the pub we just hopped in our car and drove back to Sydney and would later post the keys back to the pub.

When we were unpacking our gear we found a note that was tucked into a spare pair of boots I had and it read: “Feeling hot? See ya next time boys!”

I don’t know exactly what happened or what we did to Slim or even who Slim was but there was some spooky shit that went on that weekend and we can’t explain it.

We both have nightmares about it all the time.

Everytime I see a 4wd like Slim’s I tremble. It’s so strange It’s so scary but for some weird reason both of us have talked about the next time we go back there.

I feel drawn to the place and so does James but we swore if we ever went back we would go together and we must try to fight the urge.

Does anyone have any thoughts on what happened and why we feel compelled to go back? Anybody have any idea of the James swearing blind (Still to this day) that I was the one who in fact walked off after we came back to the lit fire and message?

I would love answers as right now I have none but I just feel I need to go back!

1ifmss8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ifmss8/drunk_people_are_boring/,Drunk people are….  Boring,"I know this is not news to any of you I’m sure but I was out this evening for a friends birthday - we are all pretty big drinkers (well, I’m not anymore 😁). The first hour or two were fun - it was nice to catch up with people and talk and laugh. Then everyone slowly started descending into being sloppy and out of it (drunk). The conversations no longer felt like normal conversations, it was like I couldn’t understand the timing of things. The jokes weren’t funny and honestly I started to feel annoyed by the way people were interacting with me. 

I’m not judging at all because I know that this was me and is anyone who is drinking but it was just really frustrating to stop enjoying others company this evening because of the slide into sloppy madness. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve noticed it and it does make going out in the evening a struggle for me. Currently my approach has been to leave once I notice ‘the change’ happen. I’ve realised that I much prefer sober centred activities (walk, lunch, coffee, gaming, museum, exercise) to the nighttime stuff. 

Just some thoughts. Hope everyone’s having a good weekend.

The early bird gets the worm, and the saying seems to ring true when it comes to some of our most successful public figures and their morning habits.
While it’s an Aussie habit to rise with the sun, high-flyers seem to take that one step further, with a study of over 1000 US CEOs by Inc. magazine in 2022 finding 64 per cent wake up by 6am or earlier.

But breakfast TV host Natalie Barr is partway through her working day on the television screen by then, woken by her alarm at an eye-watering 2.40am to make it to Seven’s Sunrise studio in time for cameras to start rolling at 5.30am.

Barr’s secret to the surviving her perfect early wakeup is planning- and a coffee by 3am.

“I think after 22 years of this shift, my body starts getting ready to get up somewhere around 2.00am and I wake up, stare at the ceiling, toss and turn, debate trying to go back to sleep, give up and get up somewhere before 2.30am,” she said.

“I always put my clothes out in the bathroom the night before because, hey, every minute counts and I love organisation.”

For star NRL player and Manly Sea Eagles captain Tom Trbojevich, stretches and an ice-cold shower get him started to take on the day, while Australian Olympic Committee boss Matt Caroll has a more leisurely start, strolling along Sydney’s Balmoral Beach with his pooch Marge.

“It’s better to have a time for clear thoughts before the calls, the texts and the emails commence,” Carroll said.

From morning exercise to the first coffee of the day, we reveal how some of our top talent in the boardroom, on-screen and on the sporting field start their days.

CHRIS MINNS
Premier Chris Minns starts his morning at 5am with a quick 30-minute exercise burst either at home or at the gym. Kettle bells are an old favourite and there’s a focus on body weights.

At 5:30am he checks in with his staff and reads all the newspapers and gets on top of what’s running across the radio. If there’s any issues that have arisen overnight, he prepares himself to respond.

“Every morning is different,” Mr Minns said.

“If I have morning TV and radio interviews they are usually early. If I have a press conference, I’ll be reading materials.”

Otherwise, the NSW leader spends the rest of his morning in the office for meetings or out at events.

“In between all that I’ll get the kids to school,” he said.

ANTHONY ALBANESE

The Prime Minister’s morning starts by 6am, if not before.

He reads news summaries and listens to the morning news bulletins, before taking the First Dog, cavoodle Toto, outside before feeding her from 6.30am.

By 7am Mr Albanese is usually making a coffee and checking the country’s newspapers again, at 7.10am he’ll start the first of the day’s interviews – usually on radio – or moving to his first engagement of the day.

At 8am he holds a briefing with his team where the rest of the day’s agenda is spelt out, and if there’s time, he’ll take Toto for a walk and make calls.

Likewise, if not whisked away to an event or an interview, he’ll have eggs for breakfast.

Exercise in the morning can be difficult to fit in and depends on where in the country or the world the Prime Minister is, but when in Canberra he’ll sometimes start the day with a swim.

PETER DUTTON

Australia’s federal Opposition Leader starts his day at 4.30am with exercise between five and six o’clock.

Mr Dutton, who doesn’t drink coffee, opts for either peppermint tea or an English breakfast tea next, and also reads the papers after waking up

“He likes the gym and he likes to walk. He will walk seven to 10 kilometres when he can,” Mr Dutton’s camp revealed.

“If we are limited on time, he will try to go to the gym. Rowing, cycling, some weight work, talking on the treadmill.”

Then it’s time for an office meeting usually between 6-7am before breakfast after which a day of engagements begins.

Although not a part of his morning routine, Mr Dutton is also an avid meditator, meditating daily before bed.

“He meditates but he generally does that in the evening before he goes to bed. It helps him sleep and relax. He’s been a big advocate for that,” a team member said.

JOHN SYMOND

It’s a waterfront start for the Aussie Home Loans founder, who’ll wake each day inside ‘Wingadal’, his $200m Point Piper home.

“I get up at 5:45 every morning, shower and freshen up. I’m a poor sleeper, I always have been ever since I was a teenager,” Mr Symond said.

“I get up two to three times a night, so it means I’m also an early riser. I also make sure I don’t look at my phone during the night.”

Next, it’s a pit stop at Double Bay for a coffee for half an hour at 6.30am, where he meets with half a dozen of friends he’s collected over the years

“They vary from someone who cleans my car to successful business owners, you name it,” Mr Symond said.

“It’s not a work thing and we talk about anything – headlines, politics, cars. It’s to relax.”

Mr Symond then hits the gym with his personal trainer for 45 minutes, and is home by 8am to freshen up before starting his workday with emails at 9 and his first meeting of the day within his home office by 9.30am.

MATT CARROLL

Matt Carroll steps out in a phone-free cocoon at 6am every day, leaving the mobile at home to walk his dog in the “most beautiful spot in the world”.

The Australian Olympic Committee CEO, who has held a number of high-flying positions over three decades including as CEO of NSW Rugby Union, the Waratahs, the A-League and Australian Sailing, makes a deliberate choice to start the working day free from any distractions.

“I start the morning with a walk down the hill, around the oval and along the boardwalk at Balmoral. It’s the most beautiful spot in the world,” Mr Carroll said.

“Just 30 minutes, with (pet spoodle) Marge, and I don’t take the phone. You see so many people on their phones when they could be enjoying the view.

“I just find it relaxes the brain before getting into the day.”

Mr Carroll, who heads off to work at 7.30 each morning, has announced he will step down during 2025 after five years at the AOC.

KERRIE MATHER

The Venues NSW CEO is a business powerhouse used to smashing through corporate glass ceilings.

After a 25-year career at Macquarie Group, she was appointed Managing Director and CEO at Sydney Airport from 2009 to 2018, when a $3.8 million salary made her one of Australia’s highest paid female executives.

Ms Mather was later appointed CEO of the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust, becoming the first female to hold the position in its 160-year history.

Now as CEO of Venues NSW – a government agency that manages stadiums and entertainment centres – Ms Mathers has a regular routine to start each day.

“I like to start my mornings with a brisk walk,” she said.

“We live in one of the great cities of the world and getting outside to enjoy it is the perfect way to start the day.

“I’m an early riser and too often late-to-bed given the nature of our business. But I wouldn’t have it any other way.

“My favourite early mornings are at the SCG, waiting for the gates to open before the New Year’s Pink Test, with anticipation building and a sense of eerie quiet before the excitement begins.”

WESTPAC CEO ANTHONY MILLER

Sport-loving Westpac CEO Anthony Miller, who took over at the bank pre-Christmas, has been a stickler for routine since his formative years.

“I’m usually up at 5am – swim training in my younger years drilled the early starts into me and they’re hard to drop,” he said.

“These days the exercise routine is a bit more relaxed – a body weight workout, and I’m also trying to change things up by adding a boxing class.

“Then it’s into the office by around 7am, with a double espresso as an essential kickstarter and maybe one more later on if it’s a big day.

“In footy season one of the first things I read on Monday mornings is the rugby league coverage in the Daily Tele to get a good roundup of the weekend’s games.

“Of course, I’ll also skim through the news and finance coverage across papers and online as well.

“During the day I really try to build in half an hour around lunchtime to myself, to think about priorities and focus.”

Mr Miller joined Westpac in 2020 from Deutsche Bank where he was CEO of Australia & NZ and Co-Head of Investment Bank, Asia Pacific.

Earlier in his career he was a partner at Goldman Sachs, joining that company in 2001.

HOME AND AWAY STAR ADA NICODEMOU

There are three non-negotiables for the Home and Away star in the morning- coffee, something to eat and a load of washing on.

“As soon as I wake up I go upstairs and first thing that I do is turn the coffee machine on, then have my probiotic,” she said.

“That’s the one thing that I don’t skip ever, my coffee. I have a double espresso with two dollops of cream and I always make my first one myself.”

Next up it’s the washing and getting her son Johnas up and ready for school.

Then it’s off to work for Nicodemou to play Summer Bay’s Leah Patterson with a 6am call time which kicks off in the makeup chair with coffee number two.

“The make-up room is a great place to be in the morning,” she said.

“It’s always quite loud in there. There’s a lot of laughter and supposedly I’m the loudest. It is a really great way to start the day.”

While Nicodemou dabbles in meditation at home when she can squeeze it in, this year she plans on slowing her morning routine down.

“I don’t do meditation enough,” she said.

“And at the moment, I feel like wonder woman in the morning and I turn up to work exhausted because I’ve already done 15,000 jobs.

“I need to breathe. Slow it down a little.”",0,1738462371.0,aussie,0,0.5,False

1ifmmws,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpalsover30/comments/1ifmmws/34m_usa_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,"34M, USA - Longing for intense and deep connection and elaborate exchange","Salutations!

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and postcards, and would like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to give that to someone else as well.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into the other or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time.

My ideal communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US. I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal - cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences, so I'm more open to people from parts of the world more distinct from my own. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

* I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else. Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life. I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction. Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.
* I'm INTJ and am Type 5. I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Think we could have a great exchange? Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance. If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",1,1738461978.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

1ifmimf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/1ifmimf/market76_faq_best_shotguns_trade_values_and_4star/,"Market76 FAQ: Best Shotguns, Trade Values, and 4-Star Gear Advice","Hey everyone! Seeing a lot of the same questions pop up lately, so here’s a quick rundown of what’s hot in the Market76 scene right now.

**What’s the Best Shotgun Right Now?**

The *Kabloom* is getting a lot of attention, especially with poison builds. Thanks to the Viper’s 4th-star mod, it deals poison damage on hit, which stacks well with certain perk setups. The recent nerf to self-inflicted explosive damage makes it more viable, but the constant poison grunt sounds can be annoying for some players. If you can tolerate that, it’s definitely a strong pick.

**How Much Are Leaders Worth?**

	•	1,000 caps per Leader when buying from a vendor or purchasing with caps.

	•	500 caps per Leader when trading for an item.

**What’s the Value of Coffee?**

	•	Coffee typically sells for 50 caps each.

	•	If you’re trading Leaders for Coffee, expect a 1:10 ratio (one Leader = 10 Coffees).

**Are These Prices Set in Stone?**

Not at all. Price guides are just starting points, but at the end of the day, the market decides. Test your prices, see what sells, and adjust accordingly. Keep an eye on completed trades to get a sense of where demand is.

**What’s a Good 4-Star Armor Set?**

If you’re looking for something fun and effective, try a Thorn armor set with:

	•	OES (Overeater’s)

	•	Toxic Miasma

	•	Everything Hits Me (takes a lot of poison damage but pairs well with Toxic Miasma).

Pair it with Grenadier—it oddly increases Thorn’s hit explosions. Also, running Hack and Slash + Collateral Damage (legendary melee perks) gives you a chance to make enemies explode on melee kills.

For crit builds, running 5x Limit Breakers lets you crit every other shot, instead of every two shots.

**Best 4-Star Mods for Gatling Plasma?**

	•	Damage: Pin-Pointer mod (best for pure DPS).

	•	Survivability: Conductor mod (helps keep you alive).

	•	Best Gun Mods:

	•	Acceleration Nozzle

	•	Stinging Core

	•	Prime Receiver (for raw damage) OR Calibrated Receiver (for crit damage).

**Explosive vs. 25% Faster Fire Rate – Which is Better?**

This comes down to playstyle:

	•	Explosive: Hits harder per shot, works well with Demolition Expert for bonus damage.

	•	25% Faster Fire Rate (25FFR): Dumps bullets fast, making it great for overall DPS.

If you like big damage per shot, go Explosive. If you prefer spraying bullets like crazy, go 25FFR.

Hope this helps! Feel free to drop your own experiences or builds in the comments! ",2,1738461595.0,Market76,1,0.75,False

It almost seemed too good to be true. The landlord, Mr. Thompson, was an older man who barely looked at me as I signed the lease. “It’s a quiet place,” he said. “Not many tenants. You’ll like it.”

I moved in on a Friday. The apartment was small but cozy—two bedrooms, a tiny kitchen, and a living room with an outdated TV. By Saturday morning, I’d already met her.

Her name was Emily. She was sitting on the couch when I woke up, sipping coffee and flipping through a magazine. “Morning,” she said, smiling. “You must be the new tenant.”

She seemed nice. Friendly, but not overbearing. We talked a little, nothing too personal. She told me she’d been living there a while and that the landlord rarely checked in. We fell into an easy routine—coffee in the mornings, TV in the evenings. It felt like I had lucked out with a great roommate.

Until I mentioned her to the landlord.

It was a week later. He had stopped by to drop off some paperwork and asked if everything was alright. I casually brought her up, saying how nice it was to have a good roommate.

He frowned. “You’re the only one on the lease.”

I let out a small laugh. “Yeah, but Emily’s been here for a while, right?”

His face didn’t change. “No one’s lived there for months.”

A cold, creeping feeling spread through my chest. “That’s not possible. I talk to her every day.”

He gave me a strange look. “Are you sure?”

I almost asked him to come inside, to see for himself. But when I turned toward the apartment, the blinds were shut. The living room light was off. I suddenly felt foolish.

“Never mind,” I muttered. “I must’ve misunderstood.”

He nodded slowly, then left. I locked the door behind him and turned to the couch.

Emily wasn’t there. But her coffee cup was. Half-full, steam still rising.

I spent the rest of the afternoon convincing myself that I wasn’t crazy. There had to be an explanation. Maybe she wasn’t on the lease but still lived here. Maybe she was a former tenant who never really left. Or maybe Mr. Thompson was just forgetful.

That night, I sat on the couch, waiting for her to come back. The apartment was silent, the air thick with something I couldn’t quite name. I checked my phone, scrolling mindlessly, trying to distract myself.

Then, the bathroom door creaked open.

I jumped. Emily stepped out, rubbing her hands on a towel. “You okay?” she asked.

I hesitated. “Where were you earlier?”

She frowned. “What do you mean?”

I swallowed hard. “When the landlord came by. You weren’t here.”

She tilted her head. “I was in my room.”

Her room. The second bedroom. I had never gone in there. Something about it felt… off. Like it wasn’t really meant to be mine.

“Look,” she said, sitting next to me. “I know this place is a little weird. But you’ll get used to it.”

“Used to what?”

She smiled, but there was something hollow about it. “Sharing.”

A shiver ran down my spine. I tried to shake it off, but when I glanced down at the coffee table, her cup was gone.

I never saw her move it.

I couldn’t sleep. I lay awake, staring at my ceiling, listening. The apartment was too quiet, like it was holding its breath.

Then, a soft knock.

I sat up, heart pounding. It came from the second bedroom.

I wasn’t going to answer it. But my feet moved before I could stop them. I crossed the hall and pressed my ear to the door.

Silence.

I knocked once. “Emily?”

Nothing.

I turned the knob. The door swung open.

The room was empty.

No bed. No furniture. Just a bare mattress on the floor, covered in dust. The air was thick, stale, like no one had stepped inside for years.

I backed away slowly, but as I did, I caught something in the corner of my eye.

A coffee cup. Sitting in the middle of the floor.

Emily’s coffee cup.

Then, the door slammed shut.

And behind me, someone whispered my name.

I spun around so fast I nearly tripped over my own feet. My back hit the door as I pressed myself against it, heart hammering against my ribs.

The room was empty.

But I wasn’t alone.

I could feel it—something just beyond my line of sight. The air was thick, heavy with a presence I couldn’t explain. My breathing came fast and shallow as I reached for the doorknob behind me. My fingers fumbled, slipping against the cold metal.

Then, the whisper came again. Right next to my ear.

“Why did you open the door?”

I shoved my way out of the room, slamming the door behind me. My hands trembled as I locked it, as if that could somehow keep whatever was inside from getting out.

I stumbled back into the living room, gasping for air. My gaze landed on the couch, on the spot where Emily always sat. It was empty now, but the impression of her body was still there, like someone had been sitting only moments ago.

I turned on every light in the apartment.

Then, I did the one thing I had been avoiding since the landlord’s visit. I grabbed my phone and started searching.

There wasn’t much. The apartment complex wasn’t exactly famous, just an old building that had been through several owners. But then I found it—an old newspaper article from over a decade ago.

A woman had died here.

Her name was Emily.

I stared at the screen, my stomach twisting into knots. The article was brief, just a small blurb in the crime section. ""Emily Graves, 26, was found dead in her apartment after neighbors reported a foul odor. Authorities ruled it a tragic accident, though details remain unclear.""

I shut my phone off. My whole body was shaking.

I wasn’t crazy. Emily was real. But she wasn’t alive.

I needed to leave. Now.

I grabbed my keys and bolted for the front door. My hands fumbled with the lock, my pulse pounding in my ears. But just as I twisted the knob—

The TV turned on.

Static filled the apartment, hissing and crackling. The screen flickered, shadows dancing across the walls.

And there, in the reflection of the darkened screen—

Emily.

She stood behind me, her head tilted, her eyes dark and hollow.

“Why are you leaving?” she whispered.

My scream caught in my throat.

The lights flickered. The air grew thick and cold.

Then, the TV shut off.

And she was gone.

It almost seemed too good to be true. The landlord, Mr. Thompson, was an older man who barely looked at me as I signed the lease. “It’s a quiet place,” he said. “Not many tenants. You’ll like it.”

I moved in on a Friday. The apartment was small but cozy—two bedrooms, a tiny kitchen, and a living room with an outdated TV. By Saturday morning, I’d already met her.

Her name was Emily. She was sitting on the couch when I woke up, sipping coffee and flipping through a magazine. “Morning,” she said, smiling. “You must be the new tenant.”

She seemed nice. Friendly, but not overbearing. We talked a little, nothing too personal. She told me she’d been living there a while and that the landlord rarely checked in. We fell into an easy routine—coffee in the mornings, TV in the evenings. It felt like I had lucked out with a great roommate.

Until I mentioned her to the landlord.

It was a week later. He had stopped by to drop off some paperwork and asked if everything was alright. I casually brought her up, saying how nice it was to have a good roommate.

He frowned. “You’re the only one on the lease.”

I let out a small laugh. “Yeah, but Emily’s been here for a while, right?”

His face didn’t change. “No one’s lived there for months.”

A cold, creeping feeling spread through my chest. “That’s not possible. I talk to her every day.”

He gave me a strange look. “Are you sure?”

I almost asked him to come inside, to see for himself. But when I turned toward the apartment, the blinds were shut. The living room light was off. I suddenly felt foolish.

“Never mind,” I muttered. “I must’ve misunderstood.”

He nodded slowly, then left. I locked the door behind him and turned to the couch.

Emily wasn’t there. But her coffee cup was. Half-full, steam still rising.

I spent the rest of the afternoon convincing myself that I wasn’t crazy. There had to be an explanation. Maybe she wasn’t on the lease but still lived here. Maybe she was a former tenant who never really left. Or maybe Mr. Thompson was just forgetful.

That night, I sat on the couch, waiting for her to come back. The apartment was silent, the air thick with something I couldn’t quite name. I checked my phone, scrolling mindlessly, trying to distract myself.

Then, the bathroom door creaked open.

I jumped. Emily stepped out, rubbing her hands on a towel. “You okay?” she asked.

I hesitated. “Where were you earlier?”

She frowned. “What do you mean?”

I swallowed hard. “When the landlord came by. You weren’t here.”

She tilted her head. “I was in my room.”

Her room. The second bedroom. I had never gone in there. Something about it felt… off. Like it wasn’t really meant to be mine.

“Look,” she said, sitting next to me. “I know this place is a little weird. But you’ll get used to it.”

“Used to what?”

She smiled, but there was something hollow about it. “Sharing.”

A shiver ran down my spine. I tried to shake it off, but when I glanced down at the coffee table, her cup was gone.

I never saw her move it.

I couldn’t sleep. I lay awake, staring at my ceiling, listening. The apartment was too quiet, like it was holding its breath.

Then, a soft knock.

I sat up, heart pounding. It came from the second bedroom.

I wasn’t going to answer it. But my feet moved before I could stop them. I crossed the hall and pressed my ear to the door.

Silence.

I knocked once. “Emily?”

Nothing.

I turned the knob. The door swung open.

The room was empty.

No bed. No furniture. Just a bare mattress on the floor, covered in dust. The air was thick, stale, like no one had stepped inside for years.

I backed away slowly, but as I did, I caught something in the corner of my eye.

A coffee cup. Sitting in the middle of the floor.

Emily’s coffee cup.

Then, the door slammed shut.

And behind me, someone whispered my name.

I spun around so fast I nearly tripped over my own feet. My back hit the door as I pressed myself against it, heart hammering against my ribs.

The room was empty.

But I wasn’t alone.

I could feel it—something just beyond my line of sight. The air was thick, heavy with a presence I couldn’t explain. My breathing came fast and shallow as I reached for the doorknob behind me. My fingers fumbled, slipping against the cold metal.

Then, the whisper came again. Right next to my ear.

“Why did you open the door?”

I shoved my way out of the room, slamming the door behind me. My hands trembled as I locked it, as if that could somehow keep whatever was inside from getting out.

I stumbled back into the living room, gasping for air. My gaze landed on the couch, on the spot where Emily always sat. It was empty now, but the impression of her body was still there, like someone had been sitting only moments ago.

I turned on every light in the apartment.

Then, I did the one thing I had been avoiding since the landlord’s visit. I grabbed my phone and started searching.

There wasn’t much. The apartment complex wasn’t exactly famous, just an old building that had been through several owners. But then I found it—an old newspaper article from over a decade ago.

A woman had died here.

Her name was Emily.

I stared at the screen, my stomach twisting into knots. The article was brief, just a small blurb in the crime section. ""Emily Graves, 26, was found dead in her apartment after neighbors reported a foul odor. Authorities ruled it a tragic accident, though details remain unclear.""

I shut my phone off. My whole body was shaking.

I wasn’t crazy. Emily was real. But she wasn’t alive.

I needed to leave. Now.

I grabbed my keys and bolted for the front door. My hands fumbled with the lock, my pulse pounding in my ears. But just as I twisted the knob—

The TV turned on.

Static filled the apartment, hissing and crackling. The screen flickered, shadows dancing across the walls.

And there, in the reflection of the darkened screen—

Emily.

She stood behind me, her head tilted, her eyes dark and hollow.

“Why are you leaving?” she whispered.

My scream caught in my throat.

The lights flickered. The air grew thick and cold.

Then, the TV shut off.

And she was gone.

I got what I could done, and I did my best today. That's all I'm expecting from myself these days. I can take life slower and enjoy my coffee this evening after I got dinner done for my family. I didn't have to look them in the eye and see the disappointment again when they saw my bloodshot eyes.

I'm present and my mind is clear. Life is not sunshine and rainbows, but I can handle it now!!! Alcohol isn't holding me back telling me I'm no good and nothing matters but another drink.

1ifmdmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1ifmdmx/help_with_adhdnight_shift/,Help with ADHD/night shift,"Hi all, 

I am 11 weeks pregnant and also an ER shift worker (nights, swings, days) luckily so far I had a bit of a break due to one clinic closing and another opening and was able to forego caffeine/energy drinks. I also have ADHD and normally take Ritalin. I stopped Ritalin once I found out I'm pregnant. I am struggling with it but was able to do it when not working. 

  
Now I have to go back to work - and started night shifts and couldn't get through my first night shift without an energy drink. 

Any alternatives I can do? Is it better to be on meds like Ritalin rather than like, energy drinks? 

And yes, I will ask my OB GYN, she had said up to 200 mg caffeine is ok, and said if absolutely needing we can do Ritalin but would prefer not to. Just wanting to hear from other moms and other people's experiences. It's been really hard without my caffeine and ADHD meds but I also can't afford to leave this job (which comes with a neat maternity leave package so I want to hold on... and I like the job) 

I hear from people who have drank caffeine throughout vs. people who cut it out fully so I am torn and confused. I am struggling so partially asking for alternatives/experiences and partially commiserating/venting. 

Also why would coffee be any better than monster as long as I keep it under 200 mg? Or sodas? Is it terrible that I drink it here and then? I won't on my off days and I work 3 days a week. ",1,1738461159.0,pregnant,4,1.0,False

[\[Prev\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1iexu77/convoy_evs_16_1/)\[Next\]

**Memory transcription subject: Captain Fredric J. Walker, United Kingdom Space Command.**

**0800 hours**

I think on one last review before go-time, I like to do this often; it keeps me grounded.

I am the Commanding officer of the Second Escort Group, escorting Convoy Earth to Venlil Space, no.16. The cargo is mostly not cargo, most freighters are carrying only civilians, evacuating Earth. A larger group today, twenty-six merchant vessels flying eleven different flags will be under our care. Split among all the vessels is a small 50,000 or so-sized bite out of the around ten billion souls under threat from the approaching Federation extermination fleet. Realizing that amount of lives is soon to be my responsibility makes me hesitate for a moment, before I straighten myself up. 

Four hours of travel time, what we call a Thunder Run, traveling in-warp as fast as our drives will take us towards the safety of Venlil space. The Sol system and the systems held by the Venlil are like two continents, and the deep space between them is like the open ocean; 

Dangerous. 

Not all Convoys are harassed or harried by Federation raiders, but for every moment of every second of every minute we must be on vigilant watch, in case they decide this is the one they’ll tear out of warp with their disruptors and strike. We have none of the fancy stealth technology afforded to the main fleet vessels, there’s no time and no dock space to add it, and our warp-wake is correspondingly large and easy to detect; they will know where and when we are coming. Therefore, they most certainly have the initiative.

A quick conversation with the fleet, and an even quicker breakfast later, I stand in the CIC with my sippy cup full of strong coffee; it would just float out of a normal mug. The taste is like rubber, and the temperature scalds my tongue and the roof of my mouth. Just how I like it. 

There’s not much for me to do at the moment, aside from hovering over the shoulders of the crew on deck, checking their various displays and instruments. We are once again floating in orbit, this time around Jupiter. The Convoy itself is due to arrive any minute now, and the escorts have all formed up and sounded off, ready as they’ll ever be. These moments of calm are welcome, but they’re also when your brain will be the most unhelpful. With nothing to occupy your hands and thoughts, there’s nothing to distract you from your stress at the upcoming trials. Tens of thousands of lives are at stake, and tens of thousands of families depend on us for the safekeeping of their fathers and their mothers, their sons and their daughters, it is both sobering and humbling.

“Captain, we’re being hailed.” The coms-officer suddenly speaks up. “Should I put it through?”

“Yes, please-” I respond, turning my attention to the video screen to my right. A couple of seconds of lag later, a new face that I haven’t seen before pops into view. The man is in his mid-thirties, short and stout, and wears an expression of civility, mixed with the usual weariness becoming of an officer. His American uniform, confusingly, bears the rank of colonel with the dash afforded to a Wing Commander, and his name on the tag is Langley. Wing Commander Langley.

“Captain Walker speaking, what is this about?  I am about to depart for FTL and am a bit low on time at the moment.” I hope that doesn’t come off as rude to who I think is an American, the accent causes problems like that sometimes, but it’s not wrong as this *is* crunch time.

More waiting, his ship must be a decent clip from our current position with this type of delay. “Sir. Col- Wing Commander Langley here, it’s actually about that. I am in command of the Bogue-class escort carrier, USV Copahee. Sorry for the lack of heads up, I was just assigned to your flotilla at the last minute; I’m burning towards your position as we speak. This is EVS 16, correct? I would be honoured to join your force for the coming journey, me and the scouts my vessel carries.”

“And we would be honoured to have you. Our position seems to be known already, but if you require an update I’ll have the helm send it over coms. Welcome to EVS 16, Wing Commander Langley.” An entire escort carrier, with a compliment of scout and light attack snub craft in the low double digits, joining my force. I have to wonder for a second whose palms I must have greased recently to give me this much support, with no discernible conditions. “...I do need to ask, why this sudden addition, so soon to departure? Why was I not informed of this earlier?”

He grimaces, bad news or at least a complication is at foot. I hate complications, but it remains to be seen if I love the additional scouting capacity of the Bogue class enough to offset that. “Yes, about that, there has been an important addition to the passenger list of a freighter that will be joining us; they are the new additions to the UN delegation to the Venlil Republic.”

*Oh good God.* 

“I… see. I assume this was an emergency, it has to be for them to play *this* fast and *this* loose with regulations. Which vessel is carrying them?”

“That uh… that’s the thing Sir, the head of the Delegation specifically forbade me from telling you, under threat of court-martial.”

“Ah.” The reasoning makes sense, favouring one vessel at the expense of the others is both unfair and disrespectful to the crews, even if there are VIP’s involved. “Well, in that case, nothing has changed. We will be as thorough and vigilant as with any run. Will there be anything else, Langley?”

“No, not that I can think of, Sir.”

“In that case, don’t break your crew from warp-prep when you arrive, we will be leaving as soon as you get here assuming the Convoy is on time. Godspeed, Wing Commander.”

“Thank you, Sir, over and out.”

The video cuts out. From what little I could discern from the man, he seems capable and competent, if a mite nervous about his position. Completely reasonable, given the circumstances, and I do believe his performance will be more than up to snuff. 

“Nav, give me the location and course of drive-signature ACV-12, please.” I turn my attention back to the IRST and ELINT displays, watching the arrow on the projected path of the Convoy inch closer. That path is joined by a second, the USV Copahee’s, approaching from the major dockyard in high geosynchronous Mars orbit. The Convoy is projected to arrive a little bit in advance of the Copahee, but the delay from when we’ll be able to depart will be minimal. 

Staying on schedule, which is of utmost importance for ensuring UNFFCOM (UN fleet forces command) has a good track on our location and can bail us out if the going gets rough, will still be more than possible, barring any more unfortunate *complications*. I’m still a mite crossed at the fact they did not give me any warning as to the importance of the passengers in my care, but I cannot let myself put any priority, even subconsciously, on them over any of the other passengers; I am quite glad Langley did not tell me their vessel. Unsurprisingly, the little number counting drive-sigs next to the Convoy has gone from 26 yesterday to 27 today, the extra now accounted for.

I type out a quick message, **{ACV-12 TO JOIN FLOTILLA SMALL DELAY ON DEPARTURE STOP ONE EXTRA MERCHANT JOINING CONVOY STOP NO CHANGE IN COVER-FORMATION ACV-12 WILL BE WITH CONVOY STOP}**, and send it off to the rest of the flotilla. Now all that is left to do is wait for both of them to arrive, and I think a second cup of coffee will do me well.

“Ford, take watch for a moment, and inform me if the Convoy or the Copahee arrive ahead of schedule.”

“Aye Sir.”

I make sure my magboots are well connected to the floor, then head off in the direction of the mess. Again I turn them off and float up the middle of the stairwell, careful to stick to the blue-coded side to avoid slamming into someone going the opposite way. Getting used to receiving salutes and not giggling, even a little bit, when the other party was upside down relative to me took some serious work on my part, but now I have it down to a science. Some would say that’s me sucking the fun out of everything, I say that it’s just being respectful. 

Arriving in the mess, I trade more salutes and acknowledge more ratings politely as I drift and then walk towards the coffee machine at the far side of the room. It’s fairly large, the Javelin has a full complement of 50 naval personnel and 27 Royal Marines, three squads of eight and a command group of three officers, so the mess needs to be decently sized. I’m careful to close the lid on the drinking tube on my sippy cup and make sure there’s a tight seal between the refilling tube and the coffee machine before I press the buttons for it to dispense the liquid gold. Coffee acquired, it’s back to the CIC for me. Same process as before, although this time I stick to the red-coded side. Arriving, I relieve Ford and check the docket he’s prepared for me in my absence. It’s the Sackville, more trouble with their drive, and the Copahee is going to be twenty minutes late. 

Such is command, running from one fire to the next. “Coms, get McKinley on the horn, now please.”

It’s a longer delay till he picks up and as I wait I send another quick message via Coms fleet-wide, **{DELAY TO 20 MINS STOP}**, before McKinley’s face appears on the screen, crows-feet quite apparent on his forehead. He heads the corvette group and himself is extremely reliable, but his ship the HMCV Sackville is quite famously not. She’s been run down to the bone, but there is yet again no time and no space in the docks to get her overhauled. McKinley himself has repeatedly refused to transfer command, most likely worrying that a greener captain will be given his ship, a captain that does not know her ins and outs, a captain that will get himself and his crew stranded.

More complications.

“McKinley here, go for it Capn’.”

“Commander. Is or is your vessel not going to be ready to depart?”

The thick Newfoundland accent bleeds heavily into his speech,  “Oh she’s just havin’ the usual trub’ with the electrics shortin’. She’ll be all good to go, I got the greasemonkeys in Eng working double-quick on her.”

“Are you absolutely positive, Commander? I do *not* want to have to abandon you during the run.”

“Aye yep positive as I’ll ever be, I give ‘em 5-10ish till they have it tip-top I’d say.”

“Splendid, Godspeed Commander.”

“Ya b’y. To you too, Capn’.” 

I hang up, and just in time to watch the dancing patterns of light appear on the IRST as the massive Freighters of the Convoy begin to jump in, out of warp. 

Swirling, beautiful patterns of light, like the sky in a Van Gogh, appear and disappear with each fresh arrival. Each dive signature has its own unique pattern, like snowflakes, lasting about as long as a melting snowflake too. 1, 2, 5, 16, 23, 24, and finally 27 as they begin to rotate and form up into their pack, each ship slightly out of direction and off-kilter post-jump from their low-tech drives. Massive, hulking vessels, the smallest easily three times the Javelin’s length, their RCS thrusters have a correspondingly long burn time to overcome the inertia of their broad movements.

“Sir we’re being hailed.” Says Coms. That’ll be the Master of the Convoy, a civilian from the Merchant Marine. There are very, very few people I respect more than the members of the Merchant Marine, volunteering for dangerous and unforgiving work, with terrible pay. Even if some of them are only doing it to get a ticket into space, they’re still braver than many, braver than most. 

“Put it through.”

An elderly woman, missing an ear, pops onto the screen. Her gaze is firm and knowledgeable but warm all the same. Tea with her would probably be very comforting.

I nod my head in respect “Ma’am. Captain Walker speaking.”

She nods back. “And I am Captain Saengarun, pleased to make your acquaintance. I report that my Freighters and their crews are ready to go when needed, after we charge our drives. We are in your hands.”

“And we will keep you safe to the best of our Abilities.” With that, She cuts the call.

“Coms, give me the intercom please. Nav, if you’d be so kind, please start the updates to the jump calculations and begin charging the drive. And Coms relay that order to the rest of the Flotilla. ” There’s a small burst of static noise, and the ensign signals that I’m being put through. The navigation officers begin compiling the massive amount of data through the ship’s computer, and one gives me the thumbs-up to signal all good so far.

*“Ahem-* All hands, General quarters, prepare for warp.” I give the signal to begin locking down every loose item aboard the vessel, as well as for the crew to ready themselves for the jump. Most are experienced enough at this point to not get The Spins, but some of the Marine compliment might lose their lunches if they don’t take the requisite pills. I’d like to preferably have the fleet completely ready to go for FTL, right as the Copahee arrives, minimizing the delay from her tardiness, but also not charging the drive too early which would waste a significant amount of fuel maintaining the charge. Not enough to threaten our ability to make the jump to Venlil Space, but it would waste time having us refuel for longer over there, which would cut into the budget for delays for the return jump. As with everything, it is a balancing act between two extremes, I relate more in this profession to a tightrope walker than I’d think.

“*Yawn*\- Captain.” And speaking of tightrope walkers; Woken from one of his narcoleptic naps, Johnson ‘Gator’ Summers sleepily enters the CIC, and I acknowledge his salute. Conditional Narcolepsy is extremely common in jump navigators due to their exposure to the warp bubble, which they have to carefully watch from the so-called ‘crows-nest’, one of the few places with an actual physical porthole to the void instead of a camera linked to a screen. This is to ensure that, no matter power fluctuations or temporary blackouts, they can see if the jump needs to be terminated in an emergency, potentially saving the vessel and crew from spaghettification. Luckily for the fleet, the condition of the Conditional Narcolepsy is that it does not affect the navigations when underway in-warp. Gator walks up the stairs in the CIC to his post, we’re in good hands with him, he was one of the first to go train with the Venlil Space Corps.

At that moment, the Copahee arrives. Above and to the left of the Convoy, her drive signature explodes onto the IRST screen and then disappears as quickly as it came as the vessel herself maneuvers into her position among the freighters. Escort carriers are mostly unarmed apart from the usual PD, but her strength lies not in her firepower. Wing Commander Langley’s Communication Officer relays their preparedness to jump, having overcharged their drive for the relatively short distance from Mars.

“Coms, give me the intercom please.” The officer signals to go ahead. “*Ahem*\- All hands, prepare for jump, all stations sound off.”

The replies come in short order.

“Coms ready!”

“Engineering is ready.”

“Navigation is ready.”

“I’ve got good tone and feel from the bubble, so far.” Gator reports, from his isolated position watching the porthole.

“Gunnery reports all weapons stowed for jump, we are ready.”

“This is Leftenant Andrew, my marines are strapped up and medicated, there'll be no repeat of last jump's... unpleasantness. *Sorry again Janitor.*”

All good to go on the Javelin, and the rest of the ships and the Convoy’s Master all signal green. 

“Coms, please give me the Flotilla.” Another signal to go ahead.

“All vessels, prepare for jump on my mark."" Engineering deploys the Javelin's outriggers, which interface with the forming warp bubble, keeping it locked down and stable as it takes shape.

I lick my lips one last time. ""Five, four, three, two, one, mark!”

The Heavens spill themselves apart on the IRST screen before the feed is cut, to protect the sensors.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1ifm5ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ifm5ux/i_work_in_a_hotel_and_theres_something_odd_on_the/,"I work in a hotel, and there's something odd on the cameras.","My name is Andrew, I’ve only worked here a few months, and one of the first things they taught me was to always keep my eyes on the cameras. You never know when something is going to pop up that you need to take notes on. Most of the time there’s nothing interesting, just people running to the pool, or getting ice, running to the gas station next door, or just leaving to go to the Applebees. Dollarita’s were back when I started so that’s where most people were. The first month flew by, simple easy, we don’t have a very large hotel, only 4 floors, and like 60 rooms. When I started, we had a lot of stay overs, and a couple of university teams. Essentially, only ever about 30 people in the hotel at a time. We also have a lot construction crews that stay with us while they work on site. 

Most of the crews that stay are really cool guys. Your average dude bros, drinking beer smoking cigs and shooting the shit. At this point the hotel is really slow, it’s after Christmas so everyone is either home or at a different work site, so they aren’t staying with us. The hotel is quiet, dark, and cold. The breathing kind of cold, the sort that comes and goes, filling you with warmth in a kind of exhale, and then inhaling the warmth right out of your body. It’s the beginning of January, so I get that it’s cold. It hasn’t been higher than 35 for the last 2 weeks, a lot of people wanting to come and stay just to avoid the cold. So, my eyes are on the cameras like glue to make sure no one is up to anything nefarious. 

Week 1. We only have 7 check ins today so a pretty boring 8 hours. All of them are prepaid and the paperwork is all done. So, easy. I fill up my water bottle, and I sit down with my Jersey Mikes sub. Can’t resist the Danny DeVito sponsorship. As I’m eating, I look up at the camera screen, here comes a lady with a small Shih Tzu. We don’t allow pets at the hotel, so I get up to go talk to her, leaving my sandwich behind. As she enters, I stop her. 

 

“Ma’am I’m sorry but we don’t allow pets in the hotel, do you have a reservation?”

“I do, I’m a diamond member, I think we can let it slide.”

“No ma’am I don’t think we can let it slide, what’s the name on the reservation?”

“Margaret Thompson. I think my husband made the reservation.”  
  


Her husband had made the reservation, and he was coming in right behind her. I look up and I tell her I’m sorry, we don’t allow pets, you’ll have to find a new hotel. I won’t bore you with the lengthy dialogue, suffice to say she’s a Karen bitch, and she’s not staying at this hotel. After about 20 minutes of fighting her, I make my way back to my sandwich. I get two bites in and here we go again, the phone rings. I hop up and run to the phone and answer, it’s another worker needed a block of rooms. We’re pretty empty so I get it done no problem. I’m on the phone with him long enough that I need to make my way over to check the pool. Inhale. A sharp and bitter cold rushes up my spine and stabs into my body. I don’t know if it’s just the shock of the temperature change or because of something real but I feel like I’m being watched. I grab the hotel master key and run to the pool. Between the hot tub and the pool, the room is humid and warm, constantly sits at around 75. One of the few rooms where sound exists, if not only because of the echo. You can hear everything in there, as I walk around and check the chairs for towels, I can hear my heartbeat. Fast and anxious, trying to warm myself from the cold shock. I finish up and brace myself before walking into the hall. I sing a loud high note, I like to hear it bounce off the walls and the water.

I walk down the hall a bit to the fitness center. A simple room with basic equipment, a small trash can that the guests can throw their towels in. I walk in, check the can, walk out. As I walk out and enter in hall, I hear the familiar beat of heart. I stop, I’m not in the pool where did that come from? I chalk it up to just a trick of the mind and go back to the desk, I have a sandwich to finish. 

The rest of the check in’s go off without a hitch. Everyone gets in and there are no issues. I change the channel from The 700 Club to AMC, they’re playing The Green Mile. It plays at least once a day, but I don’t mind that movie can make me cry every single time. “Please boss, don’t put that thing over my face, don’t put me in the dark. I’s afraid of the dark.” Niagara Falls every time. I sit in the chair and scroll on my phone until the end of my shift. I take little notes, as there wasn’t much that happened. I walk out of the office, and I make my way to the door, and I stop. Exhale, my goosebumps fade, my hair lays flat, and my heart slows. 

I arrive the next day, 15 check ins today. Mostly people still here from Christmas vacation. A pretty nice day, I stay good and busy. Between the phone calls and the check ins I have very little time to sit down until around 10:30. I finally have the chance to really get a good look at the cameras. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. Who is that on the third floor. There’s a man standing there at the far end of the hall almost sitting on the AC unit by the window. I run to check our in-house guests to see who is up on the third floor. There’s about five people up there, two families and three single people. Ok maybe it’s just someone who needed some space from family or just wanted out of their room for a bit. I sit and stare for at least 20 minutes. An unmoving man, just standing there, no expression, not playing on his phone, or anything just glaring straight back at the camera. The desk bell dings ripping me back out of the world of the unmoving man. I look up at the clock, 10:31.

The next day I come in, nothing too crazy only a few check ins so a chill and quiet night. I play on my phone for the most part and chat with some of the workers who stay here. As the day winds on it hits about 7:00 time to change the coffee. I grab the pots and march over to the kitchen. As I pour out the pots, I hear a faint singing from the second floor. I walk up to the second floor and check both ends of the hall. Nothing, but I still hear the singing, it’s above me again. I debate if I should let it slide or chase it. While it’s not too late many of the workers work night shift so they sleep until 11.  I head up in the elevator to tell them to knock it off and go to bed, and when I get there, everything is silent. It’s cold and humid, there’s a kind fog rolling across the floor. That can’t be right. The whole floor is dead silent. Not a sound from the AC units or from any of the 5 people staying on the floor. I step off the elevator and the chill shoots up my spine. Inhale. I can feel the air pulling against my shins. As the air finally slows to a stop a feel a mist roll over my eyes. I still don’t remember everything that happened on the third floor that day, and even writing about it now my head hurts trying to remember it. All I know is the mist came and then suddenly I was back in the kitchen pouring the coffee pots out again. 

The singing was gone, all that was left was the wind outside and the soft hum of the florescent lights. I finish the coffee and come back to the front desk. I go down my list to check everything off. Out of the corner of my eye I see some movement on the camera. He’s back. But only for a moment and he walks off into the stairwell. I quickly switch the camera to see where he went. I glimpse him running down the stairs as fast as he can, past the second floor. I run out to catch him on the first floor. I run down to the entrance and nothing, nothing outside either. I turn around and I see him, on the complete other side of the hotel than where he was. His face on the other side of the door, not glaring anymore, smiling. Beaming even. I stand there holding his gaze for as long as I can reasonably explain to my boss. When I move to get back to the front desk his face darts away from the door. For the rest of my shift, I can’t bring myself to look at the cameras. I can’t convince myself to look, no matter how many things I see move or shift, how many shadows I see dart across. 

Thankfully the weekend passes and nothing else happens. The cameras are clear, not a single shape, shadow, person, no singing. I make it to Monday. I sit down in my boss’s office I must ask her about this. 

“Hey Tracy, got a question for you!”

“Ok, shoot.”

“So, I’ve been seeing some weird stuff on the cameras. Do you know if the hotel is haunted or am I just crazy?”

“You’re crazy”

“Really?”

“I’ve been working here in this hotel for 20 years and not once in that time I have never heard anyone, myself included talk about ghosts in this hotel. You’re crazy.”

“That’s not possible there’s no way that no one has ever said anything about ghosts this is a hotel! At the very least they’d make some connection to The Shining”

“I’m telling you right now, there’s no ghosts here. If you’re seeing something in the cameras maybe go to a therapist.”

“You’re probably right, I mean if no one else has ever mentioned it.”

I just shrugged defeated and looked at her. She looked back her eyes darting from me to the camera screen. Until she finally sighs and gets up to leave. She’d only been here an hour. After that she never spent much time around me at work. If I worked a morning shift, she would come in until the very end, and If I worked afternoon, she’d leave 20 minutes before I’d get there. I asked my coworker about it one day. They wouldn’t answer, just said that Tracy didn’t talk to them much anymore. ",4,1738460479.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

What are they doing?
How can I describe this except as a feeling of insanity, ripping little fibers of my brain, stripping every strand of you away, and closely examining the choices that led to this? It’s giving me anxiety. Or maybe that’s just the coffee.
Either way, here I am again, obsessing, writing about you. I can say, truly, I have never felt this way about a person. And I don’t dare call this love.I am fixated on the fact that I can’t fix this.I can’t make it right.Because, in all honesty, I don’t want to.
I feel hurt too. I don’t feel heard. Maybe that’s why I won’t let go—because I want closure. 
I want my pain to be acknowledged. I need you to hear how you made me feel.
But you won’t listen—because of all the harm I did to you.Fair.
A whirlpool of pain.Of action causing equal and opposite reaction.
Going nowhere, destined to dissipate into a greater body of water—pieces of us floating away, taking forms unknown to either of us.Eventually evaporating, carried even farther away.
I suppose the natural thing to do is go with the flow. Right?
Let the cycle complete itself.Let go.

1ifm1d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ifm1d0/treatments_question/,Treatments question,"I long time ago I was on something that actually slowed my thoughts to I assume normal levels. It was amazing. Felt weird and hated it at first. But once I got used to not have like 50 thoughts going at once, I loved how much easier it was to get back onto task after interruptions or even come up with ideas without feeling overwhelmed. 

I miss it. Life bs happened and too much time passed. My records are gone, the clinic I was at no longer exists. It is now back to trial and error. 

However I am unable to get back on medication yet for financial reasons. It has been making my life feel way too difficult on a day to day. 

I want to try over counter suggestions to at least manage the symptoms while I wait. But I can't find any useful info online. Most of it says all things worsen adhd symptoms or has no effect. No clue how true that is. 

The few things I saw that could help are supplements, lots of caffeine from tea or coffee, and exercising more.

I am hesitant and rather get input from others with adhd first. As caffeine tends to make me nearly fall over sleepy. If I drink a soda at work I struggle to hold my eyes open and tend to catch myself dozing suddenly. 

The adhd has been making work very difficult. When down to part time just to help me regulate. But I can't keep these short hours cause I won't be able to afford what I need for treatments. But at fulltime I can get very disregulated to the point I cry at work from the overwhelm. It's bad. 

I really need to find a temporary solution while waiting for medication again. Any advice is very much appreciated. ",0,1738460082.0,ADHD,1,0.5,False

Is my landlord taking advantage of me? Am I about to be evicted and become homeless??","My landlord is trying to raise the rent by a third, above lha and what I can afford. And while I was looking at my tenancy agreement regarding rent increase (absolutely nothing about it is mentioned in there), I've noticed something I didn't really paid attention at the time:
""The Tenant acknowledges that this tenancy is not an assured or an assured shorthold tenancy."" Is this actually legal/a fair term? 

Context: I rent a room above a pub and there are between 4 and 7 of us at any given time, some of us renting, some have it as part of their ""salary"" for working downstairs. The landlord on the contract is officially the company owning the pub, which is about to be bought out by another company. However, I paid rent to an individual (who I refer to my landlord, as he's the owner of the current company)

I'm also realising that I've never received anything regarding my security deposit being actually secured/protected anywhere. But nothing about this is mentioned in my contact either.

I've been having some issues with the inexistent ""health and safety"" of this place (I've been locked in twice with no way to escape, others have suffered from this too, mould in the bathroom, bathroom light that took over 4 months to get fixed, rats/mice, shared spaces being absolutely filthy, no light in the hallway (over two steps) since last summer, no smoke detector/fire alarm, we even got a hornet nest in the kitchen, etc etc)

I'm scared, and have been for a while, that the landlord would find any reason to evict me and fail to pay me back my deposit. He's already done this to two ex-housemates, by falsely accusing them of damages that were there before to get them to pay for redecorating. I'm now scared of leaving my room, even for a couple of hours, especially because he has a double of the keys (and I know someone has entered my room once while I was away as that person randomly commented on my coffee machine, but I don't actually have any formal proof of that).

My plan is to call both my local council to start with, to explain the situation and check if there's a valid hmo licence, and to shelter, first thing on Monday morning. However my landlord already texted me 5 times in 4h this morning, pressing for an answer by Monday, claiming he'll sort out the paperwork then, as he'll be around (he does NOT live on the promises). This isn't the first time this kind of things happens, earlier this year we were given less than 12h notice, on a Sunday night, for a random landlord inspection.

Thanks for any advice :)

For some time now, I’ve been using eye contact in order to know which women want me to speak to them and which ones to avoid, so basically if there is eye contact, I smile and if they smile back, I take it as a yes, which has been positive on most occasions. 

I noticed, for example, walking down the street or in a coffee shop, the times in which I was on the lookout for eye contact, most women would be turning the other way, or as if they did not see me at all. As reference, I am not an ugly guy, on the contrary, women have told me I am very attractive, maybe I would consider myself an 8-8.5. I would say maybe 99% of women do not make eye contact or do as if they do not notice me at all, which I understand a lot of them would not be interested, but it can’t be that many. 

The last couple of weeks, I did the oposite, when I saw a woman walking down the street in my direction, I would do as if I did not notice her at all (basically same thing I was experiencing) and I could perceive how a lot of those women would be staring VERY discretely at me, but they were staring. In a lot of those occasions, I would look at them when I felt they were staring at me and they were, most of them turning their head the other way or looking down, which I would take as a sign of interest.

Before we jump into Lesson 3 let’s take a quick breather and look back at what we’ve covered so far. These first two lessons are all about building a solid foundation for working with energy and the Grid. Think of it like learning to ride a bike, you need balance and a feel for the handlebars before you can hit the trails. Let’s make sure everything clicks before moving on.

Here’s what we’ll cover
	
1.	Lesson 1 Recap, how to sense energy without forcing it
	
2.	Lesson 2 Recap, understanding the Grid, your cosmic Wi-Fi
	
3.	FAQs, answers to common questions and mix-ups
	
4.	Why We Taught It This Way, no fluff just the good stuff
	
5.	Putting It All Together, how Lessons 1 and 2 team up for real-world application

Lesson 1 Recap, Feeling Energy Naturally

Lesson 1 was about ditching the idea that energy work is complicated or mystical. It’s not. It’s like noticing your own heartbeat, subtle but totally there once you tune in.

Key takeaways

You’re not making energy happen, you’re noticing what’s already around you
Stop overthinking, the harder you try the less you’ll feel
Your body’s already wired for this, you just forgot how to listen
Breathing and staying calm are your secret weapons

Why this matters

If you skip this step everything else feels like pushing a rope. Sensing energy is the foundation. No shortcuts.

Lesson 2 Recap, The Grid, Reality’s Backstage Pass

The Grid isn’t sci-fi. It’s the invisible network that connects everything like the strings on a puppet. You’re part of it, not separate from it.

Key takeaways

The Grid is everywhere, you’re in it right now
It’s got currents like rivers and hotspots like Wi-Fi dead zones or sweet spots
Emotions, memories, and even that weird vibe in your aunt’s basement, the Grid holds it all
Work with it, not against it. Fighting the flow is exhausting

Why this matters

Once you see how energy moves and connects you stop forcing things. You start flowing.

FAQs, Your Burning Questions Answered

What if I still don’t feel anything

Totally normal. Sensitivity takes time. Think of it like learning to taste wine, at first it’s just grape juice. Keep practicing. Relax. Breathe.

Is the Grid real or just a metaphor

Both. Science calls it quantum fields or bioelectricity. Mystics call it the Akashic records or Qi. The labels don’t matter. Your experience does.

What’s the difference between my energy and the Grid

You’re a single wave in the ocean. The Grid is the whole sea. You’re both unique and part of something bigger.

Can science measure the Grid

Sort of. We can track heart-brain coherence or electromagnetic fields but the full picture is still a mystery, and that’s okay.

Why do my moods mess with my energy

Emotions are energy with a vibe. Ever walked into a room where someone’s pissed. That’s emotional static. Clean up your inner noise and perception gets clearer.

What if energy feels scary or heavy

Don’t panic. It’s either you trying too hard so chill out or a dense patch of Grid like a fog bank. Observe, don’t fight.

Why We Taught It This Way

Some folks ask why start with sensing let me do stuff. Here’s why

You can’t paint in the dark. Sensing energy is turning on the lights
Unlearn first. Dump the magic wand myths. Energy work is more like gardening, patient, observant, and kind of dirty
Strong roots equal strong tree. Master perception now and later techniques will feel effortless

Putting It All Together, Your Energy Playbook

Now that you’ve got the basics let’s blend Lessons 1 and 2 into something you can use.

Grounding 2.0, Feel the Grid

Sit quietly. Notice energy in your body, tingles, warmth, pressure
Now expand your focus. Feel how your energy blends with the room, the air, the chair. You’re not pulling energy, you’re tuning into a station that’s already playing

Go With the Flow

Close your eyes. Imagine energy around you like a river. Don’t swim against it. Let it carry you
Notice how your mood shifts the current. Stressed, the river rages. Calm, it’s a lazy Sunday float

Energy Radar

Practice sensing energy beyond your body. Hold your hand near a plant. Hover over your phone. Feel the difference. Walls feel dense. Open spaces buzz.

This is where the rubber meets the road. You’re not just feeling energy anymore, you’re dancing with it. Keep it simple. Stay curious. And remember, the Grid isn’t out there. It’s in your coffee cup, your cat, and the weirdly warm spot by your front door.",2,1738459194.0,Psionics,0,1.0,False

1ifln9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ifln9l/quitting_caffeine_tomorrow/,Quitting Caffeine tomorrow,"Tomorrow will be the last day I consume caffeine. After that, it's over - for good, or at least for many years. I've taken this step before: I quit in 2021 and didn't drink caffeine for a year and a half. At the time, however, I didn't know that chocolate also contains caffeine, which is why I continued to consume it unconsciously. Nevertheless, giving it up had a noticeably positive effect on me.

I have been suffering from an anxiety disorder for about six to seven years. In 2021, I made two big changes: I cut out caffeine and started eating a big breakfast in the morning with lots of protein and fat and few carbohydrates. Together, these two things significantly reduced my anxiety. I was able to lead a normal life again - before, it was often difficult for me to go to parties, open up and socialize. In my youth, all of this was easy for me, but when I was 19, I suddenly developed severe anxiety, which was probably also related to excessive cannabis use in my teenage years.

I also underwent therapy at the time, which helped me in many areas - but it couldn't take away my anxiety. It was giving up caffeine and changing my diet that made the decisive difference. Nevertheless, I wasn't completely free of anxiety and many people noticed that I seemed shy. I was told this again and again and it really annoyed me over time.

After a year and a half without caffeine in 2023, I decided to start drinking it occasionally again - maybe once a week. I wanted to find out if I could enjoy it in moderation without my anxiety returning. I also didn't want to set myself so many strict rules because I'm generally a rather compulsive person. I thought a little more freedom and ease might do me good.

But I quickly realized that it wasn't working. On the days when I consumed caffeine, my anxiety increased immediately. I usually spent these days alone because I didn't feel like meeting up with others. Without caffeine, on the other hand, I had no problems being socially active.

The worst thing is that this phase of ""occasional consumption"" has been going on for two years now - and I didn't even realize how long it had been going on. I kept telling myself: ""A few more times, then I'll stop."" But I kept putting it off. This cycle frustrates me enormously. I now realize that it's a real addiction and I don't want to be trapped in this pattern anymore.

I've been taking an antidepressant for my anxiety since last summer and it has improved my life massively. I'm back in the flow, I date a lot, I can go to parties without any problems, I've settled in well in my new city and I've even joined a soccer club. The best thing about it is that other people no longer perceive me as shy. I am simply myself.

But despite the positive development, I still notice that caffeine sets me back. Every time I drink it, the anxiety comes back and I withdraw again. That's why I'm determined to end this cycle for good. Tomorrow I'll have my last coffee - after that it's over.

I'm writing this post because I think it's great to have a community here that shares my experiences. For a long time I thought I was alone with this problem, but that's not true.

The pros and cons of caffeine for me

Disadvantages:
	- Increased anxiety
	- Restless sleep
	- General inner restlessness

Advantages (which made me fall off the wagon again and again):
	- Euphoria and feelings of happiness
	- Creative flow - I'm studying something creative and caffeine has often helped me to be productive for hours on end
	- Less time wasted - with caffeine I am often more motivated to be active
	- The ritual of drinking coffee - sitting in a café, enjoying a coffee with friends, indulging in something

But I've realized that some things can't simply be replaced. Just as a cigarette can't be replaced one-to-one with something else, I miss something when I give up coffee. But that doesn't mean I should keep drinking it.

What I have noticed in particular is that caffeine puts you into a kind of tunnel vision, almost like a daze. You simply don't see many things - especially negative ones. It almost feels a bit like living in a kind of ""matrix"". I notice this particularly in relation to my creative work. I'm working on building my own fashion brand and when I drink caffeine, I'm totally on fire. I can work for hours on end, I'm full of energy and absolutely convinced that my brand will be successful.

But as soon as I stop drinking caffeine, I'm in a completely different state. I become more realistic - or perhaps more pessimistic. Suddenly I think: the market is huge, there are countless Instagram fashion brands that will never be successful. There's already far too much clothing out there anyway - so what makes my brand different? It feels like a harsh reality check that I get every time I'm without caffeine. And I've already read on Reddit forums that others feel the same way.

The interesting thing is that around 80% of people drink caffeine every day. Maybe that's why most of them are in this trance-like state - full of energy, but with a distorted view of reality. And to be honest, I can totally understand that. I also find this state pleasant. In a way, it even makes me sad that I now have to let it go. But there's no other way.

Another point that strikes me when giving up is sleep. Without caffeine, I can easily sleep for twelve to 13 hours, sometimes even more. I often feel the need to lie down for several hours after university. Of course, this could also be related to the withdrawal phase, perhaps it will settle down after a few months. But it could also be a side effect of my medication. It was different with caffeine - I slept for seven to eight hours and was more awake during the day. Of course, sleep is great, but twelve hours a day is just too much.

That's why the time has come: I'm quitting.

 I finish inspecting the cameras, and give Lara a thumbs up that she affirms she sees over the intercom. I open the door and pat my nervous eyed, nude sister on her left shoulder as I pass her again.

Nothing to do but make small talk until Mary gets here. Lara tells me about how the Mirror Universe skit they did for Sheila's first fan service vid was inspiring a possible storyline that would involve a risky plan to use ruthless Star Hegemony Officers from the other Universe to beat the Amazonion/N'Docc Alliance. They'd be Officers presumed dead, but ones who were blown up or no body was found, so a cover story could be concoted. I was starting to see why she was bringing Mary back. But nothing prepared me for the sight of her when she came in view of the passageway camera.

She was wearing  black pants, blouse and jackboots uniform, with a black combination cap. The armband has a picture of a black hand fixing to close around some well rendered stars of various colors, presumably the core worlds of the Star Hegemony. She has her blond hair tied back in a severe bun, and a harsh scowl etched on her face. Poor Sheila.

Then I notice the holstered flogger on her hip. Suede leather, which is common material for floggers, but with a minute amount of metal added at the tips to make it just a little more painful. Och, now I really feel bad for poor Sheila. It was surreal to see the foam coffee tray with three cups balanced in the black gloved  hand of this vision of interstellar facism.

She stops in between the door and the camera, then suprisingly turns and sticks something to the wall with her left hand, the right balancing the coffee. Presumably a sticker of some kind, whatever it was, it couldn't be good for Slave Zero.

Then she looks right at the camera, her scowl turns into a smile, and she holds her finger to her lips in a ""Shhhh"" gesture. Then she actually winks. I am suprised at her brazeness, but I had left the door unlocked in anticipation of something like this and Lara knew it. It sucks for Sheila, but all four of us know a domme has every right to set up a slave for a nasty suprise. Ari taught us the purpose of that was to keep slaves off balance and submissive. A slave too used to a routine could get funny ideas...like rebellion or escape. I text her.

Mistress Sandy: Come on in Mary, the door's unlocked.

Mistress Mary: Thank you Sandy.

We watch on the laptop screen as she seems to almost goose step to the door, coffee in hand. In the next instant, I hear a shocked squeal as the door is flung open, even watch her adorable little buttocks reflexively clench. Sorry, big sis.

I think she was bracing for the suprise of the door being flung open, but the vision of Mary as the Star Hegemony's universe Captain Rommie really shocks her. Unfortunately, she doesn't greet her new domme and is openly eyeballing her. Two big mistakes I know she knows better then. I sigh as I pick up a crop off the coffee table and get up to discipline her. Shock is no excuse for imupudence, she knows that.

Mary has just been death glaring her former boss, letting her dig herself deeper by the second with her silence and staring. Mary sees me stand and waves me to sit down ""Please Mistress Sandy, sit down and don't trouble yourself, I'm the one being evaluated, I'll handle this."" As I sit back down I hear her voice rise as she rips into Slave Zero. I wish I'd brought earplugs, though it would probably be a discourtesy to Mary to put them in.

""YOU LITTLE IDIOT, STOP EYEBALLING ME! THEY TOLD ME MISTRESS NORA MOLDED YOU INTO A AN AMAZING SLAVE! I DON'T SEE IT! GREET ME PROPERLY, NOW SLAVE!."" Was I glad when that stopped, phew!

I hear a meek, mmphed ""Eeeting, iswess iliamso."" Greetings, Mistress Williamson, presumably with her eyes cast down. Now Mary's voice, low and dangerous. ""Slave, for as long as I'm a domme and your Slave Zero, I never want to hear any part of my name in your filthy little mouth. Address me as simply ""Mistress"" or ""Ma'am"" from now on. Greet me again, slave, properly. I'm running low on patience.""

""Eeetings, iswess!"" with as much desperate enthusiasm as she can muster. Mary just rolls her eyes and hmmphs ""Stupid fool. She steps aside and points to the wall. ""Go face the wall, nose on the sticker."" Sheila totters past Mary, who gives her a light shove as she passes, making her stumble. But she rights herself and totters to the wall, then stops looking a little confused. ""That's right, you're going to have to hunch down a little to get your nose on the sticker. It's going to be uncomfortable, I don't care slave! Back up a step, idiot! hunch until your nose is aligned with the sticker, fool! Thats it, hold it!""

I watch an discomfitted looking Sheila slightly bent to get her nose on the sticker. Her eyes blaze with anger, making me guess the sticker is something mocking and humiliating her. 

I know I should do the polite thing and take the coffee from Mary. But I want to keep her from using the flogger on my sister. I exchange a look with Lara and she nods, wordlessly acknowledging my course of action.

""Stay there!"" Mary commands Sheila, then stalks in pushing the door shut behind her. As she turns to us and I finally get up to take the coffee from her, the mean scowl turns into a dazzling smile she favors Lara and I with. I realize one thing we have in common is we've both fucked and sucked Dave. The former Navy girl is absolutely gorgeous!

As I take the coffee from her, Lara stands up to shake her hand. She answers her smile and shows no trace of animosity despite watching the blond demean her sweetie, she's in professional Top Domme mode now.

""Wow, Lara dear, it is good to see you again, I mean it. I've heard so much about what a mover and shaker you are in our community after you came back full time. Top Domme, wow! And Constance is your Executive! I bet Sheila wishes she treated both of you better now!"" Lara bites her lip a little at the blond domme's presumptions, but says not a word about them.

Instead she says ""Good to see you doing good and moving up too, Mary. When I saw you cocooned on that Bridge set, I felt terrible for you, despite our past differences. I'm glad to see you made lemonade out of lemons and are making a comeback with QOM's crew.""

Lara sounds sincere, despite seeing the PAWG harrass her lover,  and Mary looks really touched. They stare at each other quietly a long moment, hands still clasped. ""Thank you, Lara."" this said in a low, sincere voice.

They release hands and Mary turns to me. I hold out my hand to shake and the blond grabs it and pulks me into a huge hug, making me squeal in shock.

""Sandy, girl! A lot of talk about you, too! Word is you got him so trapped in that half breed pussy he doesn't open his mouth without spitting out cute little black pubes"" She'd pushed me back at arms length, probably taking in my shocked face.

""Pardon my vulgarity, girl. Hanging around Queen Of Mean's gals does that to you. But I'm serious, story is while Lara here and Constance run the show, you pussy whip Dave and keep him out of the way.""

I kind of stammer ""Uh, gee, nice to see you again too, Mary."" Then a thought hits me. What people are saying from the outside, like QOM's crew, could be very important. We need to know just how convincing our little act is to those looking in from the outside. Another look I quickly trade with Lara. She nods knowingly. Damn, but we do have good communication.

I gently guide Mary over to the couch, sitting to her right, Lara sits to her left. We pick up our coffees and sip. Mmmm,  Amarretto, my fave! Then I look at my poor sibling suffering as she strains to hold her nose to the presumably mocking sticker. Here I am drinking coffee, relaxing on the couch, while my poor sister suffers. The thought fills me with resolve. Might as well make her suffering worthwhile and pump the blond Domme for as much information as possible.
Mary is sipping her coffee and staring at the laptop screen, smirking with pleasure at the suffering of her old boss. For just a moment, I imagine sucker punching her with a left hook to the jaw. I knocked out boys with it in high school. My rusty fighting skills are coming along, especially after sparring with Layla, and now that she's enslaved, Sarah and Lara.

I shake myself, nice fantasy, but no good right now. ""Uh, Mary?"" She reluctantly drags herself away from Sheila's delicious misery (at least to her) and looks at me questioningly.

I continue as casually as I can. ""So what are you guys saying about, uh what we're doing now?"" The blond smiles, warming to her topic.

""Well, they say after Miss Bossy Bitch got caught screwing you guys over, you really put her in her place. It's common knowledge witnessed every day on the set. We had a good laugh at Miss High and Mighty in a bitchsuit, forced to pee in front of everybody on set. When Mistress Nora would even allow her to pee!""

""The word is, you and Dave were fucking in secret within a month of you getting here. You both hid it from Boss Bitch to avoid the controlling bitch's wrath. When Nora started messing her up really bad, you ""staged"" an escape in cahoots with Dave. He follows you two and pretended to convince you to come back.""

""The deal was Sheila would get treated better, even though she was still a slave. And Dave got your hand in marriage and the promise of an heir, a noble sacrifice you'd make to allieviate your poor sister's suffering. She agreed because she still needs her check to help cover your Dad's medical bills. And if she plays along, Dave will give her a glowing letter of recommendation and deny she ever betrayed you guys, so she's still employable in the fetish community.""

I sort of nodded along, hoping I seemed convincing without explicitly endorsing the story. That was so NOT what happened. But it was pretty much what we wanted Ari to think. If one of her major partners like QOM was buying it...

""They said at first everyone was happy. Sheila was treated like a cherished houseslave by you and Dave, better than getting jacked up every day by Nora. Much as I hate Sheila, I can get that. That little bitch is savage as a domme.""

""They said at first Layla was happy as Top Domme, Lara as Chief Scriptwriter. And you were still a Junior Domme and gopher girl. But everyone knew not to cross Dave's Little Princess, or else. The story is Layla started pressing you and the other girls, being more domineering than Sheila. They said you and Nora together used some ""Pussy Persuasion"" to get Dave to greenlight a plan to takedown that Taco Bitch and lock her down next to her friend.""

""Normally we wouldn't think much of a subbie/gopher girl revolt. No offense girls, but you were Sheila's submissive, Constance, Layla's sub. And you Miss Sandy, were just seen as his little side piece, so he could at least say he got pussy from a Connor sister.""

""But you took down those smug bitches hard, and really put them in their places! If a couple of subs and a gofer girl can keep them locked down like you guys do, they deserve to stay bottoms! Plus, since your little coup, we work so much better with you girls then either of those two bitches! For most QOM dommes, your leadership is respected, even Alpha Slave Sarah is held in higher esteem than..."" She looks at the laptop screen with another smirk ""Boss Bitch and her Spic flunky.""

I try to keep my expression non-commital but affirming. Now was the time to change the subject before we had to spin too many lies that might trip us up. ""That's great, Mary...and speaking of a new regime, Slave Zero committed two egregious offenses, not greeting you immediately, and eyeballing you instead of casting her gaze down. These need to be reported to Chief Disiplinarian Of Slaves Nora immediately. Normally that would be your perogative as her domme. But since the two of you have a checkered history...Lara or I can do it.""
Sorry to throw you under the bus Sheila...but it's a good distraction.

Mary waves off my concern. ""I used to hate that kid so much. But I had time to think, and I blame Sheila and that Vasquez bitch for not supervising her better. Poor kid is a good domme, but she's going to need ""adult supervision"" for a few years yet, to reach her potential. They gave her too much responsibility, let her run loose like a spoiled brat, then coddled her when she messed up. Once again, we admire how you guys keep her in check while honing her into a good domme. And laugh that those two bitches reap the karma of their mistakes when she dommes them. What's the best way to contact her, I'll do it now if it's feasible?""

I was taken aback at how quickly she forgave Nora, the stories I heard was Nora really sadistically dommed her. ""Well, try group chat, if she's not busy she'll reply.""

Mary pulled her phone out of a trouser pocket. Lara and I followed along on our devices.

Mistress Mary: Mistress Nora, are you available? I'm sorry to bother you. But I have to let you know something within the scope of your duties.

We waited 30 seconds.

Mistress Nora: Hi, Mistress Mary! We're all so excited to have you back! Except maybe Slave Zero and Slave Border Bunny, lol. Speaking of those two little twats, how's the turnover of Slave Zero going?

Mistress Mary: Unfortunately, Mistress Nora, that's what I need to talk to you about. Slave Zero failed to greet me properly until I ordered her to. She also eyeballed me until I ordered her to cast her eyes down. I did suprise the poor little thing, but I gave her over a minute to do the right thing, she kept staring at me silently until I reprimanded her nude ass. I was told her misconduct needs to be reported to you as Chief Disciplinarian Of Slaves on the Persevearance set.

Mistress Nora: SHE WHAT!!!?? That little....I trained her better than that! 😡. Discipline her however you like, but rest assured we'll convene a Disciplinary Review Board on her. I already scheduled one for Slave Border Bunny for this afternoon, I guess Slave Zero is going up, too. Accept my apologies as Chief Disiplinarian for the slave's behavior, Mistress Mary. She knows better, and we're all going to scream at her before we decide on a sentence.

Mistress Mary: No apologies necessary, Mistress Nora, I know she's a tough nut to crack. That's why we have to be tough nut crackers😁. I do have a request, can I sit in on the Disiplinary Review Board for your slaves? Mistress Dao said it's good for my education to learn how other fetish groups do things.

Mistress Nora: Sure thing, Mistress Mary, as long as my fellow Dommes and Alpha Slave Sarah agree. Sure that won't be a problem. I'm really glad you got this opportunity, I mean it, you deserve it. After your Commisioning ceremony at QOM's compound, I'll buy you a drink in the Domme's Lounge. We'll make Zero and Border Bunny compete to fetch it. Whoever comes back without the drink gets punished! 🤣

Mistress Mary: That does sound fun, I accept Mistress Nora!🤣 Thanks for your kind words and support, I appreciate them. I look forward to working with you, again. I especially look forward to laughing with you as Zero and Border Bunny scramble to fetch that drink. Roz is going to mess with both those bitches so hard, trust me.😅

Mistress Nora: Sounds fun, I like Roz, she's so cool, except to slaves! then she's a total bitch! Zero and Border Bunny are going to get shredded by her! 🤣😂😂. See you l8ter, Mary.

Mistress Mary: L8ter Nora.

Huh. I'm suprised they're so civil, even friendly to each other after what I heard. But it makes things easier.

I did like Roz, the Domme's Lounge manager, too. But she was a total bitch to bottom slaves, though she was nice to dommes, and even Alpha Slaves, if they were appropriately respectful. I remember her and Constance laughing together at how hard she ran Constance when she was doing duty as a bottom slave in the Domme's Lounge. But Roz sincerely congratulated her on her reinstatement as a domme, and bought our drinks the whole first night we drank there to show her respect for Constance.

""Well, ladies is there anything else?"" Lara 
reviews our basic slave handling and administrative procedures with Mary nodding along. I look concerned at my big sis on the laptop screen. Her and  Layla are going to probably suffer because Mary blames them for Nora's abuse. And Dao just gets off on abusing other women sexually as well as in other ways. We have to keep them safe, and do some nice things for them when this storyline wraps. Though I'm pretty sure I'm not going to let either of them come if I accept Lara's invitation to naked twister.


Sheila's perspective

I stand staring angrily at that stupid mockery of a sticker, while admitting it's creative and well rendered. Basically it's a cartoon version of me, nude except for my arms bindered behind my back, hood masked and ballgagged. How do I know it's supposed to be me? If the pink lotus piercing at the base of my cartoon pubic thatch wasn't a dead giveaway, the writing under my caricature's bare feet, give it away. 

SLAVE ZERO=LOSER GIRL 2.0 😂🤣 

My cartoon duplicate is looking up terrified and to her right at a cartoon  giant duplicate of Mary in her Star Hegemony Captain's Uniform grinning down sadistically at her. What makes it such perfect mockery is right now it's essentially the truth. I tell myself, I had a choice this time, and did the hard right thing for the greater good. It's still so humiliating.

I hear the apartment door open and Mary yell ""Right Face!"" I pivot on the heel of my right foot and ball of my left to the right, come to attention to await her next command.

Alpha Sarah likes to form us up and march us military style when she's leading more than one slave place to place and we're not coffled together. So she and Layla taught us basic drill commands so she could form us up and move us out quickly.

I have to admit as goofy as it feels being marched as a naked slave, or at least in a fetish suit with the goodies hanging out, it beats being led on a leash or coffled with other slaves like an animal. And Sarah seems to feel pride as people admire how efficiently she moves us about without leashes, tethers or even using her crop. As much as the poor ex-Navy girl has been through, she deserves something that makes her feel good about herself. Even if it is just being a good Alpha to a group of slavegirls who include two of her former bosses.

Mary sounds bemused when she says ""Not bad, slave. I hear  Sarah's been smoothing out the rough edges on you sorry lot. Meticulous as ever when she's in charge, I'll give her that. Forward march, slave!""

As I move and Mary falls in behind me, I reflect Mary ought to know, as Sarah was her Division Officer in the Navy. Mary's largely imaginary beef with the little Korean girl was a catalyst for a lot of what's happening now, me getting more involved with them then I ever intended. I just wanted to be a writer for a fetish show, I swore I'd stay out of the personal drama, figured the worst I'd have to deal with is how much Dave liked to look at my ass.

Then I think of my lovely Lara. My healing relationship with my reformed little sister. My sweet best friend Sarah (Even if she is kind of a bitch when she dommes. but who isn't?) Layla, Constance, even Nora. I could forgive her because I know deep down she's still that sweet kid who tried to hide behind Sarah when I looked at her my first tour on set. She's worth salvaging from becoming a monster like Ari. I'm doing this for the people I love. I think of the slaves Ari's marking for snuff films. I'm also doing this for the people other people love, which I wouldn't do without this wonderful extended family to guide my heart.

Mary is deceptively calm, calling out direction, knowing I know the way to the room Queen Of Mean's minions use for the ""Bottom Slave Orientation Class"". It should be named the ""Slave Ritual Humiliation Chamber"". I should have spoke up about stuff like this, if I was going to speak up. Too late now, I had to deal with consequences of poor choices. Though maybe this was a disguised blessing allowing us to decisively defeat Ari.

People are used to seeing my bare ass nude around the set, so not much laughing and pointing anymore, just some bois, and girls ogling. The only really embarrasing thing was the number of friendly greetings, high fives and fist bumps she got from staff. She could be high and mighty as Dave's consort, but I had to admit often she was better at befriending people outside our little ""Star Circle"" on set than I was. Lesson learned.

We got buzzed past the door to QOM's spaces without event. The Junior Domme at the desk is a redhead I don't  recognize, she looks up from her phone to give me a brief appreciative ogle, then back down at it. As Mary marches me to the classroom, most of the QOM crew barely glance at us, now that the novelty of the former ""Boss Bitch"" as a naked slave has become routine.

Nothing seems off until Mary stops me at a supply closet and looks around to see if there are any witnesses. I squeal in shock around my burning ball gag as Mary shoves me into the closet and slams the door behind us. 

She wraps her left arm around my waist as she forces me against the back wall. Her right grabs my throat, not squeezing, but tight enough to be a warning.

""Sheila, sweetie. Don't do something stupid. You know I'm stronger than you, and you're tied up. You'll lose if you try to fight, badly. I know that's your first instinct, it's something I respect about you. But you're not dumb enough to fight a battle you can't win.""

I mmmph around the ballgag ""eth, Misswes aryy."" feeling the lemon and hot sauce sting as it mixes with my saliva. Her hard look melts into a big, pretty smile. Despite myself I feel a twinge of arousal. There's something hot about being under the complete control of a strong, pretty blond PAWG. Is she going to take me? Oooooh, Mistress Mary....please...

As if reading my mind, her left drifts down from my waist to squeeze my left ass cheek. My moan makes her grin wider. ""I always thought you were sexy. But you know the first time I really wanted to fuck you? When Dave coerced us to dance together in his office, and you were so submissive to my lead.""

That made sense. The dance ended when she pinned me against Dave's office wall...kind of like now...except I was dressed in workout gear. I was her superior at the time, even though her taking the lead in the dance turned me on, I commanded her to let me go, and she did. Top Domme did not submit to Alpha slave.

But now, I was Beta Slave, bound gagged and nude. and Mistress Mary was my Domme...her right hand left my throat and moved down, her left let go of my butt cheek and moved up. Her left pinned me against the wall by my bare right shoulder. Her right drifted between my legs and started expertly rubbing my girl bud. Without being told, I spread my legs wider to give her easier access. She smiled approvingly at my submission.

""Good girl."" She praises me in a breathy whisper. ""You feel it too, don't you, dear...the chemistry between us."" I should be mad at her cornering and violating me like a scene in a bad women's prison movie. But I can't deny what I'm feeling, and nod my hooded, gagged head. The beautiful PAWG's smile grew bigger.

""Remember the Fetish Con dinner? Afterwards when I asked you if I could come to your apartment for a drink? I saw in your eyes when you said you were tired, you wanted to say ""Yes"", but were afraid of complications with Dave and I....wise, but this is what you missed out on...little half breed."" I moaned as her skillful fingers wound me up while denying me relief...

Then her phone buzzes. I feel disappointment as her hand removes to retrieve it while her other arm keeps me pinned to the wall. She frowns at the screen. ""Mistress Dao is not known for her patience, even though we're ahead of schedule."" The blond mumbles. She texts a reply one handed to her mentor.

Then she looks back at me. ""You know the school desk Nora tied me to when I had to go through the Bottom Slave Orientation class a few years ago? I made sure to get the same exact one for you. I know because Daci scratched a crude drawing on it, that was supposed to be me with a huge dildo in my mouth. It's such a little detail...but I know you like attention to detail...too make our TPE so much....more...powerful...""

We share a wordless look of pure lust.  Lara is a good domme...she really meets my needs now that I'm enjoying exploring my submissive side again. But she holds back out of love. Mistress Mary has a lot of lust for me, but little love. It could get...rough. And a growing part of me is...ok with that. Maybe a little more than ok.

Mary shoves the door to the closet open, and flings me  toward it, dragging me around with her left then shoving me out. ""That'll teach you to respect your betters, slave! If not I got more for you, bitch! Move, now!"" Presumably for the benefit of a witnesses who might be around. I totter a little on my ballet boots then stabilize and obey eagerly. I know the way to the classroom, and now I feel eager to get strapped in to that desk...under the mentorship of Mistress Mary....maybe I can provoke her a little...

This thing literally happened overnight when I didn't take any supplements. I had no history of mental illness. nobody in my family has mental illness as well. I don't have any head trauma or injuries or anything like that. I didn't take any kind of supplements or anything like that at all prior to this. I don't know why this is happening. I literally don't feel any orgasm at all or sexual attraction after ejaculation.

I realize that this mental block in my head is not only prohibiting my learning but other parts of my mind as well. I am struggling with satisfaction activities, even if they are low dopamine. I struggle with meditating, and I struggle with learning and focusing better. I struggle with being in the moment. I am so messed up and this is hard to explain a lot honestly. I really feel like my situation is hard to describe but it's just some weird altered state of my mind that's been tampered with and I do things out of nowhere. I don't feel the way I would usually feel when doing these activities and it just happens out of nowhere with no single negative thoughts about these daily things.

When I am learning things on my own or meditating or something like that, I am physically doing it but it's like I can't ""feel"" it. I am meditating and I can't ""feel"" like I am meditating. I am trying to learn and study but I am not ""feeling"" like I am doing it or like the process is going on. I just slept. When I was dreaming, I feel like I am connected or something, like I haven't really slept or have a good idea of what I am experiencing. I feel weird. I couldn't discern whether I was in reality or not.

I tried to drink a cup of coffee today and then I felt some effects of being alert for some time. After 25 minutes, the effects of being alert and cognitive improvement started to waver on and off. It later became diminished to a low point that I couldn't recognize it anymore. I later drank two cups of coffee and a red bull that was 16 ounces and I don't feel the hyper effects. I was feeling it after one cup of coffee this morning and I was feeling something. Then suddenly, I felt like the effects literally decreased randomly out of nowhere and it doesn't make sense because I haven't had coffee in years! I took the red bull and still feel nothing. This is tied to my situation of feeling diminished experiences out of nowhere. I also took some recreational psychedelics (LSD) from my friend for effects but I didn't feel a damn thing even though I have done acid before and felt the full power of its effects (visuals, euphoria, etc).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your kitchen is often the heart of your home, where delicious meals are prepared and memories are made. Among the many elements that contribute to a welcoming kitchen environment, home goods kitchen mats play a critical role in enhancing both comfort and safety. These versatile mats not only add a decorative touch to your space but also serve multiple practical purposes that you may not have considered.

First and foremost, kitchen mats are designed to provide comfort underfoot. If you spend significant time cooking or cleaning, you know that standing on hard surfaces for long periods can lead to fatigue and discomfort. Kitchen mats are typically made of cushioned materials that help reduce pressure on your feet and joints. This cushioning effect can make a big difference, allowing you to enjoy your time in the kitchen without experiencing the aches and pains associated with standing for too long.

Additionally, many kitchen mats feature non-slip surfaces, which are essential for maintaining safety while you work in the kitchen. Wet floors can be hazardous, especially when you're juggling pots, pans, and ingredients. A quality kitchen mat can provide a secure footing, reducing the risk of slips and falls. Look for mats with rubber backing that firmly grip the floor, ensuring they stay in place even during the busiest cooking sessions.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-kitchen-mats  
  
Besides comfort and safety, kitchen mats also contribute to the overall aesthetics of your kitchen. They come in various colors, patterns, and designs, making it easy to find one that complements your kitchen decor. Whether you prefer modern, farmhouse, or traditional styles, there’s a kitchen mat that will perfectly fit your taste. By choosing a mat that enhances your kitchen’s design, you can elevate the ambiance of the entire space.

- **Cushioned Comfort:** The right kitchen mat provides a soft surface to stand on, reducing fatigue.
- **Safety Features:** Non-slip backing prevents accidents from spills and wet floors.
- **Aesthetic Appeal:** Available in diverse styles to enhance your kitchen's decor.
- **Easy Maintenance:** Many mats are designed to be washable or easy to wipe clean.

When shopping for home goods kitchen mats, consider your specific needs. Are you looking for extra cushioning? Choose a thicker mat with adequate support. If you have children or pets, opt for mats made from durable materials that can withstand heavy traffic and are easy to clean. For an eco-friendly option, look for mats made with sustainable materials that are safe for your family and the environment.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-kitchen-mats  
  
The placement of your kitchen mat matters, too! For optimal benefits, place mats in areas where you spend the most time. Common locations include in front of the sink, stove, and food preparation areas. Strategically placing mats in these high-traffic zones can significantly enhance your kitchen experience, making cooking and cleaning more enjoyable.

If you’re concerned about your kitchen mat slipping, it might be worth considering mats designed specifically for hard floors. Many mats are crafted with features that help them grip onto tile, hardwood, or laminate surfaces without sliding around. Some mats even come with added safety features like beveled edges to prevent tripping hazards, which is especially beneficial for families with young children or elderly individuals.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-kitchen-mats  
  
Don’t forget to consider the maintenance of your kitchen mats. Many mats are designed to be low maintenance, allowing you to easily wipe them down or toss them in the washing machine for a deeper clean. Ensuring your mats are clean not only keeps your kitchen looking tidy but also helps maintain a hygienic environment for food preparation.

Investing in home goods kitchen mats is a simple yet effective way to enhance your kitchen's comfort and safety. The benefits they provide—from reducing fatigue and preventing slips to enhancing your kitchen's aesthetic—are too important to overlook. With a wide range of options available, finding the perfect kitchen mat for your home can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience. Give your kitchen the upgrade it deserves, and enjoy the comfort and safety that quality mats can bring to your culinary space.

Choosing the Right Kitchen Mat: Materials, Styles, and Maintenance Tips
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to enhancing the comfort and style of your kitchen, a kitchen mat plays a crucial role. Knowing how to choose the right one can turn your cooking space into a haven rather than a chore zone. Here’s what you need to consider.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-kitchen-mats  
  
### Materials Matter

Kitchen mats come in various materials, each with its own benefits. Choosing the right material can affect comfort, durability, and even the look of your kitchen.

- **Rubber:** Ideal for preventing slips and providing cushioning. It’s durable and easy to clean, making it a popular choice.
- **Foam:** Known for extreme comfort, foam mats reduce fatigue while standing for long periods. They’re perfect if you spend a lot of time cooking or baking.
- **Fabric:** These mats add a cozy touch to the kitchen. While they can be more stylish, they often require more maintenance and may not offer the same slip resistance.
- **Vinyl:** Water-resistant and easy to clean, vinyl mats are great for messy kitchens. They come in various colors and patterns, allowing you to express your style.

### Style and Design

The right kitchen mat can also add a decorative element to your space. Here are some styles many homeowners find appealing:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-kitchen-mats  
  
- **Anti-Fatigue Mats:** These mats are designed specifically to alleviate the strain from standing. They come in various textures, colors, and patterns to match your kitchen décor.
- **Runner Mats:** Long and narrow, runner mats are perfect for galley kitchens or narrow spaces. They allow for easy movement between areas while adding a stylish touch.
- **Printed Mats:** Want to make a statement? Go for mats with vibrant prints or motivational quotes to bring some fun into your cooking routine.
- **Custom-shaped Mats:** These uniquely shaped mats can fit snugly around your sink, stove, or any other kitchen area, ensuring that you have comfort exactly where you need it.

### Maintenance Tips

Just like any other item in your kitchen, kitchen mats require maintenance to keep them looking good and functioning well. Here are some tips:

- **Regular Cleaning:** Most mats can be wiped down with a damp cloth. Rubber and vinyl mats usually only need a quick mop with mild soap. Foam mats can often be rinsed in water.
- **Spot Treatment:** If your mat gets stained, treat it immediately with a fabric-safe stain remover. For rubber mats, soap and water typically do the trick.
- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Be careful with what you use for cleaning. Harsh chemicals can deteriorate the mat material, affecting its longevity.
- **Check for Wear:** Regularly inspect your mats for signs of wear and tear. Replace them if you notice any cracks, holes, or fading, as these can be safety hazards.

### Choosing the Right Size

The size of your kitchen mat is an important factor to consider. If you have a larger space, you may opt for a mat that runs along the length of your counters or sinks. Smaller kitchens may benefit from compact mats tucked into specific areas, such as in front of the sink or stove. Always measure the area where you want to place the mat before purchasing to ensure a proper fit.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-kitchen-mats  
  
### Conditioning and Safety

Comfort shouldn’t replace safety. Make sure the mat you choose has non-slip backing to prevent accidents while cooking. If you have children or elderly individuals in your home, this is especially crucial.

By focusing on materials, styles, maintenance, size, and safety, you’ll find the ideal kitchen mat for your home. Remember, the right choice can enhance your kitchen's aesthetic while providing comfort and support while you cook. Happy mat shopping!

### Conclusion

Selecting the right home goods kitchen mats can significantly enhance your cooking space's comfort and safety. These mats not only provide cushioning for your feet, reducing fatigue during prolonged periods of standing, but they also help keep your kitchen cleaner and more inviting. By choosing the right material—whether it’s anti-fatigue foam, rubber, or a more decorative fabric—you can ensure durability and ease of maintenance. It's essential to consider how each type suits your lifestyle and aesthetic preferences.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-goods-kitchen-mats  
  
Additionally, the style of your kitchen mat can complement your kitchen’s décor while also offering practical benefits. From modern geometric designs to classic patterns, the right mat can tie the room together beautifully. Remember to think about how easy it is to clean and maintain your chosen mats, as this will prolong their life and keep your kitchen looking fresh.

Taking time to find the perfect home goods kitchen mats tailored to your specific needs will make a world of difference. Your kitchen will not only be a safer and more comfortable space but also one that reflects your personal style and taste. So, invest in quality kitchen mats that serve both function and form. Whether you’re whipping up a family meal or enjoying coffee and conversation, a well-chosen kitchen mat can truly elevate your daily experience in the heart of your home.

The reality is that she's been the only girl I've ever fall in love with and my first relationship. That being said, in the past before I met her, sometimes I found other girls pretty and some of them catched my interest, but it never got anywhere. Until I met her. We've been together for 5 months thus far. That's what I told her when she asked me about my 'love life', and I mentioned some girls that I once met to have a coffee. Well, a day later she texts me asking ""do I look pretty for you? Because you once said that you liked other features that I don't  have, but that girl you told me has"". I met that girl one day more than a year ago and I didn't like her, I don't even have her number anymore. I explained all that to her. After one hour or so things got calmed and she even apologized and started crying. Two days later she asked again. She kept saying I mentioned that girl for a reason (she was the one asking about my previous endevours) and that I was lying. I once again explained everything to her and after a long long conversation (2 hours) she ended up crying and apologizing again. Two days later (today) she texts me ""how long since you've seen that girl? What did you two have together?"" And again, after a long long long conversation where I've explained the same again, she ends up crying and apologizing. In the mean time, she said that I was lying and that she can't stop thinking there's something going on. She even gets upset.

This is driving me insane. I do everything for her and I just show reasons through my actions for her to trust me. The first thing I think when I wake up is her and the last thing that comes into my head when I go to bed is her. There's no one else in my life but her. I don't even go out unless it is to see her for god's sake. I need some advice to handle this, because I don't know what to do. ",0,1738457914.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

Luke was a stray hanging around the house and woods with his mom, sister, and who we assumed was his dad. Luke became my shadow whenever I was outside. Always wanting to be close even when I was using circular and table saws. He is a fearless little shit.

October 13, 2023 he was up in my truck engine and I didn’t know it. I started the engine and heard the most painful scream I have ever heard. Killed the engine and started freaking out. Jumped out and I heard him whining and screaming. Popped the hood and he was wedged between the fan shroud and blade with his head against the big center belt pulley.

I was able to get him out from the bottom by grabbing him around the hips. He was really hurt and his left leg was clearly broke. His ear was hurt as well as you can see in the pics.

Obviously we took him to the vet and they were absolutely caring and wonderful to him. Both of Luke’s left forearm bones were cleanly snapped in half. They gave me three options for his leg of cast, surgery to put in pins, or amputation. As he was only 6 to 8 weeks old, we didn’t want to put him through any surgery and opted for the cast. He healed really fast even though he was quite skilled at removing his cast. After the fourth week of going back to the vet twice a week to recast, the vet finally said you can leave it off. You would never this trooper was ever hurt beside his ear that is basically stuck up and he can’t lay it back when he is mad.

He is not a big guy but is now an indoor cat. He is still my shadow but now he has my lap, shoulder, and bed. He likes to wake me by nuzzling my face in the morning and when I nap. He follows me to the kitchen counter and keeps nuzzling me while I am trying to make coffee. He is loving to my wife, daughter, and MIL but not like he is with me.

I (24F) met Josh (30M, fake name) at work four years ago. He was a new hire, and the moment he walked in, I had a crush—tall, funny, with a relaxed aura that drew people in. But we barely spoke, maybe 4-5 times in three years, since our fields didn’t overlap and he mostly worked from home. Still, every time I saw him, I got butterflies.

At our 2023 New Year's party, we flirted all night but nothing happened. Six months later, he showed up at a happy hour, unusually chatty and flirty. It was obvious he was interested—so much so that our coworkers noticed. That night, we had our first kiss (in private), and from there, things took off. We went on dates, spent nights together, met each other’s friends, and started something.

Then, a weird moment. One dinner date we were talking about our first kiss and he casually apologized for Selena (fake name, 28F) being rude to me that night. I hadn’t noticed anything, but I’m autistic, so I sometimes miss social cues. When I asked, he explained that she was just ""super protective"" of him and at that night she had been a little rude to me. 

Over the next months, I learned that their relationship was way deeper than I tought —they went to the same high school, college, the same international postgrad program that had them stranded in Paris during covid, they lived together for a few months at that time, he even told me of when they went skinny dipping in Italy with friends.

I went to crazy town, being the ovethinker anxious self that I am, but never voiced my concerns to him. Still, he caught on that I as spiralling and reassured me: nothing romantic had ever happened, she was dating his friend, and he didn’t see her that way. Watching their interactions, I believed him. But I was so in love, so head over heels, that I ignored the way she looked at *him.*  
  
When our relationship ended in disaster six months in (a long story I won’t get into), I was shattered. I couldn’t sleep, eat, or work—I had never been so wrecked by a breakup before (and yeah, I still am and it has been three months). I kept wondering why I was so obsessed with him, and the more I reflected, the more I noticed Selena.

We were never close, but we were friendly—small talk, happy hours, polite greetings. That all stopped the moment I started dating Josh. She became distant, barely interacting with me or my friends. 

While we were together this concerned me because, of course, you want your partner's friend to like you, but he told me she was going through a rough patch and it wasn't personal, so I brushed it off.

I was blinded then, but now, I see it. She acts the way I did when I was in love with him—finding excuses to talk to him, bringing him coffee, working where she can see him. She finds excuses to mention him when he's not present, the way one would bring up their favorite interest even if it has nothing to do with the conversation, rehashes stories about their time living together, and even asked colleagues about me, though she was never one for gossip.

Now, it is all so obvious— I am a woman, call it a sixth sense if you will, but we recognize the look of love in another woman's face when we see it. 

If what he told me is true and she's been in a relationship for over 2 years with some other guy, why hide it? I understand not being a public person, but absolutely no indications that you are in a relationship? No photos, no stories, no ring, no anything?

We still work together (you can imagine the office vibes), and watching them is maddening. She adores him, but he couldn’t give less of a shit, he is so uninterested it is painful to watch. And for 10 years? She has known him for over 10 years, 10 years watching him fall in love with other people, being framed as the ""super protective friend"".

I want to reach out, to warn her, I want to save her from going down the road I did, I want to empathize with her, I *get* it—I’ve felt the addictive pull of his attention, the excuses you create in your own head to justify his actions, the pain of being at arm's length but unable to do anything about it.

But how could I? First, yeah, I might be wrong, I don't know everything and I'm obviously still shaken. Second, it is not my place, I am just an expectator of this horror show now. Third, she seems to hate me now, the last thing she'd wanna do is listen to my monologue on breadcrumbing and toxic relationships. 

What do I do? There seems to be nothing that I can do without overstepping, but I also can't shake this feeling that I am watching a boat sink and I'm doing nothing to help. ",3,1738457550.0,Truthoffmychest,1,1.0,False
1ifl7jc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifl7jc,Oracle Jet / coffee remains stuck to the shower screen,"I recently got the Breville Oracle Jet, and I’ve noticed that after pulling a (only by singe) shot, some ground coffee remains stuck to the shower screen. Is this normal, or could it be a sign of an issue?

I’ve also noticed that this seems to slow down the extraction significantly, sometimes taking nearly a minute to complete a shot. I clean the machine regularly, but it still happens. 

The device is 1 week old. The issue only occurs with a single basket. Additionally, with a double basket, grind size 36 is sufficient, resulting in a 30-second espresso shot. However, when using a single basket, the shot takes a minute—sometimes 40 seconds, sometimes 55 seconds. What could be the cause of this?

by the way, isn't a grind size of 36 on the high side for an espresso shot? I use fresh beans that are 2 weeks old.",3,1738457512.0,BrevilleCoffee,11,0.8,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while having a tea and watching Dutch videos about the past ( one of my fave past times )  .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! ) 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

I’ve always felt like I was an old soul, someone who was drawn to the quieter, deeper side of life. As I’ve gotten older the less things or people I’m around the happier I seem to be. The only downside of that is I miss simple connections. 

I crave deep connections/conversations that not many people can even handle, which is fair sometimes but others times I wonder what our skill sets would be if we didn’t have the ability to communicate through social media or messaging apps. Would it be better? Would we learn more about people? 


Don’t get me wrong I am one definitely that has failed to do so in the past talking to new people but when I do find someone I click with I want to find out ALL about them. What was it like growing up, hardest lesson(s) they’ve ever had to go through, I want to know more than just “what do you do for fun” ? 

FYI, my pet peeve is that question. Which leads me into you learning a little about me:

Reasoning behind that pet peeve as a question is that it what I do for fun can be ever changing. It can change from the friends I’m with, to the seasons. It’s such a loaded question that can be broken down into many, many more questions but we don’t take the time to do so. 

So now that you know a pet peeve here are a few other things that may or may not interest you. 

I love the outdoors, eventually one day I will live in the mountains and hopefully drank my coffee on the porch every morning as the sun rises. I enjoy hiking and camping, I’d rather cook then to ever eat out again even though I’ve had some amazing food. I dream of owning a farm, growing my food and living simple. I haven’t made the best decisions in the past but I’m learning each and every day. 

Hopefully this message finds you well and if I’ve made an impression I’d love to learn more about you! If not, I hope this post finds you well. ",1,1738457166.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Hey there, fellow Redditors,

I’m a 40 something dude looking for a woman who’s ready to tackle life’s greatest mysteries with me: Why is pizza so perfect? How do socks always disappear in the laundry? And most importantly, can you teach me to finally fold a fitted sheet without having a small existential crisis?

I’m funny (at least I think I am, but my dog agrees), easygoing, and I a make a mean cup of coffee—if that’s your thing. I’m also a pro at sarcastic banter and I’ve got an extensive collection of bad puns, so prepare for eye-rolls and “groans” on the reg.

If you can handle my dry humor, enjoy spontaneous adventures, and you don’t mind me making fun of you in the sweetest way possible, we might just be a match made in Reddit heaven. Bonus points if you can teach me how to actually use the kitchen without setting off the smoke alarm.

If you’re into all of this and also enjoy the occasional Netflix binge, send me a message! (P.S. I promise I won’t send too many emojis. Maybe just a few. 😉)

Let’s see if we can create something beautiful, or at least moderately tolerable! ✌️

It obviously a company who has taken to heart the lessons they teach you about marketing in college.

What's the difference besides the color and wild jumps in price? Shrug, can't find anything. It doesn't appear to be anything related to the shave itself as there are three types of heads Baron, Forte and Carver which affect the shave.
