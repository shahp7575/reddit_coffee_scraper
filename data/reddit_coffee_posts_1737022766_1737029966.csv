1i2nmjk,https://i.redd.it/pqznmduglcde1.jpeg,Trying to figure out how tall Shifty is.,"Slight Book of Bill spoilers
TLDR: I think he’s about 16-17cm tall.

Related to my last post on here about Shifty as I plan to make a sculpture of him that I then also plan to cast in silicone or plastisol for a squishy texture.

We can see in the image that the top half of his body seems to be the same height, if not a little bit taller than Ford’s mug, and so to try and measure this I measured the diameter of a coffee stain left on some of the missing journal pages in TBOB. I can’t be sure that it’s the same mug seen next to Shifty, but I’ll assume that it is, because my brain hurts from constantly thinking about this.

The diameter was about 6cm in length, standard American mugs have a diameter of about 8cm and are about 9.5cm tall (according to Google), so I just decided to -2cm from both of those measurements. Which means the mug is about 7.5cm tall and so this would put Shifty at about 15cm tall, based off the assumption that his real height would be around the same height as two mugs. In the image he appears slightly taller than the mug so I would guesstimate his height being around 16-17cm.

If you would like to correct my math, please do, I’m not good at it, if this post was hard to read I’m so sorry; English IS my first language, I’m just bad at it.

Also if someone has already made a sculpture like this I’d love to see it.",1,1737029819.0,gravityfalls,0,1.0,False

* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

Armed with his phone, a cup of coffee, and $500 in his trading account, Carl dove into the market with enthusiasm unmatched by experience.

One evening, after a particularly painful day of losses, Carl stumbled upon a peculiar setting on his trading platform: the ability to adjust the time zone of his charts. “Wait a minute,” Carl thought, his eyes lighting up. “If I set the chart to the future time zone, I can see what’s going to happen before it does!”

Carl switched his charts to Tokyo time, convinced he had outsmarted the global Forex market. “I’m a genius!” he whispered to himself, placing trades based on his newfound “insider” knowledge of the future. Naturally, Carl ignored the fact that price movements remained exactly the same, regardless of the time zone displayed.

In the first hour, Carl miraculously made a profit—entirely by chance. “I knew it!” he exclaimed, texting his friends about his revolutionary discovery. One even replied, “Bro, that’s how Jeff Bezos probably started.”

But as the night wore on, Carl's “future” trades began to unravel. He placed a massive bet on the GBP/USD pair, thinking he could predict a breakout based on his Tokyo chart. Instead, the market plummeted faster than his confidence. Within minutes, Carl’s account balance looked like his chances of becoming the next Forex legend: zero.

The next day, Carl sheepishly called his friend Dave, a seasoned trader, and confessed his ""time-traveling"" strategy. Dave laughed so hard he nearly choked on his coffee. ""Carl, that's not how Forex works,"" he explained between chuckles. ""You didn’t time-travel—you just changed the clock. Next time, try learning support and resistance instead of thinking you’re Doctor Who.""

Carl learned an important lesson that day: there are no shortcuts in Forex, and time zones don’t equal time machines. With Dave's advice, Carl signed up for [TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/), where he could practice proper analysis using advanced charting tools. “Wow,” Carl said, exploring the platform. “So this is what real traders use!”

I’m exploring a new way to send small amounts of money (like $5 or $10) across borders—practically as easy as sending a text. Think of it like buying a coffee for a friend who’s living abroad.

# What’s the Problem We Want to Solve?

* **High Fees:** Many traditional methods charge you $10–$40 just to send $30. That’s pretty painful if you only need to send a little.
* **Slow Processing:** Sometimes it takes days for a transaction to clear. And weekends? Forget it.
* **Frustrating Details:** Bank info, SWIFT codes—too many hoops to jump through for smaller sums.

# What We’re Proposing

* **1.** Ultra-low fees for sending tiny amounts (like $5–$50).
* **2.** Quick transfers—within minutes, regardless of weekends or banking hours.
* **3.** Extremely simple UX: possibly just a link or phone number.

*(We’re keeping the technical details under wraps for now—just imagine a faster, more affordable channel to send or receive funds.)*

# Questions for You

1. **Have you ever wanted to send or receive small amounts (under $50) across borders?**
2. **What’s your biggest pain point with current solutions (PayPal, Western Union, bank wires, etc.)?**
3. **If there was a way to send a few bucks without all the bank hassle, would you use it?**
4. Any red flags if it involves new tech (like digital wallets)? Or is cost and speed all that matters?

1i2ne7j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2ne7j,"Willpower, Curiosity and ADHD","I have a theory and i wanted to share it and get some insights from you guys. 

If we were brought up in an environment where we heard words: ""Intelligent but lazy"" ""You have to do this"" ""Just force your way through this"" etc. We may have learned that the only way forward in life is to focus our willpower on Activity. 

And its only natural for humans to want to do one thing and not want to do other things.

What makes us want do difficult things in life, natually is curiosity.

But we were not thought to seek what is curious about the activity we dont want to do, instead just push through.

So now we are in adult lifes and there is not one thing to be done at a time but dozens. Including YouTube, SocialMedia etc.

But and we are stuck in extorting our willpower to just Acticity, Activity, Activity! Push push push.

Now when we have for example, cleaning, working, and youtube available, what things give us most curiosity: YouTube.

Then when ""curiosity valley"" of youtube is satisfyed, next curious thing might be cleaning. Now when THAT curiosity valley is satisfyed then and only then activity will ""fall"" or get pushed into work.

Now that constant push will drain our mental battery of willpower very quickly. So we seek stimulants: coffee, nicotine, adderal. And it works in a way... We just make way way waaay more shot done. Productive AND non-profuctive.

But this is a viscious cycle as more and more options are available for us, so there goes more nicotine, more coffee, more adderall.

Now if we would learn to stop extorting our will power on doing ""Activity"" alltogeather, Including Thinking (Yes, our brain sees thinking as another ""useful"" activity), then we are actually inside meditative state and ""recharging our willpower battery"" (Think Yoga Nidra, NSDR, other meditations) but then what. We do the same cycle again and again. It helps but ""The ADHD effect"" continues.

What if we stopped Activity, and focus on curiosity. Not ""I have to do this!!!"" But instead ""What about this activity, even little thing can be fun. What can be interesting. What can i still not know about this that i could learn, and so on.

Now we can pull the strings of curiosity, and if we ask enough questions, the vally can be so large and vast that we will ""Naturally"" fall down with our Activity into curiosity valley we've just created.

I know its the same st dr.K talks about but maybe illustrated in a different way, I wanted to share that for anyone struggling, not knowing what to do, maybe it will help. :)

Brain science is showing that most of us cement personality traits, attachments, etc by like 7. This also seems to include the ability to regulate oneself, learn the art of discipline, and administer it to self as you grow.

Now imagine you’re a kid born into violence and by the time you’re 22 and do a text for what they now call ACEs, you calcite three times higher than where the chart tops out at, but it’s still another ten years before you consciously realize “my life is in shambles. This is by and large thanks to trauma brain, AND all it took from me.” And so you work another decade in coming out of crisis mode, sustain more traumas in getting out, sort thru your crap, heal a lot of it, and so now finally can see the habits you ought have but don’t, *and realize you don’t have any concept of how to build them*.  You also have one person in your house who for the time being is there but contributes more hinderance than support or active help, and nobody else in your daily living to be an accountability partner or coffee friend, and unfortunately it’s uncouth to go move into your therapists office even if he wills micromanage you (which mine won’t). Throw in some insomnia, situational depression, actively experiencing grief for the first time, and not enough money to buy all the treatment items you “need” to supplement sleep or stress response or etc. AND life has no pause button.

?? How do you create, force, will self discipline??? 

?? What books or podcasts or apps help you stay on track for the things you start with, so you make ie long term habits for say five things a day plus a few weekly and monthly ones, track them awhile, then add in more agenda items, without shirking the ones you’ve already built up?

Hell, my supervising attorney was not consulted on the decision to give me the axe, and was as dumbfounded as I was when I did not get that return offer, which is how I know my work product had nothing to do with it. I am generally kind, social, down to earth, and extroverted, and I bonded deeply with my summer class and many associates. Still got the boot, and I have been a mess ever since. But that's a story for another day.

The biggest reason as to why it was such a devastating development is because my grades are not competitive for firm jobs. I've never gotten anything below a B, but I am still in the bottom half of my class. So it was that firm or no firm, at least while my transcript looked the way it did as of summer 2024.

I earned straight As this past academic term, and my hope is to keep up that rhythm for the rest of law school, crafting a narrative of learning from my mistakes and implementing a revolutionary course correction.

I did have significant work experience before law school, but that isn't making a difference.

I have truly never felt this boxed in and so out of options career-wise.

A Caller Just Confessed to Murder.,"I’ve been hosting Midnight Confessions for nearly a decade now. It’s a late-night radio show where insomniacs, loners, and the occasional drunk dial in to spill their darkest secrets. Affairs, regrets, lost loves—I’ve heard it all. It’s usually just lonely voices seeking connection through the static.

But last night, something changed.

Last night, I got a call from someone who might be a killer.

It started like any other shift. I settled into my chair at KZ-93.7, sipped my lukewarm coffee, and adjusted my headphones. The studio was quiet, save for the hum of equipment and the soft crackle of the on-air signal. I took a deep breath and hit the switch.

“Good evening, night owls. This is Midnight Confessions, and I’m your host, Jess Carter. Tell me what’s keeping you up tonight.”

Calls trickled in. A trucker on a long haul. A woman confessing she still spies on her ex’s Instagram. A college kid debating dropping out. The usual. Then, at 1:13 a.m., I got his call.

A deep, measured voice. Calm. Too calm.

“Hello, Jess.”

“Hey there, caller. Got something to confess?”

A pause. Then:

“I killed someone tonight.”

I let out a short laugh, half-expecting it to be some edgy teenager messing with me. “That’s quite the confession. Care to elaborate?”

A long, static-laced silence. Then:

“She was number five.”

Something in his voice—flat, clinical—sent a ripple of unease through me.

“Number five?” I repeated, forcing my voice to stay steady. “Five what?”

He sighed, almost disappointed. “You’re not listening, Jess. Five lives. Five souls. You want details?”

I should have hung up. I should have cut to commercial, laughed it off, moved on. But the way he spoke… it felt real.

Against my better judgment, I asked, “Where did this happen?”

A soft chuckle. “You don’t need to worry about that. It’s already done.”

The air in the studio felt heavier. The usual white noise of the sound booth, the hum of the monitor, even the faint rattle of the AC—all of it seemed to fade.

I glanced at the producer’s booth. Empty. Greg had gone out for a smoke. I was alone.

I swallowed. “Why are you telling me this?”

Another chuckle, this one almost… amused. “Because I like you, Jess. I listen to you every night. Your voice helps me focus.”

A sharp chill ran through me.

“And because you understand,” he continued. “You listen to people’s pain. You get it. The things I’ve done… they make sense to you, don’t they?”

My mouth had gone dry. My pulse pounded in my ears. “No,” I said carefully. “They don’t.”

A sigh, like I’d disappointed him. “Pity.”

Then, a click. The line went dead.

I sat there, frozen, my hands gripping the desk so hard my knuckles turned white. Was it a prank? A sick joke?

I wanted to believe that. But something about his voice… the absolute calm in it… felt too real.

Greg came back from his smoke break a few minutes later, and I told him about the call. He frowned but shrugged it off. “Some psycho looking for attention. Happens more than you think.”

Maybe he was right.

But then the next night came.

And the caller came back.

1:09 a.m.

Static. Then, that same voice.

“Hello, Jess.”

I felt my stomach twist. “Back again?” I kept my tone light, casual, even as my hand trembled over the mute button.

“I like talking to you,” he said. “And I thought you’d like an update.”

I should have cut the line. Should have ended it. But I didn’t.

“Update?” I echoed.

“Number six.”

My breath caught in my throat.

“She didn’t struggle much,” he continued. “Most people do. But she just… accepted it.”

I pressed the cough button, muting my mic, and frantically waved at Greg through the booth’s glass. He glanced up from his phone, confused.

I pointed at the line, mouthing: Call the police.

The caller sighed. “You’re distracted tonight, Jess. That’s disappointing. You should be listening.”

I unmuted, forcing my voice to stay calm. “I am listening.”

“No, you’re waiting.”

My pulse hammered. “Waiting for what?”

A pause. Then, in a voice so quiet it barely rose above the static—

“For me to say your name again.”

My blood ran cold.

“Do you feel it yet?” he asked, voice almost gentle. “That little prickle at the base of your neck? The weight of my eyes on you?”

I turned, scanning the darkened studio. The glass walls. The empty hallway outside.

“I’m close, Jess.”

A soft exhale.

“I can see you.”

The lights flickered.

I shot out of my chair, my breath coming in short, shallow gasps. My back pressed against the wall as I scanned every corner of the studio.

I couldn’t see anything.

But I could feel it.

The call clicked off.

Silence.

Then—

A soft knock at the studio door.

I barely remember Greg grabbing the emergency bat from under his desk and throwing open the door. The hallway was empty.

But taped to the glass—

A single Polaroid.

A photo of me, taken from outside the studio window.

The timestamp?

1:13 a.m.

Exactly when he’d called.

The police took it seriously, at least at first. They traced the call, but it bounced through so many servers it was practically a ghost. The photo? No fingerprints.

They offered to station a car outside my apartment for a few nights, but I could tell they didn’t think it would happen again.

They were wrong.

Because now, every night at 1:13 a.m., the phone rings.

I stopped answering.

But he doesn’t stop calling.

And last night?

When I got home from the station—

There was a Polaroid waiting on my doorstep.

A photo of me.

Sleeping.

I don’t know what to do.

And I don’t know if I’ll survive long enough to find out.",2,1737027909.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1i2n4ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1i2n4ay/whats_up_with_the_bigotry/,What’s up with the bigotry? ,"Seriously, I don't get it. I've been out of Sydney for a few years because I work back and forth doing some work in U.S and Canada, and come back. A friend of mine moved here because her background is Canadian with her father being Australian, but he recently passed away, but she's also Greek descent, but most would never guess.

I swear though, just observing how people are with her, it's underlying bigotry and nose turned up, same with her sister, her sister is more olive skinned (tan), but inherently gorgeous.

Yet still deals with bigotry from old women, some being Italian, and so forth, like nitpicking her because she wasn't born here, yet they weren't either?

It's so baffling or even rich snobs making comments when she made a brief mistake at work (new to her job) then the rich snob group laughing in her face, trying to talk down to her for being from Canada, therefore ""must"" be an idiot.

Like what the fuck?

In Canada, people don't treat you like that, fuck, even in the U.S in smaller towns, you're very welcomed and both Americans and Canadians are very warm.

The fuck is up with us lately? Too much milk in the coffee making everyone gassy? And that's *coming* from an Aussie I don't remember it being this bad case of main character syndrome, what happened to the laid back vibes like in 2016?

1i2n0sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1i2n0sf/my_experience_as_a_23yo_female/,My experience as a 23yo Female’ ,"Hello everyone! I thought I’d introduce myself here since I often comment on people’s posts.

I’m a 23-year-old female, French, and currently living in France (important to mention as the medical system here is different from the U.S.). I started seriously dealing with PVCs (and possibly PACs—still waiting for my Holter results as I write this!) in August 2024.

Before that, I had only experienced a few isolated PVCs that I felt: one in 2021, two in 2022, and one in 2023. Since they were rare and didn’t happen repeatedly, I never thought much of them.

Now, my real journey with PVCs began in August 2024. Here’s the timeline:

August 3rd, 2024: I caught COVID for the second time, and it was brutal—high fever and symptoms that lasted a week.

August 24th, 2024: I moved to Orlando to fulfill my dream of working at Disney World 🐭🏰. On that day, I felt one singular PVC but brushed it off as stress (spoiler: it wasn’t just stress).

After August 24th, the PVCs started increasing. First, I felt two a day, then four, then ten, and so on.

September 8th, 2024: On my first day at Magic Kingdom, I started having what felt like hundreds of PVCs a day. At this point, I didn’t know what they were or that they were harmless. My anxiety skyrocketed because I was convinced this sensation in my chest was a prelude to a heart attack or something worse.

At the same time, I was working 12-hour shifts with only one day off per week, which I spent sleeping and cooking. I was also terrified of going to the ER because, although I had insurance, I wasn’t sure how much would be covered.

By mid-September, I was convinced I was going to die. I’d go to work and constantly check where the defibrillators were located. I avoided roller coasters and stopped drinking coffee. Finally, one day, I decided to go to the ER.

At the ER, I tried to explain the sensation: a big BOOM in my chest that felt like a “wave.” The doctors looked at me oddly and asked if I had anxiety. I told them no, but this feeling was making me anxious. They did an ECG, which showed nothing (because, of course, the PVCs always disappeared when I was with a doctor 😒). They dismissed me, said I had anxiety, and suggested yoga. I left the ER feeling completely defeated.

Over the rest of September, I went to the ER three more times, but they kept dismissing me and even made me feel ridiculed.

Finally, at the end of September, after a particularly bad night of PVCs, I booked a flight back home. I packed two suitcases, quit my dream job at Disney, and returned to France.

October 4th, 2024: I saw a cardiologist in France. He wasn’t bad, and he gave a name to what I was feeling—extrasystoles (PVCs). I was so relieved that someone was finally taking me seriously. He did an echocardiogram, which looked normal, and a 24-hour Holter monitor. However, during that 24 hours, I barely had any PVCs, so at the follow-up appointment, I told him I was still worried. By then, I had experienced my first couple of runs (triplets). He told me it was nothing and prescribed propranolol.

I took propranolol for a month, but it didn’t help my PVCs at all. I was still feeling anxious because I didn’t feel like my concerns were being taken seriously.

Eventually, my mom spoke to a friend, whose father is a cardiologist. He agreed to see me!

December 16th, 2024: This new cardiologist was AMAZING. He listened to me for 20 minutes while I explained everything I had been through. I was holding back tears because I was emotionally drained, but he was so empathetic and validating. He explained that it was normal to feel anxious about PVCs and took time to teach me about the heart, how PVCs work, and why they’re harmless in a structurally normal heart.

He ordered a two-week Holter monitor and a cardiac MRI to rule out any structural issues. He also explained treatment options, including different medications and ablation. He said the best “treatment” was acceptance—telling myself that I am safe and that PVCs won’t harm me. This advice made a huge difference in my mental state.

Since then, I’ve had my MRI (which looked normal, though I’m waiting for my cardiologist’s review), and I just finished the two-week Holter monitor. I was actually glad because, during those two weeks, I had several triplets, so at least the doctor will see them. I won’t get the results until March 3rd unless something urgent comes up in my results. 

In the meantime, I’ve been focusing on managing my anxiety. On good days, I only have a few PVCs. On bad days, when they’re constant, I remind myself that they’re harmless, that I have a great doctor, and that I’m safe. It doesn’t stop the PVCs, but it helps me deal with them.

My cardiologist encouraged me to live my life fully. I told him I’ve always dreamed of traveling to Japan, and he told me to go for it—so I booked a trip! I’m leaving for Japan in February!

I have my next cardiologist appointment on March 3rd, and I’m excited to review all my results with him (and bring him a gift from Japan!).

I hope my story gives some hope to anyone struggling with the mental toll of PVCs. My biggest advice is to find a doctor who listens and takes you seriously, especially if you’re young, as many doctors dismiss young people as “healthy.”

I’ll update this post with any new developments. Thanks for reading!",1,1737027497.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

1i2myjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPAP/comments/1i2myjt/md_appointment/,MD Appointment?,"I had my first MD appointment after 3 months of CPAP use. She was all over the place. Basically, I said I am still fatigued and on occasion still wake with a headache. On occasion driving home I am so tired i feel it would be safer to pull over. I don't think I would fall asleep, but the fatigue is heavy    
She said I wasn't sleeping long enough so hard to know if the CPAP machine was effective.  Right, I am up at 3:30 -4 regularly. I have adapted my life to this. I do often immediately start thinking in the morning, which i know doesn't help my ability to go back to sleep.  I get up have coffee, workout, and go to work. Usually in bed by 9. So now for the list of things she said. *Maybe you would do better on bipap. Can you think about those things you think about in the morning in the evening?*  I did not how to respond to this. *Are you depressed? Do you want to see a therapist to help with your busy mind.  Are you anxious?* I would not describe myself as anxious. Monkey mind, restlessness perhaps, but I have done a lot to to improve sleep hygiene. I have zero desire to see a therapist at this point.  *Incorporate meditation.* *Maybe go to bed at 10 that might help you sleep longer.*  
We circled the drain on a lot of topics and basically my take away is I need to sleep longer and I won't be fatigued. She did put in an order for an overnight study. If my insurance pays for this, I am curious about this. A friend of mine found it valuable to get more information.  I left thinking if my issue really is more about not sleeping long enough what exactly is the purpose of the machine. I have mild sleep apnea so I understand that is more difficult to treat, but perhaps a CPAP is not the answer. Anyway a bit of vent as I am thinking maybe she has a point about meditation and managing stress. The thought that popped in my head sitting with her  is I need a new job. The commute is wearing me down. Perhaps that is also contributing to my sleep issues.",1,1737027242.0,CPAP,1,1.0,False

**Caweet Case for Kobo Clara Colour/Kobo Clara BW 6 Inch 2024 Release**

https://preview.redd.it/kqasj4ue9cde1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85303c8b20a492e615000f16502effd36f9c50f7

This is the one I tend to use the most. The design is a little low resolution when viewed up close but looks fine at the distance I hold it for reading. The texture makes it non slip and is comfortable in the hand. My page turner works fine but it does have a slight lip and does not sit completely flush with the Clara. The holes are perfectly placed but the power button is fairly deep in the back. Weight is just over 100g. Sleep technology works with no issues.

**TUDIA SKN FLIP V2 Designed for Kobo Clara BW/Colour Case (2024)**

This is a little lighter than the Caweet at about 90g and allows for stickers in the back cover while still having front protection and sleep technology that has worked perfectly. You can feel the magnet snap into place while it isn't as visible as the Caweet. 

It fits the Clara BW perfectly but the lip is a bit larger around the device and I have to kind of angle my page reader to work. I appreciate that this cover folds unlike the Caweet but I would love the origami fold and cuter colours. The holes for the charger and power button are perfectly placed and the power button not as deep into the case. But I don't remember the last time I used the power button so minor I guess. If it was not just grey or beige as the options, I would probably use this more.

**Tiorecime Case for 6"" Kobo Clara Colour/Clara BW/Clara 2E eReader, Lightweight Anti-Scratch Shockproof Soft TPU Back Clear Cover**

https://preview.redd.it/3u7ip443ccde1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b8256b36f92f33ab1608a3ba9857190c1ec2581

I wanted to love this for using at home when I am less likely to have it in the sleepcover but also risk my cat knocking it off the coffee table or something. It does fit the device well but the hole for the charger is not quite lined up so any charger with a larger head doesn't push in all the way and it had some rough areas on the plastic that were rubbing against my skin so I gave up using it. I did try filing them down but you can still feel it. The corners do help if you drop it though and while it has a lip, I could use my pageturner with it and the clear back allows for stickers without sticking them to the device.

I am sure the options are different elsewhere but hope this helps anyone searching for a case for their Clara

Then I replied to her story we chatted a bit and then I asked her out for coffee, and she said yes. Though we were not able to meet up on Christmas we rescheduled to 2-3 days later. We went out had a good time over food, spoke for about  2-3 hours that day it was fun. Post that she shifted to a different city (~2 hours from my place). Since then I have been meeting her every weekend (we meet up over food and just chat for hours, like 3-4 hours, last weekend the place we went for lunch, we stayed there 4 hours, all customers left staff started prepping for dinner and we were still talking). We talk over WhatsApp and Instagram all day. Share events from our day. I feel like I am falling for her, how do I know if she is actually interested, I want to date her.

I am one day away from ordering an R1 and that will be a big change not only in device but also inventory. I was (am) used in buying several different beans in 1kg sizes because with my roaster I would split the kg in 4 roasts of 250g each (raw), spread in X months (not back to back of course). That would allow me to taste several different coffees over the year/months. With the Aillio it will partially change, meaning I'll need probably bigger bags for the single coffees (1kg being not enough room to experiment with the bean on the Aillio) and I am unsure what kind of batch size would work best, in the sense that:

\- batch size big enough to actually have a profile suitable for an even bigger batch size (say for you and a friend, or if you want to sell)

\- batch small enough to leave you room to experiment with the rest of your inventory weight but not as small as to cause a real issue.

I read the official is 350g, but then again there were people roast sampling 150g. People saying 800g and already you overheat boards...

I roast for my use and 3x or 4x 250g was my ideal roast. I had in mind of ordering from now on in 2kg batches and splitting them in 5x 400g or 4x 500g.

Any other input is welcome.

p.s. I could keep my current roaster for sample roasting but that is not really possible since it's a steel drum roaster on gas flame without any sensor so I'd rather do the batch tests on the Aillio directly.",1,1737026141.0,roasting,1,1.0,False
1i2mnx9,https://i.redd.it/spvfrzzgacde1.jpeg,My humble 6 months collection. What rabbit hole I've gotten myself into.,"Let's start from right to left. I'm fairly new to this so here are my thoughts.

Afnan 9PM : it opens up with a little blast of alcohol, little bit of fresh aquatic notes and a lot of bubble gum. It's more like centre fruit chewing gum when it used to come with jelly on top. I got it from Khanna brothers (will post seller experience later). It's a recent batch so waiting for it macerate. Projection 6.5/10, longevity 4/10. It's smells a little different than mainstream so people ask about it.

Hawas OG : gave in to the hype and ordered from Khanna brothers. It's not worth the hype imo, people may tend to like it because of the older batches but the recent ones are not like what it's described. It's more similar to Armaf Hunter, idk if it's a good thing or not. Opening is fresh but drydown is on the sweeter side. It's kind of a mass pleasure so I would say it's a safe blind buy. I'll wait for it macerate and see if anything changes. Projection 7/10 longevity 5/10. Is it a complement getter ? Haven't got yet.

Armaf Hunter: it was a gift from my uncle who is from Dubai. The opening is alcoholic blast but after 15 minutes it becomes fresh somewhat lavendery but sweet smelling which improves as time goes by. This has got me compliments from a few of my female friends and most of my male friends. Personally speaking, it elevates confidence whenever I wear it. The only caveat is, the projection fades away but the scent lingers on on clothes till next day. Projection 7.5/10, longevity 7/10

Spirito Divino Hard tobbaco : this is a niche fragrance house that mostly caters to overseas (mostly Italy). This was a gift and it's tobbaco well done. It's a beast mode fragrance, it's masculine, it's sexy and it's unique. By far the most compliments that I have received are on this one. It's a head turner. I wore it to office one day and the whole room was filled with it and it got compliments. This one has best silliage of all collection and definitely a scent for special occasions. If I could compare it with someone it would be Mancera red tobbaco but the harshness is toned down. Two sprays are enough and you can smell it on clothes the next day. Projection 10/10, longevity 10/10

Spirito Divino spicy cappuccino: my search for coffee fragrance ended here. It was a gift and it's my winter go getter. I have not smelt any fragrance like this to compare but it smells like freshly made Davidoff Rich Aroma or Espresso 57 with sugar. It has little hints of dark chocolate and vanilla. Projection :10/10, longevity: 10/10

Perlier vanilla coffee EDT: I got it from italy, it smelled better in store. It was my first fragrance and as the name suggests it's smells  like vanilla and coffee but more vanilla when it dries down. I use it in winter and since it's an EDT it vanishes away in couple of hours. Projection 4/10 longevity 3/10

Armaf craze: this perfume is not for everyone. I got it from armaf's website after reading some reviews that it smells like Ombre leather. It's very strong and headache inducing scent which smells like grandpa and leather shoes. It was a blind buy and I regret it. It's so potent that it wont got away from your skin completely even after you wash it. Drydown is somewhat bearable. Projection 8/10 longevity 8/10

Lattafa khamrah qahva: the spicy, a little sweet, cinnamony gourmamdy fragrance. You can't go wrong with this in winters. I got it from Khanna brothers. It's also headache inducing if you over spray it. Definitely for special occasions and the drydown is good. Projection 8/10, longevity 8/10.

Musk collection sledgehammer (not in pic): got this one from Dubai and this is the most blue smelling perfume I have. It smells like lemon, lavender, peppermint. It smells like lemon soda without after some time. Evaporates very quickly but it's good enough for gym, creates my own bubble. Projection 4/10, longevity 2/10

Perfume oil roll ons (I got all of them from Auroshikha store, Pondicherry)

Opium: smells like a mixture of weed and a little bit of henna. I layer it with vanilla coffee to not smell like a stoner. Definitely a unique one.

Blue: an aquatic blue smelling oil with lemongrass hints

Ocean: a typical aquatic about of shower smelling oil.",1,1737026121.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

me (19f) and my bf (20m) have been together for 9 months. we go to different universities that aren't too far from each other so we visit each other every weekend

this week, i've been with him at his uni accomodation since monday and will be going back to mine friday morning. we've been practically attached to the hip since, as usual during our weekends, but there was an issue yesterday that has him mad at me but i'm not sure if i'm in the wrong

one of my best friends goes to my bf's uni also. i don't see her very often, like once every few months, and yesterday she asked me if i wanted to meet up as she had a break between classes on campus and my bf's accommodation is right on campus

it was around 10am when she asked this and my bf was still asleep so i thought sure, what's the harm in me seeing my friend who's a 5 minute walk away for a couple hours? i left my bf's flat around 10:30 (he was still asleep but he hates being woken up so i just texted him that i was out meeting my friend for a few hours) and that was that

i saw my friend for around 3 hours, we got coffee and lunch and caught up as i hadn't seen her before christmas, and i went back to my bf's flat around 1. i had noticed before he left my message on read but didn't think much of it

when i got back he was being very off with me, and blunt with his replies. eventually i asked him what his problem was and he was mad because i was there visiting him, supposed to be hanging out with him, but i went off and saw my friend instead (he said me closing the door as i left his flat that morning woke him up) and that the plan was to make breakfast together and start watching dexter new blood, but i told him we could do that any other morning like we always do, and i had no idea when he'd wake up because he usually sleeps late

i stood my ground and said i didn't see an issue in seeing my friend i don't see much for a few hours who conveniently goes to the same uni as my bf, he had nothing to be mad about

we got into a bit of an argument but we're fine though, but i can sense my bf is a bit bitter about it. so am i AITA?

I had been planning this trip for weeks. Finn and I needed a break—a little escape from the monotony of my freelance routine. Just me, my golden retriever, and the open road. The plan was simple: drive up to Mount Hood, spend a night in a cozy cabin, and hike a few trails the next day.

Finn was already in the passenger seat, head out the window, ears flapping in the wind as we left the city behind. His joy was infectious, and I couldn’t help but grin as I sipped my coffee and hummed along to a playlist I’d thrown together that morning.

The first hour was smooth. The highway was lined with evergreen trees, their scent wafting in through the cracked windows. Finn occasionally glanced at me, as if to say, This is the best idea you’ve ever had.

We stopped at a little roadside diner for lunch. I ordered a sandwich and grabbed a bowl of water for Finn, who sprawled out on the sunny patch of grass beside our table. A waitress came over, smiling down at him.

“Beautiful dog you’ve got there,” she said, setting my plate down.

“Thanks. He’s the brains of the operation,” I replied. Finn wagged his tail as if in agreement.

Back on the road, we were less than 30 minutes from the cabin when it happened. A sharp clunk came from under the hood, followed by the unmistakable sputter of a dying engine. The car slowed to a crawl, forcing me to pull over onto the gravel shoulder.

“Seriously?” I muttered, glancing at Finn, who tilted his head in confusion.

I popped the hood, staring at the steaming engine like it might magically fix itself. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. With no cell service and the sun beginning to dip lower in the sky, I realized we were stuck.

“Alright, buddy,” I said, grabbing Finn’s leash and a small backpack of essentials. “Looks like we’re walking.”

The road was quiet, the kind of quiet that’s both peaceful and unnerving. Finn trotted beside me, tail wagging as if this was just another adventure. A mile in, we spotted a trailhead with a sign pointing toward a ranger station.

“That’s our best bet,” I said, scratching Finn’s ears.

The trail was shaded and cool, the smell of pine and damp earth filling the air. Finn was in his element, sniffing every leaf and bounding ahead before circling back to check on me. Despite the inconvenience, I couldn’t help but appreciate the beauty around us.

It was about an hour before we reached the station. The ranger, a friendly woman named Jess, offered us water and a phone to call for help.

“Car trouble?” she asked, glancing down at Finn, who was happily lapping at his bowl.

“Yeah, I think the engine’s shot,” I said.

“You’re lucky you weren’t farther out. Some of these roads don’t see much traffic,” she replied, giving Finn a pat.

After arranging for a tow truck, Jess offered to drive us to the cabin. Finn hopped into her truck without hesitation, settling in the backseat as if he owned it.

By the time we reached the cabin, the sun had set, casting the forest in a soft, dusky glow. Finn and I collapsed onto the porch, both of us tired but content.

“Well, that wasn’t the plan,” I said, laughing softly. Finn rested his head on my knee, his tail thumping against the wood.

The cabin was quiet that night, the kind of quiet that wraps around you like a blanket. I sat by the fireplace, Finn curled up at my feet, thinking about how unexpected moments like these often turned into the best stories.

We didn’t make it to the trails the next day. Instead, we spent the morning exploring the woods around the cabin and waiting for news about the car. And you know what? It didn’t matter. As long as Finn was by my side, every detour felt like the right path.

1i2mfyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i2mfyu/sustainable_furniture_choices_how_to_make/,Sustainable Furniture Choices: How to Make Eco-Friendly Decisions,"As the world becomes more environmentally conscious, the demand for sustainable furniture is on the rise. Choosing eco-friendly [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) not only helps the planet but also ensures your space is filled with high-quality, timeless pieces that reflect your commitment to a greener lifestyle. Whether you're furnishing your home with a sleek [living table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) or searching for the perfect accent chair, here’s how you can make informed, sustainable decisions.

# 1. Choose Sustainable Materials

The material of your furniture plays a significant role in its environmental impact. Opt for pieces made from renewable or recycled materials that have a lower carbon footprint.

* **Wood:** Look for furniture made from reclaimed wood or certified sustainable sources (FSC-certified).
* **Bamboo:** A rapidly renewable material, bamboo is ideal for a wide range of modern furniture.
* **Recycled Metal and Glass:** These materials can add a contemporary touch to your space, especially for items like a living table.

In **furniture Dubai** stores, you’ll find a wide array of options that cater to both style and sustainability, blending natural materials with innovative designs.

# 2. Invest in Quality Over Quantity

One of the simplest ways to adopt sustainable practices is to invest in durable, high-quality furniture. Well-crafted pieces last longer, reducing the need for replacements and minimizing waste.

**Pro Tip:** A high-quality living table with a modern aesthetic can serve as a statement piece while enduring daily use. Check out [modern furniture Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) collections for options that combine durability with timeless design.

# 3. Seek Out Eco-Friendly Finishes

Toxic finishes and adhesives can harm the environment and your indoor air quality. Look for furniture that uses:

* Low-VOC (volatile organic compound) paints or finishes.
* Water-based adhesives.
* Natural stains that enhance the furniture's aesthetic without compromising on health.

When shopping for home furniture, always check product descriptions or ask retailers about the materials and finishes used.

# 4. Buy Local to Reduce Carbon Footprint

Purchasing locally made furniture reduces the environmental impact associated with long-distance shipping. Supporting furniture Dubai retailers ensures your pieces are designed and crafted closer to home, promoting local artisans and businesses while reducing transportation emissions.

**Bonus:** Many local furniture brands in Dubai focus on combining sustainability with cutting-edge design, offering a wide range of options for both traditional and modern furniture styles.

# 5. Consider Multifunctional Furniture

Opting for multifunctional furniture not only saves space but also minimizes resource use. Look for pieces that serve dual purposes, such as:

* A **living table** with built-in storage.
* Sofa beds for guest rooms.
* Modular furniture that adapts to different spaces and needs.

Multifunctional home furniture is particularly valuable for smaller spaces, helping you maximize your interiors without compromising on style or sustainability.

# 6. Explore Secondhand and Vintage Options

Giving pre-loved furniture a new life is one of the most sustainable choices you can make. Vintage and secondhand stores often carry unique pieces that add character to your home while preventing waste.

**Where to Look:** In Dubai, explore online marketplaces or specialized vintage shops for sustainable finds that pair well with modern furniture Dubai themes.

# 7. Opt for Certified Sustainable Brands

Many furniture brands are now committed to sustainability, using eco-friendly materials, ethical labor practices, and responsible production methods. Look for certifications like:

* FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)
* GREENGUARD
* Cradle to Cradle

These certifications ensure your home furniture is not only stylish but also environmentally responsible.

**Why Choose Modern Furniture in Dubai?**

Dubai is at the forefront of merging style with sustainability. The city’s thriving furniture scene offers a wide variety of options, from eco-friendly living tables to customizable sofas and modular designs. Many modern furniture Dubai retailers focus on innovative designs that cater to eco-conscious consumers without compromising on luxury and aesthetics.

**Final Thoughts**

Making sustainable furniture choices is a powerful way to contribute to a healthier planet while creating a stylish and functional home. Whether you’re drawn to sleek living tables, timeless vintage finds, or contemporary home furniture designs, there’s no shortage of options in [furniture Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) stores.

By prioritizing quality, sustainable materials, and eco-friendly practices, you can make decisions that align with both your style and environmental values. Ready to transform your home? Start exploring sustainable options today!",1,1737025205.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

I'm a 37-year-old Finn who lived in England for over eight years before returning to Finland a couple of years ago. My married with a child so I'm not looking for anything else than kindred spirits and blossoming friendships.

I've been penpalling since I was 11-12 years old and in spite of some breaks that I've taken over the years, I've never really lost my love for the written word. I've always been shy and very much an introvert (maybe highly sensitive as well even if never officially diagnosed?) which is why getting to know new people ""in real life"" can be challenging for me. I guess that's why writing has always been my preferred medium of communication and in fairness, I do express myself better in writing 💜 That's why I'm not searching for people who send one A6 sheet and goodies every two weeks. Quite the opposite. Although, I don't solely stare at the number of pages written, I do expect to receive letters that require more than five minutes of my time to read. Furthermore, I cannot guarantee replies in a certain time frame. I most certainly don't (can't) write back ""straight away"".

Reading is another dear hobby of mine: I mainly read chick lit and crime novels but I'm happy to try other genres as well should the plot be compelling enough. If I could, I'd spend all my money on stationery and new books: if only I could buy a house big enough for a 'Beauty and the Beast' style library... Sigh.

In addition, I like, for example, travelling and visiting new places (Japan 💜 I'm currently studying Japanese by myself), rock and heavy metal music, owls, history, being by the sea, drinking too much coffee (I am Finnish after all), postcards with quotes on them, journalling, Moomins, Downton Abbey, Christmas and everything that goes with it... Just to name but a few things ☺️ 

Hopefully someone, a kindred spirit perhaps, would find me and my introduction interesting enough to want to become (pen) friends ☺️",3,1737025084.0,penpalsover30,1,1.0,False

At the beginning it was really romatic, a lot of sex, affection, he was saying I am his dream girl, he was dreaming about relationship like that, he wanted to live together, he was driving questions about future it. When we started live together it was nice and he was very happy, he was like his big dream came true. The problem appeared when a few night in a row he did not want to have sex with me because he mentioned he was tired. I asked him if it is because of masturbation and he said yes… and I started to be very anxious because during that he was watching other girls in tights etc. So from that moment I started to be anxious and looking for a signs that he doesn’t like me… I told him how I feel and he was surprised. He said that he will wait for me not masturbating. I have high sex drive and I know that in the past he had a few FWBs, and he told me that his sex drive is high. I had no problem with that. But when I was initiating sex after topic with masturbation he was rejecting me and he didn’t start sex… I was receiving it as not interest in me anymore and started to feel More anxious. After a few tries he told me That now he feel pressure, and his sex drive is lower, I took it personally because I felt that he was still masturbating when I was at work. He loves cuddling, he loved me, he kissed me a lot but… sex. Maybe I started to be More desperate and he feel that got power ower me, i don’t know. From this time I started to be frustrated with EVERYTHING. It turned out he is bad at communication due to his trauma, he prefers to be silent when I am hurt. I started to be frustrated with our 50/50 Buffet when he earn a lot more. I started to be frustrated that he does not start topics about our future. I am frustrated that he plays video games till morning. I am frustrated that he doesnt initiaties dates. That he eats fast foods. That he do not move and is always tired. That he feels pressure that I want to talk about those topics. I feel that I was his dream girl till the moment when I started to feel anxious about this relationship and told him I was not expecting that. Maybe it hurt him somehow but now I am sooo so anxious. I want a lot of confirmations and look for signs that he cares or not. I started therapy. He needs therapy too, but when I bring up this topic he is angry and quiet. I am so tired of that… now he is buying a flat and I asked him if he considered mortadeli with me, and he said that maybe, but he would like to have something that only he owns. And it also made me feel sad, but from the other side I understand his perspective. We had a bad time 2 month ago when he was playing video games instead going to bed with me, i was sad, crying and told him i have enough to feel like that. And he texted a flirty message to other girl :( I moved to my sister place after that, I forgave him after one week of silence, he promised to go to therapy, he wanted me to forgive him, he promised he will work on his communication issues, he will work on his games addiction (he claims it is not addiction but it is). And after that time he still did not take steps. And now I want more and more need to be confirmed about love and that he cares. But he feels pressure that I need that now. 
I don’t know how to feel. I feel like I sabotage everything in that relationship now because something was missing so I am looking for signs. Maybe he takes me for granted… besides that he is very lovely person, he likes to cook when I ask, he makes me coffee, cuddles me, kisses me, he takes care of cars etc. 
I want to give a chance to that relationship but it is difficult for me, I suppose we both got problems. However I want to work on myself and he doesn’t want talk about things and when I start talks he feels like I am attacking him but I do it with a big care, no offenses. 
What to do? Has anyone been in that situation when was needing a lot of confirmations? I want to live my life again. Maybe when I stop initiating everything he will see that something is missing ",1,1737024674.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

So just needing to vent and get this off my chest! I have a beautiful 8-month-old baby who I absolutely adore. My partner, on the other hand, has a 14-year-old dog that he’s had long before we met. I get it—he loves the dog and has been with him for years, but it’s getting so frustrating because the dog is seriously limiting what we can do as a family.

We can’t even go to the grocery store together because the dog can’t be left alone. If we do, he freaks out—barking, destroying things, and even going to the bathroom in the house. We live in a unit with a shared backyard, no fence, so leaving him outside isn’t an option either. He also wasn’t desexed, so other dogs either intimidate him or he intimidates them. He’s a big dog, and if another dog comes too close, it could get ugly fast. This means parks, beaches, or any dog-friendly places are out of the question. If I want to take our baby somewhere, I have to do it alone.

Our “family time” is basically limited to walking him around the block at his pace—he’s old, stubborn, and stops every 30 seconds to sniff something. It’s like pulling teeth to get through it. And don’t get me started on bath time. He hates water, so he only gets bathed every few months. The smell is unbearable, and he sheds like crazy. I’m vacuuming the house constantly, but the hair is everywhere, and it makes the vacuum stink too.

I’m just feeling trapped. I want to enjoy family time, take our baby out for a coffee date, or go to the beach together—just do something normal without everything revolving around the dog.

**Me**: Adult male, natural habitat Europe, travel style solo.

**Sri Lanka**: A destination you should very much consider visiting if the opportunity arises. A very interesting and entertaining mix of cultural heritage, nature and beach life, and very agreeable climate (in December anyway). I had great fun in SL and recommend it to anyone, especially if you are sitting in a grey winter somewhere. Everyone is friendly, people say hello in the street, wave and smile, very polite. Younger people are especially very interested in various things, at one point I had to explain what the point of decorating a Christmas tree is :)

**Safety**: I never had safety issues, neither personal, nor property. I made normal precautions and payed attention to my stuff but no issues at all. I had the general impression that it would be similarly safe for women, I saw no inappropriate behavior or hassling of women at all, and heard none of the horror stories coming out of India for example.

Dogs are not dangerous, just ignore them.

**Visa**: If you get an e-visa, print the confirmation email, it will be needed on arrival. USD52.

**Language**: English is fine everywhere. Most people will not speak much but necessities can be sorted out.

**My itinerary** (including travel days): Arrival in Colombo, directly travel to Habarana and use it as the base to visit Sigiriya, Dambulla, Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura/Mihintale (4 days), then 2 days Kandy, 3 days Ella, 1 day Tissamaharama (Yala National Park), and finally 6 days in Mirissa. I did not spend time in Colombo (your time, if limited, is better spent elsewhere), and passed on more serious hiking destinations. I planned to visit Udawalawe National Park but ended up skipping it, considering both the cost and the fact that I saw so much wildlife by then that a few more elephants seemed unnecessary :)

**Money**: Flight from Europe was quite reasonable at the time of purchase, the SL government is pushing tourism after the economic meltdown a couple of years ago and operates direct flights from several airports. Accommodation is fairly cheap, I used guest houses all the way. There are of course higher end places in more frequented areas, and a beachfront hotel will cost more than a room in some village up north, no surprise there. Note that if you book guest houses online, payment will be always at the establishment, cash, with rate calculated on the spot, meaning it will be marginally higher than what you were told originally. Local transportation is cheap. PickUp cars between cities will cost around EUR40-60, not necessarily high for the distance but adds up if you do a big round trip. Entrance ticket prices for the historical sites are insane, USD30-40 each, I spent cca. USD100 in the Sigiriya area in 3 days. Tourist rates are openly higher by multiples than for locals, accept it and move on. Restaurants are significantly more expensive than what I expected, easily lower European price levels, main+drink EUR15 in an average tourist feeder, more in nicer restaurants. 

Transactions are mostly cash, always local currency, except for nicer places that take cards. ATMs are everywhere but BE AWARE that some will not dispense cash while charging your card, so test the ATM with a small withdrawal first, and check online if people are complaining about a particular location.

All in all, SL is more expensive than I expected, budget well.

**Travel**: I used PickUp between cities, you will need a local SIM to activate it, and drivers always call to confirm the ride (eSIM with 20Gb data was cca. 5USD at the airport). For longer rides drivers may offer that you cancel the ride in the app and they will take you privately, this of course opens up opportunity to haggle a bit. In my experience though, the cheapest way to get longer rides is to discuss with your hosts, some offers I got were 30-40% under the app prices.

If you consider driving, don't, unless you are from somewhere where you got used to narrow winding roads with people walking into traffic randomly, hundreds of dogs sleeping and generally living on the asphalt, and traffic rules that are loosely based on the size of vehicle and Mad Max movies.

**Food, booze**: Food in SL is OK but ultimately bland. Restaurants cater for tourists (I doubt most locals, especially outside Colombo can afford these), the average menu mainly offers badly made western food and a few local staples like kottu. Selection in beach destinations is better, I found that the best choice is to seek out the few restaurants that specialize on something else, e.g. in Mirissa there is a good Chinese and an all you can eat curry place I really liked.

Fruit is fantastic, I could have lived on mango and papaya only, do not miss it. Alcohol is available in restaurants, not in shops. Local Lion beer is OK, some import beers are occasionally available. Cocktails are sold everywhere, mainly mixed with booze I did not recognize (and therefore try), the highlight of these is the fruit anyway, better to just buy a smoothie. Coffee is mainly unavailable outside tourist areas, even there it is often Nescafe. Tea is excellent, welcome to Ceylon.

Side note, I saw the grand total of 1 female wait staff in any establishment, all employees are always young males, with an older guy running the show. A sign of traditional gender roles I guess.

**Wildlife, nature**: Absolute highlight for me. Especially in the central part, you see so much wildlife, it is genuinely amazing. Before even visiting Yala, I saw 6-8 wild elephants, monkeys by the hundreds, lizards, buffalos, not to mention bird life (highways have warning signs for wild peacocks, that was a first). In Yala there are leopards and bears on top, along with the crazy fun safari experience. Whale watching in Mirissa is also great, we even saw a couple of mating sea turtles, described by the embarrassed guide as 'celebrating their love'. If you are interested in sea life on plates, beach restaurants offer the daily catch in the evenings, mainly varieties of sea bass, squids and crabs.

**Some opinions/advice:**

* Anywhere you book accommodation, make sure it is not right on some main road, the smog is terrible in some places.
* Habarana is a good location as a base if you want to visit more than Sigiriya in the area. Habarana itself is barely more than a crossroads but good for transport.
* If you have to choose between Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura, go with the latter and add Mihintale. Overall these will provide a richer experience, you will see both historical sites and active places of worship, and Mihintale is beautiful. Hiring a guide in Sigiriya seemed completely pointless, in Pollonaruwa it may make more sense. You can save both if you are willing to read 20 minutes of Wikipedia articles.
* Kandy does not warrant more than one day, you may even skip it. Dirty, uninteresting, insane smog, nicer stuff to see and do elsewhere. I especially disliked the beggars using animals, some revolting stuff to see.
* Tracks around Ella are in fact short and easy, not medium level as often portrayed in descriptions. If you want real hiking, you will need to look further than these.
* Book safaris ahead through your accommodation, all other transport and programs are easier and often cheaper to organize on the ground.
* Wifi/phone reception is not an issue, get a local SIM, it is cheap and practical.

But tomorrow comes, and somehow, the mess feels bigger, and your motivation feels smaller. What happened? You’ve fallen into the Mariana Illusion.

This illusion is the false belief that delaying a task won’t have consequences—or that it’ll magically be easier later. It’s procrastination’s sneakiest trick: a comforting mirage that soothes you now but leaves you more stressed later.

Why Procrastination Happens

At its core, the Mariana Illusion is fueled by temporal discounting—our tendency to prioritize short-term comfort over long-term rewards. Tasks feel overwhelming now, so we promise ourselves that “tomorrow” will be different. But by postponing, tasks grow larger, deadlines loom closer, and the emotional weight piles on.

How to Escape the Trap
	1.	Acknowledge the Illusion
Tomorrow isn’t a magical land of boundless motivation. Future-you is just as human as present-you.
	2.	Break Tasks into Smaller Pieces
Big tasks are intimidating. Start with small steps like “tidy the coffee table” to build momentum.
	3.	Use Timeboxing
Set a timer for just 10 minutes to work on the task. Starting is often the hardest part.
	4.	Consider the Consequences
Think about how delaying adds to your stress. Contrast that with how great you’ll feel when it’s done.
	5.	Reward Your Efforts
Celebrate progress with small rewards—whether it’s a break, a snack, or guilt-free relaxation.

Don’t Let Procrastination Win

1i2m4el,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i2m4el/how_to_choose_ecofriendly_and_sustainable/,How to Choose Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Furniture for Your Home,"As the world embraces a greener future, incorporating eco-friendly and sustainable furniture into your home is a meaningful step toward a more environmentally conscious lifestyle. Choosing furniture made from sustainable materials not only reduces your carbon footprint but also ensures that your home is stylish, functional, and built to last. Here's a guide to selecting eco-friendly furniture that aligns with your values and aesthetic.

# 1. Prioritize Sustainable Materials

The materials used in furniture play a crucial role in its sustainability. Opt for materials that are renewable, biodegradable, or recycled. Here are some excellent options:

* **Rattan:** A renewable resource that grows quickly and is incredibly versatile. A [rattan bench](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/positano-rattan-seater) adds a natural, earthy vibe to entryways or living spaces, while a [rattan side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/side-tables) offers a lightweight and chic addition to any room.
* **Recycled Metal:** Ideal for modern furniture designs. A [metal coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) or a [modern metal coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/leo-metal-coffee-table) crafted from recycled materials adds sleek sophistication while minimizing environmental impact.
* **Certified Wood:** Look for furniture made from FSC-certified wood to ensure it’s sourced responsibly.

# 2. Opt for Timeless, Durable Designs

Sustainable furniture should not only be eco-friendly but also long-lasting. Durable pieces reduce the need for frequent replacements, helping to minimize waste. Choose timeless designs that can adapt to changing trends and home aesthetics.

**Ideas to Consider:**

* A modern metal coffee table with clean lines fits seamlessly into both contemporary and industrial-inspired homes.
* A **rattan bench** with intricate craftsmanship doubles as seating and a decorative accent, ensuring versatility for years to come.

# 3. Choose Non-Toxic Finishes and Upholstery

Eco-friendly furniture extends beyond its materials to include non-toxic finishes and fabrics. Avoid pieces with VOC-laden paints or chemical-heavy varnishes. Instead, select furniture with:

* Water-based finishes
* Natural dyes
* Organic upholstery fabrics like cotton, linen, or wool

# 4. Support Ethical Craftsmanship

Handcrafted furniture not only reflects skilled artisanship but often has a lower environmental impact compared to mass-produced alternatives. Look for brands and retailers that collaborate with local artisans to create unique, high-quality pieces.

**Eco-Friendly Highlights:**

* Handwoven rattan side tables bring artisanal charm to living spaces.
* A custom metal coffee table made by local craftspeople can provide a unique focal point in your home.

# 5. Look for Multi-Functional Pieces

Multi-functional furniture is a sustainable choice as it reduces the number of items needed in your home. Examples include:

* A rattan bench with storage space for shoes or blankets.
* A modern metal coffee table with built-in shelving for books or decor.

These pieces maximize functionality without compromising on style, making them a practical and eco-conscious choice.

# 6. Buy Local or Vintage

Local and vintage furniture significantly reduces the carbon emissions associated with shipping. Vintage furniture also gives new life to old pieces, preventing them from ending up in landfills.

**Pro Tip:** Pair a vintage metal coffee table with a contemporary rattan side table for a unique blend of old and new.

# 7. Check for Sustainability Certifications

When shopping for sustainable furniture, look for certifications that guarantee eco-friendly practices, such as:

* FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) for responsibly sourced wood
* Greenguard for low-emission furniture
* Fair Trade for ethically produced items

**Eco-Friendly Furniture Ideas for Your Home**

Here’s how you can incorporate sustainable furniture into your spaces:

* **Living Room:** Create a stylish focal point with a modern metal coffee table, and pair it with a rattan side table to add warmth and texture.
* **Bedroom:** A rattan bench at the foot of the bed offers both functionality and a natural, cozy aesthetic.
* **Patio or Garden:** Opt for weather-resistant rattan furniture for outdoor seating that’s sustainable and chic.

**Why Sustainable Furniture Matters**

By choosing eco-friendly furniture, you’re not only investing in high-quality pieces but also contributing to a healthier planet. Sustainable choices help conserve natural resources, reduce waste, and promote ethical practices in the furniture industry.

**Final Thoughts**

Creating a sustainable home starts with thoughtful decisions about the furniture you bring into it. Whether it’s a beautifully crafted rattan bench, a functional rattan side table, or a sleek modern metal coffee table, sustainable furniture allows you to design a home that is as stylish as it is responsible.

I met her again on the 11th and things escalated. I was honest with her, about me being a virgin and also someone who doesn't have a lot of relationship experience. Maybe she would have stopped things right there if my looks weren't okay and I didn't take care of my body. Just before I was about to leave she asked if she could kiss me. And yeah, things escalated from there. I didn't get to come from intercourse because I had already come from oral sex. Honestly it might have been a lack attraction that made it hard once I had come. I found out that pleasuring someone was a lot more satisfying than being pleasured. She felt that I was a natural at fingering. Also, I think your partner matters way more than I thought it would.

We broke things off yesterday, she asked if I could see myself in a serious relationship with her, and I was honest with her. There still wasn't an attraction enough to see myself with her, and I didn't want to waste her time. We ended things on a good note.

Some things that helped me was being in good shape. I'm not Will Tennyson, but I am lean and I think you can tell that I work out. And that is something you CAN change. But I think my looks were never what prevented me. It was more my psyche and self-esteem issues.

Buying my first property, in Sydney. Had the handover inspection today and the state of the property was a complete mess. 

1. Numerous dog faeces located in front and back yard of the property. Also numerous holes dug around the backyard. Grass is almost a foot or taller around most of the backyard 

2. Rubbish left in front and back yard of the property - cotton-wool like substance scattered across the yard, pieces of plastic junk and rubbish, dirty socks, tennis balls, empty plastic containers. 

3. Large cutout hole in the ceiling of the garage (not noted during prior inspections due to the garage being so full of stuff we were not able to enter it further than two steps in)

4. Carpet has evidently not been steam cleaned and smells of dog urine. Numerous permanent urine stains in the carpet on the second floor (previous owner had 2 dogs)

5. Water leaking through the rightside window in the upstairs living room/rumpus 

6. Three seperate occasions of TV brackets removed and dry wall patched to a unacceptable standard 

7. Garage floor has been left dirty with dirt, plant material, nails, screws, coffee cups and other plastic waste. 

8. Hole in dry wall near garage backyard exit door (not noted during prior inspections due to the garage being so full of stuff we were not able to enter it further than two steps in)

9. The state of the paint in multiple points around the house have been left damaged, unclean, or both 

10. Broken tiles in the master ensuite 

11. Broken tiles in the upstairs bathroom 

12. Broken shutters on blinds

13. Vegetation growing inside of the exterior rain water tank 

14. Three unexplained holes in the front exterior of the house 

15. Missing smoke alarm on ground floor of the house, near front entry and kitchen, clearly removed by previous owners

  
Now I understand reasonable wear and tear is accepted and some of the mentioned issues may fall into this, but some of these issues I believe are beyond wear and tear. When we did the open house inspection there was some faeces and mess in the backyard, as you would expect from a household with two dogs, but assured by the agent that all of that would be cleaned up, and I guess from inexperience I didnt think to get that down in writing, as you would assume someone moving out of a house would at the minimum pick up their 2x dogs shit. Is it considered sold as is to leave the house in this state? Because the state of the backyard is definitely worse than what it was on inspection. 

Settlement is supposed to be tomorrow, agent and conveyancer have advised to proceed with settlement but to withhold cash out of the final payment pending the rectification of the above stated issues. 

I am trying to understand what my best options are, and how to best proceed. Any input or advice will be appreciated.

1i2m2g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1i2m2g6/feminists_how_do_you_deal_with_good_people_who/,"Feminists, how do you deal with ""good people"" who don't share your values?","First I apologize because English is not my native language and I am not used to posting on Reddit.

So, my question is about cases where you are confronted with ""good people"", but who do not share feminist value system at all. In my case it is my husband (of 16 years: we are both in our late thirties). To be clear, I love my husband, and I am not posting this so that he will be attacked: I am counting on you not to do it! However, I am very often disturbed, because I realize that even if we almost always share the same opinions on what is appropriate behavior, it is not at all based on the same values.

My husband checks most of the boxes of what I expect from a feminist man: he is even more involved in housework than I am (I do my best, but he is ruthlessly efficient), is an excellent father, and is the most upright person I know, to the point that it is sometimes a joke among our friends. In the time I have known him, I have seen him leave in the middle of the night after a call from a friend who is depressed, intervene when sexist behavior occurs in front of him when we were both students (but I will come back to that), take long detours in his car to reimburse a friend for coffee, etc. Also, I have never heard him make a sexist remark; nor seen him behave inappropriately. Politically speaking, he has always voted Democrat (we live in the US), although he once told me that no political party really suits him.

Those are the good points. Except that in terms of remarks, I have never actually heard him criticize anyone, including the worst people, even when we are talking to each other. I said that he intervenes when there is sexist behavior: he always does it by physically placing himself in front of the aggressor (he is physically imposing) and by trying to diffuse the tension, but I have never seen him directly confront the person for their behavior. At the beginning of our relationship, I thought it was a form of shyness or restriction. But I have since realized that he only wants to have an opinion about himself. Concretely, he is very demanding of himself and completely lax with the rest of the world, except perhaps with our daughter. Almost all of his hobbies are geared towards self-improvement (he does a lot of sports and is passionate about drawing). It's not even a form of intellectual apathy: he reads a lot of very dated philosophy for example (a lot of classic books on stoicism and utilitarianism in particular). But apart from that and the newspaper (NYT), he makes a lot of effort to disinterest himself in the opinion of almost everyone. Needless to say, he does not claim to belong to any political or societal movement. He once told me that he thinks that any society is just the combination of two natural laws: unity is strength and the strongest imposes its law, and that the dominant ideology, whatever it may be, only serves the interests of those dominating society, and therefore has no real value in his eyes. He spends as little time as possible on the net, never watches television, avoids social networks and any form of intellectual debate or judgment towards others. And when I say others, that includes me. 

When I confronted him about it, he simply answered me that he loves me more than anything but that he has no interest in influencing my opinions and that there is little chance that I can influence his. It bothers me a lot because I would like to share my values ​​with him, especially progressive and feminist ones. He on the other hand seems ok with that (he is strangely naive in terms of love which he sees as something transcending differences). I have trouble understanding his values, but I think he has a kind of ideal where everyone is only responsible for their own actions. He once told me that for him the only valid judgment towards a third person is whether they are dangerous or beneficial and that for him a serial killer or a Nazi is no different from a virus or a rabid beast and that they must be eliminated without trying to judge them because it is up to them to decide if they can look at themselves in a mirror without being ashamed. 

As a feminist, I do not agree with that. Systemic problems like patriarchy or systemic racism cannot be fought if everyone only cares about their own behavior. Also, even though he doesn't really try to influence her, I feel like our daughter is increasingly trying to imitate him on the individualistic and self-centered side, except that she doesn't hold back from criticizing others. The other day she openly criticized the time I spent reading feminist content online, telling me that if feminism itself is ok, spending time online reading debates is ""pathetic and pointless"" and that I would be better off focusing on myself. Even my husband was shocked and told her that she should apply this logic to herself and not interfere in what I spend my time on. (I don't know why, but his reaction bothered me too).

Sorry, I realize that my message is too long and that this space is not made for you to give me your opinions on my personal case... I would simply like to know if you have ever been confronted with people with whom it is difficult to apply feminist vs. anti-feminist logic because they have a value system too alien to these notions. Do you simply avoid interacting with these people (not an option for my husband and I), cohabit by avoiding debates of ideas, or have you ever tried (and with what results?) to convince them to share at least part of your ideas?",8,1737023560.0,Feminism,3,0.91,False
1i2m2au,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1i2m2au/the_mariana_illusion_how_procrastination_tricks/,The Mariana Illusion: How Procrastination Tricks You Into Thinking Tomorrow Is Easier,"
You’re sitting on your couch, staring at the cluttered living room. “I’ll clean it tomorrow,” you think, feeling a wave of relief. But tomorrow comes, and somehow, the mess feels bigger, and your motivation feels smaller. What happened? You’ve fallen into the Mariana Illusion.

This illusion is the false belief that delaying a task won’t have consequences—or that it’ll magically be easier later. It’s procrastination’s sneakiest trick: a comforting mirage that soothes you now but leaves you more stressed later.

Why Procrastination Happens

At its core, the Mariana Illusion is fueled by temporal discounting—our tendency to prioritize short-term comfort over long-term rewards. Tasks feel overwhelming now, so we promise ourselves that “tomorrow” will be different. But by postponing, tasks grow larger, deadlines loom closer, and the emotional weight piles on.

How to Escape the Trap
	1.	Acknowledge the Illusion
Tomorrow isn’t a magical land of boundless motivation. Future-you is just as human as present-you.
	2.	Break Tasks into Smaller Pieces
Big tasks are intimidating. Start with small steps like “tidy the coffee table” to build momentum.
	3.	Use Timeboxing
Set a timer for just 10 minutes to work on the task. Starting is often the hardest part.
	4.	Consider the Consequences
Think about how delaying adds to your stress. Contrast that with how great you’ll feel when it’s done.
	5.	Reward Your Efforts
Celebrate progress with small rewards—whether it’s a break, a snack, or guilt-free relaxation.

Don’t Let Procrastination Win

The Mariana Illusion is a subtle trap, but you can escape it by taking action today. The next time you hear yourself say, “I’ll do it tomorrow,” pause and ask, “Will it really be easier then?” Future-you will thank you for starting now.",2,1737023542.0,mentalhealth,2,1.0,False

Police were called over a misunderstanding, and I was asked to leave a business I was keeping warm in.

I started to leave and was like no, it's too cold, I'm not staying out there!

A cop asked me about what was going on and confirmed my car had been stolen and some other details.

He bought me a motel room!

I asked the front desk guy if a coworker maybe had any non menthol cigarettes after he gave me a menthol one. 

He gave me $7 to go buy a pack!

I was already excited about warmth and a hot shower, and now this. 

I went across the street and I don't remember why? Maybe I shared my delight with someone and was overheard.

When I got to the counter, the clerk said here, someone gave you $5.

No fucking way. I already had snacks, so this would buy a beer with leftover.

I go to the cooler to find my brand of pints on sale, I can buy TWO!

Now I'm absolutely in heaven. My own pack of cigs so I'm not stressing over that. TWO beers to completely relax, take the edge off my panic, the wall heater pumping, the shower going, adding steam to the room. Luckily I had clean clothes and a phone charger in my bag.

I ate a little and drank one of the beers while getting toasty warm.

Plugged in my phone, enjoying just sitting, feeling safe.

I set up the coffee machine for the next morning, pouring sugar packets into cups :-)

It was brilliant.

I’m having an issue with my Lelit Anna that I could really use some advice on.

Today, while making coffee as usual, the water tank ran out (this happens from time to time). I immediately refilled it, but after that, the pressure at the group head dropped to 3 bars instead of the usual 8. I also noticed that when the group head isn’t attached, barely any water comes out.

Interestingly, the steam wand is working perfectly fine, and the pump does seem to be drawing water from the tank, but there’s hardly any water coming out on the other side.

I’m wondering if the pump might have been damaged due to running dry briefly. Is this possible? I’ve already ordered a replacement pump just in case, but I’d like to double-check before going ahead with the replacement.

Also, is the pump linked below a suitable replacement for the Lelit Anna PL41EM?

The problem is that I calibrated the machine so it makes absolutely no clicking noise on its lowest setting, but for some reason after some grinding it makes noise again on the lowest settings. I went through it twice already, both times everything is fine right after calibration, but after one or two grinds it's making noise again.

I'm worried that it could damage the machine and also worried about the fact that the machine does not keep my calibration. Why can this happen? May I be doing or understanding something wrong?",1,1737022936.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

Hey community.

I have problem with dailing in light roasts without getting channeling.
Basically my workflow is like this, i measure 18-19g of coffee, i grind it in Eureka Specialita in Blind Shaker, than i transfer it to my IMS basket, use Umikot WDT with 20 turns, Distribution tool and Normcore Tamp. I flow profile it, with long preinfusion 1.5-2g/s flow until first drop than 7g/s and than full and gradually to closed flow.

Basically as soon as i increase to 7g/s it gets uneaven and messy extraction.
End result is pretty tasty shot with a lot of acidity from channeling.",1,1737022772.0,espresso,11,1.0,False
