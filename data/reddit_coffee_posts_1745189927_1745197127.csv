1k414v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1k414v9/what_actually_works_for_sensitive_skin_and_rosacea/,What actually works for sensitive skin and rosacea?,"I am 26 and have been struggling with my face turning red daily since I was around 17-18. Sometimes it does feel hot and uncomfortable other times I don’t even realize my face is bright red. People constantly think I’m “hot” or “embarrassed” and blushing. 

I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. So I don’t use products with fragrance and stuff targeted toward very sensitive skin. I use face reality’s line of skin care I get facials pretty regularly I’ve been able to get my acne under control a few years back but for the redness she’s basically told me there isn’t much she can do. 

My face flares up daily in the afternoon for hours straight but I noticed I can’t get into the sun at all even with sunscreen or my face is red in minutes and I use face reality sunscreen daily. Getting into a hot car, red face. Taking a shower, red face. 2 sips of alcohol, I’m a tomato. 

I’ve tried a redness correction make up by hero. I works but I’m someone who has very dark, sharp features so make up looks bad on me a feel personally. It also gives a matte look it’s very full coverage for me and yes most oily people like that but I’d prefer more of a skin tint if anyone knows one for color correcting redness?? 

I just wish I could get this under control. I’ve seen a lot of ppl say it’s ur diet but I don’t think I have the worse diet. I stay hydrated, I’ll drink maybe one soda a day or a coffee and the rest is water, I eat a decent diet with fruits, veggies, meat, the whole food pyramid. I do have a sweet tooth idk if that could make it worse? 

I just wish I could look nice in photos, not be out at a bar or dinner without being a tomato. I wish I could be at work and not flush as I work with the public. If anyone has any remedies at all. ",1,1745196757.0,Rosacea,0,1.0,False

1k413y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1k413y7/from_31_72_passed/,"From 31% —> 72%, Passed!","This exam is so doable. Please don't listen to people that try to scare you. If you've put in the hard work, the long hours, and you've got grit, you can do it. Posting this to be able to give hope to someone going through the process.
For context: I'm an extremely average student, got mostly Bs and Cs in my first 2 years of med school, wasn't an honors student/ not on dean's list, I was just trying to get by and pass my courses because the amount of information I had to learn was unreal. I'm not a good test-taker, I didn't even know how to study for the CBSE/step 1. The very first CBSE I took (no boards studying at this point, I only had the course knowledge) - I got a 31%. I knew my foundation was not strong, couldn't just pass with memorizing facts anymore, so I had to start from scratch. I studied for many months and did the school CBSE many many times but something wasn't clicking. I did a lot of boards and beyond, Sketchy, UWorld and RX to build my foundation from ground up. I got 31%, 35%, 44%, 46%, 57% on those cbses... My score was progressively increasing, but it was such a slow and tedious process. (Again, nobody said it was going to be easy). I was studying long hours but my scores were not hitting >60%. I saw my friends passing CBSE and step 1 within a few months and move onto clinicals. While I was stuck in your room, studying day in... day out... questioning why I was not smart enough, whether I will ever pass the cbse or step. its such a dark place. I'm sure I was in need of some sunlight, vitamin D, SSRIs and exercise, but all I wanted was to pass my cbse and step.

That's when I signed up for Kaplan Live program. That was 4 months long. There are lectures scheduled every morning 9 am - 12pm. I prepped for the lecture, I actively participated in every class discussion, I attempted to answer every question the teachers asked. I felt like I was a part of class again. Learning became fun again. I started to understand how to approach board style questions, how to identify HY concepts, I began to grasp the concepts so well. After the class, I reviewed the class content and practiced 1-2 blocks of questions every day. I also made time to go to the gym and workout for 1 hr everyday. These 4 months changed my life. Kudos to all my professors at Kaplan for believing in me, they were the most amazing mentors. Dr Barone, Dr Turco, Dr Harris, Dr White a huge shoutout to all of you.
After Kaplan, I scored a 63% on CBSE.


Self Studying Resources and How I used them:
One studying tip that worked magic for me: Add ALL YOUR NOTES IN ONE PLACE. Whether you're learning on bnb, UWorld, RX, sketchy, youtube... add everything to one place only. For me, that was a First Aid PDF on my ipad. I copy pasted all the UWorld images, concepts, highlighted terms, wrote out concepts that I got from qbanks onto FA. I did about 1-2 blocks of UWorld with the content review daily.
Biostats - Dr Randy Neil on Youtube teaches it like nobody else. Learn all the formulas, case control, cohort, OR, RR… Biostats should bring you all the easy points on your exam. But you gotta learn it properly once.
Biochem - Dirty Medicine. Such valuable resource for step.  He goes over all the most prominent pathways and associated diseases.
Immuno - Only BNB.
Micro - Sketchy Micro & BNB. Nothing else. Learn the virulence factors, learn the associated diseases, learn the characteristics and details (gram+/-, catalase +/-, RNA, DNAs, naked/enveloped etc)
Pharm - Sketchy Pharm & BNB. Nothing else. Learn the MOA, when they are used and their adverse effects. That's it. 
Ethics - Practice as many questions as possible. Don't follow your heart. Follow logic. I had about 5-6 ethics questions PER BLOCK on the real deal. My exam was very ethics heavy.
Path - I watched all of pathoma videos. Dr Sattar teaches you path so well, you don't need any other resource to build your path foundation. Such a valuable resource. Such an incredible teacher.

For all the Organ systems, (CVS, endocrine, renal, resp, heme/onc, MSK, derm, neuro, psych) I watched all of boards and beyond & pathoma videos and annotated onto my First Aid. If there was any images in the videos, i'd copy paste it into my FA and annotate it really well. That way, my review sessions became more and more efficient. 


During Dedicated:
Dedicated was truly the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. Especially if an practice exam or question block that didn't go well. It was stressful but just know that all your hard work will pay off at the end. 
I gave myself 3 months to study for step and I did every possible practice exam under the sun. Tbh if you do all of them, the real deal will feel like you are doing another practice exam. No stress. But you definitely need to build the stamina to sit for 8 hours straight without losing focus. The real deal felt like you are doing another NBME, but much much easier. 
I went through all of my notes in First Aid during the last month.
These were my scores in the last 3 of dedicated:
* First school cbse - 31%
* School cbse before dedicated 63%
* RX Practice test #1- 64%
* NBME 24 - 65%
* NBME 25 - 70%
* NBME 26 - 66%
* NBME 27 - 68%
* NBME 28 - 66%
* NBME 29 - 67%
* NBME 30 - 67%
* UWSA 1 - 61%
* UWSA 2 - 59% (it was a hard exam for me. But reviewed it and moved on)
* UWSA 3 - 50% (please don't do this exam. Had the worst panic attack after this. I lost so much confidence that day)
* Free120 NEW - 65% (4 days before the exam)
* NBME 31 - 72% (3 days before the exam)
* Free120 OLD - 72% (2 days before the exam, it is super straight forward test, buzzword heavy)
On the very last day of studying: I did Rapid Review, light reading, some last minute translocations, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, receptors... Also got some snacks for the exam day. Stopped studying around 7 PM. Prayed for the strength to go through whatever the day throws at me. I got 6 hours of sleep the night before so felt well rested before going in.


The Exam Day:
I ate a good breakfast, reached prometric, got signed in. I had packed coffee, granola bars, bananas, redbull. But the adrenaline of the exam will keep you going. I wasn't hungry much during breaks. I walked around to get the blood flowing, got some water, coffee and kept going. I went in with confidence that no matter what happens, I'll be okay. I went in with a clear mind and took one question at a time. 
I skipped the tutorial so I had a total of 60 mins for break. I did Block 1+2 together - 10 min break - Block 3 - 10 min break - Block 4 - 10 min break - Block 5 - 10 min break - Block 6 - 10 min break - Block 7 & Done. The day was over before I even knew it. 

2 weeks of waiting period was much harder than the test itself lol. All I could think about was the exam, and what's gonna happen. 

2 weeks later, GOT THE P!!! Happiest day of my life. 

I wrote this post to give someone hope that you can do it too. This journey is truly challenging, not just academically but also on our mental health. Make time for yourself, workout everyday, and keep your family close. You truly need your support system close to you when you’re going through this journey. For me, it was my husband, my mum and dad… they’ve supported me in my darkest times, I couldn’t have made it without all of their support. Don’t compare yourself with anyone else’s progress, I know it’s easier said than done, but deactivate your social media if that helps. You don’t anyone else’s approval other than your own. I was extremely depressed studying for this exam, had no confidence, wasn’t able to increase my scores for a long time. But never ever give up. Keep putting in the hard work every single day and don’t lose hope.  
All your hard work, long hours and practice will pay off. Just keep going. If you’ve set your mind to it, you will find a way. This is just a test, and you are more than capable of getting that P. 


TLDR: I've made it and the war is over. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. It does get better. Don’t ever give up on your dreams. ",4,1745196675.0,step1,0,1.0,False
1k4129j,https://i.redd.it/vmziqnsa53we1.jpeg,The Classic Long Room w/ Fireplace TV Placement Quandary,"I live in an older home that had multiple additions constructed over the years prior to my purchase. One of those additions now serves as the entrance to the house.

The space, as seen in the attached image, is rectangular in shape. 25' long and 15' wide. The challenge, at least for me, is where to place the TV which in turn leads to how to design the rest of the room.

Why I am struggling with this is due to the various ingress/egress points into the room. If you refer to the attached image, on the right, the main entrance/front door to the home is on the right wall. Upon entering through the front door a doorway leading to/from the garage is to your immediate right. A doorless passthrough leads to an office/dining room to the left of the front door.

The two options, as previously mentioned, leave me with two perceived quandaries.

If I place the TV on the wall on the garage door side I can certainly have a nice couch, rug, coffee table and accoutrements but this gives me the feeling of a media room more than a place to converse.

If I place the TV above the fireplace I can have a couch/chairs across from each other on the walls OR I use a couch parallel to the TV to in a sense create a boundary for the room as one walks in the front door with the idea of indicating a choice to go left (further into the house) or right (into the garage) unless one wishes to specifically engage in an activity in around the TV/Fireplace.

Overall, the drink consistently adds market share every quarter, and its partnership with Pepsi means it has access to its distribution network to be everywhere. They just bought Alani Nu, and when it is added to the Pepsi distribution network, this female energy drink could blow up as well.

What makes it the perfect tariff play is that, first of all, food stocks are extremely safe during recessions. At the end of the day, people still have to eat. Second of all, Coffee prices could skyrocket because of Tariffs. Not only can we not grow coffee in the United States, but we can't grow chocolate and vanilla. You need tropical climates to grow these products, and the crops need intensive labor. Madesgar grows most of the vanilla we buy, and we currently have a 47% tariff on them. If coffee prices skyrocket, consumers could switch to energy drinks to get their daily caffeine. This is what people aren't talking about. Celsius's biggest competitor is not Monster; it's Starbucks, and if they can start taking away coffee customers, the stock will skyrocket

Lastly, in a bear market, cash is king, and Celsius has almost a billion in cash. It's a cash flow-positive company with almost no debt, which means it can continue to acquire new brands at a low price, especially ones with heavy debt loads.",1,1745196290.0,DayTradingPro,0,1.0,False

1k40ywg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k40ywg/best_friend_chooses_exconvict_boyfriend_over_8/,Best Friend chooses ex-convict boyfriend over 8 year friendship,"Hi everyone, I am posting on behalf of my friend who we will name Jade, so settle in, grab some popcorn because this one is a doozy.

Jade (24f) has been ""best friends"" with a girl who we will call Ashley(26f) for 8 years. We all met Ashley at Jade's 18th birthday party of who she accompanied a friend of ours. We all became friends with her pretty quickly and slipped in to our friend group with ease. She was kind, was always down for a good time and very much portrayed herself as a ""girl's girl"".

A couple year's later, Ashley became pregnant with her long-term partner and we were all so excited to become auntie's to a special little girl. Unfortunately, her baby girl was born pre-maturely at 28 weeks and spent approx. 3 months in hospital in the NICU. This was a very traumatising time for Ashley and all of us were concerned for her mental health during this difficult time. We couldn't imagine what she was going through. Out of every one of her friends, Jade was consistently visiting and messaging Ashley to be there for her and do anything for her. As Jade and Ashley had become very close best friends over the last couple of years. Especially after Jade got Ashley a job at her workplace and started spending more time together in and out of work. Jade was definitely the one out of all of us who grew a closer friendship with her. She was consistently by her side during all of this, (was definitely the definition of an angel of a friend).

Fast forward over a year later, Ashley's landlord informed that her son would be released from jail and moving in next door and that is how we met Logan (20m). Logan came across kind and funny in the beginning. Even with a record, we came to know Logan more, especially Jade and Ashley. Ashley and Logan became very good friends while Jade and Logan became a lot closer but in a more romantic sense and started seeing each other (without a label). Since Ashley and Logan were neighbours, Jade started spending even more time over there of which this strengthened her friendship with Ashley and relationship with Logan. Ashley and Logan were very close but Jade was not worried as she trusted both of them as Ashley was still with her long-term partner raising a healthy little girl and Logan was absolutely infatuated with Jade.

A couple months down the track, Logan had become to distance himself from Jade in a romantic and physical way but still wanted her around. Jade had expressed her concern to me about this but wanted to see if this relationship would become of anything and if he was just going through a rough time due to the distance. Later on, I would then learn Jade had actually become afraid of Logan as he had quite bad anger issues and she was afraid to leave him in case something would happen. One instance he had lost his temper at his vehicle, he punched a hole in the wall of the garage and threw things around and hadn't realised he had hit Jade with something in his fit of rage. Once he had realised the bruise on her arm, his response was ""oh"" and moved on. No one had thought he was this kind of person as Ashley had trusted him alone with her child on many occasions.

Around Christmas time, Jade was staying with Logan for the night and noticed her name pop up on text messages between him and Ashley while she was sitting next to him. Logan didn't notice that she saw this and became very secretive over his phone. Jade had a bad feeling and decided to go through his phone once he had fallen asleep. She is not proud of this but is glad that she learnt everything then and not later down the track. What she saw was months of them talking horrible about her and making awful and degrading comments about her body, her family issues at the time, just down right nasty comments. As well as flirty comments towards Ashley. Which Ashley never informed Jade about (in my opinion - not very girl's girl as she made herself out to be). Plus multiple flirty messages to other girls. And when said girls would ask the status of him and Jade, he would explain that she was only his ""neighbour's friend"". Jade decided to leave in the morning as she wasn't in the right state to drive home as soon as she read those messages. In the morning, she called one of our other friends for advise as Logan had used her credit card to purchase things as he didn't receive a proper income due to his criminal record. Jade couldn't just leave without having her $700.00 debt being sorted but she knew if she confronted him, she wouldn't of received the money from him. Was also nervous to confront him due to the previously mentioned anger issues. He was to received a large sum of money in the new year so ultimately decided to move in the shadows ;), until she received the money. The following morning, she claimed there was a family emergency and left his house because she did not want to be around him.

One week later, Jade went on a winter New Year trip with her family and he was constantly messaging her acting all lovey dovey while she was still moving in the shadows. One night when she returned, Jade and I decided to go out on a girl's night dancing while he was at a concert with Ashley and others in a different city. Some point during the night, Logan found out we were hanging out with some people he absolutely hated and lost his cool over the phone to Jade. At this point, she had enough of him and did not want to be involved with him any longer, she confronted him about the messages between Ashley and the other messages to multiple girls. Of course he denied all accusations and became angrier with each confrontation Jade threw his way. And then threatened to put gang members on her. Meanwhile, Ashley was sitting right next to him while all of this is going on. Which lead to Jade blocking both Ashley and Logan on every social media.

A month later, I met up with a mutual friend over coffee and found out some more things about Ashley. It was mentioned to me that Ashley had never liked Jade and used her to get a job at her workplace.

A couple of days ago (4-5 months of radio silence), Ashley had found a way to message Jade wondering what had happened to their friendship and claims she had no idea what had happened the night of the messages between Jade and Logan. So the question is - does Jade ignore her message or succumb to her pettiness and message her letting her know that she knows everything and is aware that the friendship had been one sided for 8 years.

P.s in the messages, Jade had read Ashley shit talking about her partner and had been wanting to leave (they are no longer together now).",1,1745196241.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I need some advise regarding upgrading my my current samsung Q700C soundbar (without rears) to Q990D ($1450 CAD). I have added an image of my living room layout which shows that the seating is not centred. Also, the living room is open on one side joing the dining room. 
How would all this affect my experience?
Would it be worth the upgrade? 
Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks

I used to think loyalty was my greatest strength… how effortlessly I slipped into your life. I remember the first time I stepped through your door in the dead of night, rain beading on my coat, and you didn’t so much as glance at the clock before pulling me into your arms. Your apartment smelled like city streets and fresh laundry, and I thought I’d never find anything safer than the way your body curved around mine. I let you believe I didn’t mind being the constant: your midnight visitor, your Saturday morning coffee companion, the soft landing for your restless heat.

But habits die hard, and after months of “just us” and “no strings,” the ritual began to fray. I noticed the coffee mugs stacking in the sink, lipstick-smudged and forgotten, different shades that I’d never wear. Sometimes you’d brush past me on your way to the door without a backward glance. I told myself these were small things, unimportant things, but with every passing week, they pressed at my chest like a silent accusation: “You’re here because I let you be…” and “I’m not as yours as you’re mine”, it felt like.

So I chose one Friday night to test that conviction. I pulled on a dress I’d tucked in the back of my closet, emerald green silk, and stepped into a world that wasn’t yours. That night, I met someone who didn’t swallow me for convenience but leaned in, curious, about my stories, my dreams, even the freckle on my collarbone. We wandered out afterward, the night air cool against my bare shoulders, and I realized I’d forgotten what it felt like to be truly seen.

When I texted you, carefully, that I was meeting a friend, your veneer cracked immediately. The messages came in a torrent:

“Ellie, please tell me you’re kidding.”“I thought I’d have you until the end of time.”

And when I didn’t make it home that evening, sleeping at Hannah’s place: “I don’t know how to stop thinking about you.”

I haven’t answered. How could I, after you broke my heart one too many times? But I miss you.

1k40sdi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k40sdi,"Barcelo Maya (Beach) - Riviera Maya, Mexico","I just got back from Barcelo Maya Beach and wanted to give my honest review. I was there with a group of 50 people ranging from mid 20’s to 60’s for a wedding. 

Some of the photos are from other areas of the resort, not specifically the Beach section. 

Room:
My room was clean, cool (too cold actually) and in good condition. It wasn’t humid and no musty smells like some people have complained of. I was in 2293 Coba so literally the furthest room from the beach, so that could be why. 

It’s a large resort so we did a ton of walking… like 20k steps a day on days we stayed at the resort. I didn’t mind, it helped burn some calories since I ate 6 times a day while there. 

Food:
Despite what many reviews state, I had no issues with the food. It was lacking some flavour, but they have to cook for mass amounts of people so that’s to be expected. My only complaint with the food was that the stations where they cook specifically for you (omelette, pancakes, pasta, tacos) they are SLOW. I avoided those because I don’t have time for that. Couldn’t get enough of the carnitas though 😅

Service was excellent in the buffets. The second my immediate group of 8 walked in, we were greeted with our usual iced coffees and mimosas, whether we wanted it or not and they were quick to refill. I’ve stayed at a lot of AI resorts and it wasn’t bad, but I also haven’t had better. 

Restaurants: 
Mexican Lindo (I think that’s the name) - I wasn’t really hungry but they insisted I order all three courses. They brought guacamole, tortilla chips and some spicy salsa type stuff to start, it was delicious (guac a little flavourless). I had some kind of chili pepper queso soup, it was fine but I wasn’t hungry so I only ate half. They insisted I order a different appetizer since I didn’t finish that one, but I talked them out of it. I had the chicken fajitas and my husband had the sea bass & salmon. He loved his, mine was good but they gave me wayyy too much. I barely eat one and they had enough for 5. After I ate both of our desserts - milk cake? And tiramisu. Both were delicious. I like cake, no cake is bad. 

Italian - I forget the name, it’s next to Tokyo.  There was supposed to be appetizers and a salad bar but half of the things on the menu were actually there. I heard great things about the mozza balls, which apparently you have to order since they aren’t at the salad bar as stated. When I ordered it, they were a bit sassy with me because I was already eating my main but they brought me it anyway and it was mediocre. Not bad, but from the reviews I had high expectations. Regardless, I ate it. We had a group of 4 this night and everyone had a different meal and one member had 2 mains and we all enjoyed ours. It wasn’t the best Italian… but I’ve had worse. We’re on vacation, I have low expectations but enjoy eating so I eat it anyways. For dessert I had some kind of chocolate coffee cake that was delicious. 

Tokyo - who doesn’t like teppanyaki? We had a group of 10 this night and had a variety of appetizers, mains and desserts and didn’t hear a single complaint. I had the chicken as my main and it was good but not GREAT. I’ve spent a lot of time in Asia so I have high standards for teppanyaki. Everyone else LOVED it. I ate it all anyways. 

Overall, the service was excellent the portions were huge and the experience was great at each of them. I don’t have any actual complaints about any of them. 

Pool Bars - I spent most of my time at the adult only pool between Tulum and Coba because it was the closest to my room and I’m lazy. Excellent service. There were always chairs too. Drinks were always good. My only “complaint” was that anytime I ordered a drink eg “pina colada” they were adding alcohol to it even if it came from the frozen drink machine and they weren’t hand making it. Even Shirley temples 😅. That’s not a real complaint though… I might not have been ready to start day drinking at 9am, but I was after my first drink 🤷‍♀️. There are worse problems to have. The other pool bars were pretty much the same. 

Jaguars - I (mid 30s F) had a great time on the bachelor/ette party night but I had too much to drink and was living my best life. When I went back three nights later I found it really loud and the music not great like other people had complained about but I’m old. If you’re in your 20s, you would probably like it. I found it difficult to order drinks so I wrote what I wanted on my “notes” app and showed my phone to the bartender when I wanted to order. Great service, but I also tipped 50$ on the bachelor/ette party night so they might have remembered me from then😂. 

Strikers - food is awful but also delicious when it’s 3am and you’re eating for the 6th time that day. The queso had no flavour and was always room temp but is there such thing as a bad nacho? I don’t think so. Mini golf is apparently much harder than you would expect, the lineup was always pretty long close to the end of the “free” time (7pm) so we never got it. Great service here, and probably the fastest service I saw at any bar in the resort. 

Chairs - like you’ve all heard, people reserve the chairs pretty early in the morning. I never had issues finding one though. We would usually take one chair for a large group of us but mostly we’re in the water. I had one issue where a woman thought I stole her chair (empty when I arrived) and she caused a huge scene and got aggressive as if she wanted to fight me. She would have won, but I stood my ground and kept my chair just to spite her. She stole my towel afterwards but I was there to have a good time so I continued living my best vacation life. I saw a few confrontations throughout the week of people having the same situation - the staff remove towels from chairs that are unoccupied for lengths of time. 

Overall, the chair situation was never an issue for me or the group I was with. If I didn’t have a chair, I laid on my towel and carried on with life. 

Cenotes - there are cenotes across the street. It’s like 50$ USD to visit the 4. You risk your life crossing the 8 lane highway but 100% worth it. The fish nibble your dead skin off but bit me a couple times. I’d do it again. It’s hot, a lot of walking. Don’t recommend doing it with young kids. Being a lot of water, there’s nowhere to get it once you’re in there. There are a lot of washrooms though. 

Resort Animals - there are a shit ton of lizards and a couple monkey-cat type animals around the resort. I was happy to have new friends and wasn’t bothered by them. Some people were scared easily by the lizards 🤷‍♀️. They have a dolphin there, I don’t support that and didn’t check it out. I know it can’t be released back to the wild at this point but I refused to see it. There are sea turtles at one end of the beach too if you go in the morning, several people in our group saw them but I never made it out that way at the right time. 

Illness - about half of our smaller group of 10 people got some kind of stomach bug (diarrhea and vomiting). It was intense, but very short lived (12 hours). It comes on fast and out of nowhere and made us extremely dizzy (one person fainted). I recommend bringing ginger gravol and pepto. 

Wedding - I’m a professional wedding photographer (despite those crap cellphone pictures I shared, don’t judge). I was so insanely impressed with the planning and coordination of the resort, their attention to detail and execution of everything. The wedding was held at the Palace and was absolutely amazing and beautiful. 

Overall, amazing trip. Any “complaints” are so minor they didn’t impact my trip at all. I’d 100% go back there again, and plan to take my young kids next time when we aren’t there to party. Every person in the group of 50 of us had a great time and every person I met there (other than crazy chair lady) was awesome & enjoying themselves.

1k40prn,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1k40prn/quitting_caffeine_and_insomnia/,Quitting caffeine and insomnia,"This is my quitting caffeine story.

I had a 1 cup a day habit for a few years.  No sleeping issues or withdrawal, even when I would stop for a few months. Then last year, I started with cortaditos. Sometimes 3 or 4 per day, Sometimes in the afternoon. This went on for a few months until I went on vacation and stopped all coffee for 2 weeks. 

That's when the early morning insomnia began.  I didn't make the connection until I started having cortaditos again and the issue resolved.

That's when I realized I was trapped if I didn't get out of this habit.  I didn't want to be dependent on caffeine in order to sleep properly for the rest of my life. So I quit cold turkey and the insomnia returned. This time, it was bad. Sometimes waking at midnight or 2am every night and not being able to get back to sleep.

I tried magnesium, which was somewhat helpful but it was hit and miss. I also tried other vitamins and herbal teas which didn't really work for me. I then realized I had to taper off gradually, which seems to have helped a bit. I now have half a cup of coffee per day (in the morning).

I went from sleeping 3 to 4 hours a night to 5 or 6 over a few months.  I'm now 4 months in and sometimes I get 7 hours and other times I get 5, but it's better than it was.

The thing that triggered the withdrawal was increasing caffeine intake with multiple cortaditos per day and then stopping it cold turkey. Hopefully my sleep normalizes back to 8 hours soon. I will keep you posted.

Far from the tragic accident purported in history, that incident was the work of the Empire. Alyia barely lived, a feat of her innate weather magic, but her home, family, and community were destroyed. Single-minded, Alyia joined the rebels and vowed to seek revenge on their attackers.

But the Empire is only the most powerful nation in the world, and Alyia is only a dead woman operating under a false identity. While persistent over the years, she's tired, poor, and almost ready to surrender herself into the next life. Her shoulders are weighed heavy by her inadequacy back then in saving the other members of her village and from her current failures to avenge their deaths.

Elija Kansi is a general. A chance encounter with him at a coffee shop reveals his weakness for her naive and beautiful appearance—he thinks she's an ordinary citizen, and if Alyia can get close enough, Elija's connections just might open up a chance for her vengeance to see the light of day. The catch? Elija has a sister in Vanlin Kansi. Belligerent, sharp, and loaded with suspicions, Vanlin harbors clear doubts about Alyia's reasons for spending time around Elija.

Alyia is desperate to atone for her sins. If she needs access to Elija for his military associations, then seducing Vanlin and finding a way to pass stolen info to the rebels might work just as well. Dangerously, part of Vanlin seems to see straight through the walls Alyia has built up around herself. Vanlin's irreverence for those barriers and the deep consideration she demonstrates towards Alyia makes pretending to fall in love an easy task but acting the normal, untraumatized civilian very difficult indeed...

So we decided to take a trip through our national parks; Jasper, Banff, Yoho.

We put on 2200 km in a week of traveling and here are our pros and cons/observations.

Pro

\- really great car to drive....except for the cons (see below).  Ride was nice, road noise was minimal, engine noise was Ok, no complaints with the DCT, really liked the adaptive cruise and there was no squeaks, creaks or groans and the Sorento handled the mixed weather of snow, sleet, rain and wind with minimal issues.

\- Engine has lots of get up and go.  We had about 90% highway driving and the Sorento handled it well.  Avg. 10.6l/100km, which was not bad for an engine that has just got broken in.  I know it will get better as the KM's add up.

\- We had the vehicle loaded up with two adults, a medium size dog and enough ""stuff"" for a week in the mountains.  There was barely enough room for a Costco run on the way home, but it fit!  The third row was not used.  There is lots of space in there for our stuff, which was one of the high priorities is picking a vehicle.

\- I set the HVAC/Radio touch control to HVAC and ran the radio off the steering with zero issues.  Lots of SirriusXM in the mountains!  So we had no issues with the touch controls.  Bose system rocked!!  Literally!!

Cons

\- The Sorento has one of the most uncomfortable passenger seats we have ever sat in!!  After about an hour, the wife's legs started to get numb and her back was aching.  Things that were not noticeable in the 20 min test drive became noticeable!!  The drivers seat is comfortable, so we switched and right away, I noticed the discomfort.  The bolsters were cutting into my leg, especially the right one.  And I have zero hips and a 35"" waist, so not overly large!.  We ended up buying a gel seat and back rest that made the rest of the trip tolerable.  When we got home, we took some measurements between the two seats.  The passenger seat is 0.5"" narrower, the bolsters are 0.65"" wider and 0.5"" higher than the driver seat and the actual seat between the bolsters is 1.3"" narrower .  The other thing is that the headrests are angled in so much that there is over 3.5"" of gap between the back of the seat and my wife's shoulders/back, which causes her to angel her head slightly forward to be comfortable.  I will post some pictures later.  Is there anyone else noticing this issue?  I want to see if this is a one off or is normal before I discuss with the dealer.  This seat is a deal braker for us if we cannot get it fixed!!!

\- Does anyone know how to turn off the Driver attention/take a coffee break warning system???  This is the most annoying tech in this vehicle!!!!  It went off no less than 15 times in 200km/2 hour drive in the windy mountain passes where we live!  Over the week, it went off at least 40 times.  I have been driving 45 years and now having to deal with some PITA tech that tells me I need a break while this brick on wheels was pushed around by wind and rough roads had me frustrated!.  Another possible deal breaker if this cannot be shut off!  I have tried all the suggestions here on Reddit and all have been swing and a miss.  Any ideas?

\- When driving in the snow/sleet, the front camera and radar system shut down and it kept letting me that....every 10 minutes!  Can this be shut off?

We really like the Sorento and it was our choice after a bunch of test driving and research.....but if we cannot get the above fixed, we will have to move on.  I know the seat issue is partly our fault as we should have spent more time just sitting in it, but the difference between seats seems to be a manufactures issue and I am going to be doing some digging into his.

Sorry for the long winded post; just wanted to discuss some pros and cons of the Sorento with others and see if there is anything that can be corrected.  


Cheers

A high-quality screen protector is an essential accessory,⁢ acting as ⁤a shield ‌against everyday wear and tear.

## Key Features Analysis

The best ipad air screen protectors of 2025 offer a blend of advanced materials and precision engineering.

**Material Composition:** These protectors are predominantly crafted from tempered glass or pet​ film with ⁢advanced ⁣coatings.Tempered glass offers ⁣superior scratch resistance and impact absorption, typically boasting a‍ hardness rating of 9h on the ⁤mohs scale. Pet film provides flexibility and shatter resistance,⁤ often featuring ‌multiple layers for added protection.

The choice between tempered glass ⁤and pet film depends​ largely⁢ on individual priorities. Tempered glass⁣ excels in preventing scratches from sharp objects and mitigating damage ​from accidental drops.Pet film,on the other hand,minimizes the ‌risk ​of shattering and maintains a slimmer profile. The ideal material⁤ effectively ‌balances durability with minimal impact on ⁤screen responsiveness and clarity.

**Clarity and Transparency:** ‍Premium screen‌ protectors are engineered for optimal light transmission and minimal distortion. High-transparency materials, often exceeding 95% clarity, ⁤ensure vibrant⁣ colors‍ and sharp details remain visible on‌ the ipad air's retina display.Anti-glare coatings further enhance‌ visibility in brightly lit environments by diffusing reflections.The clarity of a screen⁣ protector directly impacts the viewing experience. Low-quality protectors can introduce haziness or reduce color accuracy. Top-tier options maintain the ipad air's‌ original display quality, providing a crystal-clear view without ​compromising protection.

**Touch Sensitivity:** ⁤An essential​ aspect‌ of any screen protector is its ability to preserve ⁢the ipad air's touchscreen responsiveness. Advanced protectors ⁢feature​ ultra-thin designs and optimized adhesives to ensure seamless touch interactions. they support precise stylus⁢ input for drawing and writing, ​maintaining fluid and accurate control.

The⁣ thickness⁤ and adhesive properties of⁤ a screen protector play a critical role in ⁤touch sensitivity. Overly thick protectors can create a ⁣noticeable‌ gap‌ between ⁢the finger ⁤and the screen, reducing responsiveness. Similarly, poor-quality adhesives can interfere with touch⁤ detection. leading screen protectors utilize ultra-thin materials and meticulously engineered adhesives to​ minimize these issues.

**Oleophobic Coating:** ⁤Fingerprints and smudges are common annoyances on touchscreen devices. Oleophobic coatings are⁣ designed to resist oils and reduce fingerprint visibility. These coatings create a smooth, easy-to-clean surface that ⁣repels oils and resists smudging, maintaining⁤ a ⁢clean and clear display.

The effectiveness of an oleophobic coating diminishes over time with regular use. ‌High-quality screen protectors feature durable coatings that withstand repeated cleaning and resist wear. This ensures long-lasting protection against fingerprints and smudges, maintaining a clean and pleasant viewing experience.

**Installation Process:** The installation⁢ process can be a notable determining factor in user satisfaction. Screen protectors featuring easy-application designs and bubble-free adhesives simplify the installation process. Alignment tools and detailed instructions ‍further assist ​users​ in achieving a ⁣perfect, seamless fit.

Many screen⁢ protectors now come with ‌applicator frames that precisely align the protector with the ipad​ air's‌ screen. Self-adhesive‍ designs ‌and air-exhausting adhesives further minimize‍ the risk of ⁤bubbles. ‍Clear and concise instructions are crucial for guiding users⁣ through the installation⁣ process, ensuring a smooth and ​hassle-free experience.

1k40blv,https://i.redd.it/3ymy88p9x2we1.png,Why Quitting Feels So Hard: Understand Negativity Bias,"**Are you trying to quit smoking or vaping?** Your brain might be working against you—without you even realizing it.

Negativity bias hijacks your thoughts, making cravings feel stronger and doubts seem more convincing. But here’s the truth: **you can take your mind back.**

# 💔 When One Harsh Moment Feels Bigger Than All the Good

You give your best for years—loving, showing up, supporting in every way you know how. And then, in a single painful moment, it’s as if none of it mattered.

A careless comment. A cold shoulder. A silent judgment that cuts deeper than words.

Suddenly, your brain locks onto the worst thoughts:

""Why do I even try?""

""I must be the problem.""

""No one sees how hard I'm working.""

From that point on, everything wrong becomes magnified:

Who didn’t say hello…

Who didn’t check in…

Who seemed distant or cold…

Meanwhile, the good—the soft smile, the hand-delivered coffee, the quiet gesture, the fleeting moment of grace—barely registers.

This is negativity bias in action. And when you're trying to quit smoking or vaping, it can be relentless—working quietly beneath the surface, steering you back toward old coping mechanisms before you even realize what's happening.

# 🧪 What Is Negativity Bias?

Negativity bias is your brain’s built-in survival mechanism—designed to keep you safe and alert to potential threats.

**It causes you to:**

* Focus more on bad events than good ones
* Give more emotional weight to criticism than praise
* Remember painful moments more vividly than joyful ones
* You **fear the worst-case scenario** even when evidence says otherwise—just like the man afraid to drive, even though his car isn’t actually on fire.

Your brain doesn’t always distinguish between **real threats** and **imagined ones**—but **awareness lets you take control**.

Just like the anxious driver in the image needs to trust the reality of the road, not the fear in his mind, you can shift your focus away from negativity and toward truth.

Negativity bias was meant to protect you—helping your brain highlight painful experiences so you could avoid danger in the future. But today, instead of safeguarding you, it can work against you—keeping you trapped in cycles of self-blame, fear, and hopelessness.

Negativity bias isn’t just a fleeting negative thought—it’s a deep-rooted pattern we all experience, especially in a world overwhelmed by chronic stress. When life is hard, the brain starts searching for evidence to confirm its worst fears. The news, social media, even the wrong kind of entertainment can keep negativity bias running on high alert. And for those who have faced trauma, PTSD, or deep wounds, it doesn’t just influence emotions—it shapes reality.

Without realizing it, many people reach for smoking or vaping as a way to quiet the storm inside, not knowing that their own mind is quietly reinforcing the cycle. The question is, will you choose what truly helps you heal? Whether it’s faith, supportive relationships, or new ways to care for yourself—there are choices that lead to life, not destruction.

The good news? **Awareness changes everything**. When you recognize that your brain is over-emphasizing danger, you can override that instinct, reframe your thinking, and take control of the path forward.

# ⛓️‍💥 Breaking Free: Why Negativity Bias Makes Quitting Harder

When you quit, your brain—adjusting to the absence of nicotine—goes through withdrawal, triggering stress responses. Thoughts will arise that challenge your decision. But here’s the truth: you don’t have to believe everything you think.

Negativity bias distorts reality, making setbacks feel like proof of failure. It doesn’t just affect cravings—it affects how you see yourself, your past, and even your deepest beliefs. It whispers, “You’re weak.” “You’ll never change.” “If God really cared, He wouldn’t have let this happen.” These thoughts feel real, but they are not the truth—they are your brain searching for evidence to confirm its fears.

A slip may lead to relapse. Slipping off a cliff doesn’t offer a second chance. An alcoholic can’t fall off the wagon without consequence. So why do people frame nicotine addiction as something where slipping is expected and normal? It’s dangerous. You’ve already made the decision to stop—now, it’s about resetting your brain and body completely.

**The Golden Rule** is simple: never take a single puff. Hold to that, and relapse is off the table. If quitting is your decision, then you’re free—the only task now is stepping out of the thinking that supports relapse.

And what’s waiting on the other side of withdrawal, detox, and cravings? Freedom. Energy. Vitality. Joy. Peace. A renewed appreciation for life’s simple pleasures—food, water, intimacy, meaningful connections, creativity, and most importantly, your spirituality.

Smoking and vaping destroy both body and soul, making it harder to connect with God through your spirit. But even that barrier isn’t impossible to overcome. God does not want you bad-mouthing one of His most precious and unique treasures—you. He will strengthen you in your quit efforts; ask for His help.

*For it is written, ""But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.""* ***Isaiah 40:31***

# 📱 Why Distraction and Digital Noise Make It Worse

When your mind is constantly pulled in different directions—social media drama, gossip threads, endless multitasking, comparison scrolling—it becomes harder to notice anything good.

These distractions don’t just clutter your thoughts; they fuel negativity bias, amplifying insecurities and reinforcing self-doubt. They keep your attention scattered, filling the gaps with meaningless noise until negativity becomes the default.

Instead of seeing your progress, your brain locks onto what’s missing, what’s wrong, and why you’re not enough.

But here’s the truth: you have control over what you consume. Choosing what fills your mind is just as important as choosing to quit.

Negativity bias thrives on distractions—on the noise that keeps you stuck. But the antidote is simple: shift your focus.

*""Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things."" –* **Philippians 4:8**

When cravings come, when doubts whisper, choose where your mind will go. Will you dwell on fear? Or will you redirect toward truth, strength, and freedom?

The choice is yours. And every time you choose what builds you up, you break free a little more.

🌱 How to Break the Cycle and Heal  
  
You can rewire your brain. And you don't need perfection to start—just intention.

📗1. **Track Your Wins—Even the Smallest**

""I walked through a craving.""  
""I drank water instead of vaping.""  
""I paused and prayed instead of reacting.""

Keep a **Victory Journal** and write down the moments where you resisted urges. Seeing the proof of your progress **changes everything**.  
It's not a big enough so. *Celebrate every step forward, and reward yourself then new pathways will wire together.*  
  
🧠 2. **Speak Truth to Your Thoughts—Break Negativity Bias**

When cravings hit or doubts creep in, say out loud:  
""This hurts, but it's not the whole truth.""  
""I'm not where I was last week.""  
""God is not done with me yet."" (Philippians 1:6)

*Your brain will believe what you tell it, so tell it, truth.*  
  
💬 3. **Treat Yourself Like You Would a Friend**  
Would you call your best friend a failure for slipping once? Then don't say it to yourself. You're learning. You're healing. Instead connect with a friend and have fun! Live, Laugh! Smile! Connection rewires the mind—so make moments that lift you up. Don't forget your camera!

* **Dance!** Blast a feel-good song (maybe James Brown’s ""I Got You (I Feel Good"") and shake off the tension.

* Host a **picnic in the park**—good food, fresh air, and laughter heal the soul.

* Cook a **simple, home-cooked meal** and invite loved ones to share it.

* **Go outside.** Breathe fresh air, feel the sun, reset your senses.

*Healing isn’t just about what you quit—it’s about what you* ***invite back into your life.***  
  
📵 4. **Quiet the Noise**

Take social media breaks  
Avoid gossip  
Choose stillness, music, prayer, journaling—anything that lets truth surface.

# 🌊 Craving Hacks: Rewire Your Brain in the Moment

Your brain builds habits through repetition. Every time you act on a craving, you reinforce the smoking/vaping pathway. But the good news is—your brain can change.

The moment you feel the cue—whether it’s a **thought, sensation, or emotion**—interrupt it immediately. Instead of letting it pull you toward nicotine, redirect down a new pathway—one that leads to freedom.

🔎 **Pick an object and study it mindfully**—anchor yourself in the present. Go outside—fresh air clears your mind and resets your body. Pick an object and study it mindfully. Get into nature.

🌎 **Anywhere** 🌬 **Breathe deep & slow**—inhale for four seconds, hold for four, exhale for four. Repeat.

❄️ **Drink ice-cold water**—it sends a fresh signal to your brain and body.

🍏 I**s it time for a crunchy snack**—tricks your brain into thinking it's satisfied.

📱 **Text a friend for encouragement**—connection breaks cravings fast.

🏃 **Move your body—**take a quick walk. Physical movement resets the urge. Take a lap around the office. Do some jumping jacks whatever floats your boat!

🙏 **Pray**—ask God for strength, remind yourself that He is lifting you through this.

🌊 **Mindful Reset:** Ride the Wave Sit in a quiet place and as the craving increases, imagine it as a wave in the ocean—rising and passing over you. Let it peak and wane without reacting.

Cravings feel powerful, but they are temporary. Every time you choose the new pathway instead of the old, you’re actively rewiring your brain toward freedom. As withdrawal completes, nicotine receptors dissolve, and cravings fade significantly. However, they can resurface when triggered by thoughts or memories—sometimes even up to two years later, according to researchers in this field. The key? Don’t dwell on pro-smoking or vaping thoughts and emotions. Shift your focus to healing instead.

# Final Thoughts

Quitting nicotine isn’t just about breaking a habit—it’s about rewiring your brain, reclaiming your health, and taking back control of your future. In a world that thrives on stress and negativity, understanding how your mind and body work gives you the edge to rise above cravings, self-doubt, and old patterns.

No one can be positive all the time. But action rewires the mind faster than thought alone. When you choose to act in hope—even when you don’t feel it—your brain perceives it as real and responds with healing. Change isn’t just about what you believe. It’s about what you do.

Healing isn’t just about quitting an addiction—it’s about walking in purpose, trusting in renewal, and embracing the journey with strength. When you move forward without doubt, believing in the process and in God’s ability to restore, your body, soul, and spirit respond with genuine healing.

You are not alone, and you don’t have to figure this out on your own.

My wife and I reached our vacation rental in the mountains. When we saw the listing, we knew it was “the one” for our long weekend getaway. It was a small guest house with a private entrance, green space, a deck, and a small backyard tucked against the pines. The house is removed from downtown, yet only a short 15-minute drive to bars and restaurants. Perfect.



We checked ourselves in using the keypad. My wife waited in the car while I swept the house, a precaution we always take—you can never be too safe. 



“I’ll be right back.”



I unlocked the front door and stepped inside. At first glance, the home looked recently updated and even nicer than the listing photos. 



“Darcy is going to love this place,” I said out loud.



The floors appeared to be the original hardwood planks. Large picture windows with views of the surrounding forest and mountains lined the walls. A fireplace anchored the main living area, hugged by a cozy sofa and love seat. 



I proceeded to the kitchen. On the counter next to the farmhouse sink, a note:



*Welcome to PineHouse!* 



*To make your stay as enjoyable as possible, please do not deviate from our house rules:* 

* *The house is old. Pipes will make noise. Don’t be alarmed*
* *Don’t enter the woods after 11 pm*
* §∆



I paused for a moment and tried to make sense of the demands. I reread the note, but couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. What do the symbols mean? And why would someone go into the woods at night? 



“No reason to alarm Darcy.”



I hid the note in a drawer and continued my sweep of the house. 



I opened the pantry and found the coffee maker and a few extra bowls and pans—nothing unusual. On the way to the primary bedroom, there was a door with a keypad lock and a small framed note reading, “For Host Use Only.” Typical of rental properties.



The primary bedroom had high ceilings and a king-sized bed covered in pillows. It smelled fresh, like lavender. I opened the closet, found a few hangers, then looked through the en suite bath—all clear. 



Only the guest bedroom remained. 



As I entered the spare room, I was suddenly met with the foul stench of wet earth and decay. Before I could pinpoint the source of the repulsive smell, my attention quickly snapped to the back of the room. 



The back door was left wide open.



My heart skipped a beat. I moved quickly toward the door to peer outside, looking for any signs of disturbance.



In the distance, another house nestled deeply into the woods was visible.  It had a single window illuminated near the pitch of the roof, giving away position. It was an old A-Frame painted deep black, camouflaging it amongst the trees in the darkening sky.



The slate colored dwelling almost looked like it was alive, feeding on the forest. Stalking *this* house with its single lit-up eye. 



*Watching me.*



I felt drawn in, almost under a spell. I couldn’t look away as though the structure put me into a trance state.



“*HEY!!!*” my wife bellowed sharply as she lurched at me.



“Jesus, you scared the living hell out of me!” She always got a kick out of startling me. It worked a little too often.



“Watcha staring at!?”



At least my wife hadn’t seen the door unlocked, wide open for anyone curious enough to sneak in. She was also spared the image of the black dwelling in the woods and its lone gaze devouring the forest seared into her mind. 



“Nothing.”



She would have demanded that we cancel and find another place. I pulled myself away, shut the door, and twisted the deadbolt. 



••



That night, without warning, I woke up abruptly. Three sounds reverberated from somewhere *inside* the house. The first sound was sharp, the second dull and drawn out, the last *booming*.



Knock. *Draaaagg…* *BAAANGGG!!*



I looked anxiously at the clock: 2:17 am. 



I grabbed my phone and pocket knife from the nightstand, quietly slipped out of bed, and began to search the house. As I moved between rooms, the floorboards moaned, aching from old age. The air was still, and I could hear myself breathing heavily. My heart was pounding as I found my way through the dark, unfamiliar home.



I made it to the guest room and checked the back door. It wasn’t open, but it also wasn’t locked. 



Shit. 



I opened the door to survey the backyard. The forest was pitch black now. Even the house deep in the woods was blanketed in darkness, the window no longer lit. I let out a deep sigh of relief, stepped back inside, and locked the door tightly.



*Breathe.*



*“The house is old. Pipes will make noise. Don’t be alarmed.”*



••



The next evening, a little after 11:30 pm. We had just finished watching a movie and were ready to call it a night. This time, I double-checked both external doors. After the first day, I wasn’t taking any chances. 



First, the front door: locked tight.



I started walking toward the guest room. Through the window off the kitchen, I could hear the wind howling. The trees were violently swaying in the darkness. The window was open, and the earthy smell of evergreen invaded the room.



I made my way to the back door to find it was wide open again.



Shit. Shit.



In the distance, in front of the decaying house in the woods, a bonfire had been ignited. Its flames shot up through the canopy of the trees, threatening the night. The flickering orange light danced amongst the canopy of the forest. The thick, heavy smell of smoke circulated in the midnight air.



Against better judgment, I exited the house, closing the distance between me and the edge of the woods. I made my way onto a small path that cut through the forest toward the A-frame, advancing quietly toward the fire. 



A dozen yards in, I saw something tucked between the trees. A silhouette of a person standing 30 yards away. They weren’t moving. They just stood there. 



I couldn’t see their face, but I could feel them gazing directly at me. Like they’d been watching me the entire time. A wave of anxiety and panic washed over my mind. My heart beat against my chest. 



RUN BACK TO THE HOUSE.



""*Don’t enter the woods after 11 pm.”*



••



The next night, I was jolted awake: 2:17 am again. There were noises resonating from inside the house. This time, the sounds were long, jagged like teeth, and clawing against walls.



Scraatcch. Scraaaaatch.



Darcy woke up. She looked panicked, pale, as if she’d seen a ghost. “Did you hear tha…?”



*Scraaaaaatttccccch.*



The hair on my neck stood straight up, nerves on fire. I jumped out of bed, slowly moved into the living room, and passed the kitchen. As I turned the corner, I saw it. The back door was wide open. 



“No. Not again.”



I looked at the adjacent wall of the guest room. This time, the closet door was also gaping open. The dresser inside moved to the right, exposing a hole that led to a hidden room. A crawl space that shouldn’t be there. It didn’t fit the layout of the house.



My nerves electrified like lightning and coursed through my body. My mind and body screamed to turn the other way. But after everything I’d seen and been through, I just had to know.



I crouched down and made my way inside the crawl space. I turned on the flashlight and began canvassing the hollow space. The air was still. There were no windows. The floors were unfinished and made of earth. The room smelled like decay, damp with a faint hint of copper.



In the center of the room was an object I couldn't quite make out. I moved nervously closer. My heart pounded, trying to escape my chest. The walls felt like they were closing in on me.



A black box.



It looked heavy, about 12 inches square. A thick red liquid was seeping from the bottom across the dirt floor. I froze as I further inspected the box. On the upper right corner, two symbols were imprinted in wet ebony paint:



§∆



Suddenly, I heard Darcy dart into the guest room behind me. She sounded panicked.



“*Where are you!*?” she cried.



“Whatever you do, do *NOT* come in here!”



“We have to leave\*,\*” I said desperately. “Darcy, pack up our things and get in the car. I'll be right behind you.”



“What the hell is going on!?”



“I’ll explain on our way home. Right now, I just need you to trust me. We need to leave… *NOW.*”



I began to make my way out of the crawl space when I suddenly felt a hand grab my left ankle, dragging me back inside. I tried to kick free, screaming in horror, but its grip was too tight.



I turned around quickly to see what had me in its clutches.



It was a woman wearing a cloak. Her long, jet-black hair spewed out from the opening of the hood, covering most of her sunken face. Her arms were long and spindly. Her hands were twisted. Her long nails were sharp, broken, and black.



She released me as I saw her pull a knife from inside her cloak. She managed to plunge the knife into my shoulder, barely missing vital organs. I could hear her chanting words under her breath. I screamed in horror as she twisted the knife, wrenching it deeper into my flesh. She quickly pulled the blade out as a river of blood ran down my arm.



If I don't act now, I'm never leaving this house alive.



I grabbed a handful of dirt from the floor and threw it in her face. She dropped the knife to shield her face and wipe away the earth. This is my chance.



My heart racing, shoulder throbbing, I crawled as quickly as I could out of the hidden room. I got to my feet and ran out the front door. Darcy had already started the car. Headlights on, ready to escape.



I  hauled down the long, narrow dirt road away from the house. Darcy was in shock, crying, and I felt overwhelmed with panic. As we continued to descend the driveway, I took one last glance in the rearview mirror at the guest house.



The front door was now wide open. The *witch* was running out of the house, knife in hand… *running after the car,* *shrieking.* She reached the end of the driveway and abruptly stopped. She was just standing there, staring, as we continued to drive away, the house vanishing from view.



••



An hour later, Darcy was still understandably distraught. She interrupted the silence.



“Wh… why was there a hidden room behind the closet!? Why are you bleeding!?”



I didn’t know how to explain what had happened. The witch was *living in the house.* In that secret room. We’d broken her rules.

1k4000r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1k4000r/carnival_horizon_trip_report/,Carnival Horizon trip report,"Just got off the Carnival Horizon 8 day cruise. This was my second carnival ship, previously tried and liked the Magic. Sailed with my 2 kiddos ages 3 and 8. 

Pros: I found there were lots of things to do in this ship (more than on the magic). The food in the MDR was mostly very good. Most of the staff were lovely (no change there from my previous experience). The kids club was amazing (my little one always asked me to drop him at kids club) and the Seuss bookville library was fun to unwind and read a book or two before bedtime. 

We had a family harbour room, which was so amazingly convenient. Lots of snacks and specialty coffee for free 24/7, just a few steps away from the room. 

Cons: smart elevators suck! I never had to wait long for an elevator on the magic, even with the dumb elevators. On the Horizon, the wait for elevators was consistently 5+ minutes (we waited 16 minutes once and the only reason I did not use the stairs was that I had my youngest in the stroller- otherwise we regularly “just” hauled our butts up and down from the 2nd deck to 10/11/12, even my 3 year old. 

The other con is that the ship seems to be held together with duct tape and Elmer’s glue. The Magic definitely felt more solid. There were numerous water leaks in the cabins on our deck (not ours fortunately). 

The plastic cover over the fob thing on my door fell off every single time. My room attendant kept putting it back and it would fall off again the next time I touched my card to it. It wasn’t just our door either, we saw more and more doors without the cover as the cruise went on. 

Some of the wallpaper on the walls was peeling. There were random pieces of electrical tape hanging from the ceiling. Some of the ceiling tiles seemed to have warped. It all felt a bit cheap. 

The worst: this really soured me unfortunately. this cruise had the highest number of rude entitled people I have ever ran into in an 8 day span. Don’t get me wrong most people were very friendly or just kept to themselves, which is fine. However, there were many instances of people acting super entitled, especially around food. 

Examples: One middle aged lady (aka who should already know her manners) tried to butt in front of my 8 year old at the self serve ice cream machine. He’s very shy and would not have said anything but I was standing right there so I saw the whole interaction, and I told her to get back to her place in line. 

At the pizzeria, people taking 3-4 pizzas at a time even when there is a line. Sometimes there is no pizza that is ready so you have to wait for a few minutes for a pizza to come out of the oven. No big deal. What I witnessed twice is people taking all the pizzas as soon as they come out so if you’re like 3rd or 4th in line you’re waiting forever. There was one guy who took both pizzas that were available on the table then stayed in line and when the cook pulled out 3 fresh pizzas he took all 3 of them on top. Who does that? I felt bad asking for a half pizza because I saw lots of people behind me waiting in line and I had a sense people were so oblivious about how their actions affect others. 

One time we were in the sports square where there is a soccer /billiards combo game with soccer balls. My little one loves soccer and he waited nicely for his turn, when the people who were playing left, he went into the square to kick some balls around. Not 5 minutes later grown men (probably around 30 y.o but definitely old enough to know that you have to wait your turn) kicked my son off the pitch. I again stepped in and told my son wasn’t finished and that they needed to wait their turn, which they did and didn’t seem to be mad but who does that?

Finally, the thing that made me the most sad and mad of all I’ve witnessed: people leaving their garbage and half eaten plates of food wherever they happen to be standing. There were containers with ice cream on the stairs that someone had tripped over and a pool of chocolate ice cream on the carpet, dishes with food on them in the elevators, half finished drinks in the middle of the hallway on the floor, the sticky liquid just waiting to be kicked overdo it could spill in the floor and someone a few doors down from me left a dirty diaper outside his door every morning. If everyone acted like that the ship would be a pig sty and yet some people seem to be so oblivious. 

All in all, we had a fun trip but I think we are now more open to trying another cruise line and hopefully there would be a more considerate demographic? I think we got lucky on the Magic because those instances of rude behavior were very few and people kept the place mostly clean. What I witnessed on the Horizon was really shocking.

1k3zvng,https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenet/comments/1k3zvng/john_did_it_my_theory/,John did it (my theory),"
It is my belief that John Ramsey killed his daughter JonBenet, and he committed the entire crime- including the staging and the ransom letter- entirely by himself. Let me explain. 

Like many people before me, I found the murder of JonBenet Ramsey extremely puzzling, an enigma that seemed unsolvable. As we all know, part of the reason the case has been very confusing because the evidence seems to point in all different directions. However, when you take a step back you will see that by looking at this case through a very certain lens, the theory that John did it all makes perfect sense. 

To start with, we need a brief refresher on the evidence and the circumstances, which I’m not going to go into extreme detail with because I’m sure many people on this thread are very familiar with even the finer details of the case. But for the sake of a memory refresher, here’s a quick recap on the relevant evidence:

A child was found murdered in her own home with a potential sexual assault taking place. The ransom note, the paper on which it was written, the pen that was used to write with, the paint brush used as a garrote (and with which to possibly assault her), the duct tape on her mouth, and the blanket she was covered in were all items from the house. While there is some evidence to indicate that there could have possibly been an intruder, the evidence is quite thin to say the least.

JonBenet had evidence of potential sexual trauma, there was a possibility that blood was wiped clean from her general pelvic area. She was found with a rope/garrote around her neck, a severe cranial injury, duct tape was placed on her mouth post death (or when she was unconscious), and her hands were bound. According to the autopsy, there is indication that she was forcefully shaken at some point as well. 

A neighbor claimed to hear a scream roughly at midnight, although to be fair, this cannot be proven. 

Statistically, speaking, when a child is molested within the home is is most likely the father or the nearest adult male. 

Given that recap of the evidence, here is what I personally believe what happened that night, as told from the perspective of John. 

It is roughly midnight and John is in the basement sexually molesting his daughter. At some point, he accidentally injures her in a way that he did not intend- this could potentially be what caused the damaged hymen and/or the bruise found near her cervix. When this injury occurs, JonBenét suddenly lets out an ear piercing scream- this is the scream that the neighbor claimed to hear roughly at midnight. John, usually a very self contained and composed man, is startled by the sudden scream, and for a split second loses his self control. In a moment of frantic panic and in order to quickly silence her, John, without thinking, loses control and strikes her over the head with the flashlight. Upon this, Jonbenet is immediately is knocked unconscious. 

There is a moment of stunned silence, then abject horror sets in as John realized what just happened, the implications, and the gravity of the situation. He immediately runs to the bathroom (to add- there was a powder room in the basement) and grabs a wet paper towel or something similar to clean up JonBenets vaginal area. He realizes he must do this immediately because he is certain that Patsy would have heard the scream and will come rushing down the stairs at any moment. He quickly cleans the blood that was produced when the injury occurred, rushing before Patsy comes down the stairs. Because this injury and the resulting blood is obviously extremely incriminating, he must do his best to hide it as soon as possible and attends to this first. At this point, his mind is already racing with excuses, trying to come up with explanations as to what happened. 

A minute goes by, and Pasty does not come down the stairs. Another minute goes by and still Pasty does not come. It occurs to John that somehow Patsy and Burke somehow did not hear the scream and continued to sleep upstairs. Temporary relief flows through him as he realizes he has a bit of time to collect his thoughts and come up with an excuse or a plan. At this point, this is when he starts violently shaking JonBenét, trying to jolt her into regaining consciousness. This is when, as the autopsy indicates, the ‘shaking’ occurs. He continues to try to revive her, by shaking her and possibly other means- slapping her, cold water to the face, etc. I also believe that he propped her up into an upright position, leaning her against the wall outside the wine cellar, while trying to revive her. I would guess that this is when she urinated; a common occurrence that happens when your body is shutting down or receives a severe injury. When it becomes apparent that she is not going to regain consciousness without medical intervention, he starts to panic. 

John is a very intelligent man. He knows that he cannot simply drive JonBenet to the hospital without waking Patsy first- as any parent would know, if one were to innocently find a child unconscious in the middle of the night, you would of course wake up your spouse. He also knows that if he does in fact wake up Patsy, she’s naturally going to have a many questions for him. How did this happen? Did you find her like this? Did she fall? How did you hear her and I didn’t? Were you already awake? What were you doing up? There are going to be lots of awkward questions that he does not have a succinct answer to. And of course, like any concerned mother, Patsy is going to want to immediately take her to the hospital.

While thinking this through, John notes that Jonbenet is still not regaining consciousness, her breathing is probably becoming more labored/faint by the moment, the color is probably leaving her face, and that if he was going to take her to the hospital, he has a narrow window to save her life that is closing slowly by the moment. 

However, John realizes that he cannot take Jonbenet to the hospital without severely incriminating himself. As previously stated, John is a very smart man. He knows that the doctors are going to take one look at that particular head injury and know that it did not come from falling down the stairs, running into the corner of a table, or whatever excuse he already frantically wracked his brains to come up with. Additionally, the doctors are going to inevitably see the trauma that has been done to the vaginal area and to say that they will be suspicious is putting it extremely mildly. He is the only adult male in the house, Patsy would not be suspected, Burke is a nine year old child, and anyway they would both say that they were asleep when John woke them up to take JonBenet to the hospital. All signs would point directly to him. He also makes the realization that if they are able to save JonBenét, which at this point they could probably still do, when she regains consciousness she would tell the doctors what happened. 

It is at this moment that John realizes that he is completely fucked. If he wakes up Patsy, she is of course is going to want to take JonBenet directly to the hospital. And if they take JonBenét to the hospital, the only way that he is leaving is handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser. Being the rational man he is, he notes the negative consequences that this will have not just on him but on his whole family as well. He would go to jail (where he would possibly be murdered), his reputation beyond ruined, his wife and nine year old son would be incredibly traumatized and ashamed for life. This is when John makes the decision to end his daughters life.

John uses the garrote to end JonBenets life- or at the least accelerate the death that was certainly coming after the serious head wound. After her death, he needs to come up with a plan. It is imperative that he diverts the attention anywhere but towards himself, which is why he stages a fake intrusion. But more on that later. For now, I’m going to focus on the ransom note.

The ransom note is, in my opinion, the most important piece of evidence in this crime. If you read the ransom note from the perspective of John writing it, preemptively explaining away the actions that he is already planning on doing on the next day, December the 26th, the letter makes perfect sense. It is my opinion that John did not intend to keep Jonbenets body in the house. I believe that he wanted to dump the body deep into the Colorado wilderness, where he hoped it would never be found. So upon killing her, why did he not just dump her body right then? It’s because at this late hour, he could not risk leaving the house. The noise of the garage door could potentially wake up Burke or Patsy- he already got lucky with them not hearing the scream and didn’t want to test his luck. Also remember that this was Christmas night – a night where many people have relatives flying in from all over and staying with them; people are opening champagne and getting merry and bright well into the night. It’s very possible that a neighbor would still be awake reveling and would see his car leaving at midnight- this would immediately raise a red flag when JonBenet is reported missing (which the family would have to eventually report). Also holidays are notorious for DUI arrests- cops will be on the prowl and John was a well known CEO in Boulder; it’s very possible his car would be recognized. He certainly can’t walk out the house with a body either, so he realizes that for the time being, he must remain put, and the body must remain in the house - for now. 

So what is he going to do? Assuming my theory that he wants to dump the body is true, he must get the body out of the house without Patsy calling the police, and without Pasty or anyone else noticing the body itself. That’s where the ransom note comes in. Not only is the ransom note going to point the direction away from him and to a nebulous ‘foreign faction’ and ‘group of individuals,’ but it’s also going to act as a step by step instruction on how to get rid of the body without calling the authorities and explaining his actions on the 26th that he’s already planning on enacting. 

I’m not going to reiterate the ransom note in its entirety, I’m sure everyone who is on this thread is more than familiar with it. But here are some things that stand out: 

- ‘Mr. Ramsey’

As we know, there was a draft that started with ‘Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey’ but it was not used. I believe that he intentionally decided to use his name alone so that he can act alone in this, so that he can dispose of the body alone. No, Patsy, I have to go alone. The note is addressed to me, not us.” He can also use this excuse when the police ask him why he went by himself.

- ‘We are a group of individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We do respect your bussiness [sic] but not the country that it serves.’

A very clever line because not only does it cast the shadow of suspicion away from him, it’s also incredibly vague language, which is intentional. Notice how every word is nebulous; ‘group’ could be three people, thirty, three hundred. ‘Foreign’ implies ‘not American’ which is…. Canadian? Saudi? Chilean? French? Japanese? And ‘faction’ is clever word as well. Faction could mean a government, a rebel army, a terrorist group, a branch of a military, literally so many things. 

John knows that it’s incredibly important to keep things as vague as possible. Even if he were to label a universally hated group such as, say, Isis, a quick scan of the CIA and FBIs extensive data bases would show that there probably was no evidence of Isis recruits in the state of Colorado. Even if he were to say “we are a group of Russian/ Chinese individuals” he knows they would have *something* to go on- but he cannot do that because he knows that if they were to get DNA and see that it’s not Asian, red flags would rise. He must keep this as vague as possible because if he narrows it down at all, then they can probably prove that it *wasn’t* the said culprit. 

- ‘You will withdraw $118,000.00 from your account.’ 

As we know, this was his Christmas bonus. He intentionally added this to widen the list of suspects. He is well aware that this would imply someone in his company, therefore again opening up the door to more people (ie, not him, perhaps a disgruntled employee possibly committing this crime. 

- ‘Make sure that you bring an adequate size attache to the bank.’ 

The addition of the suitcase in the ransom note is important because I believe that John was planning on stuffing her body in a suitcase to get her out of the house. It’s also a way to avoid Patsy seeing the body being brought to the car; additionally if anyone the next day happened to see him with a suitcase, or if the authorities asked why he had a suitcase/why one was missing from the house, he can point to the note and say, “the note told me to bring a big suitcase, so I grabbed one.” 

- ‘The delivery will be exhausting so I advise you to be rested.’

A line that many people find very odd, but not if you believe my theory: As I said, I believe that John was planning on putting her body into a suitcase and driving several hours deep into the Colorado wilderness, dumping her body, and then driving back. When Patsy, who is anxiously waiting at home, inevitably asks him why he was gone for several hours, or when the police ask him what he was doing for those unaccounted hours, he again can point to the note and explain his long absence on a long, complicated and exhausting delivery. I don’t think he really thought what he was going to actually say to them regarding the faux delivery, as in the finer details that would be asked of this delivery, but he probably thought that he would cross that bridge later. The most important thing for the time being was to get her body out of the house. 

- ‘If we monitor you getting the money early, we might call you early to arrange an earlier delivery of the money and hence a [sic] earlier delivery pick-up of your daughter.’

This line I believe was included to incite immediate action by both himself and Patsy the next morning. John knew that he needed to get moving the next morning- and fast. He had a dead body in his house, and he needed to get rid of it STAT. Not only is having a body in your house (where someone can possibly stumble upon it) very incriminating, it’s also import to note that cadaver dogs can start to detect bodies anywhere from 6 to 24 hours after death. Additionally, of course, a body will eventually start to decompose and smell. It is imperative that he hits the ground running and gets the body in the suitcase and out of the house as soon as possible. 

- ‘Any deviation of my instructions will result in the immediate execution of your daughter.’

- ‘Speaking to anyone about your situation, such as Police, F.B.I., etc., will result in your daughter being beheaded.’

I believe that these two lines were included in the ransom note to do two things: completely terrorize Patsy into absolute compliance, and so that John could point to the letter when the police ask him why he did not call the police immediately the morning of the 26th. He can brandish the note and say, “Officers, I know I should have alerted you, but I was absolutely terrified that my daughter would be beheaded. That’s why I didn’t call. Can you blame me?” 

- ‘Use that good southern common sense of yours.’

Again, casting the suspicion away toward ‘someone’ out there. We all know that while he lived in Atlanta, he wasn’t a born a bred Southern man. 

I also want to add that I believe that John wrote the note with his left hand and tried to slightly mimic Patsy’s handwriting. He did this, again, in order to draw the suspicion away from him and onto others- anyone else, including his own wife. The more people implicated, the more he can hide in the shadows. 

Of course I could be wrong, but this disposal or the body is genuinely what I believed John wanted to do the next day, December the 26th.And the note was absolutely vital in this step. Without the note, Patsy would’ve see JonBenets empty bed and immediately called the police. Without the note, he would not have an excuse as to why he was missing for hours when he was disposing the body, without the note and its implication of someone in the company and/or a foreign faction, this suspicion would’ve landed directly on him as the only adult male a the house that had zero evidence of an intruder. 

So you might be asking, why wouldn’t he right then put her in a suitcase and put her in the trunk of his car now? I believe that it would’ve been too risky. He’s a calculating man, and he knows that the plan could still get foiled (which it did, assuming my theory is correct) and if Pasty happened to wake up at any point in the night and check on the kids and saw that JonBenet was not in her bed, she would called the police without hesitation. If the police came to the house and it was discovered that his daughter was in his trunk, that would’ve been bad. His best bet was to start staging a phoney break in and partially hide the body. So he breaks the window, places the suitcase beneath it, and ties her hands and duct tapes her mouth for good measure, and he puts her in the wine cellar, where she probably wouldn’t be found, but if she was, it would look like a kidnapping attempt gone wrong. 

John knows it look better for him on the police report if Patsy finds the note, so he then places the note on the back staircase, which he knows Pasty goes down every morning to get her coffee. Also he gets in the shower at 5:45ish in the morning, which is strategic. I personally think that genuine shock is very hard to feign. Being in the shower with the steam and soap covering his face could hide his fraudulent shock. 

At this point, the plan gets foiled by Patsy. John was betting that Patsy would first read the letter and be absolutely too terrified to do anything but follow it in it’s entirety. But when Patsy stumbles upon the letter, scans it without reading it completely, dashes to JonBenets bedroom, she sees that she’s missing, and immediately falls into uncontrollable hysterics (understandably so) and calls the police without finishing the letter. John’s plan stops short. 

But this is why he intentionally finds her body first. He wants to contaminate the scene by removing her, removing the tape, etc. The rest is history. 

I would like to add some statements about the scream- many people find it hard to believe that you could not hear a child scream from the basement, but I assure you that this is true. With two insulated floors between the parents third floor suite and the basement, it’s plausible that patsy did not hear. I also want to talk about the pineapple… Perhaps John fed her pineapple prior to taking her into the basement, perhaps it was left on the counter and she took a piece or two at some point. I do not have a clear theory about the pineapple. 

I would also like to add why I started suspecting John, and that stems from an answer that he gave to Boulder Police when they were interviewing him. When asked to describe himself, he said, “I am, um… fairly passive. Not great with words. Decent work ethic, love my free time, love my family, and I am growing spiritually.” 

This answer to me, strangely enough, rang some of the largest alarm bells within me regarding the case. John was the CEO of billion dollar company. You do not become the CEO of $1 billion company that you started by being passive. He started the small company himself and grew it to an enormously successful corporation that was acquired by Lockheed Martin. A ‘passive’ man simply does not do that. Period. To describe himself as ‘passive’ is intentionally deceptive and a clear attempt to manipulate his image. He purposefully described himself in a very fraudulent manipulative way. He also was a very smart man, as I have said multiple times before, so to call himself ineloquent is also just not true. He is intentionally trying to paint a picture of himself that is not congruent with reality. It also was interesting to note that while Patsy was considered pretty religious, John was not. It’s suspiciously perfect timing that all the sudden he’s mentioning his Christian spirituality when his daughter was just found dead and he is a suspect. This interview made me realize that John was intentionally being very deceptive and manipulative in his police interview. 

After this, I started to look at his interviews a lot more closely. He intentionally bumbles his speech and gives vague, non-answers. In fact, he’s an absolute master at giving non-answers. He seems to always give very vague, wishy-washy responses where he says a lot doesn’t really say anything at the same time. 

After coming to the conclusion that he is a manipulative person who is trying to deceive both the police and the public, I took a step back from the case, and looked at it more clearly. It seems very simple to me now. We have a dead child who was sexually molested. We have an adult male, tatistically speaking the most likely to commit such a crime, who is deceitful and manipulative. We have lots of evidence that someone in the family committed the crime, and very few evidence that an intruder enter the house. We have a lot of indication that somebody was trying to muddy the waters and create as much chaos and confusion as possible, most likely to hide within said chaos and confusion. Without this obviously manufactured confusion to divert our attention and suspicion elsewhere, the light shines directly on John.

I was socially anxious my entire life until about 3 years ago I’ve been putting effort into my confidence and self esteem and social skills. I’m a lot better now and I’m pretty confident in myself and that I’m ready to date.

I was a late bloomer. I started my current job in 2021 and met a girl there I was absolutely infatuated with. She was the cause of my change towards bettering myself. Unfortunately I neglected asking her out due to self esteem, but we really got along at the workplace. Well she ended up with another dude and left the workplace. I knew it was best to let her go.

Anyways, I live in a rural area. Population 5k, and the nearest “big” city is an hour drive, and it’s still only population 40k. It’s a college town though.

I’m considering going to the bars there once I get my car fixed (it’s been broke down the last week).

I also joined a 5k run in town here, may or may not make friends there. It’s happening later this week.

I go to the gym daily, and go to a coffee shop once a week to write. Neither are promising locations to meet anyone. I go for hour-long walks at least three times a week. And then I take care of house chores (I do own my house), making my own dinners (time consuming, even though I meal prep one of my three meals and the third meal is actually a 1000 calories protein shake, it’s still a chunk of time out of my day, including dishes). On top of it all, I have a full time job. It’s good hours though, Friday-Sunday 12 hour days with an hour commute round trip.

So basically maintaining that normal lifestyle and also finding time to go out is quite a stretch, but I’ll do it.

I hear all of the stories about how dating gets difficult as you get older, and you can’t tell me it isn’t a real thing, everyone says the same thing.

A relationship is something I really want in life because, that type of bond is obviously deeper than friendship, it’s intimate both sexually and emotionally, it’s someone who cares about you, someone to talk to every day, someone to do things with, someone you know you have to stay motivated for. I don’t really know exactly what I want more than what I listed, or what to expect, but I certainly want to see what the fuss is about.

Second, the United States has gone downhill since we stop advertising cigarettes. If Joe Camel was still here, Donald Trump would not have become the president. That is a fact; not an opinion. 

Third, smoking cigarettes is cool. I love breathing in tobacco and tar in my lungs. In fact, it’s actually healthy for your lungs as your immune systems is always working against the foreign substances. 

Forth, if kids start smoking cigarettes, the education system would improve. It would greatly improve there attention span. Since we don’t believe that kids should have recess and we care more about punishing kids, we should allow them to smoke cigs in class. Maybe bring some weed and smoke some spliffs, you know to make that boring history class interesting (seriously tho who finds War of the Roses interesting, especially without weed and tobacco?) 

Fifth, this country has been straight up communist since we ban the advertising of ciggies. Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man represents more of the American dream than Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr and so on. It’s absolute freedom to mix tobacco and weed. It is absolute freedom to mix hash, tobacco, and crack cocaine and smoke it. I should be able to smoke that in public and in front of your kids. It would actually help your kids if I blow hash, tobacco, and crack cocaine smoke directly in their face (see point above) 

Sixth, RJ Reynolds, Philip Morris, Altria, ITG Brands and the other major tobacco companies in the US did nothing wrong. 

Seventh, Jesus smoked cigarettes and drank coffee after being crucified. Ask any Christian historian and they will tell you Jesus was smoking American Spirit and drinking Folgers coffee in his tomb while doing double deckers. 

Eighth, Donald Trump had one of the worst 100 days in office in modern US history. Why? Because he’s not hitting triple deckers, smoking cigarettes, and hitting the vape in the White House bathroom. You want to know why Kennedy, Eisenhower, LBJ, Nixon, and Reagan were great? They all smoked tobacco. 

Ninth, tobacco is all natural. 

And lastly, cigarettes makes me feel good stop fucking telling me to quit. “Oh we are worried about you” “oh you smoke 3 packs a day” “oh you are coughing up blood and tar” can you believe these liberals?

(long, part 2)","Not knowing there was a character limit I was forced to split this into two posts after I finished writing it out. So on to the second half of it. \[Part one got moderated, sorry\]

I walk outside and take out my phone, and decide to make some of the hardest calls I have ever made in my life. I call my Brother and Sister to tell them what is happening. My brothers phone goes to voice, so I left a msg. My sister answers and is in disbelief at first, but then tells me to stay with her and go in the van to the hospital with her and prepare her things. As that's happening, my brother texts me, having gotten the voicemail and tells me the same thing. One bit of relief, they both answered.

It is now roughly 5pm, and my mother is stable and in the ambulance, im with her, texting my siblings what is happening along the way. We get to the hospital and I wait, and wait, and wait. It is 8pm, and a doctor starts talking to me about everything that is wrong, and I only understood about half of it, and none of it sounds good. Carbon mon in the blood, severe buildup of water in the legs, technical terms that I didn't understand. Talking about not being able to take her to intensive care for fear of her not being able to handle the treatment. So on and so forth, despite all of that, I listened and wrote everything down.

I asked the doctor what I should do, and he explained that there is nothing I can do and that I should go and get some sleep and come back in the morning (it is now about 9-10pm). So I update my siblings on what's happening. I get home, my brother texts me saying he will come visit in the morning and pick me up on the way, I agree, set the alarm, and we both go to sleep. im unable to sleep. My phone rings at 11pm. It's the hospital, they explain to me that her condition is dropping and ask me to come down to the hospital as soon as possible.. im confused because they told me to go home, they explained that the situation has changed, and it's critical. I ask a straight question - is she dying? And he relents and says it's heading in that direction.

I get out of bed, take out my phone, my hand is shaking as I phone a taxi but I manage, i book the taxi, next I phone my brother and it was on do not disturb (ofcourse it was hed just gone to sleep, he couldnt have known) my sister answers and I tell her what the doctor said, she asks me if im sure, perhaps also in shock and I confirm as calmly as I can. She then said she is on her way, but it will take a while due to her being hours away. I head to the hospital.

Another surreal scene, I see my mother with wires and a breathing mask in one of the emergency rooms. She's not awake but breathing. My mind kind of goes blank, and all I can think to do is sit in a nearby chair and wait. Eventually, a doctor comes up to me to give more details about what is happening, but most of it goes over my head due to how tired I am. Eventually, my sister arrives at about 2am, she walks up to and hugs me, and we both cry for a bit, or a while. We eventually go back to see her, but before that, we go to a room where a difficult conversation between us and the staff happens. They explain to us that she does not have long and confirm it's terminal. They allow her to wake up.

My sister and I spend time with her, believing that we won't get another chance, we talk about the past, listen to some music, she still has her sense of humor; mentioning that she never thought she would meet so many firemen in her living room but at least thats off the bucket list. Thinking back, I'd like to thank those who let my family meet up and spend this time talking.

At about 6am my brother heard my voicemail and is on his way. We speak again to the staff, and they tell us that she has started to stabilise and improve to the point where she can be taken to a bed overnight, and that they are surprised by this turnaround. I find the time to have one last one-on-one conversation with her, I tell her that I kept my promise and that im here until the very end. She tells me that I have to make a new promise.

I ask her what that is, and she tells me to go and live your life, sort yourself out, promise me that you'll do that, and take some money out of my bank right now to tide you over. I make the promise. She tells me to reach out to my brother, and sister, and my brother's other half, whom I'll call 'Jane'. ''Jane is a good person who cares most about family, and you can rely on her. Promise me.'' I nod my head and say ok.

My brother arrives and we again spend time with her, at about 9am, they decide to take her to bed. It is at this point that my brother tells me to go home, try to get some sleep, and he will come pick me up at 6pm to go see her. I refuse at first, but then a little later I agree. I get home and try to sleep, at this point I have been awake for almost 24hours, but I simply can't sleep. My heart won't stop beating, and I have no idea what the feeling is; it's something I had never felt in my life, it wasn't until later when I spoke to Jane that I discovered what this feeling was(Anxiety).

Hours and hours passed by with the only company being the sound of my quickened heartbeats and the sound of it in my ear, unrelentingly keeping me away and not allowing me to calm down and rest. The severe stress must have put my body into some sort of strange survival mode that wouldn't allow me to turn off, a feeling that would accompany me for longer than just a day.

At some point, I fell asleep, but it wasn't for long, maybe a few hours. I woke up to the alarm I had set at 5pm, and I don't know why, but I screamed. Perhaps I realised upon waking that I was back in a nightmare rather than waking up from one. I text my brother and ask if he is coming, and he told me to get some more rest, we will go visit in the morning, as she is in a ward now, resting. me and your sister have been up for so long that we need some sleep right now. I say ok and decide to bathe and get some food since I had not eaten this whole time. At about 10pm I try to go to sleep again despite the strange feeling of being scared to go to sleep for some reason.

Of course, I am unable to sleep, but that didn't end up mattering. At half past midnight, my phone goes off, and it's the hospital. I am asked to come in as soon as possible and to contact my siblings, and am told that her turnaround had suddenly reversed and now she only has hours remaining. I am not proud of this, but I start to argue, in denial of what im being told, that they said this last time and she was fine, but after a couple of minutes I stop myself, apologise and say that I am on my way.

This time, both my sisters and brothers' phones don't pick up, unsurprisingly, they had fallen asleep after being awake for so long. I left answer phone messages telling them the situation and to come as soon as they could. As well as texting them. Another surreal scene as the taxi arrives at the hospital.

It's a strange thing. A large hospital at the dead of night with no people around. Empty and quiet, with an almost abandoned haunted feeling. Trying to find my way to the correct ward took some time, walking through corridors that felt like they could go on forever. I had nearly no sleep over the last 3 days, so im not surprised it took me so long to find my way. Then again, maybe I was procrastinating, part of me not wanting to continue this story. Eventually, I asked the few staff I could find for directions until I eventually found the doctor and nurses in charge of my mother. They led me to the room she was in. A dark, quiet room with only the sound of grating rhythmic beeps in the background, with three other patients occupying the room, no doubt trying to sleep despite these sounds.

And behind the curtain, my mother, looking awfully uncomfortable. She was not having a good time trying to breathe. I was not sure if she was awake or asleep, but she wouldn't respond to me. She simply lay there struggling to get comfortable. I tried to get her attention, but nothing worked, not until I held out my hand, which she grabbed tightly. Then I looked up and she was looking at me, and I could tell that she knew what was happening. I told her that I loved her, that I'd be ok, that she'd done so well to raise the three of us. She simply said 'ok' and let go of my hand. That was the last thing she said. An hour or so passed in this dark room, listening to struggling breath after breath, until, eventually, at 3am I heard one last breath.

I took out my phone, still updating my sister and brother, and told them that she had passed away. Then I left the room to tell the nurses, who then confirmed tod, and asked me to stay until my siblings could arrive. I agreed and told them that I was going outside for a bit. I don't remember too much of the next 5 hours after that, other than wandering around a dark hospital and smoking cig after cig outside. Wandering around, without a destination in mind. If I were to put a word on that feeling, it would probably be shock or devastation.

Lots of things ran through my mind. Not only at what had just happened, but also the future. I even considered ending it all that night. As far as I was concerned, I had no future, and my life was over. I had hidden away for the past decade to the point where I had let all of my ID's and cards expire. I didn't even receive post anymore. I had become completely invisible in that respect. So in my mind, I had convinced myself that it would be better to end it than to live in misery at some hostel or become homeless (which, thinking back, was an absurd train of thought, but I forgive myself for being so foolish at that time). Of course, this didn't happen, as im typing this right now.

Eventually, I returned to a waiting room, time passed, and at around 7am I was handed pamphlets about bereavement, funerals, and such things that at the time I did not and could not look at. I had reached my limit. I had been awake for so long, and my eyes and head were hurting. At around the same time, my sister calls me apologising profusely and saying she is on her way, I can't hold it in anymore and start crying and telling her I can't take anymore of this and I just want to go home. She tells me to go home and sleep, and that she and my brother will take over. I don't remember much of what happened after that, I think I cried until falling asleep and woke up some time in the afternoon after a phone call from my brother and sister visiting the flat to sort out the aftermath of paperwork and such.

Bereavement was a word I had never heard until recently, an experience that was new to me. I don't agree with what people call the 5 stages of grief. There was an article that spoke to me on a personal level that renamed those stages into Devastation, Avoidance, What if?, Overwhelmed and Healing.

I certainly experienced Devastation that night at the hospital, wandering the wards. Instead of getting angry, I distracted myself by getting busy afterwards, you could call that Avoidance. I never bargained; I knew there was no point, but I constantly questioned if I could have done things differently or sooner to change the outcome, 'what if' isms that became pointless to think about.

I didn't get depressed, instead, I needed help from my siblings, friends, and social workers because everything that was happening around me was too much, and I was overwhelmed. I wanted to sort things out, but I needed a helping hand. After that, well, im not there yet in this ramblingly long story.

So, later that afternoon, my brother and sister visited.

Things were pretty bad. The ugly past that I avoided talking about until now had caught up to me, and it was time to confess and ask for help. I made a promise. I confessed everything to my brother and sister. I spared no details and told them nothing but the truth of everything that had happened above, which neither me or my mother had properly reached out for help from family on. (one of my biggest regrets).

I told them that im scared to face the world. I don't trust people anymore. I don't know how to be an adult anymore. I need help. I'm scared, and scared of what will happen to me. I told them everything. Including the fact that I have never even used a smartphone for anything other than calls.

Of course, they were shocked, and I was expecting all sorts of insults and awfulness. I felt like I deserved as much for being such a failure of a person, but it never came.

First, they said that over the last 2-3 days that I had done well, and that I did well caring for mum. You were there, and that's what's important. Second, they said that we will help you, but we won't hold your hand; it's time for you to sort yourself out, we can't do that for you, only you can do that. I'll never forget the look my sister gave me, in particular, she looked me dead in the eyes and asked me if im going to sort myself out and work again, a challenging gaze. I almost shouted out my yes.

\[That's when it happened, things could have gone one of two ways, and you can imagine the worst way, but something lit up inside of me when she asked me that question, a long forgotten fire that I forgot existed within myself.\]

The same day after my siblings visited, I set off to fix my life with the help of my siblings and people around me. I had enough of the self-loathing, enough of the misery, I was sick of it and angry at myself. The first thing I did was the paperwork to renew my passport and ID. Those were going to take at least a week to process, and without them, I can't do anything else, such as get a bank account. I also got into contact with Jane my brothers other half and ask her for help in terms of getting social care since she had been through the same situation as me once before.

Still, despite being without sleep, and got one of the worst portraits I have ever taken of myself looking like some sleep-deprived convict. Thankfully, I still had some paperwork, like my birth certificate. I was able to send off for my provisional licence and passport that same day by going to town, getting a lift from my brother.

We were not sure if it was going to work because I had no proof of address (unbelievable, I know) due to essentially living in the flat as a ghost for nearly a decade. Never claiming a thing from the government, and my mother never informed anyone officially that I lived there. Basically, I didn't exist, so in turn it was hard to get documents to prove that I did exist. Fortunately, everything went fine, and my brother was happy that I had finally started to take steps to sort things out and said he and Jane would pick me up tomorrow to sort the social side.

We set off to a big centre that helps with people who are in trouble, and despite my pride taking a hit, I patiently went through the process with Jane speaking for me and helping me through it. She had filled out the entire application process on my behalf overnight, and all on my behalf, for me to start getting support from the government. As well as getting me social support due to me going through a combination of bereavement, depression and anxiety issues.

I don't know how she did so much in such a short space of time, but she did it because I was in such a mess that I was incapable of doing it myself. Despite not having a bank account, they agreed to wait for me to get one after I received my ID's, and to let me update it later. She had even gotten them to hand me a food bank voucher just to tide me over until things got sorted out. She did many other things the following week. Needless to say, I was eternally grateful, and I of course thanked her a number of times.

The same day, after they dropped me off. I sent in an application to join the GP surgery near me in order to start getting help and doctors' notes on my condition, and find out anything else that might be wrong physically or mentally with me. Turns out after some tests I was alright, other than a vitamin deficiency which has been sorted out.

The day after that, I met the social worker who manages the houses around the area, another difficult conversation. I obviously could not stay in a 2-bedroom flat, so at the time, my prospects were grim since I was a single male of working age, so not high on the priority list compared to families with children. I was expecting to be expelled and forced to stay at hostels. Again, I had to confess everything that happened, including my history. In order to let them decide what to do with me.

The social worker, whom I will call 'Anne' listened quietly, letting me finish the story. Before explaining that in all likelihood I can't stay at this flat since it would not make sense logically, that said, we don't want to see people go homeless, so I will head back to the office and see what can be done, but I can't promise anything. I had to wait and see. I didn't know how long that would take. Turns out it was only a few hours, she had come back pretty quickly.

Anne explained to me that my case was very unusual and unique, but considering the extent of what I have been going through, she did not want to see me go homeless in such a vulnerable condition. She had found out that there was in fact a 1-bedroom flat in the same block that I live in being renovated, and that she plans to have me move in there, and a family will move into this flat. Proof of address was an issue, but fortunately, she had seen me enough over the past years.

I was in disbelief, a stroke of unbelievable luck. I wasn't even sure I was going to have a place to live, let alone a place straight away and even in the same block. I didn't know what to say, eventually I just said 'I could hug you' and she smiled and said Sure, go ahead, I was in tears. I couldn't believe it.

That same day, I decided to make some phone calls to my best friend whom I had been out of contact with for a very long time. It was good speaking to them again and getting some things off my chest. I also spoke to another best friend of mine,  the same kind of conversation, but I also asked them if I could volunteer at the place they worked. I broke the good news to my siblings who were overjoyed and Jane who was 'made up' which I later learned meant happy. It was the first good day in what felt like a long time.

I changed my habits from completely no structure to routines and order. Up at the same time in the morning, asleep at the same time at night, and normal self-care every day. I started taking care of the person I had never bothered taking care of for many years, myself.

I then went to work clearing out the flat, and giving myself a bit of time to grieve, I had been given a month to prepare. It was difficult. It was always the first time I did anything that was the hardest. Like making food then realising that I cooked for mum as well, but she's not there anymore, or waking up in the morning and not hearing her ask for coffee. Things like that. But I got it out of my system, gave myself time to cry, and heal.

Throwing out things and donating to charities was also pretty rough. Spending entire days phoning companies to inform them of my mother's passing was a strange experience, never in such a short period of time had I heard so many 'im sorry for you loss'es. Bit of advice, don't tell anyone grieving that you are sorry for their loss, they've probably heard it way too many times by now. Just tell them I'm here for you if you need it' if you are friend/family, or don't say anything and simply listen if it's work related.

Meanwhile, im getting help from social workers, weekly visits planned. As well as from the gov in general. Most of my time is spent sorting out paperwork and getting back in touch with society (and learning how to use a smartphone properly).

Sometime at the end of this week, I start receiving things through the post, giving me proof of address, and id's and such. Allowing me to start a bank account via my smartphone, which was a surreal experience for someone who never uses them, but it went through without a hitch. All of a sudden, im starting to exist again.

I decided to grab all the tobacco and smoking products, put them in a bag and throw them down the bin shoot. Good riddance, I didn't care how difficult the following weeks were going to be in terms of nicotine withdrawal. After watching the way my mother died, with smoking being one of the main causes, that was as good a motivation as any to quit smoking. The difficulty of quitting will pass (and it did pass).

I finish clearing most of the flat out by the end of the week, and on Monday, about a week after my mother's death. I get a second visit from the social housing people. They help me out with the process of bills and setting up direct debits and such. Things are starting to come together and click into place, putting some order into the storm, but it's a long road from here.

The next couple of weeks are a combination of me packing, sorting out medical and social appointments, and paperwork. Going through a volunteer application process. Preparing to move in a few weeks. I start going out for walks, sign up for a gym and start getting my health in order. Start a diet supported by my ability to cook that I learned over the past months.

My brother, perhaps because of seeing the effort, asks me, 'Why don't you get a driving licence?' I explain that at the moment I can't afford a car or driving lessons, but I could get a motorbike. He says to me 'pass your theory and ill pay for your driving lessons, you know what screw it, pass your test and ill buy you a car'. He reasoned that a car would be more practical and give me more options.

Shocked, I can only reply that if he puts it that way, I will start studying for the theory test right away. I wasn't quite sure how to react, at first I thought he was joking, but I cracked on.

My life for the next couple of weeks are a combination of studying for my driving theory, moving house, dealing with bereavement paperwork, visiting social workers, visiting doctors, going to the gym, and learning how to 'adult' again.

You would think all of this happening would be too much for somebody who spent almost 10 years hiding away in depression, and the me before those nights at the hospital would have agreed. However, I felt like I left a dark part of me behind at that place and buried it. I started feeling happy to be doing stuff again, it wasn't hard, it was enjoyable. I was out and about doing something, being a person again.

Each visit to my GP was met with 'you are looking better every time I see you', and each visit to social workers also received the same kind of reply. I was never sure how to respond to it other than a smile and a shy thanks, I always get awkward with compliments since im not used to getting them.

Every month, due to eating healthy, taking care of myself well, and going to the gym gave me energy again. Going to do volunteer work and generally being busy most days meant I was losing about 0.5-1kg every week. Before I started losing weight, I was 114kg's Today im 98kg's. Though I did get some injuries along the way.

After studying the theory test for a few weeks, I went and sit the test, passed it, and sent the good news to my brother. He was happy and booked me my first driving lesson, which became a regular addition to my suddenly packed calendar. With Monday and Friday lessons.

My sister helped me buy furniture for the move, helping me purchase a new mattress and such and said I can pay it back later. My siblings also deal with the funeral arrangements since I didn't have the heart to get that particular part of the paperwork sorted out. I was thankful to her for sorting it out.

I moved into the new flat in November, a month after my mother's passing. To a new home, a fresh start and another chance. I left a voice message to the social worker who helped me move here, telling them how I was doing and how thankful I was for all the help they gave me in the past month.

The most difficult month (perhaps even years) of my life had passed, and somehow I had gotten out of it in a way I never expected or could have predicted. After settling down and getting into a routine of driving lessons, fitness at the gym, sorting out the new flat, and doing volunteer work, as well as managing 'adult stuff'. I finally reached a stability I had been longing for not just for the past month, but likely for a whole decade.

A steady line of improvement followed in the months later, driving lessons were always nerve-wracking, but deep down I enjoyed them quite a lot. I get along really well with the manager at the place I volunteer at, to the point where recently I have been offered a job there.

This journey was not without a few roadblocks. Only 3 days before my test, my instructor's car broke down with a catastrophic cooling failure. What are the chances? But this time, I did not let setbacks like this get to me; I stayed calm and we worked through what we were going to do about it. He cancelled my Friday lesson and instead I'd be driving a courtesy car, and he'd give me a free lesson on Sunday, the day before the test. Fortunately, it wasn't a completely different car and the same model, so not too bad. Somehow, by some stroke of crazy bad luck, the courtesy car also breaks down, but it's just a flat tyre, and we would still be setting the test tomorrow.

My nerves were shot at the test due to the recent drama with the instructor's car, but somehow I got through it and passed first time with a moderate amount of faults, but all were negligible faults. Despite what happened, at least it's a story to tell, and I even passed after it all. This was back in March this year, im a bit late getting a full driving licence at 34 years of age, but better late than never. I have a quiet birthday sometime in the same month, and I don't make much fuss over it (still never am one for birthdays).

Of course, my brother was very happy that id passed first time (and so was I after learning the horror stories of people that had failed 5+ times and lost so much money doing so), and as promised we are now working out a car and hes saving up while I work out things like insurance and such. He had ended up paying for half of my lessons, which helped a great deal; I would not have been able to afford all of them (my mother and I did not have much in the way of savings). Especially since I had recently returned my sister's money to her for helping me with furniture, and settled that.

Despite all that he has done, he has even offered me some work with him if I havent found work yet (he had been running his own company for the past 15years) I explained that I was more than happy to but he didnt need to pay me and id help him for free, at least until I learned how to do everything properly.

I also explained that I'd never asked him about working with him before since it'd feel like I'd be asking him for even more money, and I didn't want to come off as rude, which he had a little laugh at.

So we're getting close to the present, and the end stages of this post, which I had no intention of making as long as I did, but it happened, and here we are.

I now have multiple job prospects, one with my efforts from volunteering, which I have been doing for about 5-6 months now, and the other is a future prospect with my brother's company. My CV is back up to date, and despite what happened back at Uni, I was still awarded a Diploma, so it's something to be proud of.

My health has improved greatly, and I have been smoke-free for almost half a year. I have lost about 15kg, despite some gym injuries in the process. I regularly go to any appointments needed, or volunteer work, or gym, shopping, etc. I am living a pretty normal, healthy life.

I've become very competent at managing my finances and at cooking and eating healthily, and it's paying off. Not only in health, but keeping my living costs down. I returned to my old hobby of Gaming, but this time not going overboard. Everything in moderation.

I will be driving soon. I don't know if my driving can be considered good or not, but let's hope I don't crash in the first year. Not sure what car I'll get, it might even be a Van, who knows. I got in touch with old friends and made some new ones at the gym and at work. My brother's other half, whom I think I nicknamed Jane is trying to get me to adopt one of her kittens, which might be nice, but im still thinking about that one.

I'm 35, and sure im getting on a bit now, but I don't feel my age at all. I feel like I pressed the pause button on my life for about 10 years and had only pressed play again half a year ago, so I will pretend that im pressing play from when I was 25 and on the way to starting my life properly again. Which is some weird form of copium I know, but im going to roll with it.

I miss my mum, of course I do, but I feel like I went through the process of healing as best as I could. The most important thing was that I held every promise I made, I reached out for help, sorted my life out, and gave it another go. I can honestly say I am much happier for it, I feel like I have prospects and options open to me again. I feel good about myself and proud of who I am again.

Would I change anything if I had the option to? honestly? Yes, I know the normal and cliche thing would be to say 'I wouldn't change a thing', but seriously, I would change things. Like getting my mother help sooner instead of trying to wing it on my own. Fixing my life sooner and staying healthy. Not putting trust into the wrong people or places. Not being such a 'yes man' to everybody when I was younger, because it lead to people taking advantage.

Things like that. However, I will say the cliche one, while I would change things, I don't regret the paths that I took, and double cliche: because it made me who I am today, and im proud of that.

Advice to others? Hopefully, there are things in here that will help you make better decisions in your life, and nothing would give me more joy than to see that something I have done has helped somebody else avoid some of those mistakes or better prepare for storms. Don't be afraid to trust people, even if in the past you have been let down,. Do not stop, don't underestimate time's never-ending march, make the most of what you have.

As for the moral of my story? Well, mine's not over yet. I just hope something I said here might speak to somebody out there, or maybe it's all just drivel? But seriously, if you are in trouble and lamenting how difficult life is. Reach your hand out and ask for help, no matter how daunting that prospect feels. If nobody knows, how can they help? People won't be able to do everything for you, but all you need is a way to help yourself, and the rest will come.

Who knows what will happen? I plan to run a half-marathon near the end of this year (if I can lose enough weight and get fit enough). This time im excited about the future and not scared. I can't wait for what's going to happen next. If you read this whole thing, thank you for being here.",1,1745191925.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.67,False

1k3zdf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1k3zdf1/dating_in_college_has_been_kind_of_rough/,Dating in college has been kind of rough,"**Sorry for the essay here.** 

I've always known I've wanted a relationship and right now I'm about to graduate with my bachelors and head to grad school. I know people are looking to build their career and everything but I also think there is room to make relationships that could potentially develop and that just has not worked out for me. 

My freshman and sophomore year I did go on dates with at least 5 different girls. Only one of the girls led to a second date (we hung out a total of 5 times in the month of July before my sophomore year started) and looked like things were going to develop but when college started back up she called it off. I am glad she at least communicated that with me but it was disappointing nonetheless. I tried dating a bit more later into my sophomore year, but no real results came from it (as I said that one girl was the only one that led to a second date). Keep in mind there were also girls that I just was not interested in either, so there's that. 

I did not date at all my junior year because I was doing a ton of work to build my resume and obtain an internship. I would not try again until recently in the last semester of my senior year which is where I asked a girl out who was apart of one of the organizations I'm apart of. We were more acquaintances beforehand but I had a crush on her and we never really had bad conversations. 

She agreed to a coffee date. It went well. She agreed to a second date. It went well, and at the end of it she asked if I wanted a hug and then she told me to drive home to safe and yadada. Definitely some better results I had seen in awhile. These dates happened about a month ago and the week before our spring break started. The communication via text dwindled during it but I'll give myself and her slack because it was spring break after all. I did notice some bad signs where I asked her if she wanted to hang out on a Sunday and she didn't respond for two days saying she was busy and was available later in the week. I told her to let me know when what day was good for her to where I got radio silence for another two days. 

When it got to the middle of the week I was like ""ight ill just organize it myself"". And texted her and got it going, blah blah blah, we went on the third date, it went well, we made out at the end of it. Then the next day we met up at the bars downtown in the college town and, blah blah blah, it went well, we both got drunk, I walked her home, we held hands, we made out outside her apartment, told me to get home safe. 

But the following week is where things kind of looked like red flags. Keep in mind she DID mention she was really busy that week, but I mean come on. It's not that hard to respond to a text with a sentence or two. 

I asked her if she was free on a day. No response for two days, I had to double text her; she said she had a lot on her plate, couldn't do it. Next I asked her if she was still willing to go to our organizations formal with me (She did say she would go with me prior). She said she wasn't going to go. As a recap, we went on two dates, then over spring break there was a point she didn't respond to me for two days, then didn't let me know a day she was free after telling her to let me know, then didn't respond to my question if she was free on a day for like three days, then said she didn't want to go to formal with me after she said she would prior. So I think those are signs of disinterest? No? So yeah I just stopped talking to her. I think she just needs space. But idk, I have anxiety issues so maybe it was good for me too. 

Anyways FORMAL NIGHT!!! I get really drunk, didn't have plans to talk to a girl, just get drunk. But then I talked to a girl at formal (who was friends with one of the members). We hit it off, we danced together, we held hands, the conservations were horrible (bc we were both hammered), but nevertheless, I walked her home, we exchanged numbers. I texted her, she responded, we went on a date later in week. The date was great, great conversation (bc we were not hammered). A few days later, we went on a second date, the date was great, we made out at the end. 

But now, I realized that date I was feeling a bit off, because then the next day I woke up atrociously sick. So I let her know I got sick and told her I hope she doesn't get sick either. But then the same thing happened with the last girl. No response for days. She did respond and said ""Hey thanks for letting me know, I hope you're feelings better, I've been so so busy with class projects"" so I say the next day ""You're good what class projects are you working on?"" And yeah I haven't gotten a response in like 3 days.  

So yeah idk. I'm getting mixed signals. It might not be that big of a deal, but then again, I have anxiety. Don't know if I'm doing anything wrong, don't know if they were not interested, but it definitely seemed like they all were. Dunno if they are just busy, but that is what it is. Frankly I've just gotten exhausted from overthinking it so I'm just going to branch out, get my schoolwork done, enjoy my summer, make some money, then prepare for my career in grad school. 

Any advice would be great. ",2,1745191386.0,dating,4,1.0,False
1k3zcgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PureLuxy/comments/1k3zcgi/scandinavian_furniture_timeless_elegance_meets/,Scandinavian Furniture: Timeless Elegance Meets Modern Functionality,"Scandinavian furniture, with its **minimalist charm**, **functional design**, and **timeless aesthetics**, has taken the world of interior decor by storm. Rooted in the traditions of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, Scandinavian design emphasizes simplicity, utility, and beauty. It is no wonder that these principles have transformed how we perceive living spaces across the globe.

# Origins and History of Scandinavian Design

The origins of [Scandinavian furniture](https://pureluxy.com/scandinavian-furniture/) trace back to the early 20th century, evolving through the 1930s and blossoming in the 1950s. The movement was a response to the over-ornamentation of previous eras, pushing for **clean lines**, **affordable materials**, and **accessible design**. Legendary designers like **Arne Jacobsen**, **Hans Wegner**, and **Alvar Aalto** brought international attention to the Nordic design ethos, which favored harmony with nature and user-centric functionality.

# Key Characteristics of Scandinavian Furniture

# 1. Minimalism with Purpose

Scandinavian furniture is defined by its **uncluttered aesthetic**. Every element is intentional. From **sleek wooden tables** to **streamlined chairs**, the focus is on eliminating excess. This design approach fosters calm, promotes clarity, and creates a serene atmosphere in any home.

# 2. Light and Natural Materials

Nordic designers frequently use **light-colored woods** such as **pine**, **beech**, and **ash**, which not only bring warmth but also reflect the limited natural light of the northern climates. Coupled with **natural textiles** like wool, linen, and leather, Scandinavian furniture adds a soft, organic touch to interiors.

# 3. Function Over Form

The principle of “form follows function” is at the heart of Scandinavian design. Each piece is crafted to **enhance everyday life** — whether it’s a chair designed for ergonomic support or a modular shelf offering flexible storage. **Multifunctional furniture** is a staple, especially in smaller urban homes.

# 4. Muted, Neutral Color Palettes

The Scandinavian palette often features **whites**, **grays**, **beiges**, and **earthy tones**, promoting a clean and airy environment. Accents of **pastel blues**, **forest greens**, and **charcoal blacks** are also used to complement and balance the aesthetic.

# Scandinavian Furniture for Every Room

# Living Room

The Scandinavian living room is the epitome of comfort and clarity. Think **low-profile sofas**, **mid-century coffee tables**, and **textured rugs** layered over wooden floors. Signature pieces like the **Eames Lounge Chair** or **Finn Juhl’s Poet Sofa** are iconic examples of functionality meeting elegance.

# Bedroom

In a Scandinavian bedroom, the focus is on **restorative calm**. Clean-lined **platform beds**, **floating nightstands**, and **under-bed storage** solutions ensure a clutter-free space. Soft hues, natural linens, and minimal decor contribute to a **soothing retreat**.

# Dining Room

Scandinavian dining rooms champion **communal living**. Large **wooden tables**, **simple dining chairs**, and **ambient lighting** — such as pendant lamps in matte finishes — create inviting spaces. Pieces like **Hans Wegner’s Wishbone Chair** or **Carl Hansen tables** elevate the dining experience with their refined craftsmanship.

# Home Office

With remote work on the rise, the home office demands functionality. Scandinavian desks are designed with **ergonomic support**, **ample surface space**, and **integrated storage**. Pairing them with a **comfortable task chair** and minimal accessories leads to improved focus and productivity.

# Popular Scandinavian Furniture Brands

# IKEA

Arguably the most well-known ambassador of Scandinavian design, **IKEA** offers affordable, minimalist furniture that embodies the core values of the movement. Flat-pack innovation and versatile design have made IKEA a household name globally.

# Muuto

Muuto represents [**new Nordic design**](https://pureluxy.com/scandinavian-furniture/), collaborating with contemporary designers to reinterpret traditional forms. Their pieces are known for **bold silhouettes**, **innovative materials**, and **functional enhancements**.

# Hay

Hay merges **Danish design traditions** with **cutting-edge technology**. Their furniture often incorporates industrial influences while maintaining the **softness and approachability** of Scandinavian aesthetics.

# Ferm Living

Ferm Living combines **classic Scandinavian principles** with **modern lifestyle needs**, offering **sustainable furniture** and **home accessories**. The brand stands out for its **organic shapes**, **calming colors**, and **ethical production values**.

# Why Scandinavian Furniture Remains in Demand

# Timeless Appeal

Unlike fleeting trends, Scandinavian furniture remains perennially stylish. Its **understated elegance** allows it to blend seamlessly into various design themes — from modernist lofts to cozy cottages.

# Sustainability

Scandinavian countries prioritize **eco-conscious production**, with many brands emphasizing **sustainable forestry**, **recyclable materials**, and **ethical manufacturing practices**. This aligns with the growing global movement toward **responsible consumerism**.

# Ease of Customization

Due to its **neutral base**, Scandinavian furniture can easily be personalized. Whether through vibrant cushions, statement artwork, or natural plants, homeowners can inject their own personality without overpowering the space.

# Space Optimization

Urban dwellers often turn to Scandinavian furniture for its **space-saving capabilities**. From **modular shelving units** to **nesting tables**, the design ethos supports functionality in even the smallest of areas.

# How to Style a Scandinavian-Inspired Home

* **Start with a neutral base**: Use white or light gray walls as a backdrop.
* **Incorporate natural textures**: Wood, wool, and stone should be visible throughout.
* **Layer with lighting**: Use layered lighting — pendants, floor lamps, and candles — to create ambiance.
* **Add cozy elements**: Throws, cushions, and rugs soften the look and enhance comfort.
* **Minimize clutter**: Choose functional decor and store unnecessary items out of sight.
* **Choose statement pieces wisely**: One or two designer pieces can anchor the room without overwhelming it.

# Where to Buy Authentic Scandinavian Furniture

[Authentic Scandinavian furniture](https://pureluxy.com/scandinavian-furniture/) is available both online and through showrooms. Reputable retailers include:

* **Design Within Reach**
* **Finnish Design Shop**
* **Scandinavian Designs**
* **2Modern**
* **TRNK NYC**

Additionally, **vintage stores** and **auctions** often feature rare mid-century Scandinavian pieces for collectors and enthusiasts.

# Conclusion

Scandinavian furniture isn’t just a design style — it’s a philosophy rooted in **simplicity**, **intentionality**, and **human connection**. Whether you’re redesigning a single room or curating a whole house, embracing Scandinavian design promises a space that is both **functional and beautiful**, **timeless yet contemporary**.

It was dark, Paul checked his watch ‘21:24’ it read, he’d been on the bus for about 15 minutes. he was tired, and knowing he would have to move again in a short time put a tentative frown on his face even though it was just down a flight of stairs it felt like such a task getting off the bus. He chose to sit at the back of a double decker in hindsight he was unsure why he was even sat there, he has a constant uncertainty in his life often unsure what he’s doing or how to feel, the loud rumbling of the engine just centimetres below him and the general noise of the fellow commuters of the bus felt loud and abrasive, a noise his headphones couldn’t drown out. 

A notification of low battery popped up on his phone, he rummaged through his bag to find his charger, a half eaten pack of chewing gum and a box labeled ‘Sertraline’ looked back at him. The brail on the box reflected off the flouresant light of the bus. he’d been given it several months earlier after his mum advised him to go see a doctor, you’re a student, it’s free! She suggested. 

he hadn’t taken his medication today or yesterday in fact not out of any defiance or moral objection that he shouldn’t be on them he actually thought that his mum and doctor were right but he’s convinced himself he just forgets even though this isn’t true, He knows this and subconsciously prides himself on his memory, it’s one of the only thing he believes well about himself, just the thought of pouring himself a glass of water and physically taking the pills feels exhausting, a mountain to climb like clambering out of bed and taking the walk down stairs wouldn’t be worth it. Would life be any better if I go down stairs and do something productive. Probably not he thought. 

It was just weeks after his 18th birthday, ‘your life starts now’ he kept repeating to himself in his mind, the same words his grandmother told him in the text he received from her on his birthday his friends joked to him about how ‘it only goes down hill from here’ although it was meant in a light hearted way those words dawned on him and felt like a heavy weight pinning him down and made everything feel like a gruelling task he has to overcome. He suddenly snapped out of the trance his own consciousness had put him in he wasn’t sure how long he’d been day dreaming for but he mustered up the strength to get off the bus, he thanked the driver and set off. it was early spring but at this time of night it was still cold the breeze hit his face and stung his ears, sniffling, he wipes his nose with the back of his hand, ‘Kellaway Road’ the familiar street sign infront of him read, a 5 minute walk back to his house, he’d left his coat when he left the house earlier in the day the wind rippled through his jumper the chill tensed his core and made him shudder.

 By the time he’s arrived back to his house the sky was nothing but a thick black cloud above his head not a star insight, the dimly lit street lights and the bleak grey concrete below were the only thing visible. The door was locked and nothing but a single lamp on through the living room window, it was giving the front of his house a warm orange glow, His mum was already asleep when he arrived back at the house, In the kitchen was a plate wrapped in tinfoil. A ‘post it note’ with ‘dinner’ written on it on the top Paul often missed dinner, it was usually his one meal of the day, if he wasn’t out he was in his room and ignored his mothers shouts, not being hungry from his appetite being suppressed due to cigarettes and coffee he put the plate in the fridge and went to sleep.",1,1745191128.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

**Magical Delicacy**

**Ooblets**

**Wylde Flower**  
I KNOW! I'm sorry! I tried like 3 times to start a game and never go past the first spring. I love the characters, the town, the vibe. No character customisation is annoying and I HATE the color red so being in a red dress is meh. But it's more the fact that it's so slooooooow. Finishing any quests takes dayyyys because you're always waiting after something. It's weird because I don't mind in SV.

**Bugsnax**  
Probably the one I played the most on this list but one day I had enough. I don't remember anything about it.

**My time at Potia**  
I know everyone loves this series but I just couldn't get into it. There's a little too much combat for my taste (I'm so bad at it and it stresses me out), I hated the mines and there was so much steps to craft the most basic thing. Plus I was on the switch which apparently is way worse than on pc. Giving this one a second chance, I'd play on Steam Deck.

**Cat Quest 1**  
I know I said I was bad at combat, I am, but although it was a little challenging it didn't seem too bad in Cat Quest. But I don't know, I found the game very repetitive with no real reason to keep playing.

I’m in a tough spot and would really appreciate any insight or shared experiences.

My ex (Freya) and I were together for nearly 8 years. We had a warm, adventurous, and deeply connected relationship. It honestly felt like we were soulmates — playful, vulnerable, and real. We were also very involved with each other’s kids. My children saw her as a second mom, and I had a strong bond with her son and daughter too.

Six months ago, things fell apart. Her daughter (Lore) no longer wanted to live with us after a conflict, and Freya moved out — into a caravan, temporarily. Since then, she hasn’t reconnected with Lore, hasn’t rented a place, and hasn’t built any kind of new life. Everything feels frozen in time.

At first, things were cold and distant. But in the past 5 weeks, something shifted. She started watching my Facebook stories again — to be clear: she never really stopped. She blocked me on Instagram, but Facebook stayed open, and she’s been watching anonymously ever since. She sent warm messages, laughed at my jokes, and even let her son (Lucas) reach out to me again. She liked posts from my sister, re-entered my world in small but meaningful ways.

One moment stood out: a few weeks ago she came by to pick up some of her things. I could’ve dropped them off at her parents’ place — but she chose to come herself. And then… she stayed for over an hour, just drinking coffee. No tension, just a calm, familiar presence.

About a week ago, I stopped initiating contact — not out of anger, but self-respect. Since then, she’s gone quiet too. And that silence is messing with me. Some days I think: maybe she needs this time to realize what’s still there. Other days I worry I misread everything.

My friends believe it’s long over. But I feel something else. She hasn’t moved on, hasn’t rebuilt her life, and still quietly stays close.

My question:
Has anyone experienced this before?
Can this kind of silent closeness still lead to reconciliation?
Or am I clinging to something that no longer exists?",1,1745190814.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/ogCNVId)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

1k3z1w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1k3z1w9/a_few_alkemia_perfumes_review/,A Few Alkemia Perfumes review,"I have come here to absolutely *gush* over my latest Alkemia order.   
To preface, I will say that my tastes are very flexible, and I buy perfumes to help in writing and art - as inspiration, with specific notes always tied to specific characters. (If anyone's curious, I've got V - cherries and spice; S - temple incense and vanilla; A - spiced pears and florals; M - roses, opium, and tea.)

1. *Cherries of the Night - A very naughty flirtation of black cherries exquisitely bathed in Maraschino liqueur, cherry amber, musky black amber, dark spiced rum, warm nutmeg, and Peru balsam.*  
I've read about this perfume when searching for, well, cherries. Ordered 2x sample and boy, did it not disappoint me in the slightest. Out of the bottle, it smells bitter, almost like over-ripe cherries. The first whiff of my skin caught me a bit off-guard - the note had a strong sour tinge to it! Over several hours, it settled into a soft, warm, sweet cherry scent with a bit of that bitterness i smelled from the bottle. This perfume has absolutely *monstrous* strength - my whole room smelled of it after a while - and longevity on my skin - I could smell it up to 24-25 hours after using it, and I didn't slather. (Yet.) 10/10, everything in me is screaming to break the scale and give it a higher rating, will be getting a bigger bottle.

2. *Ecstasies of Light - The lustrous glow of white amber infused with pear blossoms, white figs, bergamot, gorse flowers, winter honeysuckle, and osmanthus.*  
This one, I'll admit, I chose largely based on its title. Out of the bottle, it has a fresh, light scent - I think I could smell the figs the most? On laydown, forgive my associations, it shone - like a ray of sunlight. After a bit, after drying down, the gorse flowers and pear blossoms took over, with bergamot giving it an amazing grounding undertone. Its longevity was amazing - the last to go was a faint floral smell (can't quite place whether it was the gorse flowers or the osmanthus :c ), after around 13 hours. 10/10.

3. *Smoke & Mirrors. An elusive, smokey blend of burning wood, Madagascar Vanilla, and Tonka. We find this one to be elementally simple, but unusually mercurial and highly responsive to different skin chemistries… the vanilla and the smoke dance with each other almost continuously… sometimes the foreground is smoky, then sweet, then returns with sweetly smoky, then smoky.*  
This is an extremely fun perfume - I got it thinking it'd be inspiration for a vanilla/incense/smoke character, but it ended up smelling of burning wood. Exclusively burning wood. It was very strong, a bitterness to it that crawled all the way into my throat in a pleasant way - only after about \~7 hours did I begin to notice the notes of vanilla and finally, right before it vanished (\~11 hours), I could scent the tonka. Amazing perfume, the gamble of which note would take to my skin the most was so much fun. 10/10.

4. *Apotheosis of the Rose. A riotous bouquet of five species of heirloom roses elevated by rare white lotus, ethereal iris, and vine jasmine trailing over a glorious beauty of white amber, succulent jackfruit, glazed apricots, candied flower petals, absinthe blanche, kotata berries, and blonde woods.*  
Since I have and absolutely adore *Burning Roses,* I figured I'd give this one a try. Out of the bottle, the rose scent was pretty much covered by the lotus and iris; upon trying it on my skin, the notes settled a little more, and I could smell the roses very, very well. What can I say - it's roses. Roses are amazing, and have a unique scent to them that I can only describe as *sharp yet tender,* just like the flowers' petals. (Forgive my associations again.) When it dried down, the lotus and iris grew stronger once again, alongside the absinthe - it got a lot heavier, in a nice way. Over the next hours, the lotus and iris faded somewhat, leaving space for the apricots, berries, and finally, the scent vanished after giving me a bit with the jackfruit/roses/woods combo. It lasted quite a while, around 10-11 hours. 10/10, love this.

5. *As Dark Things Are Meant to be Loved. Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf.*  
*Oh.* This one was an instant, immediate *oh.* I don't think I've ever experienced falling in love with a perfume like I did with this one - out of the bottle, I can only describe it as mysterious, the tabac leaf giving it freshness I didn't quite expect. Immediately upon laying it down, I wished I could slather it all over myself - perhaps, I'll give in to that wish someday. The combination of lapsang souchong and temple incense was the most prominent one at that point, cut by the tabac leaf. As it dried down, other notes started unveiling, bit by bit - the amber, the patchouli, the coffee and finally, the opium to give it a deep sweetness. This perfume is what I would imagine shadows would smell like - it's subtle and ever-changing with each little sniff I took, it's enveloping, and it's very far from the heavy, incensey feel I imagined when ordering it. Sadly, the longevity on me isn't a dream - it only lasted about \~9 hours - but that just means I'll have to get a bigger bottle. 10/10, thinking of breaking the scales once again, this is an absolute joy to wear.

6. *Carmen 7. An indecent proposal of succulently spiced pear, exotic lychees, decadent French pralines, bourbon vanilla, and crushed almond blossoms leads to a ménage à trois of gardenia, star jasmine, and magnolia illuminated by the afterglow of a sensuously musky amber.*  
And just as I say I've never experienced falling in love with a perfume like with *Dark Things,* this one comes along. I want to roll in it. I want to bathe in it. I want to become one with it. Out of the bottle, it smells... thick, and I wasn't expecting *too* much when first trying it, but *oh.* Immediately when laying it down, the thickness turned to warmth - sheer gentle warmth. The pralines underline the spicy pears and ever-so-slightly sour lychees and what I'm assuming is jasmine (forgive me, I'm not good with floral scents.) in a way that feels like basking in the sun on a particularly nice summer day. After drying down, the florals shine in all their glory - the spicier notes fade into the background, while still being very much present, and the amber peeks in. This is all I could've hoped for and couldn't put to particular notes for a specific character. It has such a good longevity, too - around 14-15 hours. Can I eat perfume? (joking) 10/10, immediately planning to get a big bottle of it.

These are far from all the scents I've ordered this time around, but I just can't get enough of them. The rest might have to wait and sit a little before my brain lets me try them =) Out of the bottle, I have to say that every perfume was a hit. (I also got *Pretty Little Poisons, Gothique, Venym, Mist Becoming Rain* and *Salome.)*",18,1745190428.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

 I have been scavenging the internet trying to figure out what could be causing my issue. I have been bouncing ideas off of AI and due to that I asked it to poignantly summarize my question in hopes of not making something way too long. I'm well spoken but not to the extent of what it generated. 

I’m puzzled by some solvent purity tests I’m running and could use your insight. I’m evaporating droplets of technical-grade Naphtha and ACS-grade n-heptane on as clean of glass as I can get in as pristine of an environment that I can get to check for residues. Naphtha, which is less pure and evaporates slower, leaves a thin outline of a coffee ring effect. N-heptane, purer and faster-evaporating, leaves a swirl or bullseye pattern instead.

From my discussions with Grok, I understand the coffee ring effect involves capillary flow carrying non-volatile impurities to a droplet’s edge during evaporation, forming a ring. Naphtha’s thin ring likely comes from its impurities being deposited at the edge, possibly due to a pinned contact line and slow evaporation. But why is the ring so thin? Could it be a low impurity concentration or specific interactions with the glass?

N-heptane’s swirl/bullseye is confusing since it’s purer. Grok suggested its fast evaporation might disrupt outward flow, causing internal Marangoni flows or a receding contact line, depositing trace residues in a complex pattern. Could rapid evaporation induce surface tension gradients that create these swirls? Or might trace environmental contaminants (even in a clean setup) contribute? (This part is a bit puzzling to me the OP as I feel like I'm struggling to understand it so hoping someone could better explain this)

Why do these patterns differ despite n-heptane’s higher purity? Is Naphtha’s slower evaporation favoring a classic coffee ring, while n-heptane’s speed creates dynamic flows? Any thoughts on what’s driving the thin outline versus the swirl/bullseye, or how the solvents’ compositions (Naphtha’s hydrocarbon mix vs. n-heptane’s purity) affect evaporation dynamics? I’d love your take!



One of the details grok missed here, is well manually spreading the solvent by tilting the borosilicate glass in a circle, or by tilting it and allowing it run in a drip (causing it to evaporate quicker) I am then left with ONLY the faint coffee ring pattern (same as the naphtha which is just a very faint ring instead of the bullseye or swirl looking pattern)
Once again. Sorry for using AI It's just a week long back and forth condensed instead of me writing out something 5x as long in a very poor way(I don't have any real background in this stuff) 

Thanks to anyone who can offer any insight. I am quite perplexed. My N heptane is ASC grade and 3rd party tested. It has even been distilled by the company and everything so I am nearly sure these swirls are not a residue/oil/powder/crystalized impurity. It's just matter of me being morbidly curious as to what is taking place here. 

Edit: forgot to mention. I don't have lab grade solvents to clean the glass. Some store bought iso 92% alcohol and some store bought distilled water with some hard paper towels elbow grease. I'm assuming the water, paper towel and iso all have some types of residue left behind on the glass probably adding to the solvents coffee ring patterns.",0,1745190392.0,chemistry,0,0.5,False

1k3z0z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1k3z0z9/my_marriage_is_failing/,My marriage is failing,"Myself (21F) and my husband (36M) have been married for around 2 years, and together for almost 4. When we started dating, I was sleeping in my car and working at a coffee shop. He was a customer and looked much younger than his age. I thought he was really cute and he ended up asking me on a date. I had a really nice time and felt special. At this time, I still didn't know how old he was. I feel like he deliberately hid it from me as I talked about how I had just graduated from high school and just turned 18 and just bought my first car. We had mutual friends that encouraged our relationship and thought I would finally have someone that loved me. I didn't tell him right away that I was homeless, as I felt like our first dates were casual and I felt too embarrassed to bring it up. When he asked, I told him the truth. He opened up his home to me and let me sleep there. I had just found out how old he was after that. I was young and naive. I had a friend that was going to let me split rent with her, and when I tried leaving, he felt very offended and wouldn't let me leave. I didn't want to stay with him as I felt it was too soon and the age thing (he was 32) kind of freaked me out. A week passed, and he said his tenant (this tenant stayed in the spare bedroom) had decided to not come back. 
This is where he and I felt that I should help with some bills, as it would help offset the money he wasn't getting anymore. I paid him rent. 
I met his mother soon after. She said she owns a daycare (her business was failing) and needs help. I felt excited to work for her since it meant I could get more money as my coffee shop job gave me less than 40 hours (9/hr). I started off working both jobs. It soon became that she was pushing me to quit my other job as she promised she would pay me more and give me a  set schedule. I put in my 2 weeks. She ended up calling me crying and saying she needed me to go help as there wasn't enough people. When I got there, there were 40 children and only one other person. She was not there (I was so confused about this as she made it seem she was there and stressed out). Keep in mind, I was 18 and had never taken care of a child before, much less 10 toddlers and infants that were put in my care. I felt traumatized but I felt like I had no other choice. I didn't know what she did wasn't normal, and I thought maybe I was just not used to working hard. This is how she made it seem, BTW. 
I worked for her for a couple months until she said she didn't need me. I was crushed. I needed to work and her son wanted me to pay more every month. I looked for other jobs, and applied everyday. My bf was putting pressure on me and I started draining my savings to have a place to live. He was 33 at the time, I still 18. I felt scared and lost. I had always struggled with PTSD and started having horrible nightmares/depression. Eventually, MIL said she needed me for work again and the stress dissipated. That's when I started hearing from her that her son had decided we were getting married and she kept asking when I would give her a first grandchild. I felt happy that someone wanted to marry me as I thought no one would ever love me, but uneasy that I was never asked. It was decided. 
We got married just 7 months later. 
After that, everything changed. I felt utterly controlled. Fast forward 8 months, and I was pregnant at 19 just two months shy from my 20th bday. I was scared. Confused. But I knew I wanted my child.
I hoped the pregnancy would make things change, but it got worse from there. My MIL took me off the payroll and put my husband. He would receive the checks I worked for. Soon, I became totally dependent on him. I had no money and even had to ask him for help with my car payment. His mother started calling me fatty at work. My now husband was cold and controlling. I thought maybe I was dramatic and this is what growing up is about?
I gave birth to my beautiful son. It was a hard birth for both of us. I breastfed him for 8 months exclusively. I started working for MIL again when he was 5 months old. Baby was with me in the classroom. That's when I started receiving some horrible treatment from MIL. She starting saying how I was so lucky that I had a husband like her son and that I could depend on him (my checks were going to him btw). I went off the deep end. I attempted suicide and regretted it. I hoped no one would notice but my body started to shut down. My husband started to tell me how everything is my fault and I deserve to die. I woke up at the hospital. I then was moved to a  psych hospital for one week. 
When I got out, my MIL started saying that my son was her baby and didn't want to give him back to me. She then told me that she was going to take my child from me and get all her employees to back her up in court. Husband was annoyed that I bothered him with this information. I felt so scared. I left but had no where to go. I had to go back. 
Shit hit the fan. He started to become abusive and explosive. Eventually, there was an incident and I ended up at the hospital. Nothing serious, just an anxiety attack and infection. Police showed up to the hospital. They got a report and arrested him later that week when he admitted to what he did. An emergency protective order was filled. He was not allowed to see me or baby for 90 days. 
Cps got involved. He and his mother started telling them that I was abusive towards my child and were actively trying to turn everything on me. Thankfully, eventually CPS saw through the bs and baby and I were temporarily staying at a friend's place. Husband was forced to go to counseling and started saying how he was changed. He treated us better than before. He bought baby diapers and medicine (he never bought him anything before) and I felt conflicted. I felt like if I could give my son a chance at a normal family, I should deal with the discomfort and make it work for my baby. On the other hand, I had grown afraid of this man. But he seemed regretful and I wanted a better environment for my son. Eventually, we moved back in. Baby and I in a separate room. 
Things seemed to look up. Then husband stopped counseling. Now, he is starting to fall into his old ways. Nothing physically abusive, but he has started to become cold and controlling again.
I don't know what to do. I still feel conflicted. I want my son to have a family. Maybe with enough counseling things can work? Or am I just dramatic as everyone seems to think I am? I feel like a horrible mother but I also don't want my child to be struggling like how we were couch surfing. We now have a more secure home and he has his own space. I am afraid of going to a shelter as I've heard horrible stories about the local one, and feel like this is the better of both evils. My son is 17 months old and just a wonderful child. I want the best for him. I think to myself, maybe with enough time, things will get better.",16,1745190345.0,Marriage,23,0.9,False

I’m in my late 20s (M) and could really use some outside perspective on a friendship that recently blew up. A while ago, I met a guy at my school’s library — I’ll call him Charles. We hit it off and started hanging out almost every day. I felt comfortable enough to open up to him about really personal stuff — childhood bullying, family trauma, even mental health struggles I’ve worked through, including past suicidal thoughts. He seemed supportive and nonjudgmental at first. He introduced me to his church group and some of his friends. For a while, it felt like I had a solid support system.

But over time, some red flags popped up. He and his brother would bring up political stuff (they’re big Trump supporters), and they slowly started pushing those views. I tried to set boundaries and told them politics wasn’t something I wanted to get into. Charles asked if my views were just because of my dad (who’s a Democrat), which felt like he was trying to pick a fight or push me into a corner.

The next day, I texted him and said his comments came off as arrogant and asked for an apology. He refused to talk over text and insisted we meet. I agreed (even bought him coffee), but instead of a real conversation or any accountability, he basically unloaded on me. He said I had low self-esteem, accused me of trying to ""drag him down to my level,"" and even said the devil was speaking through me. He tried to force a prayer on me, asked for a hug I didn’t want to give, and just made me feel incredibly disrespected and judged. I walked away and cut ties after that.

Since then, I’ve stopped attending the church group. Some people from the group have texted asking where I’ve been, and I’ve just said I’m busy with school/work to keep things low-drama. His brother even removed me on LinkedIn. Now when Charles sees me around campus, he acts like nothing ever happened — gives me a fist bump and says “What’s up bro.” I go along with it to avoid more awkwardness, but it honestly feels fake.

Part of me worries that he might be telling people the personal things I confided in him to make me look unstable or win sympathy. I haven’t responded to any texts from him or his friends since late January. One of his friends still messages me occasionally with a casual “Let me know when you’re around,” but I keep brushing it off.

I guess my question is — am I handling this the right way? Should I respond to anyone or give some kind of explanation for why I cut things off? Or is it okay to just quietly distance myself and focus on protecting my own peace, even if it leaves the door open for them to spin their own version of things?

Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated. I’m trying not to carry guilt, but it’s hard not to wonder if I should’ve done things differently.**Title: How do I handle a friendship that ended badly and protect my peace without feeling guilty?**

1k3yzxm,https://i.redd.it/ng49g0kmm2we1.jpeg,“Professional’s” a.k.a everyone chasing their dreams in the industry!! -WWYD,"I’m currently in the transition from being a bar manager of two venues, to becoming an AGM of one singular venue. (Not open as of posting)

I’ve already, kinddda… been told I was a personality hire by the owner… (which, yes, I’m taking as a “BDE” complement!).

My worry… Is that I’m going to struggle to really show my knowledge and creativity within the new venue (and job) and may be expected to just be a very strong motivator. 

The concern above has hit me so hard now as a sentimental feeling, as I’m leaving behind my past creations, my display for my love of all things cocktails, wines and funky beers - along with my prior work of costing, r&d’ing, laughing, living and training my lovely staff to match my love.

I left for my desire to progress my career at 22YO.

Currently trying to fight the mentioned thoughts by getting crazy with cocktails at home hence coming to this sub. The picture shows my attempt of a 2 part old fashioned riff. 

Using:
15ml
- Granny Smith apple skins blanched, blitzed and strained into a (very.very.very mild) coffee syrup (made with 4parts maple, 2parts water, 1part honey & freeze dried coffee)

55ml
- 8yo single malt scotch, aged in a bourbon barrel (fat washed with salted butter for a bit of ‘OoMph’)

-These two together in batch-

1 dash of angostura

We take time to ourselves but also like to socialize. I also have a cat, so no more pets sadly. You’d share a bathroom with one other person.

1k3yy0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/flatearth/comments/1k3yy0e/the_earth_is_round_yeah_right_heres_why_its/,the earth is round yeah right here’s why it’s actually flat,"After years of meticulously ignoring the glaringly obvious signs, I’ve come to the *shocking* conclusion that the Earth is, in fact, round. Now, before you roll your eyes and dismiss this as ""mainstream science,"" let me walk you through all the so-called ""evidence"" that these so-called ""scientists"" have presented.

First off, they love to talk about ""photos"" of the Earth from space. Sure, they claim that these images show a beautiful, spherical planet, but has anyone ever asked how they managed to take such *perfect* pictures? With all the alleged satellites and space missions, it's almost like someone knew exactly how to make the Earth look round. Coincidence? Probably. But let’s move on.

Let’s talk about gravity. They say it pulls everything towards the center of the Earth, but here’s the real kicker: if the Earth is round, and gravity supposedly pulls things *down*, why don't we just fall off the edge? Wouldn't the gravitational pull be stronger at the bottom of the globe? Or, *plot twist*, does gravity just decide to start pulling *up* when you're near the top? It’s almost like it’s some kind of universal force that’s just *too convenient*.

Then there's the whole concept of ""curvature."" So, apparently, when you're on a plane flying across the world, you’re supposed to believe that you're *flying over a giant curve*. Let’s get real. I’ve been on enough flights to know that the horizon always looks perfectly flat, and I've never once noticed a ""drop"" below me. What kind of world is this where we’re told we’re soaring over a sphere and yet we still can’t even feel the *tilt*?

And, of course, we have the moon. Oh, the moon. It’s not just a giant glowing rock in the sky, oh no—it’s allegedly a part of this ""round Earth system."" We’re told that the moon's gravity influences our tides, but doesn’t that just sound a little too *convenient*? I mean, who’s really controlling this cosmic drama behind the scenes? Are we just supposed to accept that the moon’s gravity pulls water all over the Earth’s spherical surface without *anyone* ever questioning how it perfectly works with the *entire ocean*? Makes you think.

Finally, let’s talk about the ""edge"" of the Earth. I’ve heard all the stories about people ""sailing off the edge,"" yet somehow, here we are, surrounded by endless water and no one ever *seems* to fall off. Amazing, right? It’s like they’re just *pretending* we’re spinning around in space at thousands of miles per hour while we continue to enjoy our daily coffee like nothing is wrong.

So, there you have it: the Earth is round, and the ""science"" behind it is as convincing as a magic trick. Just don’t question it, and certainly don’t look too closely at how things *might* not add up. The round Earth theory is here to stay, and you’d better just accept it… even though it might not make sense.",0,1745190102.0,flatearth,13,0.48,False
1k3yxvx,https://i.redd.it/0iarns05m2we1.jpeg,Coffee Bean Sign,"☕ What is it? The Coffee Bean Sign is a radiological finding seen in closed-loop bowel obstruction, where a loop of intestine twists and fills with fluid, resembling a coffee bean on imaging.

🩺 Why does it matter? Spotting this sign early can help diagnose volvulus (a life-threatening bowel twist) and prompt timely intervention.

🔍 Where is it seen? Most commonly in sigmoid volvulus, a condition often seen in older adults or those with chronic constipation.

⚡ Quick action saves lives! Delayed treatment can lead to bowel ischemia or perforation—so recognizing this sign is crucial for surgeons & radiologists.

💡 Fun fact: The name comes from its uncanny resemblance to a coffee bean when viewed on an X-ray or CT scan!

Unfortunately my weekend has been pretty nasty. I work at a coffee shop, and it's no surprise that the Easter churchgoing customers were some of the rudest customers we've seen since Christmas (Sunday customers are just always pretty mean in general too). A coworker friend of mine also was forced to go on leave this week bc he was in a crash and needed to have a leg amputated. So...not great stuff on top of the ongoing political stress/dysphoria.

I wear pride pins at work bc I'm allowed to, but I kind of regret wearing them today in front of all the religious customers. I do tend to get worse treatment from customers (especially men) when I wear them. I don't fully regret it tho, bc I do get  satisfaction from making homophobic/transphobic customers feel uncomfortable. 

I do still struggle a lot with feeling comfortable wearing traditionally ""feminine"" things despite still liking those things, but I'm treating myself to some pink trinkets tonight to help make up for the day. Might as well take their hate and use it to fuel more confidence to be myself!
