- Went out to get coffee together really near the office and we halfed a cake (his treat) then walked back to eat at our desks.

1j327wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1j327wc/friend_breakup_at_work_stress/,Friend breakup at work stress,"As a bit of background, I've had a very difficult time over the past 6 months personally, some traumatic events stemming from an ex partner. I don't have lots of family support emotionally or many friends that have been able to handle it. One of my co-workers who I didn't know well really stepped up, we became very close quickly and she's been there every step. It has been alot, alot I haven't been able to control, and I probably did become a little too much emotional in the midst of what was happening. 

She was there, we got to know each other better and had become very close (speaking over weekends alot, her telling me about her life etc), she even fielded a delivery in the last two weeks that came to work from my ex so it wasn't obvious to the whole office. I've been so grateful and told her that, always checked she was ok to listen etc. We've been very busy at work the past few weeks, and I haven't really talked about it all because I was trying hard to seperate my work and personal. Just for context, I'm in therapy and she does know that. I took a few days off work with anxiety from everything and when I went back it was so different, to the point she didn't even speak to me first thing to say morning.

Usually and for the past six months we've chatted in a morning, walked out together, grabbed coffee or gone for a walk over lunch etc so this was unusual. She knows I have a fear of losing people after having alot not be able to cope with what's happened. Last Monday, we walked out and she gave me a hug and told me I wasn't going to lose her. But it still felt different and was uncomfortable, I found myself crying for an hour before work, worried about seeing her etc. I checked in multiple times to see how she was and just got back a version of I'm fine with two kisses on the message like usual, but I got the sense she was talking about me with a few people including my manager. I was so upset after being ignored late last week  and trying to communicate in person, via message etc that I wrote her a letter. I know it was over the top to do, it told her I valued her and what I valued about her etc, said sorry that I had probably clung to her too hard recently and thanked her. 

I received a message today saying she hasn't read the letter and thinks we need to keep it proffessional. Which of course, I'll respect and I haven't replied. I'm just so confused, hurt and lost, I knew something had changed and I know it has likely been me/my situation being too much but to go from telling me one week I wouldn't lose her and hugging me to this is just such a 180. I was even partly expecting something to come, or her decide she didn't believe me about what I've been going through because others haven't but tried not to overthink when she assured me. 

I just have no idea what to think, feel or how on earth to act when I see her. I don't think trying to talk it out is a good idea, her message was clear and direct. We see each other every day, have projects to work on together and quite often are alone in the office together. And the person I had a sense she was talking to me about has also stopped speaking to me, so it's going to be isolating, they are the loudest two and most liked people in our department. 

I guess I'm just hurting and looking for advice about how to be professional when every time I think about her I want to cry. ",2,1741061113.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

And now it’s asking me to rate my own replacement. It seems that AI has become the new office gossip mill, shaking up industries, artists, and startups like a rogue DJ at a silent disco.

But in reality, AI-powered tools have slipped into our lives as seamlessly as those autocorrect fails we’ve all been victim to. And the art world? Oh, it’s not immune. You see, some artists are swapping their brushes for algorithms, using AI to generate art, logos, and even graphic novels. Adobe leads the charge, ensuring their AI learns only from licensed images, much to the relief of many.

Yet, the creativity debate rages on—can machine-generativity ever replicate the human heart? Some artists fear their jobs getting a tech ax, but others see AI as a catalyst. It’s like giving a struggling band a pro-level synthesizer and watching them soar to new sounds.

Interestingly, platforms like Fiverr are now allowing artists to harness AI to automate mundane tasks or even create AI tools based on their style. It’s as if AI is saying, “Trust me; you’ll have more time to sip that third coffee today.”

In the grand tapestry of human creativity, is AI a masterstroke or a misplaced splash? Will we reach a harmonious blend, or is this the digital age’s rendition of Frankenstein’s monster?

Just imagine it at a startup party: snatching everyone's jobs while nodding to the DJ's beats—#aiKilledMyStartup, indeed.

Welcome to the wild, unpredictable world of AI's impact on startups. It's like Game of Thrones, but instead of dragons, we have algorithms breathing fire into every industry imaginable. Let's break it down:

**AI: The Ultimate Job Thief?**
AI is fast becoming more efficient than caffeine in a programmer's diet. Startups find their dev teams outpaced by AI that’s cheaper, faster, and doesn’t demand coffee breaks. Picture this: waking up one day to realize your app's backend has been rebuilt overnight by an AI that not only worked overtime but offered to optimize your coffee machine too. Uncanny valley, much?

**Survival of the Quickest**
It's like Darwinian evolution but in startup-land. Evolve with AI or face extinction faster than a 90s tech fad. But here’s the twist—AI isn’t your enemy. It could be your sidekick, making the mundane magical and scaling your ideas faster than you can say “series A funding.” The secret? Aligning AI’s capabilities with your vision, turning it from a foe into a formidable companion.

**Startup Success or Flop?**
The million-dollar question: does AI ensure startup success or doom it to VC rejection and a ""pivot"" sticker slapped on your office door? It’s about strategic incorporation. Use AI not just as a tool but as an influencer that shapes and enhances your business landscape.

**The Real Question**
So, does AI kill startups, or does it trim the herd, leaving only the strong—or the strategically savvy? Perhaps it’s less about who the AI crushes and more about how the survivors adapt.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\

1j323mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amtrak/comments/1j323mw/acela_first_class_baltimore_to_boston/,Acela First Class- Baltimore to Boston,"I got caught up in the BWI power outage today and decided to take my chances with the train instead. Since I had an upgrade coupon, I went all in on Acela First Class. 

Since I had a few questions about first class, I thought I'd share what I learned.

I boarded at 1:25 and they immediately brought me a little bowl of mixed nuts, asked if I wanted a drink, and dropped off a menu. 7 minutes after boarding, I had lunch on my tray. I went with the manicotti, which was frozen Stouffer's quality, so not bad. The roll was warm and very good, as was the tiramisu. They came around many times (almost constantly) cleaning up and taking more drink orders. Around New York, they brought steaming hot fingertip towels. When they returned to collect them, there was cash on the tray, so that answered my question of when to tip. I left a $20 and they really stepped up the attention after that. One attendent spent the next three hours trying to bring me cocktails. I ordered a coffee and he suggested Bailey's to go along. After NY they took another meal order, so I went with the cheese plate, which was fantastic, and a seltzer. I finally gave in to the attendant's pressue and ordered a margarita in Connecticut.

The last question I had was whether I could use the lounge \*after\* arriving in Boston and the answer was yes. They did seem a little confused why someone was coming at nearly 8pm, but they asked if I was First Class and didn't check the ticket to confirm. The attendant asked if I just wanted to hang out. I said I wanted a bite to eat and he said they only had snacks, so I grabbed a few things and left.

Overall, the First Class experience was great, but the trip was a little too long to replace my usual flights from Baltimore to Boston. As it turned out, my resheduled flight got in only 3 hours earlier than the train. I would rather sit on a train than in an airport any day.",14,1741060737.0,Amtrak,1,1.0,False

I’m not sure what country she was from but she responded with, “I don’t do coffee”. He then says some other things hinting at her being a gold digger. I’m not here to debate whether she is or not but I do want to give my two cents about the situation. 

I’ve dated in Thailand, Philippines, and Colombia. If I ever asked a women out for coffee and she replied, “I don’t do coffee” and that’s it, to me that’s a red flag. I think sometimes men give too much leeway while dating internationally and end up displaying simp characteristics. They think to themselves “Oh this is a sweet traditional Filipina (or whatever nationality) so I need to be more accommodating.” To me “I don’t do coffee” is obviously a rude way of responding to someone who wants to get to know you.

However if she responded something like, “I don’t like coffee very much, could we do something else?” Then that would leave me open to move forward with planning something out. If a women is truly interested in you they’ll be happy with any setting.

I think a walk in a park, coffee, going to the beach, are all good ways of getting to know someone without spending money. And sometimes are even more fun then a traditional dinner date.

Let me know what you guys think.

I [F24] was with my ex-boyfriend [M25], who I have been with for 2 years. We broke off just recently due to other circumstances. Anyways, my ex really loved competitive games, such as Dota2 and Valorant. His rank is exceptionally high, Ancient for Dota2 and Platinum for Valorant. I, as a girlfriend who would want to spend time with him, also try to catch up to his rank, but most of all just to be with him. 

Days before we split up, he gets tilted so much that he just displaces his anger at me. Oh, he did not live on a clash? He would yell at me and say why I did not keep him alive (I am a support main). Oh, the enemy caught him farming at our own side of the map? He would proceed to tell me that I was not there to be with him. Once he gets angry, it just continues until we play another game, and then the same result is that we would lose as he did not get over it. The same goes for Valorant. Only this time, he gets mad at everyone for not following his calls.

For the emotional aspect, he would also bring up his girl friends in our convo, and saying that he had met other girls at Reddit, especially from the Philippine Hookup Subreddit. It really devastated me when I heard it, because I would always think that he would go to other girls when we would fight about how we lost the game. In fact, he had told me that he met a girl online and how he was curious to go to a coffee shop and get to know her.

Now that we broke up, I cannot help but think that it is for the best that we had split up. But I also cannot play peacefully with my usual games because I am always reminded of him and his toxicity. ",1,1741060615.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

Teeth whitening is an exciting cosmetic procedure that can transform your smile and boost your confidence. However, many people are unsure about what they can eat and drink immediately after the treatment. One common question that arises is whether butter is safe to consume following a teeth whitening procedure. Understanding the do's and don'ts of post-whitening nutrition is crucial to maintaining your brilliant new smile and protecting your investment in dental aesthetics. Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

What Happens During Teeth Whitening?

When you undergo teeth whitening, the procedure temporarily makes your tooth enamel more porous and sensitive. During this time, your teeth are more susceptible to staining and potential damage from certain foods and beverages. The whitening process opens up the pores in your tooth enamel, making them more vulnerable to external factors that could compromise your fresh, bright smile.

Why Food Choices Matter After Teeth Whitening

Immediately after teeth whitening, your teeth are in a delicate state. The whitening agents used during the procedure create microscopic openings in the enamel, which can easily trap pigments from foods and drinks. This means you need to be extra careful about what you consume to maintain your newly brightened smile. Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Can You Eat Butter After Teeth Whitening?

Good news for butter lovers! **Butter is generally considered safe to eat after teeth whitening**. Here's why:

1. Neutral color: Butter is a light-colored food that won't stain your teeth
2. Low acidity: Unlike acidic foods, butter won't damage your newly whitened enamel
3. Soft texture: It's gentle on sensitive teeth

Recommendations for Consuming Butter Post-Whitening

• Wait at least 48 hours after the whitening procedure
• Choose plain, unsalted butter
• Avoid butter with added colors or flavors
• Consume in moderation
• Rinse your mouth with water after eating

Foods to Avoid After Teeth Whitening

While butter is safe, several foods can compromise your whitening results:

• Dark-colored sauces
• Red wine
• Coffee
• Berries
• Tomato-based products
• Colored condiments

Potential Risks of Eating the Wrong Foods

Consuming inappropriate foods after teeth whitening can:
- Reduce the effectiveness of the whitening treatment
- Cause temporary tooth sensitivity
- Create new stains on your freshly whitened teeth
- Prolonged discomfort or sensitivity

Hydration and Oral Care Tips

Staying hydrated is crucial after teeth whitening. Drink plenty of water and:
1. Use a straw for any beverages
2. Rinse your mouth after eating
3. Maintain good oral hygiene
4. Use a sensitive toothpaste

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Expert Tips for Long-Lasting Whitening Results

Professional dentists recommend:
• Stick to a ""white diet"" for 48 hours
• Avoid tobacco products
• Use a whitening toothpaste
• Schedule regular dental cleanings
• Consider touch-up treatments

When to Consult Your Dentist

If you experience:
- Extreme tooth sensitivity
- Prolonged discomfort
- Unexpected changes in tooth color
- Unusual reactions after whitening

Professional guidance is always recommended.

Conclusion

Understanding what you can eat after teeth whitening is essential for maintaining your bright smile. Butter is generally safe and can be enjoyed in moderation. By following professional recommendations and being mindful of your diet, you can preserve the stunning results of your teeth whitening procedure and enjoy a confident, radiant smile for weeks and months to come.

Gagne argues that these medications will transform industries built on impulse purchases, from restaurants and retail to advertising and entertainment. ""When you change how hundreds of millions of people make decisions, the economic impact is incalculable.""

In 2021, Lisa Chen, a software engineer, started a new weight-loss medication. Then, something interesting happened at her local coffee shop, her employer's healthcare costs, and the global economy.

In six months, Lisa stopped buying her daily morning muffin, causing the coffee shop to lose $600 in annual revenue from one customer. Within a year, she canceled her beer-of-the-month subscription and stopped ordering late-night DoorDash. By 2023, her grocery bill dropped 40%, alcohol spending fell 85%, and impulse Amazon purchases plunged 60%.

Lisa is one person. Her story will become the story of hundreds of millions.

Gagne writes, ""Madison Avenue is quietly panicking. One major agency (which asked not to be named) estimates that 50% of their current advertising strategies will be obsolete by 2027. They are right to worry.""

It was a 1000 word essay, part of weekly assignments collectively worth 5% of the course grade—so individually, this one was worth less than 0.5%.

I’m juggling a lot this semester, so I had to prioritize and was honestly never going to submit that particular assignment. When I admitted I hadn’t, they openly expressed their frustration saying “I’ve given you more than two weeks” and dismissed me from participating in the class presentation I was originally scheduled for and had prepared for (worth 25%), stating they were “still mad at me.” When I asked to meet after class to discuss the situation, they refused, saying they “needed to get coffee.” I left feeling hurt, embarrassed, and disrespected.

During that whole ordeal, they also said something along the lines of “I have a life too and I don’t have time to go chasing students down for these things.” My immediate thought (which I did not express at the time) was—then don’t? If I don’t submit something and get a zero, that’s my loss. Chasing me down or calling me out is certainly not your responsibility.

I had to leave the classroom and cry multiple times during that class, and the professor still picked on me throughout the class. They kept asking me whether I understood the concepts they were teaching.

10-12g salt 
100-130 g starter

Process:

I've found no real difference if you just use extra warm water to mix dough together before adding the starter. 

My stretch and folds happen a lot more than 4 times over 2 hours. I think that's a waste of time. 

Instead, every 5-8 minutes, get up and stretch and fold. I do this until the dough looks like a tall round ball. Idk how to really describe it other than sight, also if it has a snappy little pop when your girlfriend ( or whatever partner you so choose ) walks by and taps on it before she head to work. 

When it looks like that and sounds like that, it's ready for bulk. 

I'm going to say a timeline, and it's not going to work for you. Your room temperature and other factors dictate that. Today I BF'd for 9-10 hours. I think it might have been a little long but it was out of my control. But it turned out wonderfully. Whole house is asking for seconds 

I've found a bit of freedom in my ratios. So that's why there are some ""guesstimations"" in most of the measurements. This also yields a half size load that everyone can munch on for s couple of days, not feel bad or bloated, and I have reason to bake in a few days, and bread never goes bad.

They appear to have made pottery originally in New Haven in the 60's, and later on in both Winooski and South Burlington, based on images of mugs that are all over Google and Etsy/FB Marketplace.

The only address that Google gave was in Middlebury, VT, but looking at it on StreetView, the address looks like it's actually for Vermont Soap, so I wasn't sure if that was right.  I can't find an active website or anything for Onion River, but various online shops are selling products made by them, and I am unsure if it's just the sale and resale of old items of theirs or if new stock is being quietly produced somewhere (or I'm just seeing cheap knockoffs).  The glazing and color of the clay make for a really unique speckle effect that would make this brand instantly recognizable.

We had kind of always planned to move up here together and I was okay with the idea for a long time. After it was inching nearer we discussed living closer to where we are from in (30 minute difference) and she said maybe but eventually just said only LA makes sense for her. We both can’t afford to live independently so we kind of just defaulted and I ended up here. I’ve had my concerns because I’ve been depressed all of my life and have anxiety and ocpd (I’m on meds, have done a lot of treatment, and am totally stable). I don’t have really anyone up here besides her friends/ partner and I am not being invited on a ton of outing with her friends. Which is fine, I knew this was a likelihood moving up here and I have a perfectly friend group back at home that I love dearly.. anyways she’s been gone a few nights and I’ve been wfh shut in a bit. She’s going to travel for a month this year and I’m feeling so scared for that time as well.. I feel a good amount of anxiety and sadness. I took myself for a walk and did all of my usual coping. I want to go do things, art classes, hikes, group activities, etc. but I have developed really rough arthritis the past few months. I used to paint to cope but I can’t paint for long without pain, I used to play video games when bored and alone, but it hurts badly/ can mean that it’ll be more painful for me to work and live the next day-week. I just feel really stuck. I know I put myself in this position, I just don’t know what more to do. I don’t blame or hold resentment at all, and I am pushing myself to do healthy things within my own capabilities, even if it’s just a walk or going to a coffee shop. I don’t want to do bumble or anything like that- I have a lot of nerves about the safety of it and it feels like forcing a friendship. I am good with like a healthy amount of alone time too I love time to myself and can be a bit introverted at times. It just feels heavy and like alone time that I am not voluntarily having lol. I have had one friend drive up to hang out, but it’s a big ask, and not many of my friends have the free time to come hang out. I just need to find my way, it’s still early. I come down to OC two days a week and my partner comes up to me on the weekends which is wonderful! I just feel a bit spirally and sad.

Thenn the sun was out and that meant great vibes. Mom and I went down and picked today's flowers from our lil garden. She also picked a handful of yellow flowers from the neighbors tree. 
Then I sat out in the sun for a while downstairs. Came back to my room, It was soothing I guess so now I'm sleepy lol. I hears crows, sparrows and other birds calling in the distance, aand some construction work lol but still it's very peaceful laying on my bed like this. There's also something about the sound the ceiling fan makes going at high speed. You know.. Some sounds you just feel so nostalgic for. I am mildly reminded of my childhood home when I was prolly 3 or 4, somewhere in the suburbs of this city. I barely remember a thing, except a very faint memory, a faint view of the inside of the house in summer light. Just nice natural lighting inside, as if im looking at the bedroom and kitchen from the main door, another door towards the other end of the home also just visible in frame. Quiet, noones there. I wonder why my mom isn't there in the memory. I can't really tell if I'm just imagining that, but just me standing there, barely knowing that I would be reminded of that exact moment, Ee madhya baga gurthosthundi... Idk if 3 yr old me could even comprehend what I'm saying, feeling right now. I've come a long way. Makes you wonder how the years have passed, but the longing for that solitude, quietness, peace,innocence still remains. Maybe it's just the warmth that my current life is lacking, maybe that's why I'm reminded of those specific hues I saw - the golden yellow, burnt orange warm tones I saw that day(or atleast what I think i saw) ... That was perhaps the moment I felt at peace and my then subconscious decided to etch it in my mind forever.

It's basically 1 big room w/ 20-ish students and 3 teachers. Really, really good teacher-to-student ratio.

Right know they're getting screwed over by Cox w/ a rented Wifi solution which is about $200 / month. And they didn't even set it up with a single SSID, so kids on one end of the room have to connect to a different network with a different password than kids on the other end of the room.

Since I'm the tech-minded parent I foolishly offered to help them plan out an upgrade to replace the existing network. In the past I've set up my brother's coffee shop using Ubiquiti equipment - EdgeRouterX, UniFi Security dongle, and two UniFi APs. It's rock solid, but old at this point; and I figured this school doesn't need as advanced of a setup since it won't be serving as many devices.

I'm also going to recommend them upgrading to AT&T Fiber, but was planning to still use our own provided router + APs for performance (set the fiber ONT to passthrough).

Daily network load will be:

* About 30 laptops between students, teachers, and aides
* 2-3 TVs they cast to for presentations
* An Xbox & Switch they use during downtime
* Some healthy room for future expansion
* Needs to support custom DNS overrides for basic adult content & virus filtering (CloudFlare [1.1.1.1](http://1.1.1.1/) for Families, or possibly a Pi-hole in the future)
   * (This is a small microschool so the usual legal requirements for filtering do not apply, but these will be nice-to-haves over their current nothing)

I've been looking at maybe a UniFi Express + 1 U6+ AP? It looks like the UniFi Express can combine the functionality of an EdgeRouter X + the Gateway dongle into one thing that's also an AP, so I'll only need one more? Plus some CAT6 in the ceiling connecting the two of course...

What do you guys recommend? I'm not necessarily married to Ubiquti though I am familiar with it, so it'll be easier on *me* if that's the route they go. I just want to get them something solid so they don't have any more problems with, especially if I'm going to be volunteering to be the ad-hoc network admin as needed.",2,1741058743.0,Ubiquiti,3,1.0,False

Some days I'm doing fine, some days I feel like I'm back to square one. After the breakup I decided to go on a few dates, a month after the breakup, there was this one person who really stood out to me, I was really attracted to. The first date wasn't perfect but it was fun, we had some drinks. I was honest to this guy from the start, told him that I hadn't long came out of a bad relationship but knew I deserved better. He was unsure about the date halfway through as he said he thought I was still kinda grieving and he didn't know what to do. He then asked for a kiss which I thought was extremely sweet, I never got kissed properly in my previous relationship. We spoke some more about his culture as he's from a culture that I am part of, but have never experienced as have never been to that part of the world. He openly admitted to being a player but didn't want that lifestyle anymore as it made him lonely. So after that, I taken on board what he said, I do believe people can change, but I believe actions over words. I did get a bit drunk as we was drinking and I was super nervous as I was really attracted to him. We went dancing as his culture are very good dancers (not sure if this is a stereotype)... I fell and he didn't help me up, I was drunk so I guess it was best me helping myself back up. He was hands on, not in a pervy way but in a loving way. (If this makes sense). The second date, we went to the park, it was nice we had a coffee and a walk, again he was hands on, and I told him that I wasn't wanting to go further. He seemed a bit annoyed but I stand on what I allow. After the second date he sent me a text saying he did like me but I needed to heal properly from the breakup, which I completely understood. After a few months he decided to text me, around 6 if I wanted to go to his house as his family were at a football match, I told him no, as I want to get to know him better before we do anything, and after that he messaged me every so often. He has my Instagram and likes some of my pictures, but I'm really wondering... Is he still a player... Or have I had my heart broken that I might be pushing him away?... Truthfully I don't know what to do? Should I just delete him off my socials? I could be making something out of nothing but his Facebook popped up and on his picture there's a girl that heart reacted to his picture and he follows her on everything, she looks like a work colleague but the way he behaved with me, makes me question him? How do I not know that he's messing about with her or other girls? He said he'd like to go out with me then cancelled last minute. I truthfully feel like an option, which I've told him and he seems to try to deflect it by saying things like are you sure? I truthfully don't know what to do? I don't want to get hurt again and I definitely don't want to be an option for someone when I can be a priority for the right person.",1,1741058500.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

But what are some lesser-mentioned Doe cases that have stuck out to you? And why is that? What is strange about the case? Here are some of my own:

**Anne Arundel County John Doe 1972** ([NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/4840), [Doe Network](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1966ummd.html), [wiki](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Anne_Arundel_County_John_Doe_(1972))): On April 30, 1972, the body of a homeless Black man was found in a landfill in Linthicum, Maryland. The abandoned house that he had been sleeping in was demolished. John Doe died of a skull fracture as well as other injuries after being hit by debris during the demolition. His body was carried to the landfill with the rest of the debris.

**Goliad County John Doe 1986** ([NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/9942/details?nav), [Doe Network](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/software/main.html?id=71umtx)): On March 17, 1986, an unidentified 20-30 year old white man was using a flashlight to guide a plane onto a road on a ranch in Goliad County, TX. The pilot of the plane, which was a stolen Cessna, apparently failed to properly recover from a bounced landing and broke a landing gear wheel. John Doe was hit by either the plane's propeller or the landing gear; according to NamUs, a piece of body tissue was found on an area near the wheel. The man's body was then transported about four or five miles and thrown into a river. On March 24, 1986, he was found 300 yd from a bridge, near where the empty aircraft was found burned the week before.

**Lancaster Jane Doe 1968** ([NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/2994), [DN](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Lancaster_Jane_Doe_(1968)), [wiki](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Lancaster_Jane_Doe_(1968))): On December 8, 1968, a group of hunters discovered the mummified body of a 30-50 year old white woman buried in a homemade coffin in the desert in Lancaster, LA County, CA. She had been shot once in the temple 2-3 months prior. She was wearing a two-piece pajama set and a bathrobe, with bobby pins and a hair net in her hair. Investigation showed that she had given birth to at least one child, and had a hysterectomy. A paper bag covered Jane Doe's head, which was resting on a brocade pillow; her body was wrapped in two matching quilts. The coffin was wooden, and the top had been glued and nailed down, then painted red. A copy of the *LA Times* from July 1, 1967 was inside the coffin as well.

**Mesa John Doe 2001** ([NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1970?nav) **(PM warning)**, [Doe Network](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/software/main.html?id=2313umaz), [clipping](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-arizona-republic-jan-30-2001-john-d/14837839/), [composite](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-arizona-republic-mesa-john-doe-2001/167167347/)): On January 24, 2001, a 20-40 year old white and/or Hispanic man was sleeping in a dumpster in Mesa, AZ when he was accidentally transferred into a garbage truck. The driver was compacting the garbage in the truck when he heard the man screaming. The driver pulled over at a nearby convenience store and called 911; firefighters pulled John Doe out of the truck and had to revive him. He received crushing internal injuries. He was taken to the hospital, where he told firefighters in Spanish that his name was Agustino. He died in the hospital six days later.

**Bronx Jane Doe July 1989** ([NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/6953/details?nav), [wiki](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Bronx_Jane_Doe_(July_1989))): On July 7, 1989, an unidentified Hispanic woman was using a telephone cord to lower herself from the roof of a building to the apartments within to burglarize them when the cord snapped and she fell to her death. She had burglarized another property earlier that day, the stolen belongings found in a bag on the top of the apartment building she fell from. She was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

**Wake County Jane Doe 1968** ([NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/16339/details?nav), [DN](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/474ufnc.html), [wiki](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Wake_County_Jane_Doe_(1968)) **(PM warning for all three links)**): On April 27, 1968, a 35-45 year old woman was seen walking down a road in McCullers Crossroads, a community near Fuquay Varina in North Carolina. One witness told investigators that her mother and sister saw the woman as they drove up the road; when they came back 15 minutes later, they saw a fire burning in the field, though assumed a farmer was burning something. The next day, the woman's body was discovered in that spot. A fuel can was found near the body, and she had been burned up to the stomach. Soot was found in Jane Doe's wind pipe, indicating that she was alive when set alight. Jane Doe was white with possible Indigenous admixture, and may have been from Canada. Investigators are treating her case as a homicide.

**San Diego John Doe January 1972** ([NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/135991?nav)): At 3:30pm on January 13, 1972, John Doe spoke to a man living at 253 N 21st St and asked him if it was ok to stay on his lawn. At about 5:10pm, John Doe was seen on all fours in front of the residence by the homeowner. John Doe was assisted to the rear of the residence and given some coffee and food; he started declining immediately and died before medics could arrive. Among other belongings, the man had one 20 cent Singapore coin and one 25 cent Philippines coin on him at the time. This John Doe was added to NamUs on January 5, 2025, and that page is the only information available on him right now.",27,1741058347.0,UnresolvedMysteries,10,1.0,False

I grew up in an oppressive cult and dysfunctional & abusive household. I still have physical scars from when one of my parents stabbed me. The mental & emotional scars are likewise, forever. I exited that cult, and lost my community & the only person I consider family. 

I worked hard to set myself up to a comfortable life, then covid happened and made a mess of things. Housing became ridiculous, grocery prices skyrocketed, and health care is now a myth. I have decent income, above national average actually, but still my life is now a struggle of managing bills, debt, health issues, and loneliness. I'm not a spender, I don't even drink coffee. Even then, I'm just struggling to just survive. 

I can't afford good health insurance. So any health issues I have, I just try to ignore until I can't anymore. I can't afford therapist. I can't afford to travel.

My doctor is worried about my health. I take control of what I can. I eat mostly healthy, and exercise when I'm not too depressed to. I always have, it's not a new lifestyle. He said I need to work on managing stress. But how... My problems are real and they're not going anywhere. 

I don't have anyone, I can't afford pets. I try to numb the loneliness by binge watching TV shows. I tried to aggressively make friends in the past for a few years, but then I realize I'm the only one reaching out & making things happen. As soon as I stopped, my phone became dead silent. 

When they were going through something, I tried my best to be there, but I'm too insecure to ask for emotional support or share my struggles, and in the rare events that I do, I feel like I'm driving them away. So I gave up on people, it was making me even more depressed to try. I don't entirely blame them, maybe I'm just too broken to befriend, maybe my expectations are ridiculous, I don't know what it is.

I'm always on the fight or flight mode. I'm anxious all the time, I think it's mostly to do with the fact that my support system is non existent. If something were to happen to me, career wise or health wise, I have no means of survival.

So now I don't know why I'm even here. I have nothing & noone to live for. I don't see the point anymore. I'm not suicidal, but I feel like I'm just waiting for my stress to finally kill me.

I feel like I'm just playing a rigged game, even from my childhood, I never had the means to make it, even when I tried, I'm just constantly on the edge of losing.

My friend and I are both in our mid 20s. She finished school a few years back and got laid off 2 years ago, and hasn’t got a job since that incident. We share a lot with one another but she also moved pretty far so I don’t see her a lot. I have problems with sleeping and my anxiety. Like sometimes I would be shaking and in fear of the next day. I also went from being super anxious about my health to very avoidant. I have some appointments I need to bite the bullet on and just do. Trust me, I will. And I’m filled with shame and regret over that. 

She will sometimes tell me she drinks a lot or engages in hook ups and she’s depressed or down and tells me she’s happy im not as unwell as she is/ I’m not as down and haven’t experienced the hardships of her life so I don’t resort to the habits she has. I often tell her I hope she gets better but for example she’ll say she has no money or shouldn’t hook up with guys or drink, and I do not want to give unsolicited advice but I say I can listen and support. I’ve shared some of my sleep and anxiety struggles. Recently I’ve had fear of going places too far from home, previously it was way worse. I go through phases and I don’t have the best support system. 

But I feel like she will tell me my experience isn’t bad, or it’s just a phase. I’m actually trying to find a therapist after years of people saying to just stop drinking coffee and I’ll not be anxious. I try to have good habits but people would shame me for saying I’d like therapy. My friend herself told me I believe the negative self talk I do which manifests it. Also sometimes she’ll just ignore my messages but expect an answer when it’s regarding her. I feel like I don’t wanna one up her with who has it worse but she just sent me a paragraph about how that essentially is the case",2,1741058154.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

1j318ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j318ks/i_initiate_all_the_plans_and_ive_already_talked/,I initiate all the plans and I’ve already talked to him about how I want more planned dates and hangouts. How do I bring this up if at all? 20M 23 F,"I’ve been seeing this guy for two months. The first 2 weeks were really nice where he was initiating most of the hangouts and he planned actual dates like Fast Lanes or coffee shops. Then it started to drop off around week 3-6 where the hangouts were being asked the day of and I also started initiating most of the hangouts. By week 5-6 I was initiating like all of the hangouts and were day of. I felt like I was putting in more effort by not only making most of the plans but by asking him that week what days he was free. So i stopped asking before hand and did what he did which was ask day of. I communicated by the end of week 6 that we hadn’t gone on an actual date that wasn’t hanging out in our cars (he lives at home and I didn’t want to introduce him to my roommates) or getting fast food after work since week 2. I told him I feel like I’m just convenient when he doesn’t make planned dates for us or even ask me more than a day in advance to hangout. I told him it makes me feel bad waiting on him each day hoping he’ll ask to hang out. I said I understand we have different work schedules, social lives, extracurriculars, but it makes me feel bad like he just wants to hangout with me if he has the time that day. He said he was sorry and would make the effort to plan more dates and I’m not convenient. 

That worked for 2 weeks (week 7-8) where he planned two dates (One each week). The other 2-3 times those weeks we hung out, I initiated. Granted those I asked were still the day of as well. But they were very last minute like him getting off work at 10 and me asking at 10 if he wants to come over. I understand that it goes both ways but it makes me sad bc i already told him I wanted more planned hangouts and maybe I should’ve communicated not just one a week. Bc I feel like if I didn’t ask him to hangout that day, we wouldn’t have seen each other at all those weeks. 

Now we’re at the start of week 9 and he hasn’t given me any heads up abt any planned date. I understand he just did last week and the week after, but I’m still not satisfied because like today, I was waiting by my phone all day for him to text me. I gave in and asked if he wanted to hang out today and he said he has plans with his friends. 

More context is that we work together. Plz I don’t want to hear any advice abt how it was  bad idea or dangerous if it doesn’t work out bc we work together. I know and I already dug that hole. it’s just to give context. 

So we can see what days we both work. What I do is look at the schedule, see what times/days we’re both off, and i make a mental note not to plan hangouts those days in case he asks me to hangout. Desperate I know. I don’t understand why he can’t do the same. We probably see each other once a week at work too but we aren’t always placed on positions next to each other so we don’t always get to talk. Also, I don’t consider that any kind of quality time. 

He was the one trying to ask me out for a month, tells me he really likes me, we get along well. He’s the one who tells everyone at work we’re together. My birthday and Valentine’s day are in the same month so 2 weeks ago for my birthday he bought me a crocheted doll of my favorite singer. I mentioned a month ago I wanted to go to an arcade and that’s where he took me for Valentine’s day a month later. For Valentine’s day he also made me mini clay versions of us, got me flowers and candy, and dropped by our work to get us drinks and showed all our coworkers the mini clay people. He just bragged to our coworkers last week abt these anime socks I gave him that came in late for Valentine’s day. He’s almost always down to hangout when I ask.  

I’ve already briefly mentioned this to him a few weeks ago. Granted I didn’t explicitly mention that I wanted basically most of our hangouts to be planned, just said I “wanted more planned dates.” He technically still has the rest of this week to plan one bc it’s Monday. We never talked about how many days a week we wanted to see each other. We’ve been doing day of planning for most of the 2 months even though I said 3 weeks ago I wanted more planning (I didn’t do it myself. It was a pride thing.) 

But I did mention it. I explicitly told him how it made me feel to wait by my phone all day hoping he wants to hangout. I said I wanted more planned hangouts. Also, he doesnt ask me like any questions abt me but I ask so many about him. I asked abt his family, his high school, his goals, his worries, and he’s only asked bc I just asked him. I’ve already talked to him about this and he said he just doesn’t think of those questions and doesn’t even ask his friends that stuff. I just don’t get how you wouldn’t want to know everything about me like I do you. 

So at this point, is it even worth mentioning the more explicit stuff like how many days a week, why he doesn’t check the schedule like I do, that I’d prefer a weeks notice of when we’re hanging out so I make plans around time together? The more concrete expectations. Or does this all sound stupid, we’re not a good fit, I’m getting played, and treated like a chess piece he can just move around all his other commitments. Or the opposite which I need to be more explicit with what I want and expect and I am being hasty.

But I don’t miss what it seems to inevitably lead to.  The wine tasting leads to the meh bottle of wine with dinner at home a couple of times a week.  The great whisky leads to Irish coffees with shit Costco brand 1.75s lasting only a week or two.  It all leads to drinking to excess when traveling in particular, including for work.  I’m slipped pretty badly on my diet and have gained a lot of weight since last December but drinking will just put me back to being straight up fat and will probably kill the fact that I am at least still lifting 2-3x a week.

So Im not sure if the above question makes sense, but let me explain. 

So not too long ago I went to the ER because of a scare I had with my heart. It’s happened before but not as bad as it did this one time I went to the ER. There will be this sudden pronounced discomfort in my chest with my heart, like “something changes” and itll happen spontaneously, and the last time it happened I instantly felt….funny. Not necessarily lightheaded but definitely woozy for a second and it hit me really hard. I went to the ER and my blood pressure was INSANE (160/118 I think with my heart rate at 185). Ive never seen those numbers before.

I saw my PCP recently who referred me to a cardiologist that I have yet to see, but she told me to monitor my BP twice a day. She gave me refills for my Propanolol and told me more testing needed to be done to figure out what was going on. She ordered a ton of bloodwork that I still need to go do. Ive been checking my BP since the appointment and its fucking insane. Just now I checked and its 158/97. Heart rate 98. I managed to lower my heart rate by breathing deeply but then it shoots back up again. 

They swore at the ER that I didnt have a heart attack but could what have happened damaged my heart? Ive never had BP this crazy until after that happened. The nuttiest I had ever seen before the ER was like 140/83. I dont drink, dont smoke, and only ever have one cup of coffee (but today I havent even had coffee, just one soda, 35mg of caffeine according to the can). Am I nuts or is this a plausible theory?

Side note: the fingertip of my left hand index finger was numb all day yesterday for no reason, it went away today but I just thought Id mention it because that was weird and ive been meaning to ask if its related ",1,1741057409.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I hope that you try to look into reading this book (Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki) to jumpstart your decluttering adventures.  
Obviously, don’t buy the book but borrow it from the library or use an app you see fit (e.g Hoopla, Libby, etc).  
This book gave me a lot of positive perspective on the impact of not having so much stuff or accumulating things. I have more fire to keep going.  While there may be some extreme examples of minimalism in this book, you must take what you want or pick and choose the best advice.  Some of Fumio’s advice might not even be attainable (e.g. not making coffee daily but instead going to a cafe).  

Some tidbits:
-Your stuff is like a roommate but you pay for their rent to be there.  
-You don’t need to stock up on stuff, the stores do that for you. 
-It’s okay if you spent a lot of money and haven’t used the item.  You’re probably not going to use it at all.  
-Your silent to-do list is effecting your mental health.  Things are “speaking” to you.  For example, those pants you bought that need to be hemmed… either donate it or hem them! 

You got this!  Slowly but surely!  Week by week!

He’s always been reactive to other dogs, but mainly responding when they bark first.

Over the last two months though he’s become increasingly aggressive. He growled at a woman at a coffee shop a back in December and I was SHOCKED. It was the first time he’d ever growled at a person, and that’s continued since then. 

He used to sniff people’s hands and let them pet him. I tried to board him a few days ago and he actually tried to bite the person. 

He’s also gotten WAY worse on the leash. 

There’s not way i can afford board and train and I feel irresponsible trying to rehome him knowing how unpredictable he’s become.

He was socialized as a puppy, daily walks exposed to plenty of stimuli, weekly dog park visits, etc. 

He’s becoming impossible to live with because I CANT take him out. I’m ranting but also looking for any advice.

I am currently looking for someone to move into my apartment in the Stamford Urby as I am planning to move into the city. I live in a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment on the fifth floor with a roommate (25M). 

For those who don’t know the Urby, it is a very nice apartment complex. The gym has everything you need to get a good workout (squat rack, cardio machines, free weights, weight machines, free space), the pool is amazing in the summer, the cafe is perfect for a morning coffee or weekend work session, and the study rooms are great too. 

I live with a roommate, he is 25, keeps everything very clean, and obviously I would introduce the two of you to make sure you are both comfortable living together before making any decisions. The rent is $3,495 plus $20 for trash and $75 for amenities. Water is typically $20/month and electric is normally anywhere between $90-$110. WiFi is $77.76/month. Each month breaks down to be about $1900 per person (includes rent, WiFi, water, electric, amenities, and trash), which is a great deal for Stamford, especially with how nice and new the Urby is (built in 2020) and how great the amenities are. 

I am looking to move into New York City and need someone to fill in for the remainder of my lease. The lease ends in January 2026. 

If you are interested, please reach out to me!! I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have.

I designed a box to store freshly roasted beans with a loose lid for degassing. Also added a grill at the bottom with 5 mm above to collect remaining chafes. Printed with PETG for food safety and always cool beans before storing in these boxes. 
Open to your comments and advice. ",8,1741056598.0,roasting,13,0.91,False

I’ve been a barista and a coffee lover for years, so when I got the chance to design a poster for a latte art competition, I put a ton of passion into it. Unfortunately, the café that commissioned it ended up not using it (long story), even though I was offering it at a really affordable price. They went with a different (ugly imo) design made by a friend of one of their employees instead.

I still really love how the poster turned out, and I’d hate for it to go to waste. It’s fully designed and ready to go and I can easily update the event details. If anyone here is organizing a latte art competition (or knows someone who is) and might be interested in buying it, let me know!

Also I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, apologies if it isn’t! If anyone can suggest where I might find someone interested, I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks! :)",0,1741056566.0,barista,0,0.33,False
