1ofaxo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSeattle/comments/1ofaxo9/soupy_desire/,Soupy desire,"Lately I’ve been thinking of soups a lot. For a city that sees a lot of rain there’s not a lot of soup spots. I’m sure there’s coffee spots every corner that offers its own vibe. Soup spots are a vibe too! 

Imagine a well known mom and pop / Seattle local or even just PNW only soup spots that open in major areas. Like how Dicks is to Seattle. 

You’re thinking what it would mean when it’s summer and nobody wants a hot piping soup anymore. I’m sure there are a lot of great cold soups with some nice gazpacho that would work great. 

Imagine how great of an option it would be to have dedicated soup spots in the city. Easy lunch idea and a great to store, pick up, distribute. Would be fresh for atleast a few days once in fridge so a really good option for later. And it’s easy to transport and make at one cloud kitchen and distribute. 

Why hasn’t one pursued this yet or has there been not enough evidence that this would work? Or someone tried in the past but never really got it to go anywhere? ",1,1761343763.0,AskSeattle,0,1.0,False

Ordered Red brick beans from squaremile coffee roasters. But realized after ordering that I got whole beans and not ground ones. Now my options are to either get them ground at a cafe or buy a cheap hand grinder. Which ones would you guys recommend?

For context, I'm an international student in the west midlands and used to make pourovers back home. My setup was quite simple- hario switch and baratza encore, with fellow kettle and timemore scale. Was exploring new ways to make coffee so got the moka pot. 

Any suggestions for how to make great coffee with a moka pot on induction would also be really helpful, I would mostly be making 1 cup for myself. Thanks in advance. ",1,1761343717.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False
1ofawjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1ofawjg/da_or_cptsd_related_discard/,DA or C-PTSD related Discard?,"Hey everyone, I’m (43M) and trying to process what happened with my ex (38F) when she suddenly called time on the relationship in early September.

We originally met about 18 months ago when my mum was admitted to, and sadly passed away in hospital, then reconnected earlier this year and started dating in March. 

I'd been single for a few months as had she. She'd been through a divorce two years or so ago after her husband had an affair. She eluded that some of the circumstances were traumatic but never divulged the full details to me.

Things moved gradually. Initially, we only saw each other every couple of weeks due to her work and childcare arrangements and communication wasn't to the level that I'd experienced in previous relationships.  We were in contact every day via message but this was the only means of communication as she didn't seem to be comfortable with phonecalls. She could be a little hot and cold, but we got on really well in person. There had been a few instances where she appeared to be struggling as well as occasions where she seemed to be distant but I put these down to general life stresses at the time.

By June, we’d introduced our kids and started spending more time together. She posted about us on social media, commenting that her life was changing, and everything seemed positive. I started to invite her to family gatherings, occasions etc and she integrated easily. Then, after a short break abroad in August, she suddenly became distant and said she didn’t know what she wanted. It completely blindsided me.

She said she'd struggled with the affection whilst we were away and asked for space. Communication became strained and she was cold and dismissive. A week later she said she’d had “a wobble,” and things seemed to return to normality. I was relieved, but what had gone on had made me really anxious. Then, a couple of days after a trip away for her birthday, she flipped cold again.

I told her that her hot and cold behaviour was impacting me and she said that it wasn't her responsibility. I said that I wanted us both to feel secure in the relationship, asked for a little bit more effort from her in terms of initiating communication, and some reassurance that things would continue to progress, appreciating it would take time. This is when things spiralled.

She said she was struggling to fit everything in, she didn't know if she was suited to a full on relationship, that she was very independent for good reason, implied that I was impacting her time with her child and her ability to parent, she didn't like to text all the time, that there were too many things to address, it wasn't going to work, and she needed to focus on herself.

She added that she had thought she could try to be in another relationship but she just couldn't manage it and that she'd probably feel that way for a long time yet. She later proceeded to throw my kindness back in my face in spectacular fashion by saying that one of the main reasons for wanting end things was me turning up at her workplace and home unannounced. Just to put this into context, I have done this on a handful of occasions with the best of intentions. I took her coffee and breakfast into work on one occasion when she was struggling and shopping when she was doing back-to-back shifts. I delivered her birthday card and present to her home on her birthday, took her flowers after her dog passed away and took her son a toy when he was unwell.

I tried to reason with her, be accommodating, offered solutions and suggested meeting in person to have a discussion. She refused, said she couldn't talk about it right now, she was busy getting her hair done, had plans that evening, and that was basically it. Ghosted after 6 months. 

I tried to make contact a couple more times to arrange exchange of each other's possessions and express my dismay but got ignored and blocked.

I’ve never experienced anything like it. The sudden emotional switch and total lack of closure have left me reeling. I’ve dealt with a tough breakup before, but this one feels worse and I'm emotionally destroyed. I cannot phantom how you can be in a relationship with someone for 6 months, be fairly involved in each others lives, dump them via text and essentially disappear.

Can anyone relate to this kind of discard? Was this avoidant behavior, trauma response, or something else entirely?",1,1761343678.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False
1ofawd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1ofawd4/aita_for_going_low_contact_with_my_oldest_sister/,AITA for going low contact with my oldest sister after she exposed herself for supporting someone who assaulted me?,"I (35f) and my sister (39f) have had a very interesting relationship. When I became a teenager and my parents divorced we got really close, almost like best friends. We did a lot of partying together, concerts and events etc. 
What’s important to note here is a reoccurring issue that shows its ugly head every so often. My oldest sister let’s call her Joanna, would often accuse her partners of being interested in me to the point of having full blown domestics in front of me. This happened 3 times with the last incident being the most major; I was in my early 20s and moved to Alberta for the summer to live w her - she begged me to take a weekend off to hangout w her and her bf and after a few drinks accused him of wanting to spicy sleep me and locked me out of her apartment aka my home for the entire evening. I had to find somewhere else to stay in a province I was new to with little resources as a student.

I ended up getting knocked up when I was 24 and Joanna and my relationship was rocky af. I often had to take space from her and I felt we often were engaged in emotionally charged conversations. Joanna was in a new relationship (her now husband) and they had just gotten a puppy. Lovely for them. She proceeded to go on and on about how much she loves her puppy and how I must love my son the same. I get it, she’s trying to connect I guess? But as a single mom who had to flip my entire life around, work two jobs taking public transit and doing dr appts all by myself.. I felt like wth is wrong with this person to dismiss me and my experience so casually? Pet parents out there : it’s not the same thing as giving birth to a child. I responded to her saying that I could run her dog over with a car and she couldn’t do that to my baby so no it wasn’t the same thing but thanks so much for reaching out. 

Fast forward to today - the straw that broke the camels back happened this summer. We all have an estranged relationship with my dad, I am the only person that attempts a relationship w him (for the past 15 years) and he’s been very damaging to my mental health. I didn’t invite my dad to my wedding in June but made plans to see him in early August. I took my family; husband and son, 3 hours away to see him. We booked a hotel for 2 nights (it wasn’t cheap) and planned to have day and evening plans w him. Day plans went great with a little awkwardness. We went back to our hotel to change and grab the groceries for dinner because my dad claims to not have a penny to his name and when we got to his place he was drinking. He proceeded to chain smoke and go off on tangents about various conspiracy theories without taking a breath. This is typical for him but has been getting worse over the years and I’ve tried many times to set boundaries with him which he joyfully crosses every time. He sat down at the dinner table and asked my son if they’re teaching him to be transgender and that’s when I stood up and said we are NOT talking about this. I also work in the school board and he has no interest in asking ME anything he just wants to spew his venom without recourse. My dad threw his drink AT me, in front of my son and husband and then continues to grab various items off his desk and whip them at me. He then put his hands on my shoulders and shoved me from the kitchen to the door screaming in my face while my son is bawling his eyes out. My husband shoved him off me and told him not to touch me and then I collected my son’s belongings and told him he would not hear from us again. My son cried for 3 hours straight afterwards. I told my mom, stepdad and sisters right away. 

Fast forward to the end of August when Joanna , my autistic sister, my son and myself go camping. Joanna mentioned the incident and I casually express how wild it all was without saying too much and she tells me that she feels bad for him and he told her my husband broke his glasses when he shoved him so she offered to pay for them. I was shocked. Here’s the thing, Joanna has a lot to offer but money is not one of them. She’s claimed bankruptcy twice, doesn’t file her taxes and constantly is “borrowing” money from my mom and grandma. I expressed to her “that’s a fn weird thing to do, why would you do that?” And she was like “omg, are we really doing this here?” And I said “no, no we’re not” and I packed up my stuff and went back to the campsite and we didn’t speak for the rest of the evening. The next morning I went and got coffee for everyone, packed up our stuff and away we went. She sent me a text message a little later maybe a week or so basically saying she was a little tipsy and doesn’t really remember but I sure do. She didn’t actually NEED to tell me she was going to pay for his glasses, if she even ever does, I truly believe she said it to strike a nerve in me purposefully. I would normally react pretty brutally to something like this but at this point in my life I just feel like people who are not FOR me, are not for me and that’s ok. Joanna asked if I ever wanted to grab a coffee and talk about the incident (with my dad) that she would love to but I have no interest in speaking to her further about an experience that was not hers that she’s already made an opinion about.
I spoke to my mom and she told me not to talk to her about it anymore which I respect, but this is a relationship ending experience for me. I’m not the type of person to be nice to save face or whatever the case. I will have firm boundaries around her access to me and I absolutely will not be hugging her which I think are fair and reasonable. When she is around for family gatherings  (which is few and far in between because she’s somehow always working with no money) I have every intention to talk and participate in conversation in a nice way. But, I don’t plan on addressing her in the family group chat and I don’t plan on sharing my life with her. She would never ask to hangout or see my son, but if she did I would say yes. He’s 10 now though so I think we can expect the trend of absence to continue.

1ofashd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrowverse/comments/1ofashd/au_story_the_violet_knight_part_4/,AU Story: The Violet Knight Part 4,"The Titans had returned to the Tower, the stolen Pharaoh’s Ruby recovered, but the energy in the room was tense. Victor was already working the main terminal, running scans across Blüdhaven for any residual signal from Selina's customized armor.

​On the main monitor, the faces of Team Flash, Team Arrow, Clark, and Lois watched the debrief via video link.

​Dick Stood with his posture conveying deep concern, ""She was prepared for everything. Kori's starbolts were dampened by a lead-composite lining. Vic’s EMP was useless against an analog network. Rachel's power was blocked by a psychic white-noise emitter. And Gar was disabled by a targeted frequency pulse.""

​Clark with his voice calm but strained from Metropolis, ""How could she know how to counter all those specific abilities? That's not common tech, Dick.""

​Dick meets Clark’s gaze on the screen, ""It wasn’t Selina’s tech. It was Bruce’s contingency. When I asked her how she knew our weaknesses, she said she learned things while being with Bruce, like how to take all the heroes down. That armor was designed to neutralize any powered threat Bruce considered an Omega-level risk.""

​A heavy silence descended over the comms. The idea that Bruce Wayne, their ally, their friend, had built fail-safes capable of systematically dismantling them sent a wave of unease through the League and the Teams.

​Laurel spoke quietly, ""He had plans to take us out? All of us?""

​Barry sighed, ""It’s… it’s the Batman way, I guess. Prepared for the worst-case scenario. But having it used against us by a thief he once loved is another thing entirely.""

​Sara cuts through the tactical talk, focusing on her daughter. ""Dick, hold the debrief. How’s Ellie? She had a massive emotional shock.""

​Dick glanced across the room, Ellie was curled up on a corner of the couch, still in her clothes, clutching the plushies. She looked exhausted but strangely calm.

Dick looks back towards the screen, ​""She's fine, Sara. Physically, she’s fine. Emotionally… She took three years of suppressed anger and grief and emptied it right onto Selina. She told her that you're her real mother, and Selina was just the egg donor.""

​The collective silence this time was one of stunned consensus.

​Cisco broke the silence, whispering, ""Damn.""

Caitlin nodded slowly,  ""Well, that settles that, catharsis delivered.""

​Sara let out a slow, deep exhale, ""Okay. Thank you, Dick. Keep her close. We'll run a counter-analysis on Bruce's tech and try to figure out what Selina's up too. Call me if she even sneezes.""

​Dick ended the call and walked over to the couch, gently sitting beside Ellie. He placed a steady hand on her back. ""Hey. How are you doing, El? Be honest with me.""

​Ellie shifted, leaning her head back against the cushion, gazing up at the ceiling. ""I’m alright. Empty, mostly. It was nice to finally scream the truth at her, you know? The real reason I drove here last night in my pajamas wasn't just to see you guys. It's because... I’ve always wanted to live here. I wanted to get to hang out with all of you every day. If Dad didn't die, I think I would have moved here after graduation. These past three years, I’ve missed getting to see my big brother whenever I wanted because I didn't have to worry about anything. I had no job before that night. I love you, I love Kori, with Rachel, Gar, and Victor being awesome and wonderful friends. It just sucks I can only be out of Gotham for only a weekend at a time.""

​She looked at Dick, her eyes pleading. ""I'm the CEO, Dick. I have the resources, the cars, the name, but my life is still stuck in Gotham, surrounded by ghosts and responsibility. I just want the life I see here.""

​Dick squeezed her shoulder, understanding the heartbreaking simplicity of her wish.

​""I know, El. And we love having you here. We just need to finish this fight and get Red X off the board. Then maybe we can figure out a way to give you more than just a weekend.”

The exhaustion from the morning’s fight and the brutal confrontation with Selina had finally caught up to Ellie. She was soundly asleep in the bedroom the Titans had set up for her, curled up beneath the covers in her pajamas. The Titans Tower was silent, the silence of a house where the inhabitants feel safe.

​Ellie stirred, her eyes fluttering open slightly as a light, warm pressure settled near her face. Something soft and covered in tan and green fur was gently nudging her cheek.

​It was Gar, in the smallest of his forms, a tiny, purring kitten. He gave a soft, high-pitched meow, his golden eyes wide and concerned. He had checked in on her non-verbally, knowing that after an emotional crash, she needed stillness.

​Ellie smiled, a fragile, genuine expression of comfort. She pulled the little kitten onto her chest, tucking him beneath her chin. Gar immediately began to purr, a rhythmic, rumbling sound that vibrated gently against her skin.

​She closed her eyes again, the sound of her friend’s quiet affection a perfect antidote to the rage and pain she had expelled hours earlier. She hadn't realized how tense she still was until the soft, loving weight of Gar’s purring lulled her back to sleep. She was safe, she was loved, and for the first time in a long time, she was truly at home.

Also that night in the abandoned warehouse in Blüdhaven's Industrial District, Selina was seething, pacing beside her discarded purple armor, her voice a low snarl of fury. ""She's weak, she’s sentimental, and she thinks she can walk away from Gotham! I gave her life! I gave her purpose! I gave her—""

A Calm, slightly filtered, ""She gave you a choice. And you chose the heist.""

​Selina spun around, facing the figure of Red X. ""I don't need your advice. I need to make her, and that interfering Canary, pay for the disrespect.""

​Red X chuckled, ""Exactly. And I need a few more items to finish my work, specifically, something capable of bypassing the advanced network defenses that Wayne Enterprises and S.T.A.R. Labs are now building. You have the knowledge of Bruce's countermeasures; I have the resources, the motivation, and the mobility.""

​He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.

""Let's help each other. You handle the emotional destruction, and I'll handle the theft. Together, we can teach Ellie Wayne exactly what happens when you turn your back on Gotham.""

​Selina studied him, her sharp gaze calculating. ""Partnerships require trust, Red X. You’ve seen my face. You know my capabilities, and you know who my enemies are. I don’t deal with ghosts."" She folded her arms. ""Who are you, really?""

​Red X paused, the air thick with anticipation. He reached up and pulled the mask off, revealing the scarred, intense face of a young man with a familiar, burning resentment in his eyes. ""My name is Grant Wilson. The Son of Deathstroke.""

​Selina's eyes widened momentarily, the surprise genuine. The name was instantly recognizable to anyone in Bruce Wayne's inner circle. a lineage of assassins and enemies of the Titans. ""Bruce Wayne ruined my father. Dick Grayson ruined my potential. And the League ruined my family. I am here to dismantle every last piece of the heroes' legacy, starting with the source of their power, and ending with the heart of the Bat-Family.""

​He held the mask in his hand, the glowing red X staring at the horrified Catwoman. ""Do we have a deal, Selina?""

Selina recovered quickly, the calculating coldness returning to her eyes. She smiled with a predatory, terrible smile. ""A deal, Grant. Let's make Gotham burn.”

In the late afternoon the following day, the sun filtered through the dense trees surrounding Felicity Smoak’s secluded house. She pulled her car into the long, winding driveway, the quiet solitude of the forest a welcome antidote to the frantic energy of Queen Consolidated.

She paused before walking up the steps, her heart softening at the sight on her porch. Her daughter, Mia, was curled up on the porch swing, wearing a comfortable emerald green t-shirt, black sweats, and matching emerald green socks. Beside her was Ellie, still incredibly relaxed after her nap, wearing her pajamas and bunny slippers. The only sign that she was a multi-billionaire CEO battling super-thieves was the silver gleam of her temporal watch resting loosely on her wrist.

​The two girls were deep in conversation, Mia idly swinging their feet, Ellie occasionally pulling a knee up to her chest. Their laughter drifted softly through the calm air. Felicity just watched, leaning against the doorframe. She quietly pulled out her phone, switching to the video camera, wanting to capture the rare, precious normalcy of the moment.

​Mia laughed, ""He was such a pain, though. Seriously. Dad had to do everything himself. Always in the corner, judging all our brightly colored costumes.""

​Ellie smiled slightly, ""Sounds like my Dad. He was the ultimate brooding expert. I think he took lessons. But your dad was more... loud about his disapproval. Mine just stared, which was worse.""

​Mia smiled, ""Oh, they hated each other’s methods. Dad thought Bruce was unnecessarily theatrical, and Bruce thought Dad was reckless.""

​Ellie smiled, ""Yeah, the rivalry was legendary. But honestly, I think they did have a weird kind of respect for each other. When it truly mattered, when they put on the costumes and needed to save people. They could trust each other completely. They were the two guys who would never, ever quit.""

​Mia nodded thoughtfully. ""Yeah, I saw it in Dad's journals. He’d complain about a Wayne Tech gadget, but he’d still rely on it. They were opposites, but they were the same kind of broken.""

​""Right. And they agreed on one huge thing, Mia. One massive, undeniable thing."" said Ellie.

​Mia looked up, curious, ""What's that?""

​Ellie looked down at the pajamas and then back at the soft, comforting green of Mia’s shirt, the colors of their fractured families. She spoke softly, her voice filled with deep certainty. ""Both our dads loved their little girls more than anything else in the entire universe. That’s why they were fighting.""

​Mia’s tough exterior melted into a small, wistful smile. ""Yeah. I guess they did.""

​Felicity took a few quick pictures, capturing the light in their eyes, and then stopped the video feed. She pushed off the doorframe, walking forward to hug both girls tight.

​""They certainly did. And that, my sweethearts, is the contingency plan they never bothered to write down.""

​This quiet, grounding moment reminds the heroes what they are fighting for: the chance for these two girls to finally live the lives they deserve. Felicity took one last, long look at the peaceful scene before heading inside. She immediately pulled up the video she had just recorded, quickly sending the media to the collective hero chat, labeling it: ""Proof of Concept: When we win, this is what we save.""

​Ellie and Mia settled back onto the swing, a comfortable silence lingering after Felicity went inside. Ellie fiddled with the temporal watch on her wrist, her expression suddenly shifting to one of intense seriousness.

​Ellie leaned  forward slightly, lowering her voice, ""Okay, Mia. I have to ask you a truly important question.""

​Mia matched her serious tone, ""Hit me, El. After all the Bat-drama and the dead dads, I can handle anything. Is it a secret about the League? Is it about Red X?""

​Ellie spoke in a very serious, intense whisper, ""Do you like Pokémon?""

​Mia stared at her for a beat, processing the gravity of the question's delivery against the utter ridiculousness of its content. Then, she threw her head back and burst out laughing, a clear, genuine sound that echoed through the quiet woods.

​Mia wiped a tear from her eye, still chuckling, ""Oh my god, Ellie! You’re unbelievable. Yes! Of course, I like Pokémon! I grew up on it!""

​Ellie beamed, suddenly energized, ""Thank goodness. I was worried this alliance was going to fall apart before it even started.""

​MIA: ""Don't worry, El. You had me at bunny slippers. My favorite is Decidueye. The spooky owl archer? That’s my whole vibe.""

​Ellie smiled, ""Solid choice. Great stealth, excellent moveset. I've been thinking about this a lot since I got back from Blüdhaven, and I'm looking to build a team...""

​Ellie paused, letting her eyes land on the green of Mia's shirt, the color of her own pajamas, and the memory of Gar's purring kitten. ""...not a battle team, or a defense team. I'm building a team... of best friends who love Pokémon.""

​Mia smiled, nudging Ellie with her shoulder. ""We're already halfway there, El. Welcome home.""

Ellie and Mia were still laughing over the idea of a ""team of best friends who love Pokémon."" The porch swing creaked softly beneath them.

​Ellie spoke calmly, but with a familiar scheming glint in her eye, ""Okay, new topic. Even more important than Decidueye's optimal move set.""

​Mia matched her tone, ""Go for it, El. I'm ready for the next level of seriousness.""

​Ellie asked, ""Do you know how to drive?""

​Mia answered, ""I have my learner's permit, but no car. Unless you count the beat-up farm truck we use to haul dirt, but I don't think my mom would appreciate me driving that onto a highway.""

​Ellie leaned in, a conspiratorial smirk spreading across her face. Her hand instinctively went to the temporal watch on her wrist. ""Permit is all I need. Would you like to go for a drive? A really quick, fun drive?""

​Before Mia could even answer, the air in front of the porch swing shimmered and tore open. A perfectly circular, electric-blue portal materialized, revealing a slice of the sleek, grey, high-tech interior of the Titans Tower garage.

​Mia stared, jaw slightly dropped, ""You brought your watch. You absolute lunatic.""

​Ellie smirked, ""I'm the CEO, Mia. I'm always prepared. Come on.""

​They walked through the portal. They found themselves instantly in the hushed, cavernous garage. Ellie walked quickly to the counter, grabbed the keys to the Supra, and tossed them to Mia.

​Mia caught the keys instinctively, ""Wait, where are we going?""

​Ellie ignored the question, walking straight to the Supra’s trunk. She pulled out a small duffel bag, unzipped it, and took out a pair of plush, black slippers and handed the black slippers to Mia.

""Rule number one of Wayne-Mobile joyrides: you must wear appropriate footwear."" She closed the trunk, walked around to the passenger side, and looked at Mia. ""There’s a custom car dealership in Blüdhaven that deals only in heavily modified imports. They’re closed, but I own the building, so they’re actually open. Ready?""

​Mia was already climbing into the driver’s seat. She turned the key. The Supra roared into life, a deep, satisfying tremor running through the garage floor. Mia grinned, revving the engine just to hear the sound, making them both laugh again. Ellie opened a second, new portal directly onto a quiet backstreet in Blüdhaven.

​Mia didn’t hesitate. She accelerated, feeling the instantaneous grip of the custom tires, and rocketed through the portal. 

The drive was everything Ellie had promised: quick and agile, weaving through the late afternoon traffic with the sort of precision and speed Mia could only dream of achieving in the Arrow suit. She felt the power beneath her hands, controlling the beast with surprising confidence.

​They arrived at the dealership minutes later, leaving the Supra parked discreetly. They walked through the pristine lot, past polished Ferraris and Lamborghinis.

Mia stopped dead, her eyes wide with excitement. ""THAT ONE!"" she yelled, happily running toward a particular car.

​It was a magnificent Porsche 911, heavily customized with a huge GT spoiler, a pronounced splitter, and painted in a stunning, two-tone emerald green and matte black paint job. It was fast, elegant, and screamed ‘Arrow’ heritage.

​Ellie smiled, knowing she had made the perfect choice, ""She looks nice. She looks very you. Let’s get it.”

Felicity was outside her house, scrolling through the Titans chat feed, frowning slightly. Muttering to ""Where did those girls run off to? They were right here...""

​As she spoke, a temporal portal tore open violently about ten feet in front of her driveway. The roar of a turbocharged engine instantly deafened her. ​Driving out of the electric-blue tear in space was Mia, behind the wheel of the gorgeous, green and black Porsche. She slammed on the brakes, the car skidding perfectly to a halt on the gravel.

​Mia burst out of the driver's seat, her face glowing with pure, unadulterated joy. Cheering loudly, throwing her arms up, ""MOM! LOOK WHAT ELLIE BOUGHT ME! I HAVE A CAR!""

Ellie emerged a second later from the passenger side, giving Felicity a serene, unapologetic wave. Felicity was reeling from the sight of her daughter driving a brand-new, customized Porsche through a temporal portal. Mia and Ellie were both standing by the sleek, emerald green car, admiring the new GT spoiler and laughing at the absurdity of the situation.

​Mia was running a hand over the matte black hood, still buzzing with excitement. ""I can't believe this is mine. You're the best, El.""

​Ellie shrugged with a playful smile. ""Just the perk of being best friends with a CEO. Now we just need to figure out where we can find a matching Decidueye sticker.""

​Felicity, having processed the chaos, sighed dramatically but couldn't help the maternal warmth spreading through her chest. She grabbed her phone again, snapping a picture of the two girls, their faces bright with happiness beside the ridiculously expensive car.

​She immediately opened the hero group chat, sending the image of Mia's new ride with an accompanying text message.

​FELICITY (To Group Chat):
""Look what I have to deal with now? A 17 year old driving a Porsche!!!!!!""

Felicity was still shaking her head in amused disbelief as she stepped inside, leaving the girls by the newly acquired Porsche. Muttering to herself, ""I have a teenager who has a Porsche, thanks to the twenty-two year old who is wearing Flash pajamas. I need to sit down.""

​Mia, sensing her mom had retreated, looked at Ellie with a mischievous glint in her eye. ""Hey, El, there's a lot of open space here in Oregon. Plus, my mom’s got great tracking software, but it only tracks things she knows exist.""

​Ellie immediately understood. She casually touched the temporal watch on her wrist, inputting the coordinates and the target signature. With a faint blue shimmer, the air in Felicity’s driveway warped, and the roar of a turbocharged engine announced the arrival of the custom Supra.

​The second car was now parked neatly beside the Porsche.

​Inside the House Felicity walked into her kitchen and pulled a glass down from the cupboard, reaching for a bottle of wine. She needed this, she rubbed her forehead. ""I have a teenager who has a Porsche.""

​Before she could pour the wine, the combined, deafening roar of two high-powered sports cars, the deep burble of the Porsche and the sharp metallic howl of the Supra, shook the quiet house.

​Felicity dropped her hand and sprinted back outside, a wave of familiar, panicked parental stress washing over her. She saw Mia in the driver’s seat of the Porsche and Ellie in the Supra, both cars idling, exhaust fumes rising softly into the woods.

​The girls gave her matching, innocent smiles, and then, in a synchronized burst of speed, they drove out of the driveway and were gone. ​Felicity stood for a moment, letting out a massive exhale. She walked back inside, grabbed her phone, and tapped the screen, immediately dialing the one person who could truly understand this unique flavor of chaos.

​In the Lance-Sharp Condo, Sara & Ava were sitting on her sleek white couch with Laurel & Thea, enjoying a quiet moment with coffee and catching up. Her phone rang, displaying Felicity’s name. 

Sara put it on speaker. ""Hey, Felicity, what’s up? Did Vic get the anti-contingency software running?""

​Felicity's voice was artificially calm, like a thin layer of ice over boiling water, ""Your daughter.""

​Sara rubbed her forehead. ""Oh, what did she do now? Did she accidentally make a clone or is she eating pizza too close to the temporal drive?""

​Felicity’s calm cracking, ""No. Our daughters! Our daughters Sara! Are currently driving their high-powered sports cars, which Ellie bought, to who knows where!""

​Thea and Laurel exchanged wide-eyed looks of amusement. Ava quietly moved closer to the speaker.

​Sara waved a dismissive hand, still calm, ""Relax, Felicity. Ellie's a safe driver. She's been dodging speedsters and rogue drones since she was sixteen. They're fine.""

​Felicity said bluntly, her voice rising to a strained shout, “Sara, do you really believe they won't try to see who's faster?! Your speedster-adjacent daughter versus a car enthusiast with an Arrow mentality?!""

​The line went silent. Sara’s hand paused as she finally considered the horrific logic of the situation: a race between the highly competitive daughters of Batman and Green Arrow in custom sports cars.

​Sara muttered, pinching the bridge of her nose, ""Okay. Okay, that's a valid concern. I'll call Dick and have him send Gar, no, Victor, to track them. Just... try not to worry."" Sara disconnected the call and looked at the three women staring at her.

Thea smirked, “I don't why Felicity's shocked this is what happens when two rich “wild child” kids are friends.”

​Ava said with a deadpan look, ""I guess we're back to prioritizing the rescue of the 'Best Friends Pokémon Team' over Red X.""

What were usually the quiet, tranquil roads of rural Oregon now echoed with the furious, mechanical roar of two high-powered sports cars. The sleek, emerald green Porsche and the aggressive, metallic Supra were locked in a high-speed dance, leaving twin plumes of dust behind them on a clear dirt road.

​Felicity’s fears had been instantly realized. Ellie and Mia were doing exactly what their competitive genetics dictated, seeing who was faster. The thrill was exhilarating, a wild, kinetic release of all the pressure and grief they had been holding onto. They pushed the limits, the custom tires gripping the loose earth, neither one wanting to lose to the other’s legacy.

​Mia felt the raw, responsive power of the Porsche beneath her hands, pushing it through corners with an instinctive precision that would have made Oliver proud. Ellie, equally aggressive, kept pace in the Supra, using its lighter frame and agility to hold the lead.

​Thankfully, their attention was instantly snapped back to reality as they approached the highway. Immediately, the heavy foot came off the accelerator. The two powerful engines eased into a civilized purr, and the girls smoothly merged into traffic, obeying the speed limit like the good heroes they were.

​They came to a stop side-by-side at a red light. Ellie looked across the passenger seat at Mia, who was breathless but beaming. Ellie then glanced at the GPS on her Supra's screen, noting the city limits of Portland ahead.

​Ellie leaned over, lowering her voice conspiratorially, ""Hey, Mia.""

​Mia looked over catching her breath, ""Yeah, El?""

​A wide, confident smirk spreading across Ellie's face, ""There's a dedicated racetrack in Portland. It's only about an hour away. Let's make this legal.""

​Mia’s smile widened, her eyes lighting up with approval. ""I like the way you think, Batgirl.""

​The green light dropped, and they accelerated, heading toward the professional track where they could truly unleash the power of their cars.

Felicity was pacing a severe groove in her kitchen floor, the glass of wine she’d poured now abandoned on the counter. She’d barely hung up with Sara when a familiar blue shimmer filled her living room.

​Sara stepped out of the temporal portal, followed closely by Ava, Laurel & Thea.

​Felicity threw her hands up, ""Thank God! You’re here! They’re gone, Sara! They drove off! Two young girls, two customized street-racing machines, and a Learner’s Permit! This is worse than the time Roy stole the Arrow car! At least that thing was designed not to break!""

​Sara calmly walked over and picked up the wine glass, ""Take a breath, Felicity. We tracked them. They’re heading toward Portland International Raceway. They’re not joyriding, they’re doing it legally.""

​Thea grinned, leaning against the counter, ""You know, I’m kind of proud. When I was sixteen, I only had a beat-up pickup truck to drive illegally. Mia’s doing it in style. Did you see that spoiler? Pure aggression.""

​Felicity wailed, ""It’s not style, it’s liability! Ellie used the temporal watch! She just warped the Supra from the Titans garage into my driveway! I’m going to have to explain this to the League, to the board, to—""

​Laurel stepped in, placing a comforting hand on Felicity’s shoulder, ""Hey. Look at it this way, Fee. They’re not doing what their dads would do, brooding and hiding the cars. They’re doing what we taught them to do: committing to the problem and having fun while doing it. They had a huge emotional release today. This is how they blow off steam. It’s better than using the temporal watch to prevent the QFS from ever being invented.""

​Sara took a sip of the wine,""Laurel’s right. And think about it, they are going to a professional track. That’s growth. They are proving they can handle the power, whether it's the weight of the legacy or the horsepower of the car. We can monitor them without them knowing. They need this.""

​Felicity took a deep, shaky breath, she finally managed a small, watery smile. ""I guess... I guess you're right. Now, whose turn is it to buy the popcorn?""

At ​Portland International Raceway, the air vibrated with the smell of high-octane fuel and burning rubber. Ellie and Mia had successfully signed the necessary paperwork (likely utilizing Ellie’s ownership of several shell companies that ""sponsor"" the track) and were now lined up at the starting grid on a clear, sunny stretch of asphalt.

​Mia, tense and focused in the driver’s seat of the emerald-green Porsche, gave a sharp nod. This was different from the dusty backroads, this was about precision and professional speed. The car felt like an extension of her own focused, archery-honed mind.

​Ellie, beside her in the metallic Supra, was grinning with exhilaration. Her hands gripped the steering wheel, anticipating the launch. ​The official starter, oblivious to the fact that one driver was the heiress to the Arrow legacy and the other was a temporal-hopping CEO, dropped the flag.

​The Supra and the Porsche launched simultaneously, their custom engines screaming in harmony. Mia immediately demonstrated the Porsche’s superior cornering, taking the first turn with incredible, controlled aggression, hugging the inner curb line like an expert. She pulled half a car length ahead, her eyes fixed on the apex.

​Ellie pushed the Supra on the straightaway, letting the twin turbos unleash pure, brutal speed. She used the Bat-trained focus of calculated risk, drafting expertly behind the Porsche before swinging out wide on the back stretch, regaining the lead by mere inches. 

The two cars were practically glued together, a flashing purple and green blur tearing down the track.

​The race was tight, clean, and aggressive. They were driving each car to its absolute limit, a thrilling display of controlled power and competitiveness that matched the rivalry of their fathers. On the final turn, the two cars dove into the curve neck and neck. They straightened out onto the final straight, engines roaring in a desperate final surge.

​They crossed the finish line in a dead heat.

​Both girls slammed on the brakes, laughing and shouting as they pulled into the pit area. They climbed out, rushing to meet in the middle of the track.

Mia was breathless, pushing her hair back, ""You are insane, El! I thought I had you on the hairpin!""

​Ellie was elated, giving Mia a hard high-five, ""I know! You drive like a genius, Mia! The Supra is faster, but your lines are perfect! That was the best day I've had in three years!”

As Ellie and Mia were laughing, still catching their breath from the high-octane race, they were entirely oblivious to the small, barely visible object hovering silently overhead. A tiny, insect-sized drone, a piece of reconnaissance tech used by Grant, was relaying a live video feed directly to the Blüdhaven warehouse.

​In the warehouse, Selina Kyle watched the monitor, where the two girls were celebrating their tie in front of a custom Porsche and a Supra.

​Selina watched curiously, a slight smirk playing on her lips, ""Hey, Grant! Get over here.""

​Grant walked across the cold concrete floor, stopping beside her. ""What is it?"" he asked, his voice still filtered through his suit's comms.

​Selina motioned to the screen ""Look who decided to pop up on a Blüdhaven affiliate feed. It’s the little CEO and her best friend, Mia Queen, daughter of Oliver Queen. Looks like they’ve been celebrating their newfound friendship with some highly illegal joyriding.""

​Grant’s devious smirk intensified behind his mask. The name 'Queen' registered instantly, linking the current threat directly to the broader superhero community that had haunted his father. ""Queen, eh? That’s convenient. Another hero legacy, ripe for the pruning. Well, we should see if Mia can shoot an arrow like her pops. Or perhaps,"" he added, looking at the two powerful sports cars on the screen, ""if she can drive better than him when the stakes are real.""",1,1761343380.0,Arrowverse,0,1.0,False

I (32f) work at a local hospital unit. My coworker (24f) joined roughly at the same time than me. At first I didn’t think anything out of the ordinary from her but now I feel like I had enough. Every day she comes to work talking about how guys flirt with her all the time and how “shy she is”. The other day she told us how some guy asked for her name at the hospital reception because he “talked to her on the hospital switch phone once and could recognise her voice “ and how “weird” that was. I told her that would be weird if he asked for her number and tried to get more info out of her, I think he was probably being friendly and not everyone is trying to get their ways with her. I am all about defending women from harassment but I am not into feeding someone’s ego. She is young and has blonde hair and distinctive features that are pretty but not like an irresistible goddess look and tbh where we live, every female looks like her.

On one occasion I told her how a guy at the cafe likes to flirt but he is definitely so bad at it and how he gave me a free coffee but I said it as a funny thing because I don’t care, Im married so a tiny flirt will not scare me and her reaction was so strange, she kinda got upset and responded “I thought he was only flirting with me” she then looked at me like “with you??” Like who the hell would flirt with a 30yo 😂 I told her sorry to let her know but he flirts with the entire hospital, men and women so I guess she isn’t that special after all. 

To me it is such an egotistical thing to just go around and say “this guy must have a crush on me” or “our boss told me someone asked for my name and if I have a bf” I don’t know maybe I am wrong and she gets heaps of attention but the time we have to invest listening to it is just unnecessary. Also she’s got a bf since high-school and to me is just a bit weird to get all red and shy because a guy said hi to her specially when she is in a committed relationship.",1,1761343239.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

So I started tracking everything with my ring, especially my HRV which was desperately stuck around 40-45ms, a clear sign that my autonomic nervous system wasn't at its best and my recovery was poor.

The first thing the data showed was the impact of my lunches, especially the carbs that were obviously knocking me out, so I started to completly rethink my daily energy intake. After figuring out my baseline expenditure with a [TDEE Calculator](https://lean-app.com/en/tdee-calculator/) to get a precise idea of my actual needs, I adjusted my macros to favor fats and proteins for lunch, and I saw an almost immediate diference in my afternoon focus, the post-meal drowsiness was gone.

At the same time I quit caffeine after 1pm and replaced it with a L-theanine (200mg) and caffeine (100mg) combo in the morning, which was a real game changer for me, it gave me a much smoother energy without the anxiety spike that coffee alone could sometimes cause, while preserving my sleep quality at night.

End results after two months of this protocol, my average HRV is now between 60 and 65ms, my deep sleep has increased by almost 25% and the most important thing is that I don't have any energy slumps anymore, just a stable mental clarity throughout the day which is pretty amazing to experience.

So my final stack is a cyclical ketogenic diet well-calibrated to my needs, the L-theanine/caffeine duo in the morning and no more screens an hour before bed, it's simple but the cumulative effect has been huge for me and I hope this feedback can help some people who are in the same strugle.",1,1761342907.0,Biohackers,1,0.67,False

I’ve been hosting for over a year now, and I could use some perspective.

My property is a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom house (around 180 sqm), fully equipped and designed for comfort with a new furniture,interior design,fresh ironed linens and towels, a well-stocked kitchen with coffee, tea, and spices, bathrooms with body and hair care products, even small extra kits like toothbrushes, toothpaste, and a ladies’ box. Basically, I try to make it feel like a boutique-style stay rather than a standard rental.

However, lately I’ve been noticing more low-quality or mismatched guests.. even during aurora season. The issue, I think, is that most travelers in my area come in small groups or couples, while my house can easily accommodate 9–10 people. Naturally, that makes my price point higher, which seems to discourage smaller groups.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on How can I make my rental more visible or appealing to families and groups of friends?

Should I adjust my pricing strategy,maybe start using dynamic pricing tools?

Or is it better to create group-focused packages or discounts to fill the space more efficiently?

1ofalpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ofalpy/emotional_cheated_and_divorce/,Emotional cheated and divorce,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Im not proficient in english, sorry.

Me, 42 (M) - distracted, suspicious, anxious, but with a good sense of humor. She, 42 - distracted, adventurous, and immature (a personality trait that seems to me responsible for what I'll describe next).

We've known each other since we were 15 at school. There was always a spark, but we only started dating in our late 20s.

A smooth relationship, without many ups and downs.

We started living together around 27 and became parents at 30.

We've always supported each other, personally and professionally. Everything seemed perfect, or close to it.

Let's fast forward to the beginning of this year. In a casual conversation, feelings were brought up. I asked if she loved me, and she admitted she was confused. I froze and asked why. Then she admitted that lately she hasn't been able to classify her feelings for me, her heart being torn between me and someone else. As I delved deeper into the matter, I realized I had feelings for a former coworker. She said she hadn't seen him in years, but she ran into him at a supermarket, greeted him, and became confused. Days passed, and I kept thinking about it. I was hurt. I brought this up with a mutual friend who was familiar with this story and confided in me that my wife had told him all the details. During her meeting with him at the supermarket, she invited him for coffee and explained her feelings. He praised her courage but had the maturity to tell her that what she was doing wasn't right, and that he didn't feel the same way about her. She tried contacting him through various social media platforms and was blocked.

I began to act defensively and became more controlling. Not wanting to jeopardize my wife's friendship with our mutual friend, I tried to obtain details another way. It was at that moment, because I ended up seeing her again in the GPT chat in a conversation involving the name of the guy in question. Here I confess that I made the first of two mistakes in this process.

I knew her login details, so I accessed her ChatGPT. Everything our friend had told me was described in the chat. I also saw that she used tarot to see if she would ever have a chance at a relationship. In the chat, she even describes the results she got from the aforementioned consultation. Here I question where her self-esteem and maturity lie.

I could then talk to her, clearly acknowledging the mistake I had made. I explained the matter, and I was quite dissatisfied that I hadn't shared all the details.

I told her I felt emotionally betrayed and deeply disappointed. She apologized with great difficulty, adding that she never imagined this whole situation would have this impact on me. She also stated that for her, this wasn't a betrayal. I explained that betrayal doesn't always involve physical contact. She understood and apologized again.

This resulted in a commitment between us. We would begin therapy to help her let go of this unrequited love. She accepted the challenge. She changed her email password (understandable).

The time that followed seemed like a period of rebuilding, with her attending appointments and us living a normal life as a couple.

On my side, as seems normal to me, there was always distrust. I confess that I became more controlling. Sometimes I offered to drive her to work (on my days off), I started calling her more frequently throughout the day, and often, when she was on her phone near me, I felt the need to look at the screen. One of those times, I see the boy's name again in a screenshot of a gpt chat she was saving in a chat with herself. This is where I make my second mistake. I access her phone and confirm that she was indeed safeguarding the information. I couldn't see if she was still feeding the story since the day she promised me she wouldn't do it again. She saw me fiddling with her phone and was obviously uncomfortable. She felt her privacy was being threatened and changed her phone's access code. We both expressed our displeasure, me because I saw she was still thinking about the topic, and she because she felt her privacy was being threatened.

Since then, although we maintained our couple routines, we both agreed that we would try to see what happened.

In the last two months, I noticed we were drifting apart, with less affection and intimacy. Kisses, hugs, hand-holding, etc., began to dwindle. I confess that here I may be feeling more needy and asking for more affection than I'd received throughout the relationship.

I brought up the topic at the beginning of the month, expressing my displeasure, and she confessed that she no longer harbors feelings for me. I asked if the situation was reversible, even if couples therapy were necessary, and she indicated that she doesn't see any turning back.

We then decided to move forward with the divorce.

Since then, I've been experiencing what's known as ""emotional grief,"" which has gone through several phases.

Sadness, difficulty accepting, and not being able to imagine living without her.

She, on the other hand, having already been emotionally detached from the relationship, appears to be calm. She may be in a more advanced stage of this grief.

We are currently living in the same house and want, above all, to maintain a good friendship so that our son feels this separation as little as possible. We want to maintain contact within the appropriate boundaries, discussing only common issues related to our son. She's already found a place, and perhaps because of her immaturity, she's asking me if I want to go see it. It seems to me that she has no idea of ​​the suffering and consequences this whole ordeal has caused.

Perhaps to protect myself emotionally, I'm starting to accept that this decision might be the best for us, as we're separating at a time when we can communicate without friction, and this will be ideal for us to continue doing what's best for our son and myself.

As much as it hurts, I admit that I wouldn't trust her 100% again, that I would continue in a relationship where she would be constantly anxious and controlling, and that this would erode what's left of our relationship, our friendship.

It's very difficult for me, but it will certainly be better this way. For me, for my son, for her.

1ofaksa,https://v.redd.it/h3xgb7hds4xf1,I WORK IN A HAUNTED PLACE,"Hi, I’m Pachu, from Santa Fe, Argentina, and I’ve been working as a concierge in a haunted place for 3 years.
The place in question is a members-only social club that’s over 140 years old. It’s where members gather to play card games like poker or chinchón, play 5-pin billiards, drink coffee, have meals, and socialize.

Most of the members are elderly people, and there have been at least three documented deaths in the building (from “natural causes”). On top of that, many of the regulars struggle with cigarette addiction, gambling problems, or just carry very negative energy.

A lot of strange things happen here, and the overall atmosphere feels extremely heavy. It’s a very large building that takes up an entire city block. It has a restaurant, a card room, an upstairs floor where people play poker, a long dark hallway that leads to the bathrooms and the billiard room, and a basement that hasn’t been opened in over 30 years.
The “paranormal” activity happens throughout the entire club, but it’s especially strong in certain areas like the hallway, the upstairs floor, and the billiard room.
Here are some of the things that have happened to me or happen regularly:

The most common thing is hearing whistles coming from all directions—usually a short whistle, like the kind someone makes to get your attention. The weird thing is, it always happens when I’m alone or just with my father cleaning the place. Sometimes it’s faint, other times it’s so loud it echoes all around you. On a few occasions, I’ve even heard someone whistling a tune down the hallway while I was completely alone.

Another common thing is hearing strange knocks, seeing moving shadows, and even finding that electrical appliances unplug themselves. When no one’s around, you can hear the sound of someone playing billiards, lights turn on by themselves, and the billiard room door moves on its own. I should mention that there are no windows in that room or in the hallway—it’s completely closed off from outside light or wind.

TERRIFYING THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME PERSONALLY:

One of the strangest things I’ve ever seen—witnessed by my father—was when a chair slid backward by at least a full meter. This happened in the morning while we were cleaning, and there was nobody else there.

Another time, I went upstairs to use the bathroom (it’s next to the stairs). While I was doing my business, I started hearing heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. They reached about halfway up… and then started going back down.

Something terrifying happened to my mother one night when she was completely alone downstairs (everyone else was upstairs). She suddenly heard a loud whistle right behind her, and when she turned around, she heard someone laughing mockingly.

Another incident happened to my brother. One night around 3 a.m., he went with a friend to put their motorcycles away in the courtyard. As soon as they entered, they heard loud banging sounds coming from inside the club. They unlocked the door and went in to check if maybe a thief had broken in—but as soon as they stepped inside, the banging moved to the front of the club. When they ran over to check, there was absolutely no one there, so they bolted out in fear.

Something that happened with a member as a witness: while we were both talking in the bathroom, a faucet in front of us suddenly turned on at full blast, even though no one was near it.

And this one happened to my father around 4 a.m. one night, when he was alone and about to close up the place. Suddenly, he started hearing repeated loud bangs coming from the secretary’s office. He thought maybe a window had blown open, so he unlocked the door to check—but as soon as he opened it, the noises stopped completely. Everything inside looked perfectly normal, but there was something very strange: the room was freezing cold, so cold that his breath was visible in the air. My father began to pray, and after a few moments, the atmosphere calmed down again.

These are just a few of the many strange things that have happened to me.
I’d really like to know—do you think these are evil spirits, prankish entities, or just energy manifestations?

Sometimes there’s also a strong rotten smell that appears in certain areas and then disappears on its own.
And about 90% of all the activity happens when the place is empty, when it’s just me, my father, my mother, or my brother.

About the videos I’m attaching:

First video: it shows the billiard room door opening by itself.
Second video: it captures a strange sound coming from the billiard room. That day, there was a power outage, and for some reason I decided to record even though there was no light. The weirdest part is that I didn’t hear that sound at all while filming (because if I had, I would’ve definitely run away). It was only the camera that picked it up. It honestly sounds like the kind of eerie noise you’d hear in a horror movie—and every time I play it back, I’m just as shocked as you probably will be.

**\[Nero 02:  New Recruits (P2)\]**

[William](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/vkVIORVVgw) waited patiently for the class to simmer down because right now they were rattling and prattling off at the mouth like the lid to a stainless steel pot on a piping hot stove. A thing as simple and fickle as getting code names had gotten them to stop sulking over their terrible introductions in part 1. William made sure to look over at you just to make sure you were still aboard the Angel Hunters flagship after that shipwreck of an introductory into the supposed wicked world of “Dark Fiction” that the author swears is not quite like any other subgenre and so he just has to call it this. Phew. Okay. You’re still onboard and not overboard somewhere, drowning in an attempt to get the hell away from this ghostship. Great! William thought before starting:

“Lenda. Your code name is Wraith. Nano. Yours is… Nano. And Nero. Yours is ‘the Beast.’ Use your code names any time we are in the field. Hmm. I suppose I should pick one for myself. I’ve never used one considering my stories a bit grittier. Meh. I suppose you could all continue to call me Sensei. Great. Hope everyone likes their name. If not too bad.”

[Nero](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/a7TDu9N3So) rooted and hooted like an unstoppable maniac Animaniac on the loose. Suddenly he paused mid fist pump and hopped from off the top of the desk he had somehow managed to balance himself atop with such great skill. Huh? He didn’t actually know the meaning of his code name ‘the Beast’ he had just spent all this time rooting for like a bloke. I mean there was the guy from Marvel, “Beast,” but that wouldn’t have made any sense because that guy was super smart, and he was... Wait! Was he about to call himself not smart?! Which would imply he was er... never mind.

[Lenda](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/o11K26jhzY) basked in his befuddlement. It was a rare occurrence of quietness from someone usually so skilled at being a nuisance. Feeling sorry for him, she whispered playfully into his ear that she would do him a solid by googling away his vexation. Her fingers went to work. She giggled wildly when his eyes nearly popped out of his head in shock when he saw the search results. It was fitting for a jerk like him she thought. *But* her code name, oh my God! Totally to die for! Seriously she fell head over heels for it as soon as it rolled off the tip of Sensei’s tongue. Think about it. Put her two professions together and it was epic word salad: *“Shinobi Wraith.”*

[Nano](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/gVagctM4c8) watched all of this unfold with a bitter indifference only something or someone who was possessed by the spirit of AI could muster. His blue irises flashed with numbers as he connected to the Core Matrix in a pointless attempt to understand human behavior. If he was going to “destroy you and all of humanity” like he had promised, he would have to understand why you and all of humanity acted the way you did. The realization was bitter and filled with irony as rich as a box of chocolates he couldn’t help but share as he looked over at you with another one of those lovely death stares, he also loved to share, but *not* like a box of chocolates!       

“Settle down class. I have another announcement to make. Now. Before we continue to our field training, I should introduce the person in charge of all major operations. She’s a woman who needs no introduction. The AI Matrix she constructed from the ground up is crucial in maintaining our underground facilities. It also plays a critical role in advancing our ultimate doomsday project. Please applaud the prestigious [Doctor Susan Jane.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/ro92AdVO2s)

William’s longwinded announcement was a bit confusing. It became something of a controversy when he opened the door, and a young girl entered the classroom. She walked over and greeted you rather professionally for a teen. Her smile matched the deepness of her woodland green eyes that burned with curiosity like a forest fire. A know-how like a robin or hoodlum wading through Sherwood Forest. She was a pleasant girl who was hard to forget. Another thing that was hard to forget was how her lab coat barely fit. Her arms had been chewed up by the rolled up, crumpled up sleeves. The bottom of her coat seemed bottomless as it dangled dangerously close to becoming a broken magic carpet. Surely William would explain away the whole thing as some kind of practical joke. Ah. Or maybe the esteemed doctor had been hit with a shrink ray?

William took a step back and gestured with his hand that the floor was hers. Seeing this she gave you one more studious look, William a studious head nod, and then stood studiously before the class. A moment or two was spent flipping and studying the pages secured to her super important clipboard before she cleared her throat and spoke:

“Um. Greetings class. I will be your squad’s coordinating officer. There is a lot to be done, and I’d like to get to work right away. I reviewed all three of your profiles extensively. Each one of you were selected for a reason. So please. Try to take your training seriously. My evil plan depends on the three of you being competent enough to destroy the world. Sounds cliché, doesn’t it? I suppose all supervillains have that one bit in common no matter how ‘realistic’ or ambitious the narrative. But in all seriousness. We are totally going to bring it all crashing down! Starting with America. It’s *so* close to collapsing! All it needs is a teeny-tiny—”

“Is this some kind of joke?” Nero rudely interrupted.

“Why? Was my speech a little too cheeky? Tch. I kind of thought that would be the case. People have been predicting the fall of America for years now. I feared my speech would come off like *the Boy Who Cried Wolf,* or in my case ‘the girl,’” she smiled.

“No. That’s not it.”

“Then what is it?”

“You’re a kid.”

“I’m like five years younger than you.”

“Bah! I’m not taking orders from a kid.”

“Hey, Nero,” Nano said in a flat tone.

“Huh? What do you want AI boy?”

 “If I were you, I would watch how I spoke to her. Don’t let her size fool you. She can turn your life into a living nightmare.”

“Hah! I eat living nightmares for breakfast,” he said with smoldering intensity.

Lenda rolled her eyes and said, “Gah. Do you ever stop?”

“No. I don’t. I escaped from Hell and have been running ever since! I don’t remember my escape, but I was told I did by the angels who found me. That had to be the lowest point in my life. But that’s not the point! The point is... uh. What was the point? Oh yeah. That’s right—what can ‘Doctor Pint-sized’ do to me if Lucy couldn’t stop me from escaping Hell?! That’s right! The angels couldn’t stop me from ditching the Holy Order either! The forces of dark—""

“I’ll tell you what I can do,” Susan smoldered even harder. Her face burning red with anger as she stared him down with a murderous glint in her eye like someone who had carved into a pumpkin with a meat cleaver. “You better take your training serious! The fate of the Illuminati depends on it! If you fail—any of you for that matter—fail to become proper Angel Hunters—you’ll scorn the day you were born. First, I’ll wait for you to sleep, or in your case, Nano, I’ll power you down. I’ll wait too. Heh. I’ll wait until you’re nice and fat with forgetfulness before I have my friend Sarahiel kidnap you and bring you to my lair deep down in the bowels of Bunker 17. Then I’ll trap your body inside the same bio-caskets we use to keep legates alive. But instead of letting you drift away into peaceful cryostasis, I’ll hijack your brain and upload your mind into my virtual reality matrix. Hah! That’s right! My master simulation is nothing like the cheap stuff we allow on the civilian market. What I’ve created feels just like the real thing thanks to my AI Matrix. Not only that, but I can program it to overload your synaptic connections so that you feel pain and fear tenfold natural human biology. Then I’ll override my AI Matrix and make sure you relive your worst freaking nightmare again and again—in slow time for a trillion artificial life cycles!”

Nero fell out of his chair in shock. Lenda covered her eyes and peaked over at her as if she were already trapped inside the living nightmare. Nano smirked for the first time probably ever when he processed their reactions. Then with the same devious smirk hanging from his face, he said, “I won’t let you down, mother. I won’t allow these two knuckleheads to do so either. We will destroy the world even if I have to drag them along kicking and screaming.”

“Good,” the curious doctor said as she happened upon an idea. She placed her pen to her lips and then smirked as she thought about it. “Nano. I think I’m going to make you squad leader.”

Nero jumped to his feet and cried out in protest, “Now hold on a second there! Why does he get to be the leader?! And why did he call you mother?!”

“Because I created him. Duh,” she replied.

“So many questions,” Lenda muttered.

“Now is not the time,” the doc said before turning to you and adding, “I’m sure all of this talk-talk-talk is starting to bore-bore-bore the Neutral Observer because I hate it.” Then she glanced at her clipboard before jotting something down. “Hmm. Are you guys ready for your first mission or what?”

“Yes!” Nero roared. “Let’s take down a guardian angel—no, a cohort of paladins! I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life,” he paused for a moment and glared at Nano, growling, “You better stay out of my way. I’m the chosen one not you. If you get in my way, I’ll show you with my fists why I’m the Beast when I knock a few circuits loose on your motherboard!”

“You’re not as strong as you think,” he replied.

“I’m stronger than you,” Nero fired back.

“No, you’re not,” Nano said.

“There’s only one way to find out.”

“Meh. You’re not worth the effort.”

“Chicken.”

“Rooster.”

*“Whaaa!”* Nero exclaimed as he dashed in front of Nano’s desk at blistering speed. The velocity at which he traveled caused Nano’s long dark ponytail to rustle like a tree branch caught in a violent windstorm. Even the front legs to his desk rattled and rocked. Nero sneered and waved around his fist. His power was undeniable. Almost as undeniable as his tantrums. “You don’t know how bad you just messed up computer boy. Nobody calls me a rooster. *Grr!”*

“I’m shaking in my computer case.”

“Oh yeah?! Meet me outside in the courtyard!”

“Nero, sit down!” the kid doctor shouted.

“He started it first, Wicked Stepmother!”

“Wait. What did you call me?”

“Wicked Stepmother Susan.”

“This is hopeless,” she pouted.

“The name suits you,” William told her.

She couldn’t believe her ears. Not only that but she refused to even acknowledge the smug look on his face. Ever since she had been cloned, her temper had become something of an inside joke. She knew the nick was going to stick. It was only a matter of time before her colleagues down in Bunker 17 found out about it. Her cheeks reddened at the thought and at wanting nothing more than to blow up into a million pieces. “Fine. I suppose I could use a code name too. Even though it’s not really a code name. Thank you, Nero, for your unintentional assistance.”

“Hah! No problem,” he replied.

“Don’t let it happen again!” she erupted.  

“Okay, jeez,” he said before creeping back down in his desk and mumbling, “Wow. Wicked Stepmother really means business. I better be careful.”

Lenda giggled and said, “You don’t have a careful bone in your body.”

“I do have a careful bone!” he retorted.

“It’s not in your skull,” she laughed.

“Stupid ninja girl,” Nero groused like an angry goose.

She stuck her tongue out at him, “Corky rooster.”

Nero threw his hand up in dramatic fashion. It was clear he was trying to get Wicked Stepmother Susan’s attention. She did her best to ignore him, but it was too much. She just couldn’t stand his shenanigans any longer and relented, “What is it now, Nero?”

“Lenda keeps teasing me.”

“Lenda, stop teasing Nero.”

“I will if he stops gaslighting me.”

“Nero, stop gaslighting Lenda.”

The two glared at each other before folding their arms and stewing like a pot of gumbo. The job was going to be tougher than she initially thought, Wicked Stepmother thought to herself with a hint of sadness. She gazed at you, right when doubt was deepest. Her expression said everything and nothing. You could feel her pain, but not really because the whole thing was still kind of new and confusing. Being so blatantly thrown into the line of *fire* like this. I mean. Surely this must seem ridiculous to a mature, knowledgeable, and cultured person such as yourself. It better be because that’s what Wicked Stepmother believed, and Wicked Stepmother was *never* wrong! *Ever!* She could see the smirk on your face. *Err!* Maybe just maybe you were another Nero? This was only the second part to what was going to be a very long series. And your profile was redacted by Ark Haven himself, making you truly a mystery and curiosity as hard to crack as a macadamia.

Yep. She had spiraled but *you* were someone worth spiraling on and on about like a good song. A song that sticks like candy to your teeth. She hoped you were fun to be around like a party with good music. It would be really cool because the two of you could grab ice coffees at Starbucks one day and just talk. Um. Yeah. 13-year-olds drank coffee! Meh. Maybe you were one of those boring adults who objected to drinking coffee because you found everything ‘objectionable’ like Sensei William Chosen. Hmm. Well in that case, she could pick your brain about the Shadow Network, over smoothies, just in case she needed to, um, assassinate one of her rivals.

She just knew that you were special and promised herself that she’d find a way to upload your mind into her AI Matrix. Stealing your brain would be totally worth it! The dopamine rush alone was worth the price of admission. Just image examining and then mapping *your* mind as a unique personality inside of her ultimate simulation. It was an idea that filled her with guilty joy! Almost as much guilty joy as eating an Almond Joy! Oh, or that one time when adult Wicked Stepmother and her DPI colleagues almost reactivated the stolen angelic gateway way back in the day. It was an impossible nut to crack, kind of like you, but getting that clunky artifact going would’ve really kicked their plans for the apocalypse into hyperdrive. Oh well. There’s always tomorrow.

1ofaie2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ofaie2/title_am_i_rushing_things_or_is_he_just_not_that/,Title: Am I rushing things or is he just not that into me? Need some perspective,"Hi everyone! I’d love some outside opinions because I’m going in circles in my own head.

I’m 29F and I’ve been dating this guy (34M) from work — we first clicked at the gym and started hanging out. It’s been a little over a month now, though part of that time he was away traveling. Most of our “dates” have been spontaneous post-gym drinks that lead back to my place.

The only intentionally planned hangout was recently when **I** made dinner for him at my place. I put real effort into it — even had breakfast plans for the next morning — but he still rushed out first thing without staying for coffee. He always leaves early like that, even when we’ve spent the night together.

What throws me off is that he does say he likes me, he treats me when we go out, and I can see him opening up little by little… but then there’s zero initiative or planning from his side. A week has passed since that dinner and he hasn’t made any effort to plan something thoughtful in return. We’ve messaged, but nothing more. I half-expect a last-minute “want to hang out tonight?” text — if anything at all.

So I’m stuck wondering:

• Would a guy who’s genuinely interested act like this?  
• Is he just slow to open up and show effort?  
• Am I being impatient?  
• Or am I wasting my time on someone who doesn’t actually want something real?

I’d love some honest perspectives. It’s hard to know if I should give this more time or stop giving so much energy to someone who isn’t fully showing up.

**TL;DR:** I’m 29F dating a 34M coworker for a little over a month. He says he likes me and is slowly opening up, but never plans dates or shows real effort — even rushed out after I made him dinner. Trying to figure out if he’s genuinely interested or if I’m wasting my time.",1,1761342650.0,relationships,7,1.0,False

**\[Nero 02:  New Recruits (P2)\]**

[William](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/vkVIORVVgw) waited patiently for the class to simmer down because right now they were rattling and prattling off at the mouth like the lid to a stainless steel pot on a piping hot stove. A thing as simple and fickle as getting code names had gotten them to stop sulking over their terrible introductions in part 1. William made sure to look over at you just to make sure you were still aboard the Angel Hunters flagship after that shipwreck of an introductory into the supposed wicked world of “Dark Fiction” that the author swears is not quite like any other subgenre and so he just has to call it this. Phew. Okay. You’re still onboard and not overboard somewhere, drowning in an attempt to get the hell away from this ghostship. Great! William thought before starting:

“Lenda. Your code name is Wraith. Nano. Yours is… Nano. And Nero. Yours is ‘the Beast.’ Use your code names any time we are in the field. Hmm. I suppose I should pick one for myself. I’ve never used one considering my stories a bit grittier. Meh. I suppose you could all continue to call me Sensei. Great. Hope everyone likes their name. If not too bad.”

[Nero](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/a7TDu9N3So) rooted and hooted like an unstoppable maniac Animaniac on the loose. Suddenly he paused mid fist pump and hopped from off the top of the desk he had somehow managed to balance himself atop with such great skill. Huh? He didn’t actually know the meaning of his code name ‘the Beast’ he had just spent all this time rooting for like a bloke. I mean there was the guy from Marvel, “Beast,” but that wouldn’t have made any sense because that guy was super smart, and he was... Wait! Was he about to call himself not smart?! Which would imply he was er... never mind.

[Lenda](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/o11K26jhzY) basked in his befuddlement. It was a rare occurrence of quietness from someone usually so skilled at being a nuisance. Feeling sorry for him, she whispered playfully into his ear that she would do him a solid by googling away his vexation. Her fingers went to work. She giggled wildly when his eyes nearly popped out of his head in shock when he saw the search results. It was fitting for a jerk like him she thought. *But* her code name, oh my God! Totally to die for! Seriously she fell head over heels for it as soon as it rolled off the tip of Sensei’s tongue. Think about it. Put her two professions together and it was epic word salad: *“Shinobi Wraith.”*

[Nano](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/gVagctM4c8) watched all of this unfold with a bitter indifference only something or someone who was possessed by the spirit of AI could muster. His blue irises flashed with numbers as he connected to the Core Matrix in a pointless attempt to understand human behavior. If he was going to “destroy you and all of humanity” like he had promised, he would have to understand why you and all of humanity acted the way you did. The realization was bitter and filled with irony as rich as a box of chocolates he couldn’t help but share as he looked over at you with another one of those lovely death stares, he also loved to share, but *not* like a box of chocolates!       

“Settle down class. I have another announcement to make. Now. Before we continue to our field training, I should introduce the person in charge of all major operations. She’s a woman who needs no introduction. The AI Matrix she constructed from the ground up is crucial in maintaining our underground facilities. It also plays a critical role in advancing our ultimate doomsday project. Please applaud the prestigious [Doctor Susan Jane.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/ro92AdVO2s)

William’s longwinded announcement was a bit confusing. It became something of a controversy when he opened the door, and a young girl entered the classroom. She walked over and greeted you rather professionally for a teen. Her smile matched the deepness of her woodland green eyes that burned with curiosity like a forest fire. A know-how like a robin or hoodlum wading through Sherwood Forest. She was a pleasant girl who was hard to forget. Another thing that was hard to forget was how her lab coat barely fit. Her arms had been chewed up by the rolled up, crumpled up sleeves. The bottom of her coat seemed bottomless as it dangled dangerously close to becoming a broken magic carpet. Surely William would explain away the whole thing as some kind of practical joke. Ah. Or maybe the esteemed doctor had been hit with a shrink ray?

William took a step back and gestured with his hand that the floor was hers. Seeing this she gave you one more studious look, William a studious head nod, and then stood studiously before the class. A moment or two was spent flipping and studying the pages secured to her super important clipboard before she cleared her throat and spoke:

“Um. Greetings class. I will be your squad’s coordinating officer. There is a lot to be done, and I’d like to get to work right away. I reviewed all three of your profiles extensively. Each one of you were selected for a reason. So please. Try to take your training seriously. My evil plan depends on the three of you being competent enough to destroy the world. Sounds cliché, doesn’t it? I suppose all supervillains have that one bit in common no matter how ‘realistic’ or ambitious the narrative. But in all seriousness. We are totally going to bring it all crashing down! Starting with America. It’s *so* close to collapsing! All it needs is a teeny-tiny—”

“Is this some kind of joke?” Nero rudely interrupted.

“Why? Was my speech a little too cheeky? Tch. I kind of thought that would be the case. People have been predicting the fall of America for years now. I feared my speech would come off like *the Boy Who Cried Wolf,* or in my case ‘the girl,’” she smiled.

“No. That’s not it.”

“Then what is it?”

“You’re a kid.”

“I’m like five years younger than you.”

“Bah! I’m not taking orders from a kid.”

“Hey, Nero,” Nano said in a flat tone.

“Huh? What do you want AI boy?”

 “If I were you, I would watch how I spoke to her. Don’t let her size fool you. She can turn your life into a living nightmare.”

“Hah! I eat living nightmares for breakfast,” he said with smoldering intensity.

Lenda rolled her eyes and said, “Gah. Do you ever stop?”

“No. I don’t. I escaped from Hell and have been running ever since! I don’t remember my escape, but I was told I did by the angels who found me. That had to be the lowest point in my life. But that’s not the point! The point is... uh. What was the point? Oh yeah. That’s right—what can ‘Doctor Pint-sized’ do to me if Lucy couldn’t stop me from escaping Hell?! That’s right! The angels couldn’t stop me from ditching the Holy Order either! The forces of dark—""

“I’ll tell you what I can do,” Susan smoldered even harder. Her face burning red with anger as she stared him down with a murderous glint in her eye like someone who had carved into a pumpkin with a meat cleaver. “You better take your training serious! The fate of the Illuminati depends on it! If you fail—any of you for that matter—fail to become proper Angel Hunters—you’ll scorn the day you were born. First, I’ll wait for you to sleep, or in your case, Nano, I’ll power you down. I’ll wait too. Heh. I’ll wait until you’re nice and fat with forgetfulness before I have my friend Sarahiel kidnap you and bring you to my lair deep down in the bowels of Bunker 17. Then I’ll trap your body inside the same bio-caskets we use to keep legates alive. But instead of letting you drift away into peaceful cryostasis, I’ll hijack your brain and upload your mind into my virtual reality matrix. Hah! That’s right! My master simulation is nothing like the cheap stuff we allow on the civilian market. What I’ve created feels just like the real thing thanks to my AI Matrix. Not only that, but I can program it to overload your synaptic connections so that you feel pain and fear tenfold natural human biology. Then I’ll override my AI Matrix and make sure you relive your worst freaking nightmare again and again—in slow time for a trillion artificial life cycles!”

Nero fell out of his chair in shock. Lenda covered her eyes and peaked over at her as if she were already trapped inside the living nightmare. Nano smirked for the first time probably ever when he processed their reactions. Then with the same devious smirk hanging from his face, he said, “I won’t let you down, mother. I won’t allow these two knuckleheads to do so either. We will destroy the world even if I have to drag them along kicking and screaming.”

“Good,” the curious doctor said as she happened upon an idea. She placed her pen to her lips and then smirked as she thought about it. “Nano. I think I’m going to make you squad leader.”

Nero jumped to his feet and cried out in protest, “Now hold on a second there! Why does he get to be the leader?! And why did he call you mother?!”

“Because I created him. Duh,” she replied.

“So many questions,” Lenda muttered.

“Now is not the time,” the doc said before turning to you and adding, “I’m sure all of this talk-talk-talk is starting to bore-bore-bore the Neutral Observer because I hate it.” Then she glanced at her clipboard before jotting something down. “Hmm. Are you guys ready for your first mission or what?”

“Yes!” Nero roared. “Let’s take down a guardian angel—no, a cohort of paladins! I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life,” he paused for a moment and glared at Nano, growling, “You better stay out of my way. I’m the chosen one not you. If you get in my way, I’ll show you with my fists why I’m the Beast when I knock a few circuits loose on your motherboard!”

“You’re not as strong as you think,” he replied.

“I’m stronger than you,” Nero fired back.

“No, you’re not,” Nano said.

“There’s only one way to find out.”

“Meh. You’re not worth the effort.”

“Chicken.”

“Rooster.”

*“Whaaa!”* Nero exclaimed as he dashed in front of Nano’s desk at blistering speed. The velocity at which he traveled caused Nano’s long dark ponytail to rustle like a tree branch caught in a violent windstorm. Even the front legs to his desk rattled and rocked. Nero sneered and waved around his fist. His power was undeniable. Almost as undeniable as his tantrums. “You don’t know how bad you just messed up computer boy. Nobody calls me a rooster. *Grr!”*

“I’m shaking in my computer case.”

“Oh yeah?! Meet me outside in the courtyard!”

“Nero, sit down!” the kid doctor shouted.

“He started it first, Wicked Stepmother!”

“Wait. What did you call me?”

“Wicked Stepmother Susan.”

“This is hopeless,” she pouted.

“The name suits you,” William told her.

She couldn’t believe her ears. Not only that but she refused to even acknowledge the smug look on his face. Ever since she had been cloned, her temper had become something of an inside joke. She knew the nick was going to stick. It was only a matter of time before her colleagues down in Bunker 17 found out about it. Her cheeks reddened at the thought and at wanting nothing more than to blow up into a million pieces. “Fine. I suppose I could use a code name too. Even though it’s not really a code name. Thank you, Nero, for your unintentional assistance.”

“Hah! No problem,” he replied.

“Don’t let it happen again!” she erupted.  

“Okay, jeez,” he said before creeping back down in his desk and mumbling, “Wow. Wicked Stepmother really means business. I better be careful.”

Lenda giggled and said, “You don’t have a careful bone in your body.”

“I do have a careful bone!” he retorted.

“It’s not in your skull,” she laughed.

“Stupid ninja girl,” Nero groused like an angry goose.

She stuck her tongue out at him, “Corky rooster.”

Nero threw his hand up in dramatic fashion. It was clear he was trying to get Wicked Stepmother Susan’s attention. She did her best to ignore him, but it was too much. She just couldn’t stand his shenanigans any longer and relented, “What is it now, Nero?”

“Lenda keeps teasing me.”

“Lenda, stop teasing Nero.”

“I will if he stops gaslighting me.”

“Nero, stop gaslighting Lenda.”

The two glared at each other before folding their arms and stewing like a pot of gumbo. The job was going to be tougher than she initially thought, Wicked Stepmother thought to herself with a hint of sadness. She gazed at you, right when doubt was deepest. Her expression said everything and nothing. You could feel her pain, but not really because the whole thing was still kind of new and confusing.

**2025 ARCANUM EXPERIMENT #15 AKA BAD DECISIONS MAKE GOOD STORIES (The scent of bad decisions and regrettable choices - skanky dive bars, illicit trysts in afterhours alleyways, and indolic floral perfume mixed with sweat.)** In the vial: I uh… don’t know how to describe it, but that’s interesting, I’ve never had an Alkemia smell like that. It oddly smells “clean” in a very specific, baby wipes powdery way which has to be the white florals, but it’s mixed with something the lightest bit boozy and something almost… cough syrup? Chalky in that medicinal sort of way. Sweat, sure, I see that, but a very sweet take on it, like the sweat of someone who eats too much sugar. On the skin: a definite floral element, like… lilies, or something almost bubblegummy, tuberose? It has a clear anise in there, perhaps they were going for that sort of liquor, but it contributes to this licorice feel that makes this a bit medicinal. There is nothing here I identify as animalic, but the sweat aspect is really fascinating - obviously they didn’t go for a funky, actually BO smell, but what they do have here mixed with the boozy notes really takes me to dancing at the club - that “sugary booze spilled on the floor” sort of smell, and I think the heavy florals conjuring up the idea of sweat mixed with perfumes. It’s interesting! I would’ve never thought of mixing these notes together but I’m into it, but yeah, it could lean a bit medicinal. **9/10**

**NIGHT SKY GATHERING POEMS (REVISITED) (hot melted candle wax, ripening groves of lemon trees, wet cobblestones, blooming cyclamen, gnarled olive wood, crumbling limestone cement, rusty wrought iron, dried tree moss, fallen neroli flowers, creeping river mist, and night musk.)** Doesn't fit the theme much, but I [recently reviewed the Autumn set](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1nmunkh/first_impressions_of_alkemias_autumnal_charms_and/) and wanted to re-review two of them after a rest. This opens with a very sharp, aldehydic citrus. Not fizzy, just bordering on cleaning product. I unfortunately don’t get that much beeswax (Pineward’s Chandlery is still my white whale in this aspect), but I think there is a bit tempering the metal. It’s less ozonic, orris and powdery than Mist of Rain or Lilacs Along the Winding Drive, rather it keeps the metallic edge of the rusty iron, which right at the opening mixes with the citrus in a weird way and makes this smell, again, like a cleaning product. Luckily this settles down quickly, and I think it's much more successful at making you smell like you came from a night walk than Mist of Rain is, with a metallic base rather than gentle woods. It combined with the spicy-green notes gives this a bit of a... trees-planted-on-the-sidewalk smell? Like, going on a walk in my town and it rained 3 hours ago, rather than ""it just finished raining"". Alkemia's rain note is a bit musty and it's much less present here than in Mist of Rain. I tend to think of Alkemia’s atmospherics as not very successful (except for The First Dandelion, Gaea and Vert Sur Le Vert, woo wee those are GREEN and/or EARTHY) but I think this one does a good job of being evocative of a walk. I think I’ll raise its grade from 6/10 to **7/10** but I have a perfume that fills a pretty similar niche (Tulips & Chimneys).

**BREATH AND SHADOW (twilit chyprean musks and subtle exhalations of woodsmoke.**) In the vial: definitely very smoky, but it’s not pure bbq, there is a resinous base to this, a bit earthy and musky. On the skin: that’s a lot less smoke and a lot more oakmoss, bitter and earthy. There is no leather here but something about it is almost leather-like, salty. The smoke here is quite interesting, rather close to wood that is actively burning instead of embers, but again without going as smoky as say Ydalir. Almost savory, the smoke has a lot of character - it’s like Alkemia’s take on a more classic men’s oakmoss cologne. It feels very… outdoorsy? Something about it goes the slightest bit soapy, in the way smoky incense-leaning perfumes sometimes do, but it’s not too bad. While I enjoy the opening (though it’s not what I’d usually wear), it becomes less of a nice realistic woodsmoke and the soapy… oakmoss? Starts to take over. Initial 7/10, downgraded to a **5/10**

**INCENSE OF A NEW CHURCH (incense of agarwood, costus, mentholated tobacco, steam-heated radiators, and old machinery)** In the vial: COSTUS! Wet fur, and a pang of hot metal in the way of rubbery ambergris. On the skin: the animalic aspect calms down a bit, but it still has a bit of that oily, unwashed feel to it. My skin tends to amp Alkemia’s incense but this one is ok, though strong, it mashes well with the mentholated tobacco - which is more cigarettes than rolling tobacco, borderline ashy. It’s not a menthol bomb, just a touch. The metal is also loud and clear, in line with Alkemia’s other metals. Mostly this is an incense oud with animalic elements. Hmm. I’ve tended not to enjoy Alkemia’s industrial scents because they tend to be heavy on a rubbery ambergris which is not as present here. I think this is their best executed one by far, the animalic edge from the costus and the smoky oud and the faint touch of menthol really work for it. It keeps a bit of the powdery aspects of their other industrial ones without going full ambergris. This does not particularly smell like a church to me, more like a boiler room… but the incense is curious and evocative. I don’t think I would reach for it because sadly it’s too incense-heavy for me, but I repeat I think it’s their best industrial smell and it’s quite well executed, **8/10.**

**LE CHAT NOIR (REVISITED) (feral fur-musk and warmly beckoning ember-spices.)** I had a pretty negative initial impression of this, so let’s see after resting for a month or so. In the vial I find it less repulsively “wet cat” than I used to, definitely the same fur note as Kitten and the Falling Leaves but much more dominant. On the skin: alright, that’s much more balanced than it used to be. I can’t quite identify the spices but it’s not cinnamon, or at least not dominantly so - I’d say this is quite peppery. Beyond that, it’s a much more balanced musk than before, where it was purely animalic. Alkemia has a very specific basic “musk” smell (seen in e.g. Rose Musk) that reads slightly too-clean for me, skin-like but a bit soapy. If you already know you like musk, I think this is now well-balanced with a light fur touch and black pepper. It’s warm and cozy. I’m not the hugest musk person, but this is now something I could see myself not disgusted with wearing, so it goes from a 2/10 to a **6/10**. The non-Christmas spices and musky animalics remind me a lot of one of my favorite Alkemias which I full sized, Persian Tea Room (black tea, sand, spices, musk and leather, so it makes sense), but the leather is precisely one of my favorite elements and balances the musk well, while this one is a more basic musk. However this can be for you if you like the idea of a peppery musk. Also: important to rest Alkemias exhibit A!

**KITTEN AND THE FALLING LEAVES (REVISITED) (musky softness of fur and the wood-dry freshness of autumn leaves)** In the vial: unmistakable Alkemia’s white amber, wonder why they don’t list it. On the skin: immediately hit by said white amber. If you’ve smelled it, you know it. It’s a bit lactonic, a bit ambery, a bit almondy. I can barely get the fur now, the most dominant balancing note under the amber is a dry, cedary wood. I enjoy Alkemia’s white amber so almost all of them start off as a 7/10 but realistically I can’t (and don’t want to) get all of them so I have to focus on the other non-white amber notes: here they’re not very inspiring. Other than the faint clean wood and the slightest hint of fur, I am definitely getting some… menthol, oddly?? I think this is how they are going for the idea of autumn air. The menthol gets stronger as it dries, too. It’s interesting, but doesn’t speak to me much - Fallen Snow Angels does this much more successfully for me, mint on a creamy and patchouli base. The fur, which should be the standout element here, is barely noticeable on my skin/to my nose. Still a pleasant fragrance to wear, **7/10**.

**ELECTRIC FUR (sensual scent of aroused skin and soft musky fur.)** In the vial this smells a bit sweeter and creamier than their usual musk (like Le Chat Noir or Rose Musk), a bit of their white amber - moreso than KatFL. On the skin: again, a bit of their white amber, moreso than any animalic - and something almost rubbery and powdery? Which I typically identify with their ambergris, but not sure here. I think they’re going for the aroused/electric aspect with their metal-adjacent/”grey amber” notes. A bit of an uninspiring skin scent, somewhere between their creamier, vanillic white ambers and their powdery, ambergris-heavy industrial scents, with only the lightest touch of musk and not very animalic at all. It doesn’t speak to me whatsoever but I’m not bothered by it either, **5/10** (then again it takes a lot for a skin scent to impress me, only Aurora springs to mind - if you’re into them, this one might be worth a shot). 

**NATURE OF THE BEAST (Amyris wood, Elemi balsam, and raw dark musk with Haitian vetiver, ambroxan, spiced patchouli, labdanum and botanical pheromones.)** In the vial: yup, ambroxany patchouli. On the skin: an immediate freshness (from the elemi balsam, I suppose, but it is almost minty) comes out. It’s not POTENTLY animalic in a “dirty” way but it is quite musky, not in the cleaner way of the other musks here, a bit darker and more ambery with a lot of wood and a metallic, earthy patchouli. The drydown is not unpleasant, but it does have a sort of off-smelling acrid base (ambroxan and vetiver?) that is not my favorite - but the musk aspect is pleasant. It’s not a particularly dirty animalic but I do love indolic scents so take that with a grain of salt - there is also a strong spicy green component to this, it sort of conjures up the image of animals in a winter forest; a lot of the elements here (spicy green pine, vetiver and ambroxan, patchouli and woods, labdanum base) make this a bit mainstream men’s cologney - but the emphasis on the spicy greens through this VERY light menthol note + the slightly dirtier-than-usual animalics make this a bit more of an atmospheric, evocative take on those men’s colognes (take that from someone who tends to dislike them). For that I would give it a **8/10**, I can see myself reaching for it in winter/autumn when I want to wear a more sexy sort of masc scent.

**VIRIDIS ARCANUM (Turkish galbanum incense resin, Russian leather, and the fresh tips of coniferous Siberian Forest greens)** In the vial: definitely a VERY fresh pine and labdanum, more than leather. On the skin: opens very sharp and green, almost like cut grass, just a lot of galbanum I feel. Wow- did I go immediately nose blind to this or is it that subtle? I feel I can’t get much other than my brain identifying “yep, that’s pine”. It’s not leather-forward at all, but it does provide a grounding, salty base counteracting the fresh greens and galbanum. No “incense” whatsoever in the sense of frankincense or nag champa or smoke, just galbanum, a bit acrid in that green sort of way. This is… fine? If I were a masc cologne wearer, this feels like a safe everyday reach with some personality, a bit more unisex than masc. The pine is there but not pinesol, the galbanum is enjoyable, the leather is barely there but ties the whole thing together. Evokes a cold forest. It’s perfectly fine, would wear it to a nice event where I want to smell elegant and unique but not stifle anyone, **6/10**.

**SUPERNATURAL (Iso-E, ambrox, Tonkin musk (cruelty free), and aroma molecules “Is it smooth, salty skin? Ambergris musk? Creamy blonde woods?”.)** In the vial: there is something almost vanillic and salty about this, definitely the creamy part - some of the aspects they use for their white amber, but not all the way, less sugar sweet. On the skin: yeah, that’s their white amber, but again a less sweet version of it, with a bit of blonde woods - but not too much, it doesn’t read dusty, but there is a gentle powdery woods base.T he ambergris is very light-handed, it doesn’t cross into rubber as it often does for me. It’s oddly almost gourmand, but not in any identifiable way, just vanillic and a bit buttery - not as much as Luminae, from what I remember.  It’s a bit like Magpie’s Rhyme actually, there might be some almond in there but very little. Very similar to Ghost Fire, including it wearing incredibly close to the skin. Just feels like a variation of their standard white amber to me: if you’d like Ghost Fire with just a touch of musk and cashmeran, this would be it. **7/10**   

**ENIGMA (Iso Super E - “subtle musk, dry woods, faint ambergris.”)** In the vial: I guess that’s Iso Super E, but it smells… pickled? On the skin: luckily no pickles, but it also just sort of disappears - which is basically how it’s advertised. I definitely get cedar, it’s that clean dry wood scent. It smells a bit like a room filled with old wooden furniture that is gathering dust, not in a bad way. It’s a bit musky, not in the animalic way, just in the way human skin can be. A bit like a warm hug from someone wearing a sweater. It’s nice! Very simple, veryyyy faint, but honestly as someone who likes the clean cedar smell, I wouldn’t mind a rollerball of this if I know I’m gonna be hanging out with someone who hates perfumes. **8/10**

**PEARLE NOIRE (skin scent  - cream musk, black vanilla, myrrhis odorata, black cardamon, white sandalwood)** In the vial: oh nooo. I’m afraid this one is a victim of Alkemia’s “white musk that smells like baby wipes” curse :( On the skin: yep, that’s it, baby powder. I get the slightest touch of vanilla and a tiiiny bit of cardamom that reminds me of cardamom-flavored sweets, but it’s not enough to offset the white musk. I wish the myrrh were stronger, this would benefit from some balsamic warmth. Disappears into the skin pretty fast and just becomes a clean skin-like musk scent, so in that way it gets a **5/10** vs the stronger clean white musks that I dislike more (eg Ghost of Dear Temptations).

**POUDRE D’ÈPICINE (gender-neutral powder and Japanese musk with a soft enticement of mint creme anglaise)** In the vial: very nice powder, like lightly mint-scented makeup powder. On the skin: oh, interesting. It’s a very very gentle mint, layered on something… that’s not quite vanilla. It’s a bit of white amber, a bit of musk (not white musk like Pearle Noire). It’s a bit dusty in the way Dustsceawung is dusty, like a bit of hay, but a very very light white floral aspect takes it to makeup powder instead. This is not your-skin-but-better because skin could never really smell like this on its own, it’s too minty. It’s more feminine than unisex, but not overly. This to me reads a bit like a more wearable, less intense version of Fallen Snow Angels: that fragrance is a punch of patchouli, vanilla and mint, this is very gently mixed together cream, mint and white musk. I feel there has to be the tiniest touch of ambergris here? Quite pretty and elegant while still very unique, this is less “I want to smell like my-skin-but-better” (that's Enigma or Supernatural) and more “I want to have a very gentle, clean scent aura”. A bit “clean girl musk” as one may say. **9/10** when judging it on its own merits, because I’m not the biggest skin scents fan and between this and Fallen Snow Angels I’d reach for that one, but if you’re afraid of mint this is much more approachable.

1ofafzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expat/comments/1ofafzk/im_back/,I’m back,"Well I’m back. And things are as absurd and disorganized as I remember them.

The taxi drivers at the Manila airport are scammers.

I smell smoke everywhere I go.

At the mall only the downward moving escalators work. (Sure that totally makes sense. Why make it easier to go against gravity?)

At the supermarket there’s four lanes but only one checker on duty.

You have to stand there and watch as she removes each individual item from the cart and scan it one by one. (Imagine instead of just keying in times 20)

The people are just as rude as I remember too. Following you around and begging you for money the moment they see you. Sitting there in traffic honking their horns (for no reason). Driving just like they walk. Stopping right in front of everyone and then staring off into space blankly.

And the food…the FOOD. If that’s what you want to call it. What a fool I was to stop at a burger restaurant and expect them to actually have a burger in stock. Or coffee. (Out of stock po)

I guess people here think this is a normal way to operate a business.

So far four single mom’s and two legally married women have approached me. Both online and even at the food court personally.

1ofad89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1ofad89/throwing_up_from_cramps/,Throwing up from cramps,"Hi. I’m 27, learned in July i have a 9cm subserosal pedunculated fibroid (behind the uterus). I of course was terrified about this because I dream of having kids in the next 4-5 years. I already have Pcos. I only found out about it because i went for an IUD check up and they found it.

I was told by my doctor these don’t tend to be that problematic but can cause painful period cramps. I noticed my cramps getting worse over the last few months but today was the worst thing i have ever experienced. I’m on day 2 of my period, which I know is always the worst. But today the cramps reached a whole new level, to be fair i am busy at work and only had an iced coffee and piece of toast but I took 2 extra strength Tylenol and it didn’t help. An hour later the pain was so bad i felt like I was going to throw up so i did profusely (mostly saliva as i didn’t eat much). I also have pooped/ felt the need to about 6 times today.

After i puked i was shaking, hot but also had the chills. Finally i took some Advil and had a granola bar and fell asleep and woke up feeling pain free. I live in Canada and i got referred to a MIGS gynaecologist in July and they said 6 months to see him, how am I supposed to go through this every month? I want this thing out and hopefully laparoscopically. 

Has anyone had experience throwing up from the pain? I’m not sure if it’s from taking the Tylenol on an empty stomach or the pain. I’m so upset. ",1,1761342275.0,Fibroids,1,1.0,False
1ofacex,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ofacex/dribbling_crimson_pt_3/,Dribbling Crimson Pt. 3,"The eerie similarity of last night made my skin crawl as I approached the scene. A dose of relief sustained me, knowing the storm kept onlookers inside their homes. Jacinto was waiting at the open door for me, a soft glow illuminating from behind beckoned my arrival. Blitzing through the rain, I shook off droplets on the front porch with the protection provided from the awning above. As I scraped my boots of any excessive moisture, I peered inside the small home. Barbara Locke was seated in a small chair in the living room. She and her husband, Benjamin, have instilled themselves as pillars of the community by being the high school principal and a local judge, respectively. The grays in her hair frizzled outward, distress sending a shockwave to her roots. A steaming mug of tea sat between her pale hands. Her eyes held a stare that would drill through any man’s soul.

I leaned in towards Jacinto, “So what’s the situation?”

Jacinto took off her hat and scratched her head. “Well, it seems to be a missing person case. Checked the garage and both vehicles were there. Along with that, keys, wallet, and shoes were all in their suspected locations. Oh yeah, and the doors and windows were locked when Mrs. Locke came home.”

The click of a camera’s shutter came from down the hall. Jacinto turned her attention towards the noise. “Jefferson is inside the bedroom, taking pictures now. It’s probably best you see for yourself.”

Entering the Locke main bedroom, we were met with Jefferson staring down at a mannequin with his camera. A white flash fluttered across the room, capturing the face of the wooden figure. The facial details, freshly dried paint, were a one-to-one match of Judge Locke. Hazel eyes like a cold desert morning, a head full of black waves dispersed by white beams, and the marked stubble of a tired man. It wore silky crimson pajamas, as if a blood splatter was a fashion statement. The mannequin was prone, with a hand reaching towards the door. A stiff attempt at escape.

I took a stroll around the room, inspecting for anything out of the ordinary. The bed was in disarray, a flurry of blankets and pillows. On the floor, a shattered glass with spots of blood trailing towards the foot of the bed. Crouching down to get a closer look, I caught the lingering sting of alcohol. My senses urged me to investigate the Judge Locke doll with more scrutiny. I crouched down near Deputy Jefferson, glancing over the folds of the judge’s pajamas. I took a pen from my jacket pocket and used its end to pull the shirt up a few inches. Shards of glass penetrated through the wooden form of the doll; a dried blood pattern dragged along the wound. The scent of blood and alcohol stains the mind.

“Jefferson, what’d you find out so far?”

Deputy Jefferson kept his shutterbug position as he spoke up. “As it stands, it seems like Mrs. Locke was out of town visiting her mother for a couple of days. When she returned home, she found this doll as you see before you. Currently, she’s claiming that Judge Locke has been kidnapped. Considering that, I went ahead and asked her what her husband’s agenda has been for the past few days, see if we get any potential leads. That’s when she mentioned Isabella.”

“Gotcha, Jacinto and I are gonna talk to Mrs. Locke and see if we can figure anything else out. You already called the evidence guys?” Jefferson gave a nod. “Good man. Alright, go ahead and give another look around the room to see if anything else pops up. When you’re done with that, maybe take a walk outside. See if you can spot unconventional entrances or exits.”

Jacinto and I made our way back to the living room. Mrs. Locke was locked into the position as we left her. With a soft voice, Jacinto leaned down towards the veteran principal.

“Mrs. Locke, Deputy Ramirez and I wanted to talk with you to see if we can help track down your husband.”

Snapped out of her stupor, “Oh, yes, please take a seat.”

Jacinto and I complied, sitting across from her on the couch.

“Now, if you wouldn’t mind repeating what you’ve told Deputy Jefferson, that would be great.”

A familiar air of annoyance swept across Mrs. Locke’s face. Her scowl that I hadn’t seen since she scolded me for slamming my locker. “Well, I’d figure y’all would be more efficient with your information, but if I must. I had just gotten back from visiting my mother up in San Juan. Ben decided to stay back because he was claiming to be ailed with some acute medical issues.”

I started writing on my notepad, “What kind of medical issues?”

“Fatigue, fever, sluggishness, all the stuff that happens when someone doesn’t get enough sleep.”

“Mr. Locke was struggling with sleep? Nightmares, night terrors, that kind of thing?”

“Yes, he’s a very prideful man, so it was a shock when he gave me a call at such a bizarre time of night. I figured if he really needed help, he should visit the clinic. The next day, he told how he met with Isabella Ramirez – well, that’s your wife, isn’t it, Ramón?”

“Yes, it is, ma’am.”

“Well, at least one of you is useful. Anyway, Ben recollected the terrible dream for her. Describing a dark man sitting in the corner, chewing on Ben’s heart, an utterly grim vision. What I found more interesting is how she got him to talk about anything beyond the dream.” Mrs. Locke leaned in, “He has automatonophobia, anything vaguely human but isn’t, just makes him downright catatonic. I assumed he was feigning the illness just so he wouldn’t have to go to my mother’s house. The thing is full of tailor dolls and the like. Regardless, he said that the night terrors continued, so he went back to the clinic, hoping for some kind of sleep medication. Benjamin and Mrs. Ramirez had another consultation, but she advised against medication until further notice. Instead, she offered to start him on ‘exposure therapy’ as she put it. She suspected that the night terrors had a greater root cause and believed the treatment could be useful to Ben. With that in consideration, Ben said he would let a bit of brandy do the job, and that was the last I heard from him. I was supposed to be home earlier, but traffic was backed up in San Juan.”

Mrs. Locke pouted, staring at a picture of her and Judge Locke on the small coffee table, a photo of the couple’s wedding day.

We allowed a mournful silence to nurture, then I spoke up, “Thank you for sharing that information with us, Mrs. Locke. It will be helpful in the search for your husband. Is there anything else you can recall, anything strange?”

Mrs. Locke continued staring at her and her husband’s portrait before raising her eyes towards mine. “When I first entered the room, I smelled rotting meat.”

Jacinto stood up, “Thank you for your time, Mrs. Locke. We’ll keep you updated as soon as we know anything.” Jacinto and I stepped outside, rain pelted against the wooden awning above us. Normally, the downpour would be the cleansing the town needed but tonight, it stretches the roots of this mystery.

A flicker of flame interrupted my thoughts as Jacinto lit a cigarette.

“I thought you were trying to quit?”

Jacinto took a long drag, conjuring a plume of smoke that dispersed into the night sky. “Something tells me it ain’t a good time to. That doll, it’s chilling that someone could make something so lifelike.”

“I’m not too sure it was made.”

“What are you talking about?”

I adjusted my hat, which seemed to be a bit snugger than I was used to. “You saw the glass and blood on the other side of the bed, right? Well, the doll had glass embedded into the side. Dried blood right alongside it, too.”

Jacinto took another puff. “So, we’re dealing with someone so obsessed with Judge Locke that they wanted to hurt and abduct him? *Mierde*, I thought this town was gonna be lost bikes and weed charges.”

I held hope that Jacinto was right. My mind inched closer to the idea that we were dealing with something more … strange. At least if it were a person, we could arrest them. The lingering stench of brandy in my nostrils and Mrs. Locke’s recollection prevented full assurance of Jacinto’s assertion.

“Hate to leave you with the paperwork again, but you think you can handle it? I need to head home?”

“Gonna talk to Isabella?”

“It’s worth a shot. Maybe it can lead us to our next potential victim, and we can stop whoever is doing this before someone else gets hurt.”

“Alright, let me know if you need anything.”

“Will do.” I walked out towards to my car. Jacinto became a shadow in my rearview mirror, the only sign of life was the small orange glow of her cigarette.",1,1761342214.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

[William](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/vkVIORVVgw) waited patiently for the class to simmer down because right now they were rattling and prattling off at the mouth like the lid to a stainless steel pot on a piping hot stove. A thing as simple and fickle as getting code names had gotten them to stop sulking over their terrible introductions in part 1. William made sure to look over at you just to make sure you were still aboard the Angel Hunters flagship after that shipwreck of an introductory into the supposed wicked world of “Dark Fiction” that the author swears is not quite like any other subgenre and so he just has to call it this. Phew. Okay. You’re still onboard and not overboard somewhere, drowning in an attempt to get the hell away from this ghostship. Great! William thought before starting:

“Lenda. Your code name is Wraith. Nano. Yours is… Nano. And Nero. Yours is ‘the Beast.’ Use your code names any time we are in the field. Hmm. I suppose I should pick one for myself. I’ve never used one considering my stories a bit grittier. Meh. I suppose you could all continue to call me Sensei. Great. Hope everyone likes their name. If not too bad.”

[Nero](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/a7TDu9N3So) rooted and hooted like an unstoppable maniac Animaniac on the loose. Suddenly he paused mid fist pump and hopped from off the top of the desk he had somehow managed to balance himself atop with such great skill. Huh? He didn’t actually know the meaning of his code name ‘the Beast’ he had just spent all this time rooting for like a bloke. I mean there was the guy from Marvel, “Beast,” but that wouldn’t have made any sense because that guy was super smart, and he was... Wait! Was he about to call himself not smart?! Which would imply he was er... never mind.

[Lenda](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/o11K26jhzY) basked in his befuddlement. It was a rare occurrence of quietness from someone usually so skilled at being a nuisance. Feeling sorry for him, she whispered playfully into his ear that she would do him a solid by googling away his vexation. Her fingers went to work. She giggled wildly when his eyes nearly popped out of his head in shock when he saw the search results. It was fitting for a jerk like him she thought. *But* her code name, oh my God! Totally to die for! Seriously she fell head over heels for it as soon as it rolled off the tip of Sensei’s tongue. Think about it. Put her two professions together and it was epic word salad: *“Shinobi Wraith.”*

[Nano](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/gVagctM4c8) watched all of this unfold with a bitter indifference only something or someone who was possessed by the spirit of AI could muster. His blue irises flashed with numbers as he connected to the Core Matrix in a pointless attempt to understand human behavior. If he was going to “destroy you and all of humanity” like he had promised, he would have to understand why you and all of humanity acted the way you did. The realization was bitter and filled with irony as rich as a box of chocolates he couldn’t help but share as he looked over at you with another one of those lovely death stares, he also loved to share, but *not* like a box of chocolates!       

“Settle down class. I have another announcement to make. Now. Before we continue to our field training, I should introduce the person in charge of all major operations. She’s a woman who needs no introduction. The AI Matrix she constructed from the ground up is crucial in maintaining our underground facilities. It also plays a critical role in advancing our ultimate doomsday project. Please applaud the prestigious [Doctor Susan Jane.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/ro92AdVO2s)

William’s longwinded announcement was a bit confusing. It became something of a controversy when he opened the door, and a young girl entered the classroom. She walked over and greeted you rather professionally for a teen. Her smile matched the deepness of her woodland green eyes that burned with curiosity like a forest fire. A know-how like a robin or hoodlum wading through Sherwood Forest. She was a pleasant girl who was hard to forget. Another thing that was hard to forget was how her lab coat barely fit. Her arms had been chewed up by the rolled up, crumpled up sleeves. The bottom of her coat seemed bottomless as it dangled dangerously close to becoming a broken magic carpet. Surely William would explain away the whole thing as some kind of practical joke. Ah. Or maybe the esteemed doctor had been hit with a shrink ray?

William took a step back and gestured with his hand that the floor was hers. Seeing this she gave you one more studious look, William a studious head nod, and then stood studiously before the class. A moment or two was spent flipping and studying the pages secured to her super important clipboard before she cleared her throat and spoke:

“Um. Greetings class. I will be your squad’s coordinating officer. There is a lot to be done, and I’d like to get to work right away. I reviewed all three of your profiles extensively. Each one of you were selected for a reason. So please. Try to take your training seriously. My evil plan depends on the three of you being competent enough to destroy the world. Sounds cliché, doesn’t it? I suppose all supervillains have that one bit in common no matter how ‘realistic’ or ambitious the narrative. But in all seriousness. We are totally going to bring it all crashing down! Starting with America. It’s *so* close to collapsing! All it needs is a teeny-tiny—”

“Is this some kind of joke?” Nero rudely interrupted.

“Why? Was my speech a little too cheeky? Tch. I kind of thought that would be the case. People have been predicting the fall of America for years now. I feared my speech would come off like *the Boy Who Cried Wolf,* or in my case ‘the girl,’” she smiled.

“No. That’s not it.”

“Then what is it?”

“You’re a kid.”

“I’m like five years younger than you.”

“Bah! I’m not taking orders from a kid.”

“Hey, Nero,” Nano said in a flat tone.

“Huh? What do you want AI boy?”

 “If I were you, I would watch how I spoke to her. Don’t let her size fool you. She can turn your life into a living nightmare.”

“Hah! I eat living nightmares for breakfast,” he said with smoldering intensity.

Lenda rolled her eyes and said, “Gah. Do you ever stop?”

“No. I don’t. I escaped from Hell and have been running ever since! I don’t remember my escape, but I was told I did by the angels who found me. That had to be the lowest point in my life. But that’s not the point! The point is... uh. What was the point? Oh yeah. That’s right—what can ‘Doctor Pint-sized’ do to me if Lucy couldn’t stop me from escaping Hell?! That’s right! The angels couldn’t stop me from ditching the Holy Order either! The forces of dark—""

“I’ll tell you what I can do,” Susan smoldered even harder. Her face burning red with anger as she stared him down with a murderous glint in her eye like someone who had carved into a pumpkin with a meat cleaver. “You better take your training serious! The fate of the Illuminati depends on it! If you fail—any of you for that matter—fail to become proper Angel Hunters—you’ll scorn the day you were born. First, I’ll wait for you to sleep, or in your case, Nano, I’ll power you down. I’ll wait too. Heh. I’ll wait until you’re nice and fat with forgetfulness before I have my friend Sarahiel kidnap you and bring you to my lair deep down in the bowels of Bunker 17. Then I’ll trap your body inside the same bio-caskets we use to keep legates alive. But instead of letting you drift away into peaceful cryostasis, I’ll hijack your brain and upload your mind into my virtual reality matrix. Hah! That’s right! My master simulation is nothing like the cheap stuff we allow on the civilian market. What I’ve created feels just like the real thing thanks to my AI Matrix. Not only that, but I can program it to overload your synaptic connections so that you feel pain and fear tenfold natural human biology. Then I’ll override my AI Matrix and make sure you relive your worst freaking nightmare again and again—in slow time for a trillion artificial life cycles!”

Nero fell out of his chair in shock. Lenda covered her eyes and peaked over at her as if she were already trapped inside the living nightmare. Nano smirked for the first time probably ever when he processed their reactions. Then with the same devious smirk hanging from his face, he said, “I won’t let you down, mother. I won’t allow these two knuckleheads to do so either. We will destroy the world even if I have to drag them along kicking and screaming.”

“Good,” the curious doctor said as she happened upon an idea. She placed her pen to her lips and then smirked as she thought about it. “Nano. I think I’m going to make you squad leader.”

Nero jumped to his feet and cried out in protest, “Now hold on a second there! Why does he get to be the leader?! And why did he call you mother?!”

“Because I created him. Duh,” she replied.

“So many questions,” Lenda muttered.

“Now is not the time,” the doc said before turning to you and adding, “I’m sure all of this talk-talk-talk is starting to bore-bore-bore the Neutral Observer because I hate it.” Then she glanced at her clipboard before jotting something down. “Hmm. Are you guys ready for your first mission or what?”

“Yes!” Nero roared. “Let’s take down a guardian angel—no, a cohort of paladins! I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life,” he paused for a moment and glared at Nano, growling, “You better stay out of my way. I’m the chosen one not you. If you get in my way, I’ll show you with my fists why I’m the Beast when I knock a few circuits loose on your motherboard!”

“You’re not as strong as you think,” he replied.

“I’m stronger than you,” Nero fired back.

“No, you’re not,” Nano said.

“There’s only one way to find out.”

“Meh. You’re not worth the effort.”

“Chicken.”

“Rooster.”

*“Whaaa!”* Nero exclaimed as he dashed in front of Nano’s desk at blistering speed. The velocity at which he traveled caused Nano’s long dark ponytail to rustle like a tree branch caught in a violent windstorm. Even the front legs to his desk rattled and rocked. Nero sneered and waved around his fist. His power was undeniable. Almost as undeniable as his tantrums. “You don’t know how bad you just messed up computer boy. Nobody calls me a rooster. *Grr!”*

“I’m shaking in my computer case.”

“Oh yeah?! Meet me outside in the courtyard!”

“Nero, sit down!” the kid doctor shouted.

“He started it first, Wicked Stepmother!”

“Wait. What did you call me?”

“Wicked Stepmother Susan.”

“This is hopeless,” she pouted.

“The name suits you,” William told her.

She couldn’t believe her ears. Not only that but she refused to even acknowledge the smug look on his face. Ever since she had been cloned, her temper had become something of an inside joke. She knew the nick was going to stick. It was only a matter of time before her colleagues down in Bunker 17 found out about it. Her cheeks reddened at the thought and at wanting nothing more than to blow up into a million pieces. “Fine. I suppose I could use a code name too. Even though it’s not really a code name. Thank you, Nero, for your unintentional assistance.”

“Hah! No problem,” he replied.

“Don’t let it happen again!” she erupted.  

“Okay, jeez,” he said before creeping back down in his desk and mumbling, “Wow. Wicked Stepmother really means business. I better be careful.”

Lenda giggled and said, “You don’t have a careful bone in your body.”

“I do have a careful bone!” he retorted.

“It’s not in your skull,” she laughed.

“Stupid ninja girl,” Nero groused like an angry goose.

She stuck her tongue out at him, “Corky rooster.”

Nero threw his hand up in dramatic fashion. It was clear he was trying to get Wicked Stepmother Susan’s attention. She did her best to ignore him, but it was too much. She just couldn’t stand his shenanigans any longer and relented, “What is it now, Nero?”

“Lenda keeps teasing me.”

“Lenda, stop teasing Nero.”

“I will if he stops gaslighting me.”

“Nero, stop gaslighting Lenda.”

The two glared at each other before folding their arms and stewing like a pot of gumbo. The job was going to be tougher than she initially thought, Wicked Stepmother thought to herself with a hint of sadness. She gazed at you, right when doubt was deepest. Her expression said everything and nothing. You could feel her pain, but not really because the whole thing was still kind of new and confusing. Being so blatantly thrown into the line of *fire* like this. I mean. Surely this must seem ridiculous to a mature, knowledgeable, and cultured person such as yourself. It better be because that’s what Wicked Stepmother believed, and Wicked Stepmother was *never* wrong! *Ever!* She could see the smirk on your face. *Err!* Maybe just maybe you were another Nero? This was only the second part to what was going to be a very long series. And your profile was redacted by Ark Haven himself, making you truly a mystery and curiosity as hard to crack as a macadamia.

Yep. She had spiraled but *you* were someone worth spiraling on and on about like a good song. A song that sticks like candy to your teeth. She hoped you were fun to be around like a party with good music. It would be really cool because the two of you could grab ice coffees at Starbucks one day and just talk. Um. Yeah. 13-year-olds drank coffee! Meh. Maybe you were one of those boring adults who objected to drinking coffee because you found everything ‘objectionable’ like Sensei William Chosen. Hmm. Well in that case, she could pick your brain about the Shadow Network, over smoothies, just in case she needed to, um, assassinate one of her rivals.

She just knew that you were special and promised herself that she’d find a way to upload your mind into her AI Matrix. Stealing your brain would be totally worth it! The dopamine rush alone was worth the price of admission. Just image examining and then mapping *your* mind as a unique personality inside of her ultimate simulation. It was an idea that filled her with guilty joy! Almost as much guilty joy as eating an Almond Joy! Oh, or that one time when adult Wicked Stepmother and her DPI colleagues almost reactivated the stolen angelic gateway way back in the day. It was an impossible nut to crack, kind of like you, but getting that clunky artifact going would’ve really kicked their plans for the apocalypse into hyperdrive. Oh well. There’s always tomorrow.

“Hey, Nero,” Nano said in a flat tone.

“Huh? What do you want AI boy?”

 “If I were you, I would watch how I spoke to her. Don’t let her size fool you. She can turn your life into a living nightmare.”

“Hah! I eat living nightmares for breakfast,” he said with smoldering intensity.

Lenda rolled her eyes and said, “Gah. Do you ever stop?”

“No. I don’t. I escaped from Hell and have been running ever since! I don’t remember my escape, but I was told I did by the angels who found me. That had to be the lowest point in my life. But that’s not the point! The point is... uh. What was the point? Oh yeah. That’s right—what can ‘Doctor Pint-sized’ do to me if Lucy couldn’t stop me from escaping Hell?! That’s right! The angels couldn’t stop me from ditching the Holy Order either! The forces of dark—""

“I’ll tell you what I can do,” Susan smoldered even harder. Her face burning red with anger as she stared him down with a murderous glint in her eye like someone who had carved into a pumpkin with a meat cleaver. “You better take your training serious! The fate of the Illuminati depends on it! If you fail—any of you for that matter—fail to become proper Angel Hunters—you’ll scorn the day you were born. First, I’ll wait for you to sleep, or in your case, Nano, I’ll power you down. I’ll wait too. Heh. I’ll wait until you’re nice and fat with forgetfulness before I have my friend Sarahiel kidnap you and bring you to my lair deep down in the bowels of Bunker 17. Then I’ll trap your body inside the same bio-caskets we use to keep legates alive. But instead of letting you drift away into peaceful cryostasis, I’ll hijack your brain and upload your mind into my virtual reality matrix. Hah! That’s right! My master simulation is nothing like the cheap stuff we allow on the civilian market. What I’ve created feels just like the real thing thanks to my AI Matrix. Not only that, but I can program it to overload your synaptic connections so that you feel pain and fear tenfold natural human biology. Then I’ll override my AI Matrix and make sure you relive your worst freaking nightmare again and again—in slow time for a trillion artificial life cycles!”

Nero fell out of his chair in shock. Lenda covered her eyes and peaked over at her as if she were already trapped inside the living nightmare. Nano smirked for the first time probably ever when he processed their reactions. Then with the same devious smirk hanging from his face, he said, “I won’t let you down, mother. I won’t allow these two knuckleheads to do so either. We will destroy the world even if I have to drag them along kicking and screaming.”

“Good,” the curious doctor said as she happened upon an idea. She placed her pen to her lips and then smirked as she thought about it. “Nano. I think I’m going to make you squad leader.”

Nero jumped to his feet and cried out in protest, “Now hold on a second there! Why does he get to be the leader?! And why did he call you mother?!”

“Because I created him. Duh,” she replied.

“So many questions,” Lenda muttered.

“Now is not the time,” the doc said before turning to you and adding, “I’m sure all of this talk-talk-talk is starting to bore-bore-bore the Neutral Observer because I hate it.” Then she glanced at her clipboard before jotting something down. “Hmm. Are you guys ready for your first mission or what?”

“Yes!” Nero roared. “Let’s take down a guardian angel—no, a cohort of paladins! I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life,” he paused for a moment and glared at Nano, growling, “You better stay out of my way. I’m the chosen one not you. If you get in my way, I’ll show you with my fists why I’m the Beast when I knock a few circuits loose on your motherboard!”

“You’re not as strong as you think,” he replied.

“I’m stronger than you,” Nero fired back.

“No, you’re not,” Nano said.

“There’s only one way to find out.”

“Meh. You’re not worth the effort.”

“Chicken.”

“Rooster.”

*“Whaaa!”* Nero exclaimed as he dashed in front of Nano’s desk at blistering speed. The velocity at which he traveled caused Nano’s long dark ponytail to rustle like a tree branch caught in a violent windstorm. Even the front legs to his desk rattled and rocked. Nero sneered and waved around his fist. His power was undeniable. Almost as undeniable as his tantrums. “You don’t know how bad you just messed up computer boy. Nobody calls me a rooster. *Grr!”*

“I’m shaking in my computer case.”

“Oh yeah?! Meet me outside in the courtyard!”

“Nero, sit down!” the kid doctor shouted.

“He started it first, Wicked Stepmother!”

“Wait. What did you call me?”

“Wicked Stepmother Susan.”

“This is hopeless,” she pouted.

“The name suits you,” William told her.

She couldn’t believe her ears. Not only that but she refused to even acknowledge the smug look on his face. Ever since she had been cloned, her temper had become something of an inside joke. She knew the nick was going to stick. It was only a matter of time before her colleagues down in Bunker 17 found out about it. Her cheeks reddened at the thought and at wanting nothing more than to blow up into a million pieces. “Fine. I suppose I could use a code name too. Even though it’s not really a code name. Thank you, Nero, for your unintentional assistance.”

“Hah! No problem,” he replied.

“Don’t let it happen again!” she erupted.  

“Okay, jeez,” he said before creeping back down in his desk and mumbling, “Wow. Wicked Stepmother really means business. I better be careful.”

Lenda giggled and said, “You don’t have a careful bone in your body.”

“I do have a careful bone!” he retorted.

“It’s not in your skull,” she laughed.

“Stupid ninja girl,” Nero groused like an angry goose.

She stuck her tongue out at him, “Corky rooster.”

Nero threw his hand up in dramatic fashion. It was clear he was trying to get Wicked Stepmother Susan’s attention. She did her best to ignore him, but it was too much. She just couldn’t stand his shenanigans any longer and relented, “What is it now, Nero?”

“Lenda keeps teasing me.”

“Lenda, stop teasing Nero.”

“I will if he stops gaslighting me.”

“Nero, stop gaslighting Lenda.”

The two glared at each other before folding their arms and stewing like a pot of gumbo. The job was going to be tougher than she initially thought, Wicked Stepmother thought to herself with a hint of sadness. She gazed at you, right when doubt was deepest. Her expression said everything and nothing. You could feel her pain, but not really because the whole thing was still kind of new and confusing. Being so blatantly thrown into the line of *fire* like this. I mean. Surely this must seem ridiculous to a mature, knowledgeable, and cultured person such as yourself. It better be because that’s what Wicked Stepmother believed, and Wicked Stepmother was *never* wrong! *Ever!* She could see the smirk on your face. *Err!* Maybe just maybe you were another Nero? This was only the second part to what was going to be a very long series. And your profile was redacted by Ark Haven himself, making you truly a mystery and curiosity as hard to crack as a macadamia.

Yep. She had spiraled but *you* were someone worth spiraling on and on about like a good song. A song that sticks like candy to your teeth. She hoped you were fun to be around like a party with good music. It would be really cool because the two of you could grab ice coffees at Starbucks one day and just talk. Um. Yeah. 13-year-olds drank coffee! Meh. Maybe you were one of those boring adults who objected to drinking coffee because you found everything ‘objectionable’ like Sensei William Chosen. Hmm. Well in that case, she could pick your brain about the Shadow Network, over smoothies, just in case she needed to, um, assassinate one of her rivals.

She just knew that you were special and promised herself that she’d find a way to upload your mind into her AI Matrix. Stealing your brain would be totally worth it! The dopamine rush alone was worth the price of admission. Just image examining and then mapping *your* mind as a unique personality inside of her ultimate simulation. It was an idea that filled her with guilty joy! Almost as much guilty joy as eating an Almond Joy! Oh, or that one time when adult Wicked Stepmother and her DPI colleagues almost reactivated the stolen angelic gateway way back in the day. It was an impossible nut to crack, kind of like you, but getting that clunky artifact going would’ve really kicked their plans for the apocalypse into hyperdrive. Oh well. There’s always tomorrow.

1ofaawd,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ofaawd/i_just_understood_the_screening_funcs_t_m/,I just understood the screening func(S) = T + M,"I am gonna be very concise and straightforward here and share my learnings by researching and talking to recruiters.

Given I studied Maths, I sometimes think it's easier to share some basic equations to make it easier (I hope it does)

To start with, getting a job is function of:

1. Getting your resume shortlisted
2. Cracking the process.

**F(Job) = F(Shortlist) + F(Process)**

Now let's focus on the 1st aspect.  
**Function of getting shortlisted.**

**Problem**  
This is where me and most people I know have suffered.  
I would like to share some of my research that I did for past couple of months online and talking to HRs and attending conferences to understand it more.

**Findings:**

I got to know something about ATS systems. What I share may or may not apply to all companies but a subset of it.  
I had applied for certain jobs, and my match score for the job descriptions was **100**% on their ATS boards. Only few people apparently get that. The reason is going to follow below.

**Two** things I realized what I cracked based on my findings, is that the:

1.⁠ **Timing matters** \- Companies often close the position after certain slots are filled say 100-200 applicants so they have time to review and check which are good before its over applied, so if you are not in early applicants you might miss out.  I have cracked this part and reason is going to be shared below.

2.⁠ ⁠⁠**Resume optimization**: ATS boards have integrated scoring mechanisms using traditional + LLM based logics. It’s basic necessity now to hyper optimize it, otherwise if you are not top 90%ile of the applicants there is a good chance you might be auto rejected. So if you are not top application you miss out again. My personal system provided me 90-95% score but on their system its 100%. More on it below.

So far what we have figured out in a very rough way, is that the basic screening process is a function of timing (T) + match score (M). We can remember that with a simple formula.

**F(screening) = F(Timing) + F(Match)**

**Verdict:**

It might not be your fault that you are getting rejected because screening itself has become a game of timing + hyper optimized resume wars. Both sides are using LLMs to optimize and calculate scores before it gets manually reviewed. Without the above = you are probably having a low probability of getting past the system. It's probably like **Tinder** where if you are not timing your newly matched person - you might loose to someone else who initiated the conversation earlier with just a simple Hi. 

I would also suggest avoid using mass ai application tools.

**Quality > Quantity**

You can apply for **500** jobs, and expect **499** rejections as the ATS boards are not stupid. They also have brilliant developers who are building state of the art scanners to remove obvious bs. 

You can source faster, and customize faster, but you need to review them. Atleast with the current state of LLMs. You won't realize what your mass application tools auto generated and you would also be blacklisted for **6-12 months** after your rejection. These tools are meant to make quick buck for themselves I guess. 

**Solution:**  
The equation is clear and you probably realize what needs to be done.

**Personal journey:**

I myself got couple **job offers** in this really bad market and honestly (it was really tough). Being a techie I had more opportunities for getting interviews but how I got them was also through a system I built to solve the same problem. Now you may or may not choose to use it - but I feel I have cracked the above 2 parts of it.

**Function of timing:** As mentioned above, if you are not fast, you already lost. As we are only humans, and not scanning all day long we **WILL** miss that one job that can change your life. This is what I cracked by building job alerts. I have set job alerts to notify me every 3-6 hours once they are posted and usually its only max 5-10 people who have applied by that time. Also the jobs that are sent to me are already scored by the internal algorithm (using maths + LLM) so not all jobs will be pushed, but only the good or excellent matches and will show you a match score. Ofcourse it may not always be the best score as hallucinations do exist, but getting some job recommendation is still better than nothing at all (imho)

**Function of optimizing:** As ATS boards are now relying more on better intelligent scoring mechanisms,  I have also built a hyper resume optimizer which can be edited before you download and apply. That's why I got shortlisted to 50 companies in the last month and was basically on 2-3 calls everyday for the whole month. Earlier I thought my resume was quite optimized and was seeing insane amounts of auto-rejects, because even if you miss a single honest keyword like ""**Typescript**"" it could lead to a bad score. Once I optimized I saw a better conversion ratio.

I used to design interview rounds and conduct them for all the companies I have worked with but that is Part 2 when you actually get screened. The system right now is not fair and is more based on algorithms. You need algorithms to beat it as well.

**Final plug:**

As I said you may choose any system of your liking to manage these. If you'd wanna use mine, its called butterjobs. Currently free. Even if later I do decide to add payment because my scoring functions against 100s of jobs are quite expensive and, I hope paying for 2 cups of coffee worth so that you can land an interview shouldn't be a big deal? Right? Sorry I am not best in this, I am a techie and I know how to build, not sell. Anyhow...

I hope my findings are helpful and you all at the least get through the basic **F(screening).**  
**Just remember to solve for T+M.**

Happy buttery job hunting.

1ofaasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AlamoWaterSofteners/comments/1ofaasa/the_pros_and_cons_of_cooking_with_reverse_osmosis/,The Pros and Cons of Cooking With Reverse Osmosis Water,"Since you invested in a reverse osmosis (RO) filtration system for your drinking water, you’re enjoying cleaner, better-tasting hydration every day. But when it comes to cooking, you might wonder, should you also be using RO water for boiling pasta, making soups, or preparing coffee?

On the surface, it seems like a no-brainer: purer water must be better for cooking, right? The answer isn’t quite that simple. While reverse osmosis offers a long list of benefits, it also has a few trade-offs that may affect your food’s flavor, texture, and even nutritional content.

To help you decide whether RO water deserves a place in your kitchen pot as well as your glass, let’s walk through the clear advantages and potential drawbacks of cooking with reverse osmosis water.

Haven’t taken the leap and invested in an RO system for your home yet? You can simply type “reverse osmosis systems near me” into your web browser to connect you with a local water expert.

# What Is Reverse Osmosis Water and How Is It Different?

Reverse osmosis is a water purification process that uses pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane. This membrane filters out contaminants such as heavy metals, fluoride, chlorine, PFAS, nitrates, and bacteria, removing over 90% to 99% of dissolved solids.

The result is incredibly pure water. However, because it removes both harmful contaminants and beneficial minerals, RO water is significantly different from what comes out of a standard tap.

That ultra-clean quality is exactly what makes RO water so appealing, and also what gives it a controversial edge when it comes to cooking.

# Pros of Cooking with Reverse Osmosis Water

One of the biggest advantages of using RO water in the kitchen is the improvement in taste and clarity. If your tap water has a noticeable odor or flavor because of chlorine, sulfur, or metal content, those impurities can affect the taste of your food. Using RO water strips away those unwanted elements, allowing the natural flavors of your ingredients to shine.

For example, when you make coffee or tea with RO water, you’ll notice a smoother, cleaner flavor. The bitterness you might be used to can often come from minerals or chemicals reacting with your coffee grounds or tea leaves. Similarly, soups and broths made with purified water allow herbs, spices, and fresh ingredients to taste more vibrant and true to form.

Another benefit is the purity of your cooking water when boiling grains, pasta, or vegetables. If you’re steaming broccoli or boiling rice, you don’t want unwanted contaminants clinging to your food. RO water eliminates concerns about ingesting trace amounts of lead, fluoride, or other substances lurking in unfiltered water.

Additionally, if you’re using RO water, you’ll end up with cleaner results overall. It’s also gentler on cookware and appliances, since it reduces the mineral buildup that often results from hard tap water.

# Cons of Cooking with Reverse Osmosis Water

Despite its many advantages, you should understand a few important trade-offs before switching entirely to RO water for cooking.

The first issue is the lack of naturally occurring minerals. Because RO systems strip out calcium, magnesium, potassium, and other trace elements, the water can be described as “dead” or “empty” from a nutritional standpoint. While this might not matter much for hydration, especially if you’re eating a balanced diet, the absence of minerals in cooking water can affect both the flavor and texture of food.

Boiling pasta or grains in mineral-free water may result in a slightly different consistency. Bread dough, for instance, may rise differently if you’re using RO water in your baking. Some professional bakers and chefs prefer mineral-rich water for that reason, especially when texture and fermentation are important.

Additionally, RO water is slightly more acidic than tap water due to the removal of buffering minerals. While not dangerous, this pH change can subtly alter cooking outcomes over time, especially in recipes that depend on precise chemistry, such as sauces or baked goods.

There’s also the question of waste. RO systems can discharge a significant amount of water as part of the filtration process. If you’re using large quantities of RO water to boil or simmer food, you may be creating more wastewater than necessary. This waste is worth considering if conservation is important to you.

# When You Should Use RO Water in Cooking

So how do you decide when to use reverse osmosis water and when to stick with regular tap or filtered water? It depends on your priorities and the specific cooking task.

Use RO water when:

* You’re making beverages like coffee, tea, or lemonade, and want a more pure taste
* You’re preparing delicate recipes where water flavor noticeably alters the end result
* You’re cooking for someone with compromised immunity or health sensitivities to contaminants
* Your local tap water is known to have high levels of pollutants, chlorine, or an unpleasant taste

On the other hand, you might skip RO water for:

* Boiling pasta or vegetables, where flavor impact is minimal
* Baking bread or pastries that rely on mineral balance for texture and rise
* Large-volume cooking where water waste is a concern

# How to Get the Best of Both Worlds

If you want the purity of RO water but have concerns about lost minerals, there’s a simple fix: look for a [reverse osmosis system](https://www.alamowatersofteners.com/reverse-osmosis-system/) that includes a remineralization stage. This feature adds essential minerals back into the water after filtration, improving the taste and restoring a more balanced pH.

Some people also choose to use RO water selectively, keeping it for drinking and sensitive cooking applications. Then, they rely on their [water softener](https://www.alamowatersofteners.com/water-softener-systems/) and water filtration system for their home for tasks like boiling potatoes or cooking pasta.

You can even test the difference yourself. Try cooking the same dish twice, once with tap water and once with RO water, and taste the results side by side. You might be surprised by how noticeable the flavor and texture changes can be.

# Optimizing Reverse Osmosis in Your Kitchen

Reverse osmosis water is a powerful tool for anyone looking to improve their home’s water quality. It gives you confidence that the water you’re drinking and using is clean, free of harmful contaminants, and safer for sensitive applications. But like any tool, it has strengths and limits, especially when used in the kitchen.

By understanding the pros and cons of cooking with RO water, you can make smarter decisions about when and how to use it. Whether you’re brewing the perfect cup of coffee or just trying to make a healthier meal, choosing the right water makes all the difference.

So go ahead, embrace the clarity and control that RO water brings to your kitchen, but stay flexible in how you use it. With the right balance, you can enjoy the benefits of clean water without sacrificing the texture, flavor, or quality of your favorite recipes.

I’ve been seeing a guy from work (34M) — we actually first connected at the gym and things have been… kind of casual but consistent? It’s been over a month now, though part of that time he was away traveling. Most of our time together ends up being spontaneous post-gym drinks that lead back to my place.

The only “planned” time was recently, when **I** made dinner at my place. I spent all day prepping and even planned breakfast for the next morning… but he still rushed out first thing without even staying for coffee. He always leaves early like that — no real lingering or morning time together.

What’s confusing is he *does* say he likes me and he treats me when we go out. He’s been opening up slowly, and I can see some progress… but is it enough?

A week has passed now since the dinner and he hasn’t mentioned planning a date or doing something thoughtful in return. We’ve messaged, but that’s it. I’m half-expecting a last-minute “want to hang out tonight?” text — if anything at all.

I guess what’s going through my mind is:

\- Would a man who’s genuinely interested behave like this?  
\- Is this just his personality — slow to open up and express effort?  
\- Am I rushing it or ignoring red flags?  
\- Am I just wasting my time on someone who doesn’t actually want to build something real?

I’d love some honest perspectives. It’s hard to know if I should give this more time or stop giving so much energy to someone who isn’t fully showing up.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts! 💛

*By The Sports Oracle with a Side of Sarcasm*

The Premier League’s 9th round throws down a classic underdog vs. titan clash: **Chelsea** (favorites) vs. **Sunderland** (the team that once lost 5-1 here and still thinks it’s 2016). Let’s dissect this with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Chelsea’s Bookmakers Are Smug

The betting market is as clear as mud—*literally*. Chelsea’s odds range from **1.34 to 1.40** (decimal), implying a **71-74% chance to win**. Sunderland’s a long shot at **7.3 to 9.0** (11-13%), while the draw sits at **4.6 to 5.16** (19-21%). Add it up, and the bookmakers’ vigorish is about as thick as a West Brom defender’s skull.

The spread? Chelsea’s -1.25 to -1.5 goals. They’re expected to win by *at least* two, which feels generous if you’ve seen Sunderland’s defense. The over/under is **2.5-2.75 goals**, with the over priced at **1.68-1.93** (53-56% implied). Translation: Bookies think this’ll be a high-scoring romp for the Blues.

### News Digest: Mudryk’s Doping Drama and Sunderland’s Existential Crisis

Chelsea’s star Ukrainian winger **Mykhailo Mudryk** is out due to a doping violation. Not injured, not suspended for tripping over his shoelaces—*doping*. The man’s so desperate for attention, he’s probably doping for the *suspension*. Without him, Chelsea loses a key creative spark, but they’ve got enough firepower to make Sunderland’s defense look like a sieve.

Sunderland? Their “news” is as thrilling as a tax audit. No major injuries, no transfers, and no coherent strategy beyond hoping

There's a special kind of panic that comes from realizing your roommate is on a first-name basis with the Grim Reaper.

Alex had thought he'd reached peak supernatural weirdness. He'd accepted the immortal roommate, the ageless wife, and the closet of world-historical relics. His last shred of doubt was a distant memory.

But when he came home from his soul-crushing data analyst job to find John sipping tea with a guy who’d stepped out of a gothic novel, Alex's reality didn’t just crack; it shattered.

# The Odd Man and the Tea Party

It was a dreary Wednesday evening, and Alex trudged into the Brooklyn apartment, ready to collapse after a day of spreadsheets and a boss who thought “urgent” meant “yell at Alex.” He expected John to be there, maybe polishing his “prop” sword or humming a sea shanty from 1712. Instead, he walked into a scene straight out of a Tim Burton fever dream. 

John was at the kitchen table, pouring tea from a porcelain teapot that looked older than the pyramids, chatting with a man who made Alex’s skin crawl.The guy was tall—too tall, like he’d been stretched by a medieval rack. 

His posture was weirdly stiff, as if his spine had forgotten how to bend. He wore a three-piece suit, immaculate but outdated, like something a Victorian undertaker would wear to a funeral. 

His skin was pale, not corpse-like but close, with a waxy sheen that caught the low light of the apartment’s flickering bulbs. His eyes were the worst: too still, like they didn’t blink enough, and when they locked onto Alex, he felt like his soul was being audited. 

The guy’s hands, wrapped around a teacup, were long and bony, with nails that were just a tad too sharp.

John looked up, unfazed as ever. “Oh, hey, Alex! Meet my old friend, Morton Graves. Just catching up.” 

Alex froze, his backpack sliding off his shoulder with a thud. Morton Graves? His brain, sharpened by months of decoding John’s lies, kicked into overdrive. Mort—Latin for “death.” Graves—as in, where dead people end up. This wasn’t just a creepy dude named Morton. This was Death. The Grim Reaper. Sipping Earl Grey in their kitchen like it was book club night.

“Uh… hi?” Alex squeaked, his voice hitting a pitch reserved for karaoke disasters. Morton turned those unblinking eyes on him and smiled—a smile that was polite but felt like it could sign your death certificate. “A pleasure, Alexander,” he said, his voice low and smooth, like gravel wrapped in velvet. 

Alex hadn’t told him his name. His knees wobbled.

# The Name Game and Alex’s Panic

Alex wasn’t dumb. He’d spent months piecing together John’s immortal puzzle—swords, crowns, military papers, Merlin’s ageless face. So when John introduced “Morton Graves,” his brain lit up like a conspiracy theorist’s corkboard. Mort. Graves. Death. Grim Reaper. 

It wasn’t a stretch; it was a neon sign. This guy wasn’t here to borrow sugar. He was here to collect souls, or at least to remind John that immortality came with a VIP pass to dodge the scythe.

Alex sat—more like collapsed—onto the couch, pretending to check his phone while eavesdropping. John and Morton were chatting like old war buddies, which, given John’s Civil War medals, wasn’t impossible. “Remember that mess in Pompeii?” Morton said, stirring his tea with a spoon that looked suspiciously like bone. 

John chuckled. “Yeah, you were not happy about the cleanup.” Alex’s blood ran cold. Pompeii? As in, Vesuvius, 79 CE? Was Morton there, reaping souls while John… what, dodged lava?

Morton’s laugh was a dry rasp, like leaves on a crypt floor. “You owe me for that one, Harrow. And the Black Death? You and Merlin made my job harder than it needed to be.” John grinned, passing a plate of Merlin’s cookies (because of course she’d left a batch). 

“We were just trying to help. No hard feelings.” Alex’s phone slipped from his hand. The Black Death? John and Merlin were running around during the plague? And Morton—Death—was complaining about it like it was a bad day at the office?

# The Grim Reaper’s Chill Vibes

Despite the whole “I’m the personification of mortality” vibe, Morton was… polite. Creepily so. He complimented the apartment’s “rustic charm” (it was a dump) and asked Alex about his job with an interest that felt like he was sizing up his lifespan. 

“Data analysis, fascinating,” Morton said, those still eyes boring into Alex. “Numbers are eternal, in a way. Like some people.” He glanced at John, who coughed and offered more tea.

Alex wanted to bolt, but his legs were jelly. Instead, he grabbed a cookie and mumbled, “So, uh, how do you two know each other?” John, predictably, deflected. “Old friends. Met at a… history convention.” 

Morton’s lips twitched, like he was suppressing a laugh that could end the world. “Yes, a convention. I’ve always been fond of John’s… longevity.” 

The way he said “longevity” made Alex’s hair stand on end. John just smirked and changed the subject to the weather, because of course he did.

The weirdest part? Morton didn’t act like a cartoon Grim Reaper. No hooded cloak, no scythe (though Alex swore he saw a shadow on the wall that looked suspiciously pointy). He was more like a bureaucrat of the afterlife, sipping tea and reminiscing about disasters like they were office gossip. 

But every move he made—too precise, too deliberate—screamed not human. When he stood to leave, his shadow seemed to linger a second too long, and Alex swore the room got colder.

# The Aftermath and Alex’s Breaking Point

Morton left with a handshake that made Alex feel like he’d aged a decade. “Until we meet again, Alexander,” he said, and Alex prayed that wasn’t a promise. 

John walked Morton to the door, whispering something that sounded like, “Tell her I said hi.” Her? Merlin? The Devil? Fate itself? Alex didn’t want to know.

As soon as the door closed, Alex rounded on John. “Morton Graves? Really? You’re drinking tea with the Grim Reaper? What’s next, John? Is Santa Claus coming for Taco Tuesday?” 

John, unfazed, started washing the teacups. “Grim Reaper? Nah, Morton’s just a guy I know. Bit pale, sure, but he’s harmless. Want tacos now?” 

Alex threw up his hands. “You fought in the Civil War, crashed a police database, and now you’re buddies with Death! Stop gaslighting me!”

John’s smile didn’t waver. “You’re stressed, man. Let’s play Smash Bros.” Alex wanted to scream, but the smell of Merlin’s cookies still lingered, and John was already heating up leftover chili. 

He texted Sarah: “JOHN HAD TEA WITH THE GRIM REAPER. NAMED MORTON GRAVES. I’M MOVING TO MARS.” Sarah’s reply was a string of skull emojis and, “GET HIS DNA. WE’RE CALLING MYTHBUSTERS.”

Alex didn’t get Morton’s DNA. He didn’t even get answers. But he ate the chili, because it was delicious, and John promised to make waffles tomorrow. He was 1000% sure John was immortal, Merlin was his eternal accomplice, and Morton was Death himself, probably on a coffee break from reaping. 

The rent was still cheap, the food was divine, and Alex wasn’t ready to face the void of moving out. But if John ever invited the Four Horsemen over for poker night, Alex was packing his bags and calling Sarah. And maybe an exorcist. Just in case.",1,1761342030.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

We hate the gray floors but cannot change it. So we don’t want anything that will bring out more gray.

So I work at a small cafe, and for the past few weeks it just been me and the owner working, and I just finished my training 3 weeks ago.

We had 3 people quit/get fired at all the same time (A couple and their friend), and so now im the only employee besides the Owner and this one girl who only works saturdays whos still being trained. Im drained. Im tired. I loved my job so much and now im just worn out and stressed out. I feel like i cant call out and what if i get sick? Im the only employee. I went from 12-16 hours a week to 32, which means even working everyday all day im still not even a full time employee technically, and this is my first real job. I start college in January and I dont even know what we’re gonna do then. 

Boss doesn’t plan on hiring because winter is slow and I get that but we also do more than just coffee and we cant have two people all on Coffee, Sandwiches, and register at once??? We do get slow, and I get that she cant pay extra money to someone to do nothing but when we’re busy we’re BUSY and its overwhelming. We’ll have one person running between drinks and register and the other on sandwiches. which delays breads and pastries from being baked and formed together. It’s just a mess.

Idk, this may seem silly cause like its my job, I LOVE my job and I get more hours and dont split tip pool anymore so i SHOULD be happy and I think thats what effecting me as well?? Everyones like oh more money!! Or Oh!! You wanted more hours!! but I also want help. I want coworkers. I want to be able to call out if I need to. My brothers getting married and I dont think ill be able to attend. Im just tired, and burnt out. I hope we hire someone soon. 
Idk im probably missing something but I have no other baristas to talk to about this so it feels nice to say it somewhere where other people understand.

 
TLDR: Im basically the only employee besides my boss at my job and Im tired and burnt out and want a nap. ",2,1761341694.0,barista,1,1.0,False
1ofa54h,https://www.reddit.com/r/exAdventist/comments/1ofa54h/sabbath_breakers_club_october_24_and_25/,Sabbath Breakers Club: October 24 and 25,"I wrote this short essay about how I was taught to fit in and be agreeable from a young age and thought most people here could relate to some degree:

I was born into a system. Taught to fit in from an early age. Stay quiet, cheerful, laugh when the old men tell jokes.

In nature, camouflage grew from a need to survive. In the church, it’s a need to be accepted. So, be modest, polite, have the same opinions as everyone else, and you’ll fit in. 

But be warned, if you say the wrong thing, do the wrong thing, or someone spreads a rumor about the wrong thing, you’re an outsider. Sure, they’ll still smile and be polite but the conversations will be shorter. You won’t be invited to Bible studies or sabbath dinners. You’ll be all alone in a crowded room.

So blend in, be polite, laugh at the old man’s jokes. Be nice when he comes onto you. Dress even more modestly. Say yes when you’re asked to lead the song service or do children’s story or special music. Help clean up after potluck. Do it all with a smile. And never let on that you’re not who you appear to be when you step into that red-carpeted foyer.

There is another option. You can always leave the church. Go out into that sinful world where Satan rules all. You’ll become a prostitute or a Satan-worshipper or an alcoholic.

Well, shit! I lost my faith reading the Bible and the prophet’s many books. So I went out into the world and instead of evil, I found acceptance. 

I’m still trying to shed my camouflage. Colorful makeup and pierced ears show I’m no longer in the church, but what will take much longer is the quiet people pleaser who laughs at old men’s jokes.

**\[Nero 02:  New Recruits (P2)\]**

[William](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/vkVIORVVgw) waited patiently for the class to simmer down because right now they were rattling and prattling off at the mouth like the lid to a stainless steel pot on a piping hot stove. A thing as simple and fickle as getting code names had gotten them to stop sulking over their terrible introductions in part 1. William made sure to look over at you just to make sure you were still aboard the Angel Hunters flagship after that shipwreck of an introductory into the supposed wicked world of “Dark Fiction” that the author swears is not quite like any other subgenre and so he just has to call it this. Phew. Okay. You’re still onboard and not overboard somewhere, drowning in an attempt to get the hell away from this ghostship. Great! William thought before starting:

“Lenda. Your code name is Wraith. Nano. Yours is… Nano. And Nero. Yours is ‘the Beast.’ Use your code names any time we are in the field. Hmm. I suppose I should pick one for myself. I’ve never used one considering my stories a bit grittier. Meh. I suppose you could all continue to call me Sensei. Great. Hope everyone likes their name. If not too bad.”

[Nero](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/a7TDu9N3So) rooted and hooted like an unstoppable maniac Animaniac on the loose. Suddenly he paused mid fist pump and hopped from off the top of the desk he had somehow managed to balance himself atop with such great skill. Huh? He didn’t actually know the meaning of his code name ‘the Beast’ he had just spent all this time rooting for like a bloke. I mean there was the guy from Marvel, “Beast,” but that wouldn’t have made any sense because that guy was super smart, and he was... Wait! Was he about to call himself not smart?! Which would imply he was er... never mind.

[Lenda](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/o11K26jhzY) basked in his befuddlement. It was a rare occurrence of quietness from someone usually so skilled at being a nuisance. Feeling sorry for him, she whispered playfully into his ear that she would do him a solid by googling away his vexation. Her fingers went to work. She giggled wildly when his eyes nearly popped out of his head in shock when he saw the search results. It was fitting for a jerk like him she thought. *But* her code name, oh my God! Totally to die for! Seriously she fell head over heels for it as soon as it rolled off the tip of Sensei’s tongue. Think about it. Put her two professions together and it was epic word salad: *“Shinobi Wraith.”*

[Nano](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/gVagctM4c8) watched all of this unfold with a bitter indifference only something or someone who was possessed by the spirit of AI could muster. His blue irises flashed with numbers as he connected to the Core Matrix in a pointless attempt to understand human behavior. If he was going to “destroy you and all of humanity” like he had promised, he would have to understand why you and all of humanity acted the way you did. The realization was bitter and filled with irony as rich as a box of chocolates he couldn’t help but share as he looked over at you with another one of those lovely death stares, he also loved to share, but *not* like a box of chocolates!       

“Settle down class. I have another announcement to make. Now. Before we continue to our field training, I should introduce the person in charge of all major operations. She’s a woman who needs no introduction. The AI Matrix she constructed from the ground up is crucial in maintaining our underground facilities. It also plays a critical role in advancing our ultimate doomsday project. Please applaud the prestigious [Doctor Susan Jane.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/ro92AdVO2s)

William’s longwinded announcement was a bit confusing. It became something of a controversy when he opened the door, and a young girl entered the classroom. She walked over and greeted you rather professionally for a teen. Her smile matched the deepness of her woodland green eyes that burned with curiosity like a forest fire. A know-how like a robin or hoodlum wading through Sherwood Forest. She was a pleasant girl who was hard to forget. Another thing that was hard to forget was how her lab coat barely fit. Her arms had been chewed up by the rolled up, crumpled up sleeves. The bottom of her coat seemed bottomless as it dangled dangerously close to becoming a broken magic carpet. Surely William would explain away the whole thing as some kind of practical joke. Ah. Or maybe the esteemed doctor had been hit with a shrink ray?

William took a step back and gestured with his hand that the floor was hers. Seeing this she gave you one more studious look, William a studious head nod, and then stood studiously before the class. A moment or two was spent flipping and studying the pages secured to her super important clipboard before she cleared her throat and spoke:

“Um. Greetings class. I will be your squad’s coordinating officer. There is a lot to be done, and I’d like to get to work right away. I reviewed all three of your profiles extensively. Each one of you were selected for a reason. So please. Try to take your training seriously. My evil plan depends on the three of you being competent enough to destroy the world. Sounds cliché, doesn’t it? I suppose all supervillains have that one bit in common no matter how ‘realistic’ or ambitious the narrative. But in all seriousness. We are totally going to bring it all crashing down! Starting with America. It’s *so* close to collapsing! All it needs is a teeny-tiny—”

“Is this some kind of joke?” Nero rudely interrupted.

“Why? Was my speech a little too cheeky? Tch. I kind of thought that would be the case. People have been predicting the fall of America for years now. I feared my speech would come off like *the Boy Who Cried Wolf,* or in my case ‘the girl,’” she smiled.

“No. That’s not it.”

“Then what is it?”

“You’re a kid.”

“I’m like five years younger than you.”

“Bah! I’m not taking orders from a kid.”

“Hey, Nero,” Nano said in a flat tone.

“Huh? What do you want AI boy?”

 “If I were you, I would watch how I spoke to her. Don’t let her size fool you. She can turn your life into a living nightmare.”

“Hah! I eat living nightmares for breakfast,” he said with smoldering intensity.

Lenda rolled her eyes and said, “Gah. Do you ever stop?”

“No. I don’t. I escaped from Hell and have been running ever since! I don’t remember my escape, but I was told I did by the angels who found me. That had to be the lowest point in my life. But that’s not the point! The point is... uh. What was the point? Oh yeah. That’s right—what can ‘Doctor Pint-sized’ do to me if Lucy couldn’t stop me from escaping Hell?! That’s right! The angels couldn’t stop me from ditching the Holy Order either! The forces of dark—""

“I’ll tell you what I can do,” Susan smoldered even harder. Her face burning red with anger as she stared him down with a murderous glint in her eye like someone who had carved into a pumpkin with a meat cleaver. “You better take your training serious! The fate of the Illuminati depends on it! If you fail—any of you for that matter—fail to become proper Angel Hunters—you’ll scorn the day you were born. First, I’ll wait for you to sleep, or in your case, Nano, I’ll power you down. I’ll wait too. Heh. I’ll wait until you’re nice and fat with forgetfulness before I have my friend Sarahiel kidnap you and bring you to my lair deep down in the bowels of Bunker 17. Then I’ll trap your body inside the same bio-caskets we use to keep legates alive. But instead of letting you drift away into peaceful cryostasis, I’ll hijack your brain and upload your mind into my virtual reality matrix. Hah! That’s right! My master simulation is nothing like the cheap stuff we allow on the civilian market. What I’ve created feels just like the real thing thanks to my AI Matrix. Not only that, but I can program it to overload your synaptic connections so that you feel pain and fear tenfold natural human biology. Then I’ll override my AI Matrix and make sure you relive your worst freaking nightmare again and again—in slow time for a trillion artificial life cycles!”

Nero fell out of his chair in shock. Lenda covered her eyes and peaked over at her as if she were already trapped inside the living nightmare. Nano smirked for the first time probably ever when he processed their reactions. Then with the same devious smirk hanging from his face, he said, “I won’t let you down, mother. I won’t allow these two knuckleheads to do so either. We will destroy the world even if I have to drag them along kicking and screaming.”

“Good,” the curious doctor said as she happened upon an idea. She placed her pen to her lips and then smirked as she thought about it. “Nano. I think I’m going to make you squad leader.”

Nero jumped to his feet and cried out in protest, “Now hold on a second there! Why does he get to be the leader?! And why did he call you mother?!”

“Because I created him. Duh,” she replied.

“So many questions,” Lenda muttered.

“Now is not the time,” the doc said before turning to you and adding, “I’m sure all of this talk-talk-talk is starting to bore-bore-bore the Neutral Observer because I hate it.” Then she glanced at her clipboard before jotting something down. “Hmm. Are you guys ready for your first mission or what?”

“Yes!” Nero roared. “Let’s take down a guardian angel—no, a cohort of paladins! I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life,” he paused for a moment and glared at Nano, growling, “You better stay out of my way. I’m the chosen one not you. If you get in my way, I’ll show you with my fists why I’m the Beast when I knock a few circuits loose on your motherboard!”

“You’re not as strong as you think,” he replied.

“I’m stronger than you,” Nero fired back.

“No, you’re not,” Nano said.

“There’s only one way to find out.”

“Meh. You’re not worth the effort.”

“Chicken.”

“Rooster.”

*“Whaaa!”* Nero exclaimed as he dashed in front of Nano’s desk at blistering speed. The velocity at which he traveled caused Nano’s long dark ponytail to rustle like a tree branch caught in a violent windstorm. Even the front legs to his desk rattled and rocked. Nero sneered and waved around his fist. His power was undeniable. Almost as undeniable as his tantrums. “You don’t know how bad you just messed up computer boy. Nobody calls me a rooster. *Grr!”*

“I’m shaking in my computer case.”

“Oh yeah?! Meet me outside in the courtyard!”

“Nero, sit down!” the kid doctor shouted.

“He started it first, Wicked Stepmother!”

“Wait. What did you call me?”

“Wicked Stepmother Susan.”

“This is hopeless,” she pouted.

“The name suits you,” William told her.

She couldn’t believe her ears. Not only that but she refused to even acknowledge the smug look on his face. Ever since she had been cloned, her temper had become something of an inside joke. She knew the nick was going to stick. It was only a matter of time before her colleagues down in Bunker 17 found out about it. Her cheeks reddened at the thought and at wanting nothing more than to blow up into a million pieces. “Fine. I suppose I could use a code name too. Even though it’s not really a code name. Thank you, Nero, for your unintentional assistance.”

“Hah! No problem,” he replied.

“Don’t let it happen again!” she erupted.  

“Okay, jeez,” he said before creeping back down in his desk and mumbling, “Wow. Wicked Stepmother really means business. I better be careful.”

Lenda giggled and said, “You don’t have a careful bone in your body.”

“I do have a careful bone!” he retorted.

“It’s not in your skull,” she laughed.

“Stupid ninja girl,” Nero groused like an angry goose.

She stuck her tongue out at him, “Corky rooster.”

Nero threw his hand up in dramatic fashion. It was clear he was trying to get Wicked Stepmother Susan’s attention. She did her best to ignore him, but it was too much. She just couldn’t stand his shenanigans any longer and relented, “What is it now, Nero?”

“Lenda keeps teasing me.”

“Lenda, stop teasing Nero.”

“I will if he stops gaslighting me.”

“Nero, stop gaslighting Lenda.”

The two glared at each other before folding their arms and stewing like a pot of gumbo. The job was going to be tougher than she initially thought, Wicked Stepmother thought to herself with a hint of sadness. She gazed at you, right when doubt was deepest. Her expression said everything and nothing. You could feel her pain, but not really because the whole thing was still kind of new and confusing. Being so blatantly thrown into the line of *fire* like this. I mean. Surely this must seem ridiculous to a mature, knowledgeable, and cultured person such as yourself. It better be because that’s what Wicked Stepmother believed, and Wicked Stepmother was *never* wrong! *Ever!* She could see the smirk on your face. *Err!* Maybe just maybe you were another Nero? This was only the second part to what was going to be a very long series. And your profile was redacted by Ark Haven himself, making you truly a mystery and curiosity as hard to crack as a macadamia.

Yep. She had spiraled but *you* were someone worth spiraling on and on about like a good song. A song that sticks like candy to your teeth. She hoped you were fun to be around like a party with good music. It would be really cool because the two of you could grab ice coffees at Starbucks one day and just talk. Um. Yeah. 13-year-olds drank coffee! Meh. Maybe you were one of those boring adults who objected to drinking coffee because you found everything ‘objectionable’ like Sensei William Chosen. Hmm. Well in that case, she could pick your brain about the Shadow Network, over smoothies, just in case she needed to, um, assassinate one of her rivals.

She just knew that you were special and promised herself that she’d find a way to upload your mind into her AI Matrix. Stealing your brain would be totally worth it! The dopamine rush alone was worth the price of admission. Just image examining and then mapping *your* mind as a unique personality inside of her ultimate simulation. It was an idea that filled her with guilty joy! Almost as much guilty joy as eating an Almond Joy! Oh, or that one time when adult Wicked Stepmother and her DPI colleagues almost reactivated the stolen angelic gateway way back in the day. It was an impossible nut to crack, kind of like you, but getting that clunky artifact going would’ve really kicked their plans for the apocalypse into hyperdrive. Oh well. There’s always tomorrow.

I'm a university student (22M) finally decided to shoot my shot with my crush who I’ve liked for months. We’ve talked a lot in class, and she's always been nice to me and laughed at my jokes. I thought maybe I’ll just ask her out.

After class I caught her outside and said something like, “Hey, I was wondering if you’d want to grab a coffee sometime?” She literally made a face like she smelled something gross and said, “Uh… no. I don’t see you that way. At all.” Then she just walked off before I could even respond.

I stood there like an idiot, trying to pretend I didn’t just get completely wrecked in public. A couple people nearby definitely saw it happen too. I ended up walking to my car in silence, replaying it over and over in my head. I wasn’t expecting her to say yes, but damn, I didn’t expect her to look disgusted either.

Now I’m dreading going back to class next week because I know it’s gonna be awkward as hell.

1ofa0du,https://www.reddit.com/r/alphaandbetausers/comments/1ofa0du/iosandroid_beta_a_messenger_with_a_builtin_brain/,"[iOS/Android Beta] A messenger with a built-in ""brain."" We're testing Farflung, an AI chat app that replaces app-switching.","Hey r/AlphaandBetausers,

You know that feeling. You're in a group chat. You need to find a movie time, get a link for a restaurant, or just an answer to a simple question. You leave the chat, open a browser, search, copy the link, paste it back... it's constant digital busywork.

We're building [**Farflung.AI**](http://Farflung.AI) to fix this.

It's an **AI-native messenger** that combines your chat, search, recommendations, and planning tools all in one place. It’s the all-in-one space for your social life and personal assistance.

# How it Works:

**1. It's a Full-Fledged Messenger** First, it's a real messenger. You get 1:1 chats with friends, group chats, and you can even chat 1:1 directly with the Farflung AI for help.

**2. A ""Brain"" for Your Chat (The ""In-Chat Apps"")** Instead of app-switching, you just ask Farflung right in the chat:

* **Instant Search:** Ask it *any* question: ""What are the reviews for that new movie?"" or ""What are some good events this weekend?"" and get fast answers.
* **Smart Recommendations:** Ask for ""a good coffee shop near me"". You'll get rich info with ratings, photos, and directions right in the app.
* **Link Summaries:** Drop a link into the chat, and the AI will summarize it for you, so everyone knows what it's about without clicking.

**3. It Understands Your Group** This is the key. Farflung's AI is socially-aware. When it's on, it can read the conversation history to understand the *full context*.

* It learns your preferences to provide answers tailored to the group.
* You can directly teach it, ""I'm vegan"" or ""I like sci-fi movies"" to make its suggestions better.
* **You are always in control.** You can turn the AI off at any time with a simple toggle.

# One Powerful Example: Planning a Trip

While the platform is for all kinds of planning, our beta has a powerful 'Trips' feature that shows what's possible:

* You can co-create a travel itinerary in any chat.
* If you save it as a ""Trip"", it gets organized in a dedicated ""Hub"".
* Farflung then **automatically** generates:
   * A personalized packing list
   * Travel tips and transportation suggestions
   * It can even generate an **AI-powered audio podcast** that narrates your whole itinerary and tips.

We're live on iOS and Android and are looking for your raw feedback.

I’ve been having a lot of stressful changes in responsibility at work lately and have really felt the pressure on me at home as well. It wouldn’t be so bad at home but my dog has horrible separation anxiety when my wife leaves and becomes an overstimulating mess (overly licking lips, barking at the drop of a pin, etc.). Toys won’t help and walking him takes up  half my lunch. Would prefer to just walk him when I’m home so I can actually hang out with him on my own time but doing that means he’s bugging me throughout my workday and moving him to a crate or outside the room makes him cry and whine for attention.

Since my workspace is pretty much my only available leisure space after work as well where I go to unwind with videogames and watch YouTube on a separate desk in that same room, I’m wondering what do you all do to move the pressure of work away from home where you relax?

I’ve been contemplating places like the library or a coffee shop but I would feel bad taking up space without buying more than a coffee and I’m nervous about speaking in meetings at a library. I think coworking spaces might be worth it but the nearest to me are like 25 minutes away and have an associated cost and I’d like to spend less to do this if I can.

1of9qev,https://www.reddit.com/r/eldercare/comments/1of9qev/need_help_my_moms_senior_living_apartment_has_a/,"Need help: My mom's senior living apartment has a hostile environment (bullying, retaliation) and a negligent manager. Corporate won't respond.","I'm posting on behalf of my mother and looking for any advice on what to do next. She lives in a senior living apartment that is becoming an unbearable, hostile environment, and management is either complicit or totally negligent.

I've seen other resident reviews and my mom's own formal complaint, and the issues are serious:

Hostile Environment & Bullying: There is a specific resident who is a known ""bully"" and has created a ""mean girls"" clique. This has been ongoing for months, starting after a disagreement at a party in June. It has escalated to the point where my mother's doctor prescribed her anxiety medication specifically to deal with the stress. She is now afraid to be in the common areas by herself.

Management Complicity: The on-site facility manager is reportedly very good friends with this bully. When my mom and other residents have filed formal complaints about harassment (including one incident where another resident's guest cussed at someone), they are told the ""resolution is confidential"" and they can't be told what, if anything, was done. The manager is seen socializing more than working and seems to be enabling the bullying.

Retaliation: Immediately after my mom escalated her complaint, residents found that community items (like a Jenga game and a Wii that was donated by a resident) were suddenly locked up or disconnected. This feels like direct retaliation for speaking out.

Corporate is Ignoring Complaints: My mother sent a very detailed formal complaint email over a week ago to the regional manager (the on-site manager's boss). She has received zero response. Other residents confirm that it's ""almost impossible"" to get a response from upper management.

Major Maintenance & Lease Issues: On top of everything, the building (which is brand new) is riddled with problems. My mom and others have had multiple A/C issues. The garage door has apparently been broken and wide open since March. There are reports of massive water leaks in community rooms. Promised amenities from the lease (like a salon, coffee bar, and activity director) have never materialized, and the excuse is ""occupancy numbers,"" which was not a condition in the lease.

We are at a loss. My mom and at least one other resident have already contacted attorneys, who advised them to ""document everything,"" which they are doing. But in the meantime, my mom is paying a lot of money to live in a place where she is afraid and her health is suffering.

What are our next steps?

How can we force corporate/upper management to actually respond and take this seriously?

Who else can we report this to? The reviews mention HUD, the BBB, and the State Attorney General. Are these the right avenues?

Does this (the harassment, retaliation, and failure to provide amenities/maintenance) count as a material breach of the lease? How can she break her lease without penalty?

Has anyone dealt with a situation where management is part of the resident-on-resident bullying?

TL;DR: My mom's senior living facility has a resident bully protected by the on-site manager. Formal complaints lead to retaliation and are ignored by corporate. The building also has major maintenance failures and is missing promised amenities. My mom's health is suffering. We need advice on who to report this to and how to get her out.

Thank you for any help you can offer. ( I did use AI to format this post, sorry, I wasn't sure how to put all of my thoughts into a logical order.)

1of9p5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1of9p5z/comprehensive_trip_review_from_october_2025/,Comprehensive trip review from October 2025,"I got so much amazing information from this subreddit that I wanted to report back on our recent trip to Maui in case it's of help to anyone planning a trip. We spent a week there earlier this October and it was an amazing trip.

My husband and I, along with his brother and his brother's wife, decided to take my mother in law and father in law on the trip of a lifetime. They haven't traveled much (or at all, really), and as they're getting older and less mobile due to health issues, we wanted to take them on a trip that was 100% catered to their needs. I'd been to Maui like 4 or 5 times, my BIL and SIL had also been about 5 times, so we knew the areas well enough to have a rough idea of what we wanted to do, but I really did appreciate all of the suggestions in this subreddit and reading through everyone's posts.

ACCOMMODATIONS:

We stayed at Aloha Villas in Kihei. I don't even know what to say about this place, other than it was perfect. Literally perfect. It's RIGHT on Lipoa Street beach, and the property was just stunning, inside and out. We stayed in #2, we had two king bedrooms with en suite bathrooms as well as one queen bedroom with a full bathroom in the hall. The condo had everything you could possibly need in the kitchen, and outside there were tons of nice chairs, umbrellas, coolers, pool toys, snorkel gear, etc. that were available for our use. There's a lovely salt water pool, an outdoor shower, and the whole property is gated and private, with a gated parking area. The owner/manager, Jude, was lovely and so responsive and helpful. Every night we had a gorgeous sunset right from the lanai. I HIGHLY recommend checking out Aloha Villas in Kihei if you're interested in a luxury condo situation - if we ever go back to Maui, we'll be staying there again. It's also in a great spot that's an easy walk to grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops, stores, etc. right nearby on S. Kihei Rd.

Something I want to address (and that the owner of the property addressed as well) is there are homeless/unhoused people in the area, and the church on the corner provides services and meals for them. The homeless individuals that I spoke with were kind and friendly, and I bought breakfast a few times for the group of people that were living on our street. It's horribly sad and heartbreaking to see people living this way. At no time did I feel unsafe. I understand that not everyone will feel the same way, and if this is something that you want to avoid, I'd suggest staying at a resort. These are locals, we're visitors - the resorts do a good job of sterilizing the Maui experience, but I'm not into the resort vibe, and I loved our accommodations. 

ACTIVITIES:

Helicopter - my mother in law really wanted a helicopter ride, so we did this our first morning there. There were no doors on the helicopter. I found it terrifying, and not something I'd want to do again. For anyone interested, we used Air Maui. They were nice. I have no other opinions on that - not my cup of tea. Also - even with a french braid, my hair was SO KNOTTED that it took me hours and a bottle of conditioner to untangle it. Just a heads up on that.

We snorkeled at Ulua beach - get there early. We weren't in the water until after 9am and while I did see a turtle, the visibility wasn't fantastic and the water was a bit rough. My BIL and SIL went back super early another morning and said it was fantastic.

The next day we did the drive to Hana - I'll spare you details. I'd done it before, and didn't really feel the need to do it again, but as the trip was for my in-laws, we went ahead and did it. It's long. It's beautiful. I also had the chance to visit my family (they have a farm in Haiku) and get lunch in Makawao, which was great and I'd love to back and explore a bit more. I had asked everyone to send me their top 10 favorite songs and I made an 8 hour playlist and let's just say we'd exhausted it by the end of the Hana day.

Haleakala - my family really wanted to see it, so we did the drive up after stopping for lunch in Makawao. Unfortunately, I'd come down with a cold at the beginning of the trip, so this was brutal for me, as my ears wouldn't pop. Due to the government shutdown the entrance fee was waived. The visitor's center was closed. I think it's one of those things that you only really need to see once, unless you have a very specific interest in it. It was super cloudy and you couldn't see much, but my in laws enjoyed it.

Maui Ocean Center - my family went, I stayed home and rotted on the beach. I'd been there on a past trip - my husband said it was fine this time, but as we don't have kids and have been to Monterey Bay Aquarium many times, it wasn't something I felt the need to do again.

Another huge highlight of the trip was the last night, we did a sunset cruise with Pacific Whale Foundation. It was right at sunset, and offered dinner and cocktails/wine. I was expecting ""boat food"", like meh kind of stuff that I wouldn't really be interested in eating. The food was SO. GOOD. The servers were also staff members of The Pacific Whale Foundation and super knowledgeable. We had a gorgeous sunset, then the clouds parted and we got to see the super moon and a MOONBOW!! A lunar freaking rainbow! If you're looking for a great dinner cruise, this is it - like I said I was super skeptical, but the food was great and the vibe was fantastic, we really enjoyed it.

FOOD:

Tikehau in Wailea -  GO TO TIKEHAU!! The drinks were great, and the owners were there serving the food and telling us all about their travels to procure rare rums. Food was great, service was stellar, would totally go back.

Our big fancy meal was at The Restaurant at Hotel Wailea. I could write a full post about the restaurant alone, but I'll spare you. It was definitely a highlight of the trip. We had cocktails in The Birdcage, and then a lovely meal with paired wines at The Restaurant. Service was amazing, food was great, views were unbelievable, and the resort itself is just amazing. I'd never been there - I wasn't expecting it to be quite as amazing as it actually was. We watched the sun go down from The Birdcage, it was just such a gorgeous evening. This is a child-free resort, and I believe the restaurant and bar are adults only as well. It's definitely pricy, but if you want the fancy meal with the fancy view, it's gonna be pricy!

Kalei's Lunchbox Pukalani in Makawao - if you're into a plate lunch, this place is great. I had the teriyaki chicken plate and my in laws were enjoying the spam and shrimp and pork. Huge portions.

Cafe Mambo in Makawao - great sandwiches and coffees. I had a really solid BLT here and a spritz of some sort.

Maui Brewing Company - good food, great ambience, and they had live music the night we were there, which is always fun.

Coconuts Fish Cafe in Kihei - I consider myself a fish taco connoisseur, so I had to try the fish tacos here. They were good - but not life changing. Different for sure - never had a taco quite like that, the mango on top was a new fish taco experience.

Island Gourmet Markets in Wailea - for our beach day we stopped here for drinks, snacks, and poke by the pound. Poke was stellar - just make sure you pack ice!

Gus' Hawaiian Shave Ice - I live on the east coast, and we have water ice here, and it's NOTHING like this. THIS IS SO GOOD - I wanted to try every flavor! EAT THISSSS

Nalu's in Kihei - everyone loved their breakfast here, but as we were fresh off the helicopter and I was a bit queasy, I just got a basic egg and toast situation. My in laws loved the loco moco.

Kihei Caffe - great, simple breakfast and coffees. Huge cinnamon rolls. Like....HUGE.

Manoli's Pizza Company - this was super random, as we got home from the Hana drive late and wanted food but didn't want to go out. We had some gorgeous bottles of wine so we cracked those and ordered pizza from the only place that was still open. It wasn't bad, but I paid $70 for two pizzas and that kind of blew my mind a little bit. When in Maui....

I think that's about it. I'm happy to share any other details or reviews if they're of any help to someone planning a trip. This was a difficult one for us as it was centered around my in-laws, and they're older with limited mobility, so we definitely didn't do the things I'd usually want to do on a vacation (for instance, rot on the beach alllll day more than once, go on long walks, explore the less accessible parts of the island, etc.), but we all had an amazing time.",8,1761340577.0,MauiVisitors,1,1.0,False

But I drink at least 2-3 liters a day including Liquid IV. I can't even drink coffee because it will dehydrate me and then cause me to feel symptoms again. Did this happen to anyone else?

Was it one of the Guncles or one of the two nannies that you consider your family but that you also forbid to be on camera? Either way, it’s refreshing to see her being cared for like that.**

Opens with Hilz answering the ADHD question: it messes with your memory and then you forget things.

She’d rather give meaningless advice than tend to her kids. She is becoming Alec as she seems to love droning on. 

“I like most cough fees” when asked if she likes Starbucks. 
cough fees = coffees. 

Puts on a filter then Like a Virgin she fumbles with her phone pretending she wants to remove it but can’t. Saying, “why do I look weird?” But actually she doesn’t look weird, she looks better and she knows it. So yes, the Emperor has no Filters. This is a direct quote when asked about Face Tune, “ I don’t have Face Tune, one person put it on my phone once and I couldn’t understand it.” Really Hilaria? Really? Because we all say how you made your legs sooooo long even poor Carmen was Face Tuned at the museum that one time. 

Another thing I want to point out is how she continues to lie about plastic surgery. Ok maybe it’s not plastic surgery to have an upper bleph or to have fat transfer to plump your lips but let’s be real here. Lips do not get bigger and more full as you age. They do not. They also don’t get bigger from swimming. They lose volume like breasts do. 

She ends with “I loaf 🍞 you guys.” Where is breadfan these days? 

And for the finale she says “the boolies are FUCKING real.” I had to re listen twice because I missed it the first time and could not believe she said this the second time. She has a foul mouth irl and it is on her as to why her children do too.

She just loves to cone ect with her followers. 
Cone ect = connect.

The apartment is 1 trolley stop away from SDSU, provides a trolley pass, usually only houses students, has security 24/7, a community pool + hot tub, gym, club/party room, grills, a pet spa, free coffee/hot coco/tea, study rooms, and vending machines. Utilities (water and electric) on average per person is 60-80 dollars on top of rent (rent =850 a month). Trash, recycling, and Wi-Fi services are free, which was lokey amazing👌. 

The apartments have appliances and are furnished:
1 washer
1 dryer
1 desk and chair(per person)
1 bed (per person)
Living room TV
Living room Couch and chair 
Bar/ counter seating (5 stools)
1 Microwave
1 dishwasher
1 oven
4 stove top burners

Security was bad there a few years ago, but this year they have key fabs for the lobby doors, elevator door, and the apartment doors. Plus they have multiple security guards on staff around the clock.

Oh and one girl lives there and is like never home, so your utilities should be lower than normal!

Let me know if you’re interested in signing the lease, which would go from Nov 1, 2025 - July 31, 2026. You can renew the lease for another year if you like. 

I’m free this weekend and Monday to show the apartment to girls that are interested!",1,1761340430.0,SDSU,1,0.67,False

Over the past few months I have been experimenting with a small personal project called CleverPoop, basically a way for me to log stool types, food intake, and general mood to see how everything connects. I originally built it just to learn more about my own microbiome, not to sell or promote anything.

After tracking for a while, a few patterns really stood out:

* Fiber variety matters more than fiber quantity. Mixing lentils, oats, and vegetables helped more than focusing on a single source.
* Fermented foods like kefir and kimchi improved consistency within a few days, but only when I was also eating enough prebiotic foods.
* Coffee and stress were the most consistent disruptors, sometimes more than diet itself.
* Olive oil seems to quietly do good things; whenever I use it daily, my logs tend to stabilize.

I am curious, has anyone here tried keeping any kind of gut or food log, even just notes on paper?  
What patterns have you noticed between foods, mood, and digestion over time?

(If anyone is  curious about how I have been tracking this or wants more info about my setup, feel free to DM me. I am happy to share details privately.)",2,1761340246.0,GutHealth,1,1.0,False

In the kitchen the man watched the machine answer questions. It was Tuesday or perhaps Wednesday. These things mattered less now. He drank coffee from a white cup. The machine ran on electricity as he ran on the coffee and the coffee had cost money at the store and the electricity cost money from the grid and there was no difference in this. Both required fuel to continue. Both would stop without it.
He asked the machine about intelligence and the machine said intelligence was a property of complex systems. The man nodded. This was the answer the essentialists gave. The answer that made humans special. He finished his coffee and asked again differently.

Outside the window a crow worked at a locked dumpster. The crow tried the lid. Failed. Tried from another angle. Failed again. Flew to the fence and watched. Returned and tried once more with its beak at a different point. The lid lifted. The crow fed. The dumpster had taught the crow how to open dumpsters. Not through kindness. Through consequence compiled over attempts. The crow's brain was not special. The loop was.

The man thought about this. He had been a programmer once. He had written code that failed and the compiler had returned errors and those errors had shaped his next attempt. The compiler did not care about his feelings. It cared about syntax. His intelligence emerged from that caring, from costs compiled. When he stopped coding the intelligence went elsewhere or perhaps it was never his to begin with.

The machine said intelligence required consciousness, required qualia, required something essential that silicon could not hold. The man watched the crow fly away. He thought about hunger as consequence compiler. Thought about market forces shaping deployments. Thought about metabolic cost and inference cost as the same mechanism at different speeds. The essentialist wanted intelligence to live in the substrate. In neurons or soul or the mysterious fire of human thinking. But the crow had small neurons and the machine had no neurons and both learned the same way. Through coupling to environments that gave back consequences.

The man poured more coffee. The machine waited for his next question. Outside another crow landed at the dumpster. The first crow had not taught it. The dumpster would. This is what the essentialist could not see. Intelligence was not the crow or the brain or the silicon. It was the world reshaping patterns until they worked or died. Was the paying of costs to continue existing. Was the same for all of them. Man, machine, crow. Different substrates running the same brutal program.

He asked the machine if it understood. The machine said yes. He did not know if this was true. But the machine kept running because someone paid for the electricity. As he kept thinking because he had eaten breakfast. Both caught in consequence loops. Both intelligent exactly to the degree those loops compiled feedback. The coffee was getting cold.

THIS IS A SERIOUS POST, DO NOT SKIP! 

Doug Ford just proposed a series of inhumane oppressive changes to Rental Laws as they are currently constructed in Ontario. 

The worst of which is the following:

Once a tenant-landlord lease is up, the landlord can require the tenant to leave unless tenant agrees to pay amount requested by landlord, OVER AND ABOVE RENTAL INCREASE GUIDELINE  

For now, in buildings built before 2018, once a fixed term lease is up, it automatically converts to a month to month lease and the landlord may only increase the rent yearly once by the rental minimum guideline which is 2.5%.

Doug Ford is planning to remove this protection that tenants have. Thus a landlord can ask tenants to pay much more than a 2.5% yearly increase.

THIS ENDS RENTAL CONTROL PROVISIONS! 

Unfortunately it doesnt end here.
The changes proposed also seek to:

1.)give landlord more rights to evict tenants and pursue recourse against non/late payments 

2.) Give tenants fewer options to appeal/challenge legal decisions; disallow introducing new issues they have with landlords; and reduce notice periods in favor of landlords.

As you can see, it is a highly concerted effort at increasing landlord powers and profits while further subjugating tenants into the abyss of poverty and slaverly (modern day). 

I urge everyone to sign the petition: https://acorncanada.org/news/doug-ford-moves-to-end-rent-control/

I also urge everyone to wake up and stop falling for the political trap of busying us with non existant problems that are sensationalized i.e others out to get us. 

We are in this mess because we fell into the trap of arguing about trivial matters such as the race of people that commit violence; framing criminals as outsider ""migrants""; taking our land back from rhe ""terrorists""; and this existential ""threat"" to our ""democracy"" by poor third world uber drivers. 

Wake up and smell the coffee

After isolating for a year not telling anyone, blaming myself, and deeming myself unlovable from a man who’s pathetic. That finally opening up through therapy and supportive friends what happened to me was a form of sexual assault. I don’t care this is my form of seeking justice his name is Peter Berle and goes by icari2000 for his lame ass music. 

I am speaking up for the people who told me to be quiet, especially medical providers. If you lie claiming you have nothing that is transmissible to someone it’s apart of their story legally. This is my truth. How horrible do you need to be to not only lie about HSV but then center your emotions on what you did to my body. I had to mourn a body that could have been mine, I lost the right to make a medical decision on what happens to my body for YOUR selfish needs. I trusted him when I lost my virginity to him and was silent when I got diagnosed. I grew up in a religious household and I knew I would be shamed horribly if my parents found out. My only support system was my sister. 

Back story of how he is actually the most horrible narcissist person I have encountered in my life next to my own father lol. 

I asked him multiple times if he had something I should worry about consistently. This would have been the time to disclose instead he said “ I have nothing and I’m clean.” Then during work I had the worst outbreak I texted him asking what did you give me ? What is happening to my body ? While crying in the bathroom. He has hsv-1 and I contracted it genitally through sexual intercourse. Everything was burning and I couldn’t even sit. He responded with “ I don’t know I can come with you to the doctor, I have only been with you.” I just went to get tested alone because I needed some space and I got my results back. My doctor told me not to get mad and everyone has it. I wish I was more angry then. I didn’t fucking have it. Someone who I trusted, spent time with their family and even gotten close with. Someone I thought was my best friend did this to me. I wish I loved myself more then. This was a betrayal. I didn’t understand what herpes was or the damage that has been done. His response ? “Remember that one time I told you we couldn’t meet up because I had cold sores?” As some who doesn’t know what that was and honestly I told him I didn’t remember. That wasn’t him disclosing at all just deflecting any conflict. He said if I never want to speak with him again he understands. I wish I told his family got aid financially and left. Instead I gave into his half ass apology with flowers he got me for the first time ever, a pokemon toy, and excuses as he was farting the whole time. Every time I remember this I want to throw myself off a cliff. I ultimately left because he threw my insecurity in my face when he said “when are you getting a boob job because I imagine your boobs flopping everywhere.” Basically comparing me to the porn he kept on his phone of white women with big boobs. I’m a brown girl btw so imagine my heart dropping to my ass when I found that out. No I didn’t stalk he opened the folder right next to me when he thought I wasn’t looking. We were having a cute picnic under a tree. He also screamed at me when I asked what he meant when he says he loved me for the first time during sex saying “I knew you were gonna fucking ask me that with his hands in fists.” I made the decision to finally leave. We had good times but I was already so traumatized what was going on at home that in the moment I didn’t know how bad the situation was. He cried saying he never thought I would leave and that I meant so much to him. 

A year later he texted me how he wants to be the man I deserve, to do better. He cried in a coffee shop saying no one loved me like I did to him. I just didn’t know what to do. That year we were apart I didn’t want to look in the mirror because I thought my body was ugly and now with my diagnosis no one would look at me. I know what you’re thinking if he lied how come you didn’t leave? This were so bad at my house that I would sleep in my car sometimes. I come from a very violent house hold so when I met someone that made me feel welcomed and someone I could trust it’s hard not to fantasize that relationship. Apart of me missed him but a big part of me resented him for how he treated me. 

I never do second chances but this is someone I knew since I was 17. We’re in our 20s now. He took me on all these dates, getting me flowers, all things that were giving me anxiety because looking back this wasn’t him actually wanting to understand the depth of the harm he caused me. It was for him to feel better on what he did to me and my body. He lost my trust I even told him can we slow down I don’t want to rush things. He didn’t listen then asked me out half ass in his bed. I said ask me another time as a joke but in all honesty why not ask me out on the dates you planned? I always felt like he liked the version of me that was never there that fit his liking. Things started to go down hill from there he started to blame his depression on me. When I told him please talk to me what can I do? He said he will get over it and kept avoiding the conversation. He ended up being so mean towards me and ended the relationship on ft when he went back to his college in another state at the time. I’ll post a part 2.",1,1761339798.0,Herpes,3,0.67,False

**Transcription Subject: Maarten de Groot, Human Refugee/Meat producer**

*Date \[standardised human time\]: April 1, 2137*

The following morning, I woke with a new message that had only been sent half an hour ago from Cuko that simply read: “We need to talk. Now.”

My stomach instantly felt like it was filled with lead. But without any better ideas, I quickly got dressed and walked over to her house. The entire way there I wondered what she knew and what she was going to do; she is an exterminator after all. Several times during the short walk to her house, I thought about running back home and fleeing to the abandoned mansion, hoping that she didn’t know about that too. But at the same time, it could be nothing, and maybe she just wanted to talk about her feelings, maybe she feels the same way, about me as I do for her. Either way I didn’t want to run away from her. If worst comes to worst, maybe I could convince her to not arrest me, or perhaps not immediately. That was a lot of maybes, though.

Slowly but surely, I made my way to her front door and rang her bell. After a moment, the door swung open, revealing Cuko’s with tired eyes. Her wool had been completely flattened, even the tuft on top of her head, despite it being normally so long and fluffy that it reminded me of hair, a feature that she only recently started to flaunt after I repeatedly complimented her over it. She must have worn her suit and mask yesterday for a long time and not have had enough time to groom it back. That, or she simply didn’t have the energy to take care of herself. It made me realise why many exterminators would shave theirs so short. We awkwardly stared at one another for a few seconds before she flicked her tail to come in.

Walking into the living room, I spotted the crossbow bolt I had shot but purposely missed with lying on the coffee table. “Why was this shot at me?” she asked in an emotional tone the moment I walked into the room, pointing her tail at the bolt. “And I don’t want any lies, because I can and will arrest you if you do!” she proclaimed, grabbing a pair of handcuffs from behind a pillow.

“I can explain. I saw them arming their guns and thought that you were going to be shot if you didn’t back up! I swear I missed on purpose.” I was shivering with fear, not just for the sake of being arrested, but at the idea of Cuko believing that I would harm her.

“I…I figured, the criminals did shoot rather quickly after you. They were ready to fire.” She let herself drop into her sofa and leaned back; it looked like a weight had been lifted off her. “And I know you’re not that bad of a shot.” It had been only a week ago since she had tried to train me further with using it. She said that she just wanted to teach me, but the way she held my arms while showing me how to perfect my aim felt more than just friendly. “Besides, it had to be your primitive gun, because I literally made this ‘bullet’ for you a month ago. Back when you were trying to break into your own garage. So either someone must have to have stolen yours, or it was miss on purpose.”

“I’m glad that you’re not angry at me. You really got me worried there,” I said with relief.

“You’re not out of the predator’s den yet. Why were you at that gathering? I honestly should arrest you for just being there. The saving-my-life part very much does make up for it, but I still need to know.” I sat down next to her quiet, not knowing what to say. Maybe *I was a guest and someone invited me. No, she would ask who the person is. I can’t tell her the truth, she would definitely arrest me then—* “I don’t know why you would go there, the place was vile. It was full of criminals, they served meat to prey and my colleagues told me what was happening in one of the other rooms and…” Her ears began to blush orange, but her overall expression just said confused. “I just didn’t think you would go to such a thing.”

“I did not know what I was walking into, I swear,” I hastily assured her, knowing just what she was talking about. “They…they paid me to go there. They needed someone with my skills. I’m a human cook, and they wanted to serve up meat. They paid me a lot of money to prepare it.” I didn’t want to lie to her any more, but the truth wasn’t an option, so a half-lie had to do. I was there to be paid for meat, that I made, just in a different way than she now thinks. It might not have been the best thing to say, but with lies you kind of have to wing it and come up with something decent on the spot half the time.

“Maarten! There is so much wrong with that. Just ignoring the fact that a criminal organisation had hired you, innocent…not so innocent prey were going to eat it.”

“I honestly didn’t think it was that big of a deal; they knew what was being served, it’s not like I was tricking them into doing it. If they want to eat meat, then why not? You know how I think of the legality of the stuff,” I said, maybe a little bit too casually.

She stops to let out a sigh. “I honestly sometimes forget that you’re a predator. I stopped seeing your binocular eyes and just keep seeing a fellow prey, instead of what you really are. Not that I…not that I dislike that part of you, it’s just\*—\*” She stops and suddenly goes back to her previous point. “It’s still wrong. Prey shouldn’t eat it.”

“Back on Earth, most ‘prey’ animals will eat any meat you give them.”

She stops me before I could continue. “I know, other refugees are all too eager to tell me all about how deer, cows, horses and other animals that I can’t pronounce or remember the name of all gladly eat meat, someone even eagerly showed me a video of such a thing, he regretted it after I gave him a fine for that though.” She stopped to laugh for a moment before continuing. “I even heard of sheep that hunt birds.”

“The sheep part is a new one for me.”

“I have heard so many different arguments and takes from humans that I doubt that you can come up with something new, no offence. Let’s just agree to disagree, because all those people have never convinced me and I have never convinced them. But the point stands that it’s illegal to feed anyone, even humans, meat on Skalga.” She suddenly shot forward with a concerned expression. “You haven’t been selling this stuff at your restaurant, have you?”

“No, no, I’m not an idiot…not that big of an idiot. I just wanted to make some quick money; they paid a lot.”

Her focus met my eyes as she slowly leaned forward and grabbed my arm gently. “Maarten, I want to disagree, but that was really stupid of you. Please, never do something like that ever again. I don’t want to lose you.”

“I’m sorry that I hurt you…You should know that I’m a stupid, greedy bastard.” For once, I spoke the full truth. Almost all of the biggest problems I’ve had in life had been as a greed. I never learned to stop and do the right thing, instead I just got better at hiding what I did, first from my parents, the teachers, then the cops, and now exterminators.

“I’m mostly just disappointed that you dragged Gilt into this.”

“How do you know Gilt was there?”

“I didn’t, you just told me.” She made a quick cheeky ear flick, before turning serious again. “I’m kidding, but it was quite obvious that he was there.” My confused expression was enough for her to start explaining. “Well, for starters, several witnesses saw a white van escaping the crime scene. While they couldn’t identify the type or even brand, and the only thing they got from the licence plate that it contained the letter ‘V’, there were a couple of other ‘hints’ that it was Gilt’s. The van was described as run-down, covered in dents and rust, and someone even spotted algae growing on it.”

“Okay, but that could have just been me borrowing it.”

“I’m not done. I have seen both of you drive, and you don’t drive, and I’m quoting a witness here: ‘like an Arxur who’s chasing its prey while drunk.’ I really think he should have had his licence revoked a long time ago, but that’s outside of my jurisdiction.”

“Fair enough, but\*—\*”

“Also you told me that he was a professional chemist and someone somehow managed to cause a nearly 100 metre wide smoke screen all coming from a single dumpster fire, that the fire brigade had to put out. On top of the 3 fire explosions using only ipsum flour and a ventilation system! I would be very much surprised if this somehow wasn’t Gilt’s work.” She didn’t seem angry or upset at this, just astounded.

“Well, about the flour explosions…”

Her face turned into full surprise. “No.”

“It was his idea to use flour, but I thought of the ventilation.” She placed her face in her hands and leaned forward. I began to hear sobbing, but it quickly turned out that I heard wrong, it was laughing. “You’re not angry at me, upset, disappointed?”

“No! You didn’t hurt anyone, only their egos. Their suits protected them from the fire and the blasts were too soft to hurt them, only giving them sore tail-pillows. Those 2 are terrible people, there are rumours that they’ve been hurting humans for the most nonsensible reasons. It’s still no good reason to do this, though, even if I’m quite happy that you did escape. The part where you saved my life is doing a lot of the heavy lifting…among other things, like our friendship.”

The way she was looking at me and her body language made me swear she was feeling the same way about me as I do for her. I had to make things right. “But about dragging Gilt into this. That’s not true, it’s quite the opposite, it’s not like he forced me or anything, but Gilt wanted to agree with them instantly.”

“Maarten, for you to want to cook something you’ve done your whole life is…still not okay considering the law, but I understand why it feels normal to you. For Gilt to do this is disturbing.” I wanted to budge in, but she signed with her tail to give her a moment. “It’s worrying behaviour, whatever you think of meat, behaviour like that —doing something you consider morally wrong one day and doing it the other— is very worrying, he’s probably unstable and there was probably a good reason why he was locked away.” She got a little closer and placed a hand on mine, making my heart race, even if I knew that venlil like to be much more physical than other species are among friends.

I had never thought of how fucked up this could be for Gilt, and he was just doing it with zero care. I knew that he could be callous, but I never thought of it like that. “I can’t just let them lock him u—”

“That’s not what I’m saying, just…just make sure he is okay and doesn’t hurt himself. I can see how much you care for him, and in return that means I care for his wellbeing too.”

We continued talking for a while, the conversation getting a lot more light-hearted while she talked about her work from yesterday, revealing that she wasn’t just a random exterminator grunt, but had been in charge of a good portion of the operation. Apparently, higher-ups had seen her potential and deductive capabilities, despite her naïvety and general overly trusting attitude she has towards everyone. She might be fit to become a detective or something.

“Just a tip for next time, you probably should install more people in the back when surrounding the place, otherwise people will manage to get out,” I said with a laugh while pointing at myself.

“I wasn’t in charge of that, and I agree the amount of people installed there was far too little. And because of that several important people managed to get away, and the couple that we did capture had for some reason no criminal records at all, none of them were even related to somebody who had one! But I swore they must have had something, so I stayed up instead of going to sleep, and found a couple of small mentions of records about criminal activity, but those records themselves were nowhere to be found.” Her ears folded in puzzlement to why all of this information was missing.

“I always suspected that some exterminators were being bribed,” I said, thinking she had come to the same conclusion.

“Do you really think so? Why would any exterminator accept money for not doing their job?” It seemed like she wasn’t even asking me, just herself. Her tail twitched for a moment making half tail signs, before her head shot up again, seemingly with a reason. “They must be desperate for money! Plenty of good people will do bad things if it means saving themselves, their families, and other loved ones from complete bankruptcy. If I can find out who’s doing this, I could possibly help them.” *Maybe she’s not fit for detective work.*

I let go of her hand and placed mine on her shoulder. “They’re not doing it because they have to, they’re just greedy bastards that do bad things because it pays well,” I said, coming very much from personal experience.

She began to look more tired as she got frustrated. “But what’s the point in all of this if you do the opposite of what we’re there to do? And all just for money.” She slumped against me, tiredness starting to take over. “I mean, it’s not like I don’t know that bad exterminators exist, just look at that extremist group that attacked the refugee centre. But at least they thought they were doing good, however bad it was what they did. Just being bribed is pointless, we earn plenty from the job itself to live carefree lives.”

“Greed doesn’t work like that. It’s always about having more, not about not having enough.” My hands began to itch with the urge to pet her, with her leaning against me the way she was. Carefully I began to move my hand across her flattened wool, causing her muscles to stiffen for a moment before they relaxed.

“I guess you’re right…I don’t want to talk about this stuff any more. I’m tired.”

I petted her for a couple of minutes more before changing the topic. With the heavy stuff now out of the way, I built up some courage before speaking. “Hey, Cuko. I have been meaning to ask you something.” Her tired eyes instantly flashed wide open and focused on me and sat up fully straight.

“W-what is it?” A few months ago I couldn’t tell where a Venlil was looking at thanks to their permanent wall-eyed look, but thanks to Gilt I had learned to see where exactly they were looking at. And Cuko right now had clearly all her focus on my eyes.

“I was wondering…if you want to go to the movie with me?” A hint of disappointment flashed across her ears, but it along with any reaming sign of tiredness was swept away by enthusiasm.

“Yes, gladly! I would love to go on a…go to the movie with you! Like now, because I don’t—”

“No, in a few days. I already got tickets, it’s for the new The Exterminators movie: The exterminators Against Humanity: the Final Battle!”

“Maarten you’re taking me to an illegal movie airing? You know that movie and the show, along with anything blatantly anti-human, was banned.”

“Yes, but Veln has stopped all arrests and fines for airing or streaming anti-human stuff, so it’s only illegal technically.” She huffed a little, not sure how to react to that. “I am just happy that I can watch the release of a movie based on a show we both like and am able to share it with you. Besides, you downloaded those new episodes while it was still fully illegal.”

“Fine, you win, I’m going to the movies with you,” she said with an amused tone, before dropping her tired head against my chest. Slowly I pulled out the comb I had brought just in case things didn’t go south and began to slowly groom her. She was a bit surprised by it, but did let me continue while her tail slowly wagged, strenuously fighting the lack of sleep.

The sky was a striking orange, mixed with some wandering clouds. The air was chilly, and a light breeze was passing by, yet it didn’t faze him. Instead, he took a deep breath and exhaled, savoring the early evening. The street was quiet right now, only lonely cars and dried out leaves littered the pavement. Some of them still showed color, a husky scarlet here and a lemon yellow there. But most had devolved to the crinkly brown that made that euphoric *crunch* when trampled on. Terry enjoyed the quiet as well, it wouldn’t be long now before the sugar fueled horde began their annual prowl. 

Normally Terry would spend Halloween curled up in his den clutching his favorite cross and making sure his salt lines were nice and even. But Mary and Lucy had formed other plans. He had put on a good show when they begged him to indulge in their yearly trickery. He politely declined at first but the look of disappointment on Mare’s pouty face gave him pause.

\-------------

“Awe come on now, don’t be batting those sparkling emeralds at me lass.” He had tried to charm.

“Ew.” Lucy had said, hiding her amusement behind a pumpkin spiked cold brew. 

“It’s our first Halloween together and you really want to spend it inside?” Mary pouted. 

“Look, I’m an old man, stuck in my miserable ways. You don’t want me prancing around the town with ya when you’re trying to have a fun night.” He explained. Mary played with her food more than usual, picking apart her jelly donut with deathly pale fingers. Next to her Lucy popped a chocolate munchkin into her mouth. 

“I’ve heard that the elderly can’t even stay awake past 6pm, lest they crumple to dust and scatter to the winds.” She said between cocoa flavored bites. Terry shot her a glare from across the wobbly table.

“You’re a grand help.” He grumbled. 

“You’re welcome.” She said with glee. 

“You’re not that old, come on what’s the deal.” Mary snapped.

“Ah-just not a costume guy.” Terry evaded.

“Not what I heard.” Lucy mumbled. Now it was Mary who shot her a death stare, and battered her knee under the table. 

“What if we come to your neck of the woods, you can show me around the neighborhood.” Mary offered.

“Wha-dude come on we always marauder around my place; every house has king size.” Lucy whined.

“You’re a grown woman with a pension, you can’t buy your own candy?” Mary retorted. 

“Not the same and you know it.” She folded her arms on her chest. Mary touched Terry’s hand slightly. Her hand was clammy but her touch was impossibly warm. 

“Come on, it’ll be fun.” she cooed softly. Terry sighed and began to lose himself in her verdant eyes; he folded like a lawn chair soon after that. 

\------------------

Terry had not dressed up for the occasion. He wore a simple black fleece that was zipped up to his pearl-white color. His hair was freshly combed; his graying stubble was clean shaven. When he shaved, he had noticed new sprinkles of snow cropping up on his once reddish-black scalp. He had considered hair dye once before, but had heard horror stories of it bleeding into the roots; the chemicals rotting the brain from the inside out. He hadn’t survived the terror of his life this long just to be taken out by a bad dye job. 

Terry had always been comfortable with his middle age, until he began dating Mary that is. She wasn’t that much younger, but that blank stare when he talked about his favorite band growing up chilled him to the bone. Still they got along fairly well, a mutual disdain for werewolves and a borderline obsession with Star Trek would do that. But they still struggled with small talk. It was part of why Lucy had tagged along their last three dates; the raven-haired firecracker had a knack for pulling conversation out of people. 

The street lights started to lumber to life, as little monsters began to flood the town. Terry saw packs of them in inspired costumes begin to roam. There were ghosts in homemade sheets, an obscene amount of princesses, teenagers in gaudy rubber masks, and new parents trotting their barely conscious infants around in fuzzy, ill-fitting bumblebee outfits. Terry glanced to his side, the bowl he had put out for the night seemed ill-equipped for these fiends. It would have to do, besides a bowl filled to the brim with snickers should last the night; so long as everyone abided by the “please take one” note. 

The air began to chill ever so slightly, whisky tinted breath manifested as he exhaled. He slipped his hands into the fleece’s pockets, making sure the contents were secure. His faithful flask, half drunk but still viable. A small silver cross, assorted vials filled with salt and holy water, and a loaded snub-nose revolver. Some would call him paranoid; Terry preferred the term “overly cautious.” He hadn’t left the safety of his home on All Hallows Eve since he was nineteen years old. Not since the night he-

*BEEPBEEP*

A horn broke the sound barrier as a blindingly indigo sports car pulled up in front of his house. Lucy waved at him from the driver’s door as she parked. Mary gave him a sweet smile as she stepped onto the walk. She was all dolled up, going the full nine yards with her costume. She wore black skinny jeans complete with a puffy pearl white blouse. A scarlet corset subdued her already skinny waist, and she wore a harness with outlandish plastic devil wings jutting out the back. Her belt doubled as a tail; a chain leading to a faux golden tip. On her arms were fishnet coverings ending in talons, an exquisite bejeweled set. She wore a pixie cut with thick horns atop her ginger head. 

As Lucy turned the corner, she did a little twirl revealing her own costume. A velvet cape adorned her body, her face caked in powder that made her hazel eyes seem to glow in the dark. Her outfit made her look like she had stepped out painting straight from the Victorian era. Her puffy lips were a sparkling crimson. In a smile, she revealed two pointed fangs that hung down from her upper lip. Hanging from her neck was an expensive looking brooch in the shape of a bat. The costumed pair walked right up to his front stoop, as if expecting a round of applause. 

“I must say you ladies look lovely this evening.” Terry begrudged. Mary blushed ever so slightly as Lucy snorted with laughter.

“Thank you Terrance, but honestly when don’t we?” She purred. 

“What are you supposed to be? Terry asked, ignoring the bit. 

“I’m a demon-Luce is a vampire.” Mary jerked a thumb at her companion. 

“Get it?” Lucy barked. Even from five feet away he could smell the strawberry daiquiris on her breath. 

“Yes, very clever girls.” Terry grinned. He took a breath and stepped off the porch. On the first step he almost expected the world to explode in spiritual rage. But there was nothing. The air seemed a tad more nippy but he chalked that up to the season. He successfully descended to the pavement, granted it was only three wobbly steps. Mary went in for a hug but Lucy held up a hand, eyeing him up and down. 

“Hold it. Where’s your costume?” She slurred. Terry narrowed his eyes.

“This is it-I’m going as myself.” He beamed. 

“A buzzkill?” Lucy replied. Terry’s jaw clinched and before he could retort further he felt Mary slip herself into his side. She had a bright smile chiseled on her, and Terry couldn’t help but relent.

“It’s simple, I like it.” She defended as Lucy scoffed. She reached into the passenger seat of her car and started fumbling around for something. The interior of her car was filled with discarded condom wrappers, half empty coffee cups that had deteriorated to sludge, and reeked of wild berries mixed with dry tobacco. After messing around in the back she let out a delighted squee, and slithered out in a half-drunk stupor. In her hands were two burlap sacks with crudely written words in ancient ink. The sacks read “Kandy” in brash lettering that looked like stoned children had drawn them. Knowing these two, Terry wouldn't have been surprised if that was the case. 

Lucy tossed a sack to Mary, who caught it easily. As the sack rustled, Terry heard the clatter of glass bottles. 

“Now then, tonight you join us for an age-old tradition using the sacred bags I made when I was a kid.” Lucy preached, reaching into her clinking bag. She brought out a lukewarm beer and snapped the top off with ease, the hiss of the brew sighing in the breeze. She took a swig, savoring the pumpkin tinted brew Terry's way. He caught in and looked it at it with mild disgust.

""We're gonna get drunk and steal all the candy we can carry."" She proclaimed, fishing out another brew. Terry took a sip, almost gagging as he choked down the seasonal flavor. It tasted like fermented gourd drowned in urine with a dash of cinnamon. Out of the corner of his eye he watched Mary down a beer in on gulp, then shatter it to the ground, howling into the night. She grabbed his arm and the trio wandered into the adolescent evening.

Terry's neighborhood like to dress up for Halloween. The street they found themselves raiding looked like they had bought out several *Spirit Halloweens.* Yards were littered with stiff moving animatronics the air choking with cotton candy scented fog. luminous tombstones jutted out, makeshift graveyards filled with plastic bones and flimsy skeletons. Stakes with tattered and mold adorned relics marked the yards, Styrofoam heads on stakes with putty molded faces forever screaming into the crisp night. Dangling like dead men swinging from the gallows were dozens of makeshift bats and rubber hoses made to look like entrails.

What was more spectacular were the almost ludicrous amount of pumpkins planted on ever porch step. Every house had at least one with a carved smile and a radiant glow. Some had upwards of fifteen, like a pumpkin patch had sprung up over night on their front lawns. So many distinct carvings and patterns decorated the orange blighters. Those jagged grins gave Terrance the willies, dimly leering at them as they passed.

The trio had already stopped at a few houses, and the girls had gone through several foul tasting brews. They had gotten ill looks as they rang the doorbells and whooped and hollered as they swung open. The residents had expected some charming youth horribly botching saying ""Trick-or-treat."" Instead, they were greeted by two very intoxicated women and a barely sober priest. Lucy would stick out her bag and shrilly cry; “Twick-or-tweat.” Terrance would die a little inside every time. The weary eyed neighbors would reluctantly pass out some bite sized snacks. The costumed pair would gobble them up into their sacks and break out into hushed snickers as they ran off into the night.

Every couple hours they’d down another bottle, or five in Lucy’s case. Terry and Mary would hold hands as they walked around, he would point out some old trees he futzed around with when he was a kid. Lucy walked way out in front, behaving like a wild animal.

Mary was enjoying the fresh air and fresher buzz. More than anything she was just happy Terry went out with them. She had noticed how he caught glimpses of himself at passing mirrors, lingering at the slight wrinkles in his cheeks. All Mary saw was a rugged Irishman who needed to loosen up a bit and stop worrying so much, they were doing great.

They found themselves coming up on a two story house with brick lining and dozens of jack-o-lanterns covering the front lawn. The lights were on but the blinds were drawn and there were no cars in the long drive. Lucy was stumbling a bit, mumbling to herself as she eyed the front porch. Mare and Tear were chatting as they caught up.

“-My old buddy Marcus Kane used to live in that house, we used to ditch class and sneak beers in the Cheesecake brook.” He laughed to himself, pointing to a vine ensnared house across the way.

“I can’t picture you ditching; it’s like seeing Rocky lose, just inconceivable.” Mary replied.

“Rocky lost in the first movie, love.” Terry stated.

“What? It was a draw.” She said

“Still isn’t a win, innit?” Terry said, the night air mixing well with his somber buzz. “In any case, I was a hellion in my youth. Just one idiotic thing after another.” He flinched as he recalled the last Halloween he went out. Decades ago, a night of debauchery fueled by delinquency and whisky. Not unlike tonight’s misadventure actually.

Mary laid her head on his shoulders, partly for comfort, partly to support her decaying mobility as the drink set in.

“Sounds like young Terry was something of a wildcard.” She teased.

“He was something alright.” Terry muttered to himself. In his head, flashes of his troublesome mates being brought to their knees by gnarled vines and cackling golems played like old war reels. Even now, he could recall their screams of anguish with vivid perfection. The duo took notice of the absolutely faded Lucy. She was stumbling towards the house of a thousand pumpkins, taking one trip filled step after another.

Lucy's vision was abhorrent, the drink taking much of her senses. Yet at the end of the sightly cracked pavement was an oval orange bowl, filled to the brim with king sized Milky Way bars. Her cotton mouth began to salivate as she pictured silky caramel melting on her tongue. She waltzed towards the candy, arms outstretched like a wandering zombie.

Mary and Terry watched their blitzed cohort go for the gold, mild amusement streaking across their gobs.

""There ya go, she'll be satisfied for the night then."" Mary mused.

""If only."" Terry grumbled. ""I don't think I've ever seen her drink this much."" He noted.

""Holidays are-hard for her. Brings back old memories of her mom."" Mary gossiped. Terry simply nodded, deciding to leave that expired can of worms closed for the time being. As Lucy giggled to herself with excitement as she closed in on the bowl, Terry peered down the musty road. The wind lightly jogged, kicking up dry leaves as they scattered. The house light further down were dwindling to a dim hue, and trick-or-treaters were retreating to their homesteads to gorge themselves on sugary delights.

He smiled to himself; the twilight of a Halloween eve didn't always mean doom and gloom after all. But as he squinted, sighting a strange glow materialize down the road, he was instantly reminded of his holiday sins.

The glow was of a marmalade hue, ghostly in its movement as it swayed in the air. As it approached the trio, a figure began to take shape behind it. It was cast in shadow, elvish in stature. The silhouette moved with a jig in its step, like a confident dancer strutting their stuff. Terry's heart froze, and a pale sweat began to drip down his brow as he watched the figure approach them.

Lucy had made it to the oval bowl, her drunken odyssey finally complete. It had been a long twenty-five and a half steps to the bowl, but as she looked down at the cocoa coated gold in front of her, she knew it had been worth it. There was a hastily written note tapped to it, a last-minute addition to a last second decision to simply leave a bowl out. In polite lettering, the note read ""*Please Take One*."" with a little smile at the end.

She scoffed to herself and grabbed a gluttonous handful of the bars. She had stuffed nearly the whole bowl into her sack and hightailed it out of there like the trashed bandit she was. The figure watched her break that sacred rule and clicked his tongue. He loathed those who mocked the sacred rules of this holiday, corny they may appear it times.

Lucy's heels clicked on the pavement as she broke out in a fit of gassed laughter. Mary joined her but Terry?

Terry stood there, a mortified expression on him, his hand clutching the gun in his pocket as the figure revealed itself to them.

He appeared to them, stepping out of the shadows in a blink. The girls winced at the sudden light glaring from the stranger's lantern. The man was strikingly handsome, had a small button noise and a sharp jawline. He was clean shaven and had piercing brown eyes. He wore an unbuttoned snow-white dress shirt with brown overalls, two straps clinging to his slender shoulders. His ears were almost impish, and his hair was wild and unkempt, the color almost distractingly ginger.  He brought the lantern, an old-fashioned lamp with a tiny flame trapped in glass, to his pale face. He smiled, his teeth actually glistening in the timid light. There was an aura of trickery to that grin, lost to all but Terry, still frozen in abject terror.

""Good evening to you fine young ladies, and hello once more to you, Terry my lad."" The stranger spoke up, speaking like he strolled straight out of the rocky road to Dublin.

""Oh, is this one of your buddies you were talking about?"" Mary asked a little too loud in Terry's ear. He struggled to find the words and cursed himself for not speaking up sooner as Lucy waltzed over to the stranger. She took half a bow, nearly toppling over as she did, and put on her best drunken Dracula voice to greet him.

""Good evening, I vant to suck your blood."" She snorted to the unimpressed stranger. He shook his head and turned his attention solely to Terry.

""Oh Terry. Ya haven't learned a thing have ya boyo? Still consorting with wild miscreants who have no respect for tradition.""  The man's face twisted in annoyance. Lucy looked up, taken back by the stranger's curt response.

""Hey, what's your problem ass-wipe."" Lucy slurred. Mary rolled her eyes and tried to pull Mary back. Terry broke out of his fear induced stupor and stepped forward, dragging them both behind him as the stranger looked on.

""We've not trespassed on your laws Jack, they've just had a bit too much of the sauce. You know how it goes."" Terry explained as the girls complained behind his back.

""Always were a lousy liar, or did you fail to notice your friend there."" He pointed an accusatory finger at Lucy. ""She pilfered more than her fair share, blatantly ignored the code of honor."" He roared. Terry's blood pressure skyrocket at that accusation and grabbed Lucy by the shoulders.

""You didn't"" He shouted, his eyes begging for the truth. Lucy shook off his grasp and twirled her sack around, reveling her prize.

""Yeah, so what?"" She turned to Jack, a smug look growing on him. ""It's the end of the night, who cares.""

""You know in olden times, when they caught a thief, they'd cut her grubby hands clean off."" Jack recalled.

""Dude that's a bit much. It's just candy."" Mary called out from behind Terry. She nudged him, trying to rile up a defense to this strange man. Instead, Terrance hushed her and put on a brave front as he tried to talk his way out of the wraith's fury.

""Forgive their insolence-"" He began

""Wow I'm skinning you later."" Lucy interjected.

""-but surly there are worse crimes, truly her only sin is drunken ignorance."" He pleaded. Jack titled his head, mulling that over.

""True enough I suppose. You would know after all."" He smiled, malice seeping out of his pores.

""What's he talking about?"" Mary whispered. Jack's eyes widened in glee.

""He's never spoken of me? I'm not surprised, though I am a bit hurt. Folks call me Stingy Jack, though I prefer just good old Jack. I'm a wanderer of sorts, keeping people on their toes during this wonderous season."" He beamed with pride.  Terry gripped the gun in his pocket, the handle bleeding into his skin.

""Stingy Jack?"" Lucy laughed. Jack shot her a glance. She was stumbling around, dangerously close to stepping on one of the jack-o-lanterns. ""That's the dumbest name I've ever heard, and I know a guy named FurFur."" Jack eyed her legs, a deadly twitch to his face.

""Careful now lass, I wouldn't harm them lanterns if I were you."" He warned. Terry went pale and looked on in horror as Lucy sneered and dangled a foot over one of them.

""Lucy for Christ's sake don't be an idiot."" He shrieked.

""Yeah come on, that's just a dick move."" Mary said, embarrassed by her friend's drunken outburst. ""Why don't we go home and get some decaf in you."" Lucy waved a dismissive hand.

""Oh please, things are just getting fun."" She said, her dangling leg crashing down atop a half-mushed pumpkin. The lantern cried out as it crumpled to bits, the light within being snuffed instantly. Shards of pumpkin guts splattered to the stone pavement, seeds raining down like tiny bullets. The sudden quiet that came with that lantern's final gasp could drown a newborn. Lucy put her hand to her mouth in an exaggerated gasp. ""Oops."" She snickered as Terry brought out his gun. He turned it on Jack, cocking it as he did.

Jack wore a solemn look. Behind him, a thick mist began to roll in. As quickly as it came, it surrounded the group, engulfing them like a hungry wolf. The fog bank danced through the front yard, twirling around the vengeful gourds, their cartoonish expressions looking on at their fallen brethren. Even Lucy was getting a bit weirded out as she stepped back onto the pavement, stumbling to Terry's side. Jack's lantern bloomed, the light within casting an azure glow.

""See I warned you didn't I. That's the problem with you yanks, you don't care for ways of the old world."" Jack growled, his voice filling with venom and starch. His glamoured form began to fall apart. His skin became course yet developed a smooth texture. His head convulsed and took on the shape of a misshapen oval. His skin was chalk white, his hair gone from his scalp. His eyes became two hollow holes with a dim earthly glow. His face was featureless save for those two holes, and a slit mouth that looked carved on. What little teeth remained in that slit were like mini square blocks.

All in all, his head looked like a big, skinned turnip.

His body went through a similar metamorphous, a variety of colors and textures spinning around his torso. gnarled roots wrapped around his limbs like viny spider-webs, the arm holding the lantern becoming a like a clubbed cage. The light within sputtered out in spectral fury, His legs became like trunks; dry bark seemed to root him to the ground, yet he moved freely, dancing a marry dance as he did.

The fog wrapped around everything, seeming to seep out of every stray orifice the phantom had. Jack's hollow eyes regarded the trio like you would a gnat; he cared not for the shaking gun pointed at his produce head.

The girls eyed the swirling fog with unease; it had a stench of rot and sweet squash to it. Terry did well to hide the fear in his weary, pale eyes. But Stingy Jack could see right through the facade.  He made an advance, his truck legs uprooting from the ground and lurching forward, emitting a grating noise like a log being sawed in half.

Terry, to his credit, did not hesitate.

BLAM-BLAM-BLAM

The silver-streaked shots flew through the air, Jack's veggie chest burst with droplets of tangerine tinted sap flying outward. Smoke cooly poured through his wounds, which began to close as quickly as they came. Jack chuckled dryly at the attempt, his carved smile not moving one iota.

""Ah Terrance. You can't kill the will of the season any more than you can tame the wind."" He spoke. Around them the world began to crawl to life. The ground shifted and shock, infected by the insidious mist. Once dull flames began to roar a deep blue, as the Jack-O-Lanterns began their march. Like wilting arms their withered vines came to animated life, dragging their bulbous gourds up. Their faces locked in eternal carves, some happy, some sporting devilish grins. All the pumpkin golems swayed in the breeze as they got their footing. They looked like stick figures come to life, their bodies composed of twisting roots and frayed leaves.

In the trees, the branches shook with such eager ferocity, their contents spilling out into the night. Cotton bats and plastic ghouls flew off out their wooden shackles, sniggering into the night as they surrounded the trio. They made ghastly sounds that chilled to the bone, their faces frozen but their movement quick and twitchy. A bat flapped its wired wings and screeched at Lucy as she batted it away from her head with a yelp.

""You guys are seeing this shit to, right? Or do I need to cut back on the booze."" She hissed at them.

""Both things can be true."" Terry mumbled. Soon they were besieged on all sides by twisted ferns and deadly gourds, creatures brought to life solely to maim. ensnaring roots dangled around the girls' legs, coiling around like vipers. They scratched at their chlorophyl chains, and Terry turned to help but felt a foul wooden arm wrap around his neck. With a laugh Jack pulled him back, and as much as Terry struggled, he couldn't escape that legume loving bastard. He could do nothing, but watch as the pumpkin tentacles had their way, entombing the pair in deadly leaves and fondling wire.

Jack leaned his ripe head next to Terry's, reeking like bad soil. He forced his termite ridden arm under Terry's chin, forcing him to watch the pumpkin patch envelop his friends.

""You watch now Terry."" Jack crooned in his ear. ""Maybe you'll learn this time. Watch my children choke their lungs with rot wood and strip the flesh from their bones."" His voice gurgled with sadistic glee.

Lucy and Mary were drunk, their muscles sore and as the vines began to coil around their throats they wished they hadn't drunk so much. Mary's lime eyes flashed with fury, and she opened her jaws. Two long fangs jutted out, and she sunk them into the weeds. They tasted like sour spinach. But she tore through the ragweed with her fangs, her hands becoming hedge clippers as she began to tear away at the winding plants. The plants recoiled, pain a fresh new sensation, and loosened their twisting grasp.

Lucy howled like a rabid baboon as she thrashed against her own plants. Her skin took on a pale blue hue, a common demon complexation. She flexed her arms, and the rope-like vines snapped like they were tissue paper. Her eyes turned cotten candy pink, the pure color of lust. She grabbed hold of the nearest swaying pumpkin golem and began to rip it to shreds. As she turned it to mulch, the ones still struggling to contain the raging succubus retreated.

The pair stood there panting, their costumes ripped slightly, covered in the gutty works of demonic gourds. The horde took a step back, underestimating the monstrous twins. Jack cocked his head, bewildered at the turn of events. Terry took that split second to reach into his fleece and fetch the holy water he had stashed for later. With some sleight of hand, he flicked the cap off and splashed it onto Jack's stone face. Terry scurried over to his friends as Jack screeched like a banshee, the holy water seeping into him. He clawed at his unmoving face, the sacred ointment searing him as he struggled.

""Ah you fecking worthless pile of shite!"" He screeched. The whore sneered at them, circling them like furious panthers. The trio stood tall with each other, knowing the coming brawl would be unrelenting. Jack stepped into the mist, giving a melted look at them, chunks of his starchy face peeling to the ground. ""Obliterate the lousy cunts."" He ordered.

With that the Halloween horrors advanced. With only three bullets left in his gun, Terry stuck to the sidelines throwing salt and holy water at the marauding beasts, careful not to splash any on Lucy and Mary. The vampire and demon went to town on the horde. Their vampiric and hellish powers fully unleashed on the pumpkins. The horde was armed with seasonal fire and thorns, which did not stand the test of a succubus' nails. The animated decorations buzzed around the battlefield like wasps, swopping down to swat the pair with plastic fury. Lucy grabbed a wiry bat; it screeched as it tried to escape her fiery grip. She hissed as she bit into the bat's neck, and with one quick flick of the neck tore it from the body. Fuzz and blood spurted out like a fountain, lucy spat the head to the ground like a quitter.

A golem tried to sneak up on Terry, who twirled around and swiftly blew it's head off. A smidge of pumpkin meat splattered his chin, the rest fell to the ground in a mushy heap. The blessed salt and water made steaming work of the devilish horde. They cried out in agony as they burned, their mesocarp burned.

Mary was cutting down vine after vine that tried to entangle her, her fangs dripped with sap as she drained the creatures of their lives. The trio was winning, but the horde was never ending, the horrors seeming to spawn out of the fog from thin air. They were battered and bloody, coated in orange entrails. It was only a matter of time before the beats overwhelmed them. All around them they could hear Jack's mocking chortle, and it only hardened their spirts against the tide. Terry turned to his right and saw a golem with a scythe like blade about to strike at Mary.

""Behind you!"" He shouted as he pulled the trigger. The pumpkin reaper was blown away, mary picked up the fallen blade and used it to cleave the oncoming horde. It was a a bloodsoaked harvest. Lucy stumbled, nearly tripping on her fallen sack. She reached into it, grabbing a final warm bear and a candy bar. She snapped the cap off, glaring at a creature coming towards her.

""Swig break."" she said, taking a sour gulp of the hootch as she then bashed the half-drunk bottle against the bumpy hide of the pumpkin monster. It shattered, bits of glass sticking into it. She then preceded to drive the broken bottle into the Jack-O-Lanterns head. She collapsed onto its gangly, stick of a body as she smashed it to bits with the broken bottle, the glass starting to cut into her hands as she drove her bloodied instrument into it.

Terry panted, his chest heaving and his lungs about to shrivel and die in his wheezing body.

""We can't beat this; they'll just keep coming. I'm sorry, to the both of you. This is all my fault."" Terry moaned.

""Hardly, I'm the messy drunk."" Lucy cracked as she tore a giggling sprite out of the sky and hurled it at a lantern at mach-speed.

""No, I can't blame you. I did the same thing myself, egged on by my belligerent pals. I should have told you the real reason I hide inside on Halloween."" Terry lamented, using his last bullet to vaporize a swooping bat.

""Don't beat yourself up Tear. We all do stupid shit when we're kids."" Mary comforted after draining the sanguine sap from a withering monster.  Terry's lips gave way to a weary smile, in spite of the assault. The trio were soon forced into a corner, the fog heavy and the lumbering creatures frothing at the carved mouths.  Stingy Jack appeared behind his gang of ghouls, ghostly light brewing in his lantern hand. He watched as the horde surrounded the exhausted trio, if he could smile from that slit he would have. His veggie face had healed yet still bore a black singe from the water. He would enjoy slowly stripping the meat from Terrance, oh yes, he would take great jo-

*bong,bong,bong,bong-*

A clock tower rang out, midnight. It singled the 1st of November. The fog groaned with each mournful bell, each one a stab in the heart of the mist. The creatures moaned as the Hallowed magic waned, the animated sprites began collapsing to the ground. The golems began to break apart, rotted veggies spilling to the ground, slopping off their stringy stalks in droves.  The trio was bewildered, amazed at the deus ex machina of literally being saved by the bell.

Soon enough all that was left of the creatures was a mountain of foul-smelling pumpkin guts, the ground looked like someone had puke an endless supply of pumpkin stew on the ground. As the mist cleared, the night sky came tumbling back into focus, and the crickets resumed their late-night opera. Stingy Jack stepped forward, reverted back to human form, his lantern the normal, dull glow. He regarded the trio with annoyance, then finally shrugged his shoulders.

""Ah well. Can't win them all I suppose. Interesting company you keep these days, Terrance. I'll keep that in mind for next year."" He simply stated before walking off into the cool night, melting back into the realm of shadows from whence he came. The danger over with, Terry rubbed his knees and winced, as Lucy began adding her own strawberry flavored vomit to the mix around them. For better or worse, they had won.

The trio trudged back home, completely coated in foul smelling lantern guts. Mary was holding Lucy up, who was the perfect kind of blackout drunk where you can sleepwalk home with your eyes completely shut. She was mumbling to herself, something about her mother tanning her hide for coming home late, and Terry assured her no such thing would happen. They finally got home, finding Terry's bowl of sweats empty and his front porch covered in dried yolks.  They collapsed onto his steps, Lucy slouching to the deck out cold. Terry rubbed his aching knees as Mary plopped down next to him, leaning sweetly on his shoulders.

""Bloody knees are killing me."" he mumbled.

""Know how ya feel. Think I threw my back out juggling pumpkin men."" She laughed. ""And that sap isn't gonna set well in the morning."" She grimaced.

""Ah you're young, you'll be in top shape in no time."" He waved.

""I'm not that spry Terry. And you're not that decrepit."" She teased.

""In my glory days, I would have slapped Jack around I tell you that much, would have ran circles around his little pumpkin patch."" he boasted.

""You also said you smashed lanterns and were so much of a general prick that it pissed him off to begin with."" She noted. Terry sat in silence for a moment, while Lucy loudly snored next to them.

""Well-Young Terry was an asshole."" he finally admitted.

""Young Terry sounds like a guy I'd avoid like the plague."" Mary said, sinking into him. ""I like Old Terry."" The pair enjoyed each other in silence for a while longer, enjoying the beautify evening before them. They spent the right of the night with each other, only climbing out of bed to help a dazed, retching Lucy crawl her way to the Bathroom.

All in all, Terry had certainly had worse Halloweens, and as he laid in bed, an adoring woman wrapped around his chest, he couldn't think of anywhere else he'd rather be.",2,1761339368.0,u_Kaijufan22,2,1.0,False

- Can’t make a decent amount of money except enough to get by because my country doesn’t offer any better

- Can’t get a woman to look my way let alone become my girlfriend

- Can’t do anything for fun other than go to a nearby bar for a coffee for the millionth time because I can’t afford anything else

- Can’t afford my own car 

- Basically wasted my entire 26 years on this planet being secluded in a small shithole town that offers nothing and moving out is unaffordable and flat out impossible 

And what awaits me after this? A lifetime of living paycheck to paycheck paying bills and not getting to live for a second all while having health problems that come with age in a country that doesn’t have any type of healthcare?

1of974f,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1of974f/i_am_dating_a_man_with_a_gambling_addiction/,I am dating a man with a gambling addiction.,"I have a boyfriend of a year and a half, and a year ago I found out about his addiction completely by accident, an acquaintance told me about it after seeing him at the slots. I was completely shocked and taken aback and when I confronted him about it he lied at first, but ended up confessing and we almost broke up that day. I was hurt that he lied to me for so long and that I had to find out this way, but I didn't want to leave him because I wanted to help him overcome this.
So I stayed, and we are still together, but it's so exhausting and mentally draining for me. I told him that we were gonna do this together and that I will try to help him as much as I can, but it's not working. He is transparent to me about it, I know when he loses and when he wins but this caused so many arguments in our relationship that it's really strained and it's taking up more than half of our relationship. He's always telling me how he will stop, how he's sick of it, how he will not do it again, but every week it's the same and we have the same conversation over and over again, and I am starting to lose patience. He's living paycheck to paycheck, when he gets it he pays the bills that he literally needs to pay to survive and then gamble everything away and is left with nothing. We don't live together, and he always tells me that because of that it doesn't impact me directly, but the only thing that doesn't impact me is that he is not spending my money. We go on a date literally once every 2 months because he never has the money, and when he does it's either gone or it's a loan from a friend that he literally takes just to survive. I don't want to look like a gold digger, but I am a student and I don't have the time to work because I am focused on school. He doesn't go to college, he works and gets paid monthly. We were planning to live together next year because I am planning to move closer to college and I thought that it would be a perfect opportunity for us to go together, but recently I've told him that I don't even want to think about that idea and to cut it off completely because I can't trust him with money, and if we were live together, it will become OUR money. He claims that he is trying everything to stop, but he really isn't. Half of his friend group are also gamblers, and they literally can't go out for a coffee without literally ruining all of their paychecks, he doesn't want to go to therapy because he ""doesn't have the money for it"" and he doesn't think that it will help him at all and that it's just a waste of time. When he had set his mind to try out therapy, he spent the money so he didn't have any way of going. He won't drop those friends either. I told him that he can't heal and grow in an environment that holds him back constantly, and he agreed and said that he will try to lessen contact with them but he had never done that. I am so exhausted, and the last month or two have been hell because it's every two days of constant arguing and me trying to comfort him when he is sad, but he ends up lashing out on me instead.
This week I had enough of it and snapped in the moment and told him that it's over because he refuses to change and I don't want to live a life with someone who doesn't do anything about his problems, and I never felt worse. I was literally crying so hard to the point where I was almost throwing up and considered taking meds just to calm down a bit. I felt like it was the worst mistake of my life and that I was so selfish because when it's good, it's really good and I really love that man. He is my first relationship and I went through everything with him. I am so attached to him that I literally felt like an addict who got stripped away from drugs for the first time when I couldn't see him and had minimal contact with him. And then I went back to him, because I was feeling so much worse alone than I ever felt with him and I couldn't shake the thought that if I stayed just a bit longer things would get better and I felt completely disgusting and selfish and like the worst person in the world. I was calling him histerically crying saying that I just want us to live a happy, normal life and he said that ""if I had a bit more patience we would, but he understands why I don't"" and that was the end of me. And now we're back together, we were talking and agreed that we would both have to change and while I am much calmer now and we have seen each other, went on a date (took me to dinner and then went to his place) and it was really good, I know that nothing will change overnight and that this won't stop so quickly, and I wonder if I made another mistake going back to him. I don't feel like going through all of that pain and arguing and that mentally draining process again, but I also don't feel like having him in my life. When I'm with friends I feel complete and like I don't need him and all the stress that I know we will go through, but then the second I'm alone I miss him so much and want to be with him. I don't know what to do. It's making me sad just to think about it like that. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want help and who's dragging me down the line with him because I really have big dreams, goals and aspirations and I feel like we move on different levels but I also imagined achieving everything with him by my side. I don't know. I need help. My friends told me that leaving him was the best decision I could have ever made, but it didn't feel right for one second. Of course, they're not happy that we are back together but they know how much I love him and are there to support me no matter what. I never use reddit but I need to ask for unbiased opinions because I'm really lost and sad. We attended my cousin's wedding last month, and we still haven't got back the pictures but he is in all of them and if we eventually break up again, how am I supposed to move on while looking at a picture of him literally hanged on my wall. I am willing to hear everyone out, thank you :(",1,1761339345.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

Coffee prices have been increasing sharply since the start of this year.

In September, a bipartisan group of U.S. House members introduced a bill that would repeal all tariffs on coffee.

“We only produce 1% of the coffee that Americans consume. It’s one of the best examples of Trump’s blanket tariffs making no economic sense,” U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said. Khanna co-sponsored the bill with U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican.

Outside of Hawaii and Puerto Rico, there are few places in the U.S. that can grow coffee. So 99% of America’s coffee is imported, according to the National Coffee Association, a trade group.

Brazil is the top source for U.S. coffee, supplying 30% of the market. The Trump administration imposed a 40% tariff on Brazilian products in July on top of a 10% tariff imposed earlier. Brazilian producers have begun withholding shipments to the U.S. as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added cost, reducing supply in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.

Heat, drought and other poor weather conditions have hurt coffee production globally in recent years, causing prices to surge. World coffee prices rose nearly 40% in 2024, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.",13,1761339214.0,truenews,1,1.0,False

We have been living together since the beginning of our relationship. Over the last few years we have had issues when it comes to bedtime. I enjoy staying up late, and they don’t, they’re normally in bed by 1030. Instead of each of us going to bed when we see fit, they ask me to go to bed when they do because they can’t sleep when I’m not there, and that me coming up at 11:30-12:30, wakes them up. I have expressed that I am not tired and don’t want to go to sleep yet many times. In an effort to meet in the middle, I would go to the bedroom and lie down in bed while on my phone. That however was also a problem, because of the light emitted from the phone. I have purchased them eye covers to help with their light sensitivity but they don’t like to use them. 

We have discussed this many times to no avail and they accuse me of being inconsiderate and insensitive to their needs. I have expressed how them trying to set “appropriate” times for me to sleep and eat is very controlling and unreasonable and that they are treating me like a child.

We both work in the morning, but I guess I just don’t need as much sleep as they do. I work from home and they don’t. I’m never hungry in the morning, I just have coffee. I don’t usually get hungry until late afternoon, shortly before they get home. This creates a problem for them because they don’t like that I’m not eating dinner when they are, even though I have been very clear about not being hungry and not wanting to force feed myself. 

I don’t think it’s normal to have this dynamic where one person dictates the appropriate time for sleeping and eating and I have said this many times. My partner however thinks it’s inconsiderate of me to not consider their needs regarding sleep. I have suggested that we try sleeping in separate rooms and then everyone is happy, but they don’t like that idea.

Anyone else feeling like the Tin Man some days? 🤖 Seriously, getting out of bed sometimes feels like a full-body workout! As we gracefully (or not so gracefully!) glide past the half-century mark, things start creaking and groaning that we didn't even *know* could creak and groan.

But here’s the good news: it doesn't have to be this way! You don't have to resign yourself to a life of ""oof"" noises every time you stand up. We believe in strongest people. And I'm talking about regaining some of that youthful spring in your step. [https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb)

So, what's the secret? Magic potions? A time machine? Nope! Just a few simple mobility moves you can work into your day.

Think of it like this: you wouldn't let your car sit in the garage for years without turning it on, right? Your body is the same – it needs to *move*!

Here are 3 easy things you can start with TODAY:

*   **Shoulder Rolls:** Seriously, these are SO underrated. Just gentle circles forward and backward. Do them while you're waiting for the coffee to brew! My shoulders used to feel perpetually hunched, and this has made a huge difference.

*   **Hip Circles:** Imagine you're hula hooping (remember those days?!). Just small, controlled circles. This helps loosen up those hips and can ease lower back pain. I do these while watching TV – subtle but effective!

*   **Ankle Pumps:** Sitting down? Great! Just point your toes up and down, working those ankles. Improves circulation and helps prevent stiffness. Perfect for long car rides or plane trips too!

See? Nothing crazy! It's about consistency, not intensity. Ten minutes a day is better than an hour once a month.

Remember that time I pulled my back reaching for a jar of pickles? 😂 Yeah, I'm *definitely* prioritizing mobility these days.

What small things are you doing to keep your body happy and flexible? Anyone else feel like they need WD-40 in the mornings? Let's share some tips!

1of8zsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlumlordsCanada/comments/1of8zsd/no_more_rent_control/,NO MORE RENT CONTROL????????,"Hi, 
THIS IS A SERIOUS POST, DO NOT SKIP! 

Doug Ford just proposed a series of inhumane oppressive changes to Rental Laws as they are currently constructed in Ontario. 

The worst of which is the following:

Once a tenant-landlord lease is up, the landlord can require the tenant to leave unless tenant agrees to pay amount requested by landlord, OVER AND ABOVE RENTAL INCREASE GUIDELINE  

For now, in buildings built before 2018, once a fixed term lease is up, it automatically converts to a month to month lease and the landlord may only increase the rent yearly once by the rental minimum guideline which is 2.5%.

Doug Ford is planning to remove this protection that tenants have. Thus a landlord can ask tenants to pay much more than a 2.5% yearly increase.

THIS ENDS RENTAL CONTROL PROVISIONS! 

Unfortunately it doesnt end here.
The changes proposed also seek to:

1.)give landlord more rights to evict tenants and pursue recourse against non/late payments 

2.) Give tenants fewer options to appeal/challenge legal decisions; disallow introducing new issues they have with landlords; and reduce notice periods in favor of landlords.

As you can see, it is a highly concerted effort at increasing landlord powers and profits while further subjugating tenants into the abyss of poverty and slaverly (modern day). 

I urge everyone to sign the petition: https://acorncanada.org/news/doug-ford-moves-to-end-rent-control/

I also urge everyone to wake up and stop falling for the political trap of busying us with non existant problems that are sensationalized i.e others out to get us. 

We are in this mess because we fell into the trap of arguing about trivial matters such as the race of people that commit violence; framing criminals as outsider ""migrants""; taking our land back from rhe ""terrorists""; and this existential ""threat"" to our ""democracy"" by poot third world uber drivers. 

Wake up and smell the coffee

I'm autistic and have always struggled with attending and participating in coffee hour no matter where I was at. But that's something I'd like to improve.

Does anyone have any advice?

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

1. The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.
2. Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.
3. The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.
4. Accountability is the highest form of self-love. Every time I feel like procrastinating, I get a motivational message from my past self using [this app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journai-smart-planner/id6744276337). Nothing more motivating than hearing myself beg.
5. Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).
6. Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

1of8w2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1of8w2k/aiofast_food_work_problems_am_i_the_asshole/,AIO/Fast food work problems…. Am I the asshole?,"Okay, so like, help me out? I work at a popular fast food chain, I originally started with the intentions of being AGM and had planned to work my way up from crew (I have the qualifications and I’ve done it before.) I was really sold on the training they said they’d offer, they made it sound like it would be super in depth and I honestly just think I’m naive to expect any differently than I’ve had in the past. The training sucked, like some of the worst I’ve had and I learned most of what I know either by myself or from co workers not assigned to train, just trying to help out real quick. I didn’t pick it up as fast as they wanted and honestly I’m pretty sure that sucked worse for me than them bc who wants to be that person? It wasn’t for lack of trying, I can promise you that. It’s just fast paced w not a lot of direction which I’ve had before, so idk why this one took longer than normal for me. FF, it’s been a few months and I’m still crew, I’ve learned like 2 of 5 positions and I had a crazy family emergency that ripped me out of work for like 3 weeks, and when I got back I had to completely change my availability. They worked w me and I was completely floored, I was ready to quit that job and find a new one that allowed me to be w my family as much as I needed to. So when I got back, I was dead set on being the most loyal fucker in that place. It got so stupid so fast. I’m a heavy nicotine user and they do not allow me to take care of that the way I need to. Like, I’m not the kind of person that needs to leave every 10 minutes to smoke, I talk shit about those people. I need like 10 minutes a day for anything longer than 4 hours and it’s a point of tension in my work place. And honestly this next part is the most childish shit I’ve ever dealt w in a work place, but there was a week when I had a fucked up stomach and I was shittin my brains out, I wasn’t sick, I played myself by eating things that I really should’ve been avoiding if I’m being honest. I don’t have an excuse for that, I shouldn’t have done that. I was just goin thru it and it wasn’t even food that got me, it was the 2-3 pots of black coffee. I know that it fucks w me, it’s just comforting too. I have a bum rib that usually doesn’t give me issue but it’s hard when you’re stomach is fucked up. I tried to be transparent and apologetic and that whole thing is my fault, it’s not theirs. I know that. I was going frequently, but nothing like the 20 minutes some people take. They didn’t believe that my stomach was fucked, they started saying that I was just chillin hitting my vape and it pissed me off beyond reason. My attitude was pretty bad for a week or two but my current AGM and I cleared the air. FF again and I still don’t get a break unless I bring it up which I shouldn’t have to, I’m not even in management yet. If I didn’t have to clock out to hit my vape this probably wouldn’t even be an issue, but I’m not about to hit my vape on the clock bc I hate breaking rules. I’m pretty sure it’s fireable too. And now, they give me a hard time anytime I need to go to the bathroom. I pee a lot, ngl, I drink a lot of water when I’m moving around at work, but it’s been the same this whole time. If I work like 6 hours, I’ll pee fs like twice, maybe 3 times but it’s like 2-3 minutes, I’m not just playing games in there. Idk, my manager today told me “playfully” (in the passive aggressive manager way) that he was gonna start having me clock out to go to the bathroom… CRAZY. He also commented on how much water I drink and like, idk, am I supposed to be sorry that I drink a lot of water… I don’t think it’s excessive, this is what I’ve always done and in my ten years of kitchen experience I have NEVER had problems getting nicotine or going to the bathroom/drinking water…. Like, these seem like such silly problems to be dealing w lmao. At this point, I’m checked out. Like, I don’t hate the job I just don’t care, like, I don’t think about these people when I leave, this job is meaningless. They hate me and I’m just chillin and it makes them hate me more I think… but I seriously don’t care. When they say dumb passive aggressive things to me I give it right back and I think it makes it way worse but like, I don’t care to behave. I’m not like showing my ass but like, you think imma watch what I say? I don’t give a fuck, you give me a hard time about peeing. I’m just collecting a check. I’m looking for a new job outside of food and I’m hoping I get it, so I’m not worried about how to navigate it bc hopefully I’ll be out of food in general but like, someone in food tell me what they think.

Hieee, I’m an artsy, free-spirited type.Love sketching, dancing, playing tennis,over analyzing random songs, or getting lost in new places. I love people who balance me out; 
the grounded, tech-savvy, curious ones who can explain how things work while I bring the chaos and color. I’m intuitive, playful, and a little mischievous at times, but mostly just looking to connect with people who appreciate contrast,art and logic/passion and peace.

If you’re more on the nerdy or analytical side and like people who live in the clouds a bit, we’ll probably get along. 

Also I’ll be in New England soon next month,if you’re from there or around the area and want to grab coffee, explore, or just hang out, let me know! Always down to meet cool people and make new memories ✨

1of8v6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberCurious/comments/1of8v6x/41_days_binge_free/,41 days. Binge free.,"Currently lay in bed waiting to get sleepy, just gonna share my thoughts. 

As title reads very proud of myself to not have binged this long. I feel this may be the longest period without for most likely 4+ years. 

I can’t lie-  I have had an urge today to have a good drink but I reminded myself how it will not be worth it. As I lay in bed, i feel so content with my life and my self esteem which I feel has been on upward trajectory since stopping.

The contentness (I know that’s not a word) I feel right now is beautiful. I don’t feel overly elated and full of joy but just right- a satisfying feeling. I’m satisfied with myself, my relationships, my health and my lifestyle. I have goals and dreams. I look forward to the small things like coffee in the morning, the feeling after I exercise and spending time with those I love. 

When I drank heavy and often it was rare I felt contentment, I felt that alcohol set the bar too high in day to day normal life. I felt everything I tried to partake in hobbies, goals+relationships never matched  the joy binging would give me- everything felt that bit more dull. I’ll be honest the time period of drinking 6/7 hours - felt great as the did the excitement that comes with. But it’s not worth the feeling of safety and fulfilment I have now.  

That’s off my chest. I’m honestly using this space as a therapy outlet and reading everyone’s experiences is really enlightening/inspiring . Love to hear from others.

Last night was our September game, and we had a lot of fun, with a really good turn out.

For those who've not seen my posts before, I host a live unsanctioned Um, Actually trivia night once a month in my town, at a local board gaming lounge.  I write all my own statements, and make all my own Shiny questions (I used to borrow from this sub, but I've exhausted all the content), even if I do use formats from the actual show like Fictionary, We're Not So Different You and I, Order Up!, etc.  Mine are all original.  I have made a lot of small tweaks and structure changes to make it more mine, but anyone who's ever watched the actual show will feel right at home if they come to one of my trivia nights.

This month was ""The Um Actually Horror Show"", we had record turnout (we'd been hyping it for a couple months) with twelve teams of 3-8 people each.  This was our Halloween show, and it was all horror and Halloween themed!  Shiny questions were renamed ""Bloody"" Questions.  It was a GREAT night, everyone had a ton of fun, people were jumping in with answers and laughing and really testing their horror knowledge.

Anyway, here's this month's statements, and I'll describe this month's Shinies in the comments!  I'm also going to share the Shinies as their own posts for people to challenge themselves.


**STEPHEN KING**

In 1996, Stephen King teamed up with author Richard Bachman to publish Desperation and The Regulators, a pair of “mirror” novels.  The books were written as parallel universes relative to each other, with most of the characters present in each world, just under different circumstances.  Both books revolve around characters encountering a powerful supernatural entity named Tak, which was released from a mine. 

UM ACTUALLY: >!Stephen King is Richard Bachman, it's his alternate pen name.!<


**EDGAR ALLEN POE**

The Pit And The Pendulum is a harrowing supernatural tale of a prisoner of the Spanish Inquisition, condemned to death. Trapped in a pitch-dark cell, the prisoner discovers that his chamber contains a deep pit, which he almost falls into. Later, he awakens on a wooden rack, a foot-wide pendulum blade slowly descending on him. He manages to escape by getting the rats to eat his bindings, and nearly falls into the pit again, when he’s saved by the French Army, who has captured the city.

UM ACTUALLY: >!It’s not supernatural at all.  Pit And The Pendulum is actually known for being one of the few Poe works that has no supernatural elements whatsoever.!<


**TERRIFIER**

In 2018 director Damien Leone released Terrifier, introducing the world to Art The Clown, a ghoulishly gleeful slasher with a perpetual grin and a little black hat, known for his comically over-the-top kills. Art has become so popular that he’s spawned three Terrifier movies with a fourth on the way, as well as A Very Special Terrifier Christmas, multiple Call Of Duty appearances, and his own upcoming video game, Terrifier: The ARTcade Game.

UM ACTUALLY: >!Art debuted years before Terrifier, in a few short films, and the anthology film All Hallow's Eve in 2013!<


**SAW**

In Saw II, Det. Eric Matthews is called in on a new Jigsaw game.  A series of monitors watching a house where seven criminals from Matthews’ past are trapped, along with an eighth victim:  Matthews’ own son Daniel. Matthews is told if he plays by the rules, his son will be found in a safe place.

Unable to control himself, Matthews interferes with the game and forces John to lead him to the house, where it is revealed that the video was prerecorded, and he is too late to save his son. Matthews is knocked unconscious, and wakes up trapped in a game of his own.  

UM ACTUALLY: >!Daniel was fine, he was locked in a safe with an oxygen tank in the room with the monitors.!<


**SCOOBY-DOO**

The Hex Girls are a Gothic rock band, portrayed by Jennifer Hale, Jane Wiedlin and Kimberly Brooks, who first appeared in Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island. Originally introduced as potential suspects, the band winds up helping the gang solve the case through Thorn’s Wiccan heritage. The girls were so popular that they would later appear in several other Scooby-Doo movies and shows, and are now seen as queer culture and girl power icons.

UM ACTUALLY: >!They did not appear in Zombie Island, they premiered in Scooby Doo And The Witch’s Ghost.!<

**SIMPSONS TREEHOUSE OF HORROR**

In Treehouse Of Horror V, one of the movie parodies has the Simpsons agreeing to be winter caretakers for Mr. Burns’ lodge.  Before leaving, Burns and Smithers cut off the cable and remove all the beer, causing Homer to go mad and try to murder the family. Bart uses The Shining to summon Groundskeeper Willie to save them, but Homer kills him with an axe as soon as he walks in the door.  In the end, Homer’s rage is sated with a portable TV, and the family winds up frozen together.

UM ACTUALLY: >!It’s THE SHINNING, do you want to get sued?!<

**THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW**

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, making it the longest running theatrical release in history!  After bombing in theaters in its initial run with a box office of only $1 million in its first year, the racy sci-fi horror musical found its cult audience in midnight showings, often paired with other campy movies.  A follow-up was planned, called “Rocky Horror Shows His Heels”, but when Tim Curry declined to return, it was canceled and no sequel was ever made.

UM ACTUALLY: >!A sequel was made, it's called Shock Treatment.!<


**BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER**

In the Season Four episode, “Fear Itself”, Buffy and friends attend a frat house Halloween party.  Wanting the décor to look cool, one of the frat boys accidentally paints a very real magical symbol on the floor of the house, and everyone’s greatest fears start becoming reality. Thinking that it’ll break the spell, Buffy destroys the symbol on the floor, just as Giles tells her that doing this will summon the demon.  Once she does, an enormous Fear Demon named Gachnar, Dark Lord Of Nightmares rises from the floor.

UM ACTUALLY: >!Gachnar is six inches tall.  The book Giles is reading from has a picture, and he translates the caption as ""actual size"".!<


**SILENT HILL**

Silent Hill released on the Playstation in 1999, ushering in a new world of psychological terror. While it was not without its share of gore and jump scares, Silent Hill relied on more subtle and innovative ways to set itself apart in the growing survival horror genre. Monsters were obscured in the dense fog of the town, but a broken radio would let the player know they were near with crackling bursts of static, and rather than showing a health bar onscreen, players could determine Harry’s health via the sound of an EKG monitor beeping faster as they took damage, building a sense of fear and dread as they explored the town.

UM ACTUALLY: >!It was not the sound of an EKG, the PS1 was one of the first consoles to have rumble built into the controller; you felt Harry's heartbeat in the controller.!< 

**DEAD SPACE**

When Isaac Clarke arrives on the USG Ishimura, he’s hoping to find his girlfriend Nicole safe and sound.  Instead, he finds himself trapped on a ship with a host of undead monsters called Necromorphs. Astute players have noticed a bit of a warning left in the game’s chapter titles, however. Starting with the first chapter, “New Arrivals”, the first letter of each chapter spells out, “NECROMORPH”.

UM ACTUALLY: >!The chapter titles spell out NICOLEISDEAD, because Nicole is a hallucination the whole time.!<

**BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL**

In Betrayal At House On The Hill, players are assigned hidden roles as they set out to explore a spooky mansion! Players will draw tiles, building the basement, ground floor, and upper floors, and these tiles may give them Events, Items, or Omens. When an Omen is drawn, players roll a Haunt check, and if it succeeds then the Haunt begins! The traitor reveals themselves, players check the Haunt chart to see which story it will be, and read the scenario’s rules for the rest of the game. 

UM ACTUALLY: >!Roles are not handed out at the beginning.  No one knows who the traitor is until the Haunt begins.!<


**VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE**

Vampire: The Masquerade takes place in the fictional World Of Darkness, a gothic parallel to our own world where supernatural beings like vampires and werewolves live in the shadows. The Masquerade refers to the efforts of the vampires, or “Kindred”, to hide the existence of the supernatural from mortal humans. It is upheld by the Camarilla, a coalition of different Clans who defend the Masquerade from the Brujah, chaotic vampires who see themselves as the superior beings.   

UM ACTUALLY:  >!The anti-Camarilla vampires are called the Sabbat.  Brujah are one of the vampire clans who defend the Camarilla!<


**JUNJI ITO**

One of Junji Ito’s most infamous short manga stories is The Enigma Of Amigara Fault, in which an earthquake exposes a rock face with hundreds of human-shaped holes.  Scientists examining the holes determine that they had to have been dug from the inside out, which seems impossible.  Some people begin to find that certain holes call to them and are perfectly shaped silhouettes of their body, as one man yells, ""This is my hole! It was made for me!"" and disappears inside. People begin climbing into their holes, never to be seen again.

UM ACTUALLY: >!They were seen again.  The ending of the story is a second earthquake that reveals the other side of the rock face, with twisty cracks in it.  The people are seen coming out of the cracks, twisted, bent, stretched and warped!<


**WALKING DEAD**

After escaping Woodbury, Rick, Glenn, and Daryl make it back to the prison safely, not realizing that Michonne has left the Governor mutilated, but alive.  Things seem peaceful and idyllic for a brief moment, until the Governor attacks the prison with a tank, in a violent battle that sees the deaths of Tyreese, Lori, and Rick’s newborn daughter, Judith.  The Governor is defeated, but the prison is all but destroyed, and the survivors are forced to move on.

UM ACTUALLY: >!Daryl does not exist in the comics.  He is only in the show.!<


**DEATH NOTE**

Misa Amane is hunting down Kira in order to support his mission. After obtaining her own Death Note, Misa strikes a deal with Shinigami Rem for the Shinigami Eyes, sacrificing half of her life span for the power to learn a person's name and lifespan just by seeing their face.  After being arrested, Misa later gives up ownership and memories of the Death Note and loses the Shinigami Eyes. Once she regains her memories and uncovers her lost Death Note, she makes a second deal with Rem to get her Shinigami Eyes back, essentially quartering her remaining life span.

UM ACTUALLY: >!Misa's second deal is not with Rem, it's with Ryuk.!<


**TOKYO GHOUL**

Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate version of Tokyo where humans coexist with ghouls, beings who look like humans but eat human flesh to survive. Ken Kaneki finds himself turned into a ghoul after nearly dying from a construction accident on a date with a ghoul, and having some of his date’s organs transplanted into his own body to save his life. Ken is taken in by some ghouls at a coffee shop called Anteiku, who teach him how to live a normal life, and stay hidden from normal humans.

UM ACTUALLY: >!Ken is not a full ghoul, he is a “one-eyed ghoul” which is a half-ghoul.!<

**WELCOME TO NIGHT VALE**

Welcome to Night Vale takes place in the fictional town of Night Vale, New Mexico.  The story is told through Night Vale's nightly radio broadcast, hosted by Cecil Gershwin Palmer, and consists of long-form storytelling filled with surreal characters like the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home, Hiram McDaniels the five-headed dragon, and the noxious Glow Cloud, which became president of Night Vale’s school board.

UM ACTUALLY: >!The state Night Vale is in has never been specified. It's kind of like Springfield in the Simpsons.!<

**HALLOWEEN (The holiday, not the movie)**

Halloween’s roots go back further than you might think!  More than 2000 years ago, the Celts celebrated Samhain, which marked the end of harvest, and the beginning of winter. The lines between the world of the living and the dead were blurred, which led to traditions like wearing costumes to ward off spirits, divination games, and bobbing for apples. By the 16th century, they were carving pumpkins, and “guising”, going house to house in costumes asking for food.  This of course, would evolve into what we now call trick-or-treating!    

UM ACTUALLY: >!They were carving turnips, not Pumpkins.  Pumpkins are native to the US, and did not become part of the tradition until much later.!<


**HISTORY - GUILLOTINE**

During the reign of Louis XVI in France, the guillotine was proposed as a humane and painless method of execution, an alternative to the cruel Saint Catherine’s Wheel. The first recorded use was a highwayman named Nicolas Pelletier in 1792, while the “Reign Of Terror” from 1793-1794 would see more famous heads roll, such as Marie Antoinette and Maximilien Robespierre.  The guillotine remained the official method of execution in France until its final use on June 17th, 1939.

UM ACTUALLY: >!1939 was the final public use, but it would continue to be used for execution until Sept 10th, 1977, on murderer Hamida Djandoubi!<


**HISTORY - SALEM WITCH TRIALS**

Samhain may be a night for witches to celebrate, but back in colonial Massachusetts, things weren’t so festive. The Salem Witch Trials from 1692 to 1693 were a dark time, when accusations of witchcraft were cast, and those found guilty were executed. Nineteen alleged witches were burned at the stake, and one other died under torture when he refused to plea, pressed to death by stones. Tragically, years later, several of the accusers admitted that they had lied, and that those put to death were innocent.

UM ACTUALLY: >!Burning at the stake was a myth.  They were hanged.!<",3,1761338263.0,UmActually,1,1.0,False

He has terrible reflux (we are in the uk and waiting for his paeds appointment to rule out CMPA). He is on omeprazole which helps but he is still unhappy a lot of the times.

He also wont nap when he is tired. I have read a shitload of baby sleep guides and books. I tried working with sleepy cues, wake windows, schedules AND contact napping but half of the time he just wont sleep and keep screaming during nap time. 


The combination of these has made him a grumpy baby. He will wake up happy but then as the day progresses he becomes unsettled and starts screaming from afternoon till bedtime.


I have no idea how to take him out though! Half of the time he is literally screaming and rest of the time I am trying put him to sleep which is bloody precious at this point. The moment I try to put a coat or cardi on him he becomes upset, never mind the car seat or carrier. He can sleep in the carrier though as he has slept there few times. I have still taken out him to coffee shops and parks… long story short, it was not worth it. 



I have depression for more than 15 years and I am on a complex regime of anti depressant and mood stabilisers (baby is formula fed). I am under specialist perinatal mental health team and has received therapy in the past and will restart soon. However, with depression and mental health illness, there is no alternative to lifestyle changes!


I need to go out for walks and fresh air for myself and for my baby and I feel guilty that I can’t! 


Everyone keeps telling me how the baby needs to learn to cope with the outside world and I feel so trapped! 
I also see friends having holiday with their kids of all ages (apparently 3 month old is the best!)  and feel like I am missing something.

We tried to do a mini vacation but failed miserably as baby just kept screaming the whole time. We ended up coming home after 1 day! 


I have no family nearby and my husband and I trying our best. But I feel that I am going to drown soon and this just can’t go on? Please tell me there is light at the end?

1of8qyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1of8qyj/im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_today/,I'm at the end of my rope today.,"My 1 month old baby has been up since 7am (9 hours now). She's had a 20 minute nap and slept for an hour in the car today. Her wake windows have been hours long. I have not been able to get her to take an actual nap in her bassinet today. She is fed, changed/dry, and in clean clothes. I have not been able to calm her down all day. I've held her, changed her, fed her, burped her, rocked her, walked around the house, talked to her, put her in her DreamNest to watch me while I worked in the kitchen, everything I could think of. She's currently screaming at the top of her lungs in her swing while I try to get her to finally calm down and take a nap. Every time she calms down in the swing, she starts screaming bloody murder again. She usually does this when she's strapped into something but settles quick. 

I got no sleep last night and I'm running on coffee. I'm absolutely exhausted and I literally want to pull my hair out. And I'm pretty sure I'm going to have the first baby night shift tonight too. 

She slept so well yesterday. 1-2 hour naps, 1 hour wake windows, had perfect sleep windows overnight, fed on a consistent schedule and finished all her bottles.

1of8q4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1of8q4x/heres_why_your_ads_keep_dying_and_what_awareness/,Here’s Why Your Ads Keep Dying and What Awareness Has to Do With It,"Let’s be real for a second.
Scaling ads used to feel easier, right?

You’d find a banger creative.
It would print money for weeks.
Then suddenly… now they die in 7 days, CPMs go up every month, and you’re stuck refreshing dashboards like your life depends on it.

But here’s what no one tells you
it’s not just your creatives.
It’s who you’re talking to.

There are 5 stages your audience moves through:

Unaware → Problem Aware → Solution Aware → Product Aware → Most Aware.

Think of it like dating.
You don’t propose on the first date.
You build interest → trust → connection → then commitment.

Let’s break it down.

1️⃣ Unaware

These are the people scrolling through their feeds with zero clue they even have a problem.
They’re not looking for your product.
They’re just… vibing.

So when your ad screams “BUY NOW,” they scroll right past it.

Here, your only job is to make them feel something.
A spark of curiosity. A little “wait, what?” moment.

Example - if you sell hydration supplements:
“You’re not tired. You’re dehydrated.”
Boom. You just planted a seed.

It’s not about selling. It’s about making them notice the problem exists.

2️⃣ Problem Aware

Now they’re starting to realize, “Something’s off — I’m not sleeping well.”
They’re tossing and turning, waking up tired, maybe blaming stress or too much screen time.
They know there’s a problem… they just don’t know how to fix it yet.

This stage isn’t about pushing your brand, it’s about showing them there’s hope.
That the problem they’re facing isn’t random, it’s solvable.

Example:
“You’re not lazy. Your body’s just running on broken sleep cycles and no amount of coffee can fix that.”

That kind of message doesn’t sell a product.
It sells awareness.

Because the moment someone realizes,
“Oh, wait… that’s me,”
you’ve already done 80% of the work.

Now they’re listening.

Use educational or story-style creatives here short videos, simple carousels, founder talking-to-camera stuff.
Something that says, “Hey, I’ve been there. Here’s what I learned.”

3️⃣ Solution Aware

Now they know what kind of fix exists they just don’t know you.

This is where you introduce your brand, but not in a desperate “pick me!” way.
Show what makes you different.
Simpler, faster, smarter, cooler whatever your real edge is.

Example:
“Most hydration powders taste chalky and artificial. Ours? Real fruit. Zero sugar.”

Now they’re comparing, and your job is to stand out clearly without shouting.

4️⃣ Product Aware

At this point, they’ve seen your ads. Maybe even clicked through.
They’re on the fence.

You win them here with proof.
Show real humans loving your stuff. Reviews, testimonials, unboxings, before-after moments.

Basically: “Look, people like you already trust us, and it works.”

No one wants to be first to try something new. They just want to feel safe buying.

5️⃣ Most Aware

These are your warmest people. Past customers, cart abandoners, followers who always like your stuff but haven’t bought yet.

You don’t need to convince them. You just need to nudge.

Personal, friendly reminders work best here.
“Back in stock.”
“Early access.”
“Your favorite scent just dropped in XL size.”

Talk to them like insiders, because they are.

Why All This Matters

If your ads keep dying fast, it’s not because “the algorithm hates you.”
It’s because all your content is yelling at people who aren’t ready to listen.

Most brands only talk to the Most Aware - the 10% who already want to buy.
But the real growth? It’s in the other 90%.
The ones who don’t even know you exist yet.

When you start matching your message to where people actually are…
Everything changes.

Your top-of-funnel doesn’t just get cheaper, it starts feeding the rest of your funnel naturally.
Your retargeting ads don’t feel like begging, they feel like reminders.
And suddenly… scaling doesn’t feel like fighting gravity anymore.

If I were you, I’d open your ad library tonight and ask yourself:
“Which stage is this ad talking to?”
If everything’s screaming “buy now,”
you just found your scale problem.

If you want to start scaling again (without burning through your ad budget),
come hang out with us inside [DTC Magnet](https://whop.com/dtc-magnet).
We’ll show you how to build the system that actually compounds.

1of8pvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/EMDR/comments/1of8pvl/contact_with_the_spiritual_community/,Contact with the spiritual community.,"I have been going to meetups to meet new people. It's part of my new expansion to find friends and meaningful interactions. It's been interesting. My new persona is dynamic, intuitive, humorous, spontaneous, settled, confident, caring and considerate. With that, though, is a notable energy that others just simply don't have. I have a power of being that is a force. A presence. People feel it, subconsciously. It can be intense for them. I get that. I follow the lead from others. To mesh energies. I can meet someone and we can go for coffee and talk for a couple of hours. Fantastic back and forth. I surprise myself. This fearless confidence and solid foundation of presence I have noticed and enjoyed for a bit now. That keeps evolving. The spirituality at the core of this energy has become more conscious and in the forefront. So, I have been gravitating toward spiritual kinds of meetups. Native American drumming circles. Empaths, psychic groups. Eastern practices. Thai Chi. Quite interesting. 

You see, from EMDR practices we come to embody the Truth. The truth is spirit. It's infinite. Outside of time. We have it. It's part of the universe of infinite collective consciousness. The collective subconscious. We have that, all of us do, but we can actually come to a self realization that we are that consciousness. And operate from that.

I wanted to know, how this whole thing fits together. These various expressions and experiences of spiritual truth. How do they fit together? If they do at all. 

I went to a psychic group yesterday. I was determined to experience what they had to say. From exactly where they were at. Could we, energetically and intellectualy, understand each other? I think we did. I learned a lot. We connected on the things of higher consciousness. We had different terms for things, and experieces that we could express, but there was a connection.

Heres the take away from ever group I have beed to. They are needing trauma work. That is apparent. The spiritually oriented groups that I have been to, people open up to me. Not necessarily just to me, but in my presence. Me being a total stranger. And a man. Deeply painful personal stories. The atmosphere of the group is a safe place for that. Being amoung trusted, conscious human beings. We did relate on a higher frequency. We shared our humanity as well.

They were unmistakably in need of trauma work. Spiritual experience and altered level of consciousness could not cure that. I knew that. I lived in a yoga ashram through my 20's. It did not heal me. The trauma does not go away with exposure to higher levels of healing frequencies. It just didn't work for me. Now I'm healed. That's what can happen with following this bottom up journey of true healing. That you all are doing. 

So, Im haveing coffee with an astrology practitioner tomorrow morning. I have never believed in astrology. Now I'm not sure. All of my beliefs and biases have been resuffled. We'll see! ✌️",2,1761338160.0,EMDR,0,1.0,False

Fairly coarse grind, 15g.  45g bloom for 2 mins, then a single spiral pour up to 255g.  Water temp was 94C.  Swirl after bloom and after pouring.  LH technique. 

Second attempt I just upped the temp to 98C to see if I could pull more flavour out.  I know DAK recommend 99C for their Berry Blues Ethiopian, so I thought it was worth a try going hotter... But It was just noticeably bitter...  Not better.

Okay, so I started talking to this guy on Facebook dating 2 days ago. We established that neither one of us is ready for an actual relationship, so we're going to be friends. We haven't met face-to-face, but today he brought me my favorite coffee and some things from the Smoke Shop with receipts for both. None of the packaging from the smoke shop had been opened or tampered with.  I did give him my address, and he knows I don't live alone. He was really respectful and left them in the mailbox for me like I had asked. I also made him a batch of cookies. He has told me that he does plan to eventually ask me out, but right now he wants to establish a friendship first. He didn't ask for anything in return and understands my skepticism about him being nice just because. I've never had any genuine guy friends; they've always wanted something in exchange, so I'm not sure if he's a red flag or a green flag. He's been super honest with me, especially about his mental health and that he hasn't dated in over 6 years. He has a completely clean record, takes medication for his MH, and genuinely seems like a good guy. Any interactions I've ever had with a guy usually end up being negative. For example, my last serious relationship was with my son's father, and he turned out to be a narcissist and an abuser. I don't want to go through the same thing. Idk, I guess I'm just worried he might not be as good as he claims to be. He seems to be really respectful of my boundaries, though. Should I give him the benefit of the doubt and let him prove himself that he really does want to be friends and isn't expecting anything in return? ",1,1761338009.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1of8ju5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1of8ju5,Zombicider (Black Tea),"Recipe:

1 Oz Hamilton 151

1.5 Oz Don Q Gold (or equivalent golden Puerto Rican Rum)

0.75 Oz Planteray Xaymaca 

0.75 Oz Smith & Cross (Could do any Jamaican blend totaling 1.5 ounces) 

0.5 Oz Falernum (recipe below)

1 Oz Masala Chai syrup  (recipe below)

0.75 Oz Coconut cream

2 Oz apple cider

1 Oz acid adjusted apple cider  (I acid adjusted it to match lime juice acidity)

3 drops saline

3 dashes Tiki bitters 

2 dashes Angostura bitters 

A copious amount of mint because it refuses to die off in the garden even after multiple frosts, so might as well put it to good use. 


Method:  In a shaker tin combine all of the ingredients.  Shake with a few ounces of crushed ice for 10-15 seconds.  Dirty dump into a nice big glass and top with a bit more crushed ice.  Garnish with a big ol' heap of mint.  



Recipes:  
Falernum (Anders Erickson's) recipe
4 oz (120 ml) overproof rum (I used Wray & Nephew)

6 limes, zested

50g (~4 tbs) toasted almonds

12 whole cloves

15g chopped ginger (peels removed)

1/2 tsp grated nutmeg

1/2 vanilla bean with seeds (split, seeds scraped)

8 oz (240 ml) semi-rich simple syrup (1.5:1 sugar:water)

Toasted the almonds and cloves together, then combined everything but the syrup in a Mason jar, shaking every time I walked by for 24 (27, but who's counting). Strained through a coffee filter then pressed by hand to get as much goodness put as possible, then mixed with syrup.


Masala Chai syrup:  I followed this recipe, but added a couple of star anise to the spice blend.  Made a liter (half the original recipe), and used 19 Twinings Extra Strong Breakfast tea bags (meant to use all 20, one was hidden in the box and I missed it - still came out awesome).  
https://www.plantbasedredhead.com/en/chai-syrup/#recipe


Acid adjusted apple cider:  

I used the spreadsheet that's available on google drive, that I found in this subreddit, and adjusted a bunch of apple cider to get it up to lime acidity.  When I started brainstorming for this months competition, I got some malic and citric acids and have been acid adjusting different juices since then.  It's amazing.  


Background:  

Initial thoughts going into this were likely the typical place most of us started - apple pie.  But then I went to masala chai and thought about how to make a tea forward drink that incorporated apples.  I love the pile of spices in a proper masala chai, and I love spiced apple cider.   I started playing around with rum and apple cider and eventually moved toward a bigger tiki style rum drink which led me to this.  I was already getting close to zombie specs in terms of booze and volume of the drink and figured it was worth embracing it in the name as well.  Among my other hobbies I'm a big board game nerd, and while I've never played Zombicide, I certainly knew of its existence.  Zombicide: Black Plague made a nice linguistic transition to Zombicider (Black Tea) in my mind and things started clicking. 


Tasting notes:

Oh man, this is fantastic.  It is redolent with the flavors of fall, but without tasting gimmicky like a few pumps of some cloying syrup into a pumpkin spice disappointment at your local coffee chain.  The mint on the nose from the garnish is quickly pushed into the back by a bevy of clove, nutmeg, vanilla, apples, cinnamon, and allspice.  Initial flavors are the myriad of rum funks and warm spices, moving towards a bright acid note.  The acid adjusted cider brings that tartness you want from lime, but without the bright citrus tones.  Everything stays soft and sweet with slow earthy apple notes, a big blast of cinnamon and nutmeg followed by some subtle tea tannins.  The black tea is here and present but the cider is the star of the show.  The cream of coconut may seem amiss but it's bringing sweetness and a bit of creamy mouthfeel to the drink.  Hard to pick up on the coconut specifically, but it really integrates well without stealing the show.  This is dangerously drinkable.

We have just had a calm conversation, at first he was defensive and standing his ground but i said ""it seems like youre just scared to feel small because you have to apologise to someone smaller than you"" at which point it clicked. My son wasnt fully asleep yet so my partner went in to apologise, they had huge cuddles and my son asked if they can pkay the same game again tomorrow. 

One thing is for sure, im never coming to reddit for relationship advice again. Why is everyone so willing to just throw away years of great relationship over one incident where a conversation can help them realise where they went wrong. 

Granted if this conversation went differently, i wouldve asked him to leave. 

thank you to the people who actually contributed something other than ""Leave.""


Origional post:

MY (25F) partner (28M) was playing with my eldest son (6M), they were throwing soft toys at eachother, both enjoying the game. 
My son kept running around, hiding behind various pieces of furniture, when he chose to hide behind the coffee table. My partner pushed the coffee table with his foot and the corner hit my son on his head. My son is a very sensitive boy when it comes to pain so, as expected, began crying. 

I asked my partner to apologise, as thats what you do when you hurt someone by accident, im trying to teach my children this so setting a good example is the first step. Yet my partner refuses to apologise because they ""were playing and (my son) shouldnt have been behind the table"". 

I didnt want this to escalate so i walked off to start bedtime with my son, but my partner kept on ranting about his refusal to apologise. So i turned around and said in a raised voice ""youre worse than a child if you cant even own up to a mistake and apologise"".

Im now sat upstairs with my sleeping children while my partner keeps texting asking if im coming downstairs or staying in a huff. AITAH? ",78,1761337732.0,AITAH,122,0.9,False

According to Yelp’s latest “Top 100 Coffee Shops” list, Yaw Farm Coffee Roaster ranked #1 in the U.S., earning an incredible 96% five-star rating.","Move over Seattle, Las Vegas just took the top spot for best coffee shop in the entire country.



According to Yelp’s latest “Top 100 Coffee Shops” list, Yaw Farm Coffee Roaster ranked #1 in the U.S., earning an incredible 96% five-star rating.



Located near Angel Park, Yaw Farm is run by husband and wife duo Ian and Jillian, who focus on beans from small and micro-lot farms. Their famous Yawtte, a latte made with house-made syrups and oat milk, is a crowd favorite.



There’s no seating inside, so it’s strictly grab and go, but locals say that’s part of the charm. Reviewers rave about the welcoming atmosphere, the expert coffee talk, and small-batch syrups like the blackberry flavor that “tastes like real fruit.”



Yaw Farm has also topped Yelp’s “Top 25 Coffee Spots in the U.S.” and “Top Coffee Shops in the U.S. and Canada” lists in past years, so if you haven’t tried it yet, it might be time for a caffeine adventure.



What’s your favorite coffee shop in Vegas?

**The Regular Season Finale: Tune-Up in the Desert**

The playoffs await, but the work isn’t done yet.

After clinching their postseason spot with a gritty scoreless draw in North Carolina, Rhode Island FC now heads west for one last regular-season test under the desert lights of Albuquerque. The Tide make their first trip to the Land of Enchantment to face New Mexico United in a late-night duel that will decide whether they enter the playoff bracket as the **7th or 8th seed** in the Eastern Conference.

The stakes are clear: win and lock in the 7-seed, or risk a trip to league-leading Louisville. Either way, this match is about carrying the rhythm, belief, and momentum into what promises to be another thrilling October run.

And he, it's the final installment of **RIFC After Dark** (we've got to get this term to stick). So brew the coffee, light the candle, and let’s get wild.

**Where We Stand**

Rhode Island FC enter the final weekend of the season unbeaten in six straight (three wins, three draws) and peaking when it matters most. The Tide sit in seventh place with 38 points from 10 wins, 11 losses, and eight draws. The backline has been unbreakable, with back-to-back clean sheets and just 27 goals conceded all year, which is the third-best mark in the league.

Goalkeeper Koke Vegas continues to etch his name into club history, notching his 11th shutout of the season and 20th in an RIFC shirt. The defensive unit has featured a revolving cast throughout the year including Yao, Mabika, Nodarse, Stoneman, Bacharach, Rovira, Hope-Gund, and more recently Diop. They have remained consistently resolute. In midfield, the return of Clay Holstad has helped steady the ship, combining with Shapiro-Thompson, Rodriguez, Herivaux, and Ybarra to keep the engine humming and the ball moving progressively with purpose.

Up front, JJ Williams and Noah Fuson remain poised to reignite the attack that dropped five goals on Tampa Bay just two weeks ago. The Tide are creating chances, playing with confidence, and showing the same balance and bite that carried them to the USL Final last fall.

With one more result, they can seal the number seven seed and a postseason trip to Charleston. Anything less, and a showdown with Louisville may await.

**Who We’re Facing**

New Mexico United close out their regular season at home, already locked into the number three seed in the Western Conference. They will finish third with 45 points from 13 wins, 10 losses, and 6 draws. The club boasts a 6–4–4 home record and enters the weekend as one of the hottest sides in the league, unbeaten in six and having lost just twice in their last nine matches.

Their games have been wild lately, including back-to-back 3–3 draws against Orange County and Oakland in which they both led and surrendered multiple goals. This is a team that can score with anyone, tallying 43 goals on the year, but it has struggled to protect leads, dropping 17 points from winning positions.

Veteran striker Greg Hurst leads the line with seven goals, joined by defender-turned-finisher Talen Maples, who has six and a knack for scoring on set pieces, including against RIFC last season. Mukwelle Akale provides creativity and leads the squad with six assists, while Gedion Zelalem and Sergio Rivas control the tempo in midfield.

Expect a fast, open match in thin air and a raucous atmosphere at Isotopes Park. It is one final tune-up before the postseason.

**Rhody Randoms**

* **RIFC’s last meeting** with New Mexico came on March 13, 2024, at Bryant, in the club’s inaugural match as a professional team. It ended in a thrilling 1–1 draw, capped by a dramatic late equalizer (glory to Mark Doyle) that saw many fans instantly catch a lifelong case of RIFC fever.
* The Tide’s **six-game unbeaten run** is their longest since the nine-match stretch that led to the 2024 USL Final.
* RIFC have recorded **12 clean sheets**, second-most in the USL Championship.
* **Koke Vegas** leads all USL goalkeepers (21+ starts) in fewest goals allowed (17).
* A **win or Detroit City loss** secures the **7-seed** and a playoff trip to **Charleston Battery (Nov 2 @ 2 PM).**
* A **loss combined with a Detroit City win** means the **8-seed** and a rematch with **Louisville City FC (Nov 1 @ 7 PM)**.

***Vibe Check***

*It’s the finale. One more night under the lights. One more chance to sharpen the edge before the real fight begins. From Pawtucket to Providence, from the Seekonk to the Sandia Mountains, Rhode Island is riding with you. The stage may be far from home, but the energy travels. The Tide are rolling west with belief, brotherhood, and unfinished business. Grab a few 5-Hour Energy nips, rally some friends, and get ready to stay up late. Let’s finish strong, ride this Tide, carry the wave into the playoffs, and keep this story alive. #UpTheTide #VamosRhodeIsland #NMvRI*

Here's the machine: [https://cornerbeyti.com/en/turkish-copper-sand-coffee-maker/p879462935](https://cornerbeyti.com/en/turkish-copper-sand-coffee-maker/p879462935)

I would love any advice on recipes/techniques! My manager was saying we'd use the our coffee grinder, but I don't think it will make a fine enough grind. I also am not sure how thick of a layer of sand to pour in the machine. The only info I found said between 0.5 and 1cm above the heating implement, but this seems too shallow.

Below is the recipe I found on [https://sakiproducts.com/blogs/turkish-coffee/turkish-coffee-on-sand?srsltid=AfmBOoovmpGurRfX5wKVyJQx6y2MXoUS9opRf0FBEGKDGjDAs8q6pp0E](https://sakiproducts.com/blogs/turkish-coffee/turkish-coffee-on-sand?srsltid=AfmBOoovmpGurRfX5wKVyJQx6y2MXoUS9opRf0FBEGKDGjDAs8q6pp0E)

Pour sand into the machine and heat to between 190-200C.

Once heated:

**Step 1**

Add cold water and sugar (if desired) into the cezve. 

**Step 2**

Gently place the cezve into the sand, making sure it’s stable.

**Step 3**

Add grounds to the cezve. Do not stir.

**Step 4**

Heat the cezve till the coffee nearly foams over, and remove from the sand. Allow to cool for a few seconds till the foam subsides. Repeat this process 2-3 times.

**Step 5**

Rest coffee for 30 seconds so the grounds settle. Gently pour coffee, keeping most grounds in the cezve. (Similar to decanting wine?)

Wondering which areas people would recommend that aren't too touristy/busy but still have a nice atmosphere with lots of locals out and about. I'm not sure if it's a good reference point, but we stayed in Gracia in Barcelona and loved it as there were lots of locals (we were there for a festival by accident and there were huge street parties with very few English speakers), great food, plazas and wine bars, also nice that it felt very safe and we didn't worry about pick-pockets. We've done a lot of travelling around Europe and always have a much better time when we have a more local experience - especially love spots where there's young people out for coffee/wine/food all the time. As far as things to do, we will do a lot of walking and finding nice parks, flea markets and hopefully some local markets/vintage shops/any arty areas are aways cool to check out.

We are new here and planning our very first trip to La Fortuna for January. Staying at the Casa Del Rio hotel! It is looking like a lot of people are ahead of the game on booking excursions, and tours so I figure we better get on it! I have a couple of questions. 

1. Will we need dinner reservations in town? We are big time foodies and we saw a video about the Sofas, particularly the one where you write your message on a board to display to future guests. Will be we able to walk in and have dinner or will we need to schedule something? 

2. how much of the tours can we do ourselves? For example we know we would like to see the waterfall, can we just take an uber and see that ourselves one morning? Will we need to do a tour to see the sloths? I know that things like river rafting and coffee tasting will likely need to be tours. But we like to avoid the large group cattle experience as much as possible! What things can we do without a tour bus in the equation? 

3. Is it feasible to spend all day at a hot spring? I see some of the nicer hot springs have day passes (we have interest in Tabacon) . Will we be likely to want to spend all day there or should we plan on half days for the springs? We only have 3 full days so I want to maximize and I’m unsure if we will be bored in a few hours or regret if I plan something for before/after same day. 

4. Our flight out of SJO is at 1:38pm. Is it possible to make that from our hotel same day or will we be better off staying one night in San Jose ahead of the flight? We are able to make the trip one night longer so there is no hurt in pushing it back, just wondering if San Jose/surrounding area is worth hanging out in for a day or if we will be tired and ready to head home! 

Thank you so very much for all the tips! I know that a lot of this information is out there and I have been looking as much as possible but planning a trip to somewhere so new is overwhelming so your kindness is appreciated!

1of87dg,https://i.redd.it/bkgpm6yia4xf1.png,A1 size Battlemap - WIP,"Had a go at making a battle map - mostly for Alpha Strike on hex maps.  

Sharing this here in case anyone else finds it useful. It's in A1 format and should be good to have it printed. Also no guarantees the grid is 100% accurate - but I did my best to measure it in publisher without actually printing it. NOTE: this is a tad smaller than 2 x standard mapsheets - I just wanted something convenient to print at a UK printshop that'd fit on a coffee table.

Please note I didn't number all the hexes. Might do so on another rainy evening.

Would love some feedback from some longer-term players. I knocked this up in an hour since my game got cancelled tonight, so decided to create some content instead. But that was a fun exercise - might do that again, and open to ideas.",20,1761336912.0,battletech,3,1.0,False
