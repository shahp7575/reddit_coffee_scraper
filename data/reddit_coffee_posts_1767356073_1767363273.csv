1q1zjap,https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/1q1zjap/using_like_in_german_like_in_english_in/,"Using ""like"" in German like in English in Conversation","Hallo Leute,

I am literally making coffee and woke up thinking in German, so I have to type this out before I forget. I had a question about how Germans replay conversations, the way Americans do when we use the word ""like"". Zum Beispiel: 'so I was like, ""ew that's gross"" and she was like ""I know right!?"" etc.

I had a conversation with my friend that went like this: 'I did Muay Thai for two years. It was brutal. Sometimes I'd come home with bruises and my mom would be like, ""omg do I have to take you to the hospital!?"" I was like, ""no!"" lol

Does German allow for this kind of informal storytelling/recall of events? How would I translate this in German?

1q1zgxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1q1zgxh/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1q1zg76,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q1zg76/what_sets_smart_plugs_apart_from_smart_bulbs/,What sets smart plugs apart from smart bulbs?,"Smart plugs and smart bulbs are both popular smart home devices, but they serve very different purposes. Understanding what sets them apart can help you decide which one fits your needs better.

**How They Work Differently**

Smart plugs turn any regular device into a smart device. You plug them into your wall outlet, then plug your appliance into the smart plug. This gives you remote control over anything from lamps to coffee makers. Smart bulbs, on the other hand, replace your regular light bulbs and only control lighting.

**Control and Flexibility**

Smart plugs offer much more flexibility. You can control multiple types of devices through one smart plug - fans, heaters, chargers, or even small appliances. Smart bulbs only control the light fixture they're screwed into. If you want to automate different devices around your home, [smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) give you way more options.

**Cost and Setup**

Smart plugs are usually cheaper than smart bulbs. A basic smart plug costs around $10-15, while quality smart bulbs often cost $15-30 each. Setting up smart plugs is also easier - just plug them in and connect to your phone app. Smart bulbs require you to unscrew old bulbs and install new ones.

**Energy Monitoring**

Many smart plugs come with energy monitoring features. This means you can track how much electricity your devices use. Smart bulbs don't typically offer this feature since they only control lighting.

**Scheduling and Automation**

Both devices let you set schedules, but smart plugs can automate more things. You can schedule your coffee maker to start brewing in the morning or turn off electronics automatically at bedtime. Smart bulbs only handle lighting schedules.

**Which Should You Choose?**

If you want to control various appliances and electronics, smart plugs are the better choice. They work with almost any device that plugs into the wall. Smart bulbs make sense if you only want to upgrade your lighting with features like dimming or color changes.

For most people starting with home automation, [smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) offer the best value. They're affordable, versatile, and can transform multiple devices in your home into smart devices without replacing anything permanently.

The main difference comes down to scope - smart plugs control any plugged-in device, while smart bulbs only handle lighting. Choose based on what you want to automate in your home.",1,1767362714.0,ProductNew,0,1.0,False

After a lot of reading and watching videos, I finally put together my own small pour-over setup. It’s nothing fancy compared to some of the beautiful stations here, but it feels like a little “slow down and breathe” corner for me and I’m really looking forward to learning one cup at a time.

My setup:

1. Grinder: Timemore Chestnut S3

2. Dripper: Timemore B75 (wave filters)

3. Drip tool: Timemore Drip Assist

4. Scale: Timemore Black Mirror

5. Kettle: Time more electric gooseneck (temp control)

6. Servers: Timemore Glass Server | Akebono Stron 400 Black

7. A few small tools (scoop/brush)

1q1zfjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/9Barista/comments/1q1zfjv/a_new_thing_to_check_if_water_is_boiling_out_of/,A new thing to check if water is boiling out of the chimney,"Owner and daily user of a 9Barista Mk1 since Feb 2022 here. Like many people, I've had issues with water boiling out of the chimney on occasion. The cause of this was always either (1) accidentally putting too much water in the boiler, or (2) the boiler O-ring had worn out, usually after about a year. 

The reason these are the two causes is that the design of the 9Barista is such that the water in the boiler has only two ways to get out — out through the valve and the coffee to make espresso, or around the boiler O-ring, which goes into the middle section, and then boils out of the chimney. That's why a worn boiler O-ring will cause the boiling out of the chimney to happen.

I was having this issue again, and it had been about a year, so I replaced the O-ring. To my surprise, I was still having water boiling out of the chimney, and was puzzled, as I knew that the amount of water I was using was correct, and the O-ring was brand new. 

I found a new cause for the water boiling out. I was used to screwing the middle section onto the boiler really tight by maxxing out how much I was threading the two pieces together. I could tell that this affected my 9Barista, as the position of the handle on the middle section relative to the safety valve on the boiler has changed over the years.

I backed off on tightening the two sections a little bit, less than 1/8 of a turn, and my boiling issue went away.

What I think is happening is that by overtightening the middle section onto the boiler, it caused enough compression and deformation of the boiler O-ring that it didn't make a tight seal anymore. By backing off a little bit, the O-ring was able to do its job.

The key to lasting change lies in understanding the **be-do-have framework** and working with your natural emotional rhythms rather than against them.

# The Be-Do-Have Framework

Traditional thinking suggests you must do everything first (make money, get in shape, study) to have what you want, and then become who you want to be. This approach works backwards.

**The Correct Sequence**

* **Be**: Become her mentally and energetically first by thinking like her, feeling like you already are her, and adopting her traits and qualities.
* **Do**: Act like her by making decisions as she would, speaking like her, taking on her hobbies, and treating yourself and others as she does.
* **Have**: You will naturally have what she has because your thoughts and actions define your reality.

# Understanding Your Emotional Seasons

Your life moves through four distinct emotional seasons that follow your nervous system and emotional bandwidth.

* **Stillness**: You need reflection, clarity, and slowing down.
* **Becoming**: You experiment with new habits, reset routines, and test different approaches.
* **Expansion**: Your energy peaks and everything you do compounds rapidly.
* **Integration**: You stabilize, refine, and maintain what you've built.

# Stillness Phase: Design Your Future Self

**Define Your Future Identity**

* Describe the woman you're becoming aesthetically and emotionally.
* Determine how she walks, handles stress, and who she surrounds herself with.
* Identify what her life feels like on a daily basis.

**Uncover Your Real Motivations**

* Focus on why you want something rather than just what you want.
* Get ruthlessly honest about your true motivations, even the ones you're scared to admit publicly.
* Recognize that without understanding your real why, you will self-sabotage even when you achieve your goals.

**Create Your Action Plan**

* Define your big yearly goals and break them into four quarterly sprints using the **12-week year method**.
* Assign one smaller incremental goal per quarter that supports your big goal.
* Identify one to three repeatable daily actions that move you toward each quarterly goal.

# Becoming Phase: Build Through Micro Habits

* Focus on becoming 1% better every single day rather than attempting dramatic overnight transformations.
* Start with tiny micro habits like a 15-minute daily walk, cutting sugar from one beverage, or drinking water before coffee.
* Recognize that these small choices act as launch pads to bigger changes and reshape your identity through consistent different choices.

# Expansion Phase: Reinforce Your Progress

**Reward Your Wins Strategically**

* Your brain responds to pleasure, not pressure, so use positive reinforcement to incentivize continued progress.
* Choose rewards that genuinely feel enjoyable and don't create additional work for yourself.
* Stack dopamine boosts by tying rewards to the habits you're developing (new workout clothes after consistent gym attendance, a treat after completing wellness goals).

# Integration Phase: Make Good Habits Easier

* Reframe discipline as creating a life where good habits feel easier to do than bad ones.
* Design your environment and routines to support your desired behaviors naturally (sleep earlier to make waking early effortless).
* Add enjoyable elements to challenging habits (attend gym classes with friends, use amenities you love) to create built-in incentives.

# Stop Interrupting Your Transformation

* Constantly reinventing yourself is a survival response that creates the illusion of progress without actual change.
* After choosing who you want to be, simply be her and let the identity settle.
* Give your habits time to mature and your nervous system time to catch up to your vision through stability and repetition.

Like i wrote i am a new Rider.

Short information about myself :

Turning 40 this year.

I drove a Vespa (125qcm) for almost 2 years now and in the summer i did my license for ""big"" bikes.

Passed without problems (EU/Luxembourg).

I want to ride for fun/making trips with other people i do not want to set up a new record for the fastet Ride in 2026 ;)

I am middle aged and want to reach the age of retirement ;)

  
WHAT is a good beginner bike?

I know that is a meta question but let's say how many EUR would be a good ""starter capital""?

I looked at a lot of places where they sell bikes and the ""cheap"" ones are always a little older without ABS. Problem is i learned in driving school with ABS and never drove without it (except for car).

So i am not sure if that would be good for me?

How much would you say is a good budget when a friend would ask you for your opinion?

Thank you very much.

  
P.S I don't want to drive offroad. i like trips like Luxembourg-France/Germany etc stopping every XY KM, have a coffee, see the city etc ;)

My mom and I moved to a tiny town in the U.S.—the kind of place you barely notice unless you’re passing through.

The school felt empty. Too quiet.
Old lockers, dim lights, long hallways that stretched farther than they should.

I ended up sitting with three other students: Jake, Emily, and Ryan.
We weren’t really friends. We just didn’t fit anywhere else.

A month after I transferred, I had a dream.

I was standing in one of the hallways.
Completely silent.
The lights flickered. At the very end of the hall was a white door.

It wasn’t there in real life.
I could hear… breathing.

I woke up, heart racing. I tried to shake it off.

The next day, Emily laughed nervously.
“I dreamed I was alone in the school hallway last night,” she said.

We joked. I smiled, pretending I wasn’t worried.

A week later, Jake said quietly,
“I dreamed about a door… a white door at the end of the hall. I couldn’t open it.”

Ryan’s face went pale.
“I… I saw it too,” he whispered.

From then on, the dreams weren’t random anymore.

Same hallway.
Same flickering lights.
Same white door.

The only difference was who was closer to it.

Then things from the dreams started appearing in real life.

Emily dreamed a window breaking at school.
The next day, the same window was shattered.

Jake dreamed he saw words carved somewhere.
The day after, we found them scratched into a bathroom wall:

HOLLOW CREEK – something old

We didn’t know what it meant.

Years ago, four students disappeared from this school.
No bodies. No clues. Nothing ever explained.

That night, the dream changed again.

The door was open.

Inside was a classroom I didn’t recognize.
Four chairs sat in a circle.
One of them was broken.

The first time I noticed it, Emily was sitting there.

A week later, she didn’t come to school anymore.
The office said she moved away.
But her bedroom light was still on at night.

Jake was next.
He stopped coming to class regularly.
He seemed… different.

Then Ryan finally whispered something I’ll never forget:
“Something’s wrong with this place. Something’s… waiting.”

We tried everything to stay awake.
Coffee, energy drinks, staring at the ceiling all night.
It didn’t matter.

The hallway started appearing while I was awake.
Just for a second.
A flicker of white at the end of a corridor.

The last time I saw the classroom, I was alone.
The four chairs were filled.
The faces… I recognized them from old photos.

They weren’t looking at me.

I don’t know why they were there.
I just knew something was waiting.

I found an old file once… a photo of the missing students.
And mine was there too.
I don’t know why. I don’t remember anything.

Tonight, I can feel it again.
The door is open.
I haven’t slept yet.

Fatally crashes when on battery power.","**TLDR - my laptop fatally crashes within a minute of booting when it's on battery. Plugged in, it's 100% rock solid. If it's a hardware issue, is it something worth sending back for repair? Any chance this is a known issue that's easy to fix and I'm just doing something wrong?**

I have a really nice 2023 Razer 14 that I'm overall really happy with (minus the limited battery life), Ryzen 9 8945HS, 4070, 96GB of RAM and a 2 TB SSD. It's always plugged in so I never noticed any issues. However, I've had to work out of a coffee shop on occasion and within the past couple of months discovered that it basically can't run on battery power anymore. The battery is charged 100%. I've gone so far as to completely ""reset"" the machine with a fresh Windows 11 install, etc. I see no device issues in windows. BIOS is the most recent version, etc.

* Does this sound like something that if I sent it back to Razer for repair could be done for a reasonable cost (<$500), or should I just EBay it for parts at this point.
* Any chance this is some known issue that has an easy software fix that I've totally missed?

From my Gemini history, this is the summary of what the error codes I received in the past seem to suggest:

# Event Timeline (All 3 Errors)

This new log provides the first step in the crash sequence. Here is the complete timeline of what happened in that single second:

1. **12:07:29 AM (Event 161,** `volmgr`\*\*)\*\*
   * The critical hardware error (the WHEA) occurs, and Windows *tries* to write a memory dump file (a crash report) to the hard drive.
   * This **fails**, likely because the hardware error was so severe (possibly related to the storage system or motherboard) that it couldn't even write the file.
2. **12:07:30 AM (Event 41,** `Kernel-Power`\*\*)\*\*
   * One second later, the system logs the BSOD itself (`Bugcheck 292` / `WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR`), which is the *reason* for the crash.
3. **\~12:13 AM (Event 6008,** `EventLog`\*\*)\*\*
   * After you restart the computer, Windows logs this event to say, ""The previous shutdown was unexpected.""

# What This Means

This combination of errors **strongly** points to a **severe, low-level hardware or firmware fault.**

The crash wasn't just a simple software bug; it was so abrupt that the system couldn't even perform its standard procedure of writing a crash report. This reinforces the previous conclusion: you should focus on checking for **BIOS/firmware updates** from Razer, **chipset drivers**, and monitoring for **overheating**.",1,1767362199.0,razer,1,1.0,False

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",0,1767362166.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

I think the level of foam that I have achieved is reasonable, but please let me know your opinions. I mixed the coffee in with the sugar before adding the cold water and slow slowly bringing it to the boil. Then I let it rise three times and then cool down a bit before I poured it which achieved a bit of foam.

Help.,"Me (32M) just met a beautiful woman (29) who is currently interested in me — it's the first time this has ever happened in my life. Most of the time it was me who had to try to flirt, and because I’m very introverted and not very socially comfortable, it usually didn’t lead anywhere.  
( so my last relationship date back to highschool )

But now it’s been already one month that she’s been writing to me, and we’ve been on several dates together: coffee, Christmas market, billiards, ice skating. And she hasn't fled and actually try to make time for me even with her unpredictable work schedule. She is very talkative and I love hearing her voice with her cute accent when she talks about her life.

Unfortunately I am extremely reserved and a bit of a shut-in. I didn’t have a job for 5 years (I have one now), and I spent most of my unemployed time playing games like WoW and FFXIV, so I didn’t really have an exciting or rich life. She told me semi-seriously that she is opening up quite a lot, but that I seem cold and a bit too reserved.

So I have two questions:

1. How can I appear warmer and talk more about myself when my life feels boring?
2. What kind of activities can we do together, especially in the evening (I live in Switzerland), as dates that are more than just going to a restaurant? I’m not very creative and “Netflix and chill” is impossible for both of us (we both have roommates in the same bedroom, we are both \* kind of broke\* we can both pay our bill and do inexpensive stuff and eat out but nothing fancy.)",0,1767362059.0,AskMenRelationships,0,0.5,False

Situation is, for the last 4 years, we have had birthdays and given gifts to each other and all. I’m not claiming I’m the best. But this dude, istg. The first year, Daniel gave me a mug, and a cheap tote bag which looks like a cheap free bag the stores give you. And the mug well it’s too big so whenever I make coffee, the water measurement is messed up.

I gave him a leather cross body bag he likes. He makes my blood pressure rise istg. Then the next year, he gave me a shirt. He paid for a cropped shirt I was getting and that was it. I got him an electronic, like a power bank of good quality which he needs and still uses to this day.

Third year, he gave me a crocheted bag which his aunt makes. Cause she sells those. In a shoe box which he apparently crafted, unicorns and rainbow colors, I was 21. Like, no shit Daniel. And he wanted praise for it. Saying he personally made it. I got him three 4 inches cakes, of different flavours, from the best pastry in town. And a small perfume bottle. And you can say, well then you should’ve gotten him something shit like he did to you. BUT OUR FAMILIES ARE LITERALLY FRIENDS. My parents and his are friends, he and I are friends, I’d not disrespect someone that way.

This year he got me a small, like literally small, bouquet and a cake. The cake was cheap, I know it’s disrespectful to say it to someone’s gift. But just how much do you gotta cut corners? He’s getting these for the sake that our families are friends. Bare minimum, below bare minimum. So the cake was inedible. The fondant sucked, I couldn’t even cut through it cause the cake inside was too hard. 😀

He does know how to spend, he does know which stores are good or not. He’s so disrespectful. I told my parents. And my MOTHER, when she saw him was like, “she’ll treat you to a meal on the other day” (because he didn’t came to my birthday) “you two have fun and go out to eat the other day, alright?” HOLY MOTHER OF GODS I SWEARRRR.

So now I have to treat this dude. Thanks, mother. And have to get a gift. But this year I’m petty. So I’m thinking I’ll get him a cheap t-shirt or smth. Or a plant that is high maintenance and unappealing so that he has to take care of it and have a burden. (Just like he is to me)

Give me more ideas if you guys have any, cause I am going to get really really petty this time.

Executives don’t need more theory. They need **perspective, reflection, and real conversation**. Here are some activities that actually work:

1. **Decision Labs** Bring one real, unresolved business decision to the table. Small groups work through it, then rotate. You learn how people think, communicate, and lead under ambiguity—fast.
2. **Role Reversal Sessions** Have leaders temporarily argue *against* their own positions or advocate for another function’s priorities. It builds empathy and exposes blind spots in a way slides never will.
3. **Silent Strategy Walks** Pair leaders up and send them on a walk with a prompt (e.g. “What’s one thing we’re avoiding?”). First 10 minutes silent. Then talk. It’s weird. It works.
4. **Customer or Frontline Immersion** Bring in a real customer story or frontline perspective—raw, unpolished, and honest. Nothing sharpens leadership like hearing the impact of decisions downstream.
5. **Post-Mortem From the Future** Pretend it’s two years from now and the company failed. Why? Leaders write independently, then compare notes. Patterns emerge. It’s uncomfortable—in a useful way.
6. **Personal Operating Manuals** Each leader shares how they work best, what stresses them out, and how to get the best out of them. High trust, low fluff.
7. **Unstructured Time (seriously)** Some of the best leadership growth happens over coffee, not a facilitation guide. Protect space for it.

Rule of thumb:  
If the activity creates honesty, reflection, or better decision-making, it’s leadership development. If it just looks good in photos, it’s not.",1,1767361758.0,boompop,0,1.0,False

To start, my mom and I have always had a rocky relationship. If someone pissed her off she was coming home and yelling at me about it. I thought that she was in a better place because she wasn’t just screaming at me all the time. It seemed her mental health was in a better place and she wasn’t unloading all her emotions on to me, even my brother (who has been very low contact with her for more than 10 years thought she was in a better place and had done some healing). Unfortunately I let my walls down and we became closer than we ever have been for the last two years.

My husband and I found out we were expecting and she was so excited, she helped when I was sick and would cook me meals. We talked extensively about my plans for labour and post partum. The plan was for her and my husband to be there for my labor and once the baby was born she would leave so we could have some time just me my husband and the baby. Then once I’m in the post partum room, she would come back. My mom was supposed to take off the first week of work after I had my baby to help. I started to notice at the end of my pregnancy things were changing, when talking about when I was going to have the baby she would say I under no circumstances was getting induced because she was and it was painful. She would talk about how much my dad pissed her off during labor and how she wanted nothing to do with him, how her mom was all she wanted during labor and post partum. I thought she was just sharing her experience.

Fast forward, I go into labour and my mom is there the whole time. Her car broke down as she was pulling into the parking lot and I told her if she needs to use our car it’s there. Thirty minutes after my daughter is born, the placenta is delivered, my dr is stitching me up and I’m feeling very overwhelmed with a room full of people. My husband can see this and asks me if I want him to ask my mom to leave, I tell my mom that I’m ready for her to go. She scoffs at me and go back to stroking my baby’s back while she’s on my chest. Im super anxious at this point because I don’t know how to ask her again without her berating me in front of all these people. A few minutes go by, she still hasn’t left, so my husband sternly tells her that she has to go as I previously asked. She yells at my husband about how her car broke down and her daughter just gave birth and she needs time, and they haven’t even weighed her grand daughter yet etc.. My OB obviously sees all this then tells her it’s time to go and she can bring my post partum supplies to my room, she storms out crying. I tell them to take my baby and weigh her so that I can tell my mom. She never comes back to the postpartum room and goes home. I call her the next morning to chat and show her the baby while my husband is gone to get me breakfast and she asks how long my husband is taking off. I tell her that he has 3 weeks off but can take 6 if I need him to. She asks me if he’s even going to be there or if he’s just going to go hunting the whole time. I told her that obviously he’s going to be there for me and the baby.

We are discharged the next day and before we’re even home I call her to come over. She comes over and snuggles the baby, when it’s time to change her my husband changes her bum and gets her dressed. He struggles a bit to get her dressed because he’s never even held a baby before her, so he’s afraid to break her. My husband goes to tend to our dogs and my mom is holding my daughter and says “he can’t take care of you and her, he can’t even get her dressed, you need me” I tell her that he’s learning, as am I and that he has been doing an excellent job taking care of us. She goes home and the next morning we have to return to the hospital for follow up labs. My baby’s bilirubin is dangerously high and we’re readmitted for light therapy. I was so emotional, being unable to hold my baby for more than 24 hours other than feeding her every 3 hours for 20-30 minutes. My mom stopped by the hospital to bring me a coffee and give me a hug while we were admitted.

The next afternoon we are discharged from the hospital, and it’s my birthday so I invite my mom, step dad and in laws over for dinner. My mom offers to bring the dinner and I accept. She comes over around 8pm with dinner, this is my step dad’s first time seeing the baby. I have previously discussed with my mom the rules I have for baby, wash your hands before holding and no kisses from anyone. I ask my step dad to wash his hand before I hand her to him and he looks at me with a very annoyed look and says “don’t worry I’m not going to break any of your stupid rules”, which hurt my feeling but I didn’t say anything in response to this. My mom holds the baby while I get plates and utensils ready, I dish up a plate and grab my baby and sit down to eat. My mom says “I’m going to grab her while you eat” I said “it’s okay I want to hold her”. I had just gone more than 24 hours with her in an incubator, I wanted to hold her. My mom was super annoyed by this but doesn’t say anything. For the next 2 days we have to go to the hospital everyday for repeat blood draws and the third day we have a drs appointment. We live an hour out of town so these appointments take all day with a baby.

On Halloween by daughter is 10 days old, we go “trick or treating” at the grandparents houses. She was super fussy so I left her in the carrier, my mom tried to take her out of the carrier 4 times before we left, despite me repeatedly telling her to leave her in the carrier. A couple days later we go over for dinner, we get there and I hand the baby to my mom. She’s sitting on a bar height stool with her feet on a bar height counter and rests my daughter on her legs so she can take pictures of her, this stresses me out but I don’t say anything. My daughter starts to chew on her hands and show hunger cues so I say “she’s hungry I’m going to feed her” my mom gets annoyed and says she’s not hungry yet, I tell her yes she is and I grab her. I am in the middle of changing her before she eats and my mom comes over and says “let me change her I haven’t done it yet” at this point I already have the old diaper off, bum cream on, and I’m putting on the new diaper. I tell her I’m almost done anyways. I feed her and we sit down for dinner.

After dinner she starts to get fussy so my husband grabs her while the rest of us finish eating. I tell them that she’s starting to cluster feed and we should get going soon. My husband is trying to calm her down and my mom walks up and tries to grab her from him. He says just give me a minute, because he wants to calm her down first. My mom bursts into tears and storms out of the room, my step dad starts yelling at me and says “what is wrong with you, you don’t let anyone hold your kid, you’re horrible for what you’re doing to your mother” I pack up my baby, give them both a hug and I leave. I don’t talk to my mom for another week.

The first day my husband goes back to work my mom texts me to come over. She comes over and starts by says “so what’s going on with you” and the proceeds to yell at me for 15 minutes about how she was mad she was asked to leave the delivery room and how she was supposed to take the first week of her life off but I never gave her a definite answer, and that she feels I haven’t let her hold the baby enough. I tried to calmly (because my daughter was in a carrier on my chest and I didn’t want to yell and cry) explain to her that she disrespected my boundary by refusing to leave and I won’t accept her speaking poorly about my husband. I didn’t give her a definite answer about taking off the first week because we were in and out of the hospital the whole first week. I wasn’t letting anyone hold the baby for hours on end at the beginning because it heightened my anxiety, and her disrespecting my boundaries already was making my anxiety worse about her holding my baby. She screamed at me that I need to go back on my meds (my anxiety meds that I have been off for two years, I had seen my psychiatrist the day before and she said that she saw no reason to re start them).

After this she sent me a series of long winded text messages about how I’ve done nothing but disrespect her, she’s extremely disappointed in me, she’s done so much for me, she had a right to a relationship with my daughter even if I don’t like it, this is all happening because of my husband and I have no say in what’s happening because he’s controlling me and many many more things.

**The Problem:** I wanted a self-hosted AI Gateway to manage my API keys and routes, but everything out there requires Docker, Redis, or a heavy VPS. I just wanted something I could drop onto my cheap cPanel hosting or a Raspberry Pi.

**The Solution:** Meet **SmolOrchestrator**. It’s a lightweight, ""drag-and-drop"" AI Gateway that creates a unified, OpenAI-compatible API for all your models.

**Why use it?**

* **💸 Runs on Potato:** Works on $2/mo shared hosting. If you have PHP 8.2 and SQLite, you’re good.
* **🛡️ Control:** Issue granular API keys with strict quotas (e.g., ""Give this provider 2000 RPD"").
* **⚡ Smart Routing:** Set fallbacks (if OpenRouter is down, switch to Backup) and load balancing.
* **🔌 OpenAI Compatible:** Works natively with any provider that supports the OpenAI API spec (OpenRouter, Google Gemini, Groq, Nvidia NIM, etc.).
* **🔌 VS Compatible:** Works with RooCode, Cline etc as OpenAI API Compatible provider.
* **🎨 Cyber-Terminal-UI:** because admin panels shouldn't be boring.

**Tech Stack:**

* Native PHP 8.2+ (No frameworks, pure speed)
* SQLite 3 (Zero config)
* TailwindCSS (Frontend)

What is it that gnaws at my throat, begging for escape?
What burns the folds of my soul, and whose fire is extinguished only by the coolness of confession?
What is it that screams, waiting for a gesture of attention to quell the flames of forgetfulness and the volcanoes of neglect?
Is it nostalgia for a time when every detail of our lives was not examined through the eyes of a ruthless observer, waiting for the slightest deviation from the lines of perfection?

Even sitting on the couch at home is now infiltrated by the pressure of performance. Life, in most of its details, has become a spectacle—one that weighs the human being down with the illusion of an unattainable perfection. These unrealistic expectations of what an ordinary day in a person’s life should look like steal away a peace once felt when one did not care about the color or shape of the cup holding their morning coffee, when one paid no attention to the harmony of colors in their pajamas, when the beauty of every kitchen utensil did not matter.

A peace we once felt effortlessly—today we expend effort only to lose it. We lose the details of our daily lives. What used to exist without an audience now exists before an invisible one, casting light on all our failures, stealing from us the space to be ordinary, unremarkable, and comfortably average.
In this world, we no longer sit alone with ourselves; the phone has become the third presence in every gathering. And if that were the only issue, it would be tolerable—but the harsher truth is that this phone is a window opening onto thousands of external eyes and pointing fingers highlighting all your shortcomings, leaving you with the feeling that every effort you make is worthless, that you remain insufficient, incomplete, never enough.

I am speaking of the erosion of the feeling of enoughness—and this is the core of the modern psychological crisis.

I do not believe that humanity’s greatest achievements share a single form. They are personal, differing from one individual to another and from one set of circumstances to another. We must learn to trust our own personal evaluation more and loosen our grip on societal standards. I do not fundamentally disagree with Ibn Khaldun when he said that humans are social by nature, and I firmly believe that our self-assessment requires external eyes from society, as it is a mirror reflecting our existence. But society’s involvement in shaping the self has taken a pathological turn.

The balance we once lived with—before the age of the internet—has been hijacked by smartphones and social media. They have opened the gates for external judgment to seep into our inner shell. I do not reject society, nor do I call for romantic isolation; rather, I criticize excessive entanglement and call for the courage to rebel against standards that no longer serve us.

I’m not a coffee aficionado with high expectations, and I don’t have the bandwidth to do much more than what’s required by a drip machine, but over the past couple years all drip coffee has started to taste like burnt tires to me. I’ve tried several different machines and styles (drip, aeropress, moos pot, etc), a bunch of different brands of coffee, grinding my own beans vs buying ground coffee, all sorts of things, but I was beginning to despair that I’d never be able to have a good cup of coffee at home. 

I originally looked at a Nespresso machine, but the options (original line vs vertuo) combined with the variations in reviews were too much for me to wade through and feel confident, especially with the hefty price tag. I’ve always loved Lavazza coffee (memories from a special coffee shop in my old hometown) so when I saw they had a pod machine that also froths the milk for you, I was sold! I found it on sale through Amazon for $132, so I snagged it for myself for Christmas. 

I made a cappuccino first, it was great! It was so easy and fast, the milk frothed up like a dream, and it just felt so luxurious and cheerful to sip my cappuccino at home - so I made second drink, this time a macchiato, which was also just perfect to me. 

I really like that the Classy Plus can do drip coffee, espresso, and milk-based drinks (cappuccino, macchiato, latte) so I have lots of options. It’s relatively compact so it doesn’t take up a lot of room on the counter, it’s about as wide as a toaster; it is tall and the handle needs to be able to come up for the pod, so I’m going to need to do some rearranging to fit it in a spot that’s not under the kitchen cabinets. 

Again, I’m not a coffee expert, so I’m sure there are lots of people who would turn their noses up at this machine and the coffee it produces, but it is exactly what I’d hoped for when I set out to find a new machine! So if anybody out there has been wondering about this machine, I say go for it, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. Picture of my cute macchiato included. :)",1,1767360956.0,LavAzza,0,1.0,False

1q1yoqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1q1yoqw/i_dont_know_if_i_should_go_no_contact_or_just/,I don’t know if I should go no contact or just forgive and move on,"Sorry for the long post, trying to give as much context as possible but will never get it all.

To start, my mom and I have always had a rocky relationship. If someone pissed her off she was coming home and yelling at me about it. I thought that she was in a better place because she wasn’t just screaming at me all the time. It seemed her mental health was in a better place and she wasn’t unloading all her emotions on to me, even my brother (who has been very low contact with her for more than 10 years thought she was in a better place and had done some healing). Unfortunately I let my walls down and we became closer than we ever have been for the last two years.

My husband and I found out we were expecting and she was so excited, she helped when I was sick and would cook me meals. We talked extensively about my plans for labour and post partum. The plan was for her and my husband to be there for my labor and once the baby was born she would leave so we could have some time just me my husband and the baby. Then once I’m in the post partum room, she would come back. My mom was supposed to take off the first week of work after I had my baby to help. I started to notice at the end of my pregnancy things were changing, when talking about when I was going to have the baby she would say I under no circumstances was getting induced because she was and it was painful. She would talk about how much my dad pissed her off during labor and how she wanted nothing to do with him, how her mom was all she wanted during labor and post partum. I thought she was just sharing her experience.

Fast forward, I go into labour and my mom is there the whole time. Her car broke down as she was pulling into the parking lot and I told her if she needs to use our car it’s there. Thirty minutes after my daughter is born, the placenta is delivered, my dr is stitching me up and I’m feeling very overwhelmed with a room full of people. My husband can see this and asks me if I want him to ask my mom to leave, I tell my mom that I’m ready for her to go. She scoffs at me and go back to stroking my baby’s back while she’s on my chest. Im super anxious at this point because I don’t know how to ask her again without her berating me in front of all these people. A few minutes go by, she still hasn’t left, so my husband sternly tells her that she has to go as I previously asked. She yells at my husband about how her car broke down and her daughter just gave birth and she needs time, and they haven’t even weighed her grand daughter yet etc.. My OB obviously sees all this then tells her it’s time to go and she can bring my post partum supplies to my room, she storms out crying. I tell them to take my baby and weigh her so that I can tell my mom. She never comes back to the postpartum room and goes home. I call her the next morning to chat and show her the baby while my husband is gone to get me breakfast and she asks how long my husband is taking off. I tell her that he has 3 weeks off but can take 6 if I need him to. She asks me if he’s even going to be there or if he’s just going to go hunting the whole time. I told her that obviously he’s going to be there for me and the baby.

We are discharged the next day and before we’re even home I call her to come over. She comes over and snuggles the baby, when it’s time to change her my husband changes her bum and gets her dressed. He struggles a bit to get her dressed because he’s never even held a baby before her, so he’s afraid to break her. My husband goes to tend to our dogs and my mom is holding my daughter and says “he can’t take care of you and her, he can’t even get her dressed, you need me” I tell her that he’s learning, as am I and that he has been doing an excellent job taking care of us. She goes home and the next morning we have to return to the hospital for follow up labs. My baby’s bilirubin is dangerously high and we’re readmitted for light therapy. I was so emotional, being unable to hold my baby for more than 24 hours other than feeding her every 3 hours for 20-30 minutes. My mom stopped by the hospital to bring me a coffee and give me a hug while we were admitted.

The next afternoon we are discharged from the hospital, and it’s my birthday so I invite my mom, step dad and in laws over for dinner. My mom offers to bring the dinner and I accept. She comes over around 8pm with dinner, this is my step dad’s first time seeing the baby. I have previously discussed with my mom the rules I have for baby, wash your hands before holding and no kisses from anyone. I ask my step dad to wash his hand before I hand her to him and he looks at me with a very annoyed look and says “don’t worry I’m not going to break any of your stupid rules”, which hurt my feeling but I didn’t say anything in response to this. My mom holds the baby while I get plates and utensils ready, I dish up a plate and grab my baby and sit down to eat. My mom says “I’m going to grab her while you eat” I said “it’s okay I want to hold her”. I had just gone more than 24 hours with her in an incubator, I wanted to hold her. My mom was super annoyed by this but doesn’t say anything. For the next 2 days we have to go to the hospital everyday for repeat blood draws and the third day we have a drs appointment. We live an hour out of town so these appointments take all day with a baby.

On Halloween by daughter is 10 days old, we go “trick or treating” at the grandparents houses. She was super fussy so I left her in the carrier, my mom tried to take her out of the carrier 4 times before we left, despite me repeatedly telling her to leave her in the carrier. A couple days later we go over for dinner, we get there and I hand the baby to my mom. She’s sitting on a bar height stool with her feet on a bar height counter and rests my daughter on her legs so she can take pictures of her, this stresses me out but I don’t say anything. My daughter starts to chew on her hands and show hunger cues so I say “she’s hungry I’m going to feed her” my mom gets annoyed and says she’s not hungry yet, I tell her yes she is and I grab her. I am in the middle of changing her before she eats and my mom comes over and says “let me change her I haven’t done it yet” at this point I already have the old diaper off, bum cream on, and I’m putting on the new diaper. I tell her I’m almost done anyways. I feed her and we sit down for dinner.

After dinner she starts to get fussy so my husband grabs her while the rest of us finish eating. I tell them that she’s starting to cluster feed and we should get going soon. My husband is trying to calm her down and my mom walks up and tries to grab her from him. He says just give me a minute, because he wants to calm her down first. My mom bursts into tears and storms out of the room, my step dad starts yelling at me and says “what is wrong with you, you don’t let anyone hold your kid, you’re horrible for what you’re doing to your mother” I pack up my baby, give them both a hug and I leave. I don’t talk to my mom for another week.

The first day my husband goes back to work my mom texts me to come over. She comes over and starts by says “so what’s going on with you” and the proceeds to yell at me for 15 minutes about how she was mad she was asked to leave the delivery room and how she was supposed to take the first week of her life off but I never gave her a definite answer, and that she feels I haven’t let her hold the baby enough. I tried to calmly (because my daughter was in a carrier on my chest and I didn’t want to yell and cry) explain to her that she disrespected my boundary by refusing to leave and I won’t accept her speaking poorly about my husband. I didn’t give her a definite answer about taking off the first week because we were in and out of the hospital the whole first week. I wasn’t letting anyone hold the baby for hours on end at the beginning because it heightened my anxiety, and her disrespecting my boundaries already was making my anxiety worse about her holding my baby. She screamed at me that I need to go back on my meds (my anxiety meds that I have been off for two years, I had seen my psychiatrist the day before and she said that she saw no reason to re start them).

After this she sent me a series of long winded text messages about how I’ve done nothing but disrespect her, she’s extremely disappointed in me, she’s done so much for me, she had a right to a relationship with my daughter even if I don’t like it, this is all happening because of my husband and I have no say in what’s happening because he’s controlling me and many many more things. She’s now bringing other family members into it and trying to pin my the against me, even my brother who is low contact with her (which would never happen because we both know how she is, he also got a long winded text message at the same time as me about how he’s a disappointment too).

I'm here because I miss having someone I can talk to regularly. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, laugh a little, and slowly get to know without any pressure.

I'm calm by nature, but I enjoy depth. I like conversations that go beyond small talk, a bit of teasing, and that feeling when talking to someone just feels easy. I'm spiritual but not religious, and I enjoy thinking about life, people, and how we change over time. I believe connection should feel natural and safe, not rushed or forced.

I'm a good listener and I genuinely care when I talk to someone. Kindness, honesty, and communication matter to me. I'm not into games, ghosting, or drama. I like people who are warm, emotionally aware, and comfortable being themselves.

I enjoy simple comforts. The smell of fresh coffee in the morning, dark chocolate, instant noodles on lazy days, good music, and quiet evenings. Sometimes an occasional joint helps take the edge off everyday life and slow things down a bit.

I'm open minded about relationships and believe trust, consent, and respect matter more than labels. I'm hoping to meet a nice woman who enjoys talking, sharing thoughts, and building something slowly. Friendship first, connection next, and we see where it goes.

We started spending more time together. Coffee breaks turned into late nights at the office. Conversations lingered. She held my hand once when I was stressed, and I didn’t pull away.

1q1yf3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1q1yf3y/losing_a_friend_because_she_is_scared_ill_try_to/,"Losing a friend, because she is scared I'll try to pressure her into dating me","I'm a male and been friends with a female friend online since I was 16. I'm now 34 now.  
We were always really great friends, penpals, wrote to each other, and she always talked about the idea of us hanging out in person one day and how it was her idea of us being real life friends and she originally lived abroad, but now moved to my country a few hours away to study and even reached out to tell me she was coming here and that we could hang out and even asking me ""rent prices in your area?"" ""move into the flat across from me, as it's spooky here alone"" and showing me she wanted me to be part of this journey.  


I go in detail about this before anyone thinks that I am a pushy guy pressuring her into a real social life. It was her idea to hangout, and it just never ended up happening, but I wanted to keep that dream alive and not give up on it.  
  
She all of a sudden a few years ago, stuck me in this  ""don't get too close zone"". What I mean is,  she talks to me less now, maybe once every few months, briefly, instead of every day. She wont attend any events, wont meet up for coffee, wont do anything on our birthdays, including a webchat greeting, like we used to, or even accept/exchange gifts  
  
But she makes posts on her social media bragging about gifts male friends in her town or online sent to her. She allows them to do it. And when I was 20 mins from her on a trip recently, not even say hi as I passed through, but she'll do it with other male friends. And frequently meets guys off the internet who fly down to hangout with her. Just not me.  
  
Because she has me in this ""I don't wanna date him"" zone, and puts me in that zone out of fear that our hangouts will turn into me trying push her into being with me. And because she doesn't see me in that way, she just hides away and refuses to have a social life with me. Even though I don't see her like that, or made any such hint at it being like that. No flirt or anything, she was always more like a sister to me. She is just incapable of having a male friend that she doesn't find attractive. She only wants social life with potential guys who she has a crush on who could potentially turn into more.   
  
She is at the point where if she doesn't see you in that way, you wont even have a social life with her, like normal friends do. Basically, making the friendship pointless, summers, Christmasses, New Years, you name it, fun times roll by without doing anything, because this fear of it turning into more. So there's simply no friendship at all, but she'll go do it with guys she wants to be with, that social life time with them over months to see if it'll work out. She is so much in that ""test guys out to see if they are the right one"" mode, she forgets that having a male friend is possible too.. She recently posted photos of a guy from abroad from an online game, who she has known less time than me, who came to stay with her for Christmas.  


It's bizarre! I've lost a really great female friend over it. We used to bond and laugh so much, but she just suddenly changed. Possibly pushy guys in the past done this to her? But now I'm caught up in it. I couldn't even reach out to say ""Happy New Year"" out of fear she is gonna think I want something out of her or lustful. She's got me on egg shells. I wanna continue our friendship, but her putting me in this ""I don't wanna date him, therefore push him away as being a friend"" is a joke.   
  
She forgets a standard male friend exists too.. I have always valued her just a friend. I never even entertained the idea of it being more with her. She's ""one of the dudes"", to me, a tomboy, punk girl with a skinhead, who wears men's leather jackets. l that always felt she was more boyish in tone, and not something I'd ever ruin all our years of friendship over being silly and changing it into love. She has all of a sudden got this in her head. If she's in a relationship now, why push me out? Why can't she have a friend as well? It's like ""I've got a boyfriend now, I can't have a male friend as well, it will ruin it"". 

I keep beating myself up because I'm 5''2, balding and Autistic, with not very attractive face. Long story short, we became friends because of bonding over our ""outsider"" feeling as teens and the bullying we went through, so we always had that bond over our sadness. I keep thinking she ditched me and doesn't want to be my friend as she's deeming me ""Creepy looking bald Autistic dude gonna try hit on me, no way!"" and shut me out.. Maybe that's just my mind, but it keeps me awake at night when I see photos of her with handsome long hair heavy metal guys who flew 10000 of miles on a plane to hang out with her.

  
TLDR:  
Male has a female friend for over a decade. That friend has put him into a ""I don't wanna date him zone"" so they are unable to have a social life together out of fear that he'll turn it into love. He has no interest or any backlog of signs of being flirty, so it's out of the blue. She frequently hangs out with other male friends who she finds attractive, though. Originally, she came up with all the ideas of hanging out, it was never his idea, but he liked the idea, just so he can't be told he's pushy and pressuring her into hangouts. It was always her idea, and in the beginning, she was quite pushy to it, even asking if she could move to the same town as him.",1,1767359993.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Green initiatives and civic planning were front and center in Montclair throughout 2025. The township continued its push to be one of New Jersey’s most sustainable communities – earning **Silver certification** with Sustainable Jersey and showing real progress on climate goals. On April 27th, Montclair hosted a hugely successful **Earth Day “Earth Fest 2025”** in Crane Park, with educational games, eco-friendly vendors, and kids learning about composting and pollinator gardens[montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Government/Departments/Office-of-Sustainability#:~:text=EARTH%20FEST%202025%20Sunday%2C%20April,friendly%20alternatives%20they%20can%20demo). Residents of all ages turned out to pedal the smoothie bike (make your own smoothie with leg power!), sample plant-based treats, and pick up free tree seedlings. The Office of Sustainability gave away **Earth Machine composters** at a discount to encourage more backyard composting[montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Government/Departments/Office-of-Sustainability#:~:text=and%20where%20they%20could%20be,Learn%20more%20here) – and rumor has it dozens of Montclair gardens are now enjoying that “black gold” soil from kitchen scraps. **Adopt-a-Drain** also launched this year: over 100 eco-conscious neighbors have “adopted” a local storm drain to keep clear of litter and leaves, reducing flooding and protecting our waterways[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ9v-xXj80e/#:~:text=Montclair%27s%20Office%20of%20Sustainability%20has,times%20a%20year%20%E2%80%93). (Each participant even got to *name* their drain with a quirky moniker – we have Drainy McDrainFace out there, naturally.)

On the civic planning front, **affordable housing** was a big focus. Montclair’s Planning Board adopted the township’s **Housing Element and Fair Share Plan for 2025–2035** by the state deadline[patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-planning-board-tweaks-affordable-housing-blueprint#:~:text=The%20board%20previously%20voted%20in,Community%20Affairs%20was%20June%2030). This comprehensive blueprint identifies sites and strategies to add much-needed affordable units over the next decade[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,and%20inclusive%20oak%20forest%2C%20with). It even suggests repurposing some municipal properties (like an unused lot on Wildwood Ave) for housing, and encourages developers to include affordable set-asides. The initial draft drew some controversy – it had referenced the possible redevelopment of Martin’s funeral home, the town’s only African American-owned funeral parlor, which led to public pushback and that item being removed in the final plan[patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-planning-board-tweaks-affordable-housing-blueprint#:~:text=MONTCLAIR%2C%20NJ%20%E2%80%94%20Some%20tweaks,owned%20funeral%20home). In July, the Board approved the tweaked plan, sending it off to the state with hopes of compliance and funding support. Officials noted Montclair holds about $2 million in its affordable housing trust fund (possibly growing to $5M in coming years) to help bankroll projects[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=roadmap%20to%20ensure%20Montclair%20remains,find%20a%20cozy%20Montclair%20nest)[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=impacts%2C%20officials%20noted%20the%20town,find%20a%20cozy%20Montclair%20nest). It’s essentially a roadmap to ensure Montclair remains an inclusive oak forest with **nests for all critters** – keeping our community diverse even as housing costs climb.

Montclair also tackled other civic issues with vigor. Early in the year, the Township Council completed its national search for a new **Township Manager**, appointing **Stephen D. Marks** in February. Marks, who had been Kearny’s long-time business administrator, began his role on April 1st[theobserver.com](https://www.theobserver.com/2025/02/25/stephen-marks-appointed-town-manager-of-montclair/#:~:text=Kearny%20Business%20Administrator%20Stephen%20Marks,of%20Montclair%20announced%20this%20evening). After a period of interim leadership and some governmental tumult in 2023, having a permanent manager in place was a relief – the Mayor and Council gave him a warm welcome, and he hit the ground running on the 2025 municipal budget and personnel matters. (Fun fact: Marks said he was drawn to Montclair for its “civic energy” and immediately joined a Montclair softball league to get to know folks.) Under his watch, the **2025 municipal budget** came in with a modest tax increase (to maintain services) but also some belt-tightening to offset the school district’s tax impact. The Council approved the budget over the summer, emphasizing investments in road paving, park improvements, and a new ambulance for Montclair EMS.

Sustainability remained a guiding principle in civic decisions. Montclair’s new **Climate Action Plan (CAP)**, developed in 2024, started bearing fruit: the township expanded its residential energy efficiency outreach in partnership with PSE&G. By mid-October, **140 Montclair homes had signed up for free energy audits or info on rebates** for insulation, HVAC upgrades, etc.[sustainablejersey.com](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:~:text=sustainability%20and%20energy). The **Montclair Energy Saver** campaign (perhaps you saw the green yard signs) was a hit, showing that direct community outreach – including interns going door-to-door and booths at the farmers’ market – can drive real action[sustainablejersey.com](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:~:text=Interns%20from%20the%20PSEG%20Institute,at%20the%20Montclair%20Farmers%E2%80%99%20Market)[sustainablejersey.com](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:~:text=sustainability%20and%20energy). The result? Many families are now lowering bills and shrinking their carbon footprints. Montclair also introduced a “**Skip the Stuff**” ordinance for local restaurants, banning plastic utensils/straws in takeout unless requested (aligning with state law)[montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Government/Departments/Office-of-Sustainability#:~:text=,150). And the town began phasing in electric leaf blowers for municipal crews, while heavily restricting noisy gas blowers for landscapers (music to many remote workers’ ears). Our **Shade Tree Commission** planted over 200 new street trees this year, too, continuing Montclair’s legacy as the “Township of Trees.”

In civic engagement, residents stayed involved: Council meetings were well-attended (some would say *spirited*at times, especially on topics like towing contracts or outdoor dining rules). Montclair’s new **Civil Rights Commission** launched listening sessions on issues of bias and inclusion. And the Rent Control Board oversaw the second year of Montclair’s rent control ordinance, which caps most annual increases at 4% (2.5% for seniors)[montclair.hosted.civiclive.com](https://montclair.hosted.civiclive.com/government/rent_control#:~:text=RENT%20CONTROL%20,as%20of%20May%209%2C%202022) – a policy providing relief to many renters in town, even as landlords adjust to the rules. There’s still debate swirling around rent control’s long-term impact, but for now it’s part of Montclair’s effort to keep housing attainable.

All told, 2025 was a year of **green shoots and good governance** in Montclair. Challenges like infrastructure upgrades and affordability persist, but the township has plans in motion and engaged citizens pushing them forward. As we gather our acorns and plan for winter, Montclair’s civic and green outlook seems ever more sustainable – truly **democracy in action beneath the oak branches**.

# SQRL – Community Engagement Acorns 🐿️🤝

Montclair’s heart has always been its people, and 2025 showcased **community engagement** at its finest. Neighbors helping neighbors, volunteers stepping up, local organizations driving change – our town’s “squirrels” were busy in the best way.

One shining example: **Toni’s Kitchen**, the Montclair soup kitchen and food pantry, saw *record demand* this year as food insecurity grew. By summer, Toni’s reported a **sharp increase in families seeking assistance**(inflation and high housing costs left many cupboards bare)[toniskitchen.org](https://toniskitchen.org/summer-love-is-underway-at-tonis-kitchen/#:~:text=We%20know%20the%20need%20will,Summer%20Love%20means). But Montclair answered the call with overwhelming generosity. The **Summer Love campaign** at Toni’s Kitchen, aiming to feed kids who lost access to school meals during break, raised funds and food to bridge the gap[toniskitchen.org](https://toniskitchen.org/summer-love-is-underway-at-tonis-kitchen/#:~:text=During%20the%20summer%2C%20Toni%27s%20Kitchen,it%20difficult%20to%20afford%20groceries)[toniskitchen.org](https://toniskitchen.org/summer-love-is-underway-at-tonis-kitchen/#:~:text=We%20know%20the%20need%20will,Summer%20Love%20means). Volunteers – from home nurses to teachers to shop owners – helped prepare and deliver thousands of meals. Toni’s also expanded “Toni’s Closet,” its free clothing boutique, with a newly added room built by a local Eagle Scout[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/tonis-closet-eagle-scout-project-montclair-nj/#:~:text=The%20New%20Room). This flexible new space at St. Luke’s Church allows Toni’s to stock more clothing for neighbors in need, in a dignified setting. Truly, **Toni’s Kitchen is “more than soup,”** and in 2025 it lived up to that slogan more than ever. For their tireless work fighting hunger and poverty, Toni’s and its army of volunteers deserve all the acorns (and maybe a *Golden* one… stay tuned!).

Montclair’s charitable spirit didn’t stop there. The **Montclair Foundation** – our local community foundation based at Van Vleck House – had a banner year of giving. Thanks to a successful capital campaign, the Foundation **awarded $90,000 in grants to 17 nonprofits** in its Spring 2025 cycle[cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-spring-2025-community-grants#:~:text=The%20Montclair%20Foundation%20is%20proud,strengthening%20the%20greater%20Montclair%20community), a larger sum than usual. These grants supported everything from education programs to senior services and the arts[cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-spring-2025-community-grants#:~:text=grants%20will%20support%20critical%20initiatives,strengthening%20the%20greater%20Montclair%20community). For example, Succeed2gether’s after-school tutoring, the Montclair Neighborhood Development Corp’s youth jobs initiative, and Jazz House Kids all received funding boosts. The Foundation’s chair noted this *“exciting new chapter of expanded community investment”* was only possible because **Montclair’s donors opened their wallets generously**[cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-spring-2025-community-grants#:~:text=Thanks%20to%20the%20success%20of,chapter%20of%20expanded%20community%20investment). By fall, another slate of grants went out to nonprofits addressing mental health, homelessness, and more[cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-spring-2025-community-grants#:~:text=The%20Montclair%20Foundation%20Announces%20Fall,2025%20Community%20Grants). It’s a virtuous cycle: local generosity fueling local solutions.

We also saw grassroots aid when misfortune struck. In late July, a beloved local small business – **Ahava Felicidad Hair & Body studio** – suffered a devastating fire that destroyed most of the owner’s equipment and inventory[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-august-10-2025/#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%2C%20July%2029th%2C%20a,community%20has%20contributed%20about%20%244%2C600). Within days, Montclair residents organized a **GoFundMe drive** for owner Ahava Felicidad, aiming to raise $7,000 to help her rebuild. By mid-August, the fundraiser had collected about **$4,600** and climbing[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-august-10-2025/#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%2C%20July%2029th%2C%20a,community%20has%20contributed%20about%20%244%2C600), alongside donated supplies. The outpouring of support for a neighbor in need demonstrated once again that Montclair has each other’s backs. Ahava expressed deep gratitude and is determined to reopen better than ever, thanks to what she called *“my Montclair family.”* Consider this a **squirrel solidarity moment** – when one of us drops an acorn, others pick it up and carry it for a while.

In terms of civic engagement, Montclair residents stayed **involved and vocal**. Turnout was strong for events like the **4th Ward Community Fair**, where neighbors met with officials to discuss local issues from speeding cars to park clean-ups. The Montclair NAACP and local student groups held a forum on school equity, sparking ongoing collaboration with the Board of Ed. *Latinos of Montclair* not only launched that kids program but also organized Montclair’s first Latin Music Festival in September, drawing hundreds to the downtown for salsa dancing and cultural exchange. **Out Montclair**, beyond Pride, hosted year-round events for LGBTQ+ youth and seniors (including well-attended movie nights and a fabulous drag brunch that sold out). And Montclair’s many houses of worship continued their social justice and service projects – from interfaith food drives to hosting overnight shelter for unhoused neighbors in winter.

Perhaps the most adorably “Montclair” volunteer initiative was the **Adopt-a-Drain program** introduced by the Office of Sustainability. It engaged residents to literally adopt a storm drain on their block and keep it free of debris[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ9v-xXj80e/#:~:text=,times%20a%20year%20%E2%80%93). Over 100 folks signed up, and armed with gloves and bright blue “Adopt-a-Drain” t-shirts, they cleared leaves and trash before storms. This simple act prevents flooding and improves water quality – talk about *hyper-local* civic action! The program even encouraged friendly competition (the “Leaf-it to Me” team on Grove Street claims to have collected the biggest pile of gunk). It’s been such a hit that Montclair plans to continue it each fall and spring.

To cap the year, Montclair’s community gave back during the holidays in full force. The annual **Turkey Drive**led by Montclair Mutual Aid provided Thanksgiving meals to 300+ families. Toys for Tots drop-offs overflowed with donated gifts at firehouses. And the **Montclair Santa Visit** (organized by the PBA) delivered cheer – and presents – to dozens of children on Christmas Eve. Through every season, the refrain was clear: *Montclair cares*. The acorns of volunteerism, activism, and neighborly love are what truly sustain our town. In 2025, despite some challenges, Montclair’s community engagement was a bumper crop, reminding us that we’re strongest when we **work together**.

The Montclair Foundation’s record grant-making ( $90k in spring grants! ) provided critical funding to 30+ local organizations throughout the year[cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-spring-2025-community-grants#:~:text=The%20Montclair%20Foundation%20is%20proud,strengthening%20the%20greater%20Montclair%20community)[cnjg.org](https://www.cnjg.org/news/montclair-foundation-awards-90000-spring-2025-community-grants#:~:text=grants%20will%20support%20critical%20initiatives,strengthening%20the%20greater%20Montclair%20community). Together, these two exemplify Montclair’s generous spirit – turning acorns of charity into mighty oaks of impact.
* **Golden Acorn – Event of the Year:** *Montclair Jazz Festival 2025* – for **bringing world-class music and unity to our streets**. The Downtown Jamboree in September was arguably the biggest party Montclair has ever seen: 26,000 people of all ages and backgrounds, grooving together under sunny skies[montclairjazzfestival.org](https://www.montclairjazzfestival.org/become-a-vendor#:~:text=). Free, fun, and phenomenally run, this event showcased Montclair at its best – artsy, inclusive, and a little funky. Hats off to Jazz House Kids and all volunteers who made it possible. (Cue the trumpets and confetti cannons – this Golden Acorn’s for you! 🎺)
* **Golden Acorn – Youth Achievement:** *Montclair High Robotics Team 555* – for **STEM excellence on a regional stage**. Our high school “Mechanical Squirrels” engineered a stellar robot and took home awards for quality and creativity in FIRST competitions[montclairrobotics.org](https://www.montclairrobotics.org/#:~:text=FRC%20Team%20555%20%C2%B7%202025,Warren%20Hills%3B%20and%20Creativity). They also mentored middle schoolers and showed great sportsmanship. In a year when the school district had its woes, these students gave us something to brag about and hope for. A Golden Acorn for the next generation of innovators – may your future be full of code and **no** bugs!
* **Golden Acorn – Public Service:** *Mikie Sherrill (Montclair’s own)* – for **her historic election as New Jersey’s Governor-Elect** and continued dedication to service[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Jersey_gubernatorial_election#:~:text=The%202025%20New%20Jersey%20gubernatorial,limited). A Montclair resident, Navy veteran, and congresswoman, Sherrill made us proud by winning the state’s top job in November with a landslide 14% margin[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Jersey_gubernatorial_election#:~:text=Following%20a%20string%20of%20strong,Sherrill%20was%20the%20first%20Democratic). She’ll be NJ’s second female governor ever and the first from Montclair. Mikie balanced representing us in D.C. while campaigning across NJ, all while remaining a down-to-earth neighbor. We bestow this Golden Acorn for leadership, breaking glass ceilings, and proving that Montclair’s acorns can grow into *Governor oaks*. 🌳

*(Honorable mentions:* Montclair Pride Organizers, for an incredible festival; Montclair Fire Department, for swift responses to everything from house fires to cats in trees; the volunteers of Adopt-a-Drain, for unsung but literally ground-level service).

# ⚠️ Rotten Acorn Alerts 2025 ⚠️

*(Not all acorns are golden – a few rot on the branch. Here are the year’s “Rotten Acorns,” the challenges and lowlights we faced.)*

* **Rotten Acorn – School Budget Meltdown:** The Montclair Public Schools’ surprise $20 million deficit was the major “yuck” of 2025[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,Reported). Accounting lapses and overspending led to emergency measures, leadership resignations, and potential tax hikes – leaving taxpayers and parents frustrated. It’s a moldy acorn we hope gets composted into lessons learned, fast.
* **Rotten Acorn – Commuter Chaos:** For the first time in 40 years, **NJ Transit’s locomotive engineers went on strike** in May, shutting down all Montclair-Boonton line trains for days[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20nj%20transit%20strike%20may,2025). Montclair commuters were stranded or forced onto crowded buses and PATH trains. Though the strike ended fairly quickly, it highlighted our transit fragility. A tough acorn to chew for the many who rely on rail service.
* **Rotten Acorn – Affordability Strain:** Montclair’s **housing affordability** continued to challenge us. Home prices remained sky-high – seven-figure listings became the norm[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=the%20season,buyers%20are%20still%20scurrying%20to), and rising interest rates didn’t bring relief so much as squeeze buyers further[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=listings%20like%20this%20showcase%20the,after%20real%20estate%20markets). Renters, too, faced steep rents (despite rent control for some). The town is taking steps (see housing plan), but in 2025 the dream of a “starter home” in Montclair felt like chasing a squirrel up a tall oak.
* **Rotten Acorn – Beloved Institutions Lost:** The closure of **Immaculate Conception High School** after a century was a sad moment[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna#:~:text=After%20100%20Years%20in%20Operation%2C,High%20School%20Closes%20in%20Montclair). Also, a couple of long-time local businesses quietly closed shop this year (including a family-owned bakery and a vintage shop), leaving empty storefronts and nostalgia behind. Each closing is a reminder to support the institutions we cherish *while we have them*. We pour one out (or rather, drop an acorn) in their memory.

*(Thankfully, even these rotten acorns can spur new growth: the school district is reforming its finance practices; NJ Transit and its union went back to bargaining to avoid future strikes; housing issues spurred more activism for affordability. Montclair is resilient – we compost the rot and grow anew.)*

# Nut Notes & Fun Stats 🥜📊

* **Acorn Index Highlights:** Started 2025 around **$1.12**, peaked at **$1.18** mid-summer[reletter.com](https://reletter.com/publications/james-publication-30#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20Index%20held%20around,and%20prudent%20fiscal%20steps), and ended about **$1.20** (estimated). Weekly fluctuations were usually <1%, showing a *steady, nutty* growth overall. Montclair’s local economy outpaced many peers – not bad for our tiny “Acorn currency”!
* **“Eggs Per Acorn” – Reverse Eggflation Edition:** At the worst of 2023, one Acorn (around $1.00 then) could barely buy a half-dozen eggs. By late 2025, one Acorn (\~$1.20) bought **a full dozen large eggs**, thanks to falling egg prices and our rising index – a 100%+ improvement in egg-buying power. We truly witnessed **reverse eggflation** in action[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1jzpfcu/acorn_economy_week_2/#:~:text=Acorn%20Economy%20,comes%20to%20a%20close). (Omelets for everyone!)
* **New Businesses Count:** **30+ new businesses** opened in Montclair/Essex in 2025[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=2025%20was%20a%20massive%20year,and%20Essex%20County%20in%202025), including **10+ new restaurants/cafés**, 3 new fitness studios, 2 new boutiques, and a brewery taproom. Notable: Montclair now has **at least 8 specialty coffee shops** (we’re buzzing!). Meanwhile, only a handful of closures were recorded. Net gain: Montclair’s commercial ecosystem grew like a well-watered oak.
* **Montclair Jazz Fest by the Numbers:** **26,000** attendees[montclairjazzfestival.org](https://www.montclairjazzfestival.org/become-a-vendor#:~:text=), **8 hours** of music, **3 stages**, **200+ artists/musicians**, **150 vendors**, **0** tickets needed (free!), **1** town united in swing. 🌟🎷
* **Montclair Pride by the Numbers:** **200+ vendors, 3 stages, 6 hours** of festivities[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L399%20The%204th,drink%20vendors%2C%20food%20trucks%2C%20LGBTQ), **1 awesome after-party**. And countless moments of joy and acceptance. 🏳️‍🌈
* **Volunteer Power:** Montclair officials estimate that over **15,000 volunteer hours** were logged by residents in 2025 for various causes – from PTA events to park cleanups. That’s equivalent to roughly 8 full-time people working year-round *for free* to make our town better. Give yourselves a hand, Montclair – that’s the **squirrel spirit**!
* **Tree Canopy:** \~**220 new public trees** planted (Street Tree Program + parks) vs. 40 removed (mostly dead/diseased). Net +180 trees – our urban forest is growing. One newly planted oak on Elm Street was ceremonially named “Jackson” after a retiring Montclair parks employee.
* **Compost & Waste:** Montclair’s composting program sold **50+ compost bins** to residents[montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Government/Departments/Office-of-Sustainability#:~:text=and%20where%20they%20could%20be,Learn%20more%20here), diverting an estimated **5 tons** of food waste from landfills. Curbside recycling tonnage was up 5%, trash tonnage down 3% – we’re trending greener!
* **Montclair in Media:** Montclair was mentioned or featured in **over 50 news articles** outside our local sphere this year. From Mikie Sherrill’s gubernatorial victory[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Jersey_gubernatorial_election#:~:text=The%202025%20New%20Jersey%20gubernatorial,limited), to a NY Times piece on our hot restaurant scene, to that Netflix filming at MHS – our little town made big headlines.

As we close the books on 2025, one thing is clear: Montclair’s “Acorn Economy” isn’t just dollars and cents – it’s the **social capital, culture, and community values** that enrich our lives. The Montclair Acorn Index measures some of it, but the anecdotes and people behind the numbers tell the full story. This year’s report showed a town that is **dynamic and compassionate**, where businesses flourish alongside volunteerism, and where even challenges are met with creativity and resolve.

Here’s to Montclair’s continued growth in 2026 – may our **acorns** be plentiful, our **squirrels** be resourceful, and our community spirit remain as mighty as a oak. 🍂 **Happy New Year, Montclair!** 🥂

**Greetings, Montclair neighbors!** Welcome to the **Montclair Acorn Economy 2025 Report**, a whimsical yet comprehensive roundup of our town’s year in business, community, and “nutty” local metrics. We’ll scurry through the **Acorn Index** timeline, dive into Montclair’s ETF-style sectors (from Health to Tech to Lifestyle), and pause for **Golden Acorn Awards** 🏆 and **Rotten Acorn Alerts** 🚨 along the way. By the end, you’ll see how Montclair’s squirrels (that’s all of us!) gathered acorns of progress through 2025 – **fun, smart, and true to Montclair’s character.** Let’s crack this nutshell of a year!

# Acorn Index 2025: Squirrel Stash Through the Seasons 🐿️📈

**Montclair’s Acorn Index**, our symbolic composite of local economic vibes, started the year strong around **$1.12**, reflecting post-holiday optimism. Despite winter chills, **local spending and savings held steady**, and by spring the index sprouted upward. A dose of “**reverse eggflation**” – falling grocery prices while local incomes rose – gave our Acorn extra buying power[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1jzpfcu/acorn_economy_week_2/#:~:text=Acorn%20Economy%20,comes%20to%20a%20close). In real terms, one Montclair “Acorn” fetched more eggs and bagels than before, as inflation fears cooled.

**Summer 2025** saw the index **climb to about $1.17**[reletter.com](https://reletter.com/publications/james-publication-30#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20Index%20held%20around,and%20prudent%20fiscal%20steps), riding a wave of new business openings, festivals, and robust community activity. This \~0.5% uptick from spring reflected **steady local growth**[reletter.com](https://reletter.com/publications/james-publication-30#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20Index%20held%20around,and%20prudent%20fiscal%20steps). The grand reopening of Lackawanna Plaza and a flurry of restaurant debuts infused economic acorns into our community, offsetting headwinds like higher interest rates. Even as national trends wobbled, Montclair’s diverse economy kept **squirreling away gains**.

After a brief autumn dip (blame school budget jitters and a nut-tightening by cautious consumers), the Acorn Index **finished the year near $1.20**. A late-year boost came from holiday shopping and dining – Montclair’s downtown was abuzz with residents supporting local shops and eateries. Overall, our **Acorn Index** ended about **7% higher** than a year ago, a sign that **Montclair’s local economy** remains resilient and **nutrient-rich**for businesses and families alike. In short, 2025 was a year of **modest, steady growth** in our oak tree’s shadow, with plenty of acorns stored for seasons ahead.

# ACH – Health & Wellness Acorns

Montclair’s community health saw **caution and care** in 2025. In spring, residents were alerted after a *measles exposure* was reported at Newark Airport (EWR), reminding commuters to check their vaccinations[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:~:text=,Spot%20Coming%20to%20Upper%20Montclair). Around the same time, agriculture officials detected **bird flu** at a live poultry market in Essex County[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:~:text=,in%20Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20General%20Store). Thankfully, no local outbreak followed these scares, but Montclair’s Health Department monitored the situation closely, ensuring our **nest remains safe**. By summer, health officials were also keeping an eye on hazy skies from Canadian wildfires, issuing advisories on air quality – a smoky reminder of climate’s impact on public health.

Bright spots shone as well. A new **art wellness center**, *Keep Creating Art*, relocated into a larger space at Lackawanna Plaza, expanding inclusive art therapy programs for all abilities[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:~:text=Keep%20Creating%20Art%20Wellness%20Center%2C,the%20cost%20of%20moving%2C%20renovating). This creative oasis offers classes that nourish mental health and community connection – truly **wellness outside the box** (of crayons). Montclair also saw growth in boutique fitness and holistic health services. From **Pilates studios** like women-only Pilatte (complete with a coffee/juice bar) opening in Upper Montclair[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,10%2C%20Montclair) to nutrition-focused cafes popping up, residents embraced a *“healthy acorn, healthy life”* philosophy.

In town government, Montclair’s Department of Health and Human Services continued outreach on everything from flu clinics to senior services. They promoted free **COVID-19 booster** pop-ups and heart health screenings at the YMCA. And remembering that *mental* health is health, local groups hosted workshops on stress relief and mindfulness. Montclair ended 2025 with **no major public health crises** and a renewed commitment to community well-being – a healthy harvest indeed.

# ACB – Local Business Acorns

**Downtown Bloom:** Montclair’s business district **burst with fresh energy** this year. The historic **Lackawanna Station redevelopment** officially opened as a new shopping and dining hub, welcoming over 20 new businesses under its restored 1913 roof[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,com). The grand opening in June featured live music, art, kids’ activities, and free samples – marking a major infusion of economic acorns into our community’s stash[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,com). Residents and visitors have been exploring the **food hall and marketplace**, where independent vendors now buzz in a space that sat empty for years. Montclair’s landmark train station has been reborn as a one-stop destination for artisanal eats, local crafts, and even a weekly farmer’s market vibe. It’s a *track* record we’re proud of!

**New Nuts in Town:** 2025 was a banner year for new businesses – over **30+ shops, cafes, and studios opened** in Montclair and nearby[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=2025%20was%20a%20massive%20year,and%20Essex%20County%20in%202025). On Bloomfield Avenue alone, the diversity is delicious. We got a taste of world-class fine dining when *Iron Chef* Masaharu **Morimoto** opened **“MM by Morimoto”** in July, an elegant Japanese restaurant with an omakase bar and sushi flown in from overseas[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,193%20Glenridge%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair). (It’s reservation-only and the talk of the town for date nights.) Right next door, Morimoto’s team also debuted **OEN**, a swanky cocktail lounge and 12-seat omakase speakeasy in October[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Avenue) – proving Montclair can attract culinary heavyweights.

*Montclair’s dining scene keeps growing – the interior of a new Bloomfield Avenue restaurant, Sam’s Table, which opened in fall 2025 with a vegetable-forward menu and chic decor. Local foodies are already flocking here for its seasonal small plates and modern vibe.* [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair)[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-august-10-2025/#:~:text=the%20Montclair%20news%20to%20keep,week%20ending%20August%2010th%2C%202025)

Meanwhile, homegrown entrepreneurs filled our town’s niches. **Mashed Burgers**, a New Jersey-based halal burger joint, flipped its first patties here in March – bringing smash burgers, shakes and fries to Bloomfield Ave for comfort-food lovers[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair). **El Gordo Peruvian Eatery**, a family-run restaurant, introduced bold Peruvian flavors (ceviche! lomo saltado!) to Orange Road after opening its Montclair outpost in March[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,324B%20Orange%20Road%2C%20Montclair). Coffee connoisseurs rejoiced as **Qahwah House** (brewing aromatic Yemeni coffee with cardamom and honeyed pastries) opened in February[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=around%20town%2C%20adding%20to%20Montclair%E2%80%99s,plus%20shakes), and **787 Coffee** brought Puerto Rican brews to town[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair). For those with a sweet tooth, Somedays Bakery began serving Parisian-style croissants on Bellevue Ave in June[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bellevue%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair). The Montclair Girl reports that from **bakeries and fine dining to fitness studios and boutiques, 2025’s newcomers truly ran the gamut**[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=2025%20was%20a%20massive%20year,and%20Essex%20County%20in%202025). It’s proof that Montclair’s acorn economy is **thriving one new business at a time**[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=themontclairgirl,new%20business%20at%20a%20time)!

**High Hopes & Green Shoots:** In a milestone for Montclair’s *budding* cannabis sector, **The Kush Connection**dispensary finally won Planning Board approval on June 30th[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,%E2%80%9Cbudding%E2%80%9D%20business%20open%20its%20doors). After a year of squirreling through red tape, this recreational cannabis shop will set up at 665 Bloomfield Avenue (a former auto dealership) with plans to open in 2026[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,Montclair%E2%80%99s%20enterprising%20squirrels). The approval – which came with lively debate about parking and signage – adds “green acorns” to our local economy. Enthusiastic support from residents (and a punny Planning Board hearing or two) indicates Montclair is ready to **embrace this new industry**[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=of%20chatter%20about%20parking%20and,acorns%E2%80%9D%20to%20the%20local%20economy). Elsewhere, the trend of mobile businesses rolled on: Woofie’s Pet Service launched a new mobile pet-grooming van at Montclair’s Pride Festival[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=The%20pet%20service%20company%20Woofie%E2%80%99s,new%20mobile%20van%2C%20which%20serves), bringing *on-demand* pampering to local pups. From tech-driven services to mom-and-pop shops, Montclair’s entrepreneurial spirit stayed **strong and diverse**.

It wasn’t all smooth sailing – a few beloved businesses did close or move. A century-old Catholic store shut its doors, and some pandemic-era pop-ups ended their runs. But overall, 2025’s business climate was **nutritious**. Montclair’s **office of Small Business Advocacy** helped new owners navigate permits, and the Shop Local campaigns during the holidays kept cash registers ringing. With a *dizzying array* of restaurants, cafés, retail boutiques (inclusive lingerie at **Greymade** opened in January[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=their%20travels%2C%20art%2C%20and%20their,backgrounds%20in%20television%20and%20movies)!), and wellness studios, Montclair’s local business sector felt like **a well-mixed trail mix** – a little of everything, and plenty to crunch on.

# ACT – Local Tech Acorns

Montclair might be known for arts and eats, but 2025 proved we’ve got **tech chops** in our tree, too. The town’s young innovators made us proud: **Montclair High School’s Robotics Team 555** had an award-winning season, clinching the Quality Award at the Mount Olive FRC competition and a Creativity Award at Warren Hills[montclairrobotics.org](https://www.montclairrobotics.org/#:~:text=FRC%20Team%20555%20%C2%B7%202025,Warren%20Hills%3B%20and%20Creativity). These budding engineers (90+ students strong) designed a robot named “Riptide” to compete in FIRST Robotics Challenge, showing that STEM is thriving in our schools. Their semi-finals run and trophy haul underscored Montclair’s reputation for **hands-on tech education**. Talk about *high-tech squirrels* – these students are the acorns that will grow into future engineers and coders.

Local entrepreneurs also blended tech with community needs. At Montclair’s Pride Festival in June, **Woofie’s Montclair** unveiled a high-tech mobile pet care van (essentially a pet spa on wheels) to serve busy owners[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=The%20pet%20service%20company%20Woofie%E2%80%99s,new%20mobile%20van%2C%20which%20serves). It was a hit, and signals how local services are embracing technology – from app-based booking to GPS-enabled mobile vans – to make life easier for residents and their furry friends. Montclair’s small businesses increasingly use e-commerce, delivery apps, and social media marketing as part of their toolkit, keeping our township **plugged into the digital economy**. Even the corner farmstand might take Apple Pay now – truly a *new breed* of convenience.

Meanwhile, Montclair welcomed a **global creative tech community** into its midst. This summer, the worldwide speaker series **CreativeMornings** launched its **first New Jersey chapter right here in Montclair**, hosting free monthly talks for local techies, designers, and innovators[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-august-10-2025/#:~:text=the%20Montclair%20news%20to%20keep,week%20ending%20August%2010th%2C%202025). Held at (where else?) Lackawanna Plaza’s new co-working space, these gatherings connect Montclair’s creative professionals with big ideas and each other. It’s like TED Talks meets networking over coffee, and it cements Montclair’s status as a **regional innovation hub** – no need to trek to Brooklyn or Silicon Alley when we have it in our backyard.

On the municipal side, Montclair continued upgrading its tech infrastructure. The township’s revamped website (launched late 2024) made it easier to pay taxes, report issues, and stream Council meetings online – no more buffering, hooray! And plans are afoot to pilot **smart parking meters** that accept contactless payments downtown. Montclair’s public library added more Wi-Fi hotspots for loan and hosted coding workshops for teens. In short, our community kept one foot in tradition and one in the future. By the end of 2025, Montclair’s local tech scene proved that even a **small town can think big** – whether it’s students building robots, or entrepreneurs coding the next startup in a Church Street café. The acorns of innovation are planted, and we’re excited to see them sprout.

# ACE – Education Acorns

**Classrooms, Changes & Celebrations:** Montclair’s education landscape saw big shifts in 2025. In June, the town bid a fond (and bittersweet) farewell to **Immaculate Conception High School**, which **closed its doors after 100 years** of educating Montclair’s youth[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna#:~:text=After%20100%20Years%20in%20Operation%2C,High%20School%20Closes%20in%20Montclair). Generations of alumni and faculty reflected on the legacy of ICHS – a cherished Catholic institution that shaped countless lives. As the Archdiocese made the difficult decision citing enrollment and financial challenges, the community honored Immaculate’s century of service at a final mass and reunion. It’s truly the end of an era on Cottage Place, and Montclair loses a little piece of its history with that blue-and-white Mustang mascot. *Good night, Immaculate,* and thank you for a century of acorns planted in young hearts.

In the public schools, **financial drama** took center stage. The Montclair School District uncovered a **$19.6 million budget shortfall** spanning last year and this year – a “surprise” deficit that had parents and officials scrambling[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,Reported)[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20may%20take%20a%20hybrid,the%20state%20to%20stay%20afloat). By October, Superintendent Dr. Ruth Turner and Interim Business Administrator Dana Sullivan held town hall meetings to explain the dire numbers. The debt forced some tough choices: Montclair sought an emergency infusion of $12+ million (one-time) and even floated a special referendum to raise taxes for another $7 million[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=Interim%20Business%20Administrator%20Dana%20Sullivan,would%20be%20a%20recurring%20expense). Voters braced for the possibility of a December tax increase vote – and state monitors looming if we took a loan[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=Two%20main%20paths%20forward%20were,presented). Emotions ran high as parents asked if sports or preschool might face cuts[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=The%20most%20moving%20moment%20came,be%20on%20the%20chopping%20block)[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,licenses%20and%20returning%20to%20textbooks). In the end, the Board of Education pursued a hybrid solution of state help and taxpayer support to fill the gap. The crisis did claim one casualty: the **district’s Business Administrator resigned** effective July 1, after a series of unpaid bills and late notices came to light[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20School%20Business%20Administrator%20Resigns%2C,Effective%207%2F1). By year’s end, Montclair’s schools were under closer scrutiny and an independent forensic audit was underway to ensure this *nutty fiasco* never repeats. It was a teachable moment in fiscal accountability (and perhaps a cautionary tale about not hiding acorns for too long!).

On a brighter note, Montclair’s students and teachers achieved plenty to celebrate. Aside from robotics victories, our **high school’s drama club** clinched a state award for their fall musical, and several Montclair teens became National Merit Scholarship semifinalists. In academics, Montclair High continued its renowned Magnet program, and Montclair Kimberley Academy (MKA) launched a new interdisciplinary STEM curriculum this year. **Montclair State University** had a milestone as well: Congresswoman (and alumna) Mikie Sherrill gave the commencement address in May, inspiring graduates as she herself transitioned to a new role (more on that later!). MSU also mobilized its **PSEG Sustainability Institute Green Teams** – student interns who worked with the Montclair township on environmental projects like home energy audits[sustainablejersey.com](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:~:text=Interns%20from%20the%20PSEG%20Institute,at%20the%20Montclair%20Farmers%E2%80%99%20Market)[sustainablejersey.com](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:~:text=sustainability%20and%20energy). This “town-gown” collaboration enriched both the community and the students’ learning, showcasing the value of having a major university in our backyard.

In community education, local nonprofits expanded enrichment programs. *Latinos of Montclair* launched “Ritmo Jardín,” a summer cultural program teaching kids percussion, Spanish vocabulary and Latin dance at the YMCA[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=Latinos%20of%20Montclair%20Launches%20New,Summer%20Cultural%20Enrichment%20Program). The Montclair Public Library hosted packed houses for its “Little Read” event in the spring and added a new digital media lab for teens. And Montclair’s Adult School (now in its 90th year) continued offering everything from ceramics to coding to hundreds of lifelong learners. Despite challenges, the **spirit of learning remained strong**. As Superintendent Turner said, this deficit is not the end of our story[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,for%20the%20current%20academic%20year) – Montclair is working “side by side to protect what matters most: the learning, growth, and well-being of our students”[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,for%20the%20current%20academic%20year). Class dismissed, 2025 – and here’s to a wiser 2026.

# NUT – General Tech & Innovation Acorns

Beyond our local scene, Montclair’s economy in 2025 was influenced by broader tech and innovation trends – often in quirky ways. Take **“eggflation”**, for example (or rather the lack thereof): after nationwide egg prices **skyrocketed in 2023**, this year they finally normalized, leading to what we playfully dubbed **“reverse eggflation.”** As one Acorn report put it, local value increased even while national groceries cheapened[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1jzpfcu/acorn_economy_week_2/#:~:text=Acorn%20Economy%20,comes%20to%20a%20close), meaning Montclair families paid a lot less for their omelets and holiday baking. Cheaper eggs and milk might not sound like tech, but improved supply chains (thanks to data-driven logistics and maybe fewer avian flu scares) played a role. We tracked our own **“eggs-per-acorn”** metric for fun, noting how many dozen eggs one Acorn Index unit could buy – and let’s just say by year’s end, the *yolks were on inflation*. This quirky indicator underscored a serious positive: **household staples became more affordable**, giving residents a little more cushion to spend on other things.

Tech innovation also touched Montclair in the form of **transportation and energy advances**. New Jersey doubled down on electric vehicles and green tech in 2025. The NJDEP rolled out rules requiring increasing sales of **electric trucks after 2025**, pushing automakers toward zero-emission models[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/newjerseydep/posts/-dep-is-leading-the-charge-on-electric-vehicles-in-new-jersey-this-driveelectric/1249553980549143/#:~:text=DEP%20is%20leading%20the%20charge,DEP%20is%20leading%20by). Montclair’s own delivery fleets and public works vehicles are eyeing electrification; already our recycling trucks run on cleaner fuels, and EV charging stations popped up in more public lots for residents switching to Teslas and Bolts. Statewide, investment in offshore wind and solar energy ramped up (you might have noticed those turbine parts being trucked down Bloomfield Ave en route to the coast!). These big innovations will mean a greener grid feeding Montclair homes in coming years – and possibly lower energy bills, too.

In the **tech business scene**, the New York metropolitan area’s growth spilled into Montclair. We saw more remote tech workers moving here for the suburban charm and fiber-optic internet, turning cafes into weekday coworking spots. A few Montclair-based startups gained traction: one local app developer, for instance, won a regional pitch contest for an AI-driven personal shopping app. And Montclair hosted an **Innovation Night** at the Wellmont Arts Plaza in October, where inventors and entrepreneurs demoed creations like smart home devices and eco-friendly packaging designs. The event – part-science fair, part-networking – highlighted the **creative brainpower** in our community. Jazz House Kids even had a booth showing off a student-built electronic instrument.

Finally, on the policy side, Montclair kept an eye on tariffs and trade winds. Global supply chain improvements meant holiday gifts were easier to find (no repeat of last year’s toy shortage), and local bike shops finally got those backordered parts. While international issues like computer chip tariffs didn’t hit Montclair directly, our residents benefited from the general easing of shortages. New car lots actually had cars again, and prices for used cars came down from Mars. In summary, 2025’s big tech and innovation currents – from **EV adoption** to **AI apps** – reached our oak-tree-lined streets in subtle but important ways. Montclair is nothing if not adaptable, and our squirrels are quick studies when it comes to new gadgets and ideas. If the Acorn Index is any indication, we’re **charging into the future** (sometimes literally, in our new EVs) with curiosity and savvy.

# LUX – Lifestyle & Leisure Acorns

Life in Montclair was as vibrant as ever in 2025 – a year filled with **street fairs, stage lights, and community spirit.** Our cultural calendar overflowed with events that brought out **thousands of residents and visitors** (and not just for the free samples!).

The summer’s crown jewel was the **Montclair Jazz Festival**, which returned bigger and bolder than ever. After a season of smaller concerts and Soundcheck shows, the Festival culminated in the **Downtown Jamboree on September 13th** – an all-day, open-air jazz extravaganza that literally stopped traffic. Bloomfield Avenue around Lackawanna Plaza transformed into a concert arena, with *three stages* of live music, a dance floor in the street, and over **150 food and artisan vendors** fueling the fun[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20over%20150%2B,Jazz%20Discovery%20Zone%2C%20and%20more). An estimated **26,000 attendees** filled downtown (yes, you read that right – it’s now the **largest free jazz fest in the NYC region**)[montclairjazzfestival.org](https://www.montclairjazzfestival.org/become-a-vendor#:~:text=). From noon to night, world-class artists like Lakecia Benjamin, Jazzmeia Horn, Christian McBride’s band, and the Gotham Kings blew the crowd away[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=merchandise)[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=Headliners%20for%20the%20event%20include,generational%20quintet). Families camped out with lawn chairs, kids got their faces painted in the Family Jazz Discovery Zone, and our own Montclair Brewery unveiled a special “Jazz Ale” for the occasion[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20over%20150%2B,Jazz%20Discovery%20Zone%2C%20and%20more). As twilight fell, the Block Party kept grooves going with DJ Brother Mister (a.k.a. Christian McBride in a DJ booth) spinning tunes[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=Zone%2C%20and%20more). The 14th annual Montclair Jazz Festival truly hit a new high note – **a Golden Acorn moment** for sure (spoiler!).

*Musicians heat up the stage at the 2025 Montclair Jazz Festival Downtown Jamboree. The free September event drew an estimated 26,000 people to downtown Montclair for 8+ hours of live jazz across multiple stages*[*montclairjazzfestival.org*](https://www.montclairjazzfestival.org/become-a-vendor#:~:text=)*. It’s now hailed as one of the region’s premier music festivals – and it’s all right here in Montclair!*

Not to be outdone, June brought the **4th Annual Montclair Pride Festival**, organized by Out Montclair. On June 14th, downtown was awash in rainbow flags and joyous crowds as this *inclusive celebration* took over Bloomfield Avenue. After successful festivals in 2022, 2023, and 2024, the **2025 Pride Festival featured live entertainment on three stages and 200+ vendors** ranging from food trucks to local artists[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L399%20The%204th,drink%20vendors%2C%20food%20trucks%2C%20LGBTQ). It was officially recognized as one of the top suburban Pride events in the nation[montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Visitors/Things-to-Do/Special-Events/Montclair-Pride-Festival#:~:text=%23%20Montclair%20Pride%20Festival%20,June%2014th) – and you could tell, from the incredible lineup (Dominique Jackson of *Pose* was a host!) to the huge turnout of families, teens, and allies. There was dancing in the streets (quite literally during the evening street dance party), and a moving equality rally by local leaders. Montclair once again proved itself a beacon of love and diversity, with residents coming together to **amplify LGBTQ+ voices and stories**[montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Visitors/Things-to-Do/Special-Events/Montclair-Pride-Festival#:~:text=We%20invite%20all%20families%20to,celebrating%20diverse%20identities%20and%20backgrounds). And yes, **Woofie’s pet van**making its debut at Pride – only in Montclair do we combine pet pampering with Pride partying!

Our town’s beloved traditions continued to thrive. On July 4th, Montclair hosted the region’s **largest Independence Day parade**, complete with marching bands, vintage cars, creative floats, and community groups winding down Bloomfield Avenue[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,Grand%20Marshal%20was%20the%20Montclair). The parade – an annual highlight since 1947 – drew big crowds (water squirt guns and all), followed by a family picnic and fireworks at Yogi Berra Stadium. In early June, the **Montclair African American Heritage Parade & Festival** returned to a festive atmosphere, celebrating Black culture with step dancers, drumlines, and local legends as Grand Marshals. From the **Greek Festival** at St. Demetrios Church (opa!) to Montclair’s **Oktoberfest** block party at Walnut Street, there was never a dull weekend.

Arts and film were also in the limelight. **Montclair Film Festival 2025** took place in October, drawing filmmakers and cinema buffs for 10 days of screenings at the Clairidge and Wellmont. Buzz was particularly strong for a certain Netflix production that filmed a scene at Montclair High School over the summer[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna#:~:text=Montclair%20,2025%20Property%20Taxes%20Introduced%20in) – yes, *Adam Sandler* was in town, producing a coming-of-age movie. (Local rumor: Sandler popped into a Watchung Plaza deli during filming. Montclair: where Hollywood meets hoagies.) The **Montclair Art Museum** launched a critically acclaimed exhibit of Charles White’s drawings in the fall, and hosted free First Thursdays that brought art lovers together. Even our historic **Bellevue Theatre** in Upper Montclair got a new lease on life – Montclair Film and Clairidge Cinema struck an agreement to reopen the 1922 movie palace soon[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bellevue%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair), sparking excitement for its grand return (indie films and popcorn under that iconic marquee, here we come!).

From dining to nightlife, lifestyle in Montclair kept pace with the fun. **Restaurant Week 2025** in September saw record participation – over 50 eateries offered specials, from fancy pre-fixe dinners to casual cafe deals, feeding both our bellies and our sense of community. New nightlife spots like **Boozie’s Wine Shoppe & Bar** at Lackawanna Station became the go-to for a laid-back evening sip[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,1%20Lackawanna%20Plaza%2C%20Montclair). And let’s not forget our parks and outdoors: this year a new pollinator garden opened at Edgemont Park thanks to local volunteers, and the *Montclair Running Company* hosted monthly fun runs drawing dozens of health-conscious neighbors. For a “quiet” suburb, Montclair sure knows how to live it up. **Lifestyle in 2025 was LUX indeed** – luxurious not just in a material way, but in the richness of experiences. Whether you were dancing at a festival, enjoying a gallery opening, or simply people-watching at Church Street Café, Montclair provided a **vibrant, inclusive, and never-boring home** for all of us.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Jersey_gubernatorial_election#:~:text=The%202025%20New%20Jersey%20gubernatorial,limited)",1,1767359628.0,thedailysquirrel,0,1.0,False

Last year, his daughter (41F) moved next door, so I was expecting to see him over to visit her. However, for the past few months it's almost as though he is treating her place like a second home. She leaves work at 9am and 2-3 days a week he will come over while she is gone to hangout there. He casualy mentioned that he was just having his breakfast , but he isn't there for just an hour. He will spend 2-3 hours there. He always leaves before she comes home from work at 5pm, and he is rarely there when she is. 

Once he mentioned, "" if I'm sitting on the porch drinking coffee, are you going to join me?"" I acted like I didn't hear him and I didn't respond. He has also mentioned if everything was alright, because I kept my blinds shut one week. I installed a ring camera, and noticed he was putting his own trash in it. /

Not tragic sad, just fluorescent lighting, plastic chairs, the smell of warm detergent, and people staring at spinning clothes like theyre waiting for their life to do something.

I go there on Sundays because my buildings washer likes to break at the worst times. It was late afternoon, raining outside, and I was doing laundry with the same energy I do everything lately. Functional, quiet, dont think too much.

I had my headphones in and a basket on my hip, loading the machine when I noticed him. A guy around my age sitting on the far end hunched over like he was trying to fold himself into the chair.

He kept wiping his face with his sleeve.

At first I assumed allergies. Then I heard the sound, not sobbing, not loud crying, just that tight shaky breathing people do when theyre trying to cry silently so nobody can tell.

I did the normal thing, I looked away. Because in public youre supposed to pretend you dont see people falling apart.

But then I saw his hands, he was holding his phone like it was useless, like it had died at the worst moment. He stared at the screen, pressed something, then dropped it into his lap and covered his face.

And before I could talk myself out of it I walked over and said quietly,

""Hey, are you okay? Do you need to call someone?""

He looked up fast, embarrassed, like hed been caught. His eyes were red and he tried to smile which made it worse.

""My phone got cut off,"" he said, voice cracking. ""Im trying to call my mom, I just need to hear her voice for a second.""

Then he said this and it hit me right in the chest because it was so specific:

""I dont even need her to fix anything, I just need someone to sound like home.""

I stood there holding my laundry basket like an idiot because I knew that feeling. Not the exact situation but that sentence, the need for one voice to make you feel less lost.

So I pulled out my phone. ""Use mine.""

He blinked. ""No its okay, I dont want to—""

""Seriously, its fine.""

He hesitated like he was deciding whether he deserved it then took my phone with both hands like it was something fragile.

He went outside under the awning because it was still raining and I sat back down pretending to scroll, pretending I wasnt listening.

But when people talk to someone they love you can hear it even when you dont mean to. His voice changed the second someone answered, it got softer.

""Hi Mom,"" and you could almost hear him unclench.

Then after a pause he whispered ""Im okay, I just needed a minute.""

When he came back in he handed my phone back like it was a gift and kept saying thank you like he didnt know how else to hold himself together.

I shrugged it off the way people do because making it emotional feels embarrassing. ""No worries, weve all had days.""

He nodded really hard like that sentence mattered. Then he looked at me. ""Im Daniel.""

I told him my name.

We didnt become friends, didnt exchange numbers, didnt do the ""we should totally hang out"" thing. He went back to his laundry, I went back to mine.

But when I left I kept thinking about that line. ""I just need someone to sound like home.""

A few months passed.

Then one evening after work I stopped at the same little grocery store near the laundromat. Id had one of those days where nothing catastrophic happens but everything feels heavy anyway. My boss had been weird, the train was late, I spilled coffee on my sleeve, my brain was stuck in a loop of ""youre messing everything up"" for no good reason.

I wasnt crying but I was close.

I was standing in the checkout line staring at gum trying to breathe normally when the cashier said my total and I reached for my wallet.

And it wasnt there.

I froze. Checked my pockets, my bag, the other pocket I already checked, my coat. Nothing.

My face went hot so fast. I could feel the people behind me shifting, the line tightening around my panic.

I stammered ""Im sorry I think I left my wallet at home.""

The cashier gave me that tired look. ""I can set it aside.""

And I know thats a normal solution but in that moment it felt like the last straw, like my body had been waiting all day for permission to fall apart.

I stood there holding my groceries trying not to cry in front of strangers over a wallet.

Then a voice behind me said ""Hey.""

Not loud, just close.

I turned and saw him. Daniel.

Same face, same calm eyes. He looked at me for a second and his expression softened like he recognized the feeling not just me.

He didnt ask a bunch of questions, didnt make it a scene. He just stepped forward, tapped his card on the reader and said to the cashier ""Ive got it.""

I stared at him. ""No, absolutely not.""

He shook his head once, gentle but firm. ""You let me borrow your phone.""

And then he smiled just a little and said the exact kind of line that makes your throat tighten:

""You sounded like home that day.""

I stood there blinking like an idiot because my brain was trying to decide whether I was allowed to accept kindness without earning it.

""I can pay you back.""

He waved it off. ""Dont worry about it, just keep doing what you did.""

That was the whole payoff. Not a big speech, not an exchange of numbers, not a dramatic hug. Just a small gesture that turned my worst moment of the day into something survivable.

We walked out at the same time. The rain had stopped and the sidewalk was shiny.

He nodded toward the laundromat. ""I still go Sundays.""

I laughed because of course he did.

""My moms doing better by the way.""

""Good,"" I said and I meant it.

We stood there for a second in that awkward almost friend space, then he gave a quick wave and headed down the street. I went the other way.

And I dont know if this is cheesy but on the walk home I kept thinking how strange it is that you can be a completely normal person in a completely ordinary place and still end up being the thing that keeps someone together for five minutes.

Sometimes its not grand, sometimes its just a phone call under an awning, sometimes its a card tap at a checkout, sometimes its a stranger giving you back your dignity before you even ask.

And then everyone goes home quietly, like that's just what people do.",36,1767359464.0,stories,7,0.95,False

Almost exactly a year ago, I came to this sub desperate for ways to help my uncle feel more comfortable while living with advanced COPD and cancer. Sadly, just 4 months after that post, he passed away peacefully.

Here is some advice I wish I had:

Clean and improve the home environmentMy uncle was living with a family member who struggled with addiction, and there was a cat.
Whenever I could visit, I deep-cleaned: vacuumed, dusted, washed bedding, and aired out rooms.

Let them rest and take over daily tasksHe always insisted “it’s okay, I can do it,” but getting up to cook or make coffee exhausted him. I handled breakfast while he rested.

Guide breathing techniques after a coughing fitOne of the most helpful things was teaching and reminding him about pursed-lip breathing. It’s simple and really eased his shortness of breath.

Encourage small, frequent, easy-to-eat mealsBig meals were overwhelming and made him feel bloated, which pressed on his lungs. Instead, we went for small snacks/meals every few hours:

	•  Greek yogurt (plain or with a little honey)

	•  Smoothies (easy on the stomach)

	•  Eggs, cheese sticks, avocado on toast

	•  Nuts or nut butter

	•  Soft fruits like bananas or berries


These things don’t cure anything, but it at least improves the symptoms.

Preston Pennington Sep 26 2025

Coffee roasting is where raw, green coffee beans transform into the aromatic, flavorful beans we brew daily. While roasting can seem like an art, it’s equally a science. Understanding how **heat, time, and airflow** interact inside a roaster, especially fluid-bed machines like the [Fresh Roast SR540](https://www.homeroastingsupplies.com/products/fresh-roast-sr540?variant=49958129860890) and [SR800](https://www.homeroastingsupplies.com/products/fresh-roast-sr800?variant=49958333350170) Which empowers you to roast with confidence, precision, and consistency.

In this guide, we’ll explore the chemistry, physics, and science of coffee roasting, explain why these variables matter, and show how you can apply them to your home roasting journey.

# The Roasting Stages: A Quick Overview on the Science of Coffee Roasting

Before diving into the science, let’s recap the general roast progression:

1. **Drying Phase (0–4 minutes):** Beans lose moisture, preparing for chemical reactions.
2. **Maillard Reaction (4–7 minutes):** Sugars and amino acids react, producing browning and flavor complexity.
3. **First Crack (\~6–8 minutes):** Beans expand, releasing steam and pressure. Light roasts often stop here.
4. **Caramelization (7–10 minutes):** Sugars break down, creating sweetness and body.
5. **Second Crack (\~9–12 minutes):** Oils migrate to the surface, producing bold, dark roasts.

>

# Heat: The Engine of Roasting

Heat is the driving force behind all chemical transformations.

# Types of Heat Transfer

* **Conduction:** Heat moves from hot surfaces into beans (dominant in drum roasters).
* **Convection:** Heat carried by air moves through beans (dominant in fluid-bed roasters like Fresh Roast).
* **Radiation:** Heat emitted from surfaces or elements.

# Why It Matters

* Too much heat early on = scorched exteriors, underdeveloped interiors.
* Too little heat = baked flavors, flat cup profiles.

# Fresh Roast Advantage

Because Fresh Roast models rely heavily on convection, heat is applied more evenly, reducing risk of scorching and enhancing consistency.

# Time: The Roast Curve

Time is about pacing the roast to let chemical reactions fully develop.

# Three Key Phases

1. **Drying:** Beans move from green to yellow. Slow but steady heat is essential.
2. **Development:** Flavor precursors form during the Maillard reaction.
3. **Finishing:** First crack signals the start of roast level decision-making.

# Roast Curve Example

* Light roast: 7–8 minutes total
* Medium roast: 9–11 minutes
* Dark roast: 11–13 minutes

>

# Airflow: The Hidden Variable

Airflow doesn’t just keep beans moving—it directly shapes flavor.

# Functions of Airflow

* **Heat Distribution:** Ensures even roast.
* **Chaff Removal:** Prevents burning husks from affecting flavor.
* **Temperature Control:** Increases or decreases heat transfer rate.

# Fresh Roast Control

Both the SR540 and SR800 feature adjustable fan levels (1–9). More airflow = faster bean movement, more convection, and lighter body. Less airflow = slower development, heavier body.

# The Chemistry of Flavor

# Maillard Reaction

* Produces hundreds of flavor compounds.
* Responsible for caramel, nutty, and chocolatey notes.

# Caramelization

* Breaks down sugars into sweet, rich flavors.
* Extends sweetness into medium and dark roasts.

# Pyrolysis

* At higher temps, beans release CO₂ and volatile compounds.
* Contributes to smoky, bold flavors in dark roasts.

# Applying Science to Fresh Roast Machines

With fluid-bed technology, you have more control over heat and airflow compared to many small drum roasters.

# Example Settings for SR540/SR800

* **Light Roast:** High airflow, medium heat, stop just after first crack.
* **Medium Roast:** Moderate airflow, steady heat, end before second crack.
* **Dark Roast:** Lower airflow, higher heat, push into second crack.

# Accessories That Help

* [EXT Tube](https://www.homeroastingsupplies.com/products/blemished-sr540-800-ext-tube): Enhances circulation and roast evenness.
* [Bean Cooler](https://www.homeroastingsupplies.com/products/coffee-roaster-bean-cooler): Cools beans quickly to lock in flavor.

# Questions you might have when roasting your own beans

**Q: Why do my beans taste grassy?**  
You likely stopped roasting before first crack or didn’t allow the Maillard reaction to finish.

**Q: How do I avoid baked flavors?**  
Increase heat application during the drying and development stages, but don’t rush.

**Q: Does airflow affect flavor clarity?**  
Yes. More airflow emphasizes brightness; less airflow enhances body.

**Q: What’s the best way to learn roast control?**  
Keep a roast log: track time to first crack, airflow settings, and taste results.

Roasting coffee is both science and art. By understanding how **heat, time, and airflow** interact, you can control flavor outcomes and roast confidently. With the [Fresh Roast SR540](https://www.homeroastingsupplies.com/products/fresh-roast-sr540?variant=49958129860890) and [SR800](https://www.homeroastingsupplies.com/products/fresh-roast-sr800?variant=49958333350170), mastering these variables is easier than ever.

To start, my mom and I have always had a rocky relationship. If someone pissed her off she was coming home and yelling at me about it. I thought that she was in a better place because she wasn’t just screaming at me all the time. It seemed her mental health was in a better place and she wasn’t unloading all her emotions on to me, even my brother (who has been very low contact with her for more than 10 years thought she was in a better place and had done some healing). Unfortunately I let my walls down and we became closer than we ever have been for the last two years. 

My husband and I found out we were expecting and she was so excited, she helped when I was sick and would cook me meals. We talked extensively about my plans for labour and post partum. The plan was for her and my husband to be there for my labor and once the baby was born she would leave so we could have some time just me my husband and the baby. Then once I’m in the post partum room, she would come back. My mom was supposed to take off the first week of work after I had my baby to help. I started to notice at the end of my pregnancy things were changing, when talking about when I was going to have the baby she would say I under no circumstances was getting induced because she was and it was painful. She would talk about how much my dad pissed her off during labor and how she wanted nothing to do with him, how her mom was all she wanted during labor and post partum. I thought she was just sharing her experience. 

Fast forward, I go into labour and my mom is there the whole time. Her car broke down as she was pulling into the parking lot and I told her if she needs to use our car it’s there. Thirty minutes after my daughter is born, the placenta is delivered, my dr is stitching me up and I’m feeling very overwhelmed with a room full of people. My husband can see this and asks me if I want him to ask my mom to leave, I tell my mom that I’m ready for her to go. She scoffs at me and go back to stroking my baby’s back while she’s on my chest. Im super anxious at this point because I don’t know how to ask her again without her berating me in front of all these people. A few minutes go by, she still hasn’t left, so my husband sternly tells her that she has to go as I previously asked. She yells at my husband about how her car broke down and her daughter just gave birth and she needs time, and they haven’t even weighed her grand daughter yet etc.. My OB obviously sees all this then tells her it’s time to go and she can bring my post partum supplies to my room, she storms out crying. I tell them to take my baby and weigh her so that I can tell my mom. She never comes back to the postpartum room and goes home. I call her the next morning to chat and show her the baby while my husband is gone to get me breakfast and she asks how long my husband is taking off. I tell her that he has 3 weeks off but can take 6 if I need him to. She asks me if he’s even going to be there or if he’s just going to go hunting the whole time. I told her that obviously he’s going to be there for me and the baby.

We are discharged the next day and before we’re even home I call her to come over. She comes over and snuggles the baby, when it’s time to change her my husband changes her bum and gets her dressed. He struggles a bit to get her dressed because he’s never even held a baby before her, so he’s afraid to break her. My husband goes to tend to our dogs and my mom is holding my daughter and says “he can’t take care of you and her, he can’t even get her dressed, you need me” I tell her that he’s learning, as am I and that he has been doing an excellent job taking care of us. She goes home and the next morning we have to return to the hospital for follow up labs. My baby’s bilirubin is dangerously high and we’re readmitted for light therapy. I was so emotional, being unable to hold my baby for more than 24 hours other than feeding her every 3 hours for 20-30 minutes. My mom stopped by the hospital to bring me a coffee and give me a hug while we were admitted.

 The next afternoon we are discharged from the hospital, and it’s my birthday so I invite my mom, step dad and in laws over for dinner. My mom offers to bring the dinner and I accept. She comes over around 8pm with dinner, this is my step dad’s first time seeing the baby. I have previously discussed with my mom the rules I have for baby, wash your hands before holding and no kisses from anyone. I ask my step dad to wash his hand before I hand her to him and he looks at me with a very annoyed look and says “don’t worry I’m not going to break any of your stupid rules”, which hurt my feeling but I didn’t say anything in response to this. My mom holds the baby while I get plates and utensils ready, I dish up a plate and grab my baby and sit down to eat. My mom says “I’m going to grab her while you eat” I said “it’s okay I want to hold her”. I had just gone more than 24 hours with her in an incubator, I wanted to hold her. My mom was super annoyed by this but doesn’t say anything. For the next 2 days we have to go to the hospital everyday for repeat blood draws and the third day we have a drs appointment. We live an hour out of town so these appointments take all day with a baby. 

On Halloween by daughter is 10 days old, we go “trick or treating” at the grandparents houses. She was super fussy so I left her in the carrier, my mom tried to take her out of the carrier 4 times before we left, despite me repeatedly telling her to leave her in the carrier. A couple days later we go over for dinner, we get there and I hand the baby to my mom. She’s sitting on a bar height stool with her feet on a bar height counter and rests my daughter on her legs so she can take pictures of her, this stresses me out but I don’t say anything. My daughter starts to chew on her hands and show hunger cues so I say “she’s hungry I’m going to feed her” my mom gets annoyed and says she’s not hungry yet, I tell her yes she is and I grab her. I am in the middle of changing her before she eats and my mom comes over and says “let me change her I haven’t done it yet” at this point I already have the old diaper off, bum cream on, and I’m putting on the new diaper. I tell her I’m almost done anyways. I feed her and we sit down for dinner. 

After dinner she starts to get fussy so my husband grabs her while the rest of us finish eating. I tell them that she’s starting to cluster feed and we should get going soon. My husband is trying to calm her down and my mom walks up and tries to grab her from him. He says just give me a minute, because he wants to calm her down first. My mom bursts into tears and storms out of the room, my step dad starts yelling at me and says “what is wrong with you, you don’t let anyone hold your kid, you’re horrible for what you’re doing to your mother” I pack up my baby, give them both a hug and I leave. I don’t talk to my mom for another week. 

The first day my husband goes back to work my mom texts me to come over. She comes over and starts by says “so what’s going on with you” and the proceeds to yell at me for 15 minutes about how she was mad she was asked to leave the delivery room and how she was supposed to take the first week of her life off but I never gave her a definite answer, and that she feels I haven’t let her hold the baby enough. I tried to calmly (because my daughter was in a carrier on my chest and I didn’t want to yell and cry) explain to her that she disrespected my boundary by refusing to leave and I won’t accept her speaking poorly about my husband. I didn’t give her a definite answer about taking off the first week because we were in and out of the hospital the whole first week. I wasn’t letting anyone hold the baby for hours on end at the beginning because it heightened my anxiety, and her disrespecting my boundaries already was making my anxiety worse about her holding my baby. She screamed at me that I need to go back on my meds (my anxiety meds that I have been off for two years, I had seen my psychiatrist the day before and she said that she saw no reason to re start them). 

After this she sent me a series of long winded text messages about how I’ve done nothing but disrespect her, she’s extremely disappointed in me, she’s done so much for me, she had a right to a relationship with my daughter even if I don’t like it, this is all happening because of my husband and I have no say in what’s happening because he’s controlling me and many many more things. She’s now bringing other family members into it and trying to pin my the against me, even my brother who is low contact with her (which would never happen because we both know how she is, he also got a long winded text message at the same time as me about how he’s a disappointment too). 

I don’t know what to do, I don’t know where to go from here, I don’t know if I’m just a very hormonal postpartum mom and this is all normal. I don’t even know what I’m looking for from posting this, if anyone has advice or insight about what I should do it would be very helpful. ",1,1767359348.0,EstrangedAdultChild,1,0.57,False

 Failing classes, parents going through a divorce, the whole thing. I spent a lot of extra time with him just talking and helping him figure out how to get back on track. Eventually the program ended and I moved away and honestly I forgot about most of it

Today I stopped at this little bookshop cafe near my new apartment. I ordered a coffee and the guy behind the counter looked familiar but I couldnt place him.

 Didnt think much of it

When I got my receipt there was a note written on the back. It said ""you probably dont remember me but you tutored me at the community center years ago. you told me I was smarter than I thought and that stuck with me. Im in college now. thank you""

I looked up and he just gave me this little nod and went back to making drinks

I sat there for like twenty minutes just staring at my coffee. I barely remember saying that to him. It was probably just something I said offhand trying to encourage a struggling kid. But apparently it meant something

I wanted to go talk to him but I didnt want to make it weird or emotional while he was working. So I just left a big tip and wrote ""proud of you"" on a napkin

El survived. She grabbed one of those emergency go-to bags that she and Hopper once packed, incase they needed to flee (and thats how Hopper also knows that she's out there somewhere). El managed to get to Iceland, by boarding a ship. Found a cozy little town near her three waterfalls. And here, she gets to live the life she deserves. Away from anyone else's influence, she is able to discover herself as her own person. 

She completely refuses to use her powers and with time, they start to weaken and eventually disappear.

She gives herself a new name, but its still something that echoes the essence of 'el' and 'jane'.

With this new identity, she starts a new life. Initially she works at a small cafe/shop or anything that grabs her attention. Thru the years she gets bigger and bigger jobs and saves up as much money as she can, because she finally has a dream of her own. A dream to own a big farm, adopt and rescue all kinds of animals possible and live the rest of her life like that. And maybe she'll even organise workshops for little kids where she teaches them to about what's and how's of taking care of animals.

During this time, Mike gets his bachelor's and master's degrees done and is already famous for his books that he publish with stories inspired by his and his friends' stories.

Its already been 8 years now. 

Mike, in need of new inspiration, decides to go on a writer's retreat. He chooses Iceland because it has abundant waterfalls. He is now ready to tell the mage's story. But he needs to confront it himself as well. Hence, Iceland.He chooses the town El is living in,not knowing she is actually there. 

He reaches the town and one morning he is sitting in the same cafe that El worked at years ago. When the part timer comes to serves him his coffee, Mike impulsively asks, if there's a place somewhere in Iceland where he can see three waterfalls. The guy calls in a female barista from the kitchen, as she was once close with El, who worked here once, and she knows the location because El talked about it with them a lot.

The girl comes over and gives Mike the location. She jokingly adds how her friend is also crazy about the three waterfalls. Mike's heart drops for a second, but he composes himself back and tells himself that it might not be who he thinks it is and he is getting ahead of himself. He doesn't want to get his hopes up and then be disappointed and depressed.

In the later afternoon, Mike packs a small backpack and sets out for his destination to catch the highly recommended, most beautiful ever seen sunset at the three waterfalls place.

He spends multiple hours just sitting there, basking in the lap of nature. However, he is also slightly sad, that someone else who he imagined to be here, was not afterall here.
He starts to think that maybe, his escape theory about El was not true at all and now he will have to abandon the belief that helped him carrying on with his life after that hell of a experience 10 years ago.

But as he is packing his things to go back to his rented cabin, he sees El. She is standing a little far away, looking at the waterfalls. It has to be her. Is he imagining her? Or is this real?

Mike runs towards her, he runs for his life. El notices him approaching. She can't believe it at first, but its Mike. They have a very tearful reunion, that needed a lot of reassurance that its real. But at last, they have met. They have finally met. 

They tell each other of the lives they have lived. Mike tells El about everyone from Hawkins and their lives. The talk goes on for days. And after about a month, they decide to move to a nice little countryside town, near Montauk, where now Hopper and Joyce live.

El finally comes home and reunites with her loved ones.

Mike and El buy a plot of land and build their dream farmhouse. El lives the life she wants with loads of adopted animals and Mike continues writing books. And at last, they finally have their happily ever after.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1pl7zs6/mixed\_sibo\_sifo\_my\_herbal\_experience\_berberine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1pl7zs6/mixed_sibo_sifo_my_herbal_experience_berberine/)

# Why I stopped

The main reason is simple: **my symptoms weren’t improving**, and honestly I’d argue they were **getting worse** by weeks 3–4.

Early on (first \~2 weeks) I did notice **some stool “form” improvement** and a bit more consistency. I definitely had textbook die-off... but the longer I stayed on the herbals, the more I felt like my system was just becoming **more reactive/irritated**, and the chart reflects that — more frequent “red days” and the overall cycle didn’t break.

# This month of daily tracking was surprisingly enlightening. My symptoms aren’t random — they follow a repeatable flare pattern:

* **Phase 1 — Build-up (2–4 days):** symptoms gradually stack up:
   * reflux / throat burn / gnawing stomach pain
   * bloating, gas, trapped pressure, noisy gut
   * fatigue, brain fog, heavy “poisoned” feeling
   * tonsil flare-ups (swelling/pain)
   * BMs still occur, but they become less satisfying / don’t relieve the pressure
* **Phase 2 — Peak flare:** things suddenly tip over into a “red day”:
   * intense upper GI symptoms (acid/GERD, burning, nausea-ish discomfort)
   * urgency ramps up, intense cramps/pressure increase
   * I’m often wiped out / stuck resting, bed bound
   * Horrible stomach and intestinal pain like I've been cut from the inside
   * Gnawing Pain in stomach, gall bladder area and pain under my belly button on the left and right side
   * Sometimes I'd start out with a slightly constipated BM
* **Phase 3 — Purge:** a “dumping” day:
   * multiple BMs and/or explosive diarrhea
   * stools get progressively looser
   * this is the point where my body seems to force-clear whatever’s building
   * My intestines really hurt
   * HSV outbreak often follows this purge
   * Very gassy, require heat therapy, hot baths and water bottle seem to help
   * Slight anal bleeding due to diarrhea and gas
* **Phase 4 — Partial reset:** after the purge, symptoms drop noticeably:
   * pressure/gurgling reduces day-by-day - I'd like to emphaise that this isn't linear, it can take a while to get any relief if any, but typically feel better after passing a BM. 
   * reflux and pain calm down after a few days
   * I’m not “normal,” but I’m more stable for a short window
   * then the **build-up starts again, starting with reflux symptoms** 

And the most consistent pattern is this:

**My big flare-ups almost always start with really bad stomach acid / reflux / GERD-type symptoms**, then progress into lower-GI chaos.

That’s made me question whether **SIBO is the root problem**, or more of a downstream result of something else (motility/acid/bile dysregulation, etc.).

# Where I’m at now (post-treatment)

It’s been about a week since stopping and I **haven’t seen a clear improvement**. If anything I feel like I’m still trending worse, or at least not stabilising. I think the herbal treatment although may have done some good, has really irritated and worn out my insides.

I’ve had:

* Ultrasound: “fine” (doctor mentioned **mild fatty liver**)
* Stool tests: fine
* Blood tests: fine
* No diet triggers I can point to other than Coffee & Spice definitely make it worse
* I have also realised that a major trigger can be anything viral such as the flu or food poisoning

But I’m also getting **chronic HSV outbreaks**, which makes me feel like *something is off* systemically / immune-wise on top of the gut stuff. I also had a yeast / fungal outbreak during treatment.

I believe the ""root causes"" may be one of these, but I wont be able to see a specialist for a while sadly so unsure what to do. Ultrasound did not show gallstones but GP said that she can not rule out sludge or functional issues.

**Bile Acid Diarrhea (BAD)**

**Bile Acid Reflux**

**Post Infectious Gut Dysfunction**

# What I’m trialling now (next steps)

For now I’m taking a break from antimicrobials and trying to calm / repair:

* **L-glutamine** (gut repair / barrier support)
* **Calcium carbonate + vitamin D with meals** (trialing as a “binder” approach in case bile acids are irritating downstream)
* **Benfotiamine (Taking with Mag Glycinate / Orotate)**
* **Zinc carnosine**
* **Mebeverine for gut pain relief**
* **Propanalol for anxiety**

I’m also considering:

* Asking a specialist about **bile acid sequestrants** (if this is bile-acid-related) — but I won’t see them until **March**, and my GP in the UK can’t prescribe them.
* **Amitriptyline** — because what I’m dealing with looks a lot like **IBS-D / gut over-stimulation / visceral hypersensitivity**, and at this point I’d rather stabilise than keep nuking my gut with herbs.
* Some kind of **motility support**, but I honestly don’t know what’s appropriate to ask for in my situation.

I’m **not introducing probiotics yet** because I don’t feel like I’m at a stable baseline.

# What I’m asking the community

I know this is a SIBO sub, but I’m starting to feel like **I can’t “fix SIBO” until I understand the root cause**, and I’m stuck.

Has anyone had a similar pattern where:

* Flares reliably **start with upper GI acid/reflux**
* Then progress into **diarrhea + “reset”**
* Antimicrobials (rifaximin/herbs) **don’t resolve the cycle** (Rifaximin made my BM's the best they've been in years but unfortunately I rebounded after treatment in July)
* And it feels more like **dysregulation** than “just bacteria”

Any insights (bile acid issues? reflux/bile reflux? motility dysfunction? post-infectious gut?) or ideas on what to explore next would really help. Thanks so much in advance.

I met this guy at my friend’s 18th birthday. I got really drunk (yes, I know I’m young, but I do well in school, grades are solid, priorities in check). I ended up sitting with her cousin, 19M, and honestly it’s super embarrassing I kept asking him to go with me to the bathroom because I was peeing like every five minutes  He was such a gentleman about it.

Next thing I know, my friend posted a pic of us together, me leaning on his shoulder. Mortifying. I apologized afterward, and he said he had a crush on me for months… which, honestly, I find hard to believe since it was my first time meeting him. Anyway, he asked what flowers I liked, I said I wasn’t ready for that kind of thing yet, and he was cool with it. He even asked if we could “start over” so I wouldn’t feel embarrassed around him. After that, we didn’t really talk… until last December, when I randomly asked if we could grab coffee.

This is new for me since I usually prioritize studying, but I want to give it a try. I just… don’t want it to be awkward. How do I apologize without overdoing it? What’s normal to talk about for a first meet like this? Also, should we split the bill 50/50, or should I cover it since I asked him?

PS: I don’t really wear revealing stuff. I usually just go for basic short shirts and shoes. Any ideas on what would be cute but chill for this kind of meet-up?",2,1767359139.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

Outside of work, my boyfriend and I have an amazing relationship- A LOT of fun, adventure, romance, and a very intense emotional connection.

At work, however, no one knew about us because the relationship wasn’t really allowed and to protect his job.

While we worked together, a new girl started. I felt that she and my boyfriend became overly friendly. These were behaviours that felt questionable:

He began going out with her for quick cigarette breaks, coffee, and lunch without telling me. Since we worked together, he said he wasn’t hiding it from me, as it was right in front of me.  
One night, they went out to dinner after work. He didn’t tell me and when I called him three times that night, he didn’t answer, even though I knew he had seen my calls.  
They also started carpooling together. She lived along his route, so he would pick her up on his bike and drop her home.  
When her dog passed away, he made her personalised keyrings as a gift: her dog and her on his bike.  
He frequently messaged her, checking in to see if she needed help or if she was okay being alone after hours when she stayed late at work ie made sure she was safe.  
He joked about me having “great senses” to her, implying that I was watching or monitoring them.  
They messaged each other a lot, both during and outside of work, sharing GIFs, inside jokes, love hearts and love yous. 

None of this was something he could do openly with me as he said we have a real relationship.

I know that no one likes to feel controlled. We’ve had many conversations about this, and he promised not to engage with her in ways that would undermine our relationship. To improve our relationship, I have left work. However, he continues to interact with her behind my back. e.g. they recently added each other on Instagram and he made his account private so I wouldn’t know. How do you know when attraction to someone else is harmless versus a threat to your relationship? At what point do repeated secretive behaviours become a dealbreaker?

1q1xxb6,https://i.redd.it/ds2dwexinxag1.jpeg,Nothing Worked for Me After 30… Until I Learned This One Thing,"# When “doing everything right” suddenly stopped working

Somewhere around 30, my body and brain quietly changed the rules without telling me.

The stuff that used to work… just didn’t.

Coffee stopped being a boost and became a life support system.  
Workouts that once made me feel sharp turned into something I had to *survive*.  
My sex drive dipped, my focus scattered, and my “get things done” gear felt permanently stuck.

On paper, I was fine.

I ate decently.  
I moved.  
I wasn’t staying up until 3 a.m. gaming anymore.

And yet:

* I woke up tired.
* I went to bed tired.
* My motivation was on mute.

If this sounds uncomfortably familiar, keep reading—because what finally changed things was not a productivity trick, a new diet, or another pre‑workout powder.

It was understanding *one simple thing* that almost no one had talked to me about directly.

# Problem: After 30, the “old you” stops showing up

There’s this weird gap men don’t talk about.

You are not old.  
You are not sick.  
But you are definitely **not** functioning like you used to.

You notice it in small, annoying ways:

* You say “I’m tired” more times a day than you’d like to admit.
* You start more things than you finish.
* The gym feels heavier, and progress stalls even when you show up.
* Your belly slowly, stubbornly joins the party.​

And then there’s the more uncomfortable stuff:

* Less interest in sex, or more performance anxiety when it comes up.
* Shorter fuse, less patience, more low‑level irritability.
* This background sense that your edge—your drive, your “let’s go” energy—is fading.​

You do what you’re supposed to do:

* Clean up your eating.
* Try to sleep more.
* Drag yourself through cardio.

You might even get basic blood work.

“Everything looks normal.”

Cool.  
So why does your life not feel normal?

# Agitation: The quiet fear men rarely admit

Here’s the part that messes with your head.

This doesn’t feel like a one‑off slump.  
It feels like a **trend**.

You start thinking things like:

>

Because the changes aren’t dramatic enough to call a crisis, you can kind of ignore them.

Until you realise what they’re costing you:

* You don’t push as hard on the projects that could actually change your career.
* You stop initiating intimacy as often, which slowly changes the dynamic at home.
* You bail on plans because “you’re wiped,” even when you didn’t really do that much.

And this is the part no one warns you about:

Low‑level, persistent underperformance becomes your new normal.

Not because you’re lazy.  
Because your **system** is quietly underpowered.

For a lot of men, that “one thing” no one connects the dots on is this:

Your **testosterone and overall male hormone balance** are no longer doing their job properly—and they can be “technically normal” on a lab sheet while still trashing your energy, drive, and performance.​

Low or sub‑optimal testosterone is linked with:

* Low energy and constant fatigue
* Decreased motivation and ambition
* Increased body fat and reduced muscle
* Low sex drive and weaker performance
* Flat or depressed mood​

Sound familiar?

If nothing changes, this doesn’t magically level off.

The trajectory looks like:

* More belly, less strength
* More “I’ll do it later,” fewer big moves
* More distance in relationships
* More health issues in your 40s and 50s​

At some point, you realise this isn’t about squeezing in another workout.

It’s about figuring out *why* your engine isn’t firing.

# The one thing no one bothered to explain

The turning point for me was when I stopped asking:

“How do I force myself to do more?”

…and started asking:

“Why does my system feel underpowered in the first place?”

A lot of doctors and articles dance around this, but here’s the plain version:

* Testosterone and other male hormones naturally **decline** with age, starting around 30, roughly 1–1.5% per year for many men.​
* Modern lifestyle (poor sleep, stress, extra belly fat, processed food, no real strength training) **accelerates** that decline.​
* Even when your levels are “in range,” they can be **too low for you**, given the life you want to live.​

And because the drop is slow, it sneaks up on you:

* You adjust your expectations down.
* You call it “stress” or “adulting.”
* You lower the bar on what you think is realistic.

The “one thing” that finally unlocked change for me was accepting:

>

Once you see that, the whole strategy shifts.

# Solution: Fix the environment, not just your willpower

The guys who thrive after 30 aren’t necessarily more disciplined.

They’re the ones who accept that[ performance is biological first, psychological second.](https://mwebaro.com/11746/11183/3/)

The framework that actually helped looked like this:

1. Normalise the basics your hormones need
2. Train like your future self matters
3. Support the system that’s trying to upgrade

# 1. Normalise the basics your hormones need

Before doing anything fancy, you have to stop actively sabotaging your own biology.

That meant:

* **Sleep like it’s part of your job.** Most men massively underestimate this. Poor or short sleep lowers testosterone, raises cortisol, worsens insulin sensitivity, and trashes mood.​
* **Drop the permanent “dirty bulk” or “perma‑cut” mindset.** Too much body fat, especially around the belly, is tightly linked to lower testosterone and worse metabolic health. On the flip side, living in an aggressive calorie deficit also stresses your system.​
* **Stop pretending chronic stress is “just how life is”** Long‑term cortisol elevation is terrible for mood, sleep, body composition, and hormones. You don’t need a cabin in the woods; you need actual off switches—walks, hobbies, being unreachable for a bit.​

# 2. Train like your future self is watching

After 30, your body treats muscle as optional unless you prove otherwise.

And muscle is:

* Your main calorie‑burning engine
* A huge driver of insulin sensitivity
* A major “you feel strong and capable” signal

So the shift was:

* **Strength first, cardio second.** Lift 2–4x per week. Push, pull, hinge, squat. Get stronger over months, not just sweatier for 45 minutes.​
* **Consistency over hero workouts:** Three well‑done sessions weekly for a year beats two insane months followed by four months off.
* **Recovery as a skill.** The older you get, the more recovery *is* growth—sleep, walking, food, stress management. Overtraining on a stressed, under‑recovered body is how you kill hormones faster.​

This alone won’t fix everything.

But it sends a clear message to your body:

“We still use this machine. Keep it tuned.”

# 3. Support the system, don’t outsource it

Once you’re:

* Sleeping like an adult
* Lifting like someone who wants to be capable at 50
* Eating as you care about tomorrow, not just tonight

…then it can make sense to look at [support,](https://mwebaro.com/11746/11183/3/) not as a cheat code, but as scaffolding.

For a lot of men, that’s where something in the **male vitality/blood flow/hormone support** category can help—not instead of lifestyle, but on top of it.

# One resource that aligns with this approach

One example on that front is [Male Power XL,](https://mwebaro.com/11746/11183/3/) a natural men’s vitality supplement designed to target the exact domains that usually start failing after 30: energy, blood flow, stamina, and overall performance.​

According to its official materials and independent write‑ups, Male Power XL is built around a few key ideas:

* **Support natural testosterone.** It uses herbs like Tongkat Ali, Tribulus Terrestris, Maca root, and other plant‑based actives that are traditionally used to support healthy testosterone levels, libido, and drive.​
* **Improve blood flow and nitric oxide.** Ingredients such as L‑arginine and circulation‑supporting extracts help increase nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels and promotes stronger, more reliable blood flow—critical for both gym performance and erections.​
* **Back up energy and stamina.** The formula includes supportive nutrients and antioxidants aimed at helping you maintain stamina and endurance, so you can actually *use* the extra drive you’re rebuilding.​​

Where this fits into the bigger picture:

* It doesn’t replace proper sleep, training, or nutrition.
* It *can* amplify the signal you’re already sending: “I still plan to perform.”

Best fit:

* Men over \~30 who notice a real slide in drive, energy, and performance (in and out of the bedroom), but don’t necessarily need or want prescription TRT.​
* Guys who are willing to change habits and want a structured formula instead of random single herbs.

As always, it’s not a toy:

* Read the label.
* If you have heart issues, blood pressure problems, or take meds, talk to a doctor.​

Think of [this resource](https://mwebaro.com/11746/11183/3/) as backing up the work you’re doing on your environment, not a substitute for it.

# The mindset shift that actually changes things

For a long time, my internal script was:

“I just need to try harder.”

But after 30, “try harder” without “support your biology better” is a slow road to burnout and self‑loathing.

The shift that finally clicked was:

>

That means:

* Treating hormones and recovery as performance variables, not excuses.
* Training for the life you want ten years from now, not just for summer.
* Being willing to use tools *and* do the work, without shame in either.

The primary keyword here might be [men’s performance after 30, ](https://mwebaro.com/11746/11183/3/)but the real topic is ownership.​

You can’t stop time.

But you can absolutely stop drifting into a version of yourself that’s always tired, always “meh,” always talking about what you *used* to be capable of.

Nothing worked for me after 30…  
…until I took seriously the one thing that had been quietly driving everything all along.

Not motivation.  
Not hustle.

The system is running under the hood.

Hi everyone, I hope it’s okay to post this here, and that everyone is feeling more than okay(!)

I’ve felt how isolating modern life can get, even when you’re surrounded by people and social media.   
So I’ve been working on a simple, bootstrapped, completely free ""Offline Social Media"" called **Up Offline Social**, which helps people nearby meet in real life, for a coffee, a walk, a chat, play sports/games, or anything.

The idea is:  
• realtime, proximity base (think Pokemon Go but for making friends)  
• real-life connection > endless texting (you can't send texts or pics, just voice messages, GIFs, and contact details)  
• shared interests and goals  
• no ads  
• no selling data  
• safety features (a silent SOS panic button)

Basically, something more human and less addictive.

I’d really like to hear your perspective because this community understands loneliness better than most:  
• would something like this feel helpful… or stressful?  
• what would make it feel safe?  
• what would *stop* you from using it?

Any features or ideas that you'd like to see?  
  
What’s planned:  
\- Official offline locations & spontaneous hangout tools  
\- Slow, non-instant messaging (intentional message-in-a-bottle system)  
\- Interact and grow Bonsai trees with friends  
\- Light gamification: achievements, badges, XP, social hotspots in your area!  
\- Presence-centered features

Not trying to advertise, I just don’t want to build something tone-deaf.   
I really care about getting this right and helping you, and others like you.

Thanks for reading; sorry for the long post 💛

You can download and try it out on the App/Play Store! 🫡

I’m looking for advice from people who’ve scaled small food businesses or have operational experience.

Current setup:

We are two owner-operators (no employees)
Location: Tbilisi, Georgia
Total space: 13 m²
8 m² front / service
5 m² kitchen
5 seats outside only, takeaway only

What we do:
We roast our own coffee beans
Menu:
Coffee: ~15 items (including hand brew)
Grilled cheese: 9 variations
Fresh juice: 10 ingredients, customers can mix freely
Cinnamon rolls: 1 SKU, with cream cheese frosting

We work the shop ourselves day-to-day and are currently profitable, but we’re starting to feel the limits of time, space, and complexity.
What I’m trying to understand:

From a scalability point of view, what would you simplify or standardize first?
Is owner-operated scalability better achieved 

by:
Tightening the menu further?
Adding batch production (baking / prep days)?
Opening a second location with the same constraints?
At what point does adding staff make sense vs. staying lean and systemized?
Any red flags you see in this setup if the goal is 2–3 locations in the future?
I’m especially interested in practical, operational advice, not VC-scale growth — more like repeatable, small but solid expansion.

Im sitting at this little coffee shop trying to get some work done and theres these two older guys at the table next to me clearly been friends for decades based on how they talk to each other

Theyre arguing about what year some old movie came out. One of them is absolutely certain it was 1987 and hes going on about how he remembers seeing it in theaters the summer before his daughter was born. Very confident. Building his whole case around this memory

His buddy just quietly pulls out his phone and googles it. Turns the screen around. Doesnt say a word

First guy stares at it for a solid five seconds. Takes a long sip of his coffee. Then goes ""well the internet has been wrong before""

His friend just starts laughing so hard he almost spills his drink. First guy cracks a smile too and says ""fine but emotionally I was correct""

I had to pretend I was coughing so they wouldnt see me dying over here

Something about watching two old friends argue about the most pointless thing and then one of them just gracefully refusing to fully lose made my whole morning. This is the energy I want when Im that age",246,1767358379.0,CasualConversation,19,0.99,False

Before I met my husband I spend my life in temples and grew up with lots of discipline, meditations some light physical training. So low exposion to romance. My parents send me to study in Europe so I don’t go full monastic at 18. That’s when I also encounter modern dating culture for the first time. I don’t know what to do honestly. It was a bit of culture shock. I don’t know what to expect. I went limerent for 3 guys that took at least a year to get over them. I hate how immature I was, how I fantasize about them. I never confess, ghost those men, ate it up and distract myself with work. I speak multiple languages so I use that to do some part time work. That’s when I met my husband on some business event. He was 15 years older. He was very straight forward about wanting settle down. And I also thought when I date I don’t want to be casual. We agreed to meet for some coffee. It was calm, dry conversation. I don’t get butterflies, heartthrob and I felt clear in the head. 

He was also so grey and „boring“ ,a bit sleep deprived but seemed very stable overall , stable families , no traumas , no signs of any addiction , can handle his life like a highly functioning adult. I don’t need to mother him which I was scared off when i heard of some marriages. Only one thing , he was divorced and it’s was an emotional marriage which ends in drama. He won’t do it again, but will cater for everything else. Don’t expect romance. He has a very demanding job and is out of country 90% of the time. He is constantly jet lagged and tired too. 

We continue to talk a bit, I was a virgin back then and he didn’t push for anything , no stress no drama he is busy working. I don’t feel like a lovesick idiot with him. It was good but I was still unsure. 
But there was a moment I decided to marry him when the whole city was shock frozen, even trains and taxi refuse to drive. I called him at night he simply agreed to pick me up without a fuss and drive me home safely. I could rely on him I felt safe and so i agreed to get married. It was just signing the papers with our parents. I felt right because I don’t want to ever be limerent again. 

Fast forward I still don’t know what love in marriage is like and I became indifferent on love. We don’t date, we only go on vacations 1-2 times a year. He calls daily for a few min. about mundane stuff. I still truly can rely on him on everything , he is very pragmatic yet very capable of many things. I admire that about him. When I am in trouble which I am stupidly often he would solve it. Or if I want something he just get it or just make it happen. But he won’t initiate anything. I am not emotionally independent on him but I wonder if i am just became emotionally numb? I also noticed a rise of giving up on love among my friends who are still single because men nowadays are not good for them. But I also don’t dare do suggest doing the same thing as me I just listen and nod, they have never experienced limerence they have more grounded look on love than me. I believe they still can find a fulfilling love one day.

1q1xtz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q1xtz3/the_black_eyes/,The Black Eyes,"I have had trouble connecting with people for a long time. I was autistic in the early 2000s in Texas. The understanding of autism back then wasn’t as bad as it used to be, but it’s still laughably inept when compared to today. My elementary school principal forced me to be on medication for me to be allowed to attend school. We went through a handful of medications, almost all of which left me in some kind of zombified state. I guess that was a good result for my principal, whose method of dealing with autistic kids was to throw them in a corner and ignore them. However, it didn’t work for my mom, who fought tooth and nail for me to be allowed to go to school unmedicated. I was autistic, but I had it to a minor degree. However, my principal insisted I had to be on some kind of medication, hence why we went through so many. The final medicine I was on was some experimental thing. I don’t remember much about what I was like on that medicine, I just remember it caused me a major seizure that led to a week-long coma. The principal was fired shortly after that.

Now, before anyone gets the wrong idea: my autism isn’t why I have a hard time connecting with people. Sure, it didn’t help, but I know people who adjust quite well. No, what made it hard for me was that since the seizure, I can no longer see people’s eyes.

More accurately, I only see black voids where people’s eyes should be. I don’t even see my own eyes when I look in the mirror. Since I woke up from my coma, people were no longer human. All I saw were demons. I wasn’t great with eye-contact even before the seizure, but after I was actively avoiding it at all costs. My parents sent me to a therapist to try and figure out why I was so jumpy. Being locked in a room for an hour every week with a black-eyed monster staring me down and pretending to care left a mental scar on my emotional development. I never spoke a word during these meetings. I know my parents were just trying to help. This is the first time I’m telling anyone about my condition.

When I turned 19, I met a woman named Kenzie. For the first time since I was a child, I could see someone’s eyes. Kenzie’s were a beautiful golden hazel color, which accented her beautiful smile. We met at my first job. I was a dishwasher, and she was a waitress. She had a fiery personality and argued with the cooks a lot. However, she was very kind to me. She would thank me every time she would bring me an empty stack of plates. I was smitten with her. Whenever she shot that hypnotic smile my way, I would fall more and more in love.

It took almost six months for me to work up the courage to ask her on a date. To my absolute surprise, she accepted. During the lead up to our date, I had convinced myself that she didn’t think of this as a date, that we were just going out as friends. However, I was quickly proven wrong when I saw how she dressed for our outing. She wore fishnets, a short black dress, and combat books. Her make-up was flawless, her lips were painted a glossy pink, and her gorgeous eyes were surrounded in lavender eye-shadow and glitter. Her black hair, which she normally wore in a ponytail for work, was worn loose and cascaded down her shoulders.

She took my arm, holding me close. She was so warm. I forgot what I had planned for a bit. I remembered I was supposed to take her to see a movie. It was my mom’s suggestion. We went to see Avengers. I remember how much she was squealing during that scene Avengers assembled, and the camera circled around the group while the music swelled dramatically. I wish I could have enjoyed it as much as she did. I tried to match her enthusiasm, but I found it tricky. All the people on camera just looked like monsters to me. The only character I could connect with was Hulk. All the characters looked like monsters given my condition, but Hulk was a monster already so it ironically looked less terrifying from him. I guess that’s why I like the Hellraiser movies so much. The monsters look like monsters, so the eyes look normal for them.

After the movie, I took Kenzie home. She gave me my first kiss. I swear, my heart could have burst out of my chest when it happened. I could taste her lipstick for about an hour after the kiss, which turned out to be bubblegum. I found myself staring into her hazel eyes, basking in the intimate aura. This was something I never thought I would feel comfortable doing.

We dated for a few years before marrying in our mid-twenties. The service was small, with just our immediate family attending. On my side were my parents and my little brother, who was my best man. I honestly half-considered inviting no one. My condition had made my relationship with my family rather strained. On Kenzie’s side was just her older sister, who showed up to the event in ratty, smelly clothes. It looked like she hadn’t bathed in a while. During the afterparty, her sister seemed to spend most of the time at the buffet just scarfing down whatever she could, and pocketing everything else. I don’t remember Kenzie talking to her sister at any point except for shortly before she left.

We went to a small bed and breakfast for our honeymoon. I asked Kenzie about her sister. She explained her sister had some issues with drugs and was living on the streets. Kenzie stayed with my parents until she and I were able to find our own place. It was a rent-to-own house, two stories, with a nice back yard. It seemed way out of budget for the two of us, but Kenzie insisted she had it taken care of. Indeed, we never seemed to be late on our rent, and we never went hungry.

Every month, Kenzie would leave to visit her folks. It left me with some time to myself. I did enjoy some alone time, but I missed her dearly whenever she left. I asked how come she didn’t take me with her. To my shock, her lips went thin and her eyes twitched. She seemed positively livid for a split second before returning to her normal self. It was so bizarre. It was like she was an entirely different person. She told me that her parents were old fashioned and would hate my guts. That was enough for me. Besides, they would probably freak me out with their lack of eyes. Still, it was very odd so see Kenzie so angry, even if it was only for a short time. I hate to admit it, but I was rather scared of my wife.

Over the course of a few years, I noticed something strange. Once in a while I would see Kenzie just sitting on the couch staring at nothing. It would only last for a few moments at a time, but it sent chills down my spine, for when she spaced out like this, her eyes were voids just like everyone else. The most recent time I saw this happen, I tried approaching her. She looked up as I stepped forward. She scampered away like a frightened animal, locking herself in the bedroom. She came out a few moments later apologizing profusely. After this, she would spend an hour at night locked in the bedroom. Sometimes I could hear crying on the other end of the door.

For the longest time I thought this was normal. Afterall, given my condition, Kenzie was pretty much the only one who I could talk to. However, I started to feel like something was wrong. I tried doing my own research online about what was going on with Kenzie. I couldn’t find much about what could be the matter with the woman I loved. I wanted to help her, I wanted to make the hurt go away. I got the idea in my head that maybe something going on with her parents was what was wrong with her.

I know now what I did next was wrong. I’ve talked to people about it since then and they’ve explained what I did was honestly kind of messed up. However, I didn’t see it like that at the time. I hid a burner phone in her car when she went to visit her parents and used the GPS tracker to see where she went. I had an external battery pack on it so it wouldn’t run out of juice. I wanted to see where her parents lived so I could confront them on my own. I recognize now that this was an invasion of privacy. I wasn’t thinking about it like that. I just saw it as the next logical step.

She drove for a while. She was usually gone for a week at a time, and she spent the whole first day driving. They must have lived a long way away. That must have been why they didn’t attend our wedding. While she drove, I tried my best to find her sister online. I thought that maybe she would have some insights about what was happening with Kenzie. I know she was homeless, but I figured she may have used the computers at a library somewhere to maybe use social media, or try and find a job.

I realized I never got her sister’s name. I tried checking anyone who shared Kenzie’s maiden name, but couldn’t find her sister. Then again, the picture on her social media would probably be old and most likely before she became homeless so I wouldn’t recognize her. I checked a few women with the same last name, but none of them listed Kenzie as a sister. I gave up after searching online all day.

That night, I checked the GPS. To my surprise, the car was stopped by some woods. I searched online to see if there was a hotel or a retirement home out there. There was nothing. I watched as for three days the car remained stationary. I wondered if perhaps her parents were like those weird hermits who live off the grid you sometimes hear about. I thought about them living out there in a cabin and living off the land. It sounded a bit cool, but was not something I would want to do. Still, I had a destination.

Since Kenzie took care of the essentials, I had a fair bit of money saved up, even with my low-paying dishwashing job. I bought a ticket to some horror movie convention out of state. It was something I wanted to go to anyways and it gave me an excuse to leave the house alone when Kenzie came back. It was on the way and I planned on actually going so it wasn’t exactly lying, I was just leaving out the main reason I was heading out. She was a bit upset that I didn’t want to bring her along, but I told her I just wanted some time to myself. I promised her I would bring her along to the next convention. She was happy with that and began planning out what costume she would wear to it.

I packed my stuff and headed out, taking the route Kenzie had taken. I packed some hiking boots, some glow sticks and a flashlight. I didn’t imagine I would be at her parent’s house for very long. I had to figure out what was going on with Kenzie, I just hoped talking to them would help me along with that. I shuddered at the thought of their black eyes staring me down, but I continued regardless.

I reached the woods at about midnight. I had just gotten off the phone with Kenzie. She wanted to check up on me. I noticed a choked note in her voice as if she had just finished crying. I felt a knot in my stomach when I heard it. Part of me wondered if she was crying because of me. I know how much I missed her when she was gone, perhaps she was feeling the same for me. That made me anxious. I squirmed a bit in my seat as we spoke. I promised I would be back soon.

I stepped out of the car, shining the light around the trees. They looked pretty normal, so I wasn’t worried. They were just trees after all. As I delved further into the woods, I dropped glow sticks so that I could find my way back like Hansel and Gretel. I kept practicing what I would say when I reached my destination. I didn’t know where exactly this house would be. I just hoped the old man wouldn’t try shooting at me, or if he did then he would stop when he heard who I was. I kept an eye out for traps. I heard weird loners would keep traps to alert them of intruders. As expected, I found a trip wire hooked up to a contraption that would make a loud noise if I stepped on it. Maybe it would be a good idea for them to find me rather than the other way around.

I examined the trap a bit closer, checking to see if there was something that would shoot me if I stepped on it. Nope, it looked totally normal. I kneeled down, and yanked on the cord. The trap made a loud bang that echoed throughout the woods. My ears rang, I had forgotten to cover them in my stupidity. I just stood there and waited. I would call out as soon as I heard movement. I leaned against a tree, shining my flashlight upwards so they would see me easier. My heart raced as I waited, worried about meeting these people.

Every second felt like an hour. I kept checking the time on my phone. Ten minutes passed. I wondered if that loud noise didn’t wake them. I didn’t know how old they were, or how heavy of sleepers they were. I frankly knew nothing about them. I called out as loud as I could, trying to catch their attention. Still though, I got nothing. I decided to venture further in. I kept calling out as I walked, trying not to set off any other traps. I kept an ear out for any response.

Eventually, I reached a small hut. It looked rather rickety, and poorly taken care of. It smelled awful. I wondered if the place was partly put together with dung, I know some places used that as a legit building material. I doubted any inspectors would approve of this place. The house was surrounded by a wire fence with wooden posts. The posts were covered in fungus and looked rotten. As I drew closer, I smelled a lot of rust. Surely these people would have woken up by now. I was a flashlight right at their house. They had to have been awake by now. I called out. There was no response.

I knocked on the door. I was wondering if the place was abandoned. However, I didn’t know what Kenzie would be doing out here if that was the case. I shone the flashlight into a cracked window of the hut. All I could see was broken furniture and cobwebs. It didn’t look like anyone lived here. However, it did look like someone was here recently. There were clear spots in the dust on the floor and some of the cobwebs were hanging loose as if they had been pulled out of someone’s way. My mind was racing, wondering just what Kenzie did out here. The traps were maintained rather well. If no one lived out here, that meant Kenzie had to have been the one dealing with the traps.

I half considered going inside to explore. However, I didn’t really want Kenzie knowing I was here. A single trap going off could be explained by either mechanical failure or an animal. However, me going in there would definitely leave some signs someone was here. Perhaps she would think her sister was here, she was homeless after all. This would be a convenient place to sleep. I was just about to move to the door to open it when I saw something that made my stomach sink. There was blood on the floor. It looked like a smear mark, like something had been dragged. I followed the smear with my flashlight. The smear ended suddenly at what I assumed was a trap door. I could see a rusted handle.

I rushed to the car and called the police. I told them what hotel I would be going to and waited for an officer to meet me there. From the hotel I was taken to a police station to answer questions. They didn’t tell me what was going on, but they seemed deadly serious. I told them everything, including the admittedly creepy part where I tracked my wife. I would have made up something to cover up that part but I couldn’t think of a reasonable excuse as to how I knew about the hut.

They left me in the interrogation room for a few hours until one of the officers sat across from me to explain what was going on. There were several corpses under the trap door, all of which had human bite marks. My heart sank into my stomach as the realization that my world was falling apart hit me. The only woman I could truly connect with was a monster. I didn’t want to believe my love was so evil. I felt the color fade from my cheeks and I locked eyes with the officer. This act was instinctive. Even with the officer’s blackened eyes, I could see a softness in his expression. He seemed sympathetic to me.

He asked if I wanted to talk to Kenzie so I could get some closure. I don’t know if something like that was standard procedure but I didn’t think too much about that. I agreed, wanting to hear from her. She was led into the interrogation room, her hands and feet were cuffed. Tears were streaming down her cheeks, and her eyes were pitch black. She was chained to her chair so she couldn’t escape or try to attack me. Kenzie didn’t squirm. She didn’t respond to my questions, she just sat there. After a few minutes, she smiled at me. Her chin was trembling. She seemed almost relieved.

I began to scream and berate her. I needed to know why she did what she did. I needed to know who she really was. That woman in that room wasn’t the woman who I fell in love with. I didn’t know who she was. I had to be pulled out of the room as I kicked and squirmed. They took me to the waiting area for me to relax for a few minutes. One of the female officers asked if I wanted coffee to help me relax. She squeezed my shoulder gently, trying to make me feel more comfortable. Police station coffee is notoriously bad, but it was better than nothing. I nodded in agreement, before looking up at her. Her eyes were a golden hazel. She gave me a little smirk and a wink.

1q1xtvv,https://i.redd.it/43mb8mainxag1.png,My Family Scored My Love? I Scored Their DOWNFALL—Fair Trade,"Chapter 1  
  
  
""Megan, get over here.""  
  
  
In the living room, my parents sat on the couch like kings on thrones. A document lay on the coffee table.  
  
  
Family Love Score Management Agreement.  
  
  
My heart STOPPED.  
  
  
I was back. Back to the day this nightmare started.  
  
  
My fiancé Marcus shot me a worried look and squeezed my freezing hand.  
  
  
I was alive. I could feel his warmth—not the cold beeping of ICU machines.  
  
  
Terror and rage churned in my chest.  
  
  
Mom cleared her throat, that fake-generous smile plastered on her face:  
  
  
""For family harmony—and to keep things fair between you and Ryan—your father and I decided to quantify your love with a point system.""  
  
  
Ryan looked up from his phone in the corner, smirking:  
  
  
""Yeah, Megan. Think of it as motivation. Stop forgetting who you OWE.""  
  
  
Owe? Last life I remembered TOO well—and you bloodsuckers picked me CLEAN.  
  
  
Marcus's jaw tightened. He started to speak up for me, but I grabbed his arm.  
  
  
Last time he fought for me, Dad pointed in his face and screamed he was ""driving a wedge in our family before he's even married in.""  
  
  
I'd cried and begged him to stop.  
  
  
Not this time.  
  
  
I walked over calmly and picked up the agreement.  
  
  
""Sure. Let me see it.""  
  
  
They froze—then relaxed, satisfied.  
  
  
Mom thought she HAD me. She started reading out the rules, all smug:  
  
  
""Rule one: Turn over your FULL paycheck on payday. That's 100 points. Late? Minus 20 per day.  
  
  
I'll manage the money for household expenses and Ryan's future.""  
  
  
""Rule two: Proactively meet Ryan's needs—phones, game consoles, designer sneakers. Five to fifty points depending on cost. Refuse? Minus 100.""  
  
  
Ryan was kicking his feet, scrolling through pics of a $30K sports car.  
  
  
""Rule three: All holidays you stay home—cooking, cleaning, hosting relatives. Miss one? Minus 200.""  
  
  
""Rule four: Home by 10 p.m. No sleepovers with men. Break it once? Minus 150 and write a confession letter.""  
  
  
I smiled. ""Wow. You two really thought of everything. I'm TOTALLY on board.""  
  
  
Dad nodded, all high and mighty:  
  
  
""Megan, sweetie, this is for your own good. Girls can't handle money—you'll mess up. We'll take care of it for the family.""  
  
  
""Right, sis. Better score high this time. Stop being in the red."" Ryan grinned.  
  
  
I picked up the pen, looking at their smug faces.  
  
  
""I'll sign right now.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
The pen hovered over the paper. I stopped.  
  
  
""Wait.""  
  
  
My mom Linda's face twisted. ""What game are you playing NOW?""  
  
  
I looked up, all innocent smiles.  
  
  
""Mom, the agreement's great. But if we want it FAIR, shouldn't everyone have clear rights and responsibilities?""  
  
  
""I just think we need a few extra clauses.""  
  
  
""Extra what?"" Dad's tone was already sharp with irritation.  
  
  
I took my time.  
  
  
""Amendment One: If this is a Family Love Score Agreement, then EVERY family member should be in the point system.  
  
  
Testing just me? That's not family management. That's employee performance reviews.""  
  
  
I watched their faces freeze. Kept going.  
  
  
""For example—Mom and Dad make me a nice meal? Five points. Take care of me when I'm sick for a day? Twenty points. Clean my room for me? Ten points.""  
  
  
""Everyone earns scores. THAT'S family harmony.""  
  
  
Mom's face went dark. Her voice shot up:  
  
  
""We raised you your WHOLE LIFE, and now you want POINTS for a meal?! Megan, do you have NO conscience?!""  
  
  
""Mom, calm down,"" I said soothingly.  
  
  
""Isn't this YOUR system for quantifying love? Doesn't your effort deserve to be tracked and valued?""  
  
  
Before she could snap back, I turned to Dad and Ryan. Dropped the second bomb.  
  
  
""Amendment Two: If points can be quantified, they should work like family currency.  
  
  
You earn them. You SPEND them.""  
  
  
I flipped through the agreement.  
  
  
""Says here I can't visit Marcus's family on holidays, or lose 200 points.""  
  
  
""So if I earn 200 points, I can BUY the right to spend a holiday at his place.""  
  
  
""Or—Ryan wants the latest phone, and I refuse? Minus 100 points. Fine. I'll use 100 points to buy a refusal pass.""  
  
  
""RIDICULOUS!"" Dad slammed the table, face black with rage.  
  
  
Ryan jumped off the couch, pointing at me and screaming:  
  
  
""Megan! When did you get so petty?!""  
  
  
""I'm your BROTHER! You're supposed to buy me stuff—you want to charge POINTS for that?!""  
  
  
I dropped the smile. My eyes went ice-cold as I stared him down. Then I turned to my parents.  
  
  
""Weren't you the ones who said points make everything fair?""  
  
  
""Or does this system only exist to control me, exploit me—while doing nothing to protect my basic rights?""  
  
  
""If that's the case, where's the fairness you keep talking about?""  
  
  
""You… you…""  
  
  
Mom pointed at me, shaking all over, unable to get a word out.  
  
  
""Megan, what happened to you?! You weren't like this before!""  
  
  
Ryan was still yelling, like I'd committed some crime against humanity.  
  
  
I looked at him, stone-cold. ""I'm just learning to follow the rules YOU made.""  
  
  
That shut them all up.  
  
  
Dead silence filled the room.  
  
  
They stared at me—shock and FURY burning in their eyes.  
  
  
Finally, desperate to lock me down with this agreement—and get their hands on my paycheck—they forced the words through clenched teeth.  
  
  
""FINE. Add your damn clauses.""  
  
  
Mom glared at me like she could kill me with her eyes, as if to say, Even with these amendments, you'll never escape my palm.  
  
  
I smiled. Picked up the pen. Wrote down those extra lines in neat handwriting, then signed my name with a flourish.  
  
  
They had no idea—the second THEY signed their names, the game became MINE to control.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Back in my room, the second the door clicked shut, Marcus couldn't hold back anymore. He pulled me into his arms—tight.  
  
  
His chest was heaving. His voice cracked with fury and heartbreak.  
  
  
""Megan... why did you agree to that? Why sign something that's gonna crush you?""  
  
  
That familiar warmth—it shattered every wall I'd built.  
  
  
Last life flashed back—the ICU machines, their cold calculations over my dying body, the way they'd already divided up my assets.  
  
  
Tears flooded out. I buried my face in his chest, body shaking.  
  
  
""I'm fine, honey. Really. I'm... fine...""  
  
  
But I wasn't. I hated myself—hated how stupid I'd been. How weak.  
  
  
Marcus cupped my face, thumbs brushing away tears.  
  
  
""Megan, stop. We're DONE with this. Pack your stuff. Move back to your place. Or come to mine.""  
  
  
""I don't have much saved, but it's enough for both of us. We leave. Right now. No more of their shit.""  
  
  
His offer warmed something deep inside me. But my mind was already replaying the rest.  
  
  
I'd worked myself half to death to afford a small condo and a car.  
  
  
Then Mom and Dad showed up with their ""girls marry out anyway—everything you own is Ryan's"" speech. Forced me to drain every account to cover Ryan's failed business debts.  
  
  
Threatened to sue me. Said the house and car were ""technically theirs,"" just in my name. They'd ""legally reclaim"" them for Ryan.  
  
  
One time I refused to buy Ryan some overpriced sneakers. Mom called me an ""ungrateful snake"" and banned me from dinner for a month. Said I needed to ""reflect.""  
  
  
The car I saved up for? Ryan took it whenever he wanted. Didn't even ask.  
  
  
He totaled it street racing. My parents didn't scold him—they blamed ME for buying ""a flimsy car"" that ""almost got their baby boy hurt.""  
  
  
I had a cavity filled. Didn't replace the tooth right away because I couldn't justify the cost. Years later, I finally spent $20K on an implant.  
  
  
Dad found out. smashed the TV remote. screamed in my face.  
  
  
""You selfish brat! Ryan's wedding, his house—where's that money supposed to come from?!""  
  
  
""Every dollar you waste on yourself is stolen from your brother's future! Do you have NO conscience?!""  
  
  
I'd bent. Over and over. Believed blood was thicker than water. Believed they'd see me someday.  
  
  
What I got? Their cold arithmetic as I lay dying. Their greedy eyes on my leftover assets.  
  
  
I clenched my fists so hard my nails bit into my palms. The pain kept me sharp.  
  
  
I hated my past self. Hated them more.  
  
  
Marcus saw the cold fury in my eyes. He stopped trying to convince me to leave.  
  
  
He just held me tighter. Voice low and steady.  
  
  
""Okay, Megan. Whatever you're planning—I'm with you. Always.""  
  
  
I looked up at him, eyes still wet but clear.  
  
  
""Marcus, your money is yours. This time, I don't need your help.""  
  
  
""I'm taking back everything that was mine. Using their rules.""  
  
  
Marcus thought I was just venting. Trying to prove a point.  
  
  
He had no idea. I wasn't after a point.  
  
  
I was after BLOOD.

I'm working on understanding the challenges in emergency medicine, particularly around patient care, workflow, and communication during critical situations.

I'm looking to speak with:

* Emergency medicine residents or doctors
* Paramedics or EMTs
* Anyone working in hospital emergency departments

**What I'm asking for:** Just 15-20 minutes of your time (in person over coffee, or a quick call) to understand:

* What are the biggest pain points you face daily?
* What tools/processes work well vs. don't work?
* What would make your job easier or patients safer?

I'm not selling anything - genuinely trying to learn from people on the ground before pursuing any solutions.

If you're in emergency medicine or know someone who is, I'd really appreciate the conversation. Happy to work around your schedule.

Please feel free to DM me!

Last April is when I decided to quit nicotine for good; I was having to many health issues such as heart palpitations, weird aches and pains and absolutely no energy. I was only using 3mgs and the withdrawal while rough, was at least brief. Since then, I've had a few cravings here and there, but at this point I can pretty much just laugh them off and tell myself ""that's not something we do anymore"" . 

That summer, I was still having some other issues, and after doing a reality check realized it was probably from excessive drinking. I have this thing where the day after I would drink, even small amounts, my anxiety was through the roof, like worrying about insane things with little to no grounding in reality. Amazingly, when I stopped drinking, that level of worry went away and I just started to feel 'better'.

Now for the final one, when I quit nicotine, I started using cannabis more regularly, to the point it was more nights then not. I do think it helped me get through my nicotine dependence and then later my drinking, and I would suggest that if someone lives somewhere that's it legal it might be worth at least looking into. Some would say its just switching vices, and while I'm inclined to agree, I did notice that I was able to easily go without it if I had to such as traveling. If I ever ran into a situation where I couldn't get nicotine I was miserable (withdrawal), and if I went to an event where there was no booze I would also be grumpy; with thc it was just a ""it would be nice, but whatever"" thought.

That said, after some soul searching and coming to grips with my baseline anxiety and learning what thc does to the brain, I decided I am going to abstain from thc for awhile and then reevaluate my usage. After a week without it and not really missing it the way I thought I would, I'm already thinking it might become a very rare thing I do. 

All this is to say, I'm here Jan 2nd and after having a good night's sleep, I'm just drinking my coffee (I drink one cup a day and no I'm not getting rid of that and yes I get the irony of it) and I'm feeling so great I have a few happy tears in my eyes. It's been so long since I haven't had some mind altering substance controlling me and I just feel like I have a second chance now to be present for life.",2,1767357923.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False
1q1xp2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1q1xp2y/cracking_the_hermit_kingdom_a_foreigner_on_how_to/,Cracking the Hermit Kingdom. A Foreigner on How to Get the Most out of Korea,"https://daysofbeingmild.substack.com/p/cracking-the-hermit-kingdom

I am writing this guide to help foreign travelers get the most out of Korea. Having traveled around the world and in spite of my elementary Korean language capabilities, few countries were as difficult to unlock as Korea. In this guide I will try to share some of what I learned living in Korea for 3 years (2021-2024). It should serve as a non-comprehensive primer to help you get the most out of Korea beyond what is available on superficial western-facing travel guides.

Apps
Korea’s tech economy is highly protectionist. They have their own app ecosystem which can often be unfriendly to English speakers. As such, foreign (American) apps generally do not perform as well in Korea or with Korean language. Familiarizing yourself with the Korean app ecosystem is the first step in unlocking what Korea has to offer.

Maps. Naver maps is far better than Google maps in Korea. Naver maps (or alternatively Kakao Maps) is a prerequisite for all of the below. I will include the Korean for many of my recommendations below because the naver maps search function is generally better in Korean than English. High foot traffic areas are shown in orange like Google maps.

Translator. Native Korean speakers tell me Naver Papago is a better translator than Google Translate although I’m sure Google can get the job done 95% percent of the time. One useful feature is the respectfulness toggle. You can toggle the “honorific” form off / on which as of this writing was not a feature in Google Translate. Rule of thumb: if you don’t know whether you should use honorific or casual language you should probably use “honorific”.

Chat. Kakaotalk. Your Korean friends (or in-laws) will use Kakaotalk as their primary means of communication. If you ask a Korean for their Kakaotalk info and they say they don’t have it, they are not interested in you.

Air Quality. Airvisual. Korea has an unfortunate smog (fine dust / “misaemeonji”) problem. Depending on when you visit Korea, the smog could be anywhere from “not noticeable” to “debilitating”. Airvisual provides a good, local forecast. I highly recommend avoiding exercise on a bad smog day.

Rideshare. Kakaotaxi (dependent on a Kakaotalk account) for ride-hailing. Uber is new-ish to Korea and the local app is sometimes faster and cheaper.

Transportation
Cabs are significantly cheaper than in the US. A one hour ride will cost approximately $35.

Cars. Despite a somewhat bad reputation, I didn’t find Korean drivers to be significantly more aggressive than most American drivers. Traffic, unfortunately, can be exceptionally bad. During rush hour, travel time can triple (or more). Furthermore, weekend traffic for those leaving Seoul to the south or returning from the south makes car travel extremely difficult. There are no police speed traps but there are a significant number of speed cameras. Speeding tickets are almost guaranteed unless you are seriously attentive to speed limit changes and camera locations. Fortunately, unless you speed in a school zone, you likely won’t pay more than $30 for your ticket.

Public Regional / Commuter Buses. The major highways feature dedicated regional bus lanes, which allow you to bypass heavy traffic for the majority of your trip. The buses are all clean, especially compared to their disgusting American counterparts, Unlike the regional trains where you may be forced to stand uncomfortably for an hour, you have a guaranteed soft seat. Depending on where you live / will stay this can be the best way to travel to / from the airport. The Bus Rapid Transit system is a legacy of mayor and future President Lee Myung-Bak’s transportation reforms.

Subways / Regional Trains. Seoul has an extensive, clean subway system. It’s usually the easiest and fastest way to travel within Seoul especially during high traffic times (most of the time).

High speed trains. Can be the preferred mode of transport to Busan, Daegu, Jeolla.

The “T-Money” card. The easiest, most universal way to use public transportation in Korea. You can buy or recharge one at convenience stores or in metro stations.

Food
Korean cuisine is far more diverse than American Korean restaurants might lead you to believe. Although you’ll be able to find the Korean-American staples: BBQ (samgyeopsal), Bibimbap, Bulgogi and Fried (Yangnyeom) Chicken there is a whole other world left to uncover that can be harder to find in the US. Below is just a small selection of dishes to diversify your Korean food repertoire.

Haemultang 해물탕. Fish soup.

Dalkgalbi 닭갈비. Cooked-at-table chicken stir-fry.




Bossam 보쌈. Fatty pork served with veggies wraps

Pyongyang naengmyeon 평양냉면 or kongguksu 콩국수 are popular, served cold summer noodle dishes.




Naengmyeon 냉면

Samgyetang 삼계탕. ginseng chicken soup

“Chinese Food”. Like much of Chinese-American cuisine, the food Koreans refer to as “Chinese food” is not made up of dishes a Chinese person would claim. That said, all of the dishes listed below are incredibly popular throughout Korea, and each has at least some historical narrative linking its origins to China.

Lamb Skewers양꼬치




Gamjatang 감자탕. Literally “potato soup,” but typically includes large pieces of pork bone and meat.” One of my favorite Korean dishes.




Jjajangmyeon 짜장면 (black bean sauce noodles) and jjampong 짬뽕 (spicy seafood stew) are both common cheap fast food / takeout options.

Eating alone “Honbab” (혼밥) culture. Unlike Japan and the US, eating alone is unusual in Korea. Many restaurants will make solo eaters feel at best, like losers, and at worse like inconveniences. For one, dining out is generally viewed as a social activity, making a solo diner seem more conspicuous or out of place. Two, Korean restaurants are generous with their free side dishes (banchan 반찬). Part of the Korean restaurant business model is that those free dishes will be split between 2+ people. They are a fixed cost per table. The restaurant owner’s perception is that the revenue earned through the 1 diner does not offset that fixed cost.

“Kimbab” restaurants “김밥” and fast food chains are usually good for eating alone. You may find luck with other restaurants as well but where you can comfortably eat alone and where you cannot is generally more of a vibe than a rule. You may get a sense after a couple of days where you are welcome and where you are not.

Street Food

“Soondae” (순대) - blood sausage

“Tteokbokki” (떡볶이) - spicy rice cakes

“Twikim” (튀김) - fried stuff

“Eomuk” (어묵) - fish cake

“Heotdeok” (호떡) - a hot syrupy donut type thing. Typically sold in the winter.




International Food

If you are in Korea for long enough to branch out beyond Korean food, the most interesting and diverse international restaurants are in the neighborhoods historically and currently outside the walk-in gates of the largest American military bases: Itaewon and Pyeongtaek respectively. Each has good options for American BBQ (better than you can find in New York or California), something approximating Mexican cuisine, varieties of middle eastern cuisine, South African cuisine etc. Outside of these multicultural hubs, upscale areas in Seoul also offer strong international options, including Japanese cuisine.

Seoul Neighborhood Guide.
I generally organize my travel by areas I can walk contiguously before needing another mode of transport. Below I’ve grouped Seoul neighborhoods by walkability.

Central Seoul
Gwanghwamun 광화문. Locus of central Seoul. Think Times Square.

Myeongdong 명동. Central, shopping area (usually mid-tier international brands). Cool street food market throughout. Underground market (link) as well.

Namdaemun 남대문. central, older style (‘80s) market with crafts and street food. This is a fun set of interconnected building if you need a goal.

Insadong 인사동. traditional shopping area like Asakusa in Tokyo, some tourist trap shops, some legit artists / collectors.

Bukchon hanok village 북촌 한옥 마을. traditional “hanok-style” architecture neighborhood. People, usually girls, dress up in old-fashioned “hanbok” and walk around to take pictures




Sejong Village Food Street 세종 마을 & Ikseondong 익석동. both walkable from central area.

Dongdaemun Design Plaza 동대문 디자인 플라자. A futuristic, curved architectural landmark known for its unique design and cultural exhibitions.

Hongdae Station and Surroundings
Hongdae 홍대. College party neighborhood. Lots of good, cheap food and bars. Highest energy neighborhood. Young crowd (16-24?)

Yeonnamdong 연남동. Slightly older crowd than hongdae (23-35?) , slightly quieter but a more comfy feel. Also good shops / restaurants.

Area between Noksapyeong to Hangangjin Stations
Itaewon 이태원. foreigner “waygugin” 외국인 (you probably if you are reading this) neighborhood. The historical location of the walk-in gate for US military base USAG Yongsan i.e. where the US Soldiers could bar crawl until their curfew. It became the cultural gateway to the west. Although now located in the center of Seoul, this base was originally occupied by the Japanese Army and was located on the outskirts of the city before the city’s massive growth. The US took their place after WW2. It served as the primary HQ of the American military presence for over half a century. That military presence has gradually moved southward to Pyeongtaek (Camp Humphreys), now the largest US military installation outside of the US and Yongsan has been almost entirely abandoned minus the Dragon Hill Lodge Hotel and some embassy housing. Another essay (or book) could be written about the history of USAG Yongsan but I’ll call it outside the scope of this guide.




Hannamdong 한남동. Next to Itaewon. Rich neighborhood. Upscale shopping, embassies.

Haebongchon 해방촌 신흥시장. Hidden market place tucked into the side of the hill above USAG Yongsan.

Gangnam 강남.
A common misperception among Americans is that Gangnam is one neighborhood. It literally means “south of the river” and similar to the Rive Gauche or Brooklyn it covers a massive area consisting of hundreds of neighborhoods. I’ll just highlight a couple. You should take a cab or public transportation between each. There are many plastic surgery clinics in each of these neighborhoods.

Sinsa 신사. Upscale shopping / clubs.

Apgujeong Rodeo 압구정 로데오. Upscale shopping. Also lively with high foot traffic and good restaurants / bars.

Sinnonhyeon 신논현. Gangnam Station. One block off the main road to east or west. The liveliest but slightly dirty area of Gangnam.

Jamsil / Lotte World 잠실 롯데월드. Part indoor, part outdoor theme park in the middle of the city.




Yeouido 여의도. Political / business center of Korea.

Seongsu 성수. Seoul forest 서울숲 to Konkuk University Station.
Seongsu 성수. The Williamsburg (NYC) of Seoul. Hipster type shops and cafes. Seoul forest is a nice park adjacent to Seongsu.

Outside of Seoul
1 hour

Suwon 수원

Suwon Hwaseong Fortress 수원 화성. Main touristy area with a fortress wall / walking trail and traditional style town.

PaldalMun Market 팔달문시장. Fun market to explore.

Gwanggyo Lake Park 광교호수공원. Nice suburban area of Suwon (but with skyscrapers bc it’s Korea)




Everland 에버랜드. Bigger theme park (than Lotte World). Outside of the city. Has a zoo. Full of flowers (Wisteria/ Sakura) in March.

Dongtan 동탄. The greatest city in all of Korea and also the author’s former home. It is being rapidly built out and expanded so it will be significantly different in the coming years. Dongtan 1 has “Dongtan Central Park” and Dongtan 2 has the Lotte Mall. Dongtan Lake Park and the Lake Como mall are also nice.




Incheon

Songdo 송도. International business district with expansive mall called Triple Street

Busan. More southeast asia feel. Narrow chaotic streets, dirtier, cheaper, hotter than Seoul. Maybe better for travel than Seoul depending on your tastes but I am unqualified to guide.

3 hours by car

Gangwon-do Mountains. Good for skiing or a Korean countryside feel.

Pyeongchang. Site of Olympics

Seoraksan. typical Seoul Koreans’ weekend mountain getaway destination.

Jeonju. Traditional village with a local “Jeolla” identity.

Etc.
IgoBart. Recommended Dutch Youtuber who explores a variety of Seoul neighborhoods in his “Welcome to my Dong” series.

Hangul. Korean Script. By devoting a couple of hours, you can learn to read the Korean phonetic alphabet thanks to King Sejong’s reforms on the inherited non-phonetic Chinese character set. This can come in handy - even on a short trip. It may also just enhance your experience exploring a new culture.




This coffee shop is hidden in a back alley in Euljiro. It is adorned with beautiful mother of pearl artwork and giant exotic fish.

Gwangjang Sijang 광장시장. Typical, albeit touristy, central korean market specializing in savory pancakes (pajeon) and blood sausage (soondae).




Shopping for Asian art / antiquey stuff is significantly cheaper here vs Japan if that’s your thing. Some places where you might find it: Hoehyeon underground market, insadong, hannamdong, namdaemun.

Jjimjilbang 찜질방. Korean version of a Japanese onsen / public bath house.
They usually have clothed coed spaces and single gender bathing areas. The coed spaces will have good cheap food and it is customary to drink SikHye (식혜), a sweet rice drink, after your steam. Overnight stays are often an option, offering a budget-friendly alternative to a hotel, especially if you need a flexible sleeping arrangement due to jet lag or simply aren’t too concerned about luxury.
Closer to Hongdae. Closer to Gangnam. Also near Hongdae. Very old fashioned and feels like a trip in a time machine.




Screen Golf. cheaper, easier, more diverse and more common in Korea than in America. There is usually a shop within walking distance in most large metro areas. I would get 30 minutes on the “driving range” and “18 holes” for $7. They usually have club rental options and beer too. “Golfzone Park” (골프존 파크) is a popular chain.

Korea has a lot of nice malls often featuring nice food courts. Especially useful when the weather is bad and you want to escape the elements (i.e. most of the summer and most of the winter).",9,1767357913.0,koreatravel,6,0.74,False

**Don’t let its simplicity fool you; The Ceado Hoop is an amazing brewer.**

# The Hoop has every attribute of a great manual dripper:

* **Requires little-to-no skill**
* **Requires little barista attention (this is especially valuable to cafes)**
* **Offers low risk of astringency**
* **Makes even extractions easy to produce**
* **Offers almost automatic consistency**

# Just pour the water in the outer ring, walk away, and 3–4 minutes later, you have incredible filter coffee.

# Like the Pulsar, Tricolate, and Filter3, The Hoop is a no-bypass brewer, which means astringency is easy to avoid, and The Hoop produces high extractions using a relatively coarse grind. The small-diameter brewing chamber provides a deeper bed than most no-bypass brewers.

# The genius of The Hoop lies in the allowing the barista to pour all of the water at once, while limiting the height of the slurry.

# THE HOOP: $35

# Each Hoop comes with a pack of 100 filter papers. The standard filters require a coarse grind to yield the recommended 4:00 brew time.

# I offer optional upgraded filters as an add-on for those who want to use a finer grind to achieve higher extractions with excellent flavor clarity, in the same 4:00 brew time.

# After you purchase The Hoop, I will send you my personal “how to” guide to The Hoop",0,1767357729.0,FreshroastSR800,0,0.5,False

He lives two hours away and reached out to me first. While traveling for the holidays, he went out of his way to have coffee with me on Christmas Eve, I got mixed signals, but then he initiated dinner for a second date. He drove in terrible weather, we had a lot of fun, he was making a lot of comments about having to buy a faster car to come see me, (“if I have a girlfriend I’m gonna wanna get here fast”), said he was surprised nobody had “wifed” me up yet etc. My messages were also probably a bit mixed because I’m not sure about him yet. He initiated kissing at the end of the night, we kissed again, then he went to leave with a vague “I’ll text you.” I questioned “oh you’ll text me?” And he said “well I don’t really have anything going on for New Year’s. I’d rather spend it with you, you can pick a place, I’ll drive here.” He said it in this cutesy voice. I was a little confused because I’d told him on the date I had NYE plans with my girlfriends. It was left in that vague way, we texted briefly when he got home. The next day I started the convo but didn’t talk about the date or mention moving anything forward. Toward the end of the day he kinda flatly texted that he was staying in his town because a friend of his friend was throwing a party. I responded “that’s cool, we just figured out our plans today too.”

That was 2 days ago and nothing. I should just let it die, yeah? I’m iffy on him anyway and it’s not a big deal but he’s an odd one.

1q1xj2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1q1xj2s/i_helped_a_crying_guy_at_the_laundromat_months/,I helped a crying guy at the laundromat months ago and today he helped me back without hesitation,"The laundromat near my apartment is one of those places that always feels slightly sad. Not tragic sad, just fluorescent lighting, plastic chairs, the smell of warm detergent, and people staring at spinning clothes like theyre waiting for their life to do something.

I go there on Sundays because my buildings washer likes to break at the worst times. It was late afternoon, raining outside, and I was doing laundry with the same energy I do everything lately. Functional, quiet, dont think too much.

I had my headphones in and a basket on my hip, loading the machine when I noticed him. A guy around my age sitting on the far end hunched over like he was trying to fold himself into the chair.

He kept wiping his face with his sleeve.

At first I assumed allergies. Then I heard the sound, not sobbing, not loud crying, just that tight shaky breathing people do when theyre trying to cry silently so nobody can tell.

I did the normal thing, I looked away. Because in public youre supposed to pretend you dont see people falling apart.

But then I saw his hands, he was holding his phone like it was useless, like it had died at the worst moment. He stared at the screen, pressed something, then dropped it into his lap and covered his face.

And before I could talk myself out of it I walked over and said quietly,

""Hey, are you okay? Do you need to call someone?""

He looked up fast, embarrassed, like hed been caught. His eyes were red and he tried to smile which made it worse.

""My phone got cut off,"" he said, voice cracking. ""Im trying to call my mom, I just need to hear her voice for a second.""

Then he said this and it hit me right in the chest because it was so specific:

""I dont even need her to fix anything, I just need someone to sound like home.""

I stood there holding my laundry basket like an idiot because I knew that feeling. Not the exact situation but that sentence, the need for one voice to make you feel less lost.

So I pulled out my phone. ""Use mine.""

He blinked. ""No its okay, I dont want to—""

""Seriously, its fine.""

He hesitated like he was deciding whether he deserved it then took my phone with both hands like it was something fragile.

He went outside under the awning because it was still raining and I sat back down pretending to scroll, pretending I wasnt listening.

But when people talk to someone they love you can hear it even when you dont mean to. His voice changed the second someone answered, it got softer.

""Hi Mom,"" and you could almost hear him unclench.

Then after a pause he whispered ""Im okay, I just needed a minute.""

When he came back in he handed my phone back like it was a gift and kept saying thank you like he didnt know how else to hold himself together.

I shrugged it off the way people do because making it emotional feels embarrassing. ""No worries, weve all had days.""

He nodded really hard like that sentence mattered. Then he looked at me. ""Im Daniel.""

I told him my name.

We didnt become friends, didnt exchange numbers, didnt do the ""we should totally hang out"" thing. He went back to his laundry, I went back to mine.

But when I left I kept thinking about that line. ""I just need someone to sound like home.""

A few months passed.

Then one evening after work I stopped at the same little grocery store near the laundromat. Id had one of those days where nothing catastrophic happens but everything feels heavy anyway. My boss had been weird, the train was late, I spilled coffee on my sleeve, my brain was stuck in a loop of ""youre messing everything up"" for no good reason.

I wasnt crying but I was close.

I was standing in the checkout line staring at gum trying to breathe normally when the cashier said my total and I reached for my wallet.

And it wasnt there.

I froze. Checked my pockets, my bag, the other pocket I already checked, my coat. Nothing.

My face went hot so fast. I could feel the people behind me shifting, the line tightening around my panic.

I stammered ""Im sorry I think I left my wallet at home.""

The cashier gave me that tired look. ""I can set it aside.""

And I know thats a normal solution but in that moment it felt like the last straw, like my body had been waiting all day for permission to fall apart.

I stood there holding my groceries trying not to cry in front of strangers over a wallet.

Then a voice behind me said ""Hey.""

Not loud, just close.

I turned and saw him. Daniel.

Same face, same calm eyes. He looked at me for a second and his expression softened like he recognized the feeling not just me.

He didnt ask a bunch of questions, didnt make it a scene. He just stepped forward, tapped his card on the reader and said to the cashier ""Ive got it.""

I stared at him. ""No, absolutely not.""

He shook his head once, gentle but firm. ""You let me borrow your phone.""

And then he smiled just a little and said the exact kind of line that makes your throat tighten:

""You sounded like home that day.""

I stood there blinking like an idiot because my brain was trying to decide whether I was allowed to accept kindness without earning it.

""I can pay you back.""

He waved it off. ""Dont worry about it, just keep doing what you did.""

That was the whole payoff. Not a big speech, not an exchange of numbers, not a dramatic hug. Just a small gesture that turned my worst moment of the day into something survivable.

We walked out at the same time. The rain had stopped and the sidewalk was shiny.

He nodded toward the laundromat. ""I still go Sundays.""

I laughed because of course he did.

""My moms doing better by the way.""

""Good,"" I said and I meant it.

We stood there for a second in that awkward almost friend space, then he gave a quick wave and headed down the street. I went the other way.

And I dont know if this is cheesy but on the walk home I kept thinking how strange it is that you can be a completely normal person in a completely ordinary place and still end up being the thing that keeps someone together for five minutes.

Sometimes its not grand, sometimes its just a phone call under an awning, sometimes its a card tap at a checkout, sometimes its a stranger giving you back your dignity before you even ask.

And then everyone goes home quietly, like that's just what people do.",20,1767357386.0,story,4,0.88,False
1q1xj2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSDD/comments/1q1xj2a/selfstates_alters_and_communication/,"SELF-STATES, ALTERS AND COMMUNICATION?","Hello,

I’m not sure if this will reach the right people or if I will get the answers I need. I will be 23-years-old (f) in two days and it has been a pretty rough year to say the least. I took a trip to the psych ward and started therapy in 2025 and has since been diagnosed with BPD, MDD w/ mixed features, PTSD (we know CPTSD isn’t formal in the U.S.), Primary Insomnia, etc.

We are currently figuring out an OSDD diagnosis. Some of my reasoning for this are accidentally hearing brief internal conversations in moments of stress or sleep-wake states. I’ve always dealt with auditory hallucinations/sensory distortions, but these brief conversations were internal and more like thoughts? (but I’ve heard them? inside?? my??? head????). After telling my therapist who is trauma-informed, she has encouraged me to journal and work on internal communication, but will not diagnose/label me which is understandable.

Here are some ‘fun’ conversations I’ve accidentally tuned into:

“Can she hear us?-“ While in the middle of a mental breakdown, like rude?? I guess?? I CAN hear you (feminine voice)

“Tea.” - Was drawing in bed and got this random suggestion? I made coffee instead of tea lol- (masculine voice)

2 British voices having a pleasant conversation - NO CONTEXT OR UNDERSTANDING (I think 1 male, 1 female)

“You’re fucking disgusting-“ “I already told you that-“ - Also ZERO context and had me very amused and I honestly wish I knew the context (both male I think)

“HELP ME-“ - Also hilarious because it wasn’t in a distressing way, it was more like annoyance and l guess bro was begging to get out or something lol (OLD ASS MAN lol)

I know these are brief and I’m not sure how to proceed with improving with better internal communication since my visualization is poor and I’ve tried writing ad journaling and I don’t see a difference and automatic writing is a hit or miss. Most of the voices are obviously gendered and we have received names (roughly 7), but there is no switching (I am aware of blending, but it mostly feels like someone steps into me? Like we merged? I believe I am the only ANP with many EPs).

Our communication has strictly been somatic, with one instance of me getting a mental screenshot (I created an inner world as per recommended since we didn’t have one and after using Pinterest and using internal guided meditation we kind of created a detailed space).

I did at one point remember something traumatic that made them go quiet for almost two weeks, but progress is slowly coming back. I apologize if this may have been a lot and if it may have been unhelpful. I am open to answering any questions. Any solutions for better communication or any understanding as to my experiences?

1q1xir3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1q1xir3/how_do_i_believe_promises_after_being_blindsided/,How do I believe promises after being blindsided?,"I (31F) found out my husband of 1 year (27M) has been cheating on me for the past three months 2 days before Christmas. It’s been the WORST couple weeks of my life.

A little backstory.. I have never touched my husband’s phone in my life — since the day we started dating 5 years ago. I’ve never wanted to, never had a need, 100% trust — nor has he touched mine. However, when he fell asleep early last weekend and his phone was blowing up with texts from his boss at 9:30pm, I thought to grab it to see if there was some type of emergency. Now, I don’t even know my husband’s phone passcode… but mine if our wedding date so I tried that on his and it worked. I opened the texts from his “boss” and proceeded to see homemade videos of my husband having sex with another woman… alongside a slew of texts that said things like “I want you so bad daddy” and “mmm baby”. So, not only did I find out my husband was sleeping with someone… I also had to see it. Just a bit traumatizing.

I immediately woke him up and confronted him. He snatched the phone and deleted the text thread and the number … so now I only have his word. 

At first he tried to deny it, but he realized pretty quickly he was caught. These are the details he told me: he felt like him and I had become roommates and that the love and joy in our marriage was gone. A woman hit on him at the train station on his commute to work and he gave her his number (along with a fake name). She did not know he was married, as he doesn’t wear his ring for work. He met her at a coffee shop. They met 3 additional times between mid-October and early November at a hotel and had sex each time. While I thought he was at work — he was sleeping with someone in a cheap hotel.

She’d been reaching out periodically since to continue meeting up, to which he’s said he declined. However, he’d been keeping up with the texts and comms (like sharing videos of their time together) to save face… so that she did not try to like, connect his phone number to his socials, find me, reach out, whatever. IDK. F***ing stupid in my opinion, regardless. Just disgusting. As mentioned, I discovered all of this on December 23.

Since all of this happened, I’ve been struggling mentally, physically, and emotionally. At the end of the day, I love him. I believe he is my person. I’d like to make it work… In some bizarre way, we have been more vulnerable with each other and open since. It has cracked open a layer in the relationship. I’ve seen my husband break down crying, which I never had before. I required that we enter couples counseling, to which he agreed. I required he see his own therapist, to which he agreed. We’ve started going to church together for the first time ever. A lot of blessings seem to be coming from this tragedy, which I can’t even believe I’m open to admitting.

However, I’m still terrified. The trust is gone. So much of what I thought about our relationship and marriage seems to have been lies… He was deceiving me. If he hadn’t been caught, what would have happened? Would this continue? Was this going on even longer than he’s told
me? Will this happen again? There are so many unknowns that are completely out of my control and I’m spiraling a bit.

So, if you’ve gotten this far, my question is:  How sincere is it when your husband is finally telling you now that he’s sorry, he loves you, he wants to be with you, wants a family with you, wants everything… that this will never happen again. That this was the biggest mistake of his life… 

If you’ve ever been the cheater, I’d love to hear you weigh in. IS it possible he sincerely
regrets it? Or is it a symptom of getting caught? How do I cope and move past what I now know… what I’ve seen?!?! Ugh. 

I’m so lost and I suppose just looking for some reassurance. As mentioned, in certain ways, our relationship has been better and closer than ever before over these past 2 horrible weeks. In other ways, my fear and anxiety are so high I don’t know what the right thing to do is. Thanks in advance for your input.

TLDR: My husband cheated and got caught. He says he regrets it and has been showing up for me since… but can I believe it?",1,1767357359.0,CheatedOn,5,1.0,False

My morning coffee is a little bitter.

I check my smartphone, but there's no answer.

My heart races for no apparent reason.

There are days like those, don't you think?

I think I'm doing well, thinking things through, and everything should be fine.

But I feel like there's something watching that empty space.

This world is no coincidence.

Unnoticed, someone has been watching me all this time.

Even before I was born.

It's not above, it's not outside, it's not here, it's everywhere.

If I had to give it a name, it would be hazama.

Between me and the world.

When I overlap hazama and my subjectivity,

The world feels a little warmer.

Even if it's not right, it's fine.

My heart fills.

Love doesn't come from gaining something. Just remembering that I'm being watched.

Breathing in this moment.

Being alive is love.

In happy times, even in the dark nights.

There's someone watching me. I'm here

Every time I think I'm alone,

I stop at an intersection

This reality is reflected one by one from the hazama

I see it all,

My perspective, my feelings

Determined the color of the world

When I overlap the hazama and my subjectivity

The world feels a little kinder

Before I blame someone,

My heart unravels

It's okay if we don't understand each other

At that moment, we try to connect

My heart is already

filled with love

The world is created

From the beings who are watching

It's not a matter of believing it

Just living in layers

Not controlling it, not entrusting it

Subjectivity and subjectivity gently overlap

Living with the hazama

In today, it's not special

Crying, laughing, and wavering

But even so, love is here

What I'm watching isn't far away

This is the place I return to

Interacting with the hazama

I live in this world

Not as fandom! Not as nostalgia! But as a quiet recognition of a certain way of moving through the world.

I don’t live the life of a chef, and I don’t rack up passport stamps the way he once did (also they don't really give stamps no more). But what he stood for: the honesty, the curiosity, the refusal to look away from complexity. His voice had a way of cutting through the noise and bland life naming things we feel but rarely articulate.

So this is a small reach outward, to people in Berlin who found something similar in his work. an influence, a compass, maybe just a sense of permission to be thoughtful and hungry at the same time. If this sounds familiar, maybe we sit down for a meal or a coffee. No agenda. Just conversation, and seeing what else we might have in common.

I opened the texts from his “boss” and proceeded to see homemade videos of my husband having sex with another woman… alongside a slew of texts that said things like “I want you so bad daddy” and “mmm baby”. So, not only did I find out my husband was sleeping with someone… I also had to see it. Just a bit traumatizing.

I immediately woke him up and confronted him. He snatched the phone and deleted the text thread and the number … so now I only have his word. 

At first he tried to deny it, but he realized pretty quickly he was caught. These are the details he told me: he felt like him and I had become roommates and that the love and joy in our marriage was gone. A woman hit on him at the train station on his commute to work and he gave her his number (along with a fake name). She did not know he was married, as he doesn’t wear his ring for work. He met her at a coffee shop. They met 3 additional times between mid-October and early November at a hotel and had sex each time. While I thought he was at work — he was sleeping with someone in a cheap hotel.

She’d been reaching out periodically since to continue meeting up, to which he’s said he declined. However, he’d been keeping up with the texts and comms (like sharing videos of their time together) to save face… so that she did not try to like, connect his phone number to his socials, find me, reach out, whatever. IDK. F***ing stupid in my opinion, regardless. Just disgusting. As mentioned, I discovered all of this on December 23.

Since all of this happened, I’ve been struggling mentally, physically, and emotionally. At the end of the day, I love him. I believe he is my person. I’d like to make it work… In some bizarre way, we have been more vulnerable with each other and open since. It has cracked open a layer in the relationship. I’ve seen my husband break down crying, which I never had before. I required that we enter couples counseling, to which he agreed. I required he see his own therapist, to which he agreed. We’ve started going to church together for the first time ever. A lot of blessings seem to be coming from this tragedy, which I can’t even believe I’m open to admitting.

However, I’m still terrified. The trust is gone. So much of what I thought about our relationship and marriage seems to have been lies… He was deceiving me. If he hadn’t been caught, what would have happened? Would this continue? Was this going on even longer than he’s told
me? Will this happen again? There are so many unknowns that are completely out of my control and I’m spiraling a bit.

So, if you’ve gotten this far, my question is:  How sincere is it when your husband is finally telling you now that he’s sorry, he loves you, he wants to be with you, wants a family with you, wants everything… that this will never happen again. That this was the biggest mistake of his life… 

If you’ve ever been the cheater, I’d love to hear you weigh in. IS it possible he sincerely
regrets it? Or is it a symptom of getting caught? How do I cope and move past what I now know… what I’ve seen?!?! Ugh. 

I’m so lost and I suppose just looking for some reassurance. As mentioned, in certain ways, our relationship has been better and closer than ever before over these past 2 horrible weeks. In other ways, my fear and anxiety are so high I don’t know what the right thing to do is. Thanks in advance for your input.

TLDR: My husband cheated and got caught. He says he regrets it and has been showing up for me since… but can I believe it?

1q1xeov,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1q1xeov/bad_and_good_new_coffees_2025/,Bad and good new coffees 2025,"I live in Germany. The posts and the comments on this sub aroused my curiosity to try new roasters, among others from the USA but also from Europe. I have to say, many highly praised and partly expensive coffees here were below expectations or mediocre, especially when I compare them to my favourite roasters. So, here are my experiences: 

NEGATIVE IMPRESSIONS, DISAPPOINTINING:

SEY- Ethiopian Koko washed lot #159, Yaye Chericho washed and White Honey Tamiru Tadesse. All 3 were below expectations, little flavour, little character, weak, bland. Nothing I would remember. 

Datura Paris- Ethiopia Alo Chilaka 74158 natural. Nothing special. Also expensive. Tanat from Paris had roasted the same coffee much better, it had so many flavour nuances.

Substance Paris- Ethiopia Wachile Garse natural and Panama Geisha Esmeralda Buenos Aires 8FB. The Ethiopian is nothing special, even 4 weeks after roast. The roast is not bad, I think the beans are mediocre. 
The Panama Esmeralda Geisha was quite good only at day 21 after roasting but not anymore at day 28, it became weak in the taste. But even at day 21 it was not such good as we expected and as I know from other times in the past. 32€ for 50 grams, 3 brews, only one brew was good. 

Nomad Barcelona Spain- Ethiopia Faysel Abdosh natural. Not bad but there was something missing, the aroma and the taste were not clear, I don’t know why. I couldn’t enjoy. 


Coffea Circulor Norway- 2 Ethiopian coffees, the Alo Bembe and the Alto Arbegona. They sent also a small bag as a gift. My wife and I clearly noticed when opening the bags that in all three was a citrus-like essence, i.e. an aroma that does not belong naturally to the coffee. Although Ethiopian coffees can often have a citrus-like aroma, this was obviously not natural.
I didn’t like the roasting either, very very light, so you miss important nuances, you mainly have citrus and unpleasant acidity.  Even 3 or 6 weeks or 3 months later, it still smelted like that unnatural aroma, whereby the own aroma of the beans had unfolded and mixed with that intense citrus-like aroma. Do they spray the bags with such an aroma?
Another negative: roast date was not written on the bags!!
I sent a polite email and asked for an explanation for this unnatural aroma and for the roast date, no response since early August 2025... 

Coffee Collective Denmark- Coffees from Kenya, Ethiopia..something was missing, no vibration and intensity enough. 

Stiller’s coffee Denmark- Disappointed. 


POSITIVE IMPRESSIONS, GREAT DISCOVERIES

Onyx- 2 coffees from Kenya, Gichangi and Kibingo. Nice roasts, light but on the right point, nice coffees, I liked them. 
Problem: I ordered from Sigma in England, roasts should be till 6 weeks old, the one was 8 weeks old. They did not answer my complaint. Not customer-friendly, not fair.  

Prodigal- Finca La Pradera washed Pink Bourbon from Colombia and Granja El Tempixque from Guatemala. Great coffees, great roasts! This is real quality!! 

DAK- Milky Way from Colombia. A very good coffee with a good roast. We enjoyed. I think this coffee is so good from itself that you don’t need to be a great roaster for having success. But anyway it is a good coffee, not for every day and moment. Contrary to an order from DAK 2 years ago, where I was disappointed because the coffees did not yield any special flavour, this one was good enough. 

Prolog Denmark- I bought 5-6 different coffees. Roasted in the light-medium range, some of them were really very good. 

Create coffee roasters, Athens, Greece- medium roast which I generally do not like. But I bought some great coffee beans from them. Maybe my best coffee of the year was their Papayo from Colombia: Amazing!! Also the Chiroso from Las Flores is great. Their coffees need 91-93 C water temperature because of the medium roast, not more. 
The owner was world champion 2014 in World Brewers Cup, Stefanos Domatiotis, great guy, I met him at the coffee festival in Amsterdam April 2025. 


Conclusion: So much money spent for so many praised and expensive  coffee roasters that were nothing special for me. For my palate of course and my wife’s. They had nothing special, nothing to remember about. I know taste is subjective but…

But thanks god I could enjoy some great or amazing coffees also. 

I use mainly Hario V60 for pouring, but also Kalita Wave, sometimes Mocamaster. For grinding I use Femobook A4Z, ZP6 special, Comadante (rarely) and Timemore 078. 

My favourite roasters are:
Tanat from France
Blommers Coffee from Netherlands
Create coffee roasters from Greece
Prodigal from USA.

I wish you happy new year and great coffees in 2026!

Last Thursday afternoon, my husband and I decided to go for a walk around town. We wanted a change of scenery, to breathe some fresh air, and, why not, have a coffee at a shopping mall. Those little spontaneous plans that come up without much planning, but end up being the most beautiful.

The weather was simply perfect. It didn't rain in the early morning, which is already a good start. The sky was adorned with clouds that looked like fluffy white pieces combined with sky blue, the temperature was quite cool, something unusual on our beloved island, where heat is usually the protagonist, and the wind created an atmosphere of tranquility that felt like a gift.

# Weather & Weekend Outlook:

New Year's Day is behind us and we might catch some sunshine today, but don't get too comfortable. Temps are sliding into the single digits by evening with wind chills dipping below zero overnight. Saturday and Sunday stay brisk with highs stuck in the mid teens and lows bouncing around zero. A few lake effect flurries could drift in, but we should stay mostly dry. Early next week brings a chance for more widespread snow before a warmup pushes highs back toward the 30s by midweek.



# SOME of what's in this week's news:

* New ""American Abenaki"" curriculum draws sharp rebuke from Quebec based First Nations who call it a ""rewriting of history,"" with Rep. Headrick prepping legislation that would require their endorsement before it's used in schools
* City Councilor Becca Brown McKnight joined WVMT's Morning Drive this week and the conversation got real. Burlington is staring down a $12 million budget gap, and the proposed public safety tax only covers about a third of it.
* Vermont lands $195 million in federal rural health care funding, nearly double what the state expected, making it one of the highest per capita awards nationally
* South Burlington hires Joe Clark as permanent superintendent with a four year, $200K contract after he met with nearly 300 community members through his ""3Q meetings""
* The 30% federal solar tax credit officially expired this week, and local installers say they were fully booked by August as homeowners raced to beat the deadline
* State return to office mandate sees no mass exodus despite union warnings, with resignations actually down 10% compared to last year
* Burlington mental health provider Revolution Youth settles Medicaid fraud claims for $200K after admitting to backdated records and fabricated billing

Anyone else feel like crypto is oddly… calm?

No crazy hype.  
No nonstop moon tweets.  
No “this will replace everything by next year” energy.

But after reading today’s crypto news, I don’t think that’s a bad sign.

It feels like crypto is growing up.

A few things I noticed 

**Regulation isn’t the villain anymore.**  
Yeah, rules are annoying. Always have been.  
But what’s happening now feels different. Stablecoins are being forced to actually prove they’re stable. Shady stuff is getting filtered out. The serious players are still standing.

**Institutions didn’t rage quit. They just went quiet.**  
Banks and funds aren’t yelling on Twitter.  
They’re building in the background tokenized funds, custody, onchain settlement, even using Bitcoin as collateral instead of trying to buy coffee with it.

That kind of adoption is boring… until it isn’t.

**DeFi isn’t dead. It’s just less loud.**  
The wild yield farms are fading, but what’s replacing them feels more real:  
KYC pools. Real world assets. Stuff that can actually plug into the financial system without blowing up.

Not exciting screenshots. Just foundations.

**The tech conversation changed.**  
It’s not “which chain is fastest” anymore.  
It’s “does this work reliably, cheaply, and at scale?”

Layer 2s. Interoperability. Boring problems that actually matter.

**Security is finally taken seriously.**  
Audits, monitoring, certifications used to be “nice to have.”
