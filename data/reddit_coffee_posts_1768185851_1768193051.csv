My oldest roast was dates December 2023. 
My favorite roaster has been Agro 
My favorite roast has been light 
My favorite continent for coffee is Africa, shout out Ethiopian and Kenya. 

And to quote ChatGPT 

"" If someone handed you: a dark French roast, Brewed at 1:15, In a paper cup, there’s a non-zero chance you’d take one sip and politely abandon it."" 

I have more bags at the office not included in this, but over all ive been happy. 

I think Agro is the best bang for buck coffee that ive found. I thought Monogram was one of the less bang for buck coffees, Tebilcock, Rock Mountain and The Columbian have been the most memorable and, Black Pearl has been the most ""out there"".

Heres a list of all the roasters pictured:

Agro Roasters – Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

Monogram Coffee – Calgary, Alberta, Canada

- sometimes still uses baby talk. I don’t mind it too much but I cringe in certain situations

- does not have a license in a driving city

- never worked a job outside her parents catering business 

- lives at home, doesn’t pay rent or bills 

- doesn’t initiate plans ever. But does check up on me by msging

I’ve grown to accept this is the life she wants and she won’t grow independence unless she needs it. What I struggle with is that she never initiates plans, ever. I always initiate. She will
Check on me and messages that she misses me - which is cue she wants me to plan. 

And she will always need to be driven around when we create plans. To her credit, she never gets mad if I can’t pick her up but her parents are her alternate form of transportation. And she repays me by getting coffee or dinner.

Recently she bothered me because I always invite her to my social outings, yet she doesn’t want me to meet the group of people she plays video games with. They are online friends. She says it’s because I have more friends irl so I can pick and choose who she meets - but she’s met majority of them, besides a few. 

So it feels like to me - I’m always initiating, driving her around and she doesn’t let me into her life at all. So im currently “distancing” myself - as in, I’m letting her do the initiation and won’t invite her as much to social gatherings. 

But I feel like I’m AIO because she is very kind, always listens to be, celebrates my wins, and repays me back in favours when I drive her around for when we hangout. So in my mind I feel like I should accept her just as she is and continue how I am…

Long time lurker, first time poster. This community has given me a lot of valuable insight and information as I’ve gone through my diagnosis. 
I had surgery 4 weeks ago to remove about 20cm sigmoid colon due to Stage 1 cancer. Very blessed I don’t require further treatment. 

I’ve scoured other posts on this and I know everyone is different, but I’m feeling frustrated at my seemingly erratic digestive system. 
I was given no dietary advice in the hospital, but aimed to follow low fibre. I’ve triggered a couple of flares with a vegan protein powder (didn’t realise it contained fava beans!) and a glass of coke. The last week or so I’ve slowly been able to tolerate some more vegetables and soft fruit. Doing ok with cheese, yoghurt, white carbs, and one coffee a day. 

Yesterday at a friend’s house for lunch and something triggered horrific cramps, gas, nausea and diarrhea. I’m thinking it was the tiny amount of chimichurri I tried which contained raw garlic and jalapeños. I had maybe 1/2 tsp. 

My father in law had a bowel resection 1 week prior to me and he is tolerating all foods and drinks no problem. It’s hard trying not to compare our healing - I’m a healthy 39 year of female, he’s a 74 year old male. 

Just a bit of a vent but also keen to hear what others experiences were like.

Stuck on the fence","I own a 2016 gt3rs, it's been 2 years of joy but in respect of limited earth time, i'd like to swap it out and experience something else plus my CPO warranty runs out in 10 months. A 992.1 turbo s is the front runner currently, i'm aware that it will be more sterile with less soul, however I also own an 800hp mk4 supra, 700 hp terminator and a fox body (all 3 are permanent cars for me) so the raw/analog soul experience can be had in other ways.

The 992 gt3 is appealing due to the manual option especially in the touring trim without the wing, relative rarity and sound. The turbo s is drawing me in with the easy power, comfort and ability to go on road trips. I have 2 4runners that I currently daily but would love to swap the next porsche in for daily activities. We are expecting our first kid in june and stuffing a car seat in the back for cars and coffee seems like a good time? My wife is short so i'm hoping it leaves some space back there lol.

I know the turbo S gets bashed by GT fan boys but it seems like a really great all around super car that avoids the extreme attention you get with other exotics.

Option 3 is extending my warranty for a 4th year if possible and keeping the 3rs, I do love that car.

I don't track my cars, they're just used for light highway racing and spirited back road driving.

1qal9sm,https://i.redd.it/4mhjzr0hiucg1.jpeg,Looking for feedback on a budgeting app with biweekly pay periods,"Hi everyone,

I’ve posted here before about a budgeting app I’m building. It allows logging transactions almost automatically via iOS shortcuts to keep things private (no bank integrations).

I’ve updated the app since posting last time, and the biggest change is the addition of biweekly budgeting periods, which are surprisingly under-supported in most budgeting apps despite being very common. This makes the app good for users who get paid biweekly and value privacy, as I do not collect any data whatsoever. 

There is an optional Premium version that includes:

• Visual spending insights with donut charts and custom views (needs/wants/savings, fixed vs. variable, or fully custom)
• Unlimited savings goals with clear progress tracking
• CSV export

I’m currently working on new features and would love to hear feedback for the next update!

Premium pricing:

• Monthly: $4.99 USD ($2.99 if subscribed within 3 days)
• Yearly: $44.99 USD ($29.99 if subscribed within 3 days)
• Lifetime: $79.99 USD

Early users can lock in a lower monthly price forever by subscribing within 3 days of downloading (as long as the subscription stays active).

# Misguided ""Angel"", Minea:

Name: Minea Samppa

Age: 27

Gender: Female

Race: 100% whole milk /j.

# Personality, and stuff:

Works as a moderator, well regarded by colleagues and for good reason. Known for quick work and has actually banned rogue builders before. Though less well regarded now, due to her inability to catch Hammy, a 15-year-old boy.

She doesn't really have many connections aside from her colleagues, though always tags along with Toinen Kohtuullisuus, and strangely distant from her family.

In her free time, she goes around helping people whenever she feels like it, which is almost never since her work leaves her exhausted. Her main hobby is well, work, though she sometimes likes to play with innocuous equipment during night shifts, very much a fidgeter, absolutely loves burning banned models. She also really likes to collect anything she finds on the street during patrol or just walking in general. 

She secretly plays Ape Escape during work, especially during slow days. Really likes to play with balls. (And I'm talking about balls, as in Basketball, or Football. Not THAT kind of 'balls')

Her weaknesses are, a minor obsession with caffeinated products, mainly drinking way too much coffee or drinking more than one energy drink. And although she denies it, she's pretty impressionable, which is why she suffers from the corruption going on in the background of Roblox. Way too loyal to her work and lacks autonomy when taking action.

Her family mainly consists of her mom and dad, and a few uncles and aunts. She's an only child. She never talks about her family, not even sparing names, typically shutting down people when they get too nosy about her bloodline, except with her aunt and uncle strangely enough.

No matter how much she likes to avoid it, Toinen is basically her best and ""only"" friend. Her colleagues are just people she gets along with but not really intimate at all. Though she does have positive memories related all her colleagues.

Her enemies consist of Hammy, because of course she will, with how he consistently badmouths Roblox moderation, evades taxes like cancer, has literally killed people, ransacks towns when he's too broke. Against the Tundra Squidlings because she genuinely considers them evil but doesn't really do anything because she rarely persecutes autonomously outside of missions and work.

On the surface seems completely normal, just a mild-mannered, stubborn, aggressive woman who has a more insane, crazy side, possibly with autism. But deeply avoids and suppresses one aspect of her consistently haunting her... parents. And it affects her line of work, mainly making her very confrontative sometimes, and deeply obsessed with ""perfection"" hence why she likes to perform at her best, even if it's barely demanding. (Making patrols so boring to her, that she likes to recollect random things on the way and keep them, hence why she developed that hobby) 

It's also the reason why she has a poor sense of autonomy and also why she's impressionable.

She has an apartment literally right next to Roblox HQ.

Minea is somewhat aggressive and ""dominant"", very mild-mannered and not exactly fancy at all, though she's not completely against the more concept. Despite everything she's been through, she always has faith, faith in her sense of morality, very related with her line of work, often to the point of zealotry, making her jump to conclusions, and at worst downright reckless and again, her poor sense of autonomy, very defensive and is prone to getting violent when having her morality criticized.

Minor stubbornness, but not to the level of someone like Hammy.

# Equipment:

Banhammer:  
She's practically in a long-term relationship with the thing, she doesn't use anything besides this banhammer, even if it would really help with a certain guy she really wants to catch.

It's a large, blue hammer with gray bevels and a helix-looking handle. One bonk with this little thing and you're banned, either for 1 day, 3 days, or even forever.

Portable Justice:

She used to use this a lot more before she had a high enough rank to wield a Banhammer.

A tiny cage that grows and enraptures a given target. Once she got the Banhammer she practically never uses it unless she needs to inhibit the opponent.

# Powers:

Can survive explosions, with supernatural resistance to elements and stuff, which is because of her scripting prowess, hence her impressive performance. Can technically travel back in time but takes a lot of time and due to the limitations of scripting, she can only go backwards in time and she's always the same age between travel.

# Skills and Abilities:

UPB (Uber-Protection Barrier): 

An invisible barrier that takes a lot of energy, things around this barrier slows anything around it down to a crawl until it literally cannot move, hence why she uses it sparsely.

'P' Barrier (Physics Barrier):

Uses a script to spawn a brick wall, or if she's feeling a little insulting, a lone brick to block an attack. Like a builder, she can freely manipulate the material and color of the block, change its position, duplicate it, and even destroy it.

Procedural Inhibition:

Procedurally generates a structure or a calculated array of spawning or falling bricks to Minea's will, but takes a lot of time to prepare, so they're usually pre-made. Usually, to trap large and or powerful opponents that can't really be inhibited by normal means. (I.E. The poor portable justice's little jail won't cut it, since they either can't catch them with it, or they can literally break through it).

Uninhibited Generation:

Randomly generates bricks around a set area to throw off opponents and basically puts the battle in the hands of pseudorandom in hopes that it'll mess up her enemy's coordination or block their attacks. An off shoot of Procedural Inhibition, since the difference between the two, is this is uncoordinated and random.

Double Barrier: 

Increases defense to any degree but can only block one blow before resetting to natural defenses. Nothing special.

Transfiguration:

Manipulates Minea's body to her heart's content. Like Hammy.

1qal4f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_hymnsomnia/comments/1qal4f0/random_thoughts_2/,Random thoughts 2,"Ayo what the hell is this 😂😂😂😂😂

I don’t think anyone is here at this point, at least not any unknown people or randoms. The two exes are not here either… at least not from what I can see. On the other account, some random guy did become fixated and start to monitor me, and I think he lives in California based on his comments. So, in all likelihood, he would have become a more serious orbiter if I responded to him - he might think I live near him. But, I have no idea who he is, and I’ve never really dated anyone from here before; just this one guy who I left after 2 months in high school. I still don’t know how I got into this situation in the first place re: the exposure of my accounts, but it started when I came across a screenshot of my old BPD loved ones post. The post was of a series of text messages in which the BPD ex claimed that he “might be assassinated in the coming days” because there was a “plot in motion against him.” Of course, this was a bullshit claim, and was just one of hundreds of desperate attempts to get me to resume contact with him (the tactic is to stage a crisis to force a response from the person). I thought the screenshot was funny and posted it for some reason; he then saw it since he still monitors me online. After that, he navigated to the reddit account that it was posted on (which was the now-defunct one), made a fake burner account called “beat off to my memory,” (how creative!) and “trolled” me with the burner account, which was not so fun. After that, I left some messages to him on the account which told him not to break No Contact, and someone saw them; I couldn’t tell if it was him or not since he had blocked me on the “beat off to my memory” account. So, I spammed a bunch of creative writing from my notes app over a 5-7 day period to see what would happen and found that someone opened/read it all; there were also 2 downvotes (accidental or purposeful - who knows). I wasn’t convinced that the BPD ex would read stuff I wrote since he told me that he “hated reading” and “couldn’t read for more than 5 minutes” - he never once read stuff I wrote or cared about it at all. He wants to know what I’m up to but is not the type to read verbose and symbolic shit; it was hard to picture him doing that or ascertain a motive. I didn’t think he even cared that much at this point. So I was forced to assume that it could be another person. Who knows! If it was indeed him, he kind of fucked me over with that shit, and I’m surprised he read that stuff at all. It makes little sense to me because 99% of the time he just looks at instagram. I can’t ask him if it was him or not due to his aggression; his hatred towards me is now a built-in feature. That is because, when he made hundreds of attempts to reconnect and/or get me back over a 12 month period, I didn’t budge a single time because he had turned out to be a lost cause. As for why he still monitors me, I don’t know and I can’t figure it out; I went No Contact with him long ago after he decided to cross the most serious line and forced me to conclude that he couldn’t be helped (which he can’t… he doesn’t think he needs help even though his reactive outbursts are extreme and severe). I think he wants to know what I’m doing without him and misses the “adventures” that he experienced because of me. At one point, I watched his instagram story using one of those anonymous ghost viewers, and it was a picture of a happy couple by the ocean with the caption “Sometimes, you don’t know what you had until it’s gone.” It made me wonder if he regretted some of his actions towards me deep down. But, if he does, he’ll never admit it. He prefers to lie and claim that he dumped me because I “did stuff” with 3 other people, among other alleged crimes; this is the narrative that he created to vindicate himself, cope with the outcome, avoid the full truth and exact revenge. From what his friends have told me, his condition has deteriorated since I departed, and he dropped out of college, claims to be an alcoholic, and continues to lash out at people for no reason and threaten suicide (with me the suicide threats were manipulative and progressed from an occasional problem to something that occurred at least 4x per week… he would claim that he was about to jump off a bridge when he was just in his room). He also committed a violent act against his brother’s girlfriend - but I don’t know the details. I’m not sure that he will ever be able to live a normal life. But I try to see the good in people until I truly can’t anymore, and that was what caused me to get stuck in that situation. Never again! He did seem stable at first and worsened over time so there is that. All I know is that he could have been the person who was on the first account for a week or so. He’s not here now so I have no idea. I’ve been banned from a lot of sub reddits over time… I was banned from a true crime sub for criticizing a woman who let her bf molest her own daughter (because women can do no wrong ig), banned from the Europe sub for citing poll results the moderators didn’t like, banned from random political or news subs, and banned from a relationship advice sub for saying that someone involved in the situation was under 18. But, I had changed the ages of all of the people involved to preserve anonymity, and none of them were under 18. In one post I think I said someone was 24 when they’re actually going on 27. What are they gonna do about it? What if the person found the post and saw that it was about them? That would be so cursed. I don’t “like” this website because of the excessive moderation and the perverts who are on here. Even now I could have an unknown lurker from Pakistan or some shit. But I have like 20 days left until the gavel falls and I find out whether I can just log off and disappear myself (I get very sick of the internet at times and must draw a line in the sand at some point to resolve all unresolved situations!).

I’m at home today because my legs are shot. That’s what happens when you log at least 40,000 steps in just a few days. It’s a good thing, though, because it’s good for my health. There are endless places to explore out there in the world and I had a great day yesterday. The area North of San Francisco is very beautiful, so I like to go up there; the beaches and coastal mountains are awesome and full of paths and trails with scenic views. The beaches feature dramatic cliffs and coastal bluffs and the mountains feature ravines, waterfalls, creeks, rock formations, unlogged forests (different kinds), and views of the ocean. I was on the mountain for several hours and found it magical - I could have spent a week there. The canyons in the mountain are very moist and lush while the uplands are covered in coastal scrub and provide the best views of the ocean and surrounding cities. The area North of the mountain has some of the best coastal scenery and cleanest beaches I’ve ever seen. The only downside is how popular this area has gotten; there are some annoying people who blast their music on speakers or clog up the trail and it’s hard to park on a weekend. The subcontinental tourists are the worst because once they discover an area, neighborhood, or industry, they take over. I’ve seen massive throngs of them here, 100 miles away from here, the Southwest, and even in the White Mountains. It’s no different from how they tend to take over the corporate environment - or specific economic niches e.g. convenience stores - by firing or excluding non-subcontinentals and exclusively hiring other subcontinentals. In most cases, they stick to their own, and they will sometimes harm a non-subcontinental to help a fellow subcontinental if needed (ethnic nepotism). As tourists, they can be quite a disturbance, since they tend to flood specific areas en masse; they can also be quite unfriendly and closed off towards non-subcontinentals. Most of the ones here self-segregate, prefer to associate with other subcontinentals, only want to live around other subcontinentals (this is how they take over entire neighborhoods and push other ethnicities out), and avoid casual interaction with non-subcontinentals - it is quite rare for them to so much as smile at a white person in a suburban setting. I don’t hate them, and I don’t view them as a monolith, but their nepotism and behavior as tourists irritates me at times; I’ve also been hit on by older subcontinental men before and found it quite uncomfortable. A lot of them have a rather conspicuous superiority complex and I have also noted that aspect. Entire neighborhoods here feel like Gujarat. But you would need to have lived around large numbers of them to understand what I mean. The Chinese tourists can be a bit of a problem too - in fact one of them filmed me under less-than-ideal circumstances in Arches National Park - so it’s not just one group. Still, a lot of these places would be paradise on Earth if the tourists were reduced. Remove the tourists and this mountain would be a paradise. Others seem to agree since all the rich white people live in this area - some on the sides of the mountain. One town near the mountain, called Mill Valley, is full of white multimillionaires who wanted to live in a beautiful environment. A lot of rich white people also move to this area to escape “diversity” - which is an interesting phenomenon that I’ve observed a lot here (most of our former white neighbors, who claimed to be liberal and pro mass immigration despite the negative impact that mass immigration has on cost of living and wage growth, moved away the moment the subcontinentals started taking over the neighborhood). Let’s be honest - no matter how liberal they claim to be, most white liberals choose to live in the whitest neighborhoods possible. And, as someone who does not identify as liberal or conservative, I feel free to point it out. But I do not think this is because of “hatred:” it’s because in-group preference is inherent to our psychology and is normal and natural. It’s why most people have more friends of their own race etc. In-group preference is not the same as racism; in fact all racial groups exhibit it. It is not exclusive to white people. In fact, I believe that certain more extreme manifestations of in-group preference (e.g. ethnic nepotism and exclusion of other groups) are now least noticeable in white people; I have never seen white people exhibit these behaviors to the same extent as the subcontinentals, for example. While contra-narrative, there is a lot of evidence that white people are lowest in ethnocentrism and ethnic nepotism in the modern context, which can be readily observed when the openness (for example, openness to immigration - most non-Western countries have a much more “xenophobic” immigration policy… like China for example) and individualism of Europeans is contrasted with the more clannish, tribal, and collectivist culture/behavior seen in some other groups. Differences in a single serotonin transporter gene (in terms of allele frequencies) were found to predict individualism-collectivism across 30+ nations; thus, some populations may be more prone to individualism/collectivism than others due to culture-gene coevolution. “Rugged individualism” is a Western European ethos not found in other parts of the world; collectivism predominates in places like East Asia. In the United States, of all ethnic groups surveyed (which was all of them), white people were the group least likely to agree with the statement “My ethnicity is an important part of my identity.” This translates to lower ethnocentrism. I’ve found a lot of studies/data that indicated that in-group preference, ethnic nepotism, and ethnocentrism are not exclusive to white people at all - and often appear to be lower in white people than in other groups. All human groups exhibit these attributes, yes, but white people are the only ones allowing millions of foreign refugees to settle in their countries and donating trillions to help poor people on the other side of the globe; most antiracist activists are also white. The lower ethnocentrism of modern white people seems to have evolved from the more individualist Western European mindset (which is perceived as incompatible with racial collectivism). Alas, the notion that white people are the most racist people on Earth and/or the sole source of racism is not true, and is but a ridiculous and propagandistic mischaracterization of reality that needs to be countered. A lot of the most racist people I’ve met were not white. And the difference between in-group preference and racism needs to be considered by those who promote Critical Race Theory. If in-group preference is racism/akin to hatred, instead of a natural phenomenon that can be observed in all groups, then the subcontinentals here are far more racist than the white people. What causes problems is their exclusion of other groups - it forces us out of various neighborhoods, job sectors, etc. and results in a sort of alienation. But it is what it is. Wow, what a tangent! I’m not supposed to comment on that stuff! But it’s just a reflection on the innate characteristics of our species and how those characteristics manifest in a modern urban environment. I’m sure a lot of other people have questioned the “white people are the most racist people on Earth” narrative and noticed that other groups also segregate themselves based on race in neighborhoods etc. Anyways, after I left the mountain yesterday, I wanted to visit this place called the Sutro baths and watch the sunset there. It’s a beach with the ruins of a massive bathhouse on it. The traffic on and around the Golden Gate Bride was bad, which it often is, so I was worried I wouldn’t make it down there in time; I could see the sun’s descent and believed I wouldn’t make it. But, when I went down there, the sunset had just started. At first, it was just blue and yellow, so I didn’t think it would be that colorful. But, after 15 minutes, it was blue, yellow, orange, pink and purple, and was one of the best sunsets I’ve ever seen or photographed. A lot of photographers came down to capture it and all of us just sat there and watched it for a while. But there’s other stuff to do there: You can climb the ruins, hike up the coastal cliffs, and walk through a tunnel in the cliffs sort of like the one in Oregon (inside the tunnel you can hear the waves crashing on the rocks). I believe it was a lucky “accident” that I witnessed such a nice sunset the one moment I decided to walk down there. This one beat almost all the others I’ve seen since 2020. It was the best possible end to the trip. In 2020 and 2021, I used to visit this area a lot, because I had a friend who lived up there; this was when I had a larger “social circle” (which I later moved on from because a lot of these people turned out to be bad influences and almost all the dudes would make moves on me - some of whom were not nice about it). I had fun with those friends at the time because we never just sat at home; we did stuff all the time. And I liked to be a bit far from home some weekends. 

The best way to prevent depression is to do stuff and enjoy the world around you! If you sit at home all the time, do nothing, get zero exercise, hide from your problems, and refuse to address your problems, of course you’ll be depressed. We’re not made to live like that; we’re made to get some fresh air and enjoy new experiences. The more fun or productive stuff you do, the less room there is for negative or intrusive thoughts to proliferate, so you will ruminate less and live in the moment more. That’s why, when people claim that all depression is caused by low serotonin, they’re full of shit; depression can also happen when your basic needs are not being met or when you’re bored or isolated. In fact, there is no substantial evidence that low serotonin is the cause of depression in most cases (it can be because of a different neurotransmitter like dopamine - or none at all), and antidepressants that block serotonin reuptake aren’t even better than placebo - they just make you feel numb and disconnect you from your emotions. Antidepressants can also cause a form of permanent and untreatable chemically induced asexuality known as Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction - the pills are poison and cause a form of dependence. In the US, doctors are far too fast to jump to medication, so almost 1 in 8 US adults are on these pills. Meanwhile, a lot of people’s depression would improve if they took better care of themselves, got more exercise, went outside more, replaced bad relationships with better relationships, faced their problems head-on, and worked to create change in their lives instead of sitting on their asses. When I try to take better care of myself, I definitely feel a lot better. And when I get out and do things, my negative thoughts just disappear. It’s when I have nothing to do that the unwanted repetitive thoughts or negative thoughts become a problem. It’s important to enjoy the beauty of the world, appreciate the simple things and let go of bad relationships that hold you down. It is possible to recover from depression by getting rid of the specific environmental conditions that made you depressed in the first place and replacing them with better environmental conditions - conditions that are more fulfilling and more compatible with who you are as a person, what you need, what makes you feel positive, etc. I saw a lot of improvement in my own anxiety from exercising, getting active, removing manipulative and unstable people from my life, and embracing stoicism and outcome independence, which is when you are able to accept either potential outcome. Most importantly, I don’t care what other people think of me anymore, and I’m not willing to pretend to be a different person just to conform; it’s not worth it and will not help you connect with others - you may feel “less alone” but the people around you don’t actually appreciate you or value you in an authentic way if you’re pretending to be someone you’re not just to fit in or whatever. You have to embrace your actual self to be happy in the long-term - and find people who truly accept, understand and appreciate your actual self and what you have to offer. A lot of people have judged me and that’s fine with me. I don’t need their validation or approval to accept myself; it’s on me to do that.

One thing about California is that it is simultaneously one of the most interesting pieces of land on the planet and one of the most poorly governed pieces of land on the planet. California has extremely diverse landscapes, geology, and geography, is a biodiversity hotspot, and boasts 10-11 mountain ranges, stratovolcanos, the tallest mountain in the lower 48, the lowest elevation point in North America, the tallest trees in the world, the largest trees in the world, the oldest trees in the world, the hottest air temperatures recorded on Earth, miles of undeveloped coastline, a single region with a higher GDP than most states, and diverse ecosystems and environments (deserts, rainforests, scrubland, mountains, valleys, beaches, etc.). There is more variety in this state than almost anywhere else in the country. And, like most Western states, it has an open, “expansive” feeling that most Eastern states lack; I believe I feel this East-West distinction because Western states have more diverse geography, more national parks, more undeveloped wilderness, and more spaced out population centers. Eastern states can feel a bit “cramped” and stifling in comparison due to the relative lack of diverse environments and grandiose scenery. Eastern states are also more monotonous (everything looks about the same for miles and miles). But, because coastal California has such a pleasant climate and offers a lot of economic opportunities, the population is large and is often growing; the state government is also horrible (as are the local governments). As a direct result of this poor governance (plus the high desirability of the location), problems include high cost of living, high income tax, high property tax, crime, homelessness, etc. We have had our cars broken into multiple times and it’s just a fact of life here. It’s more dangerous to walk alone in most cities. You need to find a good job to achieve a decent standard of living. Sanctuary cities fill the area with unknown people. Criminals are released onto the streets. A lot of things are banned (except weed). Regulations are too strict and hurt businesses (strangulation by over-regulation). To make matters worse, PG&E, naive environmental groups, and local governments have caused catastrophic wildfires with their negligence, because they refuse to do what is needed to prevent these fires (prescribed burns, forest thinning, brush removal). This subpar forest management caused one of my favorite forests to burn down in 2020. Some level of forest management could have prevented it. When Los Angeles was on fire, the mayor wasn’t even in the country, she was in Africa! And now she wants to replace the burned neighborhoods with “affordable housing complexes.” But she has 2 brain cells at most. Speaking of shit politicians, the controversial California governor Gavin Newsom lives in the nice area North of San Francisco that I mentioned earlier - with other people like himself, so he doesn’t have to experience ANY of the negative effects of his own policies in his day to day life - lol. It’s a shame what they have done to the state. It’s still a lot more beautiful than other places I’ve been. And it also made me privileged since my parents found success here. I lived in Utah briefly, and it was beautiful too - impressive geography, but it’s dominated by Mormon culture which can be quite confusing for non-Mormons. Mormons have weird “rules” like not being allowed to consume hot beverages like coffee or tea, getting married at 18 and sex segregating everything. It was interesting to observe their alternative way of life but there is no doubt that the Book of Mormon is just a delusional man’s fairytale. 

I’ve seen my brother’s friends a lot lately because they practically live here half the time. I don’t mind them at all but all of them are a bit “off” in their own way. The first one is very chill and works in pest control but gets offended sometimes. The second one has some kind of eating problem and won’t eat anything except croutons and hot dogs, which caused him to not develop properly; he also dates the worst people due to desperation. The third one is a nice guy but has a super annoying voice (I can’t stand it when he talks near my ear) and is not very smart; he is loved and appreciated but the people around him are all in agreement that he’s kind of dull… He has a typical boomer conservative mentality (Israel is awesome, Trump has no flaws, the Chinese secretly control the US government, shit like that). The fourth one has been around for over a decade but has some serious problems: a speech impediment, porn addiction, agoraphobia, and some other stuff. Because of his agoraphobia, he can’t leave the neighborhood, and he is often awake all night. He doesn’t work, go to college, or do anything due to the agoraphobia, and his situation seems severe. But, he sometimes DMs me on instagram, and once it was a massive WTF moment. At some point, he started asking me sexual questions, and asked me if I would hook up with him several times. He has no social skills so it didn’t shock me that much. But it was still super weird. At the time, I showed his texts to the BPD ex, and I thought the BPD ex understood that the texts were unwanted. But, months later, the BPD ex had a paranoid episode and accused me of hooking up with him when I was just taking a walk around the neighborhood to clear my head. He made these accusations often despite his access to my phone - plus the fact that he knew I was strongly opposed to casual sex, thots, sexual degeneracy, party culture and so on. But this was on another level of horrible.

I have a lot more “random thoughts” in my head (none of which are negative or problematic right now - yay) but I can’t type more right now even though I type fast. I gotta rest and recover until my legs get un sore. And debate what I can cook for dinner tomorrow. I went to a lot of restaurants this week which would be bad for most people but is good for me. Of the progress I do see with regard to my weight gain goal, all of it is good, since I think the fat has only gone to the right places and improved what I see; in fact it will accentuate my non rectangular and non pudgy body shape (I hate to be mean, but I’m glad I don’t have a pudgy body shape, fat midsection or zero waist to hip ratio, since these do not look good in my opinion… with some women their waist and hip measurements are the same or near the same or their waist is fatter and it just looks a lot worse from an aesthetics perspective, especially if they also suffer from pudgyness… rip). Tonight I just ate steak but I have learned how to make a lot of things and used to make food for friends back when I did hold “social gatherings” at my old house. I also used to make food for my friend who used to go to the same school and now lives in Massachusetts, but that was before he decided to create an elaborate sexual fantasy about me, after 5 years of normal friendship (is this outcome inevitable for me? Would suck if it is since a lot of women are rude to me like the one who got jealous of me and caused a crisis). I’m still a bit upset over that because I’m not sure if I should hang out with him if he now has this fantasy about me and I can’t reciprocate it at all. But I bet he will show up at some point so I’ll have to deal with it. The fantasy was some next level stuff in that a specific part of it would be considered disturbing by most people… But that’s on him I guess. One thing that cracked me up was my uncle’s explanation of his weight loss; he showed extreme and rapid improvement so I asked him how he achieved it. He claimed he lost all the weight using Zyns and edibles. At first, I didn’t understand this, because I could see how Zyns would lower your appetite but edibles would do the opposite. But, I think he replaced alcohol with edibles, and that’s how it worked. I thought it was funny that he got into the nicotine as a nootropic and dementia preventative, edibles, and shrooms microdosing shit at like 58 years old. But he is an interesting character and he made a cool painting for me which is in my room here. He’s even got an extension on his house which is a sauna and cold plunge - I think he was also into that Wim Hoff shit when he was in his keto diet craze (it’s this thing where you jump into ice water or take a cold shower to increase your dopamine levels or something). He’s a CEO despite all the drinking, and now edibles, that he’s done, and is very funny even though we got into a fight once that was super dramatic. Alright, I’m done typing, I’m basically just creating a diary entry and talking to myself with this shit, and it all started with an accident likely caused by the ex. Shit is so strange man. I’m off to watch erosion_of_earth videos - this is a guy on instagram who explains the processes or erosion and how specific natural features formed using hundreds of examples from Google Earth and it’s the most relaxing thing ever. I like to just space out as he explains how the ripples in some desert formed or how a river created something. I want to watch videos like that instead of pointless TikToks with vapid basic bitches twerking at the camera or whatever 🤢

1qal47w,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1qal47w/eating_out_is_so_expensive_lately/,Eating out is SO expensive lately !!!,"I remember about 10 years ago, I used to eat out a lot and it wasn't making a big dent in my account. Eating out was just convinient. I didn't have to think twice before eating out or just getting a coffee and snacks while doing chores.

Now, I earn 2x what I used to earn back then but eating out feels like I have to think twice, look at the restaurant menu in advance to make sure its not overly expensive and plan out my meal before I go to the restaurant. And also, I dont eat out much before its so expensive. And I work in tech, so get the usual tech salary but still it feels so expensive.  And this are mid-tier restaurant. Don't even get me stated on date nights, the restaurants with good ambiance for date nights are so expensive, easily getting over $130 for two people.

When searching for a new restaurant on Yelp, I look at their menu. Sometimes, the photo of the menu was posted 7-8 years ago and the prices back then were like 50-60% cheaper. (i.e. meaning that the prices now are 2x+)

But even with these prices, I see all the restaurants in bay area are always full. People are still eating out a lot. How is everyone able to afford eating out regularly?",69,1768191501.0,bayarea,69,0.88,False

This even occurs from someone you seemingly get along with. Sat at the office beside someone for instance, you share an interesting fun anecdote and then bam, awkward silence. These silences get louder and louder in their awkwardness the longer you're suspended in them.

They can last so long to the point where it becomes unbearable and uncomfortable. I work in an office and this occurs often. I can understand silence if someone is working but not to that extreme. My social anxiety is at peak at this point.

These silences can literally destroy any connection you thought you had with someone. Small talk as well by the coffee machine or in short bursts is so uncomfortable and yet its the 'shy 1' that's made the scapegoat.

Good and bad, nothing that bad but I think the reality of me growing up and becoming an adult is hitting me right smack in the face… who I am is so different from who I was yesterday, a month ago, a year ago. Moved out, new job, finances, growing apart from old friends and my immediate family. I find myself gravitating to stare at old photos of my life. It’s such a complex emotion. Both sad and happy. Anger and gratitude. I miss living in the same house as my sisters and being able to slip in each others rooms to giggle at 2am. I miss my childhood cat, I miss my teenage girl bedroom, I miss R Street and all the late nights spent laughing with friends about inexplicable conversations, I miss having an unserious job where I could fuck up and it be okay. I miss warm summer sunlight, I miss hammocking, missing my awkwardness and the way I was. Now I feel boring and less me. I miss Golden Pond. I miss all the time I had to just be myself. I miss the lake house, I miss when people used to see me and valued me. I feel plain and invisible. I go to work and go home. I am grateful for my partner and my home and my cat and dog and the life we have created together. But I fear I am in an awkward place. I am 22 now and I can feel my brain shifting from a silly teenage girl to a mature woman. I miss experiencing raw human emotions from anything I would do. I miss my creative pursuits - guitar, piano, bug pinning, working out. I am so drained from trying to keep up with life that I now lack the will to pursue what I once loved dearly. I miss the feeling of looking in the mirror and feeling magical, ethereal, and beautiful. Maybe my depression is creeping back or maybe it’s the time of the season of cold, dry, stale air making me feeling husk less and empty. I miss my bangs and my natural hair color. I miss when money wasn’t so important. I miss never having to question if I will be able to eat tonight. I miss when people want and need me to be in their life. Now I am just an afterthought. I miss being called and texted by people just because. I miss people respecting me and looking at me with a look of deep understanding because they can see me inside and out for who I am then and now. I miss humans and human connection that leaves you feeling like the sun is embracing you. Wrapping its warm rays to the skin covering my bones. I miss greenery and birds. I miss the smell of fresh cut lawns and rain. I miss my individuality. I miss when people would look not only into my eyes but into my soul, like the way a young child looks up at their parents, in a new world, untouched and unscathed by the true cruelty in all that humankind is. I miss when humans loved one another earnestly and honestly. I miss hearing the laughs of all the people I’ve ever met. I miss waking up and enjoying the coffee for what it tasted like and not for how it will make me feel. I miss late night games with innocent families and the joy of togetherness. I miss feeling strong and empowered instead of scared of what’s yet to come to fruition. That should be the beauty of life right? Not knowing what will happen in a day, a month, a year… but there is security in truly knowing what you want as a person. To wake up and know what needs to be done. I’ve been trying to pinpoint the source of my nostalgia but I think it’s a little of everything. Which is what makes it so hard for my brain to soothe itself when I can’t find the source of these feelings. I’m not depressed or unhappy with my life but I am also not satisfied in the way I thought you would feel as an emerging adult. Maybe I am taking life too seriously, but at the same time I can’t be unserious. The world wants and needs me to be serious but the reality is that everything on this planet is fabricated to benefit someone, somewhere. The contradictions of being me huh? I can’t be too unserious because then I’m annoying, but if I am too serious I am boring and letting my inner child down. Do you hear how complicated this all is… the jumble of my thoughts. I wish it were a physical knotted shoelace that I could untie, unraveling it and feeling satisfied. Do I just need time? I’m sure anyone at my age feels a little lost. I just can’t catch on or up like everyone else seems to be. I am a boat sinking and I am unsure the outcome or ‘fix’ I wish I could just wake up one day with the life altering epiphany.

1qako93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qako93/i_raised_my_hand_on_my_bf_coz_hes_too_gentle_and/,I raised my hand on my bf coz he's too gentle and polite?,"Hey. I'm 24f and my bf is 21m. For background, I come from a broken up family where my mom does drugs and dad has remarried. My bf comes from a asian family who moved here years ago but my bf used to stay with his grandpa in his own country and came here 5 years ago after his death.

His family lives in neighborhood and they're pretty well off. He was brought up in a very kind and gentle environment. His grandparents are the best people out there who were polite and loving their whole life and that reflects in his behavior and personality too.

His english is still a bit offshore, it's adorable and really really endearing when he looks for words to describe his feelings but ends up saying those in the wrong pronunciation. He's the prettiest thing ever...like really really pretty and absolutely charming.

We met through community work and I immediately wanted to know him more. Luckily we hit off good and I asked him out 3 months later. It's been 2 years now and we're still together. And mind you, he doesnt have many friends coz of communication skills and he's kind of an introvert too.

Thing is....he's too polite and gentle. Almost like a pushover.  He's still studying but I got myself a job now so whenever I've some extra work, I tell him to do it for me and he does it without another thought. Whenever I ask for money when I run low, he gives it with a smile. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I snap at him for asking if everything's alright. I snap at his mispronunciation, his mistakes with Grammer and sentences even though those arent even noticeable. I once threw a coffee down the drain coz I was pissed about my sister and then he messed up my coffee by trying to make try his 'back home' version of coffee.

Even for that he apologised later saying he shouldn't have pushed me for something I didnt want to do.

I hate it when people take a second look at him when we're out. He's pretty I know but he's mine right? And with how polite he is, he smiles at them and greets them nicely, unknowingly raising their hopes to approach him even more. 

These past few weeks, he's been learning crocheting to control his anxiety and he makes me the sweetest things like Keychains, bracelets and covers for my bottle. 

What made me hit him is..I know its really fcked up but I've been stressed immensely about my work place. The employees are judgemental and higher ups are too annoying so I'm pissed off most of the time of the day.

And when I come home, he immediately comes to my place and YAPS about his day and asks for mine, even brings me various new crochet stuff and mind you my desk and cupboard are now full of those little pretty things. I've started to get annoyed at those and want to tell him to stop but instead of telling him..Last night I just snapped and threw what he got me (a bow and cherry hairclip) out the window.

He was hurt and expressed it but chose the wrong word and that just..pissed me off more so I shouted at him to shut the help up. He was shocked, his face that I love so much had this..idk really confused and hurt look.

He stood up and gathered his stuff, apologised for coming but me being already worked up, I asked him where the hell was he going and he needs to sit his ass down until I calm down. 
I think he felt unsafe and kept muttering about now being not the time to talk and walked towards the door.

I dont know what came over me but I just yanked his hair and told him to sit on the couch and keep his mouth shut. He was scared, I saw the fear and idk..I think..I think I fed on it and snapped at him to sit and keep his mouth shut until I tell him to speak.

But he did open his mouth to say I was scaring him and he didn't feel good and I just, I dont know what happened but my anger flew off and I ended up slapping him while shouting at him to shut the hell up. Good thing...he pushed me off and ran away from me and my place.

I calmed down after an hour and two, realised what I did and how I treated him just for being loving and caring towards me. I went insane after hours and kept bombarding him with texts but he hasn't replied to any. I've tried calling but each goes to VM.

I know I'm the asshole here but I just wanna ask how do I fix it? Is there any chance to get him to forgive me? Coz i really really love him and I dont wanna let him go.",0,1768190230.0,Advice,21,0.31,False

Going to combine the four hikes I did into one post to save repeat posts as gear and conditions were nearly the same for all of it. 

**Where:** Southwest National Park + Walls of Jerusalem National Park, Tasmania

**When:** 2025-12-27 / 2026-01-09

**Distances:** 173km, 8539m elevation total

* 10.5km, 648m elevation (Cape Hauy) 
* 30.8km,  2108m elevation (Mt Anne Circuit), 
* 102.3km, 4327m elevation (South Coast Track), 
* 29.4km, 1456m (Walls of Jerusalem Loop)

**Conditions:** The most beautiful Tasmanian weather window, sun beaming every day bar the last (more on this later). Highs into the low 30s with lows around 10°C in the mornings. Snow experienced on Mt Anne. 

**Lighterpack:** [**https://lighterpack.com/r/pvm03y**](https://lighterpack.com/r/pvm03y)

**Photos:** [**https://imgur.com/a/nfnIJZ5**](https://imgur.com/a/nfnIJZ5)

**Transport:** Hire care mostly (biggest trip expense), with the Par Avion flight to Melaleuca and the Wilderness Experience bus from Cockle Ck. Be sure to book any transport between Hobart and Launceston as the Kinetic does sell out, which we nearly missed our bus due to.

**Day 0 - Cape Hauy**

Journey had to start a day later than planned due to Jetstar not bringing my check-in bag, but enabled us to do this awesome day hike which was a blessing in disguise. Minor showers didn't damper any mood and the views were incredible. 

**Day 1 - Condominium Ck to Shelf Camp**

Late start at around 3.30pm from trailhead, originally planned to stay at High Camp on Mt Eliza but made such good time we just continued on to Shelf Camp. Saw lots of snow which was super novel for December in Australia. No room left at shelf camp for the X-Mid 2P so had to rough out a cowboy camp and saw some beautiful stars.

**Day 2 - Shelf Camp to Condominium Ck**

Late wakeup for my party let my stuff dry off as I watched the sunrise. Snow on Mt Anne meant no summit unfortunately. Getting to the Notch was harder than the Notch itself, and the descent off Lightning ridge was quite energy sapping leading me to take a nap in the minimal shade at Lonely Tarns. The toilet situation there is dire with the black plastic absolutely baking in the sun leading to some very burnt bums. Managed to pack out from here with the miserable descent from Mt Sarah Jane and a 5km road run before being picked up for the last few km back to condo ck.

**Day 3 - Rest**

**Day 4 - Melaleuca to Point Eric**

The plane ride over was awesome, with the trail toward the beach being super stunning. Wish I took more photos here but wanted to conserve the camera battery. The tannin-stained water was super colourful and tasted delicious. Fresh baguette and hot dogs for dinner yum.

**Day 5 - Point Eric to Louisa River**

Saved a Maugean Skate from being beached on the way out of camp, although think it was missing its tail so not sure how well its gonna fare out there. Awesome side trip down to Louisa Bay, well worth the extra 7km. Would spend a night and extra day here just to go to Louisa Island in hindsight. Best meal of the trip with homemade dehydrated chilli next to the flowing river.

**Day 6 - Louisa River to Little Deadmans Bay**

Up onto the Ironbound was surprisingly easy due to a lovely path on the west side, with some great views for the final time of the Zebra Bay area and toward the Arthur's and Mt Anne. The descent was the toughest part of the trail, with high camp being a muddy shithole and low camp being somewhat habitable. Super yummy mountain water at high camp though, with little deadmans being a very pretty spot for a sunset looking over the headland at Pindars Peak (maybe?).

**Day 7 - Little Deadmans bay to Surprise Bay**

Easy walking onto Prion Beach and lucked into a group just finishing their boat crossing, meaning we only had to row through once. Took my first poo at Prion Campsight of the SCT, slightly concerning. Rolled my ankle twice quite badly from here on, so ignored the muddy detour to Osmiridium but was super rewarded by the most beautiful campsite at Surprise Bay which we had to ourselves. Great sunset once again and a swim at the slightly dangerous beach capped off a very nice day. Weird massive bone structure at this camp. 

**Day 8 - Surprise Bay to South Cape Rivulet**

The dreaded bog did not disappoint coming well beyond my rather tall waist at points. Granite beach was almost worse however, with my weakened ankles not enjoying the rocky terrain and then following the inlet too far up and missing the turnoff west taking me for a loop. Trackcutters camp must be a figment of the maps imagination as it does not exist to my  knowledge. Lots of overnighters from Cockle Ck at Sth Cape Rivulet.

**Day 9 - South Cape Rivulet to Cockle Ck via SE Cape**

Simple walk to the exit turnoff before contouring the coastline up to SE cape where a mad bushbash ensued. Pink and yellow markers detailed some kind of path, but a few too many encounters with the local wildlife (snakes, spiders, and aggressive birds) led us to turn back after about 3km into the forest. Boltons Green was completely chockers so had to camp on the beach and wait for our bus the next day, catching the end of the cricket.

**Day 10/11 - Rest**

**Day 12 - Fish River Rd to Lake Adelaide**

After being hyped up on Walls of Jerusalem by nearly everyone we'd talked to for the past 2 weeks I was slightly disappointed with the hike. The Temple is a must and was a nice view for about 30min as the sun started to fall. Mt Jerusalem was not really worth the additional detour and Dixons Kingdom was disgustingly busy and loud, leading us to continue on to Lake Ball Hut which was a mosquito pit and in near disrepair, leading us to go to Lake Adelaide. This campsite was might nicer, seeing a (albino?) wombat, and some sugar gliders on the trees, capping off a simple day of walking with some beers by the lake.

**Day 13 - Lake Adelaide to Fish River Rd**

We had planned to summit Mt Rogoona today and stay at Metsons Hut, but a lightning storm soured our plans and we hightailed it out of there completing the remaining 8km in just under 1.5h. Came across trail Jesus bare foot and long haired coming up from the carpark which was impressive. Fires on Cradle Mtn lead us to believe this was a good choice. Shame to see some vandalism due to the ongoing conflicts and the naming of this region. 

**Notes:**

* Boots not really needed for any of these hikes, the quick drying trail runners suited my party much better. In saying this the Sauconys gave me the worst most painful blisters of my life on my back heels, causing me to walk barefoot / with thongs / without insoles for many kms, leading to another 10 problems with my legs and feet.
* Packed a few too many things, but while definitely not UL I felt very comfortable with the weight across these distances. Need a lighter camera (required for me) and clothing system. 
* Not super happy with the X-Mid 2P due to the ginormous footprint making it harder to pitch in some campsites, but otherwise the gear was pretty solid. The quilt was more than warm enough and the thermals added super overkill. Could have gone a lighter pad too but this ones so comfy :)
* 2 fuel canisters were enough for my group (3) being quite liberal with our uses, making coffee every morning and tea in the evenings and boiling a lot during dinners. 
* 2 battery banks was too many for all my devices as I did not use the headtorch once due to the late sunsets. Ended up only charging my phone once due to listening to music for some of the shittier sections, the wireless earbuds drain the battery pretty heavy but better than having an annoying cord..  

**Food:**

* Luxury first nights as per, taking a baguette, hot dog rolls, and hot dogs. 
* Hungarian salami and sharp parmesan wraps made up lunches for the first 5 days, keeping more than well enough, could probably have pushed this to 6 or even 7 days. Super yummy and was a highlight of every day. Cant eat peanuts, but that would add a significant nutrients boost for those lucky enough to not be poisoned.
* Self-dehydrated chilli and spag bol went down a treat with browns mex rice and angel hair pasta, both heat up well on trail (add a splash of water to the rice, dont crowd the angel hair pot). 
* Got a bit silly with walls, taking 2L of grog and a 24 pack of doughnuts which went down a treat but was not worth the 3.5kg weight penalty. ",3,1768190108.0,UltralightAus,0,1.0,False

So, tomorrow is my work crush’s bday. I’ve been trying to find an in with her because we’ve chatted at work but haven’t exchanged numbers or anything like that. I know what her order is for our local coffee shop, however, and I’m thinking of surprising her with it for her bday because we are both working tomorrow. 

My thing is, I don’t want this to be outwardly romantic, I just want to make a friendly effort so that I can get to know her more and maybe develop into something more. But is this too much? Is it better for me to message her on our work channel and ask her if she wants anything from our local coffee shop for her bday on my way to work? I’m very socially anxious, so I’m probably overthinking, but I’d love some advice. Thanks!",2,1768189203.0,whatdoIdo,6,1.0,False

We don’t work in same office but same department and place. Anyways she always rants to me about my manager and I always listen etc and this one particular day I had a small argument with him so I messaged her to rant about him and I was very heightened. Anyways she was trying to play devils advocate in her responses and give me reasons as to why he felt that way and I guess as I was heightened I was just expecting validation and support from her. I didn’t say anything aggressive or say she’s wrong I maybe just came across in a way where I wasn’t taking advice (which I know can be annoying). Anyways it’s been 5 days now and she’s been giving me the silent treatment (not texting me, not asking me for coffee or lunch and when she came in the office she barely made eye contact and talked to me like I was a coworker she didn’t really know) and I actually don’t know what I did that was so wrong I should be ignored (yes maybe I was annoying and not take any advice but even just telling me that would have been better). I have quite bad social anxiety and don’t take this kind of thing well, I’ve been feeling horrible and guilty for days but I am also too afraid to approach her now after that. I guess I want to know if she’s valid in her reaction to ice me out like this and do I need to be sitting here feeling guilty for 5 days or should I just cut my losses and move on? Thanks!

1qak6of,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qak6of/need_our_first_real_espresso_machine_and_grinder/,Need our first real espresso machine and grinder [$1000],"Currently my gf and I have a Nespresso pod machine and are wanting to upgrade. Deciding between the Bambino and the Plus, due to the ease of learning on and the entry level price point, which will allow me to throw more money on a higher end grinder.

I’ve read the auto steamer on the Plus is programed for dairy milk, which we don’t use. And that the Plus might not have the instant hot water like the original Bambino? With being able to upgrade the steam wand tip, it seems the biggest advantage to the Plus would be the solenoid. Not sure that it’s worth an extra $200, or even $300 if I got a refurb Bambino from Breville. Any thoughts on that or any reason the extra money would be worth the Plus? Getting the Plus would lower my budget for a grinder though.

The grinder is what I really need recommendations on. If I don’t get the Plus, I can throw about $700 towards a grinder. I need something that can do more than just espresso grinds as I make cold brew, pour overs, and French press coffee. I’m hoping that price range gets me something that’s durable that will last and can be repairable myself with easily obtainable parts from the manufacture.

Thanks in advance!

I got married to my wife about a year ago but I’ve known her my whole life because our moms and good freinds. We went on vacations together and family trips and went to each others houses before but we never really directly interacted but she is best freinds with my sister (24 female)and they hang out a lot and I end up getting dragged along to these vacations and trips by my mom because in her words I’m introverted and I need to get out more . About a year ago a couple months before I married my now wife my mom and dad were pressuring me to get married also just for context I’m a Muslim man anyways they were pressuring me to get married but I’ve never really put any thought into the idea of marriage. Anyways by one day I was at my sisters house because she just gave birth to twins a boy and a girl and I went over there to help out with the kids so my bil and sister could relax but when I got there my now wife was already helping out and just so everyone knows my now wife has always been a hijabi and I’ve never seen her hair before we got married but I will a see y she’s a very attractive women and she’s not only physically attractive but her personality is so attractive and she’s just pulls people in when she talks to them anyways but ya so she was at my sisters house holding on of the baby’s and I went and sat on the couch opposite them and held the other baby and I heard my wife complaining about how her parents and pressuring her to marry but that she was scared of marrying someone she didn’t know for a while and my sister was telling her to just tell her parents to give her time but my now wife was stressing about how her grandmother was sick and in risk of dying and she wanted to see my now wife married before she would pass on. After I heard her talking to my sister about the situation I kind of zoned out and started thinking about how my own parents want me to marry soon too anyways but then at the end of the day at like 8:00 pm my now wife and I both decided to say goodbye to my sister and go to our perspective homes but my now wife had taken a uber to my sisters house cause her car was in the repair shop so I offered her a ride to her place and she accepted because we’ve known each other for years and I’ve driven her home countless times and as I was driving her to her place we started talking a little and I brought up how my parents also want me to get married and I told her about how I also don’t want to get married any time soon and we fell into a soothe running conversation after that and I need dropping her home and she said bye to me and I left for my home and I thought that was the end of our conversation about the marriage thing but I was so wrong. Fast forward a couple days I get a text from a unknown number and it’s her asking if we can meet for coffee and I initially thought It was weird because we’ve never gone anywhere together 1 on 1 so I tried asking her what it was about but she just told me to meet her and she’d tell me then and to summarize what happened she brought up how our family’s wanted us to find partners to marry soon and how we didn’t want to and she brought up the idea of us getting married but only on paper and just acting like a loving married couple but in reality we would just be married to stop all the marriage nagging from our family’s and she talked about how we would live together and show up to family and friend events together to make everyone believe we want each other and I honestly agreed immediately because I didn’t hate the idea of marry her because I’m already familiar with her and I’ve known her my whole life. So fast forward a couple mourns me and my now wife tell our parents we want to marry and there ecstatic and happy because in there words they always wished we would ended up together and my sister also agreed with them and a couple mouths later after countless hours of wedding planning we finally tided to knot and got married and my wife moved into my house for context I’m a engineer and I make really good money enough for us to live comfortably and my house is 2 stories and 5 bedrooms and most of the rooms are just guest rooms for when family comes to visited but my wife ended up moving into one of the rooms now after e got married is when the problems started. I got to see my wife without her hijab and she’s georgeous every morning I wake up and she in he kitchen making herself coffee and I just look at her cause I can’t believe I married someone so attractive she was pretty before I saw her without her hijab but now it’s on a different level and I feel so sexually and emotionally attracted to her also I need to mention that she brought up the idea of going on dates every Friday to get to know each other better so we can be more convincing in our loving marriage act and we get along great we have so many things in common and shes just so great and we spend hours talking to each other and I’d like to believe that she’s attracted to me the same way I am her I mean I’d like to think I’m not a other but I’m 6’3 and I work out regularly y because I used to play football in collage and was always in the gym so even after quitting football I still go to the gym regularly and shes even told me on our wedding day that she find me attractive anyways but now that we live together she dresses more confortably jn like shorts and tank tops and these legging ad shirt sets and overall she looks so good and it just make me so attracted ti her anyways but we’ve been getting along really well but the breaking point came when she had a minor surgery that required Anastasia and i went with her to the hospital and she went into surgery and it was a very minor surgery and after a couple hours they cleared us to go home and she was still under he jnfluence of Anastasia and they said she’s would be for a while so I took her home and when we got home it was already dark out so I ordered food us so she could eat and as I was carrying her from the house to the car she was taking and making jokes and just being so sweet and silly and I was talking with her and I helped her to her room and we were laughing the whole way up because of her just being so silly anyways but when we got up to her room and she wanted to change her clothes but she was being very sloppy because of the Anastasia so I helped her out her clothes and omg it was the biggest struggle to hold back from touching her in a sexual way she was so georgeous and beautiful but ima move but I put new clothes on her and I went with her down stairs because she wanted to watch out show (we watch secret lives of Mormon wives together) and I ended up falling asleep and when I woke up the next day I was in her room in her bed and she was laying directly above me and we both woke up real quick and she ended up sitting up on my lap and she ended up feeling  my you know and her eyes went wide and she looked down and she jumped off me and her face was like bright red and she started saying she was sorry and she didn’t realize she was sitting on my (you know) and I pulls her closer and told her it’s natural and that she doesn’t  have to be embarrassed and one thing led to another after that and she said some things and I said some things  and we ended up kissing and good lord it was the best kiss of my life but also the only kiss I’ve ever gotten from a women but still the best and after she turned beat red and started rambling about feelings and then I started talking about feelings and we both came to the conclusion that we have feelings for each other and that we want to explore them more so I ended up taking her to go get dinner  at this place we both love and it was done of the best nights of my life after dinner we ended up going home and we changed and grabbed ice cream and went to go watch a movie (10 thugs I hate about you it’s her fav movie) and one thing led to another and we ended up doing the devils tango and god help me it was one of the best nights of my life. Anyways if you made it this far me and my wife are still going strong and we started to start a real relation ship and it’s going so great anyways but the moral of my story is that you can find happiness in the most unexpected places. ,1,1768188785.0,ArrangedMarriageR4R,0,1.0,False

1qak56v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibew_apprentices/comments/1qak56v/did_i_do_the_right_thing/,Did I do the right thing?,"Myself (29yo/m 2nd year) and an old head JW (55+/f 40+year member) have had a bit of a ""cold war"" going on for about 2 weeks now. Firstly I will preface this with that I have been burned many times (part of other crews than this one) for doing what I'm told to do and what I was never told to do. By that I mean written up or chewed out for what happened at the time. Moving forward I have stuck to the old standard of I speak to and only take orders from the JW I am laid out with by the foreman during the PTP in the morning. If I am asked to do something during the day after being laid out with them, I ask my JW if its okay I take care of the new task for the person asking. There are general tasks for myself and another apprentice, we'll call him L for the sake of anonymity, in the crew to take care of daily. Such as remove trash, bring water bottles to the trailer we take break in, make sure coffee is made, clean the trailer, and gas the buggies (META job so we get pretty nice amenities).

 Fast forward to now, I'm attached to a new crew that I've been with for about 3 months now and I love it. I'm learning much more than I did before from very knowledgeable JW's. They know thier shit. They're also very knowledgeable about the union standards and follow them very closely, which is exactly what I wanted, to learn the union ways the right way. Previously I was attached to a pretty ratty crew filled with a bunch of freshly organized guys that didnt know the union ways quite yet themselves. That being said, this crew is a breathe of fresh air.

That brings us to now. We'll call the JW I'm putting heads with ""U"". U is from the old school ways. Meaning genuine abuse of the apprentices, talking to them like dirt, apprentices speaking to JWs only when spoken to. U has loosened those old standards a bit considering the crew were in. There were instances where there were numerous sly, passive aggressive remarks over the months that rubbed me the wrong way about the things L and I were doing or not doing up to U's standards. Silent tension on occasions that you could cut with a knife.

At times I was laid out with U for the day and there was a level of mutual respect during those times. That's all I wanted, was a bit of mutual respect. U saw that when I was asked to do something I did it promptly, adhering to the standard of ""workman-like manner"" which I hold dear. Told me at times that they were impressed by my knowledge of the union standards. All is good when were stuck together for the day.

Silent tensions grew, idk why. I don't belive I said or did anything intentionally or unknowingly to cause it. U used to have thier own buggy that they would work alone out of most of the time. That buggy broke down and a new foreman was popped up as our phenomenal previous foreman moved to GF. U had been generally happy with the buggy and old foreman. Ever since those 2 things changed U has been a nightmare to even ask simple questions to.

The new GF used to sit in a corner seat in the trailer. Once he moved up, I asked the other JWs in the trailer if they would like the seat before I moved over to it(it has a window that allowed me to get a single bar of service which is the only spot that o can get any in the trailer). So about 3 weeks ago I moved to that seat. On Wednesday last week U walks in the trailer first thing in the morning demanding I get up from the seat because it is now U's. My mind was at ""Fuck you, I asked and I've been here 2 weeks."" Sensibility took hold and after what felt like forever I simply stood up, gathered my things and put them in my tool bag outside in the gang box. I said nothing. I was kind of appaled at the abrasive manner that I was TOLD to get up. I will always give up a seat to a JW when asked. Nicely or not. Thats just the way it is. Everyone in the trailer heard the altercation. After the altercation the new foreman asked why I was sitting outside in the buggy. I explained the situation and asked to not be paired up with U anymore. I did preface my request with ""I am an apprentice, and I will follow your orders if you need me to be paired with them for the day. I will listen to and follow the same standards an apprentice always should with the JW they are laid out with."" He understood and agreed. Apparently there had been other issues with other people with U. He mentioned that, hut did not give details what those were. From understanding those also pertained to ""swing her dick around.""

Friday, it was early morning. I came in to find we were low on water and trash needed to be taken out. We needed about 6 cases of water. I walked over to L, which was right next to U's pilfered spot, and asked ""Hey L, you mind helping me bring some water in?"" I then walked out to get started. On my way back to the trailer, 3 cases of water in hand, U smoking a cigarette stopped me. ""You are not a JW. You do not tell MY apprentice what to do."" I simply said ""ok"" and kept moving. Apparently after I left the trailer U was in a bit of a fit over ""telling"" L what to do. Water is heavy. I just asked for help. With a task that both apprentices are expected to do without being asked. As I'm walking back after trash I see my foreman. He asks how my morning is, I tell him what just occurred. He said ""thanks for letting me know, I'll handle it.""

Apparently he discussed it with U. Also, other JW's that I spoke with about the situations had spoken to U about easing up as well. I only told 2 other really good brothers about what happened because I feel closer to them and I was looking for insight. Apparently after that U had decided to literally never speak to me again.

As of today, U did not speak to me at all and actively avoided me. Only speaking to other JW's passively within ear shot of me about things the crews apprentices are doing wrong. Its clear U didn't mean L. The only words I spoke to U were this morning when U hopped in the buggy to head back to the trailer were ""Are we expecting anyone else?"" All I got was silence. It's Sunday and not everyone works Sunday. I know U likes to get to the trailer early, but its more important to me that no brother/sister gets left behind. So I waited and waited until G hopped in. I asked G if we're expecting anyone else, he says no. I started to the trailer. Not to mention I've asked U not to smoke cigarettes in the buggy with me because they make my clothes stink and I don't smoke. U smoked 2. I did not ask today, that was previously.

This is not what I wanted. I did not want it to be this way. I know at heart U is a great sister. Very knowledgeable and a fantastic person to learn from. Strong union standards. Attention to detail and a mind to only install quality work. I genuinely believe that. I just needed the heavy handed bullshit to stop. I can deal with getting my balls busted and a deserved verbal lashing. Thats part of the gig. This was different though. Very intentional and very direct. I knew the views on apprentice speaking to JW that U has, so I took it to my foreman. 

Before and after all of this, I still only speak the truth of what happend and with reverence to U or anyone else about U. I embellish nothing about it, because that only strays from the truth. I have no ill intent or personal issues with U. I don't know what U has going on outside of work that may cause that, but I always keep that in mind about anyone at work. 

I know this is a long read, so I appreciate anyone that took the time. So my question is, Did I do the right thing? If not what could I have done better?",2,1768188690.0,ibew_apprentices,10,0.67,False

1qak4dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1qak4dy/garmin_nutrition_update/,Garmin nutrition update,"I posted last week that I'd signed up for the trial of Garmin Connect+ due to the new nutrition logging. I also said I don't log religiously and that continues to be the case. So long term there will be little value, I think.

All that said I've had some surprising, in a good way, results and a head scratch moment.

**The main head scratcher:**

I can create ""My Meals"" by adding ingredients and giving g the meal a name. e.g. ""Coffee"" = espresso shot + 10ml cream. In the feed though, both ingredients are displayed. I'd expect to see only ""Coffee"". If I have 3 of these in the morning I get 6 entries. I can't see a way to collapse them into just their meal names. 

I would imagine this is an oversight and they'll fix it pretty quickly - or I am missing something. It's happened before! 

**The ""whoa"" (good) moments:**

1. I went to a frozen yoghurt chain the other day (Yo-Chi for those in Australia). You put the yoghurt into a tub then add as many toppings as you like. You pay by weight! The picture of mine is below! Garmin found most of the ingredients after just a few seconds of processing. (Gummie bears, Kiwi fruit, Chocolate flavoured sprinkles, strawberries, Frozen yoghurt, sugar free caramel).It can only asses what it set and some ingredients were hidden. But I was stunned at how accurate it was based on the challenges.

2. It also correctly identified any wife's home made biscotti.

3. The speed of scanning a barcode is so good, I was ""waiting for it"" and it had already correctly scanned the whey protein powder.

**Summary**

I'll let the subscription lapse. I don't obsess about logging food. I'll weigh something and then just eyeball it from there for later meals.

One spring day in Osavine, Claire Miller sat in the Miller Mansion’s cozy drawing room. She sat by the fireplace, reading an Anglic book with full attention.

Suddenly, a large envelope slammed onto the coffee table in front of her with a loud bang, the gust of wind stirring the hair by her cheeks.

“You don’t belong here. Get out of this house,” Ashley Miller shouted as she marched toward Claire.

“Ashley, what are you making a scene about now?” Claire’s voice was soft, but a slight frown touched her brow as she looked up at Ashley, her elder sister.

The Miller family had three children. Samuel Miller, the eldest, was in college. Ashley, the second, was in high school. And Claire was the youngest.

“Claire Miller, no, Claire Brown. You’re not my sister at all. Get out of here, right now, this minute.” Ashley pointed fiercely toward the door.

Claire went still. She picked up the envelope from the coffee table and opened it. Her eyes narrowed in shock. Inside was a document showing she was not a Miller by blood.

Adam Miller and Jennifer Miller stepped into the living room just then, with a shy, plainly dressed girl trailing behind them. The girl was about Claire’s age.

Claire rose to her feet, holding the document high. “Dad, Mom, is this true?” she asked, her voice trembling. She couldn’t believe the words on the page.

Jennifer’s eyes were red as she took Claire’s hand. “Darling, I can’t believe it either,” she said, her voice thick. “I’ve treasured you like a precious gem for fifteen years. How can you not be my own?”

Adam’s face was stern. “Since it’s a mistake, it must be set right,” he stated firmly. “Your real parents are outside, waiting for you.”

“Hurry up and go. This is my real sister,” Ashley cut in sharply. Pulling the quiet Livia Miller forward, she staged a tight, sisterly hug for Claire to see.

Livia kept her head down, as if she didn’t dare look Claire in the eye. But inside, she was laughing wildly. ‘I’m finally back. Last time, I was stupid and died soon after returning to the Millers. This time, I’ll make sure I stay as the richest man’s daughter.’

Claire looked at each of them, then gently pulled her hand away from Jennifer’s hold. “If it’s a mistake, then it should be fixed,” she said softly. Her voice was still sweet, but her tone was steady. Jennifer seemed unable to let go.

“Just get out. Go back to your poor family,” Ashley snapped. “You’ve got eight brothers who eat like they’ve never seen food. Watch out, Claire, your new parents might just sell you off for their sake.” She looked ready to drag Claire out herself.

Without another word, Claire walked straight out of Miller Mansion. At the gate stood a middle-aged couple waiting. The man wore work clothes, and the woman was dressed plainly.

Both of them were good-looking. When they saw Claire, their expressions grew complicated, but they stepped forward at once.

“Are you Claire?” asked Joyce Brown, Claire’s birth mother. After Claire nodded, Joyce took her hand. “Come, let’s go home.”

Henry Brown, Claire’s birth father, added, “Yes, let’s go home and talk.” And so, Claire followed her real parents back to where they lived.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Browns lived in a small, three-room rented apartment down an alley off Qranta Road, near Osavine High School. There were eleven people in the family altogether.

Before Claire’s arrival, the room arrangement had remained unchanged for years: her parents shared one, Livia had her own, and all eight brothers slept in the third.

The floor was peeling at the edges. The walls were scuffed, with a few old posters stuck to them. The room was full of worn-out things: a sagging couch, a shaky table, and an old TV.

Shabby as it was, the place was tidy and clean. It couldn’t have been more different from the grand Miller Mansion. In that moment, the huge gap between rich and poor felt real and stark.

“I know it’s not what you’re used to,” Henry said with a gentle smile. “Your mother always says education comes first. Every penny we earn goes toward the children’s schooling.”

Joyce nodded. “Just because we’re poor now doesn’t mean we will always be. If you and your brothers work hard at your studies, one day things will get better.”

Henry nodded eagerly. “Yes, your mom’s right about that.” Claire understood quickly: here, Joyce was the strict one, and Henry the soft one. Back at the Millers’, it had been just the opposite.

Joyce guided Claire to a chair. “Let me tell you how things are with us,” she began. “Your father works at a factory. He brings home about two thousand a month.

“I do some small business. My pay isn’t regular. Some months it’s a few hundred, others it can be four thousand. We rent this place. We don’t own anything, but we don’t owe anyone, either. And you have eight brothers.”",1,1768188505.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

One spring day in Osavine, Claire Miller sat in the Miller Mansion’s cozy drawing room. She sat by the fireplace, reading an Anglic book with full attention.

Suddenly, a large envelope slammed onto the coffee table in front of her with a loud bang, the gust of wind stirring the hair by her cheeks.

“You don’t belong here. Get out of this house,” Ashley Miller shouted as she marched toward Claire.

“Ashley, what are you making a scene about now?” Claire’s voice was soft, but a slight frown touched her brow as she looked up at Ashley, her elder sister.

The Miller family had three children. Samuel Miller, the eldest, was in college. Ashley, the second, was in high school. And Claire was the youngest.

“Claire Miller, no, Claire Brown. You’re not my sister at all. Get out of here, right now, this minute.” Ashley pointed fiercely toward the door.

Claire went still. She picked up the envelope from the coffee table and opened it. Her eyes narrowed in shock. Inside was a document showing she was not a Miller by blood.

Adam Miller and Jennifer Miller stepped into the living room just then, with a shy, plainly dressed girl trailing behind them. The girl was about Claire’s age.

Claire rose to her feet, holding the document high. “Dad, Mom, is this true?” she asked, her voice trembling. She couldn’t believe the words on the page.

Jennifer’s eyes were red as she took Claire’s hand. “Darling, I can’t believe it either,” she said, her voice thick. “I’ve treasured you like a precious gem for fifteen years. How can you not be my own?”

Adam’s face was stern. “Since it’s a mistake, it must be set right,” he stated firmly. “Your real parents are outside, waiting for you.”

It was a familiar type of ache. I asked him what he did and he flooded and entire pot of coffee with turmeric! Like why!

This boy (and i say boy because he has the maturity of a doorknob) would continue to have children and would get his girlfriend pregnant while being unemployed, and she is unable to work, living in the worst conditions possible. Their eldest is living with family members across the country, not even under their care because of money and poor living conditions. Would beg people on social media to give them money to pay for food for themselves and baby. Meanwhile the father cant hold down a job because of his attitude and refuses to work fast food due to ""allergies to coffee"". Which isnt true btw he is making excuses. Then had made posts about their baby not eating for 24 hours because they had no bottles etc. My heart felt for them to an extent but it was mind-blowing. 

This guy would message me and seek support but I always was a hard a** because I knew he kept getting his gf pregnant on purpose to have a large family, which has been his dream. Anytime id tell him he needs to financially be stable he would then say ""but I want a large family."" The intelligence is just not there. 

Sadly he would act all smart and prepared with grand plans and would try and make businesses but would always fail. He lost his license due to reckless driving and became dependent on Marijuana and would spend most of his limited government welfare funds on it. Needless to say, both parents are idiots and as a professional child educator im obligated to report regardless if im on or off shift. 

(It took over a year for anything to be done, thankfully the kids are out of their care.)

Why are people having babies if they arent financially prepared? Why are people having babies if they cant even feed themselves? (Plus their hydro was cut off so...no heat...which in my country is extremely unsafe)

I'm 24f and my bf is 21m. For background, I come from a broken up family where my mom does drugs and dad has remarried. My bf comes from a asian family who moved here years ago but my bf used to stay with his grandpa in his own country and came here 5 years ago after his death.

His family lives in neighborhood and they're pretty well off. He was brought up in a very kind and gentle environment. His grandparents are the best people out there who were polite and loving their whole life and that reflects in his behavior and personality too.

His english is still a bit offshore, it's adorable and really really endearing when he looks for words to describe his feelings but ends up saying those in the wrong pronunciation. He's the prettiest thing ever...like really really pretty and absolutely charming.

We met through community work and I immediately wanted to know him more. Luckily we hit off good and I asked him out 3 months later. It's been 2 years now and we're still together. And mind you, he doesnt have many friends coz of communication skills and he's kind of an introvert too.

Thing is....he's too polite and gentle. Almost like a pushover.  He's still studying but I got myself a job now so whenever I've some extra work, I tell him to do it for me and he does it without another thought. Whenever I ask for money when I run low, he gives it with a smile. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I snap at him for asking if everything's alright. I snap at his mispronunciation, his mistakes with Grammer and sentences even though those arent even noticeable. I once threw a coffee down the drain coz I was pissed about my sister and then he messed up my coffee by trying to make try his 'back home' version of coffee.

Even for that he apologised later saying he shouldn't have pushed me for something I didnt want to do.

I hate it when people take a second look at him when we're out. He's pretty I know but he's mine right? And with how polite he is, he smiles at them and greets them nicely, unknowingly raising their hopes to approach him even more. 

These past few weeks, he's been learning crocheting to control his anxiety and he makes me the sweetest things like Keychains, bracelets and covers for my bottle. 

What made me hit him is..I know its really fcked up but I've been stressed immensely about my work place. The employees are judgemental and higher ups are too annoying so I'm pissed off most of the time of the day.

And when I come home, he immediately comes to my place and YAPS about his day and asks for mine, even brings me various new crochet stuff and mind you my desk and cupboard are now full of those little pretty things. I've started to get annoyed at those and want to tell him to stop but instead of telling him..Last night I just snapped and threw what he got me (a bow and cherry hairclip) out the window.

He was hurt and expressed it but chose the wrong word and that just..pissed me off more so I shouted at him to shut the help up. He was shocked, his face that I love so much had this..idk really confused and hurt look.

He stood up and gathered his stuff, apologised for coming but me being already worked up, I asked him where the hell was he going and he needs to sit his ass down until I calm down. 
I think he felt unsafe and kept muttering about now being not the time to talk and walked towards the door.

I dont know what came over me but I just yanked his hair and told him to sit on the couch and keep his mouth shut. He was scared, I saw the fear and idk..I think..I think I fed on it and snapped at him to sit and keep his mouth shut until I tell him to speak.

But he did open his mouth to say I was scaring him and he didn't feel good and I just, I dont know what happened but my anger flew off and I ended up slapping him while shouting at him to shut the hell up. Good thing...he pushed me off and ran away from me and my place.

I calmed down after an hour and two, realised what I did and how I treated him just for being loving and caring towards me. I went insane after hours and kept bombarding him with texts but he hasn't replied to any. I've tried calling but each goes to VM.

I know I'm the asshole here but I just wanna ask how do I fix it? Is there any chance to get him to forgive me? Coz i really really love him and I dont wanna let him go.",0,1768188228.0,AmIOverreacting,31,0.18,False
1qajz8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_somethinggoeshere2/comments/1qajz8v/the_little_black_church/,The Little Black Church,"""There are many types of greed, Charlie."" My father said, standing in my doorway.

He worked ten or twelve-hour days, six days a week. We barely talked. I'd find him passed out on the living room couch, or at the kitchen table with a beer, eyes on the newspaper but not really seeing it.

""The worst kind of greed is the greed of the rich man. A poor man, or a working man, we can get a little more than what we got and be thankful. A rich man? That hunger can never be filled. It's like a fire or,"" he struggled, looking for the right words, ""or a bottomless pit. No matter how much they get, they always want more. And the more they get, the more they want.""

I looked up from the floor, where I was sitting with a book for school. White Fang, I think. He had a beer in his hand. His eyes were rheumy, face flushed. A couple beers in, he'd get like this. He wasn't drunk, just tipsy enough to remember he had a son, and he needed to do Dad things, and dispense Dad advice.

""Dad, you should lie down."" I said, ""You look exhausted.""

He closed his eyes and nodded slowly. He was always exhausted.

""I love you, son. I know I don't say that enough, but I do.""

""I love you too, Dad,"" I replied.

We buried him the next summer. He fell asleep at the wheel and went into a ditch on his drive home from work. I was sixteen that year. Mom was, of course, devastated.

He had a whole storage unit of bits and pieces of his life, a storage unit that we couldn't afford anymore. Mom drove me out there one afternoon, a few weeks after the funeral. The stuff she wanted to save went into the trunk. Boxes and boxes of stuff. We went through everything. The air was thick with dust motes.

He painted in college. My father, who would sit with a thousand-yard stare at the dinner table after a brutal day at work, had been a pretty good artist back then. There were a couple of landscapes, a few portraits of people I didn't recognize, but that my mom said were distant relatives, and half a dozen paintings of the same building.

A little black church. It was squat, square, and plain. An unassuming building. The kind of tiny country church that could fit no more than a couple of dozen people. I knew my father was from the boonies, way out in the country.

""Mom, where is this church?"" I asked, tilting the painting up.

She glanced over and squinted at the painting. ""That's from when your dad was a kid. A church near where he grew up.""

""He went there?""

""I guess so. He painted it enough."" She turned back to the box she was sorting through. ""Your father didn't really talk about his childhood. I met him at college. He'd already left all that behind by then. He wasn't close to his family.""

I stared at the painting. Just a small, dark building in the middle of nowhere. We went to my Mom's folks every year. I'd never met my Dad's family. They had barely showed up at his funeral.

""That's what makes all these paintings so strange."" She paused, wiping the sweat from her forehead. ""He must have done them early in college, before we met. After that, he never painted churches again. Just landscapes. Pretty sunsets. Normal stuff.""

""You ever ask him about it?""

""A few times."" She stood there quietly, staring at nothing. ""He'd just change the subject. He was good at that.""

He was excellent at that.

I couldn't throw them away. Someday they'd end up in someone else's trash pile, forgotten. But not yet. I hung them in my bedroom. All six paintings, arranged on the wall above my desk, where I'd see them while doing homework. Mom came in one night, stood in the doorway looking at them. She didn't say anything for a long time.

""You really want those up?"" she finally asked.

""Yeah.""

She nodded and left. We didn't talk about them again.

Two years passed. The paintings stayed on my wall. I graduated, applied to colleges, got accepted. Mom wrapped each one in newspaper when I packed. Everything I owned went into the back of her car. She drove me three hours north and helped me carry the boxes up four flights of stairs to my dorm room.

Mom hugged me at the door. ""Call me on Sundays.""

""I will.""

She looked at me for a second, then left. I unpacked the paintings last. Hung them on the wall above my desk in two rows of three.

I called my mom most Sundays.

""How's school?"" she asked one Sunday in my junior year.

""Good. I'm graduating in May.""

""Your father would be proud.""

She always said that. I never knew if it was true.

""Hey, something weird happened last week,"" she said. ""Some of your dad's family showed up at the house.""

""What? Who?""

""I don't know. A man and a woman. They said they were his cousins. Wanted to go through his things, see if there was anything they could have. After four years.""

""What did you tell them?""

""I told them to leave. It felt wrong, Charlie. They weren't at the funeral. They never called, never sent a card. Now they want his stuff?""

I stared at the paintings on my wall. ""Did they say what they were looking for?""

""No. Just that they wanted something to remember him by."" She paused. ""They asked about you too. Where you were going to school, what you were studying. I didn't like it.""

""You didn't tell them anything, right?""

""Of course not. I'm not stupid."" She sighed. ""It just bothered me. Why now? What changed?""

I didn't have an answer for her.

I packed up my dorm room in May. Everything fit in the back of a borrowed pickup truck. The paintings came down last. I wrapped each one in newspaper, careful with the frames. I was carrying the last one down the stairs when my phone rang. I shifted the painting to one hand and dug my phone out with the other. My foot caught the edge of a step. The painting hit the landing before I did. The frame splintered.

""Shit.""

I crouched down and picked through the pieces. The canvas was fine, just some scratches. I pulled it free from the broken frame and something fell out. A piece of paper, yellowed and folded small. It had been tucked behind the canvas, invisible until now. I unfolded it. My father's handwriting.

>*Honey, If you're reading this, I'm probably dead. I should have burned these paintings years ago, but I couldn't. They're proof of where I came from, and I needed to remember why I left.*

>*I ran from that church. I had to. The things they believed, the things they did, I couldn't be part of it anymore. I couldn't raise a family there. I couldn't let them touch my life.*

>*If they ever come looking for you, don't go back. Don't try to understand. Just run like I did. Protect yourself. Protect Charlie. That's all that matters.*

>*I'm sorry I never told you. I thought if I stayed quiet, if I never mentioned it, they'd forget about us. Maybe I was wrong.*

My phone was still on the ground where I'd dropped it. I picked it up and called my mom back.

""Mom,"" I said. ""Tell me about Dad's family again. The ones who came to the house.""

""What? Why?""

""Just tell me.""

""They were strange. The woman did most of the talking. She had this accent, a really thick southern drawl. She kept smiling, but it didn't reach her eyes. The man just stood there and stared at me.""

""What did they look like?""

""Old. Fifty, sixty, maybe. Dressed like they were going to church. Very modest. Very religious looking, I guess.""

I looked down at the letter in my hand.

""Charlie, what's going on?""

""I don't know yet,"" I said. ""But I'm going to find out.""

I found a forum where people researched obscure religious movements. I posted a picture of one of the paintings and said I was looking for information about my father's childhood. Three days later, someone sent me an image. No message, just an attachment. A photograph of a handwritten list. Names in two columns, maybe thirty or forty total. Some had lines drawn through them. My father's name was third from the top. Crossed off.

I searched the marked out names. Found seventeen matches. All of them had been born in the same cluster of small towns. All of them had left and started new lives somewhere else. Then they vanished, or died under suspicious circumstances. Sometimes twenty years after they'd gone. Sometimes thirty. A sick feeling settled in my stomach. Maybe it hadn't been an accident.

A letter arrived two weeks later. My name and my apartment address written in neat, careful script. The postmark was from a town I didn't recognize, somewhere in the south. I opened it standing in my kitchen.

>*Dear Charlie,*

>*Your mother probably mentioned we stopped by to see her recently. We should have reached out sooner - we know it's been years since your father passed, and we're sorry we weren't there for you both during that time. We've been thinking about your dad a lot lately. He was family, even if we didn't always see eye to eye when he was younger. We'd love to share some stories about him with you, if you're interested. We have some old photographs we thought you might like to see. We'll be passing through your area next month for a church retreat. If you'd like to meet for dinner, we'd enjoy getting to know you. No pressure at all - we understand if the timing doesn't work. God bless, Thomas and Sarah.*

There was a phone number at the bottom.

I didn't call the number. I sat on my apartment floor with the letter in my hands. They knew where I lived. They knew where my mother lived, and they had a list with my father's name crossed off.

I packed a bag. I needed to figure out what was going on, and I was on my own.

I told my mom I was taking a road trip. Seeing the country before job hunting started. She thought it was a good idea, said I'd earned a break. I didn't tell her where I was going. Didn't tell her about the letter, or the list, or why I was really leaving.

The drive took two days. I could have done it in one if I'd pushed, but I didn't want to arrive exhausted. The landscape changed as I drove south. Flat farmland gave way to rolling hills, then thick forests that pressed close to the highway. Small towns appeared and disappeared, each one looking more tired than the last. I stopped for the night at a motel off the interstate. Sleep didn't come easy.

The next morning, I drove the last hundred miles. State highways, then county roads, then roads that barely had names. The trees got thicker. Houses became sparse, set back from the road behind long gravel driveways. I passed a hand-painted sign: ""Welcome to God's Country.""

Twenty minutes later, I found the town. A gas station, a post office, a Dollar General, and a diner that looked like it had been there since the 1950s. Everything else was houses and churches. Lots of churches. I drove through slowly. People on the sidewalk stopped and watched my car pass. Strangers probably didn't come through here often.

The motel was on the edge of town. Single-story, L-shaped building with maybe a dozen rooms. The sign out front said ""Trav-A-Lot Motel."" The paint was peeling and half the letters were burned out. I sat in the car for a minute. If these people were as connected as I thought, they'd hear about a stranger in town. Probably already had. I'd register under my mother's maiden name. Pay cash. No paper trail.

I grabbed my wallet and went into the office. A bell above the door chimed. The woman behind the counter looked up from a crossword puzzle. ""Can I help you?""

""I need a room. Just a few nights.""

Her gaze was judgmental.  ""Passing through?""

""Something like that.""

""Fifty a night. Cash or card?""

""Cash.""

She pulled out a registration form and slid it across the counter with a pen. ""Fill this out.""

I made up an address in a town two states over. Left my real phone number in case I needed them to reach me.

She counted out the bills and handed me a key attached to a plastic tag with a faded number 7 on it.

""You here for work?""

""Just visiting.""

""Family?""

""Yeah.""

She nodded and wrote out a receipt. ""Well, welcome to town. There's a diner down the road if you need a real meal. Everything else closes by eight.""

""Thanks.""

I took the key and went to find my room. Thin carpet, floral bedspread that didn't match the curtains, a TV bolted to the dresser. The bathroom was small and clean. I dropped my bag on the bed and sat down. My phone had one bar of signal. I pulled up the image of the list, stared at it for the hundredth time. My father's name, crossed off. All those other names. Some crossed off, some waiting.

I was here. Now what?

I decided to get food first. Figure things out on a full stomach. The diner was easy to find, right on the main road. Half a dozen pickup trucks in the parking lot. I went inside. The conversations dropped when I walked in. People looked up, then went back to their meals. I sat at the counter.

A waitress came over, an older woman with gray hair pulled back in a bun. Her name tag said ""Linda.""

""What can I get you, honey?""

""Coffee and a burger. Whatever's good.""

""Everything's good here."" She smiled. ""You just get into town?""

""Yeah. Staying at the motel for a few days.""

""Visiting family?""

""Something like that,"" I said.

She nodded and went to put in my order. I sipped my coffee and looked around. The walls were covered in old photographs. The town in different eras. My burger came. I ate it slowly, listening to the surrounding conversations. Mostly talk about work, weather, whose kid was doing what. Normal small-town stuff. There was an undercurrent I couldn't quite place. The way people's eyes would flicker toward me, then away. The way conversations seemed to pause when I shifted in my seat.

I paid my bill in cash and left. Drove around for a while, getting my bearings. Eventually found the church, about three miles outside town. Set back from the road behind a chain-link fence, just like in my father's paintings. Small, square, black-painted wood. A gravel parking lot with weeds growing through the cracks. No sign out front. No indication of what it was called or when services were held. I didn't stop. Just drove past, slow enough to take it in. I headed back to the motel.

The sun was going down. I stood at the window and looked out at the motel parking lot. Two other cars besides mine. No one moving around. The whole town felt like it was shutting down for the night. Tomorrow, I'd go to the church. Try to blend in. Find out what they wanted. Find out what my father had been so afraid of. Tonight, I tried to sleep.

I woke up before the alarm, showered in the tiny bathroom, and put on the closest thing I had to church clothes. Dark jeans, button-down shirt. I looked at myself in the mirror. I looked like my father. Same jaw, same eyes, same way of standing with my shoulders slightly hunched. If anyone there remembered him, they'd recognize me. If someone did recognize my face, I could claim distant relation, say I was looking into family history. Give myself room to back out if things felt wrong. It wasn't much of a plan. But at least it was something.

I drove to the church at nine-thirty. Service started at ten. The parking lot had maybe a dozen cars in it. All older models, all clean despite the dirt roads. I parked at the edge and sat there for a minute, hands on the wheel. This was stupid. I should turn around, drive home, forget about all of it.

The front door was propped open. I could hear singing inside, voices raised in a hymn I didn't recognize. I walked up the three concrete steps and went in. The interior was plain. Wooden pews, maybe fifteen rows. A simple pulpit at the front. No stained-glass, no decorations except for a large wooden cross on the wall behind the pulpit.

Maybe twenty people scattered through the pews. Families mostly. A few older couples. Everyone dressed modestly. I was underdressed. A few heads turned as I walked in. An older man near the back gestured to the empty space beside him. I nodded and sat down.

The singing continued. I didn't know the words, so I just stood there while everyone around me sang. The hymn ended, and everyone took a seat. A man at the front, middle-aged with thinning hair and a kind face, stepped up to the pulpit.

""Let us pray.""

Everyone bowed their heads. I did the same. The prayer was long. Standard stuff about grace and mercy and walking in the light. Nothing that raised any flags. When it ended, the preacher launched into a sermon about the Book of Revelation. The end times. The tribulation. How the faithful would be saved and the wicked would face judgment.

Halfway through, people started speaking in tongues. Just a few at first, scattered through the congregation. Nonsense syllables that rose and fell in rhythm with the preacher's words. Then more joined in. Within a minute, maybe half the room was doing it. I'd seen speaking in tongues before. It usually lasted a minute or two, then people would quiet down. This didn't stop. It built. Got louder. The voices started to synchronize, falling into the same rhythm, the same cadence. It stopped sounding like random utterances and started sounding like a chant.

The preacher kept talking, his voice rising to be heard over the congregation. He wasn't trying to quiet them, I realized. He was encouraging it. His words shifted from English to something else, the same nonsense syllables everyone else was speaking. The air in the church felt thick. My head started to ache, a dull pressure behind my eyes.

The woman in front of me was shaking. Her hands raised, her head thrown back. The sounds coming from her mouth didn't sound human. I wanted to leave. Getting up and walking out would draw attention. So I stayed in my seat and tried to breathe through it.

The chanting reached a peak, then suddenly stopped. Complete silence. The preacher lowered his head, placed both hands on the pulpit. When he looked up, he was smiling.

""The Spirit is with us today, brothers and sisters. Let us give thanks.""

Everyone murmured agreement. The woman in front of me sat down, calm now. The preacher stepped down from the pulpit. The service seemed to be ending. People started to gather their things, shake hands, talk quietly among themselves.

Behind the pulpit, a door at the back of the church opened. A man stepped through. He wore a white suit. Immaculate, spotless. He also wore a pale mask that covered his entire face. No features, just smooth white surface with two holes for eyes.

The congregation went quiet again. The silence changed into something reverent. Expectant. The man in the mask walked slowly to the pulpit. His gaze swept across the pews, row by row. When his eyes passed over me, I felt a weight, like something pressing against my skull.

""Brothers and sisters,"" he said. His voice was deep, southern accent thick and smooth. ""We gather here in the shadow of the Almighty. We stand at the edge of eternity. The great work continues, and we are blessed to be part of it.""

He raised one hand.

""Let us give thanks for what has been provided. Let us prepare for what is to come.""

The congregation responded in unison. It wasn't exactly words. More like a low hum that vibrated through the building. I felt it in my chest, in my teeth. The man in the mask began to speak. It wasn't English or tongues. Something stranger. The sounds were incomprehensible, syllables that didn't fit together, rhythms that made my head pound harder.

Images flashed in my mind. Something moving in darkness. Something vast and wet and ancient. Movement in the deep. Something rising. Something hungry.

I closed my eyes and tried to block it out. Closing my eyes made it worse. The image was clearer in the dark. The chanting ended abruptly. I opened my eyes. The man in the mask was looking directly at me. For several seconds, neither of us moved. Then he lowered his hand and stepped back from the pulpit. He turned and walked through the door behind him. It closed with a soft click.

The congregation started moving again. People stood, gathered their things, headed for the exits. Like nothing unusual had happened.

The man beside me stood and offered his hand. ""Welcome. I don't think we've met.""

I shook his hand. ""Charlie. Just visiting.""

He nodded slowly. ""You look familiar. You got family around here?""

""Distant relatives, I think. I'm trying to track down some family history. Thought I'd start by visiting local churches.""

""Well, you came to the right place. Lots of old families around here."" He smiled. ""I'm Tom. You should come back for evening service. Six o'clock. More informal. Good chance to meet people, ask around about your folks.""

""I'll think about it.""

""You do that."" Tom patted my shoulder and walked away.

I stood there for another minute, waiting for my head to clear. The pressure was fading, slowly. Like something was reluctant to let go. I walked out into the parking lot. The sun was too bright. I squinted against it and got in my car. My hands were shaking. I gripped the steering wheel until they steadied. I'd seen something. Or felt something. I didn't know which. It had been real. There was something in that church. Something that responded when they called to it.

I drove back to the motel and sat on the bed, staring at the wall. Evening service was at six. I had a few hours. I wasn't going back for evening service. I'd seen enough. Now I needed to see what they didn't want visitors to see. I needed to come back at night.

I spent the afternoon at the diner. Coffee and pie I didn't touch. Linda refilled my cup. A few locals nodded at me. They'd seen me at the morning service. By the time I got back to the motel, it was almost dark. I sat in my room and waited. Watched the clock tick past six, past seven, past eight. Evening service would be over by now.

I changed into dark clothes. Jeans, black t-shirt, hoodie. Put my phone in my pocket, made sure it was on silent. The drive to the church took ten minutes. I killed my headlights a quarter mile out and coasted the rest of the way, parking on the shoulder behind a stand of trees. The church sat dark against the night sky. No cars in the parking lot. No lights in the windows. I watched for five minutes. Nothing moved.

I got out and walked across the parking lot, staying low. The front door was locked. I circled around the building. The back had a small window, the kind that tilted out for ventilation. It was latched, but the latch looked old. I found a rock in the gravel and used it to tap at the frame until the wood splintered enough for me to work the latch free. The window swung open. I pulled myself up and through, landing hard on the floor inside.

I was in a storage room. Shelves lined the walls, stacked with hymnals and boxes of candles. A door on the far side led into the main sanctuary. I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. The sanctuary looked different at night. The cross on the wall behind the pulpit seemed larger somehow. I walked down the center aisle.

The door behind the pulpit. That's where the man in the mask had come from. I walked up the steps to the platform and tried the handle. Unlocked. A narrow and dim hallway lay beyond. My phone's flashlight only reached so far. I could see another door at the far end, but nothing else. I walked forward. The hallway smelled like damp earth. The door at the end opened to a stairwell. Concrete steps leading down into darkness. The smell was stronger here. I covered my nose with my sleeve and started down.

The stairs went deeper than they should have. One flight, then another, then another. The temperature dropped. The walls changed from concrete to rough stone. Water seeped through the cracks, making everything slick. At the bottom, a tunnel. Carved through rock, shored up in places with old timber beams. Electric lights hung from the ceiling every twenty feet or so, bare bulbs that cast weak yellow light. Someone had been down here recently. The lights were on.

The tunnel opened into a chamber. It was large, maybe the size of a gymnasium. The ceiling was high, disappearing into shadow. The floor sloped down toward the center, where there was a pit. Around the pit, symbols had been carved into the stone. Geometric patterns I couldn't quite understand. My eyes kept sliding off them.

And at the edge of the pit, there were people. I ducked behind an outcropping of rock. Counted maybe a dozen figures in dark robes, standing in a circle at the edge of the pit. They were chanting, the same low hum I'd heard during the service. It resonated through the chamber, through my bones. In the center of the circle, the man in the white suit and pale mask. Kneeling in front of him, hands bound, was a girl in white shorts and a tee shirt. She was blindfolded. She was crying, trying to pull away from the hands holding her. The people in robes didn't let go.

The man in the mask raised his arms. The chanting grew louder. Something in the pit answered. It rose slowly. Pale shapes in the darkness, glistening wet. My eyes tried to follow the edges of it, find where one part ended and another began. The edges kept moving. Reorganizing. A surface that might have been skin split open and folded back on itself. Something that looked like a milky and unfocused eye rolled to the surface before sinking back down into the mass. A cluster of what might have been tentacles emerged from a different section, flexing and curling before they were absorbed back into the whole.

It was massive. What I could see peeking over the edge was just a fraction of it. The rest extended down into the pit, into depths I couldn't comprehend. Pain spiked behind my eyes. I pressed my palms against my temples. The pressure didn't help. My vision blurred at the edges. I blinked hard. The thing was still there, still rising. My teeth ached. My jaw was clenched so tight I thought something might crack. I tried to relax it, but couldn't. A high-pitched ringing started in my ears. Under it, a sound like static. Or wet things moving against each other.

I started shaking. I felt like I was outside my body looking in. They pulled the blindfold off. The girl saw the abomination and began screaming, snapping me back to awareness.

The robed figures lifted her and carried her to the edge of the pit. She fought, but there were too many of them. They held her over the edge, suspended above the thing below, then threw her down. The thing began to descend back into the pit, taking the girl with it. Her screams faded as it pulled her down into the darkness. Down and down and down, until I couldn't hear her scream anymore.

The robed figures lowered their heads. The man in the mask stepped back from the edge. Every head turned toward me. I must have made a sound. Or maybe they'd known I was there the whole time. The robed figures moved calmly and deliberately toward me.

I staggered backward, away from the outcropping. My legs felt like they weren't working right. I tried to run, my body wasn't responding. I made it a few steps before my legs gave out. Hands grabbed me. Pulled me upright. I didn't fight. What was the point?

They dragged me back toward the pit. I thought they were going to throw me in. Feed me to that thing like they'd fed the girl.

They didn't. They pulled me past the pit, toward another tunnel I hadn't noticed. Deeper into the earth. The man in the mask walked beside me. He didn't say anything. Just watched as they carried me away.

The last thing I remember before the darkness took me was a white rag, reeking faintly of something chemical, covering my mouth. Then nothing.

Whatever they had used to drug me was wearing off, but my mind still felt thick. My awareness slowly floated up out of the pit of black velvet it had been stewing in. I was hanging by my arms from overhead. I looked up. Thick chains bound my wrists and dug into my skin. A gag filled my mouth that tasted faintly of rubber. I tried to swallow but couldn't. A single naked light bulb hung above me, casting deep shadows around the rest of the room.

I had completely fucked up. I knew what rooms like this were used for. I knew what was coming. The metal door creaked open, and the man with the pale mask and the crisp white suit from the ceremony walked in. He cocked his head to the side and smiled a joyless smile.

""I'm going to break you, Boy. And there's nothing you can do about it.""

It almost sounded ridiculous in his deep southern accent, like I was being threatened by Colonel Sanders. But there was absolutely nothing funny about the quiet malice in his voice. He circled around me, dragging something long and thin that I couldn't quite make out across the bare floor. The anticipation made my guts feel cold and twisted.

I heard the first strike whip though the air before it landed. Across my shoulders, a line of burning pain. I jerked and twisted against the chains as my back exploded into fire. A cane. A bamboo cane. Shit.

""You came here thinking you'd be the one, Didn't you?"" He kept circling. ""The one to expose us. The one to save everyone.""

His voice seemed to jump around. Sometimes close to my ear. Sometimes behind me. Another strike, lower this time. I strained against the chains biting into my flesh.

""You're what, twenty-one? Twenty-two? You've been alive long enough that you think you understand how the world works. You have no fucking clue.""

Three vicious strikes, one right after the other. My screams were muffled by the thick gag. I tried to focus, I couldn't. Between the pain and the drugs, my mind felt soft.

""You were careful, I'll give you that. Thought you'd covered your tracks."" His voice stayed level, almost bored. ""You thought you were smarter than the people who've been doing this for thirty fucking years.""

He stopped, and I heard him take a deep breath.

""The arrogance of youth, you can't help it."" The end of the cane tapped against my skull. Once. Twice. ""You still think you're special.""

""Nobody's coming for you, and nobody knows where you are."" He was in front of me now, crouching down. Through the pain and the tears, the mask was just a blur of white. ""And in a week, nobody will remember they should be looking.""

He stood. Started circling again.

""You'll understand eventually. If there's enough of you left to understand anything.""

Time stopped meaning much after a while. They took my clothes and gave me an over sized pair of joggers and a tee shirt to wear. They'd move me from the room with the chains to a cell. Brick walls, no windows, a metal door with a slot for food. Then back to the room with the chains. The cult leader would come. The cane would come out. I'd scream until my voice gave out, then scream some more. Sometimes it was the cult leader. Sometimes it was others. Men in robes, who didn't speak, just did what they were told. They gave me water and enough food to keep me alive.

I lost track of how many times they dragged me back to that room. The days bled together, but I'm sure it had been almost a week. Then one night, or maybe it was day, I heard footsteps moving past my cell. I went still. The lock clicked quietly. The door eased open an inch. I caught a flash of a light blue eye and part of a face that looked familiar. The footsteps kept going. They faded down the corridor.

I stared at it a while. This had to be a trick. A test. They were watching to see if I'd try to run so they could punish me worse. I was already broken. What more could they do?

I pulled myself to my feet using the wall. Every movement sent fire through my back. I stepped into the hallway. The tunnel branched. I took the path that sloped upward. Figured up was good. Up meant surface. Up meant out.

I heard two voices ahead. One of them was the cult leader. I'd know that smooth southern drawl anywhere. The other voice was unfamiliar. Pleading. I followed the sound.

The tunnel opened into the chamber with the pit. The same place I'd watched them feed the girl to that thing. The same place they'd dragged me past after they caught me.

Only two people this time. Just the man in the white suit standing at the edge of the pit, and another man on his knees in front of him. The kneeling man was older, maybe fifty, with my father's eyes, my father's face. I knew without being told. This was the person who'd sent me the list. This was family.

The cult leader had a gun. He was talking, his voice calm and measured, explaining something to the man on the ground. I couldn't make out the words. Then he raised the gun and fired. The sound echoed through the chamber. My distant relative fell forward, clutching his stomach.

I ran at him. My legs barely worked. I stumbled once, caught myself, kept going. The cult leader heard me at the last second, started to turn. I tackled him with all the strength I could manage. My shoulder drove into his ribs. He went over the edge.

For a split second, I thought I was going down with him. My momentum carried me forward, my feet skidding on the wet ground. Then I caught my balance before I went over too. He fell. The pale mask came loose and fluttered away from his face. Just an old man. White hair, deep wrinkles, eyes wide with terror. His white suit bright against the darkness below. He didn't scream. Or if he did, I couldn't hear it over the sound of something moving in the deep. Something rising to meet him.

I staggered over to the man laying on the ground. He looked so much like my father it hurt. He was still breathing. Shallow, wet sounds. Blood spread across his shirt.

""Go,"" he whispered. His eyes found mine. Same shape as my father's, but lighter. ""Go now.""

""I can't leave you.""

""You have to."" He coughed. More blood at the corner of his mouth. ""Tell people. Tell them what happens here.""

From the pit, sounds. Screams and wet, ripping noises. Then nothing. He fumbled at his pocket. He pulled out keys, pressed them into my palm. ""My car. Blue Ford. Parking lot. Clothes, wallet, phone. Everything you came here with is in the trunk.""

""Come with me.""

""Can't."" His breathing was getting worse. ""I'm sorry. About your dad. About all of it. I should have…"" Another cough. ""Should have done this years ago.""

""What's your name?""

He smiled. Blood on his teeth. ""Daniel.""

""I'm Charlie.""

""I know."" His eyes started to close. ""Run, Charlie.""

I wanted to stay. Wanted to tell him it was okay, that he'd done enough, that he'd saved me. Footsteps echoed from the tunnel. Someone was coming.

I ran.

Back through the tunnels. Up the stairs. I burst through the door behind the pulpit, into the church sanctuary. Early morning light came through the windows. The front door was locked from the inside. I flipped the bolt and ran outside. The parking lot was empty except for a few cars. A blue Ford. Twenty years old, rusted around the edges. I got my stuff out of the trunk, and started driving.

I didn't know where I was going at first. Just away. After an hour, I realized I was heading north. Toward home. Toward my mother. I needed to warn her. I had to tell her everything. More importantly, I had to make sure she was safe.

I drove for hours. Stopped once at a gas station, used the bathroom to wash the worst of the blood off. The clerk stared at me but didn't say anything. Once I was back on the road, I tried to call my mother three times. No answer. She was fine. She had to be fine.

I crossed the state line as the sun was setting. Two more hours to home.

My phone rang. Unknown number. I almost didn't answer.

""Hello?""

""Is this Charlie?"" A man's voice. Official-sounding.

My stomach dropped. ""Yes.""

""This is Detective Garrett with the county sheriff's department. I'm calling about your mother, Sandra. There's been an incident at her residence. We need you to come to…""

""What happened?""

""Sir, I think it's better if we discuss this in person. Are you in the area?""

""What happened to my mother?""

Silence on the other end. Then: ""There was a fire. I'm very sorry.""

The rest of the conversation was white noise. I don't remember what he said or what I said back. I remember pulling over to the side of the highway. Sitting there with my hands on the wheel. Staring at nothing.

Then I was driving again.

I pulled onto my mother's street just after nine. The house was dark. The roof was gone. The walls were blackened shells. Yellow crime scene tape stretched across the front yard. A single patrol car sat at the curb. No fire trucks. No ambulances. They'd already taken her away. I parked and got out. Walked toward the house like I was in a dream. The patrol officer got out of his car when he saw me approaching the tape.

""Sir, this is an active investigation.""

""That's my house,"" I said. ""My mother.""

""Hold on."" He pulled out his phone, made a call. Spoke quietly for a minute, then hung up. ""Detective Garrett is on his way. Should be about twenty minutes. You want to wait in your car?""

I shook my head.

The officer went back to his car but kept watching me. I sat down on the curb across the street. The smell of burned wood hung in the air. Wet ash. Chemicals from whatever the firefighters had used. A neighbor's porch light came on. Mrs. Patterson from two doors down. She came out in her bathrobe, saw me, and started crying before she even made it across her yard. She sat next to me on the curb. Said she'd seen my mother just yesterday morning, they'd talked about the garden. She'd seemed fine. Happy, even. Then last night, around seven, she'd smelled smoke. Called 911. By the time the trucks got there, the whole house was engulfed.

Detective Garrett arrived fifteen minutes later. Got out of an unmarked sedan, walked over to where I was sitting. Structure fire. Arson investigator. My mother's body. I'm so sorry for your loss.

I asked when it happened. He checked his notes. Yesterday evening. They'd already won. Before I even pushed their leader into the pit, they'd already taken what mattered.

I stood there and stared at the ruins of the house where I'd grown up. Nothing was left. The detective asked if I knew of anyone who would want to hurt my mother. Any threats, any unusual contact in recent weeks.

What could I say? That a cult in the middle of nowhere fed people to a monster underground, and they killed my mother to tie up loose ends? He'd think I was crazy. Or in shock. Or both.

So I said no. Said I couldn't think of anyone. Said my mother was a good person who didn't have enemies. He gave me his card. Told me to call if I remembered anything. Said they'd be in touch.

I sat on the curb until the police left too. Until it was just me and the burned house. My father had run from that church to protect his family. He'd spent thirty years keeping his distance, never looking back, never mentioning it. I'd undone all of it in a few weeks because I found a letter and thought I deserved answers, and my mother had paid the price.",2,1768188219.0,u_somethinggoeshere2,0,1.0,False

I just don't know what to eat. I know I'm supposed to eat a lot of protein, avoid Vitamin C and coffee and whatever else within an hour or whatever of taking my meds. But what the hell am I supposed to eat throughout the day?

  
I typically take my meds around 7am. I have an aversion to eating breakfast too early in the morning since it makes me queasy/nauseous. Before my meds, I would make a high protien oatmeal pack and bring it to work with me so I could eat around 9/9:30, then eat around 1:30 for lunch, and eat dinner when I got home somewhere between 6/7pm. This was fine.

  
Now that I'm medicated again I cannot figure out what to eat. Eating a full high protein breakfast at 7am is not feasible for me, but if I don't eat anything I'm a jittery mess and my meds don't last a full day or  it's almost like I burn through them too fast. I did start doing some protein shakes first thing in the morning which seems to help, but it's not a good replacement for actually eating. If I eat too many carby things I just feel crappy overall, which never used to be the case. My normal lunch of leftovers from dinner the night before isn't cutting it either. I'm snacking on beef sticks throughout the day just to up the amount of protein I'm taking in, but then I'm not eating enough fiber. (And I don't really love the idea of eating beef sticks all the time). 

  
Should I be doing yogurt, granola, and fruit in the morning? Should I be doing salads with some kind of protein for lunch? I'm honestly not even sure where to start. This whole thing has been a little overwhelming and I'm still playing the medication lotto for dosing so who knows what I'll look like in another two weeks even. 

  
Any help or suggestions are absolutely appreciated. I plan to ask my doctor in two days for any recommendations, but I'd love some tips or tricks along the way.",1,1768188071.0,adhdwomen,7,1.0,False

1qajthc,https://i.redd.it/ja6niobz5ucg1.jpeg,"Whoops Babe! Your 'Dream Life'? Built with MY Money, MY Man, MY House!","Scrolling through my phone on the way back from my OB appointment, I clicked on a link in our local moms' group without thinking.


The post? ""CEO husband + perfect baby boy = my blessed life! Beverly Hills living! #SpoiledWife""


I was about to roll my eyes and keep scrolling when—


My finger froze.


The photo punched me right in the gut.


Some young, drop-dead gorgeous woman held a toddler, both grinning like they owned the world. Behind them? That stupidly tender look…


My husband.


The location tag showed MY grandmother's estate. The one she had left to ME.


My heart was pounding now, but here was where it got really good:


I knew exactly who this bitch was.


Remember that ""poor struggling college student"" I had sponsored through four years of university? The one who had sent me that weepy thank-you letter about ""working hard to give back to society"" and ""never forgetting my kindness""?


Yeah. Her.


Guess she had found her own way to ""give back.""


I pressed my hand against my six-month baby bump.


My smile was ice-cold.


Oh, sweetheart. You had no idea what was coming for you.


My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold my phone.


I kept zooming in on that photo. On his wrist—the watch I gave him for his thirty-ninth birthday.


The way he was looking at them. At her and that kid.


Like they were his whole damn world.


I hadn't seen that look in two years.


The comments section was pure chaos.


""STOPPP your husband is gorgeous wtf""


""This is what dreams are made of omg""


""Beverly Hills mansion + hot CEO husband + perfect baby = you're living my fantasy life""


And Little Miss Homewrecker was eating it up, replying to everyone:


""He's just really good to me ♥ I'm so lucky""


He's just really good to me.


I wanted to throw my phone through the windshield.


My stomach lurched. Hard.


I shoved the car door open and barely made it to the curb before I was puking my guts out.


""Jesus—Mrs. Blackwood! You okay? Should I take you to the ER?"" Charles, our driver, scrambled out with a water bottle.


I waved him off, rinsed my mouth, and got back in the car.


Every part of me felt like ice.


Our house sat behind the gates of Ridgemont Estates—old money, new money, the kind of neighborhood where everyone minded their business because they all had secrets.


Margaret, our housekeeper, met me at the door. ""Oh honey, you look like death. What did Dr. Morrison say?""


I looked at her. Really looked at her.


""Margaret... has Grayson actually been at the office these past few weeks?""


Her face gave her away before she even opened her mouth.


""That's... that's what he told me to say, Mrs. Blackwood.""


Right.


In this giant house, I was the only idiot still buying his bullshit.


I walked upstairs like a zombie.


Our bedroom was pristine. Magazine-perfect. Cold as a morgue.


Nothing about it said home. Nothing said he actually lived here anymore.


I opened his closet. Rows of suits lined up like soldiers. Everything in its place.


I pulled open the top drawer of his dresser.


A blue velvet box.


Next Wednesday was our ninth anniversary.


Was this supposed to be for me?


Nine years.


We'd started with nothing. A shitty apartment and ramen dinners and dreams bigger than our bank account. I watched him build his company from the ground up, deal by deal, all-nighter by all-nighter.


Six years ago, when everything almost fell apart—when his competitors came for him and things got ugly—I was the one who stepped in front of that knife.


That knife took our first baby.


It took any chance of me having another.


The doctors said my uterus was too scarred. Getting pregnant again was basically impossible.


Which made this baby—this absolute miracle inside me right now—the best anniversary gift I could've ever given him.


I took a breath and opened the box.


A massive diamond ring stared back at me. Blinding. Beautiful.


Empty.


My phone lit up.


Grayson calling.


Chapter 2


I stared at his name on my screen.


Grayson.


My chest felt like someone had reached in and was squeezing my heart with their bare hands.


I let it ring three more times before I answered.


""Hey.""


""Liv."" His voice was smooth as always. Tired, though. Distracted. ""Listen, I've got this international call tonight. Gonna be late. Don't wait up, okay?""


Another call. Another late night.


There was a time when he'd call me before bed no matter what. When he'd talk to me until I fell asleep.


Now? I got a courtesy heads-up like I was his assistant.


I gripped that cold diamond ring until my nails dug into my palm.


""Gray... do you remember what next Wednesday is?""


Silence.


Then I heard it—a woman's voice in the background, sweet and syrupy:


""Gray, who are you talking to? Come help me, Theo can't get his Legos to work...""


He covered the phone, but I could still hear him: ""I'm handling something. Take Theo and get him ready for bed.""


When he came back on, his voice had an edge.


""It's just an anniversary, Liv. Does it really matter that much? Work's insane right now. I'll have my assistant book us somewhere nice and send you something. Sound good?""


My voice came out shaking.


""Grayson. Are you lying to me?""


He sighed. Hard.


""Jesus Christ, Olivia. I'm out here busting my ass for this family, and you're gonna start with the paranoid bullshit again? I'm exhausted. I'm hanging up.""


Click.


The line went dead.


I set my phone down slowly.


Looked at that diamond ring sitting there like a joke.


And I laughed.


Right. How could I be so ungrateful?


He gave me everything money could buy. Designer clothes, luxury cars, a house most people would kill for.


What more could I possibly want?


Except he had no idea what I actually wanted.


Nine years ago, we were splitting instant ramen in a basement apartment. He told me, ""One day I'm gonna get you out of here. Big house. Huge diamond. The whole thing.""


I'd laughed and said, ""I don't need a big house or a diamond. I just need you to keep loving me like you do right now.""


He'd pulled me close and whispered ""I love you"" over and over until I believed it was permanent.


Turns out nothing's permanent.


And that girl I'd helped out of the goodness of my stupid heart?


She'd found her own way to say thanks.


I barely slept that night.


When I did, I dreamed of knives and blood and babies I'd never hold.


Two days crawled by.


On the third morning, I woke up early.


Sat at the breakfast table with my phone.


She'd posted again.


A selfie this time—full makeup, glowing skin, and on her hand?


That ring. The one from the blue velvet box.


The caption read: ""Thank you babe for the early bday gift ♥ Love you so much! Next Wednesday can't come fast enough!""


Next Wednesday.


Her birthday.


More important than our nine-year anniversary, apparently.


That ring was never meant for me.


I stared out the window at the bright morning sun.


I'd never felt colder in my life.


I grabbed my coat.


""Charles. We're going to Beverly Hills.""


Chapter 3


A young nanny opened the door.


She stared at me for a second, then her face went guarded.


""Can I help you?""


I stepped past her into the entryway.


Two pairs of slippers sat neatly by the door. Men's. Women's.


In the living room, a toddler—maybe two years old—was playing on a foam mat, babbling ""Dada, dada"" over and over.


Every word felt like a needle straight through my chest.


I couldn't breathe.


""I'm here to see Grayson Blackwood.""


Footsteps on the stairs.


She came down wearing a silk robe, all soft and sleepy-looking. When she saw me, panic flashed across her face for half a second before she rearranged it into something pitiful.


""Oh my god... Mrs. Blackwood?""


I looked around slowly.


Family photos on the walls. The three of them, smiling. Baby bottles and toys scattered on the coffee table.


This place looked like an actual home.


More than mine ever did.


""Natalie,"" I said, my voice ice-cold. ""I paid for four years of your college. Was this how you planned to pay me back?""


Her face went sheet-white. Her lip trembled.


""Mrs. Blackwood, I... I don't know what you're talking about...""


""No?""


I pulled out my phone and shoved the photo in her face—the one she'd posted. Her and Grayson and that kid.


""Then explain this. My husband. My grandmother's house. Where's your conscience, Natalie?""


Tears spilled down her cheeks. She dropped to her knees like someone cut her strings.


""I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry! It's all my fault! I just—I love him so much, I couldn't help myself! Please, Mrs. Blackwood, please forgive us!""


She was sobbing now, looking like some tragic heroine.


Once upon a time, maybe I would've felt bad for her.


Now? I just felt sick.


""Love?"" I laughed. It sounded ugly. ""Your love is built on someone else's pain. On betrayal. You call that love?""


I looked down at her, perfectly calm.


""Natalie. Playing house in someone else's home? That's got to have limits. This house is mine.""


Her face crumpled. Fresh tears. The full performance.


""Mrs. Blackwood, you don't understand—Gray and I are really in love. He told me... he said you two don't even have feelings for each other anymore. That he only stays because of obligation.""


""Really in love,"" I repeated slowly. ""So your 'real love' is built on wrecking someone's marriage? In my dead grandmother's house?""


""I... I didn't know it was yours."" She bit her lip, tears streaming. ""Gray said he bought it for me... Mrs. Blackwood, please, don't be mad at him. It's all my fault. If you're angry, yell at me—just don't fight with him. He works so hard already...""


What a saint.


I stared at her pathetic little act and realized something:


I didn't want to fight with her.


She wasn't worth it.


The problem was never her.


It was him.


I pulled out my phone and called Grayson right in front of her.


He picked up on the second ring.


""Liv? What's wrong?""


""Grayson."" My voice was steady. Cold. ""You've got thirty minutes to get your mistress and your kid out of my house.""


I hung up.


Natalie's face went from white to gray.


Less than two minutes later, tires screeched in the driveway.


Grayson came through that door.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Sorry this might be a little long. I’ve had issues with low blood sugar since I was a kid. Usually going too long without eating or skipping breakfast and passing out in class. About  5 years ago I developed reactive hypoglycemia and these episodes include the shaking, weakness and full blown want to rip my clothes off kind of hot (and sometimes I do!) with profuse sweating that leaves me drenched. Like night sweats but awake. I’m female, 5’9’’ 178 lbs, 48 years old. I’ve had a lap-band since 2013 and used to be morbidly obese at 371 lbs. The episodes are getting more frequent (about once a week) and it’s usually because I go a long time without eating and then have something carb dense or really sugary. But last night scared the crap out of me. I’ve been restricting calories and thought I was eating fairly healthy this week. I’ve been trying to have small meals with a lot of protein. Last night was a takeout night so I had a half of a Chick-fil-A sandwich and half of the medium fries at 7 pm. 10 pm I had protein pudding (1 g of sugar) and a built bar smore (half Built bar and 2 graham crackers. I was also sipping on coffee with regular creamer. I curled up on the couch with the hubby and dog wanting to go to bed but couldn’t make it that far. I wasn’t shaking just not feeling right but thought I was just tired. I was closing my eyes off and on when the hot feeling started. I jumped up to get the glucose monitor I had just bought and was pouring with sweat by the time I took it. It was 39. Now I’m freaking out because what if I was sleeping? And why did it even happen? I’m a bit of a control freak and feel like I have no control over this now. Also I’ve known my blood sugar was low when I had these episodes but didn’t think it would be scary low like that. I ate some candy and got it up but I’m really concerned that it could happen when I’m sleeping. And if I am sleeping will my body raise my BS on its own or do I have to eat something? I’ve also been having night sweats a lot but I figure that’s due to my age. Any advice is appreciated. I’m trying to figure it all out. I talked to my doctor a couple of months ago and she said sounds like hypoglycemia so make sure to eat something every couple of hours and get a glucose monitor. I’m keeping a food diary when it happens. I guess maybe what I thought was eating healthy isn’t really healthy? ",2,1768187703.0,Hypoglycemia,1,1.0,False

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1qajqy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivinginPhoenix/comments/1qajqy3/living_in_downtown_phoenix_guide_2026/,Living in Downtown Phoenix Guide (2026),"# Everything You Need to Know About Living in Downtown Phoenix

**Why this is not a copy-paste take**

I grew up in Phoenix and watched downtown change from an “event zone” into a real neighborhood. This post reflects that context plus practical, on-the-ground details people ask when considering a move to Arizona.

**Q: What’s it like living in Downtown Phoenix?**  
A: Living in downtown Phoenix is a walkable, entertainment-rich, and transit-connected experience, but it comes with city realities like higher property crime, visible homelessness, and limited grocery stores.

I grew up in Phoenix. Not the Instagram version, the real one. For most of my childhood and teenage years, downtown Phoenix was not a place you “hung out.” You went there for a Suns game, maybe a concert, and then you left. **If you stayed after dark, people assumed either your car broke down or you were making questionable life choices.** Slight exaggeration, but not by much!

Back then, downtown was mostly government buildings, office towers, and sports venues surrounded by surface parking lots. The idea of meeting friends for dinner downtown on a random Tuesday night would have sounded about as realistic as dial up internet making a comeback in today’s world.

Fast forward about 40 years, and especially the last 15, and downtown Phoenix has undergone one of the biggest transformations in the Valley. It’s no longer just an event zone. It’s a real neighborhood now, with residents, schools, grocery stores, culture, and daily life happening well beyond game nights.

**Here’s what living in downtown Phoenix actually looks like today.**

# How has Downtown Phoenix changed over the years?

For decades, Phoenix developed outward, not upward. Suburbs exploded and downtown stagnated. That started changing in the late 2000s and accelerated after 2010 with major public and private investment: light rail expansion, ASU’s downtown campus, sports venue upgrades, residential towers, and arts-focused redevelopment around Roosevelt Row.

The opening of ASU’s Downtown Phoenix campus in 2006 brought a permanent student and faculty population. Valley Metro Light Rail began service in 2008, connecting downtown to Midtown, Tempe, and later Mesa ([Valley Metro Rail](https://www.valleymetro.org/)).

Since roughly 2010, downtown Phoenix has shifted from a pass-through district to one of the Valley’s primary entertainment, cultural, and urban residential hubs. Since 2020 alone, downtown has added more than 5,000 apartment units, with tons more planned or under construction.

# Where Downtown Phoenix Is Located

Downtown Phoenix is generally defined as the area bordered by McDowell Road to the north, 7th street to the west, Buckeye Rd to the south, and 7th ave to the east. But as a Phoenix native, we call downtown everything within the freeway circle of the I17 to the I17 to the 10 and the 10. In this blog though, Ill be pushing a bit further north to chat about everything below Thomas. I want to give you real insight from people who have lived here forever (me!), not some generic AI output or info from people who have never even been downtown. So, within the boundaries I mentioned above are Encanto, Willow, Coronado, Roosevelt Row, the Warehouse District, Portland St, the Central Avenue corridor, the civic and government core, and ASU’s downtown campus.

# Neighborhoods for Living in Downtown Phoenix

Roosevelt Row and Evans Churchill sit on the north and northeast side of the core and are where you’ll find the highest concentration of newer mid-rise apartment buildings, bars, coffee shops, murals, galleries, and First Friday traffic. If you want to walk to art, cocktails, and restaurants, this is the “I actually live downtown” zone most people picture. (For official downtown updates and initiatives: [Downtown Phoenix Inc.](https://dtphx.org/))

The Warehouse District is south of Washington and Jefferson near the ballpark. It’s where you’ll see more converted industrial character, newer high-rise clusters, and heavy event energy on game nights. It feels more sports and concerts than tree-lined neighborhood.

Portland Street is a real micro area people mention now because so much housing and retail has stacked up right around it. Broadstone Portland is one of the main examples. The vibe is apartment-forward with quick access to Roosevelt Row, Hance Park, and the light rail.

**Encanto sits north of the downtown core** and is where Phoenix starts to shift from true urban density into classic Central Phoenix. Encanto Park and Encanto Golf Course anchor the area and give it a very different feel from the warehouse districts and high-rise clusters downtown. More grass. More mature trees. More “old Phoenix.”

**Encanto Village** is not a single neighborhood. It is a large, official City of Phoenix Urban Village — a planning district used for zoning, transportation, and long-term growth. Encanto Village covers a wide area that includes parts of Midtown, major corridors along Central Avenue, institutional uses, parks, museums, light rail stops, medical offices, apartments, and multiple residential pockets. When the city says “Encanto,” this is usually what they mean.

**Encanto historic neighborhoods** are specific residential pockets within or near that larger village. Encanto-Palmcroft is the best-known (wide, palm-lined streets and early-20th-century architecture like Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial, and Mediterranean). Encanto Vista and Encanto Manor are smaller, primarily post-war areas with Ranch and mid-century homes and close proximity to the golf course and park. In short: Encanto Village is the big planning area; the historic neighborhoods are the character-driven residential sections inside it.

**Willo Historic District sits just just northwest of the downtown core**. It’s early-1900s through mid-century homes, historic overlays, and big pride-of-ownership energy. People who want character and a yard but still want to be minutes from downtown often end up looking here.

**Coronado is east of Central and north of the I-10 corridor,** full of historic bungalows, block construction, and remodels. It’s one of the most popular “I want central Phoenix, not suburban Phoenix” neighborhoods because it’s close to downtown without being in the middle of downtown.

**Garfield is closer to the downtown edge and still changing fast**. It has older homes, new builds, and infill. It’s one of the neighborhoods where you feel the transition in real time, street by street.

# Housing Options in Downtown Phoenix

# Apartments

**Downtown is primarily an apartment market.**

As of late 2025:

* Average rent: approximately $2,000 per month
* Studios: approximately $1,450
* One-bedroom: approximately $1,850 to $1,950
* Two-bedroom: $2,500 and up
* Sources include RentCafe, Zumper, and on-site property listings.

Examples of current downtown properties include Altura on Pierce, Camden Copper Square, Brix Warehouse District, Union at Roosevelt, X Phoenix, Aspire Fillmore, and Broadstone Portland. Newer high-rise developments are concentrated near Central Avenue, Roosevelt Street, and the Warehouse District.

More current pricing examples that people actually ask about, because these names come up constantly:

* Altura on Pierce tends to show wide rent ranges by unit type and floor, with studios and one beds commonly listed in the mid $1,000s and premium units higher.
* Broadstone Portland is often marketed as a Roosevelt Row and Hance Park adjacent building and regularly lists one and two bedroom pricing across the mid $1,000s into the $2,000s depending on unit size and timing.
* X Phoenix is one of the higher-profile high-rise style communities downtown and tends to price above older mid-rise stock, especially on larger units and higher floors.
* Union at Roosevelt is right in the center of Roosevelt Row foot traffic and typically sits in the newer-build pricing tier.

Prices fluctuate monthly and do not include taxes, parking, or amenity fees.

# Condos and Townhomes

Limited but available. Most are concentrated near Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the Warehouse District.

Prices typically range from the mid-$300,000s to $700,000 and higher depending on the building, views, parking, and HOA structure.

Inventory is far smaller than apartments, which keeps pricing relatively firm.

If you want condo and townhome living instead of a lease, you usually end up shopping in a few predictable places:

* Mid-rise condo style buildings near Roosevelt Row and the arts district core.
* Central Avenue corridor buildings where you trade a monthly HOA for views, security, and walkability.
* Townhome pockets on the downtown edge, especially as you move into Coronado and parts of Encanto and Willo where the built form shifts from towers to smaller attached housing.

# Single-Family Homes

Rare within the downtown core, but available in adjacent historic neighborhoods such as Roosevelt Historic District, Willo, Encanto, and Garfield.

These areas offer early-20th-century homes, tree-lined streets, and historic preservation overlays. Prices often range from $600,000 to well over $1 million depending on condition, lot size, and historic designation.

Willo tends to skew higher because the historic district brand is strong, the streets feel established, and the home styles are the kind people move here for: pre-war and mid-century homes, brick and stucco, bigger lots, mature landscaping, and a real neighborhood grid you can walk.

Encanto can jump fast because of the park and golf course proximity and the feel of the area.

Coronado is often slightly more accessible than Willo but still not “cheap,” and it has a huge number of 1930s to 1950s bungalows and block homes that remodel well.

Garfield is where you can still see more price spread because it’s actively changing, and the mix of original homes, flips, and new infill varies block by block.

# Crime and Safety (The Real Version)

Downtown Phoenix has higher reported crime rates than suburban Phoenix, particularly for property crime. This is typical of dense, urban cores. ([Phoenix Police Crime Statistics](https://www.phoenix.gov/police/resources-information/crime-stats-and-maps))

Violent crime exists but is concentrated in specific pockets and tends to be situational rather than random. Most residents report that daily life feels safe when using basic city awareness.

The homelessness crisis is visible downtown. “The Zone,” a large encampment, was cleared in 2023, but homelessness remains an ongoing citywide issue rather than one isolated to downtown. (City resources: [City of Phoenix Downtown Development](https://www.phoenix.gov/communitydevelopment))

Sources include Phoenix Police Department crime statistics, the Maricopa Association of Governments, and the City of Phoenix Human Services Department.

# Walkability and Transportation

**Downtown Phoenix is one of the most walkable areas in the Valley.**

* Light Rail costs $2 per ride and connects downtown to Midtown, Uptown, Tempe, and Mesa.
* Walk Scores typically range from 70 to 90 depending on location.
* Bike infrastructure has expanded significantly around Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the downtown core.
* Driving times during off-peak hours are approximately ten minutes to Sky Harbor Airport, five to ten minutes to Midtown Phoenix, fifteen minutes to Tempe, and twenty to twenty-five minutes to Scottsdale.

Traffic is light by big-city standards but heavier during games, concerts, and festivals.

# Entertainment, Sports and Nightlife

Living downtown puts you near the Suns, Mercury, and Diamondbacks. The Suns and Mercury play downtown at the arena that was formerly Footprint Center. The Diamondbacks play at Chase Field. These venues anchor downtown and are a major reason the area stayed relevant even before people lived there. (Arena naming coverage: [AZFamily](https://www.azfamily.com/))

Major concert and performance venues include Arizona Financial Theatre, The Van Buren, Crescent Ballroom, Orpheum Theatre, and Symphony Hall. It is realistic to walk to NBA games, WNBA games, MLB games, concerts, comedy shows, and festivals. That was not a thing when I was growing up.

**Big recurring events that actually change traffic, parking, and the feel of downtown:**

* First Friday on Roosevelt Row.
* Diamondbacks home stands and big weekend series.
* Major touring shows at The Van Buren and Arizona Financial Theatre.
* Large conventions and expo weekends tied to the Phoenix Convention Center.
* Holiday events and seasonal markets that concentrate around CityScape, Heritage Square, and the Roosevelt corridor.

# Restaurants, Bars and Coffee

**Downtown Phoenix is now one of the strongest food districts in the Valley.**

Standout restaurants include Pizzeria Bianco, Bacanora, Wren and Wolf, Flour and Thyme, Sottise, and Cornish Pasty Co., which has been a downtown staple long before the area’s resurgence became obvious.

Bars include Bitter and Twisted, Little Rituals, The Theodore, Valley Bar, and the downtown AZ Wilderness taproom. Several have received national recognition for cocktail programs.

Local coffee shops and daytime spots include Lola Coffee, Songbird Coffee and Tea House, Futuro, Xanadu Coffee, Press Coffee, and Fair Trade Cafe, which also doubles as a local art space.

Yoga and wellness exists downtown in a way it simply did not when I was younger. A lot of residents treat Hance Park and the Roosevelt corridor like their daily routine zone: coffee, walk, class, work, repeat.

# Arts, Culture and History

Roosevelt Row remains Phoenix’s primary arts district, filled with murals, galleries, studios, and boutiques. First Friday, held monthly, is one of the largest recurring art walks in the country and draws tens of thousands of people.

Downtown is home to major cultural institutions including the Phoenix Art Museum, the largest art museum in the Southwest with over 20,000 works, and the Heard Museum, founded in 1929 and internationally respected for Native American art and history. ([Phoenix Art Museum](https://phxart.org/) • [Heard Museum](https://heard.org/))

Burton Barr Central Library is a five-story, 280,000-square-foot civic anchor featuring an interior water feature, gallery space, and public study areas.

The Arizona Science Center is downtown and is one of the most underrated “normal life” amenities for people with kids or visiting family. It’s also right next to Heritage Square, which is one of the few places downtown where you can still feel older Phoenix architecture without trying too hard. ([Arizona Science Center](https://www.azscience.org/))

The Children’s Museum of Phoenix is also downtown and is one of those places locals actually use on weekends when you have toddlers and you need to burn energy without melting outside. ([Children’s Museum of Phoenix](https://childrensmuseumofphoenix.org/))

St. Mary’s Basilica is downtown and it’s one of the clearest reminders that Phoenix is not just new build subdivisions and strip malls. It’s one of the most photographed churches in the city for a reason. ([St. Mary’s Basilica](https://stmarysbasilica.org/))

# Historic Hotels and Buildings

Hotel San Carlos still operates and hosted Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. Westward Ho was once Phoenix’s tallest building and housed numerous Hollywood figures. The Luhrs Tower, built in 1929, remains one of the city’s best examples of Art Deco architecture. The Orpheum Theatre, also opened in 1929, continues to host performances under its original ornate ceiling.

Hotel San Carlos is also one of the most talked-about “haunted” locations downtown. The haunting stories are local legend and part of the building’s pop culture identity.

More historic places people forget to mention when they copy and paste the same four buildings:

* Heritage Square and the Rosson House area, which is one of the best preserved pieces of old Phoenix in the downtown footprint.
* Union Station and the old rail influence, which matters because transportation shaped early Phoenix growth patterns long before light rail was a thing.

Downtown Phoenix has one of the highest concentrations of preserved historic architecture in the Valley.

# Schools, Demographics and Daily Life

ASU’s downtown campus houses programs in journalism, public service, nursing, law, and health sciences. Public K-12 schools within the core are limited, with more options in adjacent neighborhoods. Charter and private schools are available nearby.

Downtown residents skew toward professionals, students, creatives, and empty nesters, though the demographic mix continues to broaden as more housing comes online.

Encanto and Willo pull a different demographic than the apartment core. More long-term owners, more established households, more people who want a yard and a historic home but still want to be close to downtown. Coronado splits the difference with a mix of owners, renters, remodel buyers, and people who want central Phoenix but do not want a tower.

# Grocery Stores and Practical Realities

Grocery access remains a weak spot. Fry’s Food and Drug opened downtown in 2019, becoming the first new downtown grocery store in over fifty years. A Safeway on McDowell Road serves nearby neighborhoods but is not walkable for most residents. Smaller markets and specialty shops exist, but downtown is not grocery-dense.

The real downtown grocery reality is still this: most people either plan their trips or they supplement with delivery, smaller markets, and convenience shopping.

# Middle Housing and What It Could Change

Arizona passed a middle housing law that pushes cities toward allowing smaller multifamily housing types in more places. What that means in normal person language is more legal pathways for duplexes, triplexes, fourplex style housing, and similar “in-between” housing in areas that were historically locked into single-family zoning. ([Arizona State Legislature HB2721 summary](https://www.azleg.gov/))

How it could affect areas around downtown within the parameters of the law:

* Coronado, Garfield, and parts of the downtown edge are the most likely to see more small-scale infill and redevelopments that are not full high-rises.
* It can increase housing supply gradually without requiring a tower.
* It can also increase teardown pressure in some pockets if land values support redevelopment.
* It will not instantly change Willo and Encanto the way people on the internet pretend it will, because historic overlays, lot patterns, and neighborhood politics still matter in real life.

# Is Downtown Phoenix Worth Living In?

**Downtown Phoenix today is walkable, cultural, entertainment-rich, and transit-connected. It is still evolving.**

**It is not suburban, quiet, grocery-heavy, or free of urban issues.**

If you want a true urban lifestyle in Arizona, downtown Phoenix is the closest thing the Valley offers. And as someone who watched it go from a place you avoided after dark to a place you walk to dinner and a concert, the change is real.

If you’re deciding between downtown and other Phoenix neighborhoods, experience matters. That’s where I come in. Reach out to schedule a meeting and I’ll be sure you find your perfect home AND your perfect neighborhood.

# FAQ

**Is downtown Phoenix walkable?**

Yes. It’s one of the most walkable areas in the Valley, especially around Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the downtown core.

**What’s the biggest downside of living in downtown Phoenix?**

Urban tradeoffs: higher property crime than suburbs, visible homelessness, and grocery access that’s still thinner than most people expect.

**Are there single-family homes downtown?**

They’re rare in the core, but you’ll find more options in adjacent historic neighborhoods like Willo, Encanto, Coronado, and Garfield.

**How close is Sky Harbor from downtown?**

About ten minutes during off-peak hours (driving), which is one reason downtown works well for frequent travelers.

**Which downtown areas feel most “neighborhood” vs “event zone”?**

Roosevelt Row/Evans Churchill read as the most “I live here” walkable zone; the Warehouse District skews more event-heavy on game and concert nights.

1qajphe,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qajphe/late_night_bus_ride_to_the_coast/,Late night bus ride to the coast,"(Always looking for constructive criticism) 

During the 80’s I was a bus driver in the Pacific Northwest and I would drive a route that went from Portland all the way to the coast. I did this for about a year and while the job was great for me and my lifestyle, I wasn’t able to continue for very long after an interaction I had during the fall of 1984 with a passenger who introduced himself as Randy. My typical route started in Portland at the grand central station and would take OR 6 all the way out to Tillamook and then a short trip on some less known roads to the ocean. I had stops all along the way but 99% of the time I would only be dropping people off, never picking up. One day in late fall of 1984, I was on a friday night run out to the coast.

 If you've ever driven to the coast, you know that once you get away from Portland it's basically just farmland and dense rainforest until the ocean pops up. This particular night was very foggy, the kind of fog that dances around your bus as you drive through it. Visibility was poor, so I was driving a bit slower than I usually do. The sky was a deep dark glacial blue and the tall pines on both sides of me casted a really dark shadow on the road.

	Now I don’t typically have any stops out in an area like this because it’s so far from any major hubs that it just wouldn’t make sense. With everything being so dark, I can see up ahead the red amber glow of some taillights on the freeway, blinking. Someone was up ahead seemingly broken down and their hazards were on. I thought to myself, who the hell would be out here at this time of night? As I approached, I didn’t see anyone near or around the car. I slowed way down and instinctively threw on my hazards just to be cautious, but with the darkness I honestly wouldn’t have seen someone if they were by the truck unless they were waving a light. 

Out of nowhere just as I pass the truck I see a figure standing up from a crouched position waving their arms like a crazy person. I slow down to a stop thinking this person might be injured or having an emergency. The doors hiss as they open, and the lights in my bus wash over this man, he's about 6 feet tall, pretty good looking, a bit dirty and out of breath. He stares at me almost shocked for a minute and I ask him “need any help?”. He doesn’t say anything for a few moments but he’s looking directly at me. Something in the look on his face made my skin crawl, and I started to have doubts about my decision to stop. Finally he responds with “yeah I uhhh i’m having some issues with my truck, any chance you’re headed to Portland?” I told him that I was actually headed towards the coast and before I could finish, he cut me off and said “that’s okay too” with a warm smile. Looking back on that now, that should have been the first indicator that there was something more happening than just a simple truck breaking down.

 I motioned for him to come onto the bus, and as he steps up he asks me “how’s the route been for you tonight?” I replied and told him it’s been as easy as could be, and I made a move with my arm suggesting he take notice of the fact that no one else was on the bus. A very awkward and uncomfortable 15, maybe 20 seconds went by where he just kept looking around the bus almost like he was looking for someone or something. It was at this time that I noticed he had a particularly unpleasant smell about him. He looked a bit dirty, but he smelled like he had been out there for a while, a lot longer than a day or two. He didn’t say anything else and he went to the furthest seat in the very back corner of the bus to take a seat. 

 I continued on driving, a bit uneasy but mostly confused as to why this guy was out here and why he was crouched off to the side of the road in complete darkness. I relaxed my hands a bit on the wheel, taking note that they were gripping hard enough to cut off circulation to my fingers. There is no particular reason to suspect this guy of bad intentions yet, but my entire system is going off. I take another brief glance away from the road, up into the mirror above the windshield to see where he’s at. My heart skips and I feel like I got punched in the stomach when I see that he’s not only standing right up at the front of the bus, but he had been looking at me in the mirror while I was driving. My knee jerk reaction is to look back down at the road and right as my eyes hit the horizon he asks me a deeply concerning question “Usually there’s a lady that drives this route right? I can’t think of a time where I saw you out here before” Every alarm is going off in my head and I don’t even know what to reply with. My gut tells me to feed him a lie and end this conversation. “Yeah I don’t know honestly, I rarely get to see my coworkers so I don't know who else drives this route.” He nods his head slowly a few times, almost agreeing with me as he stares down the road ahead. Another long, silent pause. Going against my better judgement, I looked up in the mirror again and he did the exact same thing, almost like he was trying to anticipate my next move. He asks me how long I have been driving and if I have ever seen something strange out there.  

Somehow, I blurt out exactly what I was thinking. “Honestly you’re the first thing out here that has ever caught me off guard” his charismatic smile drops and is replaced with a seriously dark scowl. “Do you think I'm suspicious or something?” Now I have to land this conversation somehow without getting on his bad side and it feels like I am dangerously close. I start to feel my breathing get heavier. “No I don’t think you’re suspicious, I was just surprised to see someone out here at this time of night that’s all” This situation is rapidly escaping my control and I can feel myself backing into a psychological corner. He replies “Do you think I am a good person?” and I am at a loss for words. I started to plan what I can do if he attacks me. “No of course not, I think we’re both good people just having a conversation”. What he says next escalates the situation way further than I wanted to go. “Well you know sometimes bad things happen to good people right?” I look up and he’s just staring at me again in silence, suddenly he cracks a big smile and goes “I'm just kidding, I'm sorry. My sense of humor can sometimes throw people off.” and abruptly goes and sits down. All I can think is what the fuck is happening. I could radio in and try to call for the police but what if he hears me? I didn’t want to be strangled by this guy while I am driving this bus. He pulls the cord to request a stop on the bus. We’re still about 30 minutes from any population hub, but there's a campground nearby where he could go find someone else to talk to. At this point, I just want him off of my bus. Once we are close enough to the streetlights that mark the camping grounds, I ask him if this is where he wants to get off and he says “yeah this is good enough.” The doors hiss open again and I catch another whiff of the smell coming off of him. He thanks me for my time and for picking him up on the side of the road, and he asks me if I know if they've made any progress on finding that missing girl from a few weeks before. I was so glad he wasn’t on my bus that the question honestly went right over my head and I replied with a simple “I don't know of any missing girl honestly” and he smiles and nods. I close my door and drive off as he gives me a very unsettling wave goodbye. Taking one last look in my rear view mirror, I could see that he was still there just holding the waving position in the dark. Out loud, I ask myself what just happened. That whole situation felt like a fever dream. Never before had I been forced into such a terrifying and awful conversation with someone. 

I finished my run out to the coast and turned around to head back to Portland. On the way back, I pass by the campsite and he's nowhere to be seen thankfully. Further down the road, I start to get nauseous as I get closer to his truck. In a surprising and very scary turn of events, the truck is gone. In its place was a station wagon, filled with camping equipment. Now I knew something was up. This whole situation has felt off since the beginning and I know I need to file a police report when I get back to town. The rest of the trip home is all normal and I get off work and head home for the night. A couple days after the matter, I went in to file a police report for this guy's strange behaviour and the string of abandoned vehicles in the same part of the middle of a forest at night, and the police officers I spoke to got very serious, very quiet. They looked at each other with wide eyes and then asked me if I got his name. I told them it was Randy and they said that they appreciated my help and would reach out if they needed anything else. 

	A few weeks pass, and I am listening to the local news on the radio in the morning getting ready for my route. The newscaster is talking about the discovery of a missing girl just off of the OR6, the freeway I drive on my runs to the coast. They mentioned that they also had a suspect for the murder of a family at a campsite and the theft of their station wagon, his name was Randall Woodfield. My coffee cup shatters on the floor and shocks me out of my state. I started shaking with fear. I started to piece everything together and it sent me into a long spiral of depression and anxiety.

	That was the end of my time being a bus driver. My paranoia since this event has skyrocketed. I didn’t think I would ever come that close to interacting with someone who could truly be as evil as this man was. You never know what people are holding inside of themselves. Their secrets, their regrets, their desires. Please be careful when you are interacting with strangers, and if your gut tells you that something is wrong then you should absolutely listen to it. I could have prevented the murder of that family if I had radioed for police that night instead of waiting. Be careful out there. ",1,1768187461.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Her mom was surrendered to a shelter initially from what it would seem with 5 pups from her second litter, as well as at least one pup from her first, but different father. The picture of mom I recognized as piebald fawn, but from reading on American Bulldog genetics I do believe she had a copy of whitehead as well. Dad is assumed piebald black carrying brindle. Breeder kept solid white, piebald brindle, brindle with whitehead.  
Question is, if color breeding is so specific,  why not only cross double piebald to piebald to get only white, mostly white dogs? Did they likely not have a suitable dog and bred one? I came across a breeders Facebook page and I spit my coffee when he talked of the constant barrage of people insisting your dog is a pitbull or presa/corso when you have a mostly brindle. The 10 month old pup from first litter looked just like dog in breeders photo. The masked mostly fawn that is.
Mom for my pup obviously doesn't have two copies of whitehead from litter, but she had a really interesting eye patch, probably the donator of the melanistic mask? Not sure why she got dumped so young. 
There is a weight chart if you image search breed chart, My Orange is almost dead on with the dog named Justice but roughtly two weeks ahead. 5.5 months and 43 lbs.

For background, I come from a broken up family where my mom does drugs and dad has remarried. My bf comes from a asian family who moved here years ago but my bf used to stay with his grandpa in his own country and came here 5 years ago after his death.

His family lives in neighborhood and they're pretty well off. He was brought up in a very kind and gentle environment. His grandparents are the best people out there who were polite and loving their whole life and that reflects in his behavior and personality too.

His english is still a bit offshore, it's adorable and really really endearing when he looks for words to describe his feelings but ends up saying those in the wrong pronunciation. He's the prettiest thing ever...like really really pretty and absolutely charming.

We met through community work and I immediately wanted to know him more. Luckily we hit off good and I asked him out 3 months later. It's been 2 years now and we're still together. And mind you, he doesnt have many friends coz of communication skills and he's kind of an introvert too.

Thing is....he's too polite and gentle. Almost like a pushover.  He's still studying but I got myself a job now so whenever I've some extra work, I tell him to do it for me and he does it without another thought. Whenever I ask for money when I run low, he gives it with a smile. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I snap at him for asking if everything's alright. I snap at his mispronunciation, his mistakes with Grammer and sentences even though those arent even noticeable. I once threw a coffee down the drain coz I was pissed about my sister and then he messed up my coffee by trying to make me try his 'back home' version of coffee.

Even for that he apologised later saying he shouldn't have pushed me for something I didnt want to do.

I hate it when people take a second look at him when we're out. He's pretty I know but he's mine right? And with how polite he is, he smiles at them and greets them nicely, unknowingly raising their hopes to approach him even more. 

These past few weeks, he's been learning crocheting to control his anxiety and he makes me the sweetest things like Keychains, bracelets and covers for my bottle. 

What made me hit him is..I know its really fcked up but I've been stressed immensely about my work place. The employees are judgemental and higher ups are too annoying so I'm pissed off most of the time of the day.

And when I come home, he immediately comes to my place and YAPS about his day and asks for mine, even brings me various new crochet stuff and mind you my desk and cupboard are now full of those little pretty things. I've started to get annoyed at those and want to tell him to stop but instead of telling him..Last night I just snapped and threw what he got me (a bow and cherry hairclip) out the window.

He was hurt and expressed it but chose the wrong word and that just..pissed me off more so I shouted at him to shut the hell up. He was shocked, his face that I love so much had this..idk really confused and hurt look.

He stood up and gathered his stuff, apologised for coming but me being already worked up, I asked him where the hell was he going and he needs to sit his ass down until I calm down. 
I think he felt unsafe and kept muttering about now being not the time to talk and walked towards the door.

I dont know what came over me but I just yanked his hair and told him to sit on the couch and keep his mouth shut. He was scared, I saw the fear and idk..I think..I think I fed on it and snapped at him to sit and keep his mouth shut until I tell him to speak.

But he did open his mouth to say I was scaring him and he didn't feel good and I just, I dont know what happened but my anger flew off and I ended up slapping him while shouting at him to shut the hell up. Good thing...he pushed me off and ran away from me and my place.

I calmed down after an hour and two, realised what I did and how I treated him just for being loving and caring towards me. I went insane after hours and kept bombarding him with texts but he hasn't replied to any. I've tried calling but each goes to VM.

I know I'm the a-hole here but I just wanna ask how do I fix it? Is there any chance to get him to forgive me? Coz i really really love him and I dont wanna let him go.",0,1768187075.0,AITAH,28,0.25,False

Right now under U.S. tax rules every time you spend Bitcoin it’s technically a taxable event, even if you’re just buying a coffee. That’s been a real barrier for people who actually want to *use* Bitcoin as money instead of just holding it as an investment.

[Bitcoin.com News covered this idea a while back: the White House reiterated support for a “de minimis tax exemption” (around $600) on small BTC and crypto transactions](https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-trump-supports-600-crypto-tax-exemption/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) so that tiny payments wouldn’t trigger capital gains tax.

If this actually becomes law it could make real-world use cases a lot more attractive. Instead of thinking “I’d love to pay in Bitcoin but let’s not deal with taxes,” people might start just *using* Bitcoin day-to-day, at least for small purchases.

If small payments like coffee or groceries were tax-free, would you actually spend more Bitcoin?

1qajjqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BiscottiCareful1355/comments/1qajjqc/living_in_downtown_phoenix_guide_2026/,Living in Downtown Phoenix Guide (2026),"# Everything You Need to Know About Living in Downtown Phoenix

**Why this is not a copy-paste take**

I grew up in Phoenix and watched downtown change from an “event zone” into a real neighborhood. This post reflects that context plus practical, on-the-ground details people ask when considering a move to Arizona.

**Q: What's it like living in Downtown Phoenix?**  
A: Living in downtown Phoenix is a walkable, entertainment-rich, and transit-connected experience, but it comes with city realities like higher property crime, visible homelessness, and limited grocery stores.

I grew up in Phoenix. Not the Instagram version, the real one. For most of my childhood and teenage years, downtown Phoenix was not a place you “hung out.” You went there for a Suns game, maybe a concert, and then you left. **If you stayed after dark, people assumed either your car broke down or you were making questionable life choices.** Slight exaggeration, but not by much!

Back then, downtown was mostly government buildings, office towers, and sports venues surrounded by surface parking lots. The idea of meeting friends for dinner downtown on a random Tuesday night would have sounded about as realistic as dial up internet making a comeback in today’s world.

Fast forward about 40 years, and especially the last 15, and downtown Phoenix has undergone one of the biggest transformations in the Valley. It’s no longer just an event zone. It’s a real neighborhood now, with residents, schools, grocery stores, culture, and daily life happening well beyond game nights.

**Here’s what living in downtown Phoenix actually looks like today.**

### How has Downtown Phoenix changed over the years?

For decades, Phoenix developed outward, not upward. Suburbs exploded and downtown stagnated. That started changing in the late 2000s and accelerated after 2010 with major public and private investment: light rail expansion, ASU’s downtown campus, sports venue upgrades, residential towers, and arts-focused redevelopment around Roosevelt Row.

The opening of ASU’s Downtown Phoenix campus in 2006 brought a permanent student and faculty population. Valley Metro Light Rail began service in 2008, connecting downtown to Midtown, Tempe, and later Mesa ([Valley Metro Rail](https://www.valleymetro.org/)).

Since roughly 2010, downtown Phoenix has shifted from a pass-through district to one of the Valley’s primary entertainment, cultural, and urban residential hubs. Since 2020 alone, downtown has added more than 5,000 apartment units, with tons more planned or under construction.

### Where Downtown Phoenix Is Located

Downtown Phoenix is generally defined as the area bordered by McDowell Road to the north, 7th street to the west, Buckeye Rd to the south, and 7th ave to the east. But as a Phoenix native, we call downtown everything within the freeway circle of the I17 to the I17 to the 10 and the 10. In this blog though, Ill be pushing a bit further north to chat about everything below Thomas. I want to give you real insight from people who have lived here forever (me!), not some generic AI output or info from people who have never even been downtown. So, within the boundaries I mentioned above are Encanto, Willow, Coronado, Roosevelt Row, the Warehouse District, Portland St, the Central Avenue corridor, the civic and government core, and ASU’s downtown campus.

### Neighborhoods for Living in Downtown Phoenix

Roosevelt Row and Evans Churchill sit on the north and northeast side of the core and are where you’ll find the highest concentration of newer mid-rise apartment buildings, bars, coffee shops, murals, galleries, and First Friday traffic. If you want to walk to art, cocktails, and restaurants, this is the “I actually live downtown” zone most people picture. (For official downtown updates and initiatives: [Downtown Phoenix Inc.](https://dtphx.org/))

The Warehouse District is south of Washington and Jefferson near the ballpark. It’s where you’ll see more converted industrial character, newer high-rise clusters, and heavy event energy on game nights. It feels more sports and concerts than tree-lined neighborhood.

Portland Street is a real micro area people mention now because so much housing and retail has stacked up right around it. Broadstone Portland is one of the main examples. The vibe is apartment-forward with quick access to Roosevelt Row, Hance Park, and the light rail.

**Encanto sits north of the downtown core** and is where Phoenix starts to shift from true urban density into classic Central Phoenix. Encanto Park and Encanto Golf Course anchor the area and give it a very different feel from the warehouse districts and high-rise clusters downtown. More grass. More mature trees. More “old Phoenix.”

**Encanto Village** is not a single neighborhood. It is a large, official City of Phoenix Urban Village — a planning district used for zoning, transportation, and long-term growth. Encanto Village covers a wide area that includes parts of Midtown, major corridors along Central Avenue, institutional uses, parks, museums, light rail stops, medical offices, apartments, and multiple residential pockets. When the city says “Encanto,” this is usually what they mean.

**Encanto historic neighborhoods** are specific residential pockets within or near that larger village. Encanto-Palmcroft is the best-known (wide, palm-lined streets and early-20th-century architecture like Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial, and Mediterranean). Encanto Vista and Encanto Manor are smaller, primarily post-war areas with Ranch and mid-century homes and close proximity to the golf course and park. In short: Encanto Village is the big planning area; the historic neighborhoods are the character-driven residential sections inside it.

**Willo Historic District sits just just northwest of the downtown core**. It’s early-1900s through mid-century homes, historic overlays, and big pride-of-ownership energy. People who want character and a yard but still want to be minutes from downtown often end up looking here.

**Coronado is east of Central and north of the I-10 corridor,** full of historic bungalows, block construction, and remodels. It’s one of the most popular “I want central Phoenix, not suburban Phoenix” neighborhoods because it’s close to downtown without being in the middle of downtown.

**Garfield is closer to the downtown edge and still changing fast**. It has older homes, new builds, and infill. It’s one of the neighborhoods where you feel the transition in real time, street by street.

### Housing Options in Downtown Phoenix

### Apartments

**Downtown is primarily an apartment market.**

As of late 2025:

* Average rent: approximately $2,000 per month
* Studios: approximately $1,450
* One-bedroom: approximately $1,850 to $1,950
* Two-bedroom: $2,500 and up
* Sources include RentCafe, Zumper, and on-site property listings.

Examples of current downtown properties include Altura on Pierce, Camden Copper Square, Brix Warehouse District, Union at Roosevelt, X Phoenix, Aspire Fillmore, and Broadstone Portland. Newer high-rise developments are concentrated near Central Avenue, Roosevelt Street, and the Warehouse District.

More current pricing examples that people actually ask about, because these names come up constantly:

* Altura on Pierce tends to show wide rent ranges by unit type and floor, with studios and one beds commonly listed in the mid $1,000s and premium units higher.
* Broadstone Portland is often marketed as a Roosevelt Row and Hance Park adjacent building and regularly lists one and two bedroom pricing across the mid $1,000s into the $2,000s depending on unit size and timing.
* X Phoenix is one of the higher-profile high-rise style communities downtown and tends to price above older mid-rise stock, especially on larger units and higher floors.
* Union at Roosevelt is right in the center of Roosevelt Row foot traffic and typically sits in the newer-build pricing tier.

Prices fluctuate monthly and do not include taxes, parking, or amenity fees.

### Condos and Townhomes

Limited but available. Most are concentrated near Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the Warehouse District.

Prices typically range from the mid-$300,000s to $700,000 and higher depending on the building, views, parking, and HOA structure.

Inventory is far smaller than apartments, which keeps pricing relatively firm.

If you want condo and townhome living instead of a lease, you usually end up shopping in a few predictable places:

* Mid-rise condo style buildings near Roosevelt Row and the arts district core.
* Central Avenue corridor buildings where you trade a monthly HOA for views, security, and walkability.
* Townhome pockets on the downtown edge, especially as you move into Coronado and parts of Encanto and Willo where the built form shifts from towers to smaller attached housing.

### Single-Family Homes

Rare within the downtown core, but available in adjacent historic neighborhoods such as Roosevelt Historic District, Willo, Encanto, and Garfield.

These areas offer early-20th-century homes, tree-lined streets, and historic preservation overlays. Prices often range from $600,000 to well over $1 million depending on condition, lot size, and historic designation.

Willo tends to skew higher because the historic district brand is strong, the streets feel established, and the home styles are the kind people move here for: pre-war and mid-century homes, brick and stucco, bigger lots, mature landscaping, and a real neighborhood grid you can walk.

Encanto can jump fast because of the park and golf course proximity and the feel of the area.

Coronado is often slightly more accessible than Willo but still not “cheap,” and it has a huge number of 1930s to 1950s bungalows and block homes that remodel well.

Garfield is where you can still see more price spread because it’s actively changing, and the mix of original homes, flips, and new infill varies block by block.

### Crime and Safety (The Real Version)

Downtown Phoenix has higher reported crime rates than suburban Phoenix, particularly for property crime. This is typical of dense, urban cores. ([Phoenix Police Crime Statistics](https://www.phoenix.gov/police/resources-information/crime-stats-and-maps))

Violent crime exists but is concentrated in specific pockets and tends to be situational rather than random. Most residents report that daily life feels safe when using basic city awareness.

The homelessness crisis is visible downtown. “The Zone,” a large encampment, was cleared in 2023, but homelessness remains an ongoing citywide issue rather than one isolated to downtown. (City resources: [City of Phoenix Downtown Development](https://www.phoenix.gov/communitydevelopment))

Sources include Phoenix Police Department crime statistics, the Maricopa Association of Governments, and the City of Phoenix Human Services Department.

### Walkability and Transportation

**Downtown Phoenix is one of the most walkable areas in the Valley.**

* Light Rail costs $2 per ride and connects downtown to Midtown, Uptown, Tempe, and Mesa.
* Walk Scores typically range from 70 to 90 depending on location.
* Bike infrastructure has expanded significantly around Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the downtown core.
* Driving times during off-peak hours are approximately ten minutes to Sky Harbor Airport, five to ten minutes to Midtown Phoenix, fifteen minutes to Tempe, and twenty to twenty-five minutes to Scottsdale.

Traffic is light by big-city standards but heavier during games, concerts, and festivals.

### Entertainment, Sports and Nightlife

Living downtown puts you near the Suns, Mercury, and Diamondbacks. The Suns and Mercury play downtown at the arena that was formerly Footprint Center. The Diamondbacks play at Chase Field. These venues anchor downtown and are a major reason the area stayed relevant even before people lived there. (Arena naming coverage: [AZFamily](https://www.azfamily.com/))

Major concert and performance venues include Arizona Financial Theatre, The Van Buren, Crescent Ballroom, Orpheum Theatre, and Symphony Hall. It is realistic to walk to NBA games, WNBA games, MLB games, concerts, comedy shows, and festivals. That was not a thing when I was growing up.

**Big recurring events that actually change traffic, parking, and the feel of downtown:**

* First Friday on Roosevelt Row.
* Diamondbacks home stands and big weekend series.
* Major touring shows at The Van Buren and Arizona Financial Theatre.
* Large conventions and expo weekends tied to the Phoenix Convention Center.
* Holiday events and seasonal markets that concentrate around CityScape, Heritage Square, and the Roosevelt corridor.

### Restaurants, Bars and Coffee

**Downtown Phoenix is now one of the strongest food districts in the Valley.**

Standout restaurants include Pizzeria Bianco, Bacanora, Wren and Wolf, Flour and Thyme, Sottise, and Cornish Pasty Co., which has been a downtown staple long before the area’s resurgence became obvious.

Bars include Bitter and Twisted, Little Rituals, The Theodore, Valley Bar, and the downtown AZ Wilderness taproom. Several have received national recognition for cocktail programs.

Local coffee shops and daytime spots include Lola Coffee, Songbird Coffee and Tea House, Futuro, Xanadu Coffee, Press Coffee, and Fair Trade Cafe, which also doubles as a local art space.

Yoga and wellness exists downtown in a way it simply did not when I was younger. A lot of residents treat Hance Park and the Roosevelt corridor like their daily routine zone: coffee, walk, class, work, repeat.

### Arts, Culture and History

Roosevelt Row remains Phoenix’s primary arts district, filled with murals, galleries, studios, and boutiques. First Friday, held monthly, is one of the largest recurring art walks in the country and draws tens of thousands of people.

Downtown is home to major cultural institutions including the Phoenix Art Museum, the largest art museum in the Southwest with over 20,000 works, and the Heard Museum, founded in 1929 and internationally respected for Native American art and history. ([Phoenix Art Museum](https://phxart.org/) • [Heard Museum](https://heard.org/))

Burton Barr Central Library is a five-story, 280,000-square-foot civic anchor featuring an interior water feature, gallery space, and public study areas.

The Arizona Science Center is downtown and is one of the most underrated “normal life” amenities for people with kids or visiting family. It’s also right next to Heritage Square, which is one of the few places downtown where you can still feel older Phoenix architecture without trying too hard. ([Arizona Science Center](https://www.azscience.org/))

The Children’s Museum of Phoenix is also downtown and is one of those places locals actually use on weekends when you have toddlers and you need to burn energy without melting outside. ([Children’s Museum of Phoenix](https://childrensmuseumofphoenix.org/))

St. Mary’s Basilica is downtown and it’s one of the clearest reminders that Phoenix is not just new build subdivisions and strip malls. It’s one of the most photographed churches in the city for a reason. ([St. Mary’s Basilica](https://stmarysbasilica.org/))

### Historic Hotels and Buildings

Hotel San Carlos still operates and hosted Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. Westward Ho was once Phoenix’s tallest building and housed numerous Hollywood figures. The Luhrs Tower, built in 1929, remains one of the city’s best examples of Art Deco architecture. The Orpheum Theatre, also opened in 1929, continues to host performances under its original ornate ceiling.

Hotel San Carlos is also one of the most talked-about “haunted” locations downtown. The haunting stories are local legend and part of the building’s pop culture identity.

More historic places people forget to mention when they copy and paste the same four buildings:

* Heritage Square and the Rosson House area, which is one of the best preserved pieces of old Phoenix in the downtown footprint.
* Union Station and the old rail influence, which matters because transportation shaped early Phoenix growth patterns long before light rail was a thing.

Downtown Phoenix has one of the highest concentrations of preserved historic architecture in the Valley.

### Schools, Demographics and Daily Life

ASU’s downtown campus houses programs in journalism, public service, nursing, law, and health sciences. Public K-12 schools within the core are limited, with more options in adjacent neighborhoods. Charter and private schools are available nearby.

Downtown residents skew toward professionals, students, creatives, and empty nesters, though the demographic mix continues to broaden as more housing comes online.

Encanto and Willo pull a different demographic than the apartment core. More long-term owners, more established households, more people who want a yard and a historic home but still want to be close to downtown. Coronado splits the difference with a mix of owners, renters, remodel buyers, and people who want central Phoenix but do not want a tower.

### Grocery Stores and Practical Realities

Grocery access remains a weak spot. Fry’s Food and Drug opened downtown in 2019, becoming the first new downtown grocery store in over fifty years. A Safeway on McDowell Road serves nearby neighborhoods but is not walkable for most residents. Smaller markets and specialty shops exist, but downtown is not grocery-dense.

The real downtown grocery reality is still this: most people either plan their trips or they supplement with delivery, smaller markets, and convenience shopping.

### Middle Housing and What It Could Change

Arizona passed a middle housing law that pushes cities toward allowing smaller multifamily housing types in more places. What that means in normal person language is more legal pathways for duplexes, triplexes, fourplex style housing, and similar “in-between” housing in areas that were historically locked into single-family zoning. ([Arizona State Legislature HB2721 summary](https://www.azleg.gov/))

How it could affect areas around downtown within the parameters of the law:

* Coronado, Garfield, and parts of the downtown edge are the most likely to see more small-scale infill and redevelopments that are not full high-rises.
* It can increase housing supply gradually without requiring a tower.
* It can also increase teardown pressure in some pockets if land values support redevelopment.
* It will not instantly change Willo and Encanto the way people on the internet pretend it will, because historic overlays, lot patterns, and neighborhood politics still matter in real life.

### Is Downtown Phoenix Worth Living In?

**Downtown Phoenix today is walkable, cultural, entertainment-rich, and transit-connected. It is still evolving.**

**It is not suburban, quiet, grocery-heavy, or free of urban issues.**

If you want a true urban lifestyle in Arizona, downtown Phoenix is the closest thing the Valley offers. And as someone who watched it go from a place you avoided after dark to a place you walk to dinner and a concert, the change is real.

### FAQ

**Is downtown Phoenix walkable?**

Yes. It’s one of the most walkable areas in the Valley, especially around Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the downtown core.

**What’s the biggest downside of living in downtown Phoenix?**

Urban tradeoffs: higher property crime than suburbs, visible homelessness, and grocery access that’s still thinner than most people expect.

**Are there single-family homes downtown?**

They’re rare in the core, but you’ll find more options in adjacent historic neighborhoods like Willo, Encanto, Coronado, and Garfield.

**How close is Sky Harbor from downtown?**

About ten minutes during off-peak hours (driving), which is one reason downtown works well for frequent travelers.

**Which downtown areas feel most “neighborhood” vs “event zone”?**

Roosevelt Row/Evans Churchill read as the most “I live here” walkable zone; the Warehouse District skews more event-heavy on game and concert nights.

1qajj63,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakechristianchloe/comments/1qajj63/first_snark_rant/,first snark (rant),"rant!! i’ve been a quiet snarker but i just wanted to put my thoughts out there.. i honestly feel bad that she got pregnant and married so young, i feel like she had so much potential with how many views her channel was bringing in and how young she is. I really do feel like she should try to make friends, and could’ve benefitted from the all of the fun content like “girls night in” just playing games and listening to music, “go on a hike with us” “cabin trip” or even just with her husband. There are plenty of christian influencers with similar values as her. I also think that youtube is dead and i’m surprised that she’s even getting enough views for a snark page coming from someone that posts hour long videos with short form being so popular. it may be obvious in this rant but i never watch the full vlogs and i usually skip around her yapping.. Tiktok, snapchat and instagram is where it’s at. I never understood being a youtuber and not being on other social media i feel like that where the familiarity comes from when ur not posting on youtube or they aren’t going on youtube people won’t forget about you if you post a simple coffee cup on instagram story. I definitely think that she should move her content to those apps because thats where the money and engagement is. hour long videos of her doing nothing but shopping and rambling is boring. Maybe if she was traveling or road tripping (another content idea) to a different state or a stay in another city nothing crazy expensive or taking rhythm or even herself out somewhere actual fun (because I’m not too big on putting your child on social media) on outings like arcades or interactive museums is fun. a shorter series of her trying new things like yoga or maybe fun challenges with all the products she has like blind fold body routine would be something i’d watch. I saw a girl on tiktok do a series where she created a body routine for influencers and mailed it to them. Another content idea would be uploading pictures or songs on tiktok and making a body routine that gave off that vibe because people are obsessed with aesthetics!!

1qajhsq,https://i.redd.it/lhghvqmd3ucg1.jpeg,The Drop movie night open to everyone 18+ at Marine Park Coffee,"Join us on Friday, January 23rd at 6:00 PM for a cozy winter Movie Night at Marine Park Coffee. This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area. Everyone from southern Brooklyn is welcome to join, including those from Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Sunset Park, and beyond—we are proud to bring together people from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting the gathering and making the space available for a private community event.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

Please RSVP on Partiful so we can plan accordingly:
https://partiful.com/e/a5GxsHmmMg5NlYy6FKDc?c=yPlYsAFZ

We hope you’ll join us for a great film, good company, and an evening centered on community.

1qajh8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1qajh8g/noticable_buzzing_noise_coming_from_old_screwin/,Noticable buzzing noise coming from old screw-in fuse box.,"This fuse box has been in my house for over 20 years ever since my Dad moved in but has never really had this issue until recently. We need advice for this type of thing because at the moment we cannot afford a certified technician to come look at it so I decided to post to this subreddit to get some advice for what to look out for and what to do before we try to do so.

Our fuse box has always had problems with burning fuses, like simple ones. Like if we run 2 appliances at once in our kitchen off the same fuse (such as a coffee maker and a microwave, or a microwave and a toaster oven) the fuse will burn out and we have to replace it. But this is not the issue I am talking about. We have started to notice some unusual buzzing coming from our box.

The first time it happened we were running a microwave off of a singular fuse (this was the only appliance running at the time) and we began to hear an extremely ear piercing buzz coming from the fuse box. We immediately turned off the microwave and my Dad told me to go over to the fuse box and listen for a buzz when he turned on the microwave again but there was nothing anymore.

Today was the second time it happened and we are still oblivious about the whole thing. Our electric water heater was installed about 15 years ago along with a brand new Jumper cable by my Papa and it has worked perfectly fine ever since. The only worrisome thing that has ever been of that water heater ever since is that sometimes the fuse will get a little warm if the heater is running for long periods of time (e.g. 30+ mins) which I think is fairly normal for an old fuse box like this.

But today we were doing dishes and as I walked by the box I noticed a very distinct buzzing noise coming from the fuse box. This buzzing went on for over 20 minutes before stopping. The only fuse that was noticeably hot to the touch was the fuse that the water heater was on (note: the water heater is the only one on that fuse) and we concluded it was that fuse. But after the buzzing stopped, even after taking 3 10 minute showers and doing a bit of a load on the heater the buzzing never continued.

What could this be, what should we look out for, and what is some advice on this? Any help is appreciated!",2,1768186829.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

One spring day in Osavine, Claire Miller sat in the Miller Mansion’s cozy drawing room. She sat by the fireplace, reading an Anglic book with full attention.

Suddenly, a large envelope slammed onto the coffee table in front of her with a loud bang, the gust of wind stirring the hair by her cheeks.

“You don’t belong here. Get out of this house,” Ashley Miller shouted as she marched toward Claire.

“Ashley, what are you making a scene about now?” Claire’s voice was soft, but a slight frown touched her brow as she looked up at Ashley, her elder sister.

The Miller family had three children. Samuel Miller, the eldest, was in college. Ashley, the second, was in high school. And Claire was the youngest.

“Claire Miller, no, Claire Brown. You’re not my sister at all. Get out of here, right now, this minute.” Ashley pointed fiercely toward the door.

Claire went still. She picked up the envelope from the coffee table and opened it. Her eyes narrowed in shock. Inside was a document showing she was not a Miller by blood.

Adam Miller and Jennifer Miller stepped into the living room just then, with a shy, plainly dressed girl trailing behind them. The girl was about Claire’s age.

Claire rose to her feet, holding the document high. “Dad, Mom, is this true?” she asked, her voice trembling. She couldn’t believe the words on the page.

Jennifer’s eyes were red as she took Claire’s hand. “Darling, I can’t believe it either,” she said, her voice thick. “I’ve treasured you like a precious gem for fifteen years. How can you not be my own?”

Adam’s face was stern. “Since it’s a mistake, it must be set right,” he stated firmly. “Your real parents are outside, waiting for you.”

“Hurry up and go. This is my real sister,” Ashley cut in sharply. Pulling the quiet Livia Miller forward, she staged a tight, sisterly hug for Claire to see.

Livia kept her head down, as if she didn’t dare look Claire in the eye. But inside, she was laughing wildly. ‘I’m finally back. Last time, I was stupid and died soon after returning to the Millers. This time, I’ll make sure I stay as the richest man’s daughter.’

Claire looked at each of them, then gently pulled her hand away from Jennifer’s hold. “If it’s a mistake, then it should be fixed,” she said softly. Her voice was still sweet, but her tone was steady. Jennifer seemed unable to let go.

“Just get out. Go back to your poor family,” Ashley snapped. “You’ve got eight brothers who eat like they’ve never seen food. Watch out, Claire, your new parents might just sell you off for their sake.” She looked ready to drag Claire out herself.

Without another word, Claire walked straight out of Miller Mansion. At the gate stood a middle-aged couple waiting. The man wore work clothes, and the woman was dressed plainly.

Both of them were good-looking. When they saw Claire, their expressions grew complicated, but they stepped forward at once.

“Are you Claire?” asked Joyce Brown, Claire’s birth mother. After Claire nodded, Joyce took her hand. “Come, let’s go home.”

Henry Brown, Claire’s birth father, added, “Yes, let’s go home and talk.” And so, Claire followed her real parents back to where they lived.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Browns lived in a small, three-room rented apartment down an alley off Qranta Road, near Osavine High School. There were eleven people in the family altogether.

Before Claire’s arrival, the room arrangement had remained unchanged for years: her parents shared one, Livia had her own, and all eight brothers slept in the third.

The floor was peeling at the edges. The walls were scuffed, with a few old posters stuck to them. The room was full of worn-out things: a sagging couch, a shaky table, and an old TV.

Shabby as it was, the place was tidy and clean. It couldn’t have been more different from the grand Miller Mansion. In that moment, the huge gap between rich and poor felt real and stark.

“I know it’s not what you’re used to,” Henry said with a gentle smile. “Your mother always says education comes first. Every penny we earn goes toward the children’s schooling.”

Joyce nodded. “Just because we’re poor now doesn’t mean we will always be. If you and your brothers work hard at your studies, one day things will get better.”

Henry nodded eagerly. “Yes, your mom’s right about that.” Claire understood quickly: here, Joyce was the strict one, and Henry the soft one. Back at the Millers’, it had been just the opposite.

Joyce guided Claire to a chair. “Let me tell you how things are with us,” she began. “Your father works at a factory. He brings home about two thousand a month.

“I do some small business. My pay isn’t regular. Some months it’s a few hundred, others it can be four thousand. We rent this place. We don’t own anything, but we don’t owe anyone, either. And you have eight brothers.”",1,1768186607.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1qajdvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1qajdvi/my_mentally_ill_dad_recently_passed_away_and_i/,"My mentally ill dad recently passed away, and I don’t know exactly how to feel about it.","On December 1st, 2025, my dad, who had bipolar disorder, died from a heart attack while he was living in Puerto Rico. 

The year before he died, he moved from the mainland United States to Puerto Rico while he was still in a manic episode that lasted well over two years. He had been getting in trouble with the law while he was living in the U.S. 

He made reckless decisions, threatened to kill his family, burn down my family’s house while we were inside, and he got arrested multiple times for trespassing on property he’d already been banned from. He was also hospitalized because he attacked police officers and nurses after one of his arrests. He took advantage of people’s kindness wherever he could and often threatened to harm them when they called him out for his behavior. 

I was in my sophomore year of college in 2023, when my dad’s manic episode started. That spring, he and my mother separated because he was already threatening to hurt her and my grandmother who had been living with us. 

While he was on his own, he drove up to my college campus and asked me to pay for his gas as well as a hotel room for him to stay at. All because he left his wallet at a stranger’s home he’d stayed at. I had very little money at the time, and I was only twenty-years-old so I was not able to pay for a hotel room for him to stay at. Thus, he manipulated me and took advantage of my kindness so he could sleep in my dorm room, while my roommate was in her part of our room. Thankfully, we had a double bedroom, but it was so inappropriate because I was in an all female dorm at the time and he knew he could get what he wanted from me.

I was angry with myself for not telling him to go elsewhere, but I was scared he would explode on me. I also feel so bad for my roommate and the awkwardness she must have felt that night. She was kind enough to lend my dad one of her blankets. 

He left the morning after. 

Skipping ahead to 2025, during my senior year of college, my dad already moved to Puerto Rico. For what reason? I’m not entirely sure, but he was Puerto Rican himself, been to the island many times over the course of his life, his family was there, and he started a coffee plantation. Not as successful as he made it out to be. He had one or two employees on the property he was utilizing for the plantation, not hardly any of the proper equipment or the number of staff for his business to flourish. 

For over a year, during 2024, he made group chats that included me and most of my family and random people I’d never met, where he verbally and emotionally attacked his family and friends. I did everything I could to distance myself from him at the time because I could not bear to hear his negative comments about how everyone wronged him when he made the choices he did. 

When I found out he’d died, I was shocked, as anyone would be. He was my father, and while I miss him and the happy times we shared together, he was abusive emotionally and physically to his past wives and my half brothers. He manipulated me, my little sister, my mother, and my grandparents. He emotionally and verbally abused me and everyone in my family and our community. I’m angry that his mental health did not get taken care of properly mostly because he did not have the insight to realize he had a mental illness, but also because the American health care system and mental health system failed him. 

He was ill for the entire time I knew him, and throughout his marriage to my mother. I was constantly afraid of his explosive behavior while he was manic growing up, and my sister and I had to stay with friends while my mother worked. It was dangerous to be around him for so long, and my mind is still in a state of fight or flight in a way. 

I hate that my mother was treated so poorly during her marriage and I know she tried to divorce him multiple times, but it never worked out until right before he died because of my father’s ability to manipulate and control anyone he wanted to. 

I’ve been grieving throughout this past month, and unfortunately, he died the day before my 23rd birthday. I’m glad that I at least found out the day after. I’m relieved in some ways that he’s gone because he can no longer hurt me or anyone else. He’s also no longer suffering from his mental illness, his severe type two diabetes, high blood pressure, the horrors he saw while he was serving in the army, and so many other conditions that ultimately contributed to his death at 73. 

I’m just wondering what things someone like me can do to cope with this grief? The grief of losing a parent with whom I had a very complicated and often painful relationship with? But with whom I always felt loved and supported by in various ways. 

Thank you, and I’m sending all those who have lost someone dear to them lots of prayers and love your way. ",2,1768186572.0,GriefSupport,2,1.0,False

We met and spoke online for years before meeting in person. We had proper conversations. Though he did say that I talked more about myself than he did himself, and I didn't fully agree with that. We did a lot of arguing, intiated by him. If I tried to talk about my feelings, especially in regards to him or the relationship, he'd blank me. For a while he asked what's wrong but then told me all we talked about was me, my feelings, and that I didn't care about him. 

He argued with me over not being sexual, and my reasons why, eventually making me feel pressured to engage. A lot of our conversations were sexual, and it seemed to be all he was interested in. He told me he was too depressed to talk for weeks yet messaged me to speak sexually, promising me he'd spend time with me after that, but then not doing so. He got upset with me for talking to my friends, called them fake, and accused me of being able to replace people easily. He also got upset when I didn't respond fast, or enthusiastically enough. 

When we met in person, he didn't seem interested in me, in more ways than one. He spent time with me, at first, but after a while he stopped wanting to do things. Months into being together, after I went back to the UK with him, I felt alone. It was a hassle to get him to do anything with me, other than watch things, which he didn't always do. I'd ask to go on walks and he'd agree, and then change his mind, and promise to go the next day but wouldn't. He wouldn't care when that upset me. I asked to take baths together, which he didn't always seem interested in. When we did he he was glued to his phone, not talking to me, not listening. 

I'd sit there for an hour with him on his phone. I got upset several times and he'd tell me he was going to put it down, but wouldn't. We went places and he was glued to his phone as we walked around. I'd lose him because he wouldn't see that I had walked off. We would go for coffee and he'd be on his phone, and I'd try to talk to him to no avail. I complained about it upsetting me, and being awkward, and he acted like it was normal pointing out other people who were on their phones. Or he'd say that what he was looking at was important, which it was sometimes, but also said he just liked scrolling Facebook. 

He said that I was also on my phone questioning why I was bothered. Whenever I put my phone down to talk to him, and picked it back up when it didn't happen. After dozens of times of getting upset over this, I gave up. I went to leave with the coffee right after getting it, and he asked me why, and told me that he put his phone away. I had my phone out one of the times we were getting coffee, and he told me to put it away because it was awkward, and I did. He admitted he was a hypocrite. He later used it against me, saying I'd done the same thing to him. 

It's always been a hassle to get him to spend time, to talk to me, and it seems he doesn't want to. He went weeks at a time staying up all night, editing YouTube videos or doing other things, and not spending time with me. He called me codependent and needy for being upset over this, and suggested I find my own hobby. He complained about not getting any space when from my perspective, he was always getting space. On my birthday a few years back he paid for an Airbnb for the night. He was watching Elton John at Glastonbury, and did so longer than he said he would. 

I asked him to at least sit out with me on the patio, and he didn't. I asked him after he was done to take a bath, and he said that he would, but after sitting in the bath alone for 20mins I got out. Most of what we do together is watch things or play video games, and sometimes he doesn't seem interested in that. He will agree to do it and then won't, seemingly preferring to watch or play things alone, opting to do so after I've asked to do it together. For ages we didn't go anywhere. He blamed it on various reasons from sleep to a lack of money. When he went places with others on little sleep. 

When what I wanted to do didn't require much or any money. I'd struggle to talk to him because of how glued to his phone he was. He would insist that he was listening, but then ask me to repeat myself, and get frustrated with me for being upset and say that I was overreacting. He'd read comments whilst I spoke, and would pick his phone up to check something, or scroll Facebook while I was talking. He's different with other people, and actually talks to them. He puts his phone down. He kind of has to as he's studying to become a counselor when he doesn't care about my feelings, doesn't listen to them, or argues with me over them. 

A majority of the time conversations about my feelings turn into arguments. He doesn't remember a lot of what I tell him. He's asked me several times if I like certain foods I've never said I liked, or that I said I didn't like. We went to America last Christmas to visit family. He's always given more attention to my mother. Every trip he talks to her more, follows her around in public. I'd try to talk to him, just for a minute, and he'd say he can't talk to both of us at once before turning back to her. I got upset over this one time, said I felt ignored, which resulted in him screaming and kicking things after I tried to calmly talk about it.

During the last visit, he walked around with her in public, and acted completely different with her than he does me in public. He goes quiet on me, claims he dislikes talking around others, and constantly looks around and focuses on other people (usually women) He didn't do that with my mother. He spoke to her and then snapped at me many of the times I tried to talk to him, telling me that he was overstimulated or had a headache, before going back to speaking and joking with her. I tried to talk about this upsetting me and he denied he was ignoring me, but also asked could he not choose who he speaks to. 

I did the same thing back to him, snapping that I was overstimulated, after speaking to my mother and he told me not to, and was just as irked by it. When I didn't want to come back, as I usually don't, he begged me to and promised to change several things he does including listening to me. He swore he wouldn't be as glued to his phone. When we came back for a few weeks he wasn't as glued to it. But then he picked it up when I was speaking, and put it down, a few times. One of the times he said sorry and that he wouldn't do it again, but then he did. 

He did it again and told me, whenever I got upset, that I was overreacting. On my birthday he was glued to his phone looking at things to buy. He made up for how awful my birthday was by offering to take me back to where we were, and promising not to do the same things, but then he did. He was glued to his phone and turns out, he bought a tv, and wasted the little time we had on that. He's been on his phone less but is often distracted by other things, or distracted in general. Even when he's not doing something he doesn't listen, or take in all of what I said. 

For the past two weeks, he's argued with me and appears to be more irritable with me, he's also listened to me less and has spent less time with me. He keeps asking what every time I say anything. He also keeps saying I said things I didn't say, the opposite of what I said, insisting he's listening. He's gotten frustrated a few times I've been upset over it, and refused to repeat myself. He apologized for reacting that way, said he wouldn't again, and then did a day later. He told me before that we are together so much, he doesn't have anything to talk about. 

He's also said I'm not interested in what he has to talk about. He's criticised the things I talk about, and share with him, even when I don't share them often. He's told me that he's a guy and he's not interested, and has been annoyed over it, including after he told me that he wanted to see and hear about whatever it was. He said he didn't mean it but said it again, and again. Today he said it. He was also reading a post when I was speaking to him, and insisted he was listening, and excused it by saying he was already reading the post when I came back. 

He's admitted before to not being able to multitask, to use his phone and listen, but then says other times he can though it's obvious he can't. If he's not on his phone, he is distracted by something else. Earlier today he looked at his phone and started to scratch his jeans to get something off of them, unable to give me a few mins of his undivided attention. He expects different treatment when he speaks to me, or tries to show me something, wanting me to immediately put my phone down. Sometimes I think he does these things on purpose to make me feel small. 

He got frustrated with me today for being upset, and saying I felt he doesn't listen to me, or want to talk to me. He kept saying that he does want to, before complaining that he had to keep reassuring me. ",2,1768186546.0,TwoHotTakes,17,0.75,False

I love, a love that’s loud.

It’s vast and endless without fail.

It’s bright; a firework following a sparking tail 

It’s seen; a blazing star, shooting in the sky 

It’s keen to all things momentary 

One of which we are. 



It’s quite transparent in the light 

The warmest kiss,

a sweet delight 

It’s swimming in between your legs 

Like a ocean ballerina on the kegs 

She changes shapes on shoulder blades 

On thinnest skin between our neck 

On every single little freck.

Between the night and day



And in this love that’s loud I love

I use it’s roots to branch beneath me 

Strong and willowed , ancient trees 

I use its leaves to guide me softly 

To the valleys in your heart 

To the meadows of your chest 

To the secret that you hold 

Till the end has given rest. 



But a love that’s loves me 

It is quiet. 

It’s a breeze that follows suite

It’s a little quiet morning

With a coffee and a beaut.

It doesn’t yell - it doesn’t shout 

It lays there gently on my couch.

It opens up its starry arms 

Allows myself to disregard 

All the negativities I’ve learnt

The words - the struggle 

The dirt.



It lays me naked in its presence 

Without the vanity of clothing. 

It doesn’t make me get undressed

To see the oaths I’ve sworn to holdin.

It doesn’t need to see my body 

To see the things that I hold deep

It takes it time to heal the wounds

That others bandaged on a heap.

It doesn’t scream when dishes break

Or ask my faucet to stop leaking 

It takes a wrench , it shuts it off 

Carries on completely sneaking 

Little whispers in my ear

The sun - the moon 

The love I fear. 



So while I strangle with my love

It loves me back with quiet doves 

It sends me notes of yearn and need

It pleads to love me how I bleed.

Without it pouring out of me.

It wants to be without a fee

Every single part of me. 

So , I love , a love that’s loud.

But a love that loves me. 

Quiets down.

I thought it would be fairly easy, but looking at my route and riding around, man do I feel very small and out of place on the road.


I've noticed a pattern, I'm planning to ride farther and farther out, eventually do test rides to my job, which is 5 miles away / from San Fernando to sylmar, except I'm only riding from my mom who I currently take care of to my place which is about a mile a part.

I keep putting it off going father, taking alternative routes, or going much else where. 


How do I get past this hurdle? On one had it's just general.... embarrassment? I feel silly here in LA county being a 24 year old dude riding a bike when according to LA standards, I should have a car, along with being overweight/ general being slow. Also a genuine sense of fear for safety, what if I turn right and they don't see me? What if I get bumped or heckled cause I can't go instantly 20mph from a stand still? How do I deal with awkwardness at lights or stop signs? Where I don't know if I should go or not and they just stay there?


Sorry if this all sounds silly, I like riding and find it a lot of fun and really want to stick with it, and eventually head to and from work, errands, food, coffee, etc.",4,1768186538.0,BikeLA,15,1.0,False
1qajd0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1qajd0g/how_ive_helped_my_adhd_and_hashimotos_without/,How I’ve helped my ADHD and hashimotos without medication,"I am unfortunate enough to have AUDHD with hashimotos and ulcerative colitis AND chronic vertigo. I couldn’t take ADHD medication as unfortunately my body reacted badly to it and gave me a flu like reaction and severe brain fog, I have taken Levo (no problems with this) in the past but my TSH was apparently normal so I couldn’t take it?? But antibodies cooked which was making me feel awful. Instead I just took the natural alternative as I felt like I didn’t have a choice. I think I’ve finally found a workable routine which has helped my overall gut health and is alleviating my spiralling anxiety. This sounds like a lot and may be overwhelming to read but it’s helped me immensely and if you do at least one or two of these that suit you I would highly recommend the face blood flow massage every morning as the main one. Also you can do some of the non supplement techniques on medication it doesn’t really matter it’s all good for you, supplements are things I would choose wisely and be careful with too though. So here it goes:

Morning: 
- Face, neck and scalp massage for blood flow to help chronic pain and tiredness (huge game changer)
- 50ml of pure aloe Vera juice
- a pyscobiotic probiotic mix (life space is the only one I don’t have a histamine reaction to), my thyrobalance supplement (helps my hashimotos)
- green tea
- a large coffee (I’m talking like 4 teaspoons Instant coffee with coconut milk, tumeric, cinnamon and nutmeg)
- nervous system breathing (in 4 seconds, hold 2 seconds and out of mouth 7 seconds) 
- whim hoff breathing (this is great and no you don’t have to do it everyday - I tend to forget)
- vertigo safe - weighted workout (dm me but I just do 100 star jumps to warm up, then rotate legs, arms and core everyday and I do light weights 
- vestibular excersizes (takes 2 mins)
- opening shoulder stretch on a doorframe (10-30 seconds)

Lunch 
400 ml coconut water 
Banana

Afternoon 
Banana (yes that’s right twice a day)
If I find myself lacking focus at work I’ll take glutamine which feels an equivalent to adhd medication but it makes me a little dizzy so I refuse to take it in the morning, astanxanthin helps with focus too but I think it was making me flare up so I stopped but it may help others 

Evening 
I take a another probiotic (this one is for urinary tract this is more a personal thing - probs more to help with utis etc)
Valerian and magnesium forte by RN labs 
Bed at 9pm and try wake up at 6am to keep that circadian rhythm healthy 

Please let me know if you have any questions I’d be happy to explain the Method behind the madness and I note I have not cured myself whatever that means but the symptoms are more manageable and this helped my mental health a lot.

1qaj8im,https://i.redd.it/t5yr8kna1ucg1.jpeg,The Drop movie night open to everyone 18+ at Marine Park Coffee,"Join us on Friday, January 23rd at 6:00 PM for a cozy winter Movie Night at Marine Park Coffee. This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area. Everyone from southern Brooklyn is welcome to join, including those from Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Sunset Park, and beyond—we are proud to bring together people from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting the gathering and making the space available for a private community event.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

Since we stopped working together about 5 months ago we’ve caught up several times for brunch and coffee/walks.

The second time we caught up we went to brunch, he picked me up, paid for breakfast and bought us each a glass of French champagne to toast my new job. I worry that I misread that catch up and didn’t capitalise on it.

I’ve invited him out for a drink at a Spanish wine/tapas bar and wondering how he might be interpreting this invite … keen for some male opinions please?",5,1768186166.0,AskMen,18,0.78,False

1qaj80k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadAhead/comments/1qaj80k/searching_meaning_of_life/,searching meaning of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1768186131.0,DeadAhead,1,1.0,False
1qaj7zz,https://i.redd.it/2qd8b4h61ucg1.jpeg,The Drop movie night open to everyone 18+ at Marine Park Coffee,"Join us on Friday, January 23rd at 6:00 PM for a cozy winter Movie Night at Marine Park Coffee. This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area. Everyone from southern Brooklyn is welcome to join, including those from Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Sunset Park, and beyond—we are proud to bring together people from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting the gathering and making the space available for a private community event.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

Please RSVP on Partiful so we can plan accordingly:

I told her to move them (a single colander in the sink and a single pot from boiling noodles on the stove), and she freaked out.

I came out a few minutes later to clean up and to ask her why she's slamming and stomping, and she completely ignored me. She didn't even cook. She said that's why she needed me to clean, though??

I can't help but feel unappreciated? I clean immediately after eating every. Single. Time. I'm quiet when she sleeps in until 2pm every day.

Scenario 2-Flirting at a coffee shop,but we end up being friends as he finds me fascinating rather than attractive. 

Scenario 3-Professor Graham:I have graduated top of the class and we are able to hang out now,we go out drinking and I overdo it and he takes care of me. 

I am 19 so will only rp with anyone 18+ and that’s the only requirement.I often stray from canon if I prefer a character another way,but we can stay within canon.I would only play Abigail for the scenarios without flirting of course.I generally prefer playing an OC rather than canon characters but we can discuss this.",1,1768185966.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False
1qaj5t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qaj5t7/other_options_than_a_dating_coach/,Other options than a dating Coach?,"Multiple therapists now have recommended a dating coach. I have investigated this idea and I don't know it seems like a scam. It's 3k - 10k and it doesn't fix my real problem of actually finding women I would be attracted to.  Getting better at dates with women I am really not all that interested in and definitely don't seem to be interested in me doesn't seem like a great idea.

Does anyone have any other ideas of a dating coach to ""get better"" at dating?

I am 44m, never had a ""real"" relationship with someone I have liked. Never have had someone I really really like , like me back.  I can go out and meet women, I have revamped my OLD profiles countless times and get likes but rarely, basically never, meet anyone I really can connect with. In the rare occasion, 3x in 25 years, I find someone who I can connect with who shows interest, they don't end up wanting a relationship with me. They like me, just never want a relationship with me.

I have been through 100s of dates, talked to 1000s of women. But just have no luck. It takes me time to really like someone, and I need to feel a real connection which means we really have to talk about life and experiences and goals and values, which I almost never get far enough to get a chance too. I am almost always told I am really nice and sweet and great on paper but there is no spark. Of course there is never going to be a spark we never got that far to have it.  I mean you can if open to it have a spark or interest almost immediately, but most women I meet are Soo walled off it would take me weeks or months to get to an actual connection with them.

I'm just tired of being alone. Most of my friends are dead , the few people who still are left are all married and prefer to hang out with other couples. I only wanted to have a family and kids, and never got a chance at that, and now I just want someone to share life with and it appears I will never get a chance at that either.  I'm tired of being isolated and alone and would love to find some way to find anyone I can actually connect with, but I think it's impossible. There aren't too many 40+ year old never married, no kids, non alcoholic, good job, good values people left at this age that someone else wouldn't have already taken.  A long distance relationship doesn't do anything for me really, and I have been on literally every app, every single event, 20+ different groups or clubs. Bars, gyms, events, coffee shops and there is just no one. Almost no one is single at this age, and the ones that are don't want a man. Continuing the course of being rejected 10x a week also doesn't seem like a great idea either.

So at this point I am just trying to find some hope to not fully give up. There just doesn't appear to be any paths left for me to find someone and I did everything I wanted to do already alone, so I have literally nothing left to live for unless I can ""solve dating"".",0,1768185962.0,dating_advice,2,0.33,False

She wants to know what would be a good projector to get; I've tried doing a little research but I'm just totally lost and think it'd be better to ask for advice here instead.

I've asked her what's her budget and she's said there wasn't one but the projectors she was looking at were around 2500-3000 AUD (around 1600-2000 USD). So far she's looked at the Hisense C2 and the XGIMI Horizon S Pro. I believe she wants Google TV built into the projector so she can watch her favorite K-Dramas on Netflix.

She plans to just project onto the white wall of her living+kitchen+dining room, which is 6.5 metres (around 21 ft) long. If you imagine it as a long vertical rectangle there are floor to ceiling windows at the back of the room and on the left, and she lives in Australia so I'm worried for brightness (though she does have blinds). She's just started moving in but she plans to have a couch against the window in the back, put the projector on a coffee table beside (the coffee table might have levels to put in as well) and project it onto the wall opposite. I've asked her for screen size and she's said she's fine with it being as big as the family's TV, which I think is like 80 inch max. I'm also confused because there's a kitchen island in the middle of the room so I'm not sure how she wants that to work. I don't believe she plans to have a separate sound system so the XGIMI is attractive for its Harman/Kardon speakers, however I also wonder if it'd be better to go with more known brands like Epson.  
  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, though if someone could point me to models to look at that would be even better because I'm not sure I'm experienced enough to process all the specs to make a decision. Thank you for reading!",3,1768185915.0,projectors,2,1.0,False
