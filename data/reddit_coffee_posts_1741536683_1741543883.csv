The kitchen table is buried under a pile of overdue bills: electricity, rent, medical debt, each one a reminder that she is drowning, working endlessly, yet never staying afloat. And in front of them sits a freshly poured cup of coffee, still steaming.

But she hasn’t touched it.

She just made it, but she’s too exhausted to even take a sip. Too drained from a 14-hour day of working, cleaning, parenting, barely holding it together. The coffee will go cold, just like her dreams, her time, her life.

In the background, the living room glows..not with warmth, but with the cold, artificial blue light of a screen. A child sits on the couch, eyes locked onto a tablet, raised by a device instead of their own mom. Not by choice, but because she’s always working. Working. 

She can hear the muffled sounds of the cartoon playing, the voices filling the silence between them. She should be there. She wants to be there. But her body is screaming for rest.

The lamp beside her flickers, glitching, just like her reality, breaking apart at the seams.

She works. She pays. She barely survives.

And tomorrow, she’ll do it all again.

This isn’t life. This is exhaustion disguised as existence.

They don’t want you to wake up.

But now, you see it.

So what will you do?

In this article, I’ll explore eight reasons why affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) is particularly suited for students.

# What is a Student Affiliate?

A college student who works as an affiliate marketer is a student affiliate. They are part-time [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) marketers who want to learn how to start an [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/) as a student.

Moreover, they engage in affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) programs and partnerships to promote big brands and small businesses’ products and services.

Student affiliates earn passive income through affiliate commissions for every sale they forward to their affiliate partner.

 These affiliates earn money [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) by choosing the best affiliate programs to support their university tuition and expenses.

# 8 reasons Why Affiliate Marketing is Best For Students.

Affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) offers students a flexible and profitable way to earn money while studying.

It’s not just about extra cash — it’s a gateway to developing skills that are valuable in today’s [digital](https://tchelete.com/effective-digital-marketing-strategy/) world.

Here are eight reasons why affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) is the perfect fit for students.

# 1. Flexibility to Fit Your Schedule.

As a student, managing time is a constant challenge. Affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) lets you work on your terms.

You can promote products or services whenever you have free time, whether it’s between classes or late at night. This flexibility means you can earn money without sacrificing your studies.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ American Time Use Survey (ATUS) states that college students have about 3–6 hours of free time daily.

 This means that you can work in between classes, during breaks, or even when you get home.

3–6 hours per day is enough to create a blog post or video that promotes your affiliate product.

Student affiliates can work in the cafeteria, a coffee shop, the library, or a nearby park.

# 2. Low Startup Costs.

Unlike other side gigs that might require a significant upfront investment, affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) requires minimal startup costs.

According to Jack Flynn’s article in Zippia, there are around 11,400 affiliate programs in the U.S. alone. Datanyze pushes this fact further by stating that 107,179 companies globally make up the affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) industry.

This proves that student affiliates can choose from any program they want and think is the most profitable. All of these affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) programs are free to join.

Affiliate networks like ShareASale, CJ Affiliate, and Awin have thousands of brand affiliate partners.

Correspondingly, affiliate programs such as eBay Partner Network and Shopify are some of the most popular.

Potential affiliates should also watch out for pay-to-join programs and other related scams.

All you need is a computer and an internet connection. There are no products to buy or inventory to manage, making it a low-risk way to start earning money [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/).

# 3. Potential for Passive Income.

Once you’ve set up your affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) channels — like a blog, [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/), or a [YouTube](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/) channel — you can start earning passive income.

# 4. Skill Development.

Affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) is not just about making money; it’s also a fantastic way to develop valuable skills.

You can learn practical skills like [digital marketing](https://tchelete.com/effective-digital-marketing-strategy/) and [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) management through affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/).

Moreover, being exposed to [content creation](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-content-creator-and-make-money/), website management, and keyword research will push you to master high-level skills such as email [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/), Search Engine Optimization ([SEO](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)), influencer [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/), and data analysis.

These valuable skills can help you during your university life or professional career.

[Online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) tools and [software](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-started-in-tech-with-no-experience/) like [Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/) Analytics, Yoast [SEO](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/), Mailchimp, and other [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) tools can help student affiliates expand their capabilities.

These are highly marketable skills that can boost your resume and make you more attractive to potential employers.

# 5. Networking Opportunities.

Getting into affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) often involves connecting with brands, other marketers, and even influencers.

These connections can open doors to future job opportunities or collaborations that you might not have encountered otherwise.

Networking in the affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) world can also lead to partnerships that are beneficial long after you’ve graduated.

# 6. No Need for Prior Experience.

You don’t need to be a [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) expert to start with affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/). There are plenty of resources available [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) to help you learn the ropes.

Many affiliate programs provide training and support to help you succeed. This makes it accessible for students of all backgrounds and majors.

# 7. Enhances Creativity.

Affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) gives you a platform to express your creativity. Whether you’re writing blog posts, creating videos, or designing [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) content, you can experiment with different formats and strategies.

This creative freedom can make affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) feel less like work and more like a fun, productive hobby.

# 8. Scalability.

One of the most appealing aspects of affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) is its scalability. As you grow your audience and learn what works, you can expand your efforts.

What starts as a small side hustle can turn into a significant source of income over time. This scalability allows you to continue earning as your needs and [goals](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-setting-strategic-goals-for-a-successful-life/) evolve

# 9. Students Will Gain Experience for Their Portfolio

An article by Pete Musto on the Voice of America (VOA) website featured a survey by the Adecco Group which unveiled that 74% of college graduates felt unprepared for real-world situations.

 This is where affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) is a big advantage. It helps student affiliates acquire high-level skills like content [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) and brand awareness strategies to help them be more confident and succeed in their chosen career.

Your affiliate [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) achievements are also a good addition to your professional portfolio.

Gaining positive and outstanding results on your Average Order Value (AOV), conversions, organic/search engine traffic performance, and sales volume contributes to how potential employers value you as a company asset.

And the only exercise I really get is when I'm chasing my littles around or dancing to Danny Go with them... that can be quite the workout when you're engaged in multiple videos in a row, lol. Also work full time, so a bit difficult to make the time, but I know I need to start.

Anyway, looking for some advice/recommendations on how to get to a healthier weight and maintain it. Thanks!",2,1741542479.0,diet,1,1.0,False
1j7d3rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1j7d3rl/black_sesame_pandan_oidfashioned/,Black Sesame Pandan OId-Fashioned,"A friend of mine bought some garam masala bitters and asked me to make something with them. Here's what I came up with: the black sesame pandan old-fashioned!

Black sesame and pandan both pair well with the garam masala, and both can work as savory or sweet flavors. Then, round out the drink with a savory, oak-forward rum. I use Mt. Gay Black Barrel; the aged El Dorado offerings would probably work here too, but I can't get them at liquor stores in Ohio.

**Black Sesame Pandan Old-Fashioned Recipe**

* 2oz Mt. Gay Black Barrel
* 1/4oz Black Sesame Pandan Syrup\*
* 2 dashes Garam Masala Bitters\*\*
* *Garnish*: Dehydrated lime wheel dipped in simple syrup and coated with sesame seeds

Stir all ingredients over ice and strain into a double rocks glass with a large clear ice cube. Garnish with the sesame-coated dehydrated lime wheel.

One note about the bitters: we ran out of the small bottle my friend bought while testing the recipe, so we tried making our own. That recipe follows. The homemade bitters were much spicier, but otherwise similar in flavor.

**Black Sesame Pandan Syrup Recipe\***

* 65g Water
* 32.5g Coconut Sugar
* 81g Sugar
* 1tsp (\~2.22g) Black Sesame Seeds
* 1 Pandan Leaf, loosely torn into pieces

Combine ingredients in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently. Once sugar is completely dissolved, remove from heat, cover the saucepan, and leave overnight. Strain.

**Garam Masala Bitters Recipe\*\***

* 2.5oz Vodka, 110-proof
* 2tsp Garam Masala Powder
* A Pinch of Coconut Sugar
* A Pinch of Cherry Wood Chips

Combine the ingredients in a mason jar. Stir, seal, and leave in a cool, dark place overnight. Strain through a coffee filter and transfer to a dasher bottle.

You may have to adjust this recipe based on the garam masala you use. Mine turned out very spicy.",3,1741542439.0,cocktails,1,1.0,False

It would just be myself (29M) and whoever fills this room (I can't do more than one roommate, since the kitchen becomes a huge hassle 😭).

Some info about the apartment:

10 minutes from Manhattan via the 7 train (only one stop away from Grand Central), access to two Ferries, parking garage, bike storage and tons of Citibike racks nearby!

The apartment includes:

- In Unit Washer/Dryer
- Floor to Ceiling Windows
- AC/Heating Unit in every room
- Dishwasher and Food Disposal
- Keurig if you love quick coffee!
- Big Ol' Pikachu 

The bedroom itself

- It looks tight, but can comfortably fit a full and can fit a queen with some room to spare if you'd like
- Has a closet with a good amount of space

Other things that are good to know:

- Other bedroom is currently being used as an office, and there are two desk (one being my own), so if you WFH and want to have a bright room to work in, you can do it in here!
- Amenities are **included**, which includes gym access, garden access, rooftop access and lounge access. There is also another Laundromat on the building, if you wanted to use that instead

About me:

I'm in the fitness industry (again 29M), but also have freelance coding side projects occasionally. I typically have long days and start early, come home midday and head back out again in the afternoon. I'm also a bit of an influencer, so if you want to see my Instagram, you can dm me and I can send you that info! (I just don't want to post it publicly on reddit 😭).
You can see from my post history that I am a bit of a nerd and I like to mod games/code games as a hobby. 

I'm open to either a male or female roommate, but I'd *really* like someone who knows how to keep a kitchen clean (issue with current roommate). Generally when I'm home, I tend to not be super talkative (yelling at clients all day will do that to you) but I'd like to say I'm friendly (though I may be biased)! Also, the building itself is smoke free, so if you need to do it, it can't be inside the apartment.

Short term (between 1-3 months) preferred, but will consider Long term (over 6 months) for the right person!

Rent: **$1800** + Electric Bill for the month

Electric Bill should not hit more than $100 a month, except in the summer where everyone is blasting the AC.

I cover the cost of the monthly Internet and Amenity fees, as well as the maintenance/cleaning fees, so you don't have to worry about that!

Also, I apologize for the pic of the bedroom, as I said the current occupant is REALLY messy, and didn't want to many photos, but I can organize a tour or a video tour if that works for you. I'm not the *greatest* photo taker, but the apartment is actually quite large.

Anyway, I hope everyone has a great day! =)",2,1741542191.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False
1j7czdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j7czdg/aitah_for_avoiding_my_godchild_whose_mum_has/,AITAH for avoiding my godchild whose mum has turned into a mombie,"Dear Reddit community,
This is my first post about a topic that has been bothering me for almost two years now.

I am female, 30 years old and CF and I am godmother to a little girl (lets call her Sandy). Her mum (lets call her Tina) is one of my closest friends. I was really happy to be the girl's godmother, because I was looking forward to playing an official part in this little human's life and also because to me this was a sign of trust from Tina's side which honoured me. That being said, neither Tina nor myself are very religious. In our culture, godparents usually show up for birthdays and other big occasions and bring presents. I never had a close bond with my godmother myself (my mum's best friend).

I have to mention that Tina is a super dominant person. Always has been.
So the first times I came over the visits were very baby-focused, which for me was totally OK as I thought it to be normal in the beginning. Then it started to annoy me that whenever I come over, Sandy is always the complete center of attention - there are no real adult conversations anymore -, her parents automatically assume that I will go off and play with Sandy, also nudging me to do so if I don't. My task is considered to be entertaining Sandy whenever I am there. Once Tina requested my BF and me to get up from our coffees in order to go play with Sandy, which we didn't do and which left Tina startled. But usually during the visits I end up playing with Sandy while my BF chats with Tina and her husband. Or we all sit together, playing with Sandy.
A few things also seem quite weird to me, e.g. Tina always pushes me to go through the latest Sandy photo albums when I am there; the last two years she's also given me family calendars (Tina, her husband + Sandy) and Sandy pictures as Christmas presents; and one time when Sandy was finally in bed, we all sat at the dinner table and Tina put up the baby cam, suggesting to me that we watch Sandy sleep.

I was looking forward to being Sandy's godmother, I really was, but I am starting to get really, really annoyed.
In the beginning I enjoyed going there as well as bringing Sandy presents but I also realised that these presents are not appreciated at all (even though Tina explicitly ecnourages me to get specific stuff), because Sandy already has everything as her parents are financially very well off.

I have a bad conscience because as a godmother I feel an obligation to love spending time with Sandy which I do not. I don't have a particular bond with the child which might be due to the fact that I feel really pushed by her parents. I have well realized that, for them, being a godmother involves 110% dedication to their child which to me feels overwhelming and unnatural.
But the thing that really saddens me is that Tina and I do not have what I consider a normal, adult friendship anymore - Sandy is our bond now.

Why have I not addressed this so far? I find it really, really hard, especially with Tina being so dominant and also considering the fact that I am the godmother (who is supposed to be loving all this), to say that I do not like this whole Sandy circus all the freaking time (ofc there's nicer ways to put this). I know that the issue is that I miss Tina's and my old friendship and that I could simply tell Tina that. But that wouldn't change anything right now because she'll have her 2nd baby in a few weeks, which will make arranging for ""girls time"" even more difficult.

What I have been doing for now is withdraw. I have not gone to see them in months. The last two years I have been making all the trips (they live one hour away by car).
I do not really have a solution in mind that will not upset Tina.

I would be really happy to read your thoughts on this.
Have you ever been in a simular situation (esp. as a godmother)? How did you deal with it?

1j7cyz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1j7cyz4/wibta_for_leaving_my_current_living_situation/,WIBTA for Leaving My Current Living Situation,"*Background*

A couple of months ago my fiancé and I moved into an old 30ft trailer. I'm pregnant by him and have a barely toddler aged child by another man. When we moved in, he was coming from a homeless shelter and I had to leave my original place due to a rent spike. To put it into perspective: we were stressed and crash landing into a cheap place. The problem with said trailer is it doesn't currently have a hot water heater in it, propane hooked up, or hoses hooked up for running water. While the hosing for the propane needs to be replaced, the integegrity of all other hookups are possible and awaiting to be made whole. It also has two busted windows that allow for small (but not insignificant) amounts of water to leak into the floor and cause black mold in the living room area. We've already had the floors, ""done"" as in sheets of wood were nailed down over the molding wood floors. Lastly, the entire bathroom floor is rotted out because this trailer has been in storage for the past year with a leak in the bathroom vent cover. It also requires a new toilet. 

There is a newly, and nicely, renovated bathroom at the rv park (25 cents = 1 minute and 15 seconds of hot water for showers), a laundry facility (about $5 a load in total), a water spigot behind my trailer, and we have power. My stove is a hot plate but I have a single burner propane camping stove in case of emergencies. We have no furniture except for a bed and we use pillows and blankets for couches and chairs. My daughter has her stuff but I don't count her furniture as it's a little...lacking for the average adult to use. 

If I want to pee without dealing with weather I have to pee in a coffee can (can't afford a camping toilet) and hold my number 2s until the weather is right or my fiancé will watch my daughter so I don't have to walk her to the bathroom and then hear her scream because it's cold and echoey. If I want to do dishes I'm taking jugs of water inside and microwaving cups of water or using the stove top for hot water. I can only afford a shower once a month because I physically can't shower fast with long hair, only getting to once in awhile, and having to bathe my daughter. I wash my hair in the rv park sink occasionally but it hurts my back to be bent over and 6 months pregnant while my kiddo yells into the bathroom abyss. 

*Now:*

I'm over living with my daughter in a fancy shed. I am okay pulling this stunt alone; I lived pretty poor growing up and  was excited by the thought of renovating the trailer. My issue comes in from having lived in this place from November of last year until now and still not even having running water. My fiancé was supposed to coordinate with the previous owner to aquire EVERYTHING we need for the plumbing including the tools to affix everything. I told him to take a month off because he had been homeless for months prior to moving into said trailer and then he needed to fix it up because I was getting to the point that I was too pregnant to be working on said projects. He has insisted he would get to it and makes excuses like, ""I don't even have a hammer,"" (no s**t, that's why we are being provided the tools), ""I can't get a hot water heater on the bus!"" (We just need to make a call to ask for our friend to have it all delivered). Every time I point this stuff out he flips out and shuts me down saying things like, ""Well I guess I'm just a POS then!"" 

The thing is, I didn't sign up for this. He told me he'd get this trailer in order by the time I gave birth and I'm already a week shy of 7 months. This baby wants to come early and I need to have a c-section no matter what. I cannot heal up from surgery in this kind of environment. I cannot have a new baby around this stuff. I need to bathe more than once a month! 

I have the opportunity tomorrow to be placed into a shelter of sorts with my daughter. Everyone gets their own room that locks, and single mothers share the apartment unit with another single mother and their child. I'd be there for 30 days while they place me in a more permanent low income housing. WIBTA if I went? WIBTA if they me housing in town I and took it instead of returning to the trailer if it doesnt get fixed by the time my shelter time is up? I have tried bringing this up as a temporary option while he sets the place up to my fiancé twice before and both times he freaked out saying he's done a ton of work in here and it's not just a shed. That I'm invalidating all the love that he and others (initial clean up and nailing the floors) have put into it. I don't think I am: I think I just want better for myself and my daughter. 

I feel like IATAH and I don't look forward to doing this. I know my phone will be plagued with hateful phone calls and texts when I leave, possibly even self-delete or ""arm reconstruction"" threats on my phone. I don't want to be hated for doing what I think is right.

1j7cxq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/realtors/comments/1j7cxq1/need_diy_home_staging_tips/,Need: DIY Home Staging Tips,"Hi there!

I’ve been practicing real estate for about a year now. I’ve been relatively successful considering the market; however, definitely not a top producer by any means. Most of my listings have been homes in the $250k range - my market is a resort area, so average home price is closer to $500k. I share this for reference and context. 

Anywho - I just landed my biggest listing yet! Yay me! Haha. Our asking price is $600k and we go live in just over a week. I really want to knock it out of the park with presentation and marketing. I’m ballin’ on a budget, so I will be staging the property myself and getting it prepared for photos. 

I have a housekeeper and carpet cleaners coming this week, so I’ve got that covered. I just need some help with staging, as I’ve only done it once before with a nightly rental property that was newly furnished at the time. 

The home is vacant and the owners left a bit of furniture for me to work with (bed, dressers, couch & chair, dining table, night stands, etc.).  Everything else has been removed, thankfully! So no clutter or personal items. The home and furniture are a bit dated (not a huge deal), so I want focal points to be things such as the natural light, vaulted ceilings, large rooms and closets, great open living spaces and kitchen, etc. 

Here’s what I’ve got so far: 

- I purchased standard white plates with silver chargers and white place mats so I can set the table and I’ve got wine glasses to set with it. 

-I purchased two white ceramic coffee mugs to set on the breakfast bar. 

- I’ll be using a white duvet insert for the bed in the primary bedroom. 

- I purchased 2 pretty gold and mirrored pictured frames to set on a dresser or nightstand.

- I purchased a nice throw blanket for the couch in the living room.

- I have a few nice vases that I plan on getting fake flowers for.

- I have a fruit basket and plan on getting fake fruit to put in it.

- I have a couple of nice candle holders I can place on a counter or dresser or something. 

Here’s what I plan on purchasing:

- standard white towels for each of the bathrooms. 

- a couple of small table lamps to put on the night stands in the primary bedroom.

- throw pillows for the living room couch.


What else would you recommend? I’ve got a $100 budget for the remaining items and any other additional items. I know, not a lot to work with, but again… I’m a newer realtor who’s got a pretty tight budget at the moment. Whatever I purchase I’d either like to repurpose in my own home or save for future staging purposes. I plan on visiting the local humane society thrift store tomorrow to see if I find anything that jumps out at me. (I live and work in a small community of ~9000 people so marketplace and thrift stores are very limited)

Additionally, any tips for staging? I’ve done plenty of research, but would love to hear what’s worked for you! Thank you!

It was a Friday night and the office was dead silent. Everyone had clocked out hours ago but Jake and I were stuck finishing some bullshit project due Monday. The breakroom was our little hideout with its shitty flickering light and the low buzz of the fridge. Jake is this hot as fuck guy—tall, ripped, dark hair and these piercing blue eyes that always eye-fucked me when he thought I wasn’t looking.

We were both beat but there was this thick vibe between us like static ready to spark. I broke the quiet. “So Jake any plans for the weekend?” He glanced up from his laptop with this cocky smirk. “Nah just wanna chill. You?” I shrugged. “Same. Maybe we could chill together?” I tossed it out casual but his eyes got this hungry glint.

I reached for a coffee mug and my hand grazed his arm. That little touch hit me like a shockwave and I saw it hit him too. He stepped in close and put his hand on my waist. It was firm and warm and my whole body buzzed. I leaned into him and our mouths crashed together hard and sloppy.

His lips were hot and greedy and his tongue fucked mine like he owned it. His hands roamed all over me—grabbing my ass and yanking me against him. I felt his cock rock hard through his pants and my pussy was already soaking. I had on this tight pencil skirt that hugged my ass and a blouse that barely hid my tits and Jake was all over it.

He shoved his hands under my skirt and traced the edge of my panties. “Fuck you’re drenched” he growled against my mouth and I moaned loud. He pushed my panties aside and started rubbing my clit fast and rough. My hips jerked and I was panting like a bitch in heat.

Then he dropped down and hiked my skirt up. He yanked my panties to my ankles and shoved his face in my cunt. His tongue went straight for my clit licking and sucking like he was starving for it. I’d fingered myself thinking about Jake plenty of times but this was next level. The air conditioner kicked on and I flinched thinking someone might catch us but that just made my pussy drip more.

“Oh fuck Jake I’m gonna cum” I whined and he sucked harder till I exploded all over his face. My legs shook and I gripped the table to stay up.

He stood up with my juices dripping off his chin and kissed me again. I tasted my own cum on his tongue and it made me fucking feral. He unzipped his pants and pulled out his cock—thick and long with veins bulging like it was begging to fuck me. I licked my lips ready to take it all.

He hoisted me onto the breakroom table and spread my legs wide. He teased my slit with the head of his cock rubbing it over my clit till I was squirming. Then he pushed in slow and deep stretching my pussy till I felt every inch. I locked my legs around him and pulled him in tighter.

He started pounding me deep and hard. The table rocked and squeaked and our bodies slapped together loud as fuck. The room stank of sweat and sex and my juices were running down my thighs. “Fuck your cunt’s so tight” he snarled gripping my hips bruising hard. “You love getting fucked like a dirty slut right here don’t you?”

“Yes fuck yes I love it” I gasped clawing at his shoulders. “Fuck me harder Jake. Own my pussy.”

He slammed into me even rougher and I felt my orgasm building fast. My pussy squeezed his cock tight. “I’m gonna cum again” I screamed and he rubbed my clit sending me crashing over the edge. I came so hard I saw stars and my pussy milked him like a vice.

He groaned loud and thrust deep unloading his cum inside me. It was hot and thick and flooded my pussy till I felt it in my guts. He kept pumping till he was dry then pulled out slow. His cum leaked out of me dripping down my thighs and pooling on the table.

I was a fucked-out mess but it was the hottest shit ever. We grabbed some paper towels and wiped up quick hoping no one would smell the sex in the air. As we walked out Jake leaned in close. “We gotta do this again.” I grinned already wet thinking about next time.",59,1741541964.0,confessions,16,0.65,False

I'm a tiny enterprise with one other staff member. 

This person was originally employed 9 months ago to look after clients (tea, coffee , cleaning etc)

A month ago I decided they were costing my business too much, so I let them go,  after 8 months of employment.  

2 weeks later I received a 'formal grievance' from them with all this unhinged stuff about me illegally dismissing them, breaking health and safety laws, not paying them enough holidays and wages blah blah blah...  not true.  I even gave them 2 weeks notice pay, when legally,  I'm only required to pay one. I did it as a goodwill gesture.  

They even threw in finding pornographic websites on the company laptop and having photographic evidence and the best way to settle this was to pay them compensation for all the stress caused and how over the last few months I would have noticed the significant amount of weight they had lost due to the stress of working for my company. (They spent many hours sitting and scrolling on their phone and I even caught them sitting drinking tea and reading a book , not long after taking an hour lunch break) at that point I felt like a complete fool for paying them £12 ph while I was working my ass off. 

Due to the blackmailing nature of the email,  I decided to hire an employment lawyer to respond on behalf of my company and explain to them that not only are their claims invalid,  but made up on some AI generator.  

Unfortunately, they're still keen to get in touch with ACAS and escalate this to early conciliation (even though they literally have nothing solid) 

They're now claiming that I was ""consistently disrespectful and unprofessional "" I also didn't inform them that their job would involve cleaning (not true) I have a record of this thank god. 

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this?

I'm finding it unbelievably stressful and hard to concentrate on anything else. 

They have now started emailing my lawyer trying to make friends and have been telling them that if they don't get what they want,  they will go to the media or online to post about  their experiences working for my company. 

No issues were ever brought up until  after their dismissal.

I always knew I should do so but never really knew what that encompassed. Here is my best advice as someone who has dealt with various repro issues including endo (and obviously you do what YOU need to do for YOUR health :)) Many of us know these, but for lurkers here who may have symptoms but no formal diagnosis or may be struggling with their diagnosis, this is for that:

1. Get more than one or two opinions. If you experience pain that you think could be endometriosis or even reproductive pain in general and feel dismissed, seek out other healthcare offices, providers, and backgrounds (MD, PA, NP). Before I had my lap, I remember hearing “most girls your age have pain and we’ll never find an issue” by a male medical professional. That was four years ago and I’ve had probably six or seven MDs since then due to moving and finding one best for me. Additionally, ask your current OB/GYN if it may be possible to see a specialist who works directly with underlying conditions such as endo. When I finally found my specialist and new medication, I cried in joy.

2. Know that you are valid. Your pain is valid. Your experience is valid. Myself and many other women and professionals believe you when you say that you have tried everything, that you are in agony each month, that the pain is unbearable, etc. Even if one doctor doesn’t believe you, your experience matters. It is not in your head, it is in your reproductive system. Even without a diagnosis yet, your experience matters. Endo is difficult to diagnose because of lack of research and ability to see it on scans. Sometimes MRIs or CTs pick it up, other times it is seen only during a lap or an excision. Any amount of endometriosis, no matter the stage, can be debilitating. There have been cases of stage one where people couldn’t physically move each month and cases of stage four where patients were up and moving about. It is very personal. 

3. Keep a list of everything you’ve tried for your pain, especially if you don’t have a diagnosis yet as it helps tell professionals to avoid comments such as “have you tried Tylenol and a hot bath” (ugh). Write down any medications (NSAIDs, specialty drugs, birth controls), holistic methods (hot packs, CBD lotion, TENs machine, acupuncture, etc) and alternative options (diet changes, exercise changes, etc) you have tried as an example of your experience. I know we’re sick of the common “just take birth control” or “take NSAIDs around the clock” or “have you cut out wheat”

4. Find community online or in physical circles with women/people with endo who can relate to you and understand you so you don’t feel isolated. When I brought up my endo, I was shocked how many other women also had experienced endometriosis and realized how swept under the rug it is. Mentally block people who are ignorant or offer uneducated advice or snide remarks.

5. Research! You are your best advocate because only you live in your body! Look up specialists, specialty medications, surgical procedures, etc all in advance. Listen to stories of others who have experienced your symptoms and may have tips on how to advocate for yourself. Don’t be embarrassed to be open and honest even when met with questioning because YOU know how it feels in YOUR body. Our bodies are fascinating, they will tell us when something is not right. It is NOT normal to have constant spotting, heavy clotting, pain so bad you wish to evaporate or have to consistently miss work. 

6. Most of all, give yourself love and grace. Care for yourself because you matter. Take the hot baths and order the coffee. Go on a nature walk, look up at the stars, journal, buy yourself dinner, treat yourself to a cute outfit. It’s an invisible burden to have debilitating health struggles and you deserve it!

When police arrived the next morning, Drew's story was that he got home the morning of the 28th, after his shift, and briefly talked to Stacy. She told him she was visiting her father later in the morning. When he woke about 10, she was gone. He called off work for that night to use up some of his sick time prior to retirement. The day was spent at home and doing errands. At 9 p.m., Stacy had called him to say she was leaving with another man, and her car was at Clow Airport (small airfield near the Petersons' house). He went out searching for her, returning about 11 p.m. Later he walked to Clow Airport to pick up her car. Police searched the house and Drew's car, but he would not let them search Stacy's car.  

On Oct. 30, Thomas Morphey came into the picture. Thomas was Drew's step-brother. He suffered from bipolar disorder and alcoholism. He was usually hard-up and Drew had frequently helped him with money and gotten him jobs. On this day, police had a visit from Walter Martinek and Sheryl Alcox. Sheryl was Thomas's partner; Walter was a friend of Thomas. They told police that Thomas had a story about helping Drew to move what he thought might be Stacy's body from his house to his car. Thomas, in remorse, had overdosed on pills and alcohol, and was currently in the hospital. 

Thomas was interviewed by Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, and offered immunity for his testimony. Here is Thomas's story:  

On Oct. 27, Thomas got a call from Drew asking to meet. They went to a local park, and Drew told Thomas that Stacy was cheating on him, and he had to take care of it.  He asked if Thomas loved him enough to kill for him. Thomas said he couldn't live with himself. He then asked if Thomas could live with knowing about it. Thomas said yes. They went to a storage facility and Thomas was to rent a unit. But he didn't have ID on him, so they had to go home. Later, Thomas called Drew and said he couldn't be involved in whatever Drew was planning.  

On Oct. 28, Drew took Thomas for coffee (caught on camera) and to a park, where he asked Thomas to hold his phone and wait. He said not to answer the phone no matter what. Then he left. The phone rang around 9 p.m. with “Stacy Cell” on the caller ID. Drew was gone for about two hours, and then asked Thomas to help him move something out of the house. They went to the Petersons' bedroom and picked up a large container. Most accounts say it was a blue plastic barrel, but contemporary newspaper accounts say it was a rectangular container. They moved it from the house to Drew's SUV. Thomas said it weighed about 120 pounds and was warm to the touch. Drew gave Thomas cash and told him “This never happened.” 

Afterward, Thomas had qualms. He went to see his friend Walter and blurted out that he may have just helped dispose of Stacy's body. He had been drinking heavily and continued drinking at home.
On the 29th, he called Drew and said he wanted to hang himself.  Later that night, he started drinking again and took several Xanax. He overdosed and woke up in the hospital. 

When police next visited the Peterson residence on Nov. 1, they had warrants for the house and both cars. They took computers and 11 guns from the house. In even worse news for Drew, Stacy's disappearance had caused the State's Attorney's office to reopen the Kathleen Savio case.  At a grand jury convened Nov. 7, Drew took the fifth amendment. Two days later, police named him as a suspect in Stacy's disappearance. Around this time, Rev. Neil Schori also spoke to police about what Stacy had told him about Kathleen Savio's death.  

Drew resigned from the Bolingbrook Police on Nov. 12, thus avoiding an internal affairs investigation unrelated to Stacy's disappearance. In a few weeks, he would have reached his thirtieth anniversary. 

Kathleen's family were overjoyed that Kathleen's case would be reviewed. Her remains were exhumed on Nov. 13. The family hired Dr. Michael Baden, renowned New York medical examiner, to perform an autopsy. Both his and the state's medical examiner agreed that the cause of death was drowning during a struggle, manner of death homicide. 

Meanwhile searches had been going on for Stacy. Texas EquuSearch, national search company was involved, and the FBI joined the search by the end of November. One area police targeted was the Sanitary and Ship Canal around Romeoville (town south of Bolingbrook). One reason for this was that Scott Rossetto lived nearby, and Stacy's phone had pinged in the area on Oct. 28. Police reasoned that Drew might have disposed of the body near Scott's residence to throw suspicion on him. Police searched the ground around the canal, also using aerial photography and dogs. They searched the canal waters using hi-res camera equipment,  but they didn't find any remains. Inspite of many volunteers, none of the searches turned up anything. Drew continued to maintain that Stacy had left and was in Jamaica or somewhere similar. Friends and family didn't believe this. First, because some of them knew about his threats to Stacy. Second, because they said she would never have left the children. And last, because they couldn't believe that possessive, jealous Drew Peterson would be so nonchalant about Stacy leaving him for another man. 

The story of a cop whose young wife had disappeared, and whose previous wife had died in suspicious circumstances, soon went national. Media descended on Peterson's house, at first to his dismay. He sent the children to stay with his family. After that, he started to bask in the media attention, making wisecracks and talking to anyone with a microphone. One interviewer, Shepard Smith, got him riled by asking about neighbors seeing him carrying a barrel out of his house. The interview was quickly cut short. 

Drew appeared on television programs like Larry King Live and The Today Show, where he put out a call for a defense lawyer. The call was answered by Chicago attorney Joel Brodsky, a publicity hound to rival Drew. The two made the rounds of TV and radio shows. Drew maintained his innocence and said things like Stacy wanted to divorce him every month based on her menstrual cycle. He said she always liked the attention of men. His callous attitude had its peak when he and Brodsky called in to a Chicago radio show and a Dating Game segment was proposed. Apparently a segment was actually recorded, with Drew asking the contestants questions like “Do you take baths or showers?” Fortunately for all, higher-ups at the station put a stop to the segment.  

The fun and games came to an end on May 7, 2009, when Drew was arrested and charged with the murder of Kathleen Savio. He pleaded not guilty. His bail was set at $20 million. 

In 2008 a new law was passed by the Illinois legislature, which was nicknamed “Drew's Law.” Essentially it allowed the introduction of hearsay testimony into evidence if it could be proved that the defendant killed the witness to prevent them from testifying. This would allow statements from Kathleen and Stacy to be admissible. Since the case against Drew was circumstantial, their words would have significantly affected the strength of the prosecution case. A mini-trial was held before the actual trial to determine which statements would be admissible. Drew's lawyers tried to get this hearing closed, but the judge ruled that it would be open to the public. Among the witnesses who testified at this hering and not at the full trial were Vicki Connolly, Thomas Morphew, and Sharon Bychowski. Sharon tearfully told of finding Stacy crying out in front of the house after she had told Drew she was divorcing him. She told Stacy to write down all the things she was telling Sharon about Drew. Stacy replied, “It doesn't matter. He'll kill me. I'm already dead.” The statements were ruled inadmissible, and the prosecution took their case to the Illinois Supreme Court, which ordered the lower court to reconsider allowing 8 out of 14 statements. The Appellate Court reverses their decision on 8 statements. These procedures as well as other filings occupied most of 2010 and 2011. Trial was set for July 23, 2012, and opening arguments started on July 31 before a jury of 7 men and 5 women.

Among the witnesses at trial were the divorce attorney whom Stacy had consulted, two of Drew's sons, Kathleen's sister, Rev. Schori, and Jeff Pachter, who worked with Drew at a cable company. Jeff testified that Drew had offered him $25,000 to find someone to “take care of” Kathleen. Jeff thought he was joking.  Months later, Drew told him he didn't need that job done. Drew himself never took the stand. 	

The jury started deliberations on Sept. 5, and on Sept. 6, Drew was found guilty of first degree murder. He was later sentenced to 38 years in prison and would be eligible for parole in 2047. Allowed to speak to the court, Drew made a statement ending with a loud outburst of “I did not kill Kathleen!”  

He was sent to Menard Correctional Center in downstate Chester, Illinois. While there, in 2014, Drew got friendly with another inmate, a former gang member, and offered him $10,000 to arrange a hit on State's Attorney James Glasgow. The inmate went to the police and made a deal to wear a wire. Peterson made incriminating statements that were caught on wire, including how if he could get booze into the prison, they'd celebrate when the hit was brought off.  He was charged and ultimately convicted of solicitation of murder for hire. It took the jury only an hour to reach a verdict. This added 40 years to his sentence, to be served consecutively.  

Drew's team filed for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel and conflict of interest by his attorney Brodsky. It was denied. In 2014, his defense filed an appeal. The conviction was upheld at the Appellate and State Supreme Court levels. However, he has still not given up. As of 2024, he is seeking a new trial on grounds that his attorney did not allow him to speak in his own defense.  

Drew's son Stephen, who suffered from anxiety and substance abuse problems after losing his law enforcement job for accepting firearms and $200,000 from his father during the investigation, moved into the Bolingbrook house and has raised the Peterson childen. Stephen staunchly defended Drew for a long time, but has stated that he believes his father probably killed both Kathleen and Stacy.  

“Drew's Law” was repealed. Jurors said the hearsay statements, especially from the divorce lawyer, were a major factor in arriving at a guilty verdict.  

After all this, Stacy's body has never been found, and although she is presumed dead, no one has been charged with her murder. Her sister Cassandra has not given up. Cassandra feels the police searches of the canal were done poorly. She believes she found a full body at the bottom of the canal within weeks of Stacy's disappearance, and has followed its course as it move down the channel.  In 2021, she said she found what looks to be a skull. Police were informed, but they waited 5 months before performing another search with sonar and hi-res cameras. They said the area was clear and the only thing found was a rock. Cassandra made a public statement about this in 2024. She is trying to raise funds to have divers perform a search using a hand-held sonar HD device, but the cost is over $100,000 for equipment rental and training of the dive team. She says she is not giving up. As she says, if it is not Stacy, it is someone else who deserves to get their identity back. [Photo of the canal bed where alleged skull was seen; may be disturbing](https://www.courttv.com/news/stacy-petersons-sister-believes-her-remains-have-been-found/)  

In 2022, Drew's former layer Joel Brodsky gave an interview where he hinted that he might tell what he knows about Stacy.  
“I know everything about both of his wives – everything,” Brodsky said. “I feel bad about Drew still not taking responsibility and Stacy still being missing.  I’m thinking about maybe revealing what happened to Stacy and where she is.”  

Brodsky was not practicing at the time and had come off a two-year suspension of his law license, which he felt was unfair. The judge from his initial trial ordered him not to reveal anything, but he suggested he might continue to pursue the option. In 2024, he was charged with violating the gag order during an interview on NewsNation.    

Like most people, I believe Stacy is dead. She would have contacted someone if she were still alive. Sightings were reported in the early years – she was seen in Peoria, in Thailand. None were reliable reports. It is almost certain that Drew is responsible for Stacy's disappearance. He had means, motive, and opportunity. Besides the machismo of not wanting to let Stacy leave him, she knew he had killed Kathleen. No one else who was suspected had any real motive. But he is not confessing anything. He says he wouldn't want his children to think he killed their mothers. He says Stacy ran away just like her mother did. Finding Stacy's body would be of material help in building a case against him. Even though Drew Peterson isn't ever getting out of jail, and an additional sentence wouldn't change his circumstances, Stacy deserves justice, and her family deserve to lay her to rest.

Settle a debate for me and my husband: in a two parent household when one parent is traveling, who coordinates the childcare, drop offs, etc. for the disruption in schedule - the traveling parent or non-traveling parent? 

My opinion is that the non-traveling parent should be coordinating this. The person traveling doesn’t know if the non-traveling person can leave work early, go in late, take a day off, etc. Plus they likely already have a lot of planning to do for the trip itself so it would be nice for the other parent to step up and help. 

My husband has the view that the person traveling should do it - they are leaving so it’s their responsibility to figure out the job they are normally responsible for whether that’s drop off, pick up, etc. 

I have a trip coming up soon (personal, not work) from Friday - Sunday so I’m taking Friday off work. I’m in the US but it’s an international trip so there’s that extra added consideration of traveling international. I work remote so normally on Fridays I take my son to a childcare coffee shop place near us while I work in the cafe and he plays in the play area. My husband says I should be figuring out something else since I will be gone, but I said it should be him to coordinate since I don’t know his work schedule and if he can/will take a day off, work remote, or if he needs to figure something else out.  

Ultimately I do think it should be a conversation between both parents to figure out. I did tell my husband about this trip months ago and we put it on the calendar and he didn’t give it a second thought about it until now

All that to say I’m curious, how do other people handle solo travel and the coordinating that comes with it? ",5,1741541194.0,workingmoms,30,0.78,False

I’m a 29-year-old guy standing at the intersection of “What am I doing with my life?” and “Maybe this is exactly where I’m supposed to be.” If you’ve ever felt the same, let’s talk.  

I’m not here with a checklist or a rigid plan. Life doesn’t come with a manual, and neither do connections. So, let’s skip the formalities and start with a conversation. Who knows? Maybe we’ll write a story worth telling.  

### Here’s a glimpse of my chapter so far:  
- **Music:** My playlist is a mix of soulful, introspective, and eclectic tracks. Lately, I’ve been looping songs like *New Magic Wand - Tyler The Creator*, *The weekend - Open hearts*, and *Diamond Boy - SZA*. If music is your language, we’ll vibe.  
- **Health:** 2023 was a wake-up call. I’ve been hitting the gym, eating clean, and prioritizing sleep. But I also believe in balance—getting high once in a while to just *be*.  
- **Hobbies:** Cooking is my therapy (I make a mean chilli garlic noodles), coffee is my love language (dark roast, no sugar), and art is my escape (psychedelic art speaks to my soul).  
- **Humor:** Dark, witty, and a little awkward. If you can laugh at existential dread, we’re already friends.  
- **Travel:** Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my happy place. Bonus if you’re into deep conversations under the stars.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A kind, nurturing soul who’s okay with my occasional silences (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A connection that feels natural, where we can talk about everything and nothing.  
- Bonus if you’re an Arsenal fan (I need emotional support) or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

### Why you should DM me:  
- If you’ve ever wanted to talk about life’s big questions over coffee. 
- If you’re looking for someone who’ll listen, laugh, and maybe even write you a terrible poem.  
- If you’re curious about where this could go—no pressure, just possibilities.  

Let’s start with a “hi” and see where the story takes us. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something beautiful.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already my kind of person. Don’t overthink it—just say hello. 😊

I’ve got the pricing details sorted out (pasted below), but I’m stuck on how to turn it into a functional, nice-looking site—think HTML/CSS or maybe a free platform suggestion?I’m not a pro coder or designer yet—more of a hustler trying to figure this out as I go. If anyone’s a student, beginner dev, or just enjoys tinkering with projects like this, I’d love some advice or hands-on help. Maybe we could even make it a fun group thing—like a mini portfolio piece for anyone involved? No pressure, just throwing it out there!Here’s the pricing I’m working with:1.

I’m on 70mg elvanse. Have been for nearly 2 years. But more so recently I’ve just been feeling meh. Like, I work shifts, 2 weeks of early shift, 2 weeks of late shift. So the times I take it changes so I get the impact at work - which in recent months, I don’t seem to be getting quite the affect or umph I’m used to getting - so with that in mind my coffee intake has been CRAZY! Which more than likely isn’t helping. 
But anyway, I’m a mum to a 2 year old, me and my wife work opposite shifts for child care. And I just want to *show up* for my family. But I’m constantly moody recently and it’s not the best look. 
I’ve read some comments on here where people are on other meds aswell as elvanse? Didn’t even know that was an option?

I've been crying and feeling suicidal, especially every Sunday night and Monday morning","I don’t hate my job, but I REALLY hate going to the office. Every WFO day, I have a meltdown, feel suicidal, and sometimes cry before or during work. My coworkers have caught me crying multiple times.  

I struggle with extreme task paralysis. ""Future rewards"" don’t motivate me because it’s not immediate. The future is the future, and I can only live in the here and now. 

The night before WFO, I can’t sleep, even with meds or calming sounds, and always end up sleep-deprived.  

I can’t tolerate rigid routines, long hours, or BEING TRAPPED AT A DESK ALL DAY. The office environment is overwhelming—too many people, noise, movement, and overstimulation from constant interaction. The commute is exhausting too. Compared to WFH, where I don’t need to wake up so early to cook-shower-commute, can take breaks when needed (which helps me focus and finish tasks faster), move around, and avoid commuting, WFO feels unbearable.  

I’m also FED UP with my tasks. They are repetitive and uninteresting. At least I can lay down at home instead of being stuck in an uncomfortable chair all day.  

I’ve tried coping strategies like “breaking into smaller steps”, but nothing works. Working outdoors helps slightly, but it’s raised questions. Music, brown noise, and timers don’t help much. Coffee breaks give temporary relief, but exhaustion returns the second I sit down. Pushing through only leads to breakdowns.  

I can’t quit because I’m under contract and need the salary for medical expenses. Remote jobs are hard to get, even in IT. Switching careers isn’t an option because programming is the only thing I’m good at that pays well, but I HATE office jobs.  

I feel completely trapped. Does anyone else experience this? How do you push through extreme task paralysis, burnout, and ADHD meltdowns when quitting isn’t an option?

# 2 Quart Saucepans 2025: Top-rated Models Compared & Expert Recommendations!

Are you on the hunt for the perfect⁣ 2 quart saucepan ⁤to elevate your ⁤cooking game? Whether ​you're a seasoned home cook,a busy individual whipping up quick ‍meals,or​ a budget-conscious shopper seeking quality without breaking⁣ the bank,a good ⁤2 qt saucepan is an essential kitchen ⁤tool. This guide‌ breaks down the best 2 ‌quart saucepans ‌of 2025, comparing top-rated models and offering expert recommendations tailored to your specific needs.‍ We'll explore ⁢various materials, features, brands, and use cases to help you make an informed ‍purchase.

[[Explore Top Rated 2 quart saucepan on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=2 quart saucepan)
## Why a​ 2 Quart Saucepan? Understanding ‍Size and⁤ Capacity

The size of your cookware matters. A 2 quart saucepan strikes a sweet spot for many cooking tasks. It's larger⁣ then a mini saucepan but smaller than a stockpot, making‌ it ideal for everything ⁣from heating ‍up sauces to cooking grains and small ‌batches of soup.

Consider the saucepan capacity⁣ carefully. A 2 quart saucepan (or‍ two quart saucepan, ⁤as it's frequently enough written) is perfect for:

*   **Individuals ‍and small families:** Heating⁤ up single-serving meals, preparing smaller ⁣portions of​ pasta⁣ or ‌rice,‌ and making sauces.
*   **Sauce making:** ‌The size is ideal for creating tasty​ sauces without ⁢excessive reduction.
*   **Side dishes:** cooking grains, vegetables, or small portions of‌ potatoes.
*   **Boiling eggs:** A 2 quart saucepan offers enough‌ space for efficient ⁢boiling.*   **Heating liquids:**⁤ Warming milk for ⁣your morning coffee or melting butter.

compared to larger ​pots, a 2 qt saucepan is easier to handle and clean, and it takes up less ⁤storage space. When thinking about sauce ⁢pan dimensions, a 2 quart saucepan ‌offers convenience⁤ without sacrificing functionality.

## material‌ Matters: Choosing the Right 2 Quart Saucepan⁣ for Your Needs

The material of your 2 quart saucepan‌ significantly‍ impacts its⁣ performance, durability, and ease of use. Here's ⁣a breakdown of common ‌materials:

*   **Stainless ⁤Steel Saucepan:** A popular ‌choice due ⁢to ‌its durability, resistance to rust, and even heating. Stainless steel​ cookware is generally oven safe and ​compatible with all cooktops, ‌including induction. Look for stainless steel ‍saucepans with a clad construction (e.g., All-Clad saucepan) for ⁣superior heat distribution.

*   **Non-Stick ⁣Saucepan:**‌ Ideal for delicate foods⁣ like⁣ eggs, ⁢pancakes, and certain sauces, as it‌ prevents⁢ sticking and makes cleanup a breeze. Non stick cookware typically features a coating of Teflon or other non-stick materials. While convenient, non-stick saucepans may not be as durable as stainless steel and may require more careful handling ⁤to avoid scratching the surface.

*⁢ ​  **Ceramic Saucepan:** Often marketed as ‍a healthier alternative ‍to conventional non-stick​ coatings,ceramic saucepans ⁣offer similar ‍non-stick properties. They're generally free of harmful chemicals like PFOA and PTFE. However, ceramic coatings can degrade over time, ‌especially with high heat.

*   **Aluminum Saucepan:** Aluminum is an excellent heat conductor,‍ providing rapid and even heating. Though, aluminum cookware can react with acidic foods and may warp over time. Anodized aluminum saucepans are treated to create ‍a ​harder, more durable surface‌ that is less reactive.

*   **Copper Saucepan:**‌ Prized for its extraordinary heat conductivity, copper cookware offers precise temperature control.‍ However, copper ‍saucepans are typically more expensive and require special maintenance to prevent⁣ tarnishing.

*   ⁢**Enameled Cast Iron Saucepan:** Combines the heat ‍retention of cast ‌iron with the durability​ and easy ⁤cleanup of enamel.⁤ Enameled cast iron saucepans‌ are great for slow cooking and braising but can ⁣be heavy and‌ may‍ not be ideal for all‍ cooktops.

*   **Induction Saucepan:** Specifically designed for use on induction‍ cooktops, these saucepans‍ are made with magnetic materials, ​frequently enough stainless‍ steel or cast iron, that allow them to heat up quickly and efficiently. Many of the previously mentioned materials can be induction compatible.

Consider ⁤your cooking style and priorities when choosing⁣ the material ⁢for ​your ‍2 quart saucepan. Stainless steel is ⁢a versatile option for​ most ‌cooks,while non-stick is ideal​ for specific tasks.

## Features and Design: What to Look For in a 2 Quart Saucepan

Beyond the material, several key features and design elements can⁤ enhance your cooking experience.

*   **Saucepan ‌with ⁣Lid:** A well-fitting lid is essential for trapping heat and moisture, speeding⁣ up⁣ cooking times, and⁢ preventing⁤ splatters. Look for a tempered glass lid that allows​ you ⁣to monitor the cooking⁣ process without lifting ⁣the lid. ‍See the value in both a ⁤glass lid‍ and also a stainless steel lid, depending on your cooking submission.

*‍   **Glass Lid:** A tempered glass lid ‌lets you keep an eye on your cooking without releasing heat.

* ⁢  **Pouring Spout:** A ⁢pouring spout makes ⁣it easier ⁢to transfer liquids without ‍spills, especially when dealing with hot‍ sauces or soups.

*⁢   **Helper Handle:** A helper handle provides extra support when lifting and maneuvering a full⁢ saucepan, especially useful for heavier materials like cast iron.

*   **Ergonomic ‍Handle:** ‍Comfort is key.Look for a heat resistant handle ⁣that stays cool to the touch and provides a ⁤secure grip. Consider the material⁣ of the handle. Stainless steel handles can be prone to heating up.

*  ​ **Dishwasher Safe:** For easy cleanup, choose a dishwasher safe saucepan. Be sure to verify the dishwasher safety of products. ‌Many non-stick items will specify hand-wash only.

*‍   **Oven Safe:**​ an oven safe saucepan is a⁣ versatile tool for finishing dishes or keeping food warm.‌ Again, verify this carefully. Many handles on cheaper cookware might‌ not be oven safe.

*   **induction Compatible:** If‌ you have an induction cooktop, ensure that the saucepan is​ specifically designed‌ for induction cooking. Many stainless​ steel and cast iron saucepans are‌ induction ⁣compatible.

*   **cookware Set Consideration:** While⁤ focusing on a single saucepan, also consider if ‌the saucepan you are buying has a ⁣matching cookware set available. This would allow you​ to expand‍ your matching cookware later.

Since I have family on this app, I won't say what I do, but it falls under the category of personal care services and sales - think salon style jobs.
We have many regulars, and I've already memorized most of our everyday clients, including the person I've been considering asking out. 
This person, [20F], has been coming in almost everyday since I started, and I'm completely infatuated. We've only chatted a few times, but I seriously cannot stop thinking about her. She's the kind of person who doesn't say a word but still manages to draw the room. Extremely beautiful, but in a more quiet, elegant fashion. She usually comes in after work, no makeup and messy hair, but she's the kind of beautiful that doesn't rely on dolled-up looks or fancy clothes to shine. 
I'm not really the type to be interested in relationships or seek people out, as I'm usually fine being alone but it's been driving me crazy. 
Everyday she walks through that door my heart flutters and my day becomes instantly better.
But I feel bad. I feel like a creep. I don't even know if she swings this way, and yet everyday I find myself waiting for her to come in, wondering if she'll show up today. I don't know what to do. 
I don't want to be unprofessional and ask her out, and I especially don't want her to feel grossed out or awkward if she isn't interested, but I can't help but feel like I'm running out of time. 
I love this job, and will probably end up working in the same, or a similar profession once I'm gone, but I'm not going to stay at this place forever. The management is terrible and most of the employees don't do their jobs - with some notable exceptions - and if it weren't for this client, I don't think I'd even be working here still. I'm afraid though, that if I do nothing I'll always wonder what could've been.
I know I'm young, but I've never felt such strong attracting to anyone like this before. It's like sitting on the porch during a calm winter night with a coffee and a blanket. It's such a perfect warm, cozy feeling when she's here, but that only scares me more. I've always been extremely independent, both in my personal life and work life. Been working since 15 and paying bills since 17 and I'm afraid that if I get into anything serious, it might jeopardized that lifestyle that I've made for myself. 
So reddit, what should I do? Should I take my chances and ask her out? Or should I get over myself and leave her alone? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",0,1741540334.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,2,0.33,False

Then I solo traveled to 5 European cities and it completely transformed me. Here's where you should go if you're an introvert like me.

Three years ago, I had a panic attack in a Starbucks because the barista asked if I wanted room for cream. Today, I've solo traveled to 12 countries, worked as a tour guide in Turkey, and run a travel blog. The transformation wasn't gradual - it was a series of terrifying leaps that became easier each time. For introverts wondering about the [best places to solo travel in Europe](https://simplitty.com/best-places-to-solo-travel-in-europe/), I've compiled the cities that specifically helped rewire my anxious brain.

# The moment everything changed

My first solo trip started with me crying in an airport bathroom, questioning all my life choices. I'd researched for months, created laminated emergency cards with Turkish phrases, and still felt completely unprepared.

On day three, thoroughly exhausted from overthinking every interaction, I got on the wrong bus in Antalya. Instead of panicking, something strange happened - I surrendered. The bus took me to a neighborhood no guidebook mentioned, where I found a tiny family restaurant with zero English speakers. Through gestures and smiles, I had the most incredible meal of my life while the grandmother kept bringing extra dishes and patting my shoulder approvingly.

I realized in that moment that solo travel isn't about perfect itineraries - it's about discovering who you become when nobody's watching and you're completely free to reinvent yourself.

For context: I'm a 36F who's worked in both tourism and IT. I'm naturally introverted (INFJ) and have always dealt with social anxiety. I mention this because I want fellow introverts to know that if I can do this, anyone can.

Here are my top 5 destinations, specifically ranked for introverts who need both beauty and breathing room:

# 1. Rome, Italy - Perfect for dawn explorers

**Why it works for introverts:** Early risers can experience iconic sites almost alone

Thanks to jet lag, I stumbled toward the Trevi Fountain at 5:30 AM in pajama pants (hastily covered with a jacket). For twenty minutes, it was just me and one of the world's most famous monuments. No crowds, no selfie sticks - just the splash of water and the strange sensation of time folding in on itself.

**Pro tips for the anxiety-prone:**

* The Colosseum opens at 8:30AM - be there at 8:15 with a pre-booked ticket
* For the Vatican, book the first entry and head directly to the Sistine Chapel before it gets crowded
* Cross-body bags hugged against you are essential - pickpockets love distracted tourists

**Best introvert activity:** Find a perch near the Trevi Fountain with a book and cappuccino. Alternate between reading and people-watching. Pure magic.

**When to go:** April-June or September-October. Summer crowds and heat will test even the most resilient introvert.

# 2. Florence, Italy - The walkable wonder

**Why it works for introverts:** Human-scaled city with plenty of quiet corners

After Rome's sensory overload, Florence felt like a gentle hug. The walkable size means you're never far from your hotel if you need a recharge, and the Renaissance atmosphere somehow encourages thoughtful solitude.

**Pro tips for the anxiety-prone:**

* Book timed entry tickets for the Uffizi online to avoid awkward line conversations
* The Boboli Gardens offer perfect escape when the city center gets overwhelming
* Small museums like the Bargello often have a fraction of the crowds with equally impressive art

**Best introvert activity:** Take a solo picnic to the rose garden near Piazzale Michelangelo. You'll have panoramic views and plenty of space to be alone with your thoughts.

**When to go:** April-May or September-October for pleasant temperatures and manageable crowds.

# 3. Antalya, Turkey - The transformative one

**Why it works for introverts:** Perfect blend of beaches for recharging and culture for exploring

Antalya holds a special place in my heart after working there as a guide. This Mediterranean gem blends ancient history with natural beauty, and the Turkish hospitality culture is incredibly welcoming to solo travelers without being overwhelming.

**Pro tips for the anxiety-prone:**

* Konyaaltı Beach is perfect for solo beach days - long enough to find your own space
* Old Town (Kaleiçi) has plenty of small courtyard cafés where sitting alone with a book feels natural
* Dress modestly outside of resort areas to avoid unwanted attention

**Best introvert activity:** Find a tiny tea garden in the old town where an old man plays traditional saz music as you sip çay and watch the sunset over ancient harbor walls.

**When to go:** April-May or September-October when temperatures are perfect and you can actually explore without melting.

# 4. Warsaw, Poland - The budget-friendly surprise

**Why it works for introverts:** Affordable luxury means private rooms instead of shared hostels

I visited Warsaw with embarrassingly low expectations and left completely enchanted. This underrated city combines fascinating history, incredible food, and prices that won't destroy your budget.

**Pro tips for the anxiety-prone:**

* The public transportation system is excellent and has English signage
* Museum cafés are perfect quiet spots to regroup between activities
* Locals might seem stern at first but are incredibly helpful if you need assistance

**Best introvert activity:** Spend a quiet morning in Łazienki Park watching peacocks strut around the Palace on the Water while locals jog and walk their dogs.

**When to go:** May-June for perfect walking weather and festival atmosphere.

# 5. Vienna, Austria - For sophisticated solitude

**Why it works for introverts:** Coffee house culture that celebrates sitting alone for hours

My most recent solo adventure took me to Vienna, which feels designed for sophisticated introverts who appreciate beauty, culture, and excellent cake. The Viennese coffeehouse tradition actively encourages lingering alone with a book or your thoughts.

**Pro tips for the anxiety-prone:**

* The public transport runs like clockwork, reducing travel stress
* Concert tickets can often be purchased last-minute for solo travelers
* Traditional coffeehouses expect people to stay for hours - no awkward ""are you still working on that?"" moments

**Best introvert activity:** Spend an afternoon in a traditional Viennese coffeehouse like Café Central with a book and endless refills, surrounded by marble columns and the ghosts of writers past.

**When to go:** May-June or September-October for pleasant temperatures and fewer tourist groups.

# The Anxious Traveler's Toolkit

These essentials have saved me countless times:

1. **Noise-canceling headphones:** Your personal force field on trains, in busy markets, or whenever you need to create a bubble
2. **A kindle loaded with books:** Perfect company for solo dinners when you want a break from being ""on""
3. **Google Maps offline downloads:** Reduces the stress of navigation and the need to ask for directions
4. **An ""introvert recovery"" day between major activities:** Some of my most magical moments happened on days where my only goal was ""find a nice café""
5. **The power of morning:** Attractions are magical before the crowds arrive, and early success sets a confident tone for your day

# What solo travel taught me that therapy couldn't

Each city revealed something therapy had tried to teach me for years:

* I'm more resourceful than I believe
* Most people are fundamentally kind and willing to help
* Making mistakes isn't the end of the world
* The voice in my head that catastrophizes is almost always wrong

The first morning I woke up alone in a hotel room in a foreign country, I felt a moment of panic. By the end of that first week, I felt a freedom I'd never known - the exhilarating realization that I could go anywhere, do anything, and answer to no one but myself.

Has anyone else found that solo travel helped with anxiety or introversion? Or do you have questions about any of these destinations specifically? Happy to provide more detailed advice for fellow nervous explorers.

First 50km, perfect. Cool air, empty roads, that early morning hum of the engine. Tucked in slightly on the straights, let the twin purr. Felt good.

100km in, flow state. Bike’s dialed in, every shift feels clean. Found a stretch of road with some nice curves, leaned in, flicked through. GT was loving it. So was I.

Pulled up to the café, parked. Took a second. Bike looked right, the stance, the chrome, the slight heat waves coming off the engine. Walked in, ordered a coffee, sat down. Just sat. No rush, no scrolling, just being there.

Ride back? Even better. Sun lower, air cooler, the kind of ride where you forget about everything else for a while.

This doctor there works for the Cleveland Clinic there and has written books and has a $1200 program to try and get people on the diet. The whole thing just seems like a money grab to me with very weak science.

The diet basically says not to eat meat, fish,  sugar, oils, coffee, dairy, eggs, nuts, coconuts or avocados. Basically the diet believes all fats are bad.

White flour is discouraged as well as fruit juice.

However, all fruit is fine as well as whole grains. The guy who created the diet is always mentioning eating cereal so it seems to me that the only way this diet can work is by eating lots of carbohydrates from the grains or fruits mostly.

I can't imagine what my blood glucose would be doing on a diet like this swinging up and down all the time. I recon I would be getting sleepy from all these blood glucose swings and eating lots.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

An appropriate approach may be a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.

1j7c6mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1j7c6mq/high_gut_motility_bloating/,High Gut Motility + Bloating,"Hello Guys,

I'm gonna keep it as short as possible. I always had High Gut Motility & am very sensitive to caffeine. So there is no problem for me to 💩 2-5 times daily with normal stool. Sometimes if im too stressed or drank too much caffeine i might end up with some diarrhea in the evening after eating.

Im going to the gym around 5 times a week for 10 years now, not overweight, good nutrition etc. but i still end up bloating most of the time. Kind of food doesn't matter too much so basically no intolerance, rather depends how much cals and how fatty the food is. If im on a clean diet, im feeling better of course, but i still experience bloating.

Back in the day like years ago I had a bad experience in a city where I had food poisoning and had a hard time. Since then i have problems eating food outside. As a child I always had problems with constipation which is weird because now it's basically the opposite. As I said if I'm not stressed and at home my digestion is pretty much fine. It's mentally fucked up because it makes travelling so hard. Stress and Cortisol can cause leaky gut in stressful situations, which fits me perfectly.

In the morning it's normal for me to 💩 at least 2 times, my body always wants to clean itself especially with  coffee.

So this week I had to take antibiotics because of an infection. I always drink Kefir an was pretty much fine but I tried a Probiotic Supplement and I got so bloated you cant imagine. I took it in the evening and in the morning it was game over.

That's why I think it may be SIFO, because my symptoms are basically the opposite of SIBO. I'm thinking about sending in a stool Test to check everything from Leaky Gut, to Candida, Microbiome etc. Having to 💩 often can be reliefing for people who can't, but for people like me it's really annoying, because its so hard while travelling or beeing outside. You always fear you have to shit anywhere.

Maybe there is someone here too with similar symptom combination, I would really appreciate any tips. I bought oregano oil but dont want to try it because it can destroy my gut even more than probiotics.

I don't know what to do and I feel like a cruel person.","I live at home to take care of my mom (70s), which I'm fine with. I can deal with mom. Dad (70s) is here too and needs no care, but he doesn't do a thing to help. He's never a go-getter and has always hated working, so he's always been like a grown up baby than a man. He quit office jobs in order to bag groceries because it was ""more fun"". He just never could cope with adult responsibilities. Currently he's in the process of retiring with no savings. I'm terrified that I'll once again be thrown into their financial mess. But my mom enables his behavior and further babies him. But when it's just her and I, she's not like that. 

When my mom became unable to drive many years ago, I took over. My mom took his keys after he blew through a few red lights and claimed, ""I didn't see them"", this was 15 years ago.

Whenever my mom and I go out, she makes him come along, or else there's a fight and she says, ""You have to take him out! He never goes anywhere!!"". He's not physically disabled like my mom is and there's lots of public transportation. 

We had an argument this weekend. I own my car and have been working very hard to pay for it. I have a rule of no eating in it, besides coffee that my mom and I like to get. I have this rule because of my father, who always makes a mess when he eats (I have to vacuum and clean up his place after every meal because he spills food everywhere). I treated my mom and I to drive thru coffee, but then she began begging me to get my dad something to eat because he had not eaten all day. But dad said he didn't want anything.

I said I'm not allowing him to eat in my car. This sent my mom into a near emotional breakdown. She threatens me with, ""You're going to kill me with a heart attack!!!"" and ""You're cruel for getting us coffee and not offering something to your father!!"" No, I'm not. He doesn't drink coffee. He should have ate before we left for the day. But then my mom starts to cry because she feels like saying ""no"" to him is the equivalent of denying an infant a diaper change. 

So I had to buy him food, which he ate in my backseat, getting it all over the place and then refusing to wipe his hands with a wet wipe. He proceeded to touch the leather seats and door, getting grease marks all over. I asked if he could get out of the car and brush off the crumbs, but he threw a hissy fit and then angrily brushed the crumbs off himself and all over the backseat floor. When he finally took the wet wipe, he barely wiped his fingertips and then asked ""What do I do with this wipe now?!"" It feels like dealing with a bratty child, that's how frustrating his behavior is.

I am not responsible for his meals and he's been capable of getting food for himself. But now he waits until me or my mom get it for him and place it on the table and tell him to come to the table and eat. This is new behavior in the past 3 months - if we do not feed him, he does not eat. He has had several fainting spells from lack of eating. 

And yes, we have asked him to talk to his doctor about what is going on. Something is not right with this behavior. But he refuses to address it. Idk what to do unless I have to start going into his appointments with him. I am not going to take care of both my parents. Dad would have to get outside care.

I'm at a loss. I don't want to fight with my parents. I don't want to be cruel. But I don't know what's wrong with my dad - is it real? Is he just pulling weaponized incompetence? My dad is a pathological liar so I don't trust anything he does, but what if something is actually wrong?",4,1741539701.0,CaregiverSupport,2,1.0,False

Now that era has formally sailed; it's apparent how much the whole post-irony movement shaped the culture as a whole. Vinyl records are a commodity at your local Target, and specialty coffee and boutique beers are everywhere.

My home is bright and colorful, full of personality and items which fascinate me. I can't help it, and it's so foreign to me when I visit others and see their millennial grey walls full of generic Marshall Fields farmhouse art, etc. Trying to discuss movies or music with coworkers makes me feel like I'm speaking a different language entirely. Their obsession with bourbon, golf, and country music escapes me. While I'm not expecting anyone to be some foreign film versed weirdo listening to Sonic Youth b-sides, it always leaves me curious how so few take interest in diving deeper in the arts or entertainment. Then I realize, ah yes, those were the things which defined my upbringing.

So yes, in retrospect, I'm grateful to have grown up within the hipster generation. I don't seek much wealth beyond stability because I learned to make more out of less, and am far more fascinated with things which money can't buy. Have a great Sunday, everyone.",63,1741539544.0,rs_x,10,0.98,False

However, for the past 5 years (basically when i started drinking coffee...) I have had a battle with large inflamed acne on my cheeks. these pimples were almost cystic, they never had a head but are HUGE, swollen, and RED. they would hurt my face and take at least a week to start disappearing. my pores were very large because of the swelling.

Now, before you say ""it was sugar in the coffee!"" I drank my coffee with very little sugar, and the sweetener I used was only Stevia. I still use stevia today for some drinks like iced tea or low calorie desserts. No issues.

I fully believe that coffee caused my acne. Even decaf has issues with my GERD, but the caffeine made it so much worse. It does not help that i already have anxiety... so the high caffeine was definitely making my body stressed. Probably way too much cortisol.

I still drink caffeinated tea (so many varieties!!!) and my skin is fine!!

I wanted to make this post because I have been SUFFERING for 5 years and no one has ever told me to stop coffee. I have no pictures to show you what I looked like before, because my self confidence was so terrible I would NEVER take pictures if I had a lot of pimples and I would edit the pimples out.

Just hit 100,800 miles and while driving last night: ""Hybrid System Warning. Safely Stop and Do Not Drive"". Advice?","So, over the past 6 months I took my car in twice.  The first was for an slightly early 100k service because I wanted my car ready for a long drive, wanted to replace belts, etc.  Then about 1 month ago I took the car in because I was hearing some noises from the front of the car while driving/idling.  It was like a coffee percolator.  

&nbsp;

They did a full diagnostic, didn't really find anything major.  They recommended replacing coolant for the hybrid and engine coolant system, which I agreed with doing.  I also see also on the invoice that they replaced a leaky valve cover gasket. 

&nbsp;

Last night, I got the 'Hybrid System Warning. Safely Stop and Do Not Drive' warning on the dash.  I pulled over, turned off my car.  Looked some stuff up online, found that the warning could mean damn near anything.  Turned the car back on and drove the small amount left home.  The Service Engine light is now on, however. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Is there any way for me NOT to pay another diagnostic fee?  It feels insane to me that after having the car fully assessed twice, by two different Hyundai service centers, that I would have to pay for diagnostics again for something that I feel like should have been caught.  Any advice for not having to pay?  The car is just barely over 100k miles, it's at 100,800.

We spend 20-25 minutes on the floor at the beginning of the wake window usually, looking at toys and using the kick and play piano mat, about 5 mins of that time is tummy time since she’s still not big on it. I sing to her and touch her hands to her toes and stuff.

After that I might carry her around and talk to her or if she’s squirmy put her back on the floor and let her be independent for a few seconds while I make coffee or lunch or whatever. 

Feeding her currently takes 30-40 minutes with burps and initial upright time

About 20-30 minutes of her wake windows might be in the maxi cosi bouncer because she loves it so much she loves sitting up after eating. So if I need to do something I’ll sit her in it while she watches me do stuff and she’s often content or if I don’t have anything pressing I’ll read her books while she is in it I try to read to her most windows because my mom read to me a lot.

Then if she is sleepy right now I attempt the crib as practice some naps but it usually only lasts 5-30 minutes then we either contact nap and I play a game on the computer or I put her in the carrier and get stuff done around the house.

I just hope between the carrier and bouncer it’s not too much container time. Her head isn’t flat so it seems ok.",1,1741539115.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

Everything went back to normal, except for the taste/smell of cigarettes, coffee, and things like that. I rushed to the hospital because I was panicking, and they reassured me, telling me that in most cases, everything returns to normal.

Now, here I am—9-10 months later with this condition, which, even though it's partial, has been causing a lot of depression. In the first few days, I noticed some very minimal improvement, but it was really small 🥲.

Can anyone give me some advice? Is there anything I can do about it? I've also noticed that when I get sick, the smells and tastes that are already altered tend to get worse, and then slightly improve when I get better. Will i recover?

I had been behind the wheel for about three hours at this point and hardly had any sleep the previous two nights. In truth the only thing that was keeping me awake was coffee and sheer determination not to get in a car accident.

The side road I was taking was new to me, but according to the map it was only thirty six miles more than it would have been if I was going on the freeway. Not bad considering how long I had been driving up to this point and that I still had another half an hour to go. 

I was deep into farm country when I came across the first headlights I saw since turning off the main road. It was those annoyingly bright ones where, once installed, the driver will magically forget that low beams exist. 

As we got closer to each other I tried to shield my eyes while also attempting to see the road in front of me. I swore at the driver of the truck when we passed each other, and it wasn't like he could have heard me either, however the moment we passed the other he whipped a U turn so fast that there was no mistaking that he was coming for me. 

My car isn't going to win any races, so it didn't take long before he got right up to my bumper, flashed his high beams (amazingly what I saw before was the low beams, why these lights are still legal I have no idea) and layed on the horn. 

Naturally I was freaked out and my mind was running wild. The only thing that comforted me was the fact I had a loaded gun in the center council. I hoped I wouldn't have to use it, but this guy wouldn't leave me alone. 

I was tired, had a hard day and my mind wasn't thinking right, otherwise I wouldn't have pulled over. 

The plan was that I was going to aim the gun at the driver, tell them off and watch them drive off. However before I could do any of that the truck pulled up right next to me, rolled the window down and said this:

“The person in the trunk is trying to flag down other drivers, man. Figured I would let you know. Professional courtesy, you know? Have a good day.”

1j7bjwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1j7bjwg/urge_to_pee_for_nearly_two_months/,Urge to Pee for Nearly Two Months,"To preface this post, I'm most likely going to be visiting a urologist in the upcoming week or the week following after this one. I'm just coming here seeing if the explanation of my symptom(s) sounds comparable to something that doctors here might have encountered in the past. I'm just at the end of my rope now because it's becoming a debilitating effect on my mental well-being and it's untenably taxing.

Hey there, my name is Josh. I'm a 31 year old white male from Chicago without a medical history prior to my issue. I'm about 295 pounds. No allergies or intolerances that I am aware of, the only family medical history issue that I am aware of is high blood pressure. This isn't about high blood pressure however.

Around the 11th or 12th of January I started feeling sort of weird down near my nether regions. Thought it could just be something off for the day so I slept it off. Around the 13th or 14th of January I woke up, went to pee, felt the usual tingle when you're peeing and then it just didn't go away. 
I thought it could be a UTI considering when I was like 22-23 I had something similar to this and it felt exactly like that UTI almost ten years ago. I tackled it with a mixture of flushing water and unsweetened cranberry concentrate throughout the next few weeks. The symptom felt like it got slightly better, but didn't go entirely away.

Around the middle part of February I went to an Urgent Clinic and they took a urine sample and did a dipstick test. The dipstick came back negative and the PA that saw me suspected it could potentially be an overactive bladder. 

I'll go over the same answers with her for the questions given: I was going what felt like about every 40 minutes with an urge to pee that did not go away even after relieving myself. When I did urinate, it was always a strong stream and was usually a pale yellow, sometimes a deeper yellow. My urine didn't look out of the ordinary, I didn't see any odd cloudiness, it didn't smell any different than how my urine normally smells (not that I'm regularly smelling my urine) and it always felt like everything that was in my bladder came out in that urination/I was emptying my bladder fully. 

She prescribed me 10mg of Oxybutynin for about two weeks and after going through that prescription I can't really say anything has changed. Maybe the urge to pee has lessened slightly?? But it's very hard to tell. I'm going about every 3-4 hours now and I'm able to successfully hold my urine for that duration, it's still a strong stream and I am not leaking nor am I getting up in the middle of the night to urinate. I work in physical labor lifting heavy bags weighing anywhere between 30 to 50 pounds, no leakage there either even when hoisiting bags. 

I used to regularly drink caffeine, but it never caused any issues. Out of anything the only benefit that a cup of coffee gave me was helping to loosen me up in the day to process my stool, but never have I had any urinary issues before this with the one exception being that UTI roughly in 2014-2015. I have been drinking exclusively water, not excessively, slow sipping throughout the day but I am still feeling the urge to pee. It feels very much centered near my urethra, it's not in my bladder/pelvic region, I've felt that pressure before and that isn't it. When I press on my pelvic region there's no pain or sensitivity. I have noticed that in the last few weeks that I've gotten occasional discomfort in my sides/where my love handles are, like an ache that lasts for a few minutes but dissipates shortly after.

My pee is still a pale yellow color. No discoloration, bloody urine or cloudiness. I'm urinating anywhere between 3-4 hours, at the most urgency 2 1/2. I'm not waking up in the middle of the night to pee, nor am I experiencing leakage. The only thing I'm experiencing is a constant urge to pee in my urethral area. 

If any professional or person who has encountered this in the past can share their experience with a situation or situations like this, I would be eternally thankful. Thank you so much for reading.",1,1741538369.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1j7bi6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1j7bi6z/success_with_snus_in_italy/,Success with SNUs in Italy,"I share many on this sub's frustrations with SNUs being largely useless, at least in the US. I actually have twice been upgraded and shown up to find the upgrade removed by the hotel, then had to contact corporate to get the SNUs put back in my account. 

However, I want to share two successes I recently had in Florence, Italy. 

**Sina Villa Medici, Autograph Collection**  
Booked base room. Applied SNU. Got notice of upgrade to a suite. Upon checkin they further upgraded me to the ""Royal Suite"" - their top room. It included an enormous living room, which easily and comfortably seats 20 people. So, spent about $300, got a $3000 room. That was a lot of fun!

Nice welcome amenity of local snacks. 

**St. Regis Florence**  
Booked base room via points (80,000/night). Applied SNU. Got upgraded to ""Deluxe Suite, 1 King, Arno River View."" This room comes with the butler service, has a living room, two full bathrooms, and a beautiful balcony. During my stay it was selling for $4,200/night. Incredible stay - far and away the nicest hotel I've experienced in Italy. Unbelievable, really. 

Butler service emailed me asking about things I like in Italy and plans for my stay. They then used the info to make a custom welcome amenity that included a bottle of wine that I enjoy and - because I said I love coffee and was visiting an espresso machine factory while in town - a custom-engraved Moka Pot. 

Just truly superb, and an unbelievable value considering the points used and the upgrade. 



By the way, to add to some now-outdated posts asking for a comparison of those two hotels... if you're comparing the two and have the means to choose between them or are looking to use points, there is no comparison. It's like an Audi vs a Maybach. The Audi is nice and nothing to complain about. Absolutely a luxury vehicle. The Maybach is just in a class of its own. ",1,1741538243.0,marriott,5,0.67,False

Early March. Visited WDW a few times before, the latest being mid 2024. Will try to cover not so usual things here (eg I have a small bladder and drink lots of fluids) and less of the rides itself.

**Package**: 4-day/3-night at Cheyenne, with tickets+breakfast included

**Booking**: I had booked online for 3 guests and then needed to call to add 4th person. Only way to do any changes is by phone. It was super easy to adjust though and they even took the time to adjust dining reservations as well. Bear in mind that the phone number is from England, so I had to do an overseas call for it to work (they do not seem that prepared to receive visitors from outside Europe).

**Transportation**: took the official Magical Shuttle transfer from CDG. Super easy to book online. Bear in mind that it was not so easy to find the departing point, mostly because CDG is huge and signs are not always 100% clear and objective. What we did was keep looking for the Bus signs till we found the ticket booth and then asked there. Service was really good, took roughly 1 hour to get to the hotel. Really convenient not having to carry luggage through trains. Buses have no toilet.

**Check-in**: arrived earlier than check-in time (around 11am, check-in starts 3pm) but checked-in anyways, after a short line. Luggage storage has a big line before/close to 11am (check-out time).
I was given a room card key and told that our room would be assigned automatically, what ended up not happening. I had to go back to front desk to have room assigned. Not the end of the world, since I needed to retrieve luggage anyways. But be prepared cause, depending on where your room is and where you’re coming from, it may be quite a walk. There is only a bathroom by the Chuck Wagon restaurant, did not find any other one other than the room one.

**Hotel overall**: I’ve read reviews that it was old and, oh boy, it looks like it’s from the 1800’s! Relax, it’s just a joke. Hotel is fine and well maintained. A few renovations going on as well.

**Characters on hotel**: supposedly Woody and Jesse come and go, but we got as little as a glimpse of both. We weren’t expecting much and did late breakfasts, but for some this may be an issue.

**Rooms**: larger than the usual Parisian hotel room but quite smaller than your typical Orlando room. 4 of us were comfortable, a bit more of space wouldn’t hurt though. Very clean, with complimentary coffee and tea.
Rooms are located on spread out independent buildings, so this hotel may not be a good option in bad weather scenario. Stayed on Sundance building, on the far end closest to the parks. It was good cause we would need to walk a bit more for breakfast, but on the end of the day it was less walking from the parks. Bathroom has a tub + shower.

**Breakfast**: 9-10am is the busiest time, with a line to get seated. We avoided this period and there was no line, also super quiet. Food is not great, not bad, just ok. Good selection of bread. In the end it is worth it for the convenience (bear in mind the walk from room building though). There are some options at Disney Village, though, that you walk by when heading to the parks.

**Disney Village**: tiny and currently being heavily renovated, so it feels even tinier. Just one public bathroom available, inside Billy Bob’s Saloon. Not all restaurants can be booked through the app like in Disney Springs. It is feasible to have lunch or dinner there and then head back to the parks, but despite being tiny it still is quite a walk and time consuming, even though you got through security only one time.

**Christmas Decor**: only one place sells them and it’s the store underneath the castle at Disneyland. Not a huge variety of stuff.

**From/to the parks**: I’ve read reviews that Cheyenne is super far away. Disney says +/- 20mins walk to the parks. I think it really depends on where your room building is located at. But I did not find it terrible and not so different than the walk from MK to Contemporary, for instance. You just follow the little river and then get to Disney Village. We did not need to take the free shuttle.

**Walking distance / Stroller for young ones**: I would strongly recommend bringing a stroller. Even though the parks are smaller than Orlando, in our case this just means we can do more. Also distance from/to parks. Average distance doing 1 park/day was 11km and 15km on the day we did both parks.

**Bathrooms**: this I found to be the biggest difference from the Orlando standard. It is definitely not the bathroom smorgasbord. There are few locations, on both parks. They get pretty crowded, with lines specially for women. During the parade and fireworks it gets pretty difficult to get to them. Even restaurants don’t necessarily have them (PYM Factory actually has a door connecting to an outside bathroom and Plaza has literally 1 stall only). They are not even close in cleanliness as well.

**Food**: we did PYM Factory and Plaza for sit down. Good enough buffet, sodas are not free refill. Orlando sit down seems to me to be on a different level, though. Fast food we did Coco, Stark Factory. Good amount of seating, to rest a bit, food just ok. Did not do character dining cause found it too expensive, even comparing to Orlando.

**Snacks**: not as many options in Orlando and not as good ones. You just see Lays and Doritos everywhere. And the Christmas fair kiosks seemed to be the best options. Good thing is that there are espressos everywhere.

**Parade**: the parks are smaller, so even when not crowded the parade route gets packed. We found that to get a good front-row view you need to be 45-mins in place before the show starts. I also found that it is less busy on the beginning sections of the parade’s route.

**Fireworks**: really worth to see it, in my opinion it is better than the MK one. But, as per cited above, the park get’s jammed with people for this. I found that you need to be in place at least 1 hour before the show starts to get a good view. It get’s even worse cause people come from Walt Disney Studios for the show (depending on the time, there is a line to enter the park). Disney sells tickets for a reserved viewing area - it was all sold out days before our trip even started. If you’re into nighttime show and your budget allows it, I’d definitely check this.

**Uber availability**: we took an Uber Van to Paris, hotel close to Eiffel Tower, on a Friday night. It arrived in less than 5 minutes, so there’s a good availability there. EUR 120 and 1hour trip, super pleasant.

**English**: We speak a little french, but literally every cast member we interacted spoke a reasonable english.

Buying “fancy” soap is expensive. So why not make it yourself. This way you can control the ingredients and source them to your liking + it’s 837% cheaper. 

After 6 weeks of curing my tallow soap is done! This is a cold process cured soap(which I do find makes for a harder more dense longer lasting soap) . This batch made 18 bars. Or one years of soap for basically free. 

PH came out to 10.20 which I’m happy with. I typically aim for 10. 

My base recipe is;
44 oz. tallow (any kind you like, I used beef tallow) 
12 oz. pine bark (ground fine, coffee grinder works amazing) 
12 oz. lye ( I use white ash lye (ph 13.5) ) 
32 oz. cold well water (rain water works great also) 

1. Melt the tallow in the crockpot.

2. Once the fat is nearly all melted, carefully measure the lye.

3. In an area with good ventilation, carefully stir the lye into the measured water. ALWAYS add the lye to the water– do NOT add the water to the lye, as it can result in a volcano-like reaction.

4. Stir this lye/water mixture until it has dissolved and let it sit for a few minutes. There will be a chemical reaction between the lye and water, and the water will become very hot, so be careful handling the container.

5. Place the melted tallow in the crockpot (if it’s not already there), and slowly stir the lye/water mixture in.

6. While stirring, proceed to blend the tallow, lye, and water until you reach trace. Trace is when the mixture turns to a pudding-like consistency and holds its shape when you drip a bit on top. You can use an immersion blender or stand blender if you’d like also. 

7. Now put the lid on the crockpot, set it on LOW, and allow it to cook for 45-60 minutes. It will bubble and froth, which is fine. Just keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t attempt to bubble out of the pot. If it attempts an escape, just stir it back down.

8. Pour into mold and let cure for MIN  2 weeks. The longer you wait. The harder the bar. 



TNote:

To make lye using the leeching method you pour a 50/50 mix of hardwood ashes and water into pale, let sit for 4 hrs, bring mix to a boil for 45 mins then let cool and ashes fall to the bottom of the pale.

Most people list off the polished highlights of their lives. Nothing wrong with that. But if I’m going to put myself out there, I might as well keep it real, right?

**So, here’s me, unfiltered:**

* I’ve got a solid career in higher ed, and I’m financially responsible, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t convinced myself I *needed* some random kitchen gadget at 2 a.m. that I’ll use exactly once.
* I can have a fridge full of groceries, a meal plan in place, and all the best intentions… and still find myself in the Taco Bell drive-thru at 10 p.m. on a Saturday.
* If we're on a roadtrip, I will absolutely spend 15 minutes debating the perfect gas station snack combo, and then when we actually get there, I'll walk out with a stick of beef jerky.
* I return my grocery cart like a responsible adult, but if I see a rogue one, I feel an unshakable duty to bring it back. It’s basically my version of community service.
* I enjoy a good hike (but let’s be real, half the motivation halfway through is knowing we'll stop for ice cream afterward).
* I can clean and organize like a responsible adult, but there is *always* that one chair where clean laundry goes to “rest” before it ever makes it to the closet.
* I like to cook, but sometimes, eating takeout straight from the container on the couch just feels *right*. Especially with one of those Netflix docuseries (if you know, you know).
* I eat a balanced diet and stay active, but the dad bod is holding its ground, and honestly, I respect its persistence. (Why do cookies have to taste so good? Ugh, first world problems.)
* I enjoy traveling, but I’m just as content with a slow Saturday morning, coffee in hand, with nowhere I *have* to be. On a more serious note, when I think about what happiness looks like when I'm 60, it's basically just being able to wake up with someone I love, and share a simple, down to earth moment like this. (And thankfully, no kids!).
* I have thoughtful, deep conversations… but I also have a completely unnecessary amount of knowledge about ‘90s pop culture that I will absolutely bring up at the least relevant time.

And holy crap, I just realized how many of those bullets above are about food, cooking, or groceries... Is it obvious I'm a foodie? At the end of the day, I’m just a guy who’s got his life together but doesn’t take himself too seriously, haha.

Basically, I'd like to connect with someone to sit on the couch with under a blanket, debating who should get up to refill our water glasses... one of us using the “I got up last time” argument. Maybe even trying to settle it with some rock-paper-scissors—until we both end up laughing because we know neither of us is actually *winning* this one. So we just get up together… and since we’re already in the kitchen, we grab some ice cream too.

**Ice cream solves everything.**

Not sure why I bolded that, but it seemed like a fitting conclusion to this post. Or maybe that's just my academia minded brain trying to do something edgy. Pretty crazy to think the person I may be sharing that coffee with on a Saturday morning when I'm 60 may be reading this post right now.

Manager Moved the Grinder, Now We’re Getting Burned—Need Advice & Sources

Hey everyone, I need some advice (or at least validation that I’m not crazy). My manager recently moved our espresso grinder from the right side of the counter to the left. There wasn’t really a reason—they just thought it “made more sense.” But ever since, it’s been completely throwing off our workflow, and my coworkers feel the same way. My manager has never worked in coffee as a barista and has only ever worked as a line cook, so he doesn’t even know how to pull a shot.

We’re all very experienced baristas, every one of us has been in coffee for at least five years, working at multiple cafés with different setups. If this were just an adjustment period, we’d be able to adapt. But it’s been a while now, and it still isn’t working for us. We’re all right-handed, and this new setup forces us into awkward movements that slow us down and make service feel clunky.

Worse, a few of us have actually gotten small burns because of how we’re now forced to move around the machine. Instead of taking us seriously, my manager is blaming us for the burns, acting like we’re just being careless.

We had a meeting about it, and instead of listening to our concerns, my manager basically shut us down, saying they only care about the data. According to them, drinks are going out at ABOUT six seconds faster this way, so that’s all that matters. The problem is, there are only five of us working at this café (not including the manager), and all of us hate the new setup. If every experienced barista on staff is saying it doesn’t work, that should mean something, right?

Has anyone dealt with something like this? What could I say to actually get my manager to take this seriously? Also, does anyone have any legit sources that say grinders should be on the right side for efficiency, ergonomics, or just common practice? I’d love to have something concrete to back us up.

TL;DR: Manager moved our grinder from the right to the left side of the counter, completely messing up our workflow. We’re all experienced baristas, all right-handed, and this new setup is unnatural, clunky, and causing small burns. Instead of taking us seriously, our manager only cares that drinks are six seconds faster this way and is blaming us for the burns. What can we say to get them to listen?

***EDIT: I shorten narcissist to narc, it's a common shortening from r/raisedbynarcissists***

TL;DR: my husband's narc mom wants to be part of our lives again after some time and improvements, but I'm afraid she still blames me for her problems and the cycle won't break

I (F29) have been with my husband (M30) for 5 amazing years (married for 1). He's one of the most kind, considerate, and funny people I've ever met. Unfortunately, part of why he is the way that he is, has to do with his mother being a narcissist and alcoholic. This woman has put him, his dad, and his sister through HELL over the years. She also started really going after my parents, especially my mom, in first subtle ways then worse and worse (I don't think she can handle seeing a healthy family dynamic because she grew up in a really dysfunctional one). She deteriorated a lot in the last 5 years, with the year leading up to our wedding and the year after being so bad that husband and I went no contact last July. After 8 months of mostly no contact, she reached out to him through a letter asking to meet for coffee and apologize. We were both wary, we wrote down a list of strict boundaries and he decided to go alone to keep variables at a minimum. Overall, he said the conversation went really well- she was the most coherent, calm, and positive he's ever seen her in his life. She's in intensive therapy for both narc and alcohol dependence, they moved out of their old town where her equally unhealthy family still lives (huge trigger), and she's adopted some really healthy habits and hobbies. She even reacted well to the strict boundaries set (she exploded on him last year when he first tried to establish them) which is all fantastic. 

Here's where I'm concerned/unsure: during their talk she admitted that she blamed my family and especially me for ""taking her son from her"" and ""ruining her family"" or whatever, and admitted it was wrong to do that. That's wonderful. But the way she talks about me is still with an edge that sounds like blame. She basically said that she now sees me as a necessary ""catalyst"" for these events (the cutting contact and her trying to get better). It sounded like she made sure to specify that I caused this whole thing by bringing my ""outside perspective"" to my husband, which caused him to cut contact with her. I have never told my husband to do anything but be careful around her, I'd never urge him to cut contact or try to ""take"" him from her. Yes, I've pointed out toxic things she's said or done, and yes, I said I would like to keep away from her, but I would never expect him to follow suit. It feels like she's still avoiding some of the responsibility for her behavior by sort of blaming me with a twist of ""but I'm glad she did this to us so it's all good"". Idk, I'm really conflicted. She isn't the first narc I've felt with, I was SA-ed by a narc bf in highschool, so I'll admit I'm pretty guarded and have a hard time giving the benefit of the doubt to any narc, let alone someone I've watched rip my husband and family to shreds. I'm just not sure if I'm being too sensitive about the wording or if it really does seem like she still wants to blame me, possibly to have ammunition for the future. She said she wants to see me and write me apology too, but I'm really twitchy and unsure about whether it's a good idea to give her more access. I'm afraid she'll relapse or use me to project her negativity at again; my husband already feels so much undeserved guilt and anxiety because of what she's done, he doesn't deserve any more. 

I haven't told my husband my feelings yet, I want to get an outside perspective first and think on it carefully

1j7b7hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNewGeezers/comments/1j7b7hu/fear_and_loathing_in_america/,Fear and Loathing in America,"The packing of the car had been uneventful. I checked and double-checked to make sure I had all the gear I need for an extended hibernation. I looked over the roof of the car, across the parking lot and past the train station, scouting for headlights. The only people awake at this hour would be me and the Law. 

I quickly ducked inside the car. The slamming of the door startled me, until I remembered I was the one who slammed it. This is why weed should not be consumed before 5AM. I fired up the Chevy, and as the engine warmed I sipped my scalding hot coffee and considered what I was about to do. The local Garda Síochána was pretty chill, so I figured the run down Cumberland would be easy. But then came the Jane Addams, and those were State Troopers all the way to the border. 

""Well, I guess this is it."" 

I looked over, expecting to see Jack, my attorney,  rummaging through the glove box, making sure I'd left the guns at home. The passenger seat was empty. I'd completely forgotten he'd already fled the State. I had planned on telling him his name is Jacques from now on. He would have argued about it, because he's good at that, but eventually he'd see the cachet, and Canadianness, of being Jacques. But it was not to be.  This would be a solo passage. I would be crossing 360 miles of American wilderness, without my attorney. I ran back upstairs to get the guns and more weed. 

Once, while waiting in the parking lot at Milwaukee County Stadium, one of Wisconsin's Finest approached me as I waited by my 82 foot long Cadillac. He wanted to ask about the Big Hurt, but pretended to be interested in the car.

""Probably need a car that big for big Frank, eh?""

""Let me ask you a question. Is it true that you will pick an Illinois car out of a pack of ten cars all doing the same speed, and pull them over?""

""Do you mean all the cars were speeding?""

""Well, let's say everyone is 10 over.""

""Oh, absolutely. I grab the Illinois car every time.""

I asked him why, and he launched into a spit-spattering stream of expletives about the Illinois State Police. It's a border thing. 

I kept that in mind as I blasted along through the morning mist of Belvidere. But there were complications. As I panned the horizon outside Rockford, I knew full well that I was already in territory that was very shaky. These fucking Rustic Tories aren't fooling me. If I break down out here, it's either coyotes or a roving pack of young Republicans that would set upon me.

I needed to hit one last fuel depot outside Rockford, and steeled my nerves in anticipation. It would be 12 minutes of playing it cool. Just hit the marks by the pump, feed the Chevy, and go about your business. The plaza was practically deserted, but for two Peterbilts idling in back. 

I gave silent thanks that there are no more hoses that you drive over that make a bell go DING DING inside the station. I hit my marks perfectly. I made sure to put the car in park before I got out. Deep breath, one more pull of lukewarm coffee, and out into the open air. I had stupidly left the gas mask in the back with the gear, but it turned out that the air was fine. When I got to the pump. I couldn't believe the price per gallon. I was about to go inside to complain, but decided that poor schmuck inside doesn't set the price of fuel. Besides, he might make me from the wanted posters. As I waited for the tank to fill, I casually looked around to make sure no cops were sneaking up on me. Now would be the time for them to pop me, out here, without my lawyer, Jacques.

It's impossible to get from Illinois to Minnesota without passing through the Zone of Terribleness. It extends from the eastern border with Indiana, to the southern border with Kentucky, to the southwest border with Missouri, to the western border with Iowa, and the northern border with Wisconsin. They've got us surrounded. It feels like being stuck in the house in *Night of The Living Dead*. I should have my fucking head examined for even trying this, but I don't have a choice. And the run through Wisconsin is the shortest route.

Approaching the border, I saw that the weigh stations were closed. I was astonished when I realized the border checkpoint was entirely unguarded! I crossed into the Zone without hesitating. I set the cruise at 65. Ahead lay Beloit and Janesville, home of Paul Ryan. I'd heard rumors about the locals having turned on Ryan, and ostracizing him like he was the enemy. The fools. Have they forgotten that it was just 12 short years ago that he suggested killing all the old people? 

By the time I hit Madison, I was sure I was mistaken about Wisconsin. The people, I mean. Nobody was flipping me off as I remained inconspicuous at 65 in the right lane. Nobody was snarling at me as they passed me. They were all going 80 miles an hour in their pickup trucks, and as god is my witness half of the crazy bastards were pulling boats! The other half were pulling trailers that were bigger than my apartment. I thought perhaps they too were fleeing the Zone, but that didn't explain the boats.

I kept my eyes forward, counting down the miles to Duluth. The road wound over wooded hills and through Wisconsin's rolling moraine. Past the Wisconsin Dells and Baraboo. Past the Serengeti Water Park. Mile after mile of picturesque farmland, and postcard red barns. I was confused, possibly because of the drugs. How could this be? Not one checkpoint. No sight of Sheriff John Brown for 250 miles. If these people are out to get me, they suck at it. 

By the time I hit Eau Claire, I was in a zone of my own. I can do this. I've been worrying about nothing. Just then, I realized I almost missed my exit for 53 north, and swerved right, just missing an F-150 with Wisconsin plates pulling a trailer, and a fucking boat! The rig was a hundred yards long if it was a foot. I looked in the mirror, expecting to see a muzzle flash. He waved at me politely. I acted like I meant to do that. He moved left, and headed west for the Twin Cities, while I stayed right, and continued north for Duluth. 

The coffee was catching up to me. This was a crisis. I couldn't hold off until Duluth, that was for sure. I knew that the Packers fans had shown me kindness so far, but that could have all been an act. The thought of stopping at a Wisconsin certified Rest Area filled me with dread. I knew I had my Big Gulp 32 OZ cup in the holder behind my right elbow, for moments just like this. I nodded to myself with confidence, and gave silent thanks for the limo days. There's an art to pissing while driving, and I had mastered the art. The only question was when and where to flush the Big Gulp. That's why I carry the 32 OZ cup. It would wait until the fuel depot in Duluth. 

With about 100 miles to go, I still had CCR's *Lodi* stuck in my head. 20 times I've made this run, and every time I pass the exit for Lodi, I try to imagine what life must be like in Lodi, Wisconsin. Then, for about an hour, it rattles around *...things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you know the tune. Oh lord, stuck in Lodi again.* I'll bet they do a lot of drugs in Lodi. Especially in the winter.

Outside Spooner, I began spooking in speanerisms. Again. Spooner, Wisconsin is the last human settlement on Rte 53. The signs bill it for 40 miles like it's Vegas, but it's mainly a truck stop and some hotels where musky fisherman stay on their trips to Hayward. Probably more drinking than drugs, drunking than drigs, in Spooner.

I could almost smell Lake Superior a mere 60 miles ahead. This trip had gone smoother than I'd feared. I still had an hour to go before I reached the safety of Minnesota, but traffic was light and the road was well maintained. I knew the main danger now was a surprise deer crossing. Most of the population of Wisconsin was behind me, with the exception of Superior. That was my last hurdle. I briefly entertained the idea of stopping for all the perch I can eat washed down with an Old Fashioned or three, but that was just arrogance. As delicious as that sounded, I knew that a Wisconsin Supper Club was the sort of place I'd cross paths with some of the older Packers fans, and they were certain to be well dressed, but likely well armed Tories just the same. I knew I had my guns, but why start an international incident over a perch dinner and an Old Fashioned, right?

Of course I caught every light in Superior, but now was not the time to freak out. Out the window was the Edward L Ryerson in dry dock, all 730 feet of her. I wondered if the skipper called Edward her, and if that caused problems with the Packers fans at the Supper Clubs in Superior. Ahead was the John Blatnik Bridge. The Brandenburg Gate separating Wisconsin from Minnesota. Once I was on it, I was home free. Even if I broke down, I could abandon the Chevy and make it to freedom on foot. Once beyond it, I'd be back with the Gustafsons. 

As the light turned green, and I passed over the bay below the bridge, I decided that a time will come when I'll have to stop in Wisconsin, possibly without my attorney. If and when the time comes, I think I'll be ready. They're not really bad people, if you stay away from the Supper Clubs. As I entered Duluth, and looked for Minnesota Rte 61, I settled down for a nice drive up the coast of Superior. I knew I'd need to stop one more time to refuel, and flush the Big Gulp, but now I was among the people who elected Tim Walz. These are my people.",4,1741537465.0,TheNewGeezers,12,1.0,False
1j7b7b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1j7b7b8/an_alternative_method_of_ranking_the_top_10_worst/,An Alternative Method of Ranking the Top 10 Worst NFL Teams of All Time,"Hello, when people think of the ""Worst Teams of All Time"", their mind usually goes to teams that couldn't win a single game, or if recency bias kicks in, they think of the worst team from the past season. And while the former is a reasonable way to look at things, I wanted to present an alternative perspective on the matter. I wanted to look at teams who were simply blown out almost every time they hit the field. 

Going by the Super Bowl Era onwards, I went season to season to find the worst MoV (Margin of Victory) rankings, and incredibly found a clean top 10 list of teams who lost by over two possessions per game (16.1 ppg or higher). I'm aware that the 2-point conversion did not exist in the NFL until 1994, but I still felt it made more sense to rank teams like this for consistency's sake. 

For the list, I will have the team name, followed by their MoV and Record in separate sets of parentheses, followed by a paragraph or so explaining how they enter NFL infamy [Example: 2018 Arizona Cardinals (-12.5 MoV) (3-13)], and throwing in arguably their worst loss of the season for the hell of it. I'll also be putting an asterisk next to teams who were in their first NFL season, because it's unreasonable to expect expansion teams to be good, though it doesn't fully excuse them from being as bad as they were. 

So, with that out of the way, here are the Top 10 teams that lost, on average, by more than 2 posessions in the Super Bowl Era (1966-) from ""best"" to worst:

10: 2000 Cleveland Browns (-16.1 MoV) (3-13) - To start off, we'll look at a team that barely averaged scoring double digits per game (10.1 PPG), and never scored above 24 points in a single one. Tim Couch, the 1999 #1 overall pick, was only below average, but only started 7 games. Doug Pederson, Eagles coaching legend, was once upon time a journeyman QB. Unfortunately for the Browns, he started 8 games this season and was atrocious, with a 55% competition percentage and 2-8 TD-INT ratio. Spurgeon Wynn started 1 game as well, but went 22-54 with no TDS and an INT. They also led the league in punting yards, and were shutout 4 times. ""Only"" being the 27th ranked scoring defense out of 31 teams saved them from being higher on the list. Still, this was one of the worst offensive teams of the modern era. 

Worst Loss: Week 14 vs. Jacksonville (0-48), who finished 7-9. Incredibly, the Browns had 2 total first downs in the game.


9: 2009 St. Louis Rams (-16.4) (1-15) - They barely managed to avoid being last in both points categories (32nd in scoring offense, 31st in scoring defense). The team was coming off a terrible 2-14 campaign in which their head coach was fired midway through the year. They replaced him with Super Bowl 42 hero Steve Spagnuolo, who swiftly proved to be out of his depth as a full blown head coach of a team. Though, I would also argue that the only above average player on the entire roster at the time was Steven Jackson, who somehow managed 1416 rushing yards despite a QB carousel of washed up Marc Bulger, bust Kyle Boller, and Keith Null (his last name is fitting because 0 people remember him), who combined for 11 TDS and 21 INTS. Their 1 win for the year was against a Lions team who had gone 0-16 the year before, and went 2-14 that year. 

Worst Loss: Week 4 @ 49ers (0-35), who finished 8-8, and were starting Shaun Hill at QB, Glen Coffee at RB, and whose starting WR's were Josh Morgan and 37-year old Isaac Bruce. 


8:  1966 Atlanta Falcons* (-16.6) (3-11) - This team also barely managed to avoid being last in both points categories, finishing 15/15 in scoring offense and 14/15 in scoring defense. The team started a pair of no-name QBS lost to history, Randy Johnson (not the MLB pitcher), who finished with an atrocious 43.7 completion percentage over 11 starts, and Dennis Claridge, who finished with a TD% of 2.9. Steve Sloan also played in 3 games, but only threw 13 passes for 0 TDS and 2 INTs. Their leading rusher wasn't horrible, finishing 9th in the league in rushing yards, but their top WR was only 21st in receiving yards, despite there only being 15 teams. They lost by 30 on 3 separate occasions. At least they were an expansion team. It could only go up from here...right?

Worst Loss: Week 6 vs. 49ers (7-44), who finished 6-6-2. They had a worse loss by points (3-56), but it was to the Packers, who were in the middle of a 3peat. While John Brodie, the 49ers QB, wasn't bad, that team still finished with a negative point differential. 


7: 1990 New England Patriots (-16.6) (1-15) - Somehow, they're the 3rd consecutive team on this list to finish last in points for (28th) and 2nd to last in points allowed (27th). They sported a pair of aging vets in Marc Wilson and Steve Grogan who'd had relatively productive careers, but in what would ultimately be both of their respective final seasons, were not. Between them and Tom Hodson, who only played in the NFL for 4 seasons, they combined for 14 TDS to 20 INTs. Meanwhile, the team finished with an abysmal 1398 rushing yards total, and overall finished with only 19 TDS as a team. They simply could not get into the endzone, finishing with only 3 games in which they scored 20 or more points. To make matters worse, a Boston Globe reporter sued the team after alleging that she was sexually harassed in their locker room. This would be the only year ever in which Rod Rust was a head coach, and probably for good reason. The real morale killer for the franchise, though, was that the team didn't even own their first-round pick for the 1991 draft. Their only win came by 2 points against a team who was starting a rookie QB. 

Worst Loss: Week 16 @ New York Jets (7-42), who finished that year 5-10. 


6: 1966 New York Giants (-17) (1-12-1) - The ""good"" news is that this team only finished 12th of 15 in points scored. If true, though, why the horrendous margin of defeat? Simple: They not only were the first team to ever allow 500 or more points in a season (and the only to do it in only 14 games), but even to this day, they still have the worst points per game allowed average in NFL history (35.8). Meanwhile, journeyman Earl Morrall joined the below average Gary Wood and one-year wonder Tom Kennedy to combine for 20 TDs to 31 INTs, while the team couldn't reach 1500 yards rushing total. In fact, no single player on the Giants reached even 350 yards rushing. Their two bright spots were Homer Jones, who somehow salvaged a 1,000 yard receiving season from the wreckage, and the CB Spider Lockhart, who made the Pro Bowl. The team lost by double digits 9 times in 14 games, and allowed 45+ points on 5 separate occasions. Maybe the most odd fact about this team is that this season was sandwiched between two 7-7 campaigns, all with the same head coach. 

Worst Loss: Week 12 @ Washington (41-72), who finished 7-7. There were worse blowouts, but giving up the most points in NFL history (72!) in a single game is more worth highlighting. 


5: 1981 Baltimore Colts (-17.1) (2-14) - After covering the team with the worst points per game allowed in a 14-game season, we move on to the team with that same distinction in a 16-game season (33.3 PPG allowed). They also gave up the most total yards in a season up until that point (6,793). The offense couldn't pick up the slack, though an older Bert Jones still managed a relatively average season with 21 TDs to 20 INT, along with a 57.3% completion rate. They actually scored a not horrible number of offensive TDS (31), but only 10 FG, making them quite boom-or-bust on each drive. Still, all of their opponents scored at least 21 points on them, and they allowed 35+ on 9 separate occasions. The team had 0 Pro Bowlers, too. Adding to the misery, their only 2 wins (by a combined 3 points) came against the other team that finished 2-14, the Patriots, meaning they missed out on the #1 overall pick. It's fair to wonder if this and the following 0-8-1 season were partial motivators for the team moving to Indianapolis in 1984, as the team had been fairly respectable for decades up until the late 70's and early 80's. It at the very least turned John Elway off on the idea of playing for the Colts. 

Worst Loss: Week 2 vs. Bills (3-35). To the Colts' credit, they were never blown out by a team who finished with under 10 wins. Their schedule was quite difficult. 


4: 1967 Atlanta Falcons (-17.6) (1-12-1) - It might seem unbelievable that the 2000 Browns were not the first time a team was worse in their second season compared to their first. That dubious distinction belongs to these Falcons. The team finished last in both offensive and defensive scoring, barely reaching 3,000 total offensive yards as a team for the season. The NFL's Randy Johnson returned to start 12 of 14 games, finishing with a better completion percentage (49.3%), but less TDs (10). Steve Sloan got another start at QB, but was still terrible, while Steelers flameout Terry Nofsinger also started in 1 forgettable performance. The team actually had the First Team All-Pro middle linebacker, Tommy Nobis, but he couldn't salvage a defense that allowed nearly double the passing yards that they their offense achieved. The team managed 1 tie vs. a 5-6-3 finishing Washington team, before getting a 1-point win two weeks later for their only win of the season, which was against the Vikings, who finished 3-8-3. They scored 7 or less points in 8 different games. In Hue Jackson-esque fashion, Norb Hecker, their head coach starting in 1966, kept his job until he was fired three games into the 1968 season, in which the falcons barely avoided this list (-15.7 ppg margin) for the 3rd consecutive season. 

Worst Loss: Week 4 vs. Philadelphia Eagles (7-38), who finished 6-7-1. 


3: 1973 Houston Oilers (-17.7) (1-13) - The team actually finished 1-13 the year before, and were the last team to finish with 1 win or fewer in consecutive seasons until the Browns of the mid 2010's. Though the team finished 23rd of 26 in scoring offense, they still scored barely 2 TDs a game, and finished with 11 passing TDs to 27 INTS, despite starting two different QBs who would eventually have respectable careers (Dan Pastorini and Lynn Dickey). They also finished with a league low 1388 rushing yards as a team. On the other hand, their last place scoring defense allowed almost 32 a game, one of the worst in NFL history. That was despite featuring Hall of Famer Elvin Bethea, who was in the middle of his long prime. Their one win was by 4 points against a Colts team that finished 4-10. The team rarely showed up on a week-to-week basis, losing by double digits in 11 of 14 games, while being blown out by 20+ multiple times against other bad teams. 

Worst Loss: Week 11 vs. New England Patriots (0-32), who finished 5-9, and had been unfathomably horrendous the year before. Perfect segue into the next entry on this list!


2: 1972 New England Patriots (-18.2) (3-11) - If one were to look at this team and the 1973 Oilers side-by-side, one may be led to believe that the Oilers were trying to emulate this team. They finished with the same last place scoring defense number (31.9 ppg), while finishing with even fewer Ppg scored (13.7), though they did at least finish only 24th of 26 teams. Still, it may seem odd how a team with a whopping 3 wins snuck its way this high on the list. There are two main reasons for this: 1. Their combined margin of victory in wins was 9 points (though how they defeated the eventual NFC champion Washington is beyond me). 2. They lost 8 separate games by at least 24 points. They were outrushed by their opponents by almost 1200 yards. Jim Plunkett, the #1 overall pick from the 1971 draft, started every game and finished with an unfathomable 8 TDs to 25 INTs. Brian Dowling, who lasted 3 total years in the NFL, also had 54 pass attempts, but couldn't get much done himself. The team had 0 Pro Bowlers. At this point, I'd also point out that the team earned only the 4th overall pick in the 1973 draft. But, they still ended up with John Hannah, considered by many to be the greatest guard of all time, so the team's suffering seems to have been worth it. At least a little. Nonetheless, this was the worst team on this list that can be critiqued without an asterisk, as the final team on this list was in their 1st as a franchise. 

Worst Loss: Week 11 @ Baltimore Colts (0-31), who finished 5-9. They also had a 0-52 loss to the Dolphins, but that team finished undefeated, so I'd consider that a ""better"" loss. 


1: 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers* (-20.5) (0-14) - You might've predicted this based on the reputation that precedes them. First team to go winless in the Super Bowl era. Those iconic creamsicle uniforms. John McKay's funny quotes. But not many know the specific reasons as to why they were so bad, besides being an expansion team. They managed to copy some other teams on this list by having the worst scoring offense in the league (28th) while having the 2nd to last scoring defense. However, even that's not the full story. They averaged only 8.9 ppg scored, tied for 4th worst since 1930. However, the teams ""ahead"" of them on said list had either average or just ""bad"" defenses. This Buccaneers team, meanwhile, also allowed almost 30 points a game. They managed only 1503 passing yards as a team, as former #3 overall pick Steve Spurrier concluded his career with a whimper. The team also had no Pro Bowlers. They only managed to score at least 20 on one occasion, while giving up less than 20 only twice. They scored in the single digits in half of their games. 

Worst Loss: Week 10 @ New York Jets (0-34), who went 3-11 and almost made this list (-15.3 margin of victory) during Lou Houltz's disastrous one season as an NFL Head Coach. The only reason why I can't blame them too much is because it was their first season, and the team had a god awful owner (Hugh Culverhouse). 


Notable Teams not on the Top 10 list:

1977 Buccaneers (-8.5) (2-12) Scored 7.4 points per game, lowest since 1944. However, the defense drastically improved, in large part due to rookie Lee Roy Selmon and his 13 sacks, and they allowed almost 2 less TDs per game compared to their 1976 counterpart. 

1980 Saints (-12.2) (1-15) The Aints. Their offense was actually 21st out of 28 teams in scoring. Still, their 1 win was by 1 point against a team who finished 4-12. 

1982 Baltimore Colts (-13.6) (0-8-1) Only team to go winless in a strike-shortened season in the Super Bowl Era. As mentioned earlier, may have contributed to them leaving for Indianapolis. 

1999 Cleveland Browns* (-13.7) (2-14) First season back in the NFL was somehow not as bad this year as the next. The expansion roster, similar to 2000, simply couldn't cut it in the NFL. 

2007 Miami Dolphins (-10.6) (1-15) A somewhat forgotten terrible team, their only win was in overtime against a Ravens team in the middle of a 9-game losing streak. Cam Cameron joined Rod Rust in his only head coaching season being a 1-15 season. 

2008 Detroit Lions (-15.5) (0-16) First winless team in a 16-game season. They sported a truly abhorrent defense (32.3 ppg allowed), to accompany an offense that scored just under 17 a game. Still, they had enough close shaves to avoid the list, including their 2-point loss as a result of Dan Orlovsky running out of the back of the endzone for a safety. 

2016 Cleveland Browns (-11.8) (1-15) and 2017 Cleveland Browns (-11) (0-16) Hue Jackson's masterpieces are the historically worst teams that are still fresh in many people's minds. They actually played a decent number of teams close, hence their relatively better margin of defeat average. Still, two missed kicks by Josh Lambo were the only thing saving the franchise from back-to-back 0-16 seasons. 

So, what does all this information mean? Nothing conclusive. I wanted to see how strong the correlation was between W-L record and MoV. The answer...a mixed bag. I'd like to claim that the teams on this list were more lucky than teams with a better MoV but worse record, but that's an oversimplification. There are a thousand factors that can affect the result of football games. Still, I do believe that looking at MoV is worth examining when determining how truly bad teams are.

My latest buy on Taobao, Pado 9bar, a stovetop coffee brewer. Works like a 9Barista, but it has 58mm portafilter, vs the original’s 53mm. So far, I’m happy with the build quality. It doesn’t feel cheap. But it’s less than half the price of the original. I’m loving it. Makes tasty espresso.

We love live music, skiing, outdoor hikes, parks, professional sports and community events. We work remote and really like the Sixteen Acres and East Forest park areas. We know if we want to see some big shows we’ll be comfortable driving to Boston or NYC. With all that being said, we’re really chill and don’t need a constant feed of activity until we want to do something fun and ok with driving to get there…Colorado’s a big state so we’re used to it! Looking for a location where we can hop on our bikes and start a relationship with a local coffee shop, microbrewery, and decent Italian food/pizza (NY style). We have visited the area a few years ago and fell in love with both places for different reasons but the vibe in MA is much more relaxed than CT. Was this just an anomaly? We are coming out next month and taking a week to explore to see where we feel most at home but don’t have a lot of time so looking forward to any helpful comments to plan our trip.

This is a franchised hotel owned and operated by Seawall Hospitality LLC, which also owns and operates The Saint Key West, Autograph Collection in Key West, Florida. This owner previously owned The Saint Hotel, Autograph Collection in New Orleans, Louisiana.

At Grand Galvez, Bonvoy platinum and higher elites do not get free coffee, juice or water with breakfast. Ironically, they provide free coffee in the lobby just outside the restaurant during breakfast service. They limit your breakfast options to muffins and pastries (the ""continental breakfast""), pancakes, and an ""all-American"" that includes eggs. If you try ordering the avocado toast, which doesn't include eggs, they'll charge you $20.

When I complained they comped my coffee for the duration of my stay and also allowed me to order the avocado toast. But other elites in the restaurant at the same time as me were still being cheated.",44,1741537133.0,marriott,17,0.89,False

1j7b2o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j7b2o8/delonghi_dedicaoxo_conical_bur_grinder/,[DeLonghi Dedica][OXO Conical bur grinder],"I'm relatively new to espresso making and still trying to get my bearings. I've watched numerous James Hoffmas espresso videos on youtube to understand the basics of dialing in shots, however, I keep running into the following issue:
My shots run much too quickly (18g beans, 36g output in 18-20sec) and as a result end up tasting very sour. I've tried to slow them down by using a finer grind setting, but I'm already on the finest grind my espresso machine will allow me to use without clogging up.
I don't know if maybe I'm going too fine and resulting in channeling, but the pucks look intact and the flow looks fine on the bottomless portafilter.
I'm using freshly roasted dark bean blend, rested 3-4days. They are teally nice and taste amazing at my local coffee shop.
I have pretty entry level equipment, and I'm not sure if that's my limitation or if I'm doing something wrong. But I feel like even this equipment should yield a half decent espresso. (OXO conical bur grinder, Delonghi dedica, hugh bottomless portafilter).
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1j7b0id,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1j7b0id/aio_at_my_best_friend_calling_my_boyfriend_nuts/,"AIO at my best friend calling my boyfriend “nuts” and responding to regular stories by calling me a “magnet for creeps,” seeing as she’s going through a difficult time with bad mental health?","TLDR: Friend of 12 years is going through a difficult time. We have both been there for each other through ups and downs. But, she has recently been making comments about my boyfriend being a ""psycho"" and ""nuts"" and about how I am ""nuts."" She recently had a bad experience and is claiming that ""she has always judged girls who let unhealthy guys into their lives"" and has also called me a ""magnet"" for ""creeps."" Not only is all of this not true, but it is incredibly hurtful to hear from the closest person in my life. I am wary that she is going through a difficult period in her own mental health, and I want to be sensitive to that. I don't know how to confront her without destroying the friendship.

This is very difficult for me to type out, so please bear with me. 

For background, I became friends with D (fake initial for purpose of post) during my first week at university abroad. We have been very close ever since, sharing mutual friends and following the same career path. We have been there for each other through countless ups and downs even after we graduated and I moved away. We text and send voice notes on a daily basis and joke that our chat is literally a diary for the past 12 years. I am a very hyper independent person and do not ordinarily reach out to people for help or if I need emotional support. However, D has been there for me through so much without me asking her and she is the only person in my life that I am comfortable reaching out to with a random grievance. 

That said, D tends to stress out over the little things (it is a common joke in our friendship group - with her knowledge) and that is not the easiest thing to deal with. Although it is emotionally taxing, it is something that I have become accustomed to and see as endearing. D also takes on more burdens than she should by caring for people who do not have her best interests at heart and this usually leads to her being hurt in the end. She is also a caretaker to her mother and sister, who deal with mental health issues and who have a destructive effect on her. I myself also put myself into situations when I bite off more than I can chew for other people, often going out of my way for others rather than for myself. 

A few years ago, I went through a difficult marriage and divorce. During that time, D patiently listened to me and was there for me throughout the ups and downs of it all. She listened to me and supported me more than my own family at home did. I would not have been able to make it through that period without her and I will be eternally grateful for it. 

Now, over the past two years, I have been in a relationship that involved a lot of ups and downs and break ups (I'll call him N for the purpose of this post). I know that it is not the healthiest relationship. Other than loving and caring for the guy however, there are logical reasons why I have let the relationship continue. I live at home (in my country, all unmarried people live at their parent's home and it is incredibly taboo not to) with an incredibly difficult mother and family who fundamentally do not understand me. I also do not feel understood by my friends in my country. While I have always been an introvert and enjoyed my own company, I have been feeling incredibly lonely for the first time in my life. I am incredibly successful in my career, which means that I do well with work but the workplace can also bring with it a fair share of toxic office politics. 

N came into my life shortly after my divorce and, even though he is not the best match for me, he developed into the only comfort zone for me in my country. He is the only person in this country that I can truly be myself around. He is non-judgmental and we share very similar day-to-day interests. Our fights, however, have been toxic primarily owing to his own insecurities and anger issues. He has struggled with work and the misogynistic expectations of his parents, which has taken a mental toll on him in life. After urging from my part, he is currently in therapy and working on his mental health. We had numerous toxic breakups and I hate the fact that I am stuck in this cycle. However, I know that he is growing as a person and, for the time being at least, we have been comfort zones for each other. As someone who never admits that I need things, I have come to admit that I need this person in my life. I don't have a 'plan' for where this relationship is going, but for now I am really trying to be kind to myself  - I am battling so much in relation to my own mental health, career, and family that I do not have the emotional capacity to deal with this as well.

In the meantime, over the past year, D has had a very difficult year emotionally and I have been there for her as well. The reality is that she got herself into absurd situations and reacted to them in a way that is 'abnormal' from a mental health perspective. There was a lot that she was not discussing with her husband and instead discussed with me. I am happy to be there for her, but it has been emotionally taxing to do so. For example, while she is in a different time zone, I have her on my 'favourites' so I can answer her calls at all times of night. She has woken me up on many occasions and I have listened as she went on a painstakingly long rant. She is not receptive to advice when I give it to her, so I became accustomed to my advice being discounted and do not express judgment or 'I told you so's' when she wants to talk about the situation over and over again. 

One situation was an emotional attachment she developed to a man who was not her husband. Despite it all, I have understood where this came from and have been there for her, trying to help her detach from him and understanding that it was difficult. I also recognise that the extent of her attachment and how she is coping likely relates to her underlying mental health state. 

While she was dealing with this situation, she repeated a comment a few times that really hurt me. She said: ""I have always attracted good guys into my life and had healthy relationships. And I always judged girls who got themselves into relationships with unhealthy guys, as I thought they were idiots and weak for staying in these drama-filled relationships."" She said this THREE times and I ignored each time. On the fourth occasion, I eventually cut her off and told her to stop deluding herself, that she is lucky to have her husband in her life, and changed the conversation. But, I was genuinely hurt and stopped discussing my relationship with her for some time after that - it is difficult for me to open up to people and I hated feeling judged by the one person I opened up to the most. 

To add to this, she started making more comments. For example, a random professional contact started reaching out to me to ask me for coffee and his approach really bothered me - so I ranted about it to D. Her response: ""You attract so many creeps. I've only had to deal with one of them. For you, they're a permanent fixture in your life hahahaha."" I felt this was truly MEAN. I wanted to respond with: ""I attract male attention on a constant basis"" but refrained. The reality is that I am an objectively attractive female and have dealt with the cons of getting disproportionate male attention - from constant cat-calling to unwarranted advances to having to put strict boundaries with men in my professional field. The way she reacted to this one innocent rant bothered me so much - I DO NOT attract creeps. I attract a wide range of men in my life. I had one very bad marriage and I do not like feeling judged for it. And, I have a relationship that involves struggles, but the guy is far from a creep - he is a good, decent man who is flawed and so am I. Honestly, I felt like she said it just to make herself feel better about her current situation so, although I thought it was mean, I let it go and did not respond. 

She then decided to share a story about her friend who is being ghosted by a guy who led her on and compared it to her attachment/situationship with the other guy. She then made the comment about how her other friend ""is so strong for not chasing the guy who is giving her mixed signals and is strong enough to have standards...but oh I don't mean to refer to you and N, it just crossed my mind now."" I was fuming - I simply told her: ""I know it has nothing to do with me and N because, for all of his flaws, he was always consistent with me and never wavered in his commitment."" (The relationship developed gradually and, at each stage, he communicated his feelings and told me that he is happy to move at a slower or faster pace based on my preference. He was also always consistent and never hot-or-cold - on the contrary, I was the avoidant one). She just responded with: ""at least there's that."" 

Over the past few weeks in particular, I have been struggling with a very high workload and long hours, coupled with my Mum being a nightmare and me being uncomfortable at home. D knows that N is my comfort zone in all of this - he lets me be me and is there for me when I need him. Also, D has been spiralling a lot and I have been there for her, which adds to how emotionally drained I have been lately (although I never said this to her as I want to be there for her). She nevertheless has made comments about N ""being crazy"" and ""being a psycho"" and that ""I am too good for him."" I find these comments to be unwarranted and insensitive - she knows that I love him and surely there would be better ways to express her concerns. There are concerns in the relationship due to his insecurities and temper, but he has never reached a level close to violence or made me feel unsafe. 

The day before yesterday, I sent her a voice note saying that I enjoyed my night for the first time in ages - took some time off of work and chilled with N. N has recently dealt with issues with his parents and I was conveying how maturely he is dealing with it all. We also talked about our relationship and I conveyed to her those conversations, which I felt got us closer and made me feel comfortable. I had later messaged her that I am really struggling with work and that he is the only safe space I have. In the voice note, I gave an account of how he said something along the lines of: ""I've slipped up in the past by saying these I shouldn't have out of my own stupidity and ignorance in dealing with things, but I'm working on it. And while I may be stupid at times, I will never do anything to hurt you and to hurt the bond that we are building together, which means so much to me."" She sent angry messages calling me ""stupid"" and ""idiotic"" and saying ""I should thank him for telling me that he will make mistakes again in the future."" (Um, duh - I know he's working on himself, but I'm not naive enough to believe he will never make mistakes again...what I do care about, however, is his accountability, his good intent, and that he is working on it.) She sent more angry messages saying: ""HE IS NUTS! YOU ARE NUTS!"" She continued to call him ""crazy,"" ""nuts"" and that I'm being ""stupid"" and that ""I know what I need to do."" She then said ""This is nuts. God help you both."" 

I have not been able to speak to her since. She then continued to send me pictures of her on vacation with her husband and content about international women's day casually...I cannot bring myself to respond. I am so deeply hurt. First, I do not think it is fair for her to call someone who I love and care about to be ""nuts"" or ""crazy"" or any of her other terms. Even if she has concerns, there is surely a more empathetic way to put it. Second, just the day before, I had listened to her rant about her husband's anger and mood issues - as always, I listen patiently and try to give caring and cautious advice. Not once did I describe her husband negatively. Not once did I describe her own mental health issues negatively, even though many people may objectively describe her emotional affair and other conduct as being ""nuts."" Third, I was talking about what a difficult time I was going through - surely she could have avoided adding to it and left her concerns for another time. Fourth, I can't help but feel like there is a lot of judgment and pretentiousness, which seems to be underlying her discussions with me. I feel incredibly judged by the one person who I've opened up the most to. She is the only person who I discuss my relationship and mental health with. Yes, she has a great husband and is incredibly successful in her career, but I don't think that gives her the right to lord herself over others and not me as her friend. 

If you've read this far, thank you. Any advice on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated. I am debating whether to confront her or just let it go for the sake of the friendship. I feel like I won't be able to confront her without me saying something that she will take personally and which will forever damage our friendship. She’s very vulnerable right now. Am I overreacting?

Went to Dunkin Donuts and picked up from the drive-thru.  As I was grabbing my coffee (not looking at the window) a different employee ducked their head towards the window and said “Heil [redacted in case this post gets flagged]” and ducked out before I could even see their face.  The attendant at the window said “I apologize for their behavior”.  

As I was driving away, the shock started to wear off and I started processing what happened.  I wanted to check on the attendant who was seemingly a bystander and see if they were okay, as well as sus out who was acting inappropriately so that I could call management’s attention to it.

So I turned around and sat in the store for a few minutes, waiting for a slight lull in business to check in with the attendant first.  I asked if they felt safe and everything was alright. I then said of course all people who say that are cowards and it wasn’t surprising because if I had more time to react I probably would have thrown my hot coffee at his face.

Surprisingly the attendant pointed out the person who said it, and they did not fit the profile of a common bigot (definitely not white). And as I was confronting him, he pulled out his phone to start recording. I then realized exactly what was happening; this idiot was rage-baiting for content. So I just calmly said “I’m not going to be a part of your video.” and walked out.  

The worst part of this is there were several people working there and none of them told him to stop, which makes me believe that there may have even been a plan to take turns with rage-baiting unsuspecting customers and filming them. At the very least they were being complicit in his harassment.
